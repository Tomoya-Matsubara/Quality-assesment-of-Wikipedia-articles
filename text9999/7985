'''Cysteine''' is a naturally occurring, [[sulfur]]-containing [[amino acid]] that is found in most [[protein]]s, although only in small quantities. Cysteine is unique amongst the [[List of standard amino acids|twenty natural amino acids]] as it contains a [[thiol]] group. Thiol groups can undergo [[redox|oxidation/reduction (redox)]] reactions; when cysteine is [[oxidation|oxidised]] it can form '''[[cystine]]''', which is two cysteine residues joined by a [[disulfide bond]]. This reaction is reversible: as reduction of this disulphide bond regenerates two cysteine molecules. The disulphide bonds of cystine are crucial to defining the structures of many proteins.

Cysteine is often involved in [[redox|electron-transfer]] reactions, and help the enzyme [[catalysis|catalyse]] its reaction. Cysteine is also part of the antioxidant [[glutathione]].

N-acetyl-<small>L</small>-cysteine ([[NAC]]) is a form of cysteine where an [[acetyl group]] is attached to cysteine's nitrogen atom and is sold as a dietary supplement. Cysteine is named after cystine, which comes from the Greek word ''kustis'' meaning [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] <U+2212> cystine was first isolated from [[kidney stone]]s.

==Reactions==
As cysteine contains a [[thiol|sulphydryl group]], it can undergo [[redox|redox reactions]]. Oxidation of cysteine can produce a [[disulfide bond]] with another thiol, or further oxidation can produce sulphfinic or [[sulfonic acid]]s. 

The cysteine thiol group is also a [[nucleophile]] and can undergo [[nucleophilic addition|addition]] and [[nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. Thiol groups become much more reactive when they are ionised, and cysteine residues in proteins have [[acid dissociation constant|pK<sub>a</sub>]] values close to neutrality, so are often in their reactive [[thiolate]] form in the cell.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bulaj G, Kortemme T, Goldenberg D | title = Ionization-reactivity relationships for cysteine thiols in polypeptides. | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 37 | issue = 25 | pages = 8965-72 | year = 1998 | id = PMID 9636038}}</ref>

The thiol group also has a high [[affinity]] for [[heavy metals]] and proteins containing cysteine will [[chelation|bind]] metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium tightly.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Baker D, Czarnecki-Maulden G | title = Pharmacologic role of cysteine in ameliorating or exacerbating mineral toxicities. | journal = J Nutr | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 1003-10 | year = 1987 | id = PMID 3298579}}</ref>

==Biological functions==
Due to this ability to undergo redox reactions, cysteine has [[antioxidant]] properties. Cysteine is an important source of [[sulfur]] in human [[metabolism]], and although it is classified as a [[non-essential amino acid]], cysteine may be essential for infants, the elderly, and individuals with certain metabolic disease or who suffer from [[malabsorption]] [[syndromes]]. Cysteine may at some point be recognized as an essential or conditionally essential amino acid.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

'''Cysteine and Glutathione:''' Cysteine is an important [[precursor]] in the production of glutathione in the body and other organisms. The systemic availability of oral glutathione (GSH) is negligible; the vast majority of it must be manufactured intracellularly. Glutathione is a [[tripeptide]] antioxidant made up of the three amino acids cysteine, [[glycine]] and [[glutamate]]. Glutamate and glycine are readily available in most North American diets, but the availability of cysteine makes it be the rate-limiting [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] for the synthesis of glutathione within the cell. It is the sulfhydryl (thiol) group (SH) of cysteine that serves as [[proton]]-donor and is responsible for the biological activity of glutathione.<ref name="http://www.ammunotec.com/glutathione.html">[http://www.ammunotec.com/glutathione.html (1)]</ref> 

'''Absorption:''' The free amino acid cysteine (supplied supplementally by [[NAC]]) does not represent an ideal delivery system to the cell. Cysteine is potentially toxic and is spontaneously [[catabolized]] in the gastrointestinal tract and blood plasma. Conversely, cysteine absorbed during digestion as [[cystine]] (two cysteine molecules linked by a disulfide bond) in the gastrointestinal tract is more stable than the free amino acid cysteine. Cystine travels safely through the GI tract and [[blood plasma]] and is promptly reduced to the two cysteine molecules upon cell entry.<ref name="http://www.ammunotec.com/glutathione.html">[http://www.ammunotec.com/glutathione.html (1)]</ref>

==Biochemistry==
Cysteine contains a thiol group, which can display [[nucleophilicity]]. Some important cysteine-derived nucleophiles include [[ubiquitin]] [[ligases]], which transfer ubiquitin to its pendant proteins, and [[caspases]], which engage in proteolysis in the apoptotic cycle.  [[Intein]]s often function with the help of a catalytic cysteine.  These roles are typically limited to the intracellular milieu, where the environment is reducing, and cysteine is not oxidized to cystine.

Cysteines play a valuable role by crosslinking proteins.  This increases the molecular stability in the harsh extracellular environment, and also functions to confer proteolytic resistance (since protein export is a costly process, minimizing its necessity is advantageous).  Intracellularly, disulfide bridges between cysteines within a polypeptide support the protein's secondary structure.  [[Insulin]] is an example of a protein with cystine crosslinking, where two separate peptide chains are connected by a pair of disulfide bonds. 

[[Protein Disulfide Isomerase]]s catalyze the proper formation of [[disulfide bonds]]; the cell transfers dehydroascorbic acid to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] which oxidises the environment.  In this environment, cysteines are generally oxidized to cystine and no longer functions as a nucleophile.

==Dietary sources==
Cysteine can be found in meat, red peppers, garlic, onions, broccoli, brussel sprouts, oats, milk, whey protein, and wheat germ.  However, it is not classified as an [[essential amino acid]], and can usually be synthesized by the human body under normal physiological conditions if a sufficient quantity of [[methionine]] is available.

==Production==
It is interesting to note that currently the cheapest source of material from which food grade [[L-cysteine]] may be purified in high yield is by [[hydrolysis]] of molecules in [[human hair]]. Other sources include feathers and pig bristles. The companies producing cysteine by hydrolysis are located mainly in [[China]].  There is some debate whether or not consuming L-cysteine derived from human hair constitutes [[cannibalism]].
Although many other amino acids were accessible via [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] for some years, L-Cysteine was unavailable until 2001 when a [[Germany|German]] company introduced a production route via fermentation (non-human, non-animal origin.)

A source of bonded cysteine (cystine) is '''''undenatured''''' bovine [[whey]] protein; this is the same form as that in human breast milk.

==Applications==
Cysteine (mostly in the naturally occurring form L-cysteine) is used for applications in the food, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. One of the largest applications is the production of various flavors. For example, reacting cysteine with sugars in a [[Maillard reaction]] yields meat flavors. L-cysteine is also used as a [[improving agent|processing aid]] for baking. Small quantities (in the tens of ppm range) help to soften the dough and thus reduce processing time.

The cysteine derivative [[N-acetyl cysteine]] (NAC) is often used as a cough medicine as it breaks up the disulfide bonds in the [[mucus]] and thus liquefies it, making it easier to cough up. NAC is also used as a dietary supplement as already indicated above.

In the field of personal care, cysteine is used for [[permanent wave]] applications predominantly in Asia. Again the cysteine is used for breaking up the disulfide bonds in the [[hair]]'s [[keratin]].

Cysteine is a very popular target for site-directed labeling experiments to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics.  [[Maleimide]]s will selectively attach to cysteine using a covalent michael-addition.  [[Site-directed spin labeling]] for EPR also uses cysteine extensively.

In a 1994 report released by five top [[cigarette]] companies, cysteine is one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. Its use or purpose, however, is unknown, like most cigarette additives.<ref name="http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/nicotineinhaler/a/cigingredients.htm">[http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/nicotineinhaler/a/cigingredients.htm http://quitsmoking.about.com/cs/nicotineinhaler/a/cigingredients.htm]</ref>  Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: Acting as an [[expectorant]], since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; and increasing the beneficial antioxidant [[glutathione]] (which is diminished in smokers).

==Sheep==
[[Image:Cystine-skeletal.png|thumb|right|150px|[[Cystine]], showing [[disulfide bond]]]]

Cysteine is required by [[sheep]] in order to produce wool, however it is an essential amino-acid that cannot be synthesised by the sheep and must be taken in as food from grass.  This means that during drought conditions sheep stop producing wool; however, [[transgenic]] sheep have been developed which can make their own cysteine.

==Hangover Remedy==
Cysteine has been linked to aiding in the remedy of certain [[hangover]] symptoms. It directly counteracts the poisonous effects of [[acetaldehyde]], a particularly toxic by-product of alcohol in the human body.  Cysteine attracts the toxin, breaking it down into the non-toxic [[acetate]], a substance similar to vinegar.  The actual effectiveness of consuming cysteine as part of a hangover remedy is unclear.<ref name="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-004.shtml">[http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-004.shtml http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-004.shtml]</ref>
