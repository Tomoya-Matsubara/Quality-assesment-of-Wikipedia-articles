'''HMS ''Amboyna''''' was the Dutch [[brig]] ''Harlingen'', which the British captured in the East Indies in 1796. They renamed her ''Amboyna'' after their recent capture of [[Ambon Island]]. She then served briefly in the Royal Navy before she was broken up in 1802.

==Capture==
In early 1796 Commodore [[Peter Rainier, junior|Peter Rainier]] sailed a squadron consisting of {{HMS|Suffolk|1765|2}} (his flagship), {{HMS|Centurion|1774|2}}, {{HMS|Resistance|11782|2}}, {{HMS|Orpheus|1780|2}}, {{HMS|Swift|1793|2}}, one or two armed vessels belonging to the [[East India Company]], and three transports with troops, towards the Dutch possessions in the East Indies.<ref>James (1837), vol. p.372.</ref> On their way as they were passing through the [[Bangka Strait|Straits of Banca]], on 22 January they sighted a strange sail. Lieutenant William Hugh Dobbie, fifth lieutenant of ''Suffolk'' took her launch to investigate. When it became obvious that the vessel was a becalmed Dutch naval brig, ''Suffolk{{'}]''s boats joined him. Towards early evening, a breeze came up, which enabled the brig to make sail. Dobbie and the boats gave chase, firing their [[swivel gun]]s as their quarry fired them. Eventually, ''Orpheus'' came up and at 2am captured the brig at 2am. She was the ''Harlingen'', of 14 guns and 45 men.<ref name=MarshallS1>Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp.138-40.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=18245|startpage=1064|date=6 May 1826}}</ref> Rainier put Dobbie in command of ''Harlingen''. 

On 16 February 1796 the squadron arrived off [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]], Molucca islands and landed troops who were able to take possession without facing any resistance. Then on 7 March, the squadron arrived off [[Great-Banda]], or [[Banda-Neira]] and again landed troops, this time taking possession after facing only a little resistance. ''Orpheus'' and ''Harlingen'' covered the landing, their fire silencing a battery.<ref name=MarshallS1/> 

The Admiral found in the Treasury at Amboyna, 81,112 [[Rixdollar]]s, and in store 515,940 pounds (weight) of cloves; in the Treasury at Banda-Neira 66,675 Rix dollars, and 84,777 pounds of nutmeg, 19,587 pounds of mace, and merchandise and other stores.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13956|startpage=1158|endpage=1159|date=29 November 1796}}</ref>  Estimates suggest that each of the captains in Rainier's squadron received <U+00A3>15,000 in prize money.

==Service==

The day after Banda capitulated, i.e., on 9 March, Rainier had ''Harlingen'' purchased into the Navy and commissioned her as ''Amboyna'', with Dobbie as her captain.<ref name=MarshallS1/> Rainier intended to have ''Amboyna'' sail back to England with Captain Robert Lambert (of ''Suffolk'') and the dispatches announcing the victory. At the last minute news arrived of an uprising by the local populace, who were Moslem, against the Dutch on Ambon. Rainier sent ''Orpheus'' to Madras with the dispatches instead, and ''Amboyna'' to Ambon to support the Dutch. ''Amboyna'' spent April and May on this mission before the Anglo-Dutch forces were able to suppress the insurgency.<ref name=MarshallS1/>

Rainier then had ''Amboyna'' escort a ship with a cargo of spices to China. Dobbie's mission was also to procure supplies for the British squadron in the Moluccas. When ''Amboyna'' arrived at Macao, it was discovered that she would have to be put on her side to repair damage from a grounding in the [[Sulu Sea]]. While Dobbie went up to [[Huangpu District, Guangzhou|Whampoa]], he left ''Amboyna'' in the Typa (inner harbour) under the supervision of Lieutenant Arthur Farquhar, a friend who had traveled on her as a supernumerary. While she was being turned on her side, a gang of "ladrones" (thieves) attempted to capture and loot her; fortunately Farquhar was able to drive them off.<ref name=MarshallS1/>

Dobbie returned to ''Suffolk'' in December 1797. Lieutenant Joseph Pulham then replaced him as captain of ''Amboyna''.<ref name=Winfield/> Rainier appointed Lieutenant [[Peter Heywood]] of ''Suffolk'' on 17 May 1799 to take command of ''Amboyna'', which was then at Mangalore, to sail her to Madras. There he was to take the dispatches reporting the [[Battle of Seringapatam]], which were expected momentarily. However, when Heywood reached Madras he discovered that the dispatches had already left for England on a merchant vessel hired for the purpose. Heywood then immediately returned to the ''Suffolk''.<ref>Taggart (1832), pp.169-70.</ref>

On 14 June 1799, Rainier appointed Lieutenant [[Nesbit Willoughby|William Josiah Willougby]] to command ''Amboyna''. Willoughby had been a midshipman on ''Suffolk'' at the capture of Ambon and Banda, and just emerged from a year under arrest. He had demanded a courtmartial after Captain William Clark of {{HMS|Victorious|1785|2}}, on which he was then serving, had arrested him for "disrespectful behaviour" and then withdrawn the charge. The court martial found Willougby guilty but had sentenced him to time served and ordered him reinstated to his rank; the court martial also exonerated Clark. Willoughby declined the appointment due to ill-health brought on by his confinement and returned to England.<ref>'"Dictionary of National Biography", (1900), Vol. 62 (Williamson-Worden), pp. 37-8.</ref>
 
Lieutenant Robert Sheldrake took command of ''Amboyna'' in April 1800. His replacement, in 1801, was Lieutenant John Cawley.<ref name=Winfield/>

==Fate==
''Amboyna'' was sold in 1802 for breaking up.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.337.</ref>
