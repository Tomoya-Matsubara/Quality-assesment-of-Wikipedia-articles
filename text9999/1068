== History of Akbank T.A.<U+015E> ==

Akbank was founded in Adana in January [[1948]], originally to provide financing for the cotton producers in the region. Growing and developing over time, the Bank opened its first branch in [[Istanbul]] in the district of Sirkeci on July 14, 1950, moving its Headquarters to [[Istanbul]] in 1954. Rapidly increasing the number of its branches, Akbank automated all banking operations in 1963. The Bank<U+2019>s first international representative office was opened in Frankfurt, Germany. The first Turkish private sector bank to be established abroad, Ak International Ltd., its name later to be changed to [[Sabanc<U+0131> Bank]], was established in 1983. The Bank also established Ak Securities in 1996, Ak Investment Fund in 1998, Ak Asset Management and the Bank<U+2019>s Private Banking Department in 2000 and Ak Pension Fund in 2003. Akbank expanded its international network in 2002 with the launch of Akbank NV in the Netherlands. Akbank incorporated Ak Financial Leasing in 2005. In February 2006, a decision of the Board of Directors of the Bank initiated the sale of Ak Pension Fund to the insurance company Aksigorta.

In addition to its core banking activities, Akbank also offers a wide range of retail, commercial, corporate, private banking and international trade finance services. Non-banking financial, capital market and investment services are provided by the Bank<U+2019>s subsidiaries. With its use of the latest advances in technology and its staff of experienced bankers, Akbank continues to focus on providing the highest quality services to a wide-ranging private and corporate clientele.

Akbank operates through its Headquarters in Istanbul and its 13 Regional Directorates in Turkey. With a strong and extensive distribution network that includes 658 branches and 11,186 employees, Akbank provides services beyond traditional distribution channels, through its Retail and Corporate Internet Branches, its Telephone Banking Center, 1,502 ATMs, 136 BTMs, 217,198 POS terminals and the latest technology channels such as kiosks, cell phones and palm-PC platforms. In addition, a Freedom Banking Area has been set up within branch premises to allow customers to access its Internet and Telephone Banking platforms.

Akbank has a branch in [[Germany]] and one in [[Malta]]. Akbank has 100% ownership of Akbank NV established in the [[Netherlands]] and 65% of the London-based Sabanc<U+0131> Bank. In February 2006, a <U+201C>Share Purchasing Agreement<U+201D> was signed with regard to the sale of Sabanc<U+0131> Bank shares. Akbank, which previously owned 39.99% of the shares of Istanbul-based BNP-Ak-[[Dresdner Bank]], acquired an additional 60% of the shares from foreign partners in 2005 thereby merging this bank to its structure.

Its strong capital base, stable deposit structure, ability to procure low-cost funding and robust growth in total assets combine to make Akbank the most profitable bank in the private sector in [[Turkey]]. At year-end 2005, Akbank<U+2019>s gross profit was YTL 2,078 million (approx. US$ 1,547 million) while total assets reached YTL 52,385 million (approx. US$ 38,098 million). The capital adequacy ratio of the Bank is one of the highest in the sector at 21.4%.

[[Euromoney Magazine]] selected Akbank as Turkey<U+2019>s Best Bank for the seventh time in 2005. 

In 2005, Akbank continued to obtain credits from overseas markets at favorable terms and the amount of these resources reached a total of US$ 5,217 million.

Some 33.7% of Akbank shares are publicly traded and listed on the [[Istanbul Stock Exchange]] (ISE). Abroad, the Bank<U+2019>s Level 1 ADRs are traded on the London IOB and the OTC market in the US. As of December 31, 2005, the Bank<U+2019>s market value stood at US$ 14,756 million, making it the corporation with the second highest market value on the ISE.
