'''''SpongeBob's Truth or Square''''' is a 2009 [[television film|made-for-television]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Andrew Overtoom]], [[Alan Smart]] and [[Tom Yasumi]]. The film stars [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Rodger Bumpass]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], and [[Mr. Lawrence]]. The film originally aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States on November 6, 2009, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the American [[animation|animated]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. 

The series  follows the adventures of the title character in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. In the film, SpongeBob and his friends accidentally locked inside the [[Krusty Krab]] on the day of its "eleventy seventh" anniversary celebration. As they crawl through the [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation system]] trying to escape, they look back on shared memories through flashback moments.

The film was written by [[Luke Brookshier]], Nate Cash, [[Steven Banks]], and [[Paul Tibbitt]]. [[Rosario Dawson]], [[LeBron James]], [[Tina Fey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Craig Ferguson]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Ricky Gervais]] guest starred in the film as themselves. Upon release, the film attracted an estimated 7.7 million viewers, and met mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
[[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] ([[Tom Kenny]]) realizes that the [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant is celebrating its "eleventy seventh" (one hundred and seventeenth) anniversary. He remembers his first visit to the Krusty Krab and tells [[Gary the Snail|Gary]] about it. SpongeBob then leaves to go to the Krusty Krab, but as soon as he exits his house, he bumps into the back of a long line of customers waiting to get to the restaurant as well. SpongeBob jumps on top of every person in the line, then eventually reaches the Krusty Krab.

[[Mr. Krabs]] ([[Clancy Brown]]) tells SpongeBob and [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]] ([[Rodger Bumpass]]) that it is a perfect opportunity for his former best friend [[Plankton (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Plankton]] ([[Mr. Lawrence]]) to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] ([[Bill Fagerbakke]]) as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|security guard]], so that he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the [[freezer]] where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty [[ice sculpture]] which he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that there is a way to escape without using the door, which is through the [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation system]]. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.

To get out of the air shaft, SpongeBob molds Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs into a [[battering ram]] to bust out the shaft, and he finally makes it out, only to find that all the customers have left after waiting for so long without getting any food. However, SpongeBob summons them all back as he sings a song in honour of the Krusty Krab. Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having been caught by Mr. Krabs. The eleventy seventh anniversary celebration then goes ahead.

The film received mixed critical response from critics and fans alike. Nancy Basile of the [[About.com]] gave the film positive reviews and wrote "I had doubts that the recent ''Truth or Square'' special of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' would be funny or clever. I was quite wrong." She added that "My kids and I were mesmerized."<ref>{{cite web|last=Basile|first=Nancy|title=Truth or Square Turns Out Well-Rounded|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/b/2009/11/14/truth-or-square-turns-out-well-rounded.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=14 November 2009}}</ref> Jose Strike of the [[Animation World Network]] positively reacted to the film and wrote "''Truth or Square'' is a major treat; in fact, I'm so happy I think I'll drop on the deck and flop like a fish..."<ref>{{cite web|last=Strike|first=Joe|title=TV Review: SpongeBob SquarePants: Truth or Square|url=http://www.awn.com/blogs/miscweant/ddd|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=3 May 2013|date=6 November 2009}}</ref> Ian Jane of [[DVD Talk]] said "''Truth Or Square'' isn't your typical episode, as it mixes up a lot of live action material in with the more traditional animated sequences to very unusual effect."<ref name=Jane>{{cite web|last=Jane|first=Ian|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Truth or Square|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39169/spongebob-squarepants-truth-or-square/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=27 May 2013|date=10 November 2009}}</ref> He added "[...]but there's enough here in terms of the gags and the jokes that even if it's not a classic episode, it's still one worth seeing."<ref name=Jane/> Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson said that the film is her favorite among the series.<ref name=Animation/>

However, the film was not immune to negative reception, and was criticized mainly due to the "Patchy the Pirate" segments. Paul Mavis from DVD Talk said "''Truth or Square'' is a strange mix of some truly memorable animated ''SpongeBob'' moments interrupted unfortunately by the largely unfunny Patchy the Pirate segments."<ref name=Mavis>{{cite web|last=Mavis|first=Paul|title=SpongeBob SquarePants: Truth or Square|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/41269/spongebob-squarepants-truth-or-square/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=27 May 2013|date=10 November 2009}}</ref> He added "All of those amusing moments in ''Truth or Square'', along with the ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' ending, make one forget the patchy Patchy segments in ''Truth or Square''."<ref name=Mavis/> Roy Hrab of [[DVD Verdict]] gave the episode a negative review saying "Wow... This is without a doubt the lamest ''SpongeBob'' episode I have ever seen[...] In fact, nothing interesting happens at all. The Patchy interludes and reliance on cameos merely draws attention to the episode's lack of substance."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hrab|first=Roy|title=Spongebob Squarepants: Truth Or Square|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/truthorsquare.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=27 May 2013|date=20 November 2009}}</ref>
