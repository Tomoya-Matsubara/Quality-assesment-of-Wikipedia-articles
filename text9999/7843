'''''Doe v. Bolton''''', 410 U.S. 179 (1973), was a [[landmark case|landmark]] decision of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] overturning the [[abortion]] law of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  The Supreme Court's decision was released on January 22, 1973, the same day as the decision in the better-known case of ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 U.S. 113 (1973).

==History of case during the 1970s==

The Georgia law in question permitted abortion only in cases of rape, severe fetal deformity, or the possibility of severe or fatal injury to the mother. Other restrictions included the requirement that the procedure be approved in writing by three physicians and by a special committee of the staff of the hospital where the abortion was to be performed. In addition, only Georgia residents could receive abortions under this statutory scheme: non-residents could not have an abortion in Georgia under any circumstances.

The plaintiff, a pregnant woman who was given the pseudonym "Mary Doe" in court papers to protect her identity, sued Arthur K. Bolton, then the Attorney General of Georgia, as the official responsible for enforcing the law.  The anonymous plaintiff has since been identified as [[Sandra Cano]], a 22-year-old mother of three who was nine weeks pregnant at the time the lawsuit was filed.  Cano describes herself as pro-life and claims her attorney, [[Margie Pitts Hames]], lied to her in order to have a plaintiff. <ref>White, Gayle.  [http://poundpuplegacy.org/node/5309 "Roe v. Wade Role Just a Page in Rocky Life Story"], ''The Atlanta Journal and Constitution'' (2003-01-22).</ref>

A three-judge panel of the [[United States district court]]<!--verified as correct, see talk page--> declared the conditional restrictions portion of the law unconstitutional, but upheld the medical approval and residency requirements, and refused to issue an injunction against enforcement of the law. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court under a statute, since repealed, permitting bypass of the circuit appeals court.

The oral arguments and re-arguments followed the same schedule as those in ''Roe''. Atlanta attorney Hames represented Doe at the hearings, while Georgia assistant attorney general Dorothy Toth Beasley represented Bolton.

The same 7-2 majority (Justices [[Byron White|White]] and [[William Rehnquist|Rehnquist]] dissenting) that struck down a [[Texas]] abortion law in ''Roe v. Wade'', invalidated most of the remaining restrictions of the  Georgia abortion law, including the medical approval and residency requirements. Together, ''Doe'' and ''Roe'' declared abortion as a [[United States Constitution|constitutional right]] and by implication overturned most laws against abortion in other [[US state]]s.

===Broad definition of health===<!-- This section is linked from [[Roe v. Wade]] -->

The Court's opinion in ''Doe v. Bolton'' stated that a woman may obtain an abortion after [[Fetus#Viability|viability]], if necessary to protect her health.  The Court defined health as follows:

{{cquote|Whether, in the words of the Georgia statute, "an abortion is necessary" is a professional judgment that the Georgia physician will be called upon to make routinely.  We agree with the District Court, 319 F. Supp., at 1058, that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors - physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age - relevant to the well-being of the patient.  All these factors may relate to health.}}

==Litigation 30 years later==

In 2003, Sandra Cano filed a motion to re-open the case claiming that she had not been aware that the case had been filed on her behalf and that if she had known she would not have supported the litigation.<ref>[http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?hint=2&DR_ID=19558 <U+201C>'Mary Doe' of Doe v. Bolton Files Motion To Overturn Companion Case to Roe v. Wade<U+201D>], ''Kaiser Daily Reproductive Health Report'', (2003-08-27).</ref>  The district court denied her motion, and she appealed.  When the appeals court also denied her motion,<ref>''Cano v.

However, the Supreme Court declined to hear Sandra Cano's suit to overturn the ruling.<ref>Mears, Bill.
