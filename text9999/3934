As the Chief of Mazaris he holds the title of Mir and also goes by the styles of Tumandar and Sardar.  Mir Balakh Sher Mazari is the twenty second Sardar and the seventh Mir of Mazaris.  He has one surviving brother [[Sardar Sherbaz Khan Mazari]] who has played a prominent role in Pakistan politics.

He was born on [[8 July]], [[1928]]{{Fact|date=May 2007}} to [[Mir Murad Buksh Khan Mazari]], the twenty first Sardar and the Sixth Mir of Mazaris.  He accended to the Mazari Chieftaincy in 1933 after the death of his father who only ruled for 3 years.  Mir Murad Buksh Khan Mazari had earlier succeeded his elder brother [[Mir Dost Muhammad Khan Mazari]] as the Chief.  They were the sons of [[Mir Sher Muhammad Khan Mazari]], the Nineteenth Sardar and Fourth Mir of Mazaris.

==Overview of His Life==
Mir Balakh Sher Mazari, after the completion of his education from [[Aitchison College]] in [[1945]] went on to live in [[Rojhan-Mazari]], from where he joined active politics in 1951. He has been elected Member of the Legislative Assembly, Member of the National Assembly and Member of the Provincial Assembly on many occasions. He was [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|caretaker prime minister]] of Pakistan after Nawaz Sharif government was overthrown by [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] , Balakh Sher Mazari's tenure as [[Caretaker Prime Minister]] ended on [[May 26]], [[1993]], when the Supreme Court revoked the Presidential Order and reinstated Nawaz Sharif as the Prime Minister. 

Mir Balakh Sher Mazari;Caretaker Prime Minister

On [[April 18]], [[1993]], the power struggle seemed to be resolved when President Ishaq Khan, exercising the extraordinary constitutional powers afforded the president by the Eighth Amendment, dismissed the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. For the second time, Ghulam Ishaq Khan had invoked the Eighth Amendment to bring down an elected government. The charges of corruption and mismanagement of the economy that he levelled against Nawaz Sharif were almost identical to those he had earlier brought against Benazir Bhutto in 1990. President Ishaq Khan appointed Balakh Sher Mazari as Care Taker Prime Minister for 90 days, a mandatory period to set up a framework for next elections.

In His short lived career as PM his Foreign Policy remained his strong point and probably the only efficient act on his part as Prime Minister was to attend the OIC.

Concerning the struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir the Prime Minister stated that they had been denied their right to self-determination, and called on the OIC to adopt resolute steps to condemn Indian atrocities and violations of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir, and to condemn its continued occupation of that territory. He pointed out that the unending repression had failed to break the will of the Kashmiri people for liberation from India's illegal occupation.

On the question of Palestine, Mr. Mazari stated that Israel must fully implement resolutions 242 and 338 of the U.N. Security Council and that all the Palestinian people be allowed to return to their homeland.

On the genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Mazari stated that Pakistan had sponsored a Security Council resolution imposing additional sanctions on Serbia. He sincerely hoped that the Conference would respond generously to Bosnia-Herzegovina's needs.

Mr. Mazari also called on the OIC to condemn strongly Armenia's attack on Azerbaijan and called for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Azerbaijan and the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

On the issue of Cyprus, the Prime Minister stated that Pakistan supported a bizonal and bicommunal federal structure based on the equality of the Turkish and Greek communities.

Mr. Mazari also called on the Islamic world to support the people of Afghanistan in this period of political transition.

On the issue of terrorism, Mr. Mazari stated that Pakistan is committed to combating international terrorism, and called on the OIC to condemn strongly all forms of terrorism.

The Prime Minister of Pakistan also called on the OIC to protect the rights and welfare of Muslim minorities. He also stated that many OIC states have a stake in combatting racism and xenophobia in Europe, that is affecting Muslims living there.

On [[May 26]], 1993, the Supreme Court voted that Ishaq Khan's dissolution of the National Assembly and his dismissal of the prime minister were unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's action was a sharp rebuke of Ishaq Khan's heavy-handed exercise of presidential powers and was widely hailed as a victory for the advocates of democratization. Yet, although the Supreme Court was able to reinstate the Nawaz Sharif government, the status quo ante was not restored, and the struggle between the president and the prime minister continued unabated, making the pursuit of regular government workings impossible.

==Mazari-Bugti dispute==
This started over the claim of [[Bugti]] tribe on the sand and gravel situated in the Mazari area which was to be used in the construction of 110-kilometre-long piece of [[Indus Highway]] passing through the Mazari area as well. 

Balakh Sher Mazari repeatedly called on the Government for the demarcation of the Punjab-Balochistan border. In the early 1990s a meeting was held in [[Kashmore]], Sindh, with the then Federal Petroleum Minister [[Anwar Saifullah Khan]] in the chair. Punjab Chief Secretary [[Hafeez Akhtar Randhawa]] also attended the meeting as Provincial Home Secretary. The meeting, however, remained inconclusive. 

With the start of work on Indus Highway in 1993 in the area, Turkish and Japanese contractors started paying royalty to the Mazaris for sand and gravel which frustrated the Bugtis and their associates in the Mazari Tribe. The Bugtis started armed assaults in the Punjab. Balakh Sher Mazari complained that so far 37 people, including a senior police official, had been killed in the Bugtis attacks and more than 87 people had either been injured or kidnapped since 1994. In addition, around 20 tractors and several other vehicles had also been snatched from the Mazaris and the people of other clans by the Bugtis. 

He said on the one hand the Rajanpur police had badly failed in checking Bugti intruders in the Punjab, while on the other they had started picking up Mazari notables without giving any reason. The Mazari chief regretted that the [[Government of Balochistan]] was patronizing the Bugtis but the Punjab government was paying no attention to their requests on the grounds that it was infighting between the Baloch tribes.

==Seraiki Belt==
For sometime now he has been advocating that Seraiki areas did not get water as it was promised to them at the time of the construction of [[Chashma Barrage]], CJ and TP link canals and other mega water projects in Punjab on the pretext that there was no water in the system.
He recently posed questions to the government if there was no water for Seraiki and Baloch areas, how come the Greater [[Thal]] Canal was being constructed now? He claims that the GTC was being constructed because retired army officers, higher civilian bureaucrats and some notables have been allotted land in its command area. That will cause another influx into the Seraiki areas.

==Rajanpur District==
The district has three [[tehsil]]s, [[Rajanpur]], [[Jampur]] and [[Rohjhan]]. The district also houses Fazilpur, Mithankot, Omarkot, Murghai, Miranpur, Shahwali, Mominpur, Hajipur, Lalgarh, Noorpur, Bokhara, Dajal, Harrand, Tibi Lundan and Lundi Saidan.

The Mazari tribe is largest in the area followed by the [[Dareshaks]]. The [[Legharis]] of Choti have a strong clout in the district, and have succeeded in winning the district nazim slot in Rajanpur recently in 2003. Apart from this, [[Khosa]]s, [[Khetran]]s, [[Gopang]]s, [[Lund (Tribe)|Lunds]], [[Gorchani]]s, [[Qaiserani]]s and [[Buzdar]]s are also residing in the district. The settlers form around 15-20% of the total population with Rajputs, Arains and Jats in greater proportion. The settlers are generally the supporters of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] and the right-wing parties. Currently, Sardar Balakh Sher Mazari is trying to muster up the settlers' support, besides his own and Gorchanis'.
