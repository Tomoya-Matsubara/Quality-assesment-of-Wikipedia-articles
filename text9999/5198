}}'''Fanno Creek''' is a {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} tributary of the [[Tualatin River]] in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].<ref name="BES">{{cite web | title = Fanno Creek Watershed | publisher = Bureau of Environmental Services, City of Portland | date = 2008 | url = http://www.portlandonline.com/BES/index.cfm?c=dcbjj  | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}</ref> Part of the drainage basin of the [[Columbia River]], its watershed covers  {{convert|32|sqmi|km2|0}} in [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah]], [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington]], and [[Clackamas County, Oregon|Clackamas]] counties, including {{convert|7|sqmi|km2}} within the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] city limits.<ref name="BES"/> 

From its headwaters in the [[Tualatin Mountains]] (West Hills) in southwest Portland, the creek flows generally west and south through the cities of Portland, [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] and [[Durham, Oregon|Durham]], and [[unincorporated area]]s of Washington County. It enters the Tualatin River about {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} above the Tualatin's confluence with the [[Willamette River]] at [[West Linn, Oregon|West Linn]].<ref name="Johnsonstreetmap"/><ref name="Randstreetmap"/><ref name="topomap"/>

For thousands of years, the Atfalati (Tualatin) tribe of the [[Kalapuya]] inhabited the watershed. The first settler of European descent, Augustus Fanno, for whom the creek is named, arrived in the mid-19th&nbsp;century. He established an onion farm in what became Beaverton. [[Augustus Fanno Farmhouse|Fanno Farmhouse]], the restored family home, is a [[Century Farm]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is one of 14&nbsp;urban parks in a narrow corridor along the creek. 

Although heavily polluted, the creek supports aquatic life, including [[cutthroat trout]] in its upper reaches. Watershed councils such as the Friends of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in [[riparian]] zones. 
 
==Course==

Fanno Creek arises at an elevation of {{convert|478|ft|m}} above [[sea level]] and falls {{convert|370|ft|m}} between source and [[mouth (river)|mouth]] to an elevation of {{convert|108|ft|m}}.<ref name="source"/><ref name="gnis"/> The main stem begins at about [[river mile]] (RM)&nbsp;15 or river kilometer (RK)&nbsp;24 in the [[Hillsdale, Portland, Oregon|Hillsdale]] neighborhood of southwest Portland, in Multnomah County. The creek flows west along the north side of [[Oregon Route 10]] (the Beaverton&ndash;Hillsdale Highway), passing Albert Kelly Park and receiving Ivey Creek and Bridlemile Creek on the right before reaching the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) stream gauge at Southwest 56th&nbsp;Avenue {{convert|11.9|mi|km}} from the mouth. Shortly thereafter and in quick succession, it enters [[Washington County, Oregon|Washington County]] and the unincorporated community of [[Raleigh Hills, Oregon|Raleigh Hills]], crosses under Route&nbsp;10, and receives Sylvan Creek on the right. Here the stream turns south, passing through Bauman Park, where Vermont Creek enters on the left about {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the mouth, and then southwest to flow through the Portland Golf Club and Vista Brook Park, where Woods Creek enters on the left. From here it flows west again for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, passing through Fanno Creek Trail Park and entering Beaverton about {{convert|8|mi|km}} from the mouth before turning sharply south and flowing under [[Oregon Route 217]] (Beaverton&ndash;Tigard Highway).<ref name="Johnsonstreetmap"/><ref name="Randstreetmap"/><ref name="topomap"/><ref name="56th Avenue"/>

Fanno Creek then flows roughly parallel to Route&nbsp;217 for about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} through Fanno Creek Park and Greenway Park. Near the southern end of Greenway Park, the creek passes under [[Oregon Route 210]] (Scholls Ferry Road), and enters Tigard about {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} from the mouth. In quick succession, Hiteon Creek enters on the right, Ash Creek on the left, and Summer Creek on the right before the creek reaches Woodard Park, goes under [[Oregon Route 99W]] (Southwest Pacific Highway), and flows through Fanno Park and Bonita Park as well as residential neighborhoods. Between the two parks, Red Rock Creek enters on the left about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} from the mouth. Slightly downstream of Bonita Park, Ball Creek enters on the left. Fanno Creek then enters Durham, passes a USGS gauging station {{convert|1.13|mi|km}} from the mouth, flows through Durham City Park, and empties into the Tualatin River {{convert|9.3|mi|km|}} from its confluence with the Willamette {{nowrap|River.<ref name="Johnsonstreetmap">{{cite map |publisher = G.M.

===Discharge===
The USGS monitors the flow of Fanno Creek at two stations, one in Durham, {{convert|1.13|mi|km}} from the mouth and the other in Portland, {{convert|11.9|mi|km}} from the mouth. The average flow of the creek at the Durham station from a drainage area of {{convert|31.5|sqmi|km2|1}} is {{convert|46|cuft/s|m3/s}}. The maximum flow recorded there was {{convert|1090|cuft/s|m3/s}} on February 6, 1996, and the minimum flow was {{convert|1|cuft/s|m3/s|2}} on September 13, 2001.<ref name="discharge"> Note: The average discharge rate for this location was calculated by adding the average annual discharge rates for the eight calendar years for which data was available and dividing by 8. {{cite web| title=USGS Surface-Water Annual Statistics for the Nation: USGS 14206950 Fanno Creek at Durham, OR| publisher = United States Geological Survey |date = 2008 | url = http://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?site_no=14206950 | accessdate = 2008-05-05 }}</ref> At the Portland station, the average flow from a drainage area of {{convert|2.37|sqmi|km2}} is {{convert|3.26|cuft/s|m3/s|2}}.

==History==
[[Image:Fanno Farmhouse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Augustus Fanno Farmhouse|Fanno Farmhouse]] was the home of Augustus Fanno, for whom the creek is named. Built in 1859 and restored by the Tualatin Hills Park and Recreation District, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.]]The first people of the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the [[Kalapuya]], or "long grass" people, who inhabited large parts of the Willamette Valley for up to 10,000&nbsp;years before the arrival of [[European American]]s. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved from place to place in good weather to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included [[Camassia|camas]] and [[Sagittaria|wapato]]. In addition to fishing for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded for salmon from [[Chinookan]] tribes near [[Willamette Falls]]. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18th&nbsp;century with Europeans, who carried [[smallpox]], [[syphilis]], and [[malaria]]. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000&nbsp;Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the [[Grand Ronde Community|Grande Ronde]] reservation further west.<ref>Tualatin Riverkeepers, pp. 21&ndash;23</ref>
 
Fanno Creek is named after Augustus Fanno, the first European American settler along the creek. In 1847, he started an onion farm on a {{convert|640|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Donation Land Claim Act|donation land claim]] in what later became part of Beaverton. Other 19th&nbsp;century newcomers along the creek engaged mainly in logging, farming, and dairy farming until the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and the [[Oregon Electric Railway]] lines made the watershed more accessible for urban development around the turn of the century. The Oregon Electric, a {{convert|49|mi|km|adj=on}} system built between 1903 and 1915, ran between downtown Portland and [[Garden Home-Whitford, Oregon|Garden Home]] in the Fanno Creek watershed, where it split into branches leading to [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] and [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]]. The Southern Pacific began running electric trains, known as the Red Electric, in the watershed in 1912. The company that eventually became [[Portland General Electric]] installed electric service in the area, and by 1915 the population of the upper Fanno Creek neighborhoods of [[Multnomah, Portland, Oregon|Multnomah]], [[Maplewood, Portland, Oregon|Maplewood]], Hillsdale, and [[West Portland Park, Portland, Oregon|West Portland Park]] had grown to 2,000.<ref name="greenway plan">{{cite web | last = Alta Planning + Design | title = Fanno Creek Greenway Trail Action Plan | publisher = Metro | date = 2003 | url = http://www.metro-region.org/files/planning/fannocreekplan.pdf | format = pdf | accessdaymonth = May 13, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref>

The highways and railroads serve a population that increased most dramatically in the second half of the 20th&nbsp;century. When Beaverton became a city in 1893, it had a population of 400.<ref>{{cite web | title = Beaverton History | publisher = City of Beaverton | date = 2007  | url = http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/history.aspx | accessdaymonth = August 15, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref> In 1960, it still had only 6,000&nbsp;residents, but the number soared to 76,000 by the year&nbsp;2000, although not all of them lived in the watershed.<ref>{{cite web | title = Beaverton Demographic Profiles | publisher = City of Beaverton | date = 2007  | url = http://www.beavertonoregon.gov/community/Census2000/population_housing.aspx | accessdaymonth = August 15, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref> Tigard, which did not exist as a city until 1961,<ref>{{cite web | title = Oregon Bluebook: Tigard | publisher = Oregon State Archives | date = 2008  | url = http://bluebook.state.or.us/local/cities/sy/tigard.htm| accessdaymonth = August 15, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref> grew to 41,000 by the year&nbsp;2000,<ref>{{cite web | title = Population Finder | publisher = U.S. Census Bureau | date = 2008  | url = http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFPopulation?_event=Search&geo_id=01000US&_geoContext=01000US&_street=&_county=tigard&_cityTown=tigard&_state=04000US41&_zip=&_lang=en&_sse=on&ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&_useEV=&pctxt=fph&pgsl=010&_submenuId=population_0&ds_name=null&_ci_nbr=null&qr_name=null&reg=null%3Anull&_keyword=&_industry=| accessdaymonth = August 15, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref>  all in the watershed.<ref name="Tribune"/> The estimated population of the entire watershed  reached 123,000 just before the 2000 census.<ref>{{cite web | last = Inforain: Maps That Matter | title = Fanno Creek | work = Tualatin River Watershed Information System | publisher = Ecotrust | date =1998  | url = http://www.inforain.org/watershed/index.php?full_address=tigard | accessdaymonth = May 7, | accessyear = 2008}}</ref> Fanno Creek, which had few people living near it until 1850, "is surrounded by the most populous region in Oregon".<ref name="Tribune">{{cite web

==Pollution==
Although the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) rated the average water quality of Fanno Creek as "very poor"<ref name="DEQ"/> between 1986 and 1995, it also noted steady improvement over that span. Historically, Fanno Creek has been polluted by urban and industrial sources, small sewage treatment plants, ineffective septic systems, farming and grazing operations, and illegal dumping. Health and environmental concerns led to the closing of substandard wastewater treatment plants in the 1970s, and urban development reduced the number of farms and farm animals along the creek. A ban in 1991 on [[phosphate]] detergents, increased connection to municipal sewers, stormwater management, and greater public awareness helped to reduce urban pollution not coming from [[Point source pollution|point source]]s, and water quality improved.<ref name="DEQ"/> 

DEQ monitors Fanno Creek at Bonita Road in Tigard, at about {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the mouth. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Fanno Creek between 1986 and 1995 was 55 but steadily improved to 65, or "poor",<ref name="DEQ"/> by the end of the period. By comparison, the average in the nearby Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years.<ref name="DEQ">{{cite web | last = Wade | first = Curtis | title = Tualatin Subbasin | work =  Oregon Water Quality Index Report for Lower Willamette, Sandy, and Lower Columbia Basins: Water Years 1986-1995 | publisher = Oregon Department of Environmental Quality | url = http://www.deq.state.or.us/lab/wqm/wqindex/lowillsandy.htm | accessdaymonth = May 17, | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> Measurements of water quality at the Tigard site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of phosphates, [[fecal coliforms|fecal coliform bacteria]], and suspended solids, and a high [[biochemical oxygen demand]]. Moderately high concentrations of [[ammonia]] and [[nitrate]] nitrogen occurred during high flows during fall, winter, and spring. High temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentration in the summer were evidence of [[eutrophication]].<ref name="DEQ"/>

The high fraction of [[impervious surface]]s in the watershed makes it difficult to improve water quality in the creek. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services estimates that one-third of the surface area of the watershed that lies within its jurisdiction is impervious.<ref>{{cite web | title = About the Watershed | publisher = Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, City of Portland | date = 2008 | url = http://www.portlandonline.com/BES/index.cfm?c=33005& | accessdaymonth=September 11, | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> All of the roughly {{convert|12|sqmi|km2}} of the surface of Tigard, much of it impervious, drains into Fanno Creek.<ref name="Tribune"/> The watershed watch coordinator for Tualatin Riverkeepers, a volunteer group, was quoted in a July 2008 newspaper article saying that "the biggest impact to Fanno Creek is the impervious area<U+201D>.<ref name ="Tribune"/> To slow run-off, reduce erosion, and keep pollutants out of streams, watershed councils, neighborhood groups, and government agencies have been planting native species of vegetation at selected sites throughout the watershed.<ref name="Tribune"/>

==Biology==
===Fish and wildlife===
About 100&nbsp;bird species, several kinds of mammals, and a few fish species live in the watershed.
