'''State Route&nbsp;516''' (SR&nbsp;516) is a {{convert|16.49|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], serving communities in southern [[King County, Washington|King County]]. The highway travels east as the Kent-Des Moines Road and the Kent-Kangley Road from a [[Concurrency (road)|concurrency]] with [[Washington State Route 509|SR&nbsp;509]] in [[Des Moines, Washington|Des Moines]] through [[Kent, Washington|Kent]] and [[Covington, Washington|Covington]] to an intersection with [[Washington State Route 169|SR&nbsp;169]] in [[Maple Valley, Washington|Maple Valley]]. SR&nbsp;516, designated as part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]] within Kent, intersects three major freeways in the area: [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate&nbsp;5]] (I-5) in western Kent, [[Washington State Route 167|SR&nbsp;167]] in downtown Kent, and [[Washington State Route 18|SR&nbsp;18]] in [[Covington, Washington|Covington]]. The roadway, built in the 1890s, was codified in 1937 as Secondary State Highway&nbsp;1K (SSH&nbsp;1K) from Des Moines to Kent and SSH&nbsp;5A from Kent to Maple Valley. The two highways were combined during the [[1964 highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]] to form SR&nbsp;516 on its current route.

Every year, the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of [[annual average daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was between SR&nbsp;181 and the SR&nbsp;167 interchange, serving 38,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was its western terminus at SR&nbsp;509, serving 8,900 vehicles.<ref name="ATR">{{citation |author=Staff |year=2011 |title=2011 Annual Traffic Report |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/pdf/Annual_Traffic_Report_2011.pdf |format=PDF |pages=194&ndash;195 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> SR&nbsp;516 between I-5 and SR&nbsp;167 within western Kent is designated as part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name="NHS">{{cite map |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |title=National Highway System: Seattle, WA |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/washington/seattle_wa.pdf |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name="NHS-about">{{citation |title=What is the National Highway System? |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=September 26, 2012 |accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref>

==History==

The Kent-Kangley Road was built as a [[wagon road]] by [[King County, Washington|King County]] by the late 1890s and was upgraded to a paved highway after being codified as two highways during the creation of the [[Primary State Highways (Washington)|primary and secondary state highways system]] in 1937: SSH&nbsp;1K and SSH&nbsp;5A.<ref name="usgs-1900">{{cite map |publisher=United States Geological Survey |title=Washington: Tacoma Quadrangle |date=March 1900 |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/washington/txu-pclmaps-topo-wa-tacoma-1895.jpg |scale=1:250,000 |format=JPG |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}</ref><ref name="law1937">{{citation |author=Washington State Legislature |title=Session Laws of the State of Washington |edition=1937 |series=Session Laws of the State of Washington |date=March 18, 1937 |accessdate=February 24, 2013 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dcQ4AAAAIAAJ |publisher=Washington State Legislature |location=[[Olympia, Washington]] |chapter=Chapter 207: Classification of Public Highways |pages=996, 1002}}</ref> SSH&nbsp;1K traveled {{convert|12.76|mi|km|2}} south from [[U.S. Route 99|U.S. Route&nbsp;99]] and [[Primary State Highway 1 (Washington)|Primary State Highway&nbsp;1]] (PSH&nbsp;1) through [[Burien, Washington|Burien]] and east through [[Des Moines, Washington|Des Moines]] to US&nbsp;99 and PSH&nbsp;1 in [[Midway, Washington|Midway]].
