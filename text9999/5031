In 2014, he was elected to the [[Nebraska Legislature]], representing a  district in the southeastern part of the state.  Baker is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Personal life and professional career==

Baker was born in 1945 in [[York, Nebraska]].  He graduated from high school in [[Benedict, Nebraska|Benedict]] in 1963.  He attended the [[University of Nebraska<U+2013>Lincoln]], receiving a B.S. in education in 1967, an M.Ed. in 1970, and an Ed.D. in 1977.<ref name=legbio/><ref name=linkedin/>

In 1968, Baker married Paula L. Vineyard; the couple eventually produced two children.<ref name=legbio/>

Baker worked as a teacher and a coach in [[Central City, Nebraska|Central City]] from 1968 to 1970.  From 1970 to 1972, he taught, coached, and served as principal in [[Marquette, Nebraska|Marquette]].  In 1972, he returned to his hometown of Benedict; there, he served as principal from 1972 to 1974, and then as superintendent of schools from 1974 to 1977.<ref name=linkedin/><ref name=bps/>

In 1977, he moved to [[Arlington, Nebraska|Arlington]], where he served as superintendent of schools for eleven years.  He moved to [[Harlan, Iowa]] in 1988, and held the position of superintendent of Harlan Community School District for nine years.  In 1997, he returned to Nebraska to take up the post of superintendent at [[Norris School District 160]], which covers portions of southern [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]], northern [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]], and western [[Otoe County, Nebraska|Otoe County]].<ref name=linkedin/><ref name=bps/><ref name=norris/>

In May 2004, a large [[2004 Hallam, Nebraska tornado|tornado]] destroyed the village of [[Hallam, Nebraska|Hallam]] and then struck the Norris campus, causing $35 million in damage to the school.<ref name=norris-hist/><ref name=rebuild/>  Baker took charge of reconstruction efforts, declaring "In an extreme crisis such as this, authoritarian leadership is not only OK, it is most appropriate."<ref name=award/>  By expediting contracting and construction, and through the use of portable classrooms, the school was able to re-open for the fall semester shortly after [[Labor Day]].  For his efforts, Baker was named Superintendent of the Year by the Nebraska Council of School Administrators.<ref name=rebuild/><ref name=award/><ref name=retiring/>

Baker remained at Norris until 2010, when he retired.<ref name=firstweek/>  In that year, he co-founded Baker & Rastovski School Services, a consulting firm assisting schools in Nebraska to find, hire, and train administrators.<ref name=consultants/>  In October 2012, following the death of the superintendent of Beatrice Public Schools, he was hired as interim superintendent for the remainder of the 2012<U+2013>2013 school year.<ref name=hire/>

==Political career==
===2014 election===

In September 2013, Baker announced that he would run for the Nebraska Legislature from District 30.  The district, consisting of [[Gage County, Nebraska|Gage County]] and part of southern [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]], included the cities of [[Beatrice, Nebraska|Beatrice]] and [[Wymore, Nebraska|Wymore]], and portions of southern and western [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]].  Incumbent [[Norm Wallman]], a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was barred by Nebraska's [[Term limit|term-limits]] law from running for a third consecutive term.<ref name=sun/><ref name=retired/><ref name=district30/><ref name=diverge/><ref name=third/>

A second candidate, like Baker a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]],<ref name=diverge/> joined the race in February 2014.  Bob Tiemann, the owner of a Beatrice construction firm,<ref name=tiemann-torun/> had sought the District 30 seat twice before.  In 1982,<ref name=ljs-error/> he had come in last in a three-way primary, with 16.6% of the vote;<ref name=primary-1982/> in the 2010 primary election, he had again placed third of three, this time with 26.2% of the vote.<ref name=primary-2010/>

In the nonpartisan primary election, Tiemann received 3720 of the 7167 votes cast, or 51.9% of the total.  Baker obtained 3447 votes, or 48.1%.<ref name=primary-2014/>

====2014 general election====

Since only two candidates had run in the primary, both moved on to the general election.  Baker declared "I don't breathe partisan fire",<ref name=statesman/> and stated that the Nebraska legislature was "officially nonpartisan, and I think it ought to stay that way".<ref name=diverge/>  Tiemann stated that the district needed to elect a businessman who knew how to budget, and that a Gage County resident would better represent the district; Baker asserted that he had learned to manage on a limited budget as a school superintendent, and that he would be one of the few legislators who understood Nebraska's state-aid-to-schools formula.<ref name=diverge/>

On specific issues, Baker supported the proposed expansion of [[Medicaid]] in Nebraska under the provisions of the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]]; Tiemann was inclined to oppose the expansion, lest the federal government renege on its pledge to reimburse states for the increased costs.<ref name=diverge/>  Baker supported retaining a state law offering in-state tuition rates to persons who were residing illegally in the United States after being brought into the country as children, and who were granted an exemption from deportation under the [[Barack Obama]] administration's [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program; Tiemann opposed this tuition policy.<ref name=diverge/>  Tiemann favored retaining the state's policy of denying driver's licenses to DACA beneficiaries; Baker opposed the policy.<ref name=diverge/>  Both candidates supported capital punishment, with reservations;<ref name=forum/> both supported a ballot measure to increase the state's minimum wage.<ref name=forum/>

Over the course of the whole campaign, Baker raised over $46,000 and spent over $50,000.  Major contributors included the Nebraska State Education Association, which furnished $9,000; the Nebraska Hospital Association, which contributed $5,000; and the Associated General Contractors Highway Improvement PAC, which supplied $4,000.<ref name=money-baker/>  Tiemann raised almost $30,000 and spent the same.  His major institutional contributors included the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which supplied over $5,000, and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, which furnished $1,000; the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, which contributed over $4,000; and the Nebraska Realtors, which provided $3,000.  Tiemann also received $2,500 from Republican gubernatorial candidate [[Pete Ricketts]].<ref name=money-tiemann/>  The Nebraska Bankers Association gave $2,500 to each campaign.<ref name=money-baker/><ref name=money-tiemann/>

When the general election was held in November 2014, Baker received 6565 of the 11,712 votes cast, or 56.1% of the total.  Tiemann obtained 5147 votes, or 43.9%.<ref name=general-2014/>

===Legislative tenure===

In the 2015 session of the legislature, Baker was appointed to the Education Committee and the Health and Human Services Committee.  He was one of three legislators named to represent Nebraska in the interstate [[Education Commission of the States]].<ref name=committees/>
