==Biography==

Her father worked for a court [[Peshwa]] of [[Bithoor district]] who brought Manikarnika up like his own daughter.

She was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included archery, horsemanship, and self-defence.{{cn|date=October 2012}} 

Manikarnika was married to the [[Maharaja]] of Jhansi, Raja Gangadhar Rao, in 1842,<ref>Meyer, Karl E. & Brysac, Shareen Blair (1999) ''[[Great Game|Tournament of Shadows]]''. Washington, DC: Counterpoint; p. 138--"The Rani of Jhansi ... known to history as Lakshmi Bai, she was possibly only twelve in 1842 when she married the ..

The Raja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before he died. The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the raja requesting that the child should be treated with kindness and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime. After the death of the raja in November 1853 because Damodar Rao was adopted, the [[British East India Company]], under Governor-General [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], applied the [[Doctrine of Lapse]], rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. In March 1854, Lakshmibai was given a pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, pp. 113-14</ref>

=== Indian Rebellion of 1857-58 ===
====May - July 1857 ====
A [[rumour]] that the cartridges supplied by the East India Company to the soldiers in its army contained pork or beef fat began to spread throughout India in the early months of 1857.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, pp. 22-23</ref> On May 10, 1857 the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian Rebellion]] started in [[Meerut]]; when news of this reached Jhansi the Rani asked the British political officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for her own protection and Skene agreed to this.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 115</ref> The city was relatively calm in the midst of unrest in the region but the Rani conducted a [[Haldi Kumkum]] ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide assurance to her subjects,{{when|date=October 2012}} and to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of them.<ref>David E. Jones, ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=AEF6t0wDRKQC Women Warriors: a History]'' (Brassey<U+2019>s, 2005), p. 46.</ref><ref>Vishnubhat Godse ''Maja Pravas''</ref>

Till this point, Lakshmibai was reluctant to rebel against the British. In June 1857 a few men of the 12th Native Infantry seized the fort containing the treasure and magazine, and massacred the European officers of the garrison along with their wives and children. (Her forces did not kill any East India Company officials and their wives and children in Jokhan Bagh on 8 June 1857 but she was subsequently accused by the British of that.<ref name="Jerosch">''[http://books.google.com/books?id=N-KpcaLP8VgC Rani of Jhansi, Rebel against will]'' by Rainer Jerosch, published by Aakar Books 2007, chapters 5 and 6</ref>) An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the rebellion characterizing her as the "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".<ref>Lowe, Thomas (1860) ''Central India during the Rebellion'', cited in Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 117</ref> Four days after the massacre the sepoys left Jhansi having obtained a large sum of money from the Rani, and having threatened to blow up the palace where she lived. Following this as the only source of authority in the city the Rani felt obliged to assume the administration and wrote to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor division explaining the events which had led her to do so.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 118</ref> On July 2 Erskine wrote in reply that he requested her to "manage the District for the British Government" until the arrival of a British Superintendent.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 119</ref> The Rani's forces defeated an attempt by the mutineers to assert the claim to the throne of a rival prince who was captured and imprisoned. There was then an invasion of Jhansi by the forces of [[Orchha State|Orchha]] and [[Datia]] (allies of the British); their intention however was to divide Jhansi between them. The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed that she was responsible for the massacre and no reply was received. She set up a foundry to cast cannon (to be used on the walls of the fort) and assembled forces including some from former feudatories of Jhansi and elements of the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in August 1857. Her intention at this time was still to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 117</ref>

====August 1857 - June 1858====
From August 1857 to January 1858 Jhansi under the Rani's rule was at peace. The British had announced that troops would be sent there to maintain control but the fact that none arrived strengthened the position of a party of her advisers who wanted independence from British rule. When the British forces finally arrived in March they found it well defended and the fort had heavy guns which could fire over the town and nearby countryside. Sir Hugh Rose, commanding the British forces, demanded the surrender of the city; if this was refused it would be destroyed.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, pp. 117-19</ref> After due deliberation the Rani issued a proclamation: "We fight for independence. In the words of Lord Krishna, we will if we are victorious, enjoy the fruits of victory, if defeated and killed on the field of battle, we shall surely earn eternal glory and salvation."<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 119, citing [[Vishnubhat Godse]] ''Majha Pravas'', Poona, 1948, in Marathi; p. 67</ref> She defended Jhansi against British troops when [[Hugh Rose, 1st Baron Strathnairn|Sir Hugh Rose]] besieged Jhansi on 23 March 1858.[[Image:1857 jhansi fort2.jpg|thumb|[[Jhansi Fort]], 1882]] The bombardment began on 24 March but was met by heavy return fire and the damaged defences were repaired. The defenders sent appeals for help to Tatya Tope.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 119</ref> An army of more than 20,000, headed by [[Tatya Tope]], was sent to relieve Jhansi but they failed to do so when they fought the British on 31 March. During the battle with Tatya Tope's forces part of the British forces continued the siege and by 2 April it was decided to launch an assault by a breach in the walls. Four columns assaulted the defences at different points and those attempting to scale the walls came under heavy fire. Two other columns had already entered the city and were approaching the palace together. Determined resistance was encountered in every street and in every room of the palace. Street fighting continued into the following day and no quarter was given, even to women and children. "No maudlin clemency was to mark the fall of the city" wrote Thomas Lowe.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, pp. 120-21</ref> The Rani withdrew from the palace to the fort and after taking counsel decided that since resistance in the city was useless she must leave and join either Tatya Tope or Rao Sahib (Nana Sahib's nephew).<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 121</ref> [[File:The place from where Rani Lakshmibai jumped.jpg|thumb|The place from where Rani Lakshmibai jumped on her horse, Badal]] According to tradition with Damodar Rao on her back she jumped on her horse Badal from the fort; they survived but the horse died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remarkableindia.com/jhansi.php|title=Jhansi|publisher=Remarkable India|accessdate=27 October 2012}}</ref> The Rani escaped in the night with her son, surrounded by guards.<ref name="Jerosch"/>

She decamped to [[Kalpi]] with a few guards, where she joined additional rebel forces, including [[Tatya Tope]].<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, p. 121</ref> They occupied the town of Kalpi and prepared to defend it. On 22 May British forces attacked Kalpi; the Indian forces were commanded by the Rani herself and were again defeated. The leaders (the Rani of Jhansi, Tatya Tope, the Nawab of [[Banda]], and Rao Sahib) fled once more. They came to Gwalior and joined the Indian forces who now held the city (Maharaja Scindia having fled to Agra from the battlefield at Morar). They moved on to [[Gwalior state|Gwalior]] intending to occupy the strategic [[Gwalior Fort]] and the rebel forces occupied the city without opposition. The rebels proclaimed Nana Sahib as Peshwa of a revived Maratha dominion with Rao Sahib as his governor in Gwalior. The Rani was unsuccessful in trying to persuade the other rebel leaders to prepare to defend Gwalior against a British attack which she expected would come soon. General Rose's forces took [[Gwalior#Morar|Morar]] on 16 June and then made a successful attack on the city.<ref>Edwardes, Michael (1975) ''Red Year''. London: Sphere Books, pp. 124-25</ref> On 17 June in Kotah-ki-Serai {{Coord|26|12|44.26|N|78|10|24.76|E|display=inline}} near the [[Gwalior Fort|Phool Bagh]] of Gwalior, a squadron of the [[8th King's Royal Irish Hussars|8th (King's Royal Irish) Hussars]], under [[Clement Walker Heneage|Captain Heneage]], fought the large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai which was trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the Indian force, killing many Indian soldiers, taking two guns and continuing the charge right through the Phool Bagh encampment. In this engagement, according to an eyewitness account, Rani Lakshmibai put on a sowar's uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed, fired at him with a pistol, and also wounded, probably by his sabre, then died from a rifleshot.<ref>David (2006), pp. 351-352</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Allen Copsey |url=http://www.copsey-family.org/~allenc/lakshmibai/smith-gwalior.html |title=Brigadier M W Smith Jun 25th 1858 to Gen. Hugh Rose |publisher=Copsey-family.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>  According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a cavalry leader, was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture her body, she told a hermit to burn it. After her death a few local people cremated her body. The British captured the city of [[Gwalior]] after three days. In the British report of this battle, Hugh Rose commented that Rani Lakshmibai is "personable, clever and beautiful" and she is "the most dangerous of all Indian leaders".<ref>David, Saul (2003), ''The Indian Mutiny: 1857'', London: Penguin; p. 367</ref><ref>Ashcroft, Nigel (2009), ''Queen of Jhansi'', Mumbai: Hollywood Publishing; p. 1</ref> Rose reported that she had been buried "with great ceremony under a tamarind tree under the Rock of Gwalior, where I saw her bones and ashes".<ref>Meyer ''Tournament''; p. 145</ref> Her tomb is in the Phool Bagh area of Gwalior.
