'''Patto Segni''' (Segni Pact, PS) was a [[Christian democracy|Christian-democratic]] and [[liberalism|liberal]] [[List of political parties in Italy|political party in Italy]], named after [[Mario Segni]].

==History==
The party was founded in 1993 as a split from [[Democratic Alliance (Italy)|Democratic Alliance]] and as the continuation of the [[Populars for the Reform]], a split from [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] in 1992, whose principal aim was electoral reform from [[proportional representation]] to a [[plurality voting system]].

The party contested the [[Italian general election, 1994|1994 general election]] within the [[Pact for Italy]] coalition, along with the [[Italian People's Party (1994<U+2013>2002)|Italian People's Party]] and with Mario Segni as candidate for Prime Minister. The PS included in its lists [[Italian Republican Party|Republicans]] ([[Giorgio La Malfa]], [[Alberto Zorzoli]], [[Vittorio Dotti]], [[Danilo Poggiolini]] and [[Carla Mazzuca]]), [[Italian Liberal Party|Liberals]] ([[Valerio Zanone]], [[Pietro Milio]] and [[Luigi Compagna]]), [[Italian Socialist Party|Socialists]] ([[Giuliano Amato]], [[Giulio Tremonti]] and [[Claudio Nicolini]]), [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party|Democratic Socialists]] ([[Enrico Ferri]] and [[Gian Franco Schietroma]]) and several former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] (Mario Segni himself, [[Gianni Rivera]], [[Alberto Michelini]], [[Elisabetta Gardini]], [[Michele Cossa]], [[Livio Filippi]], [[Vincenzo Viola]], etc.).  

The PS won 4.7% of the vote and 13 deputies, but soon after the election it split in many factions. The group around Alberto Michelini and Giulio Tremonti, for instance, founded the [[Liberal Democratic Foundation]] and decided to support [[Berlusconi I Cabinet]] (Tremonti even became Finance Minister); by the 1996 they had joined [[Forza Italia]].

In the 1995 regional elections the PS formed a list named [[Pact of Democrats]], along with the [[Italian Socialists]] and Democratic Alliance, gaining mixed results and in November to Florence [[Gian Piero Ventura]], secretary of the youthful group, it has founded the movement <U+201C>Young People for [[The Olive Tree]]<U+201D> with [[Romano Prodi]] e [[Walter Veltroni]]. In the [[Italian general election, 1996|1996 general election]] the party was part of [[Italian Renewal]] and got only five deputies elected ([[Giuseppe Biccocchi]], [[Diego Masi]], [[Elisa Pozza Tasca]], Gianni Rivera, [[Ernesto Stajano]] and one senator [[Carla Mazzuca]]), within [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|The Olive Tree]] centre-left coalition.

In 1999, after having contributed to the foundation of the [[Democratic Union for the Republic]] with [[Francesco Cossiga]] and [[Clemente Mastella]], the PS attracted some former [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radicals]] from Forza Italia ([[Marco Taradash]] and [[Giuseppe Calderisi]]), while others left the party to join [[The Democrats (Italy)|The Democrats]] (Elisa Pozza Tasca, Danilo Poggiolini, Carla Mazzuca, Livio Filippi and Vincenzo Viola). In the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Italy)|1999 European Parliament election]] the party formed a joint list with [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] and Segni was re-elected [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]].

In 2001 the PS decided not to present lists for the [[Italian general election, 2001|general election]], but Michele Cossa, member of the [[Sardinian Reformers]], the regional section of the party in [[Sardinia]], was elected deputy in a single-seat constituency of [[Cagliari]] for the [[House of Freedoms]] centre-right coalition.

In 2003 the party was finally transformed into the [[Pact of Liberal Democrats]].
