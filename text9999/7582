'''John Samuel "Jocko" Thompson''' (January 17, 1917 <U+2013> February 3, 1988) was a [[pitcher]] for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] of [[Major League Baseball]] from 1948 to 1951. He also served in the [[Army of the United States]] as a [[first lieutenant]] in the [[European Theatre of World War II|European theater]] during [[World War II]]. Thompson played in Major League Baseball for four years during the [[Whiz Kids (baseball)|Whiz Kids]] era during a career which spanned 12 seasons (1940<U+2013>1941, 1946<U+2013>1955).

After attending [[Northeastern University]], Thompson entered the military and participated in [[Operation Market Garden]], where he led a platoon to secure a bridge over the [[Meuse (river)|Maas River]]. He served in the Army from 1941 to 1945. In 2004, the bridge which his platoon captured was re-named in his honor.<ref name="BIW"/>

Thompson appeared as a [[Pitcher#Rotation and specialization|situational pitcher]] and [[spot starter]] during the 1948, 1949, and 1950 seasons with the Phillies, and went 4<U+2013>8 in his only season as a regular member of the team's [[starting rotation]]. After demotion to the minors in 1952, Thompson retired from baseball after the 1955 season.<ref name="brefminors"/>

Thompson led his platoon in an attack against the nearby bridge spanning the [[Meuse (river)|Maas River]], which was defended by German forces supplemented by two 20 mm [[flak gun]]s, one on the close side of the bridge and one across the river.
