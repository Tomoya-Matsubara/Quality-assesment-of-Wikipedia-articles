Speaking of his casting, Proud said he is "delighted and honoured to be joining such a talented cast [and] very excited and looking forward to bringing the character to life."<ref name="digitalspy"/> The show's executive producer, [[Diederick Santer]], said it was "about time" the show cast an adult actor with a disability: "In recent years, we've had a number of regular and guest characters with disabilities, some of them children like [[Janet Mitchell]] and more recently [[Syd Chambers|Syd]]'s son, [[Noah Chambers|Noah]]. We've also told the story of [[Jean Slater]] who suffers from [[bipolar disorder]]. But this is the first time we've had a regular adult character with a visible disability played by an actor with a disability. It's about time."<ref name="digitalspy"/> Santer added that the character would be "interesting, but possibly irritating".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8084188.stm|title=Disabled character for EastEnders |publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=4 June 2009|accessdate=5 June 2009}}</ref>

It is said that the character will form a low opinion of his mother's partner [[Minty Peterson]] (played by [[Cliff Parisi]]) and will fall for [[Libby Fox]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]), the girlfriend of [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]).<ref name="digitalspy"/><ref name="guardian"/>
