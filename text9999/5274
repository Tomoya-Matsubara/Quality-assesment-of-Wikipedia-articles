'''George Harrison''',{{refn|group=nb|Some published sources give Harold as Harrison's middle name.<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Giuliano|Giuliano|1998|p=246}}</ref> Others dispute that, based on the absence of any middle name on his birth certificate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shawstar.com/music/george_harrison.htm |title=George Harrison biography |publisher=Shawstar.com |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>}} {{post-nominals|MBE|size=100%}} (25 February 1943&nbsp;<U+2013> 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer, and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. [[Lennon<U+2013>McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]] were the band's primary songwriters, but most of their albums included at least one Harrison composition, including "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" and "[[Something]]", the Beatles' second [[cover version|most-covered]] song.

Harrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]], [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]; [[Chet Atkins]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Ry Cooder]] were significant later influences. By 1965 Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[the Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]". He became interested in the [[Hare Krishna movement]] and an admirer of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and mysticism, introducing them to the other Beatles and their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Following [[The Beatles' break-up|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', from which two hit singles originated. He also organized the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor for later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. Harrison was a music and film producer as well as a musician; he founded [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founded [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.

Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer, and in 1988 co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Bob Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time".

Harrison's first marriage, to [[Pattie Boyd]], ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Trinidad Arias]], with whom he had one son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died in 2001, aged 58, from lung cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India, in a private ceremony according to [[Ganges in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]]. He left almost <U+00A3>100 million in his will.

Born in [[Liverpool]], Lancashire, England, on 25 February 1943, Harrison was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise (n<U+00E9>e French).{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=6}} He had one sister, Louise, and two brothers, Harry and Peter.{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=492}} His mother was a shop assistant from a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family with Irish roots, and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship's steward on the [[White Star Line]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2000|p=492}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=24}}.</ref> His future wife, model Pattie Boyd, described Harrison's parents as "quite short and very Liverpudlian".{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=82}} According to Boyd, Harrison's mother was particularly supportive: "All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy, and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music."{{sfn|Boyd|2007|p=82}} An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=120}} While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast, Radio India. Harrison biographer Joshua Greene wrote: "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and [[tabla]]s, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb."{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=2}}

Harrison was born and lived for the first six years of his life at [[12 Arnold Grove]], [[Wavertree]], Liverpool, in a [[terraced house]] in a [[cul-de-sac]].{{sfn|Harrison|2002|pp=20<U+2013>21}} The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire.

Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby, [[Cab Calloway]], [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Hoagy Carmichael]], and [[Big Bill Broonzy]]. In early 1956 he had an epiphany; while riding his bicycle, he heard [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]" playing from a nearby house, and the song piqued his interest in [[rock and roll]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/nov/30/guardianobituaries1 |title=George Harrison, 1943<U+2013>2001: Former Beatle George Harrison dies from cancer aged 58 |last=Laing |first=Dave |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 November 2001 |accessdate=25 December 2012}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|pp=302<U+2013>304}}: Harrison's earliest musical influences.</ref> He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks; he commented: "I was totally into guitars".{{sfn|Lange|2001|p=6}}

In March 1958 Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at [[Rory Storm]]'s Morgue Skiffle Club, playing "[[Guitar Boogie (song)|Guitar Boogie Shuffle]]", but Lennon felt that Harrison, then 14, was too young to join the band.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=125<U+2013>126}} During a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental "[[Raunchy (song)|Raunchy]]" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=127}} Soon after he began socializing with the group, filling in on guitar as needed,{{sfn|Davies|2009|pp=44<U+2013>45}} and by the time he turned 15 they had accepted him as a member.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}} Although his father wanted him to continue his education, Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at [[Blacklers]], a local department store.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyd|2007|p=82}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Davies|2009|p=55}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=29}}: (primary source).</ref>

In 1960 [[Allan Williams]] arranged for the band, now calling themselves the Beatles, to play at the [[Kaiserkeller]] club in [[Hamburg]], owned by [[Bruno Koschmider]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=57<U+2013>58}} The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles, as well as the guitar lessons he took from [[Tony Sheridan]] while they briefly served as his backing group, laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet, professional role within the group; he was later known as "the quiet Beatle".<ref>{{harvnb|Leng|2006|pp=2<U+2013>6}}; {{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1432634.stm |title=George Harrison: The quiet Beatle |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=1 January 2013 |date=30 November 2001}}.</ref> The band's first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=27}} When [[Brian Epstein]] became their manager in December 1961, he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with [[EMI]].<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=59}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=84<U+2013>88}}.</ref> The group's first single, "[[Love Me Do]]", peaked at number seventeen on the ''[[Record Retailer]]'' chart, and by the time their debut album, ''[[Please Please Me]]'' was released in early 1963, [[Beatlemania]] had arrived.<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=34}}; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=59<U+2013>60}}.</ref> Their second album, ''[[With the Beatles]]'' (1963), included "[[Don't Bother Me]]", Harrison's first solo writing credit.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=193}}

By 1965's ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Unterberger|2002|pp=180<U+2013>181}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Everett|2001|pp=313<U+2013>315}}.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Harrison also contributed the songs "[[If I Needed Someone]]" and "[[Think for Yourself]]" to ''Rubber Soul''.{{sfn|Womack|2007|pp=124<U+2013>125}}}} He later called ''Rubber Soul'' his "favourite [Beatles] album".{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=194}} ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) included three of his compositions: "[[Taxman]]", "[[Love You To]]" and "[[I Want to Tell You]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1980|pp=75<U+2013>78}}.</ref> His introduction of the drone-like [[Tanpura (instrument)|tambura]] part on Lennon's "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" exemplified the band's ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=35<U+2013>36}} The [[tabla]]-driven "Love You To" was the Beatles' first genuine foray into Indian music.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=40<U+2013>42}} According to [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]] David Reck, the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody.<ref>{{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=22}}: (secondary source); {{cite journal |last=Reck |first=D.

By late 1966 Harrison's interests had moved away from the Beatles, as reflected in his choice of Eastern [[guru]]s and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for ''[[Sgt.

Dylan and [[the Band]] were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=52}} He established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, in contrast with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and his growing desire to assert his independence from the band.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=39<U+2013>52}} During the recording of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' in 1968, tensions ran high, with drummer [[Ringo Starr]] briefly quitting.{{sfn|Babiuk|2002|p=217}} Harrison's songwriting contributions to the album included "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]", which featured [[Eric Clapton]] on lead guitar, "[[Piggies]]", "[[Long, Long, Long]]", and "[[Savoy Truffle]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=200<U+2013>202}}: "While My Guitar Gently Weeps"; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|p=254}}: "Long, Long, Long"; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|p=329}}: "Savoy Truffle";  {{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=110}}: "Piggies".</ref> Tensions among the Beatles surfaced again during the filming of rehearsals at [[Twickenham Studios]] in January 1969 for what became the album ''[[Let It Be]]''.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=39<U+2013>52}} Frustrated by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio, as well as by what he perceived as Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison left the band on 10 January.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=60<U+2013>61}} Following negotiations with the band, he agreed to return twelve days later.{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=248}}

Relations among the Beatles were more cordial, though still strained, during sessions for ''[[Abbey Road]]'', their final recorded album.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=354}} The LP included two of Harrison's most respected Beatles compositions: "Here Comes the Sun" and "[[Something]]", which became one half of the Beatles' first [[A-side and B-side|double-sided]] number one single, Harrison's first A-side, and his first chart topper.<ref>{{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=576}}; {{harvnb|Bronson|1992|p=262}}.</ref> In 1969, [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded "Something", and later dubbed it "the greatest love song of the past fifty years".{{sfn|Fricke|2002|p=178}} Lennon considered it the best song on ''Abbey Road'', and it became the Beatles' second most covered song after "[[Yesterday]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Spignesi|Lewis|2009|p=97}}: "Something" is the Beatles' second most covered song after "Yesterday"; {{harvnb|Gilmore|2002|p=39}}: Lennon considered "Something" the best song on ''Abbey Road''.</ref> By 1969, Harrison had matched Lennon and McCartney's songwriting abilities. Author Peter Lavezzoli wrote: "Harrison would finally achieve equal songwriting status&nbsp;... with his two classic contributions to the final Beatles' LP".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=185}}

In April 1970 when Harrison's "[[For You Blue]]" was released in America as a double A-side with McCartney's "[[The Long and Winding Road]]", it became the band's second chart-topping double A-side and "For You Blue" became Harrison's second number one hit.{{sfn|Bronson|1992|p=275}} His increased productivity and the Beatles' reluctance to include his songs on their albums meant that by the time of [[Break-up of the Beatles|their break-up]] he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=36<U+2013>37}} While Harrison grew as a songwriter, his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs, increasing his frustration, and significantly contributing to the band's [[Break-up of the Beatles|break-up]].{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=413}} Harrison's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970, when he, McCartney and Starr recorded the Harrison song "[[I Me Mine]]".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=195}}

==Solo career: 1968<U+2013>87==

===Early solo work===
Before the Beatles' break-up Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums: ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' and ''[[Electronic Sound]]'', both of which include mainly instrumental compositions.

In December 1969 Harrison joined the American group [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]] for a brief tour of Europe.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=63<U+2013>65}} During the tour that included Clapton, [[Bobby Whitlock]], drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]] and band leaders [[Delaney Bramlett|Delaney]] and [[Bonnie Bramlett]], Harrison began to write  "[[My Sweet Lord]]", which became his first single as a solo artist.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=67}} Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar, significantly influencing his later music.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=64, 84}}

In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really.

===The Concert for Bangladesh===
{{Main|The Concert for Bangladesh}}
Responding to a request from Ravi Shankar, Harrison organized a charity event, the Concert for Bangladesh, which took place on 1 August 1971, drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="ConcertforBangladesh">{{cite web|url=http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/|title=Concert for Bangladesh|publisher=Concertforbangladesh|accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref> The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=132<U+2013>136}} Shankar opened the show, along with fellow Indian musicians [[Ali Akbar Khan]] and [[Alla Rakha]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=132<U+2013>136}} The concert featured popular musicians such as Dylan, who rarely appeared live in the early 1970s, Clapton, [[Leon Russell]], Badfinger, Preston and Starr. A triple album, ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (album)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]'', was released by [[Apple Corps]] that year, followed by a [[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|concert film]] in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation&nbsp;... The money we raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems&nbsp;... they still got plenty&nbsp;... even though it was a drop in the ocean.

===''Living in the Material World'' to ''George Harrison''===
''[[Living in the Material World]]'' (1973) held the number one spot on the ''Billboard'' album chart for five weeks, and the album's single, "[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]", also reached number one in the US.<ref>{{harvnb|Bronson|1992|p=336}}: Peak US chart position for "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)"; {{harvnb|Rosen|1996|p=162}}: US chart data on ''Living in the Material World''.</ref> In the UK, the LP achieved number two, spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=227}} The album was lavishly produced and packaged, and its dominant message was Harrison's Hindu beliefs.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=158<U+2013>159}} In Greene's opinion it "contained many of the strongest compositions of his career".{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=194}} ''Rolling Stone''{{'s}} [[Stephen Holden]] declared the album "vastly appealing" and "profoundly seductive&nbsp;... [it] stands alone as an article of faith, miraculous in its radiance."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=195}} Other reviewers were less enthusiastic, describing the release as awkward, sanctimonious and overly sentimental, a reaction that left Harrison despondent.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=43, 46}}

In November 1974 Harrison began his a 45-date Dark Horse Tour, becoming the first ex-Beatle to tour North America.{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=166, 195}} In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Preston, [[Tom Scott]], [[Willie Weeks]], [[Andy Newmark]] and [[Jim Horn]], the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by "Ravi Shankar, Family and Friends".<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|2010|pp=48<U+2013>49}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=167}}.</ref> Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative, with complaints about the content, structure, and length; the show's duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=224<U+2013>228}}; {{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=213}}; {{harvnb|Huntley|2006|p=115}}; {{harvnb|Inglis|2010|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=162}}: "an excellent show"; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|pp=114<U+2013>115}}.</ref> Some fans found Shankar's significant presence a bizarre disappointment, having expected to see only Harrison perform, and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison's "sermonizing".{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} Further, he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs, and some of the substitutions were seen as "gratuitously offensive".{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} His [[laryngitis]]-affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics, who began calling the tour "dark hoarse".<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|pp=213<U+2013>214}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=224<U+2013>226}}.</ref> He was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that he did not tour again until the 1990s.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=49}} Author Robert Rodriguez commented: "While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure, there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted. They went away ecstatic, conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated."{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=258}} Leng called the tour "groundbreaking" and "revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music".{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=173, 177}}

In December he released ''[[Dark Horse (George Harrison album)|Dark Horse]]'', an album that earned Harrison the least favourable reviews of his career.{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=213}} ''Rolling Stone'' called it "the chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new 'LP product', rehearse a band, and assemble a cross-country tour, all within three weeks."{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=114}} The album reached number 4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart and the single "[[Dark Horse (song)|Dark Horse]]" reached number 15, but they failed to make an impact in the UK.<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=213}}: failed to reach the UK top 30; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=142<U+2013>143}}: Peak US chart positions, failure to impact UK charts.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|In December 1974 the single, "[[Ding Dong, Ding Dong]]", reached number 38 in the UK.{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=227}}}} Music critic [[Mikal Gilmore]] described ''Dark Horse'' as "one of Harrison's most fascinating works <U+2013> a record about change and loss".{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=46}} 

Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was the [[soul music]]-inspired ''[[Extra Texture (Read All About It)]]'' (1975).{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=180}} He considered it the least satisfactory of the three he had recorded since ''All Things Must Pass''.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=54<U+2013>55}} Leng identified "bitterness and dismay" in many of the album's tracks; long-time Harrison friend Klaus Voormann commented: "He wasn't up for it&nbsp;... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture&nbsp;... I didn't like his frame of mind".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=179}} He released two singles from the LP: "[[You (George Harrison song)|You]]", which reached the ''Billboard'' top 20, and "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)]]", Apple's final original single release.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|pp=209<U+2013>210}} 

''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' (1976), Harrison's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label, produced the hit singles "[[This Song]]" and "[[Crackerbox Palace]]", both of which reached the top 25 in the US.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=187}}{{refn|group=nb|Released during the same month, ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' (1976) combined several of his Beatles songs with a selection of his solo Apple work.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=28<U+2013>29}} Following Harrison's departure from the label, Capitol could license releases featuring Beatles and post-Beatles work on the same album.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=188}}}} The [[surreal humour]] of "Crackerbox Palace" reflected Harrison's association with [[Monty Python]]'s [[Eric Idle]], who directed a comical music video for the song.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=192}} With an emphasis on melody and musicianship, and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works, ''Thirty Three & 1/3'' earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since ''All Things Must Pass''.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=192}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] provided production assistance on "Thirty Three & 1/3".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=187}} In November 1976, Harrison appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with [[Paul Simon]].{{sfn|Glazer|1977|p=41}}}}

In 1978 the death of his father in May and the birth of his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=210}} Leng described the album as "melodic and lush&nbsp;... peaceful&nbsp;... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=210}}

The [[Death of John Lennon|murder of Lennon]] on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concerns about [[stalking|stalkers]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=247}} It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike McCartney and Starr, Harrison had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=265<U+2013>266}}; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|p=246}}.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|Their estrangement had been marked by Harrison's longstanding dislike of Lennon's wife [[Yoko Ono]], his refusal to allow her to participate in the Concert for Bangladesh, and, during the last year of Lennon's life, by Harrison's scant mention of Lennon in his autobiography, ''[[I, Me, Mine (book)|I, Me, Mine]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Doggett|2009|pp=265<U+2013>266}}; {{harvnb|Harry|2003|p=246}}.</ref>}} Following the murder, Harrison commented: "After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon.

===Knife attack and illness===

On 30 December 1999, 36-year-old Michael Abram broke into the Harrisons' [[Friar Park]] home and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife, puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a [[Fire iron#Types of fire irons|poker]] and a lamp.<ref name=NYTimes1299 />{{sfn|Idle|2005|pp=277<U+2013>278}} Following the attack, Harrison was hospitalized with more than forty stab wounds.

==Musicianship==

===Songwriting===
{{Main|List of songs recorded by George Harrison}}

Harrison wrote his first song, "Don't Bother Me" while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963, as "an exercise to see if I ''could'' write a song", <!--emphasis in original-->as he remembered.{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=84}} "Don't Bother Me" appeared on the band's second album, ''[[With the Beatles]]'', later that year, then on ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' in the US in early 1964.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=159<U+2013>160}} In 1965, he contributed "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]" and "[[You Like Me Too Much]]" to the album ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]''.{{sfn|Harry|2000|pp=551: "I Need You", 1190: "You Like Me Too Much"}}{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=xv}}

Harrison's songwriting ability improved through the years, but his material did not earn full respect from his fellow Beatles until near the group's break-up. In 1969, McCartney told Lennon: "Until this year, our songs have been better than George's. Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours".<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=554}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Fawcett|1977|p=96}}: (secondary source).</ref> Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=174}}{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=413}} Most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions, and there are three of his songs on the 1966 ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]'' LP, "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter", according to musicologist and author Ian Inglis.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xv: most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions, 7:''Revolver''}}

{{Listen|filename= "Within You Without You" by the Beatles, written by George Harrison, 1967.ogg |title="Within You Without You"|description=An audio sample of Harrison's "Within You Without You", 1967|}}

Of the 1967 Harrison song "[[Within You Without You]]", author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrison had created a "new form", calling the composition: "a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=31}} Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=243}} Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described "Something" as a masterpiece: "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced."{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=837}} According to author Kenneth Womack: 'Harrison comes into his own on ''Abbey Road''&nbsp;... "Here Comes the Sun" is matched<U+2014>indeed, surpassed<U+2014>only by "Something", his crowning achievement'.{{sfn|Womack|2006|p=89}} Inglis considered ''Abbey Road'' a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's contributions to the LP as "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics, particularly from McCartney.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=15}}

His interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles.
According to ''Rolling Stone'': "Harrison's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions. His use of dissonance on&nbsp;... 'Taxman' and 'I Want to Tell You' was revolutionary in popular music <U+2013> and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Edgar Varese]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]]".{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=37}} In 1997, author Gerry Farrell commented: "It is a mark of Harrison's sincere involvement&nbsp;... that, nearly thirty years on, the Beatles' 'Indian' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=316}}

''Rolling Stone'' founder [[Jann Wenner]] described Harrison as "a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate, eloquent melodic sense. He played exquisitely in the service of the song".{{sfn|Harrison|2002|p=15}} Harrison's friend and former bandmate, Tom Petty agreed: "He just had a way of getting right to the business, of finding the right thing to play."{{sfn|Petty|2011|p=58}} The [[guitar picking]] style of [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Carl Perkins]] influenced Harrison, giving a [[country music]] feel to many of the Beatles' recordings.{{sfn|Kitts|2002|p=17}} He identified [[Chuck Berry]] as an early influence and [[Ry Cooder]] as an important later influence.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=294<U+2013>295}}: Perkins; {{harvnb|Harry|2000|pp=140<U+2013>141}}: Berry; {{harvnb|Keltner|2002|p=231}}: Cooder.</ref>

In 1961 the Beatles recorded "[[Cry for a Shadow]]", a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison, who is credited with composing the song's lead guitar part, building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as [[the Shadows]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=4<U+2013>5}} Musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time, he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=48}} Harrison's liberal use of the [[diatonic scale]] in his guitar playing reveals the influence of [[Buddy Holly]], and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the [[blues scale]] while incorporating a [[rockabilly]] feel in the style of Perkins.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}} Within this framework he often utilized [[syncopation]], such as during his guitar solos for the Beatles' covers of Berry's "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" and "[[Too Much Monkey Business]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=62<U+2013>63, 136}} Another musical technique used by Harrison was the use of guitar lines written in [[octave]]s, as on "[[I'll Be on My Way]]".{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134<U+2013>135}} He was the first person to own a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]], a guitar that featured twelve strings, six of which are tuned one octave higher than the previous string, producing distinct overtones.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134<U+2013>135}} His use of one during the recording of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' helped to popularize the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that ''[[Melody Maker]]'' termed it the Beatles' "secret weapon".<ref>{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=120}}: "secret weapon"; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=14}}: Harrison helped to popularize the model.</ref>{{refn|group=nb|[[Roger McGuinn]] liked the effect so much that it became his signature guitar sound with the Byrds.{{sfn|Doggett|Hodgson|2004|p=82}}}}

Harrison wrote the [[chord progression]] of his first published song, "Don't Bother Me" (1963), almost exclusively in [[Dorian mode]], demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music. The dark [[timbre]] of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C+9 [[Chord (music)|chord]] voicings, performing a solo in the [[Pentatonic scale#Minor pentatonic scale|minor pentatonic scale]].{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=193<U+2013>195}} By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist, writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones, as with the ending chord arpeggios on "[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}} In 1965 he used an [[Expression pedal#Guitars and digital effects|expression pedal]] to control his guitar's volume on "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]", creating a syncopated [[String instrument#Contact points along the string|flautando]] effect with the melody resolving its [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|dissonance]] through tonal displacements.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=284<U+2013>285}} He used the same volume-swell technique on "[[Yes It Is]]", applying what Everett described as "ghostly articulation" to the song's [[Harmonic|natural harmonics]].{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=13}}

Of ''Rubber Soul''{{'}}s "[[If I Needed Someone]]", Harrison said: "it's like a million other songs written around the D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies&nbsp;... it amazes me that people still find new permutations of the same notes."{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=318}} His other contribution to the album, "[[Think For Yourself]]" features what Everett described as "ambiguous tonal coloring", utilizing [[chromaticism]] in [[Major chord|G major]] with a "strange" mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a "tour de force of altered scale degrees".<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=19}}: "altered scale degrees"; {{harvnb|Everett|2001|p=331}}: "ambiguous tonal coloring".</ref> In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to ''Revolver''. He played [[Backmasking|backwards]] guitar on Lennon's composition "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]" and a guitar [[counter-melody]] on "[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]" that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=47, 49<U+2013>51}} His guitar playing on "[[I Want to Tell You]]" exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for ''Sgt Pepper's'' "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]" mirrors Lennon's vocal line in much the same way that a [[sarangi]] player accompanies a [[khyal]] singer in a Hindu [[bhajan|devotional song]].<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|p=58}}: "I Want to Tell You"; {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=179<U+2013>180}}: Harrison's guitar part for "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds",</ref>

Everett described Harrison's guitar solo from "[[Old Brown Shoe]]" as "stinging [and] highly Claptonesque".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=243}} He identified two of the composition's significant [[Motif (music)|motifs]]: a bluesy [[trichord]] and a [[diminished triad]] with roots in A and E.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=244}} Huntley called the song "a sizzling rocker with a ferocious&nbsp;... solo."{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=35}} In Greene's opinion, Harrison's [[Demo (music)|demo]] for the song contains "one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song."{{sfn|Greene|2006|p=140}}

Harrison's playing on ''Abbey Road'', and in particular on "Something", marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist. The song's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences, incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian [[Gamaka (music)|gamakas]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=42}} According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack: "'Something' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison's guitar solos&nbsp;... A masterpiece in simplicity, [it] reaches toward the sublime".{{sfn|Womack|2006|p=89}} Harrison received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for "Something", as "The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year".{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=12}}

After [[Delaney Bramlett]] inspired him to learn slide guitar, Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work, which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments, including the [[sarangi]] and the [[dilruba]].{{sfn|Leng|2006|pp=84<U+2013>85}} Leng described Harrison's slide guitar solo on Lennon's "[[How Do You Sleep? (John Lennon song)|How Do You Sleep?"]] as a departure for "the sweet soloist of 'Something'", calling his playing "rightly famed&nbsp;... one of Harrison's greatest guitar statements."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=109}} Lennon commented: "That's the best he's ever fucking played in his life."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=109}}

A [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]] influence is notable in much of Harrison's music, ranging from his slide guitar work on ''Gone Troppo'' (1982) to his televised performance of the [[Cab Calloway]] standard "[[Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (song)|Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea]]" on [[ukulele]] in 1992.<ref>{{harvnb|Harry|2003|pp=29<U+2013>30}}: Performing "Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea" with Holland; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=232}}: Hawaiian influence on ''Gone Troppo''.</ref> Lavezzoli described Harrison's slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental "Marwa Blues" (2002) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian [[sarod]] or [[Veena (Instrument)|veena]], calling it "yet another demonstration of Harrison's unique slide approach".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=198}} Harrison was an admirer of [[George Formby]] and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain, and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of "Free as a Bird".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=279}} He performed at a Formby convention in 1991, and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|pp=149, 232}} Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks, including the Beatles' songs "[[Drive My Car]]", "[[She Said She Said]]", "[[Golden Slumbers]]", "[[Birthday (The Beatles song)|Birthday]]" and "[[Honey Pie]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=65: "She Said She Said", 268: "Golden Slumbers", 196: "Birthday", 190: "Honey Pie"}}; {{harvnb|Glazer|1977|p=36}}: "Drive My Car".</ref> He also played bass on several solo recordings, including "[[Faster (George Harrison song)|Faster]]", "[[Wake Up My Love]]" and "[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)#George Harrison's version|Bye Bye Love]]".{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=205: "Faster", 230: "Wake Up My Love", 152: "Bye Bye Love"}}

===Sitar and Indian music===
[[File:Ravi Shankar 2009 crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=An elderly man is seated at the centre of the image, holding a sitar.||[[Ravi Shankar]] in 2009]]

During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965 Harrison's friend [[David Crosby]] of the Byrds introduced him to [[Indian classical music]] and the work of [[sitar]] maestro Ravi Shankar.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=147}} Harrison became fascinated with the instrument, immersed himself in Indian music, and played a pivotal role in expanding the emerging interest in the sitar and [[Music of India|Indian music]] in the West.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=172}} According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of sitar: "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966<U+2013>67."{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=171}} Lavezzoli described Harrison as "the man most responsible for this phenomenon&nbsp;... the tidal wave of Western infatuation with Indian music".{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=171<U+2013>172}}

In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle, asked to be his student, and was accepted.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} Later, Shankar and [[Alla Rakha]] gave a private concert at Harrison's house that Starr and Lennon attended.<ref>{{harvnb|Glazer|1977|p=36}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}}: (secondary source).</ref> On 6 July, Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} Lavezzoli described Harrison's sitar playing on the ''Revolver'' track "[[Love You To]]" as an "astonishing improvement" over "Norwegian Wood" and "the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician."{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=175}} In September, he returned to India to study sitar with Shankar.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} He initially stayed in Bombay, then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake where Shankar taught him for six weeks.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=176}} After Shankar, he received tutelage from Shambhu Das.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=71}} He studied the instrument until 1968, when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing. He commented: "I decided&nbsp;... I should get back to the guitar because I'm not getting any better at it, and I'm not going to be a great sitar player&nbsp;... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier." <ref>{{harvnb|Harrison|2002|p=57}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Lavezzoli|2006|p=185}}: (secondary source).</ref>

In addition to popularizing Indian music in general, Harrison's befriending of Shankar helped to raise the Indian musician's profile in the West. "I was known very well and quite famous in the classical sense," Shankar later said, "but meeting George&nbsp;... that created such a tremendous [interest] all over the world&nbsp;... Which helped me to become like a pop star".<ref>{{cite album-notes |title=Collaborations |artist=Ravi Shankar & George Harrison |last=Harrison |first=Olivia |year=2010 |publisher=Rhino}}</ref> Harrison was influential in the decision to have Shankar included on the bill at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, and at [[Woodstock]] in 1969. The Concert for Bangladesh in 1971 led to Indian classical music reaching a larger audience than it had before.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=106, 172}} Leng called Harrison the "single-handed catalyst for a generation's interest in Indian culture."{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=44}}

Over time Harrison became an admirer of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles.{{sfn|Schaffner|1980|pp=77<U+2013>78}} During the filming of ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' in the [[Bahamas]], they met the founder of [[Sivananda Yoga]], [[Swami Vishnu-devananda]], who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, ''The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga''.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=173}} Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the ''Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' recording sessions, he took a pilgrimage to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] with his wife Pattie, where he studied sitar, met several [[guru]]s, and visited various holy places.{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=33}} The [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] gurus [[Mahavatar Babaji]], [[Lahiri Mahasaya]], [[Sri Yukteswar]] and [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] appear on the ''Sgt Pepper'' cover at his request.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=81}} In 1968 he travelled to [[Rishikesh]] in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=33}} Harrison's use of [[psychedelic drug]]s encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]], it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time<U+2014>these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music."{{sfn|Glazer|1977|p=41}}

Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s, and a devotee of the Indian mystic Paramahansa Yogananda.<ref>{{harvnb|Greene|2006|p=158}}: Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=56}}: Harrison became a devotee of Paramahansa Yogananda.</ref> In mid-1969, he produced the single "[[Hare Krishna Mantra]]", performed by members of the London [[Radha]] [[Krishna]] Temple. Soon after, Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition, particularly ''[[Japa|japa-yoga]]'' chanting with beads, and became a lifelong devotee.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=153}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1972 he bequeathed to the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] his [[Letchmore Heath]] mansion north of London. It was later converted to a temple and renamed [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]].<ref>{{harvnb|Huntley|2006|p=87}}; {{harvnb|Tillery|2011|p=111}}.</ref>}} He respected people of other faiths and once remarked: "All religions are branches of one big tree. It doesn't matter what you call Him just as long as you call."{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=78}} He commented on his beliefs:

{{quote|Krishna actually was in a body as a person&nbsp;... What makes it complicated is, if he's God, what's he doing fighting on a battlefield? It took me ages to try to figure that out, and again it was Yogananda's spiritual interpretation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' that made me realise what it was. Our idea of Krishna and [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield in the chariot. So this is the point<U+2014>that we're in these bodies, which is like a kind of chariot, and we're going through this incarnation, this life, which is kind of a battlefield. The senses of the body&nbsp;... are the horses pulling the chariot, and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reigns. And Arjuna in the end says, 'Please Krishna, you drive the chariot' because unless we bring [[Jesus|Christ]] or Krishna or [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] or whichever of our spiritual guides&nbsp;... we're going to crash our chariot, and we're going to turn over, and we're going to get killed in the battlefield. That's why we say {{'}}''Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna''{{'}}, asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot.{{sfn|Glazer|1977|pp=39<U+2013>40}}}}

Prior to his religious conversion, the only British performer known for similar activities had been [[Cliff Richard]], whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public. "By contrast," wrote Inglis, "Harrison's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity&nbsp;... what he, and the Beatles had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs."{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=11}}

===Relationships with the other Beatles===
For most of the Beatles' career the relationships in the group were close. According to [[Hunter Davies]], "the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life, but communally living the same life. They were each other's greatest friends." Harrison's wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles "all belonged to each other" and admitted, "George has a lot with the others that I can never know about. Nobody, not even the wives, can break through or even comprehend it."{{sfn|Davies|2009|p=325}}

Starr said, "We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together. In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the four of us would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there <U+2013> a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational."{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=357}}

Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was "one of young follower and older guy&nbsp;... [he] was like a disciple of mine when we started."{{sfn|Sheff|1981|p=148}} The two later bonded over their [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives.{{sfn|Tillery|2011|p=122}} Harrison said that Lennon "was both a saint and a bastard".{{sfn|Badman|2001|p=139}}

McCartney and Harrison were the first of the Beatles to meet, having shared a school bus, and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|pp=xiii<U+2013>xiv}} McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Playboy interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|work=[[Playboy]]|last=Goodman|first=Joan|issue=December 1984|page=84}}</ref> McCartney was best man at Harrison's wedding in 1966, and was the only Beatle in attendance.{{sfn|Huntley|2006|p=86}} McCartney has referred to Harrison as his "baby brother".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html |title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=The Telegraph|last1=Poole|first1=Oliver|last2=Davies|first2=Hugh|date=1 December 2001|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> In a 1974 BBC radio interview with [[Alan Freeman]], Harrison stated: "[McCartney] ruined me as a guitar player".{{sfn|Badman|2001|pp=138<U+2013>139}} Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney's personal relationship, as both men admitted that they often got on each other's nerves.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|p=48}} Author Robert Rodriguez commented: "even to the end of George's days, theirs was a volatile relationship".{{sfn|Rodriguez|2010|p=24}}

===Humanitarian work===
Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political [[activism]] throughout his life. In the 1960s, the Beatles supported the [[civil rights movement]] and protested against the Vietnam War. Following the band's break-up, Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the [[1970 Bhola Cyclone]] and the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref name="theconcertforbangladesh1">{{cite web|url= http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com/|title=The Concert For Bangladesh|publisher=Concertforbangladesh|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref> Harrison recorded the song "[[Bangla Desh (song)|Bangla Desh]]", and pushed Apple Records to release his song alongside Shankar's "Joy Bangla" in an effort to raise funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/spotlight-0801-2011.aspx|title=This Day in Music Spotlight:George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh|date=1 August 2011|last=Dooley|first=Sean Patrick|accessdate=1 January 2013|publisher=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]}}</ref> Shankar then asked for Harrison's advice about planning a small charity event in the US.

==HandMade Films==
{{Main|HandMade Films}}

In 1973 [[Peter Sellers]] introduced Harrison to [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]]. Soon after, the two went into business together.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=211}} In 1978, in an effort to produce ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|2009|pp=362<U+2013>363}}; {{harvnb|Doggett|2009|p=262}}.</ref> Harrison explained: "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset&nbsp;... [near] an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'&nbsp;... So we said&nbsp;... we'll call it Handmade Films."{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=211}}

Their opportunity for investment came after [[EMI Films]] withdrew funding at the demand of their Chief Executive, [[Bernard Delfont]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=211<U+2013>212}} Harrison financed the production of ''Life of Brian'' in part by mortgaging his home, which Idle later called "the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history."{{sfn|Doggett|2009|p=262}} The film grossed $21 million at the box office in the US.{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=211}} The first film distributed by HandMade Films was ''[[The Long Good Friday]]'' (1980), and the first they produced was ''[[Time Bandits]]'' (1981), a co-scripted project by [[Monty Python]]{{'}}s [[Terry Gilliam]] and [[Michael Palin]].{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=212}} The film featured a new song by Harrison, "[[Dream Away]]", in the closing credits.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=83}} ''Time Bandits'' became one of HandMade's most successful and acclaimed efforts; with a budget of $5 million, it earned $35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=83}}

Harrison served as [[Film producer|executive producer]] for 23 films with HandMade, including ''[[Mona Lisa (movie)|Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'' and ''[[Withnail and I]]''. He made several [[cameo appearance]]s in these films, including a role as a nightclub singer in ''Shanghai Surprise'', for which he recorded five new songs.{{sfn|Leng|2006|p=244}} According to author and musicologist Ian Inglis, Harrison's "executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis, producing some of the country's most memorable movies of the 1980s."{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=xvi}} A series of [[box office bomb]]s in the late 1980s caused HandMade to cease operations in 1991 and in 1994, the company was sold.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=211<U+2013>213}}

==Legacy==

In 2002, on the first anniversary of his death, the [[Concert for George]] was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Clapton organized the concert, which included performances by many of Harrison's friends and musical collaborators, including McCartney and Starr. The profits from the concert went to Harrison's charity, the Material World Charitable Foundation.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=138<U+2013>139}}
