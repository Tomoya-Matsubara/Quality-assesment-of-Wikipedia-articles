'''Sikhote-Alin''' is an [[iron meteorite]] that fell in 1947 on the [[Sikhote-Alin Mountains]] in eastern Siberia.  Though large iron meteorite falls had been witnessed previously and fragments recovered, never before in recorded history had a fall of this magnitude been observed.<ref>{{cite book |first=O.

==Impact==
[[Image:Sikhote-Alin stamp 1957.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The 10th anniversary stamp. It reproduces a painting by P. J. Medvedev.]]
At around 10:30 on 12 February 1947, eyewitnesses in the [[Sikhote-Alin Mountains]], [[Primorsky Krai|Primorye]], Soviet Union, observed a large [[bolide]] brighter than the [[Sun]] that came out of the north and descended at an angle of about 41 degrees. The bright flash and the deafening sound of the fall were observed for {{convert|300|km|mi}} around the point of impact not far from [[Luchegorsk]] and approximately {{convert|440|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Vladivostok]]. A smoke trail, estimated at {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, remained in the sky for several hours.

As the meteor, traveling at a speed of about {{convert|14|km/s|mi/s|abbr=on}}, entered the atmosphere, it began to break apart, and the fragments fell together. At an altitude of about {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the largest mass apparently broke up in a violent explosion called [[air burst]].

On November 20, 1957<ref name=stamps>[http://www.pibburns.com/catastro/metstamp.htm Meteorite Stamps and Coins] Philip R. "Pib" Burns</ref> the [[Soviet Union]] issued a stamp for the 10th anniversary of the Sikhote-Alin meteorite shower. It reproduces a painting by P. J. Medvedev, a Soviet artist who witnessed the fall: he was sitting in his window starting a sketch when the fireball appeared, so he immediately began drawing what he saw.<ref>[http://www.planetarium.montreal.qc.ca/Information/Expo_Meteorites/Vedettes/sikhotealin_a.html Sikhote Alin] - Planetarium de Montreal</ref>

==Orbit==
Because the [[meteor]] fell during daytime, it was observed by many eyewitnesses. Evaluation of this observational data allowed [[V. G. Fesenkov]], then chairman of the meteorite committee of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Science]], to estimate the [[meteoroid|meteoroid's]] [[orbit]] before it encountered the Earth. This orbit was [[ellipse]]-shaped, with its point of greatest distance from the [[sun]] situated within the [[asteroid belt]], similar to many other small bodies crossing the orbit of the Earth. Such an orbit was probably created by collisions within the asteroid belt.

==Size==
Sikhote-Alin is a massive fall with the overall size of the [[meteoroid]] estimated at approximately {{convert|90000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  A more recent estimate by Tsvetkov (and others) puts the mass at around {{convert|100000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://meteoritemag.uark.edu/604.htm|journal=Meteorite Magazine|location= Arkansas Center for Space and Planetary Sciences, University of Arkansas|title=Sikhote-Alin Revisited|author=Roy Gallant|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100612144717/http://meteoritemag.uark.edu/604.htm|archivedate=June 12, 2010|date=February 1996}}</ref>

Krinov had estimated the post-atmospheric mass of the meteoroid at some {{convert|23000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Strewn field and craters==
The [[strewn field]] for this meteorite covered an elliptical area of about {{convert|1.3|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Some of the fragments made [[impact craters]], the largest of which was about {{convert|26|m|ft|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep.<ref>{{cite Earth Impact DB | name = Sikhote-Alin| accessdate = 2009-08-19}}</ref> Fragments of the meteorite were also driven into the surrounding trees.

==Composition and classification==
[[File:Sikhote alin.jpg|thumb|200px|Section]]
The Sikhote-Alin meteorite is classified as an [[iron meteorite]] belonging to the chemical group IIAB and with a coarse [[octahedrite]] structure. It is composed of approximately 93% [[iron]], 5.9% [[nickel]], 0.42% [[cobalt]], 0.46% [[phosphorus]], and 0.28% [[sulfur]], with trace amounts of [[germanium]] and [[iridium]]. Minerals present include [[taenite]], [[plessite]], [[troilite]], [[chromite]], [[kamacite]], and [[schreibersite]].

==Specimens==
Specimens of the Sikhote-Alin Meteorite are basically of two types<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010415042416/http://www.meteor.co.nz/feb96_1.html|work=www.meteor.co.nz|title=Sikhote-Alin Revisited|author=Roy Gallant
|date=February 1996}}</ref>:
# ''individual'', ''thumbprinted'' or ''regmaglypted specimens'', showing fusion crust and signs of atmospheric [[ablation]]
# ''shrapnel'' or ''fragmented specimens'', sharp edged pieces of torn metal showing evidence of violent fragmentation
The first type probably broke off the main object early in the descent. These pieces are characterized by [[regmaglypt]]s (cavities resembling thumb prints) in the surface of each specimen. The second type are fragments which were either torn apart during the atmospheric explosions or blasted apart upon impact on the frozen ground. Most were probably the result of the explosion at {{convert|5.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude.

A large specimen is on display in [[Moscow]]. Many other specimens are held by [[Russian Academy of Science]] and a great number of smaller specimens have made their way into the collector's market.
