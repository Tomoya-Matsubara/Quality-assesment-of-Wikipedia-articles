In January 1873 he was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]].<ref name="DNB"/>

In April 1875 Earwaker began the publication in the ''[[Manchester Courier]]'' of a series ''Local Gleanings relating to Lancashire and Cheshire'', which ran until January 1878, and then was republished in two volumes. It was followed in 1878-80 by a periodical entitled ''Local Gleanings: an Arch<U+00E6>ological and Historical Magazine'', of which one volume was completed. The first volume of his ''East Cheshire, Past and Present; or a History of the Hundred of Macclesfield'' was published in 1877, and the second in 1881.<ref name="DNB"/>

In 1882 the corporation of Manchester decided to print the ''Court Leet Records of the Manor of Manchester'', ranging from 1552 to 1846, and Earwaker was engaged as editor. The work, with annotations, extended to twelve [[royal octavo]] volumes, the first of which was printed in 1884, and the last in 1890. It was supplemented by ''The Constables' Accounts of the Manor of Manchester, from 1612 to 1647 and from 1743 to 1776'', 3 vols. 1891-2. Earwaker put the Congleton corporation records into admirable order, and work on family papers resulted in monographs, as his ''Agecroft Hall, near Manchester, and the Old Deeds and Charters relating to it.'' He was one of the founders and honorary secretary of the Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, and a member of the councils of the [[Chetham Society]], the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, the Chester Archaeological Society, and the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society. He contributed to the publications of these societies, and he wrote also in the ''[[Athen<U+00E6>um (magazine)|Athen<U+00E6>um]]'', ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', and other journals.<ref name="DNB"/>
