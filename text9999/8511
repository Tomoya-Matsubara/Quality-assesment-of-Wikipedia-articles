'''Tropical Storm Debby''' caused extensive flooding in [[North Florida]] and the [[Florida Panhandle]]. The fourth [[tropical cyclone]] and [[Tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[2012 Atlantic hurricane season]], Debby developed from a trough of low pressure in the central [[Gulf of Mexico]] on June&nbsp;23 Despite a projected track toward landfall in [[Louisiana]] or [[Texas]], the storm headed the opposite direction, moving slowly north-northeast or northeastward. The storm steadily strengthened, and at 1800&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;25, Debby attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h). Dry air, westerly wind shear, and [[upwelling]] prevented further intensification. Instead, Debby weakened, and by late on June&nbsp;26, it was a minimal tropical storm. At 2100&nbsp;UTC, the storm made landfall near [[Steinhatchee, Florida]] with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h). Debby continued to weaken while crossing Florida, and dissipated shortly after emerging into the Atlantic on June&nbsp;27.

The storm dropped immense amounts of precipitation near its path. Rainfall peaked at {{convert|28.78|in|mm}} in Curtis Mill, Florida, located in southwestern [[Wakulla County, Florida|Wakulla County]]. The [[Sopchoppy River]], which reached its record height, flooded at least 400&nbsp;structures in Wakulla County. Additionally, the [[Suwannee River]] reached its highest level since [[Hurricane Dora]] in [[1964 Atlantic hurricane season|1964]]. Further south in [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]], the [[Anclote River]] and [[Pithlachascotee River]] overflowed, flooding communities with "head deep" water and causing damage to 106&nbsp;homes. An additional 587&nbsp;homes were inundated after the [[Black Creek (Florida)|Black Creek]] overflowed in [[Clay County, Florida|Clay County]]. Several roads and highways in North Florida were left impassable, including [[Interstate 10]] and [[U.S. Route 90]]. [[U.S. Route 19|U.S. Routes 19]] and [[U.S. Route 98|98]] were also inundated by coastal flooding. In [[Central Florida|Central]] and [[South Florida]], damage was primarily caused by tornadoes, one of which caused a fatality. Overall, Debby at least $210&nbsp;million in losses and 10&nbsp;deaths, 8&nbsp;in Florida and 1 each in [[Alabama]] and [[South Carolina]].

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Debby 2012 track.png}}
The [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) migrated northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico in mid-June. Coinciding with a [[Madden<U+2013>Julian oscillation]], a weak surface low pressure area developed on June&nbsp;19, and subsequently moved inland over the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]]. While the system crossed the peninsula, a tropical wave moved through the northwestern [[Caribbean Sea]] on June&nbsp;18. The wave reached the Gulf of Mexico on June&nbsp;20 and merged with the low a few days later, spawning a trough of low pressure on June&nbsp;22. Located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, moderate vertical wind shear caused the system to remain disorganized. Nonetheless, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the trough acquired a low-level circulation on June&nbsp;23, while ships in the area reported tropical storm force winds. Thus, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Debby developed at 1200&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;23, centered about {{convert|290|mi|km}} south of mouth of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name="dtcr"/>

Becoming a tropical storm on June&nbsp;23, Debby became the earliest fourth named storm in the Atlantic basin, surpassing the old record set by [[Hurricane Dennis]] on July&nbsp;5, 2005. Initially, Debby was predicted to curve westward and potentially threaten [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al04/al042012.discus.001.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number 1|author=Robbie J.

The forecast track for Debby was shifted significantly to the east late on June&nbsp;24, and it was predicted that the storm would move northward and make landfall near [[Panama City, Florida]].<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al04/al042012.discus.006.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number 6|author=Lixion A.

However, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear, drier air, and [[upwelling]], caused by Debby's slow movement.<ref name="dtcr"/> It was initially composed of multiple small swirls, but consolidated into one well-defined low-level circulation by early on June&nbsp;25.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al04/al042012.discus.007.shtml?|title=Tropical Storm Debby Discussion Number 7|author=Stacy R.

Debby began curving east-northeastward and began to speed up on June&nbsp;26, in response to a mid-latitude trough digging into the western Atlantic Ocean. While approaching the [[Big Bend (Florida)|Florida Big Bend]], Debby produced only a small area of deep convection on satellite imagery.<ref name="dtcr"/>

At 2100&nbsp;UTC June&nbsp;26, Debby made landfall near [[Steinhatchee, Florida]] with winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h). The storm weakened quickly after moving inland, and by early on June&nbsp;27, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, while located about {{convert|35|mi|km}} north of [[Gainesville, Florida]]. Debby maintained tropical cyclone status while crossing Florida, but degenerated into a trough of low pressure by 1800&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;27.<ref name="dtcr"/> In the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center three hours later, the agency noted that Debby could eventually reacquire tropical characteristics.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2012/al04/al042012.discus.018.shtml?|title=Post-Tropical Cyclone Debby Discussion Number 18|author=Todd B.

As it accelerated northward, Debby's remnants became increasingly frontal in nature, and once again degenerated into an open trough at 1800&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;30; at this time, the disturbance was located south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref name="dtcr">{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL042012_Debby.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Tropical Storm Debby|author=Todd B.

==Preparations==
Upon development of Debby on June&nbsp;23, a tropical storm warning was issued from the mouth of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi<U+2013>Louisiana)|Pearl River]] to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]], excluding [[New Orleans]] or [[Lake Pontchartrain]]. On the following day, a separate tropical storm warning was put into effect from the Mississippi and Alabama border to the mouth of the [[Ochlockonee River]] in Florida. At 1500&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;24, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of the [[Suwannee River]]. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to [[Anclote Key]]. These were all canceled at 1500&nbsp;UTC on June&nbsp;25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from [[Destin, Florida|Destin]] to [[Englewood, Florida]]. Early on June&nbsp;26, a tropical storm warning was issued from [[Mexico Beach, Florida|Mexico Beach]] to [[Englewood, Florida]]. By 2100&nbsp;UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of [[Steinhatchee River]] in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.<ref name="dtcr"/> In addition to [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches]], voluntary evacuations were issued for several areas in northwest Florida during the approach of the storm; a mandatory evacuation was issued for [[St. George Island (Florida)|St. George Island]].<ref name="Apclose">{{cite web|url=http://www.apalachtimes.com/news/debby-10348-island-barge.html|title=BREAKING: More flooding closes more roads|last=Adlerstein|first=David|date=June 26, 2012|work=Apalach Times|accessdate=2012-06-27|location=Apalachicola, FL}}</ref>
