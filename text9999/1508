The '''1930 FIFA World Cup''' was the inaugural edition of the world championship for international [[association football]] teams &ndash; the [[FIFA World Cup]]. It was played in [[Uruguay]] from 13 July to 30 July. [[FIFA|F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) selected Uruguay as host nation as the country would be celebrating the centenary of its independence, and the [[Uruguay national football team]] had successfully retained their football title at the [[1928 Summer Olympics]]. All matches were played in the Uruguayan capital, [[Montevideo]], the majority at the [[Estadio Centenario]], which was built for the tournament.

Thirteen teams, nine from the [[Americas]] and four from Europe, entered the tournament. Few European teams chose to participate due to the duration and cost of travel. The teams were divided into four groups, with the winner of each group progressing to the semi-finals. The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously, and were won by [[France national football team|France]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], who defeated [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 4<U+2013>1 and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3<U+2013>0, respectively. [[Lucien Laurent]] of France scored the first goal in World Cup history. 

[[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Uruguay, the USA and [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] each won their respective groups to qualify for the semi-finals. In the final, hosts and pre-tournament favourites Uruguay defeated Argentina 4<U+2013>2 in front of a crowd of 93,000&nbsp;people, and became the first nation to win a World Cup.

==Origins==
In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic football tournament]] as a "world football championship for amateurs",<ref name="FIFAhistory">{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/fifa/historyfifa4.html |title=History of FIFA - The first FIFA World Cup |publisher=FIFA| accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> and took responsibility for managing the event at the next three Olympiads: from 1920 to 1928. In the [[1908 Olympic Games]] and the [[1912 Olympic Games]] the football competitions had been organised by [[The Football Association]] and the [[Swedish Football Association]] respectively.  

The preliminary schedule for the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] did not include football. FIFA and the [[International Olympic Committee]] disagreed over the status of amateur players, so football was dropped from the Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=8229/news/newsid=92851.html |title=The Olympic Odyssey so far...

The first World Cup was the only one without [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification]]. Every country affiliated with FIFA was invited to compete, and given a deadline of 28 February 1930 to accept. Plenty of interest was shown by nations in the Americas; [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] all entered. However, due to the long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean, and the length of absence required for players,<ref name="FIFAhistory"/> very few European teams were inclined to take part. Some refused to countenance travel to South America in any circumstances,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunt|first=Chris |title=World Cup Stories: The History of the FIFA World Cup |publisher=Interact |date=2006 |location=Ware |id=ISBN 0-9549819-2-8|page=10}}</ref> and no European entries were received before the February deadline. In an attempt to gain some European participation, the Uruguayan Football Association sent a letter of invitation to [[The Football Association]], even though the [[Home Nations]] were not members of FIFA at the time.

The first group was the only one to contain four teams: Argentina, Chile, France and Mexico. Two days after France's victory over Mexico, they faced group favourites Argentina. Injuries hindered France; goalkeeper [[Alex Th<U+00E9>pot|Th<U+00E9>pot]] had to leave the field after 20&nbsp;minutes, and Laurent, after a fierce tackle by [[Luis Monti]], spent most of the match limping. However, they held out for most of the match, only succumbing to an 81st-minute goal scored from a Monti [[direct free kick|free kick]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Freddi |first=Cris |title=Complete Book of the World Cup 2006|publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |date=2006 |id=ISBN 0-00-722916-X|page=3}}</ref> The game featured an officiating controversy when referee [[Almeida Rego]] erroneously blew the final whistle six minutes early, with Frenchman [[Marcel Langiller]] clear on goal; play only resumed after protests from the French players.<ref name="Glanville18">Glanville, p. 18</ref> Though France had played twice in 48 hours, Chile had yet to play their first match.

Argentina's second match, against Mexico, featured the first [[penalty kick|penalty]] of the tournament. A total of five penalties, three of them controversial, were awarded during the match, which was refereed by the Bolivian coach [[Ulises Saucedo]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Six countries entered bidding for first World Cup|work=The Times of India| publisher=Times Internet|url=http://sport.indiatimes.com/soccerarticleshow/1533342.cms| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060615213553/http://sport.indiatimes.com/soccerarticleshow/1533342.cms| archivedate=2006-06-15| accessdate=2007-05-07 }}</ref> [[Guillermo St<U+00E1>bile]] scored a [[hat-trick]] on his international debut<ref>{{cite web | title=1930 Golden Boot - Guillermo Stabile|publisher=Sky Sports| url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060829040743/http://home.skysports.com/worldcup/historyarticle.aspx?hlid=373666| accessdate=2009-06-20 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060829040743/http://home.skysports.com/worldcup/historyarticle.aspx?hlid=373666 | archivedate=2009-06-20}} (archive.org mirror)</ref> as Argentina won 6<U+2013>3, despite the absence of their captain [[Manuel Ferreira]], who had returned to Buenos Aires to take a law exam.<ref>{{cite book |last=Seddon |first=Peter |title=The World Cup's Strangest Moments |publisher=Robson |location=London |date=2005 |id=ISBN 1-86105-869-1|page=5}}</ref> Qualification was decided by the  group's final match, contested by Argentina and Chile, who had beaten France and Mexico respectively. The game was marred by a brawl sparked by a foul on [[Arturo Torres Carrasco|Arturo Torres]] by Monti.<ref name="Glanville18"/> Argentina won 3<U+2013>1 against their neighbours and progressed to the semi-finals.

===Group 2===
The second group contained Brazil, Bolivia and Yugoslavia. Brazil, the group seeds, were expected to progress. However, in the group's opening match Yugoslavia gained an unexpected 2<U+2013>1 victory over Brazil.<ref name="Glanville19">Glanville, p. 19</ref> Going into the tournament Bolivia had never previously won an international match. For their opener they paid tribute to the hosts by wearing shirts each emblazoned with a single letter, spelling "Viva Uruguay" as the team lined up.<ref name="f5"/> Both of Bolivia's matches followed a similar pattern, a promising start gradually transforming into heavy defeat.

[[Ulises Saucedo]]'s Bolivia side finally changed into an alternate [[kit (association football)|kit]] at half-time. --> Yugoslavia qualified for the semi-finals.

===Group 3===
Hosts Uruguay were in a group with Peru and Romania. The opening match in this group saw the first sending off in the competition, when [[Pl<U+00E1>cido Galindo]] of Peru was [[sent off|dismissed]] against Romania. The Romanians made their man advantage pay; their 3<U+2013>1 win included two late goals. This match had the smallest crowd of any in World Cup history. The official attendance was 2,459, but the actual figure is generally accepted to be around 300.<ref>Freddi, p. 7</ref> 

Due to construction delays at Estadio Centenario, Uruguay's first match was not played until five days into the tournament. The first to be held at the Centenario, it was preceded by a ceremony in honour of the Uruguayan centenary celebrations. The Uruguayan team spent the four weeks preceding the match in a training camp, at which strict discipline was exercised. Goalkeeper [[Andr<U+00E9>s Mazali]] was dropped from the squad for breaking a curfew to visit his wife.<ref>Freddi, p. 8</ref> One hundred years to the day of the creation of Uruguay's first constitution, the hosts won a tight match against Peru 1<U+2013>0.

===Group 4===
The United States dominated the fourth group. The USA team, which contained a significant number of new [[cap (sport)|caps]], were reputedly nicknamed "the shot-putters" by an unnamed source in the French contingent.<ref name="BBC1930"/> They beat their first opponents, Belgium, 3<U+2013>0. The ease of the victory was unexpected; Uruguayan newspaper ''Imparcial'' wrote that "the large score of the American victory has really surprised the experts".<ref name="Almeida">{{cite book |last= Almeida|first= Rony J.| title= Where It All Began | page=91|publisher= Lulu |date= 2006 |isbn= 978-1411679061}}</ref> Belgian reports bemoaned the state of the [[association football pitch|pitch]] and refereeing decisions, claiming that the second goal was [[offside (football)|offside]].<ref name="Almeida"/> The group's second match, played in windy conditions,<ref>Freddi, p. 9</ref> witnessed the first tournament [[hat-trick]], scored by [[Bert Patenaude]] of the United States against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. Until 10 November 2006 the first hat-trick that FIFA acknowledged had been scored by [[Guillermo St<U+00E1>bile]] of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], two days after Patenaude; however, in 2006 FIFA announced that Patenaude's claim to being the first hat-trick scorer was valid, as a goal previously assigned to teammate [[Tom Florie]]'s was reattributed to Patenaude.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid=107499.html | title=American Bert Patenaude credited with first hat trick in FIFA World Cup history | publisher=FIFA | accessdate=2009-06-19}}{{cite web| url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/30f-hattrick.html | title=The first World Cup hat trick | publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] (RSSSF)| accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref> With the USA having secured qualification, the final match in the group was a [[dead rubber]]. Paraguay beat Belgium by a 1<U+2013>0 margin.<ref name="Crouch6"/>

===Semi-finals===
The four group winners, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Yugoslavia, [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], and the United States, moved to the semi-finals. The two semi-final matches saw identical scores. In the first semi-final, a Monti goal half-way through the first half gave Argentina a 1<U+2013>0 half-time lead against the United States. In the second half the strength of the United States team was overwhelmed by the pace of the Argentinian attacks, the match finishing 6<U+2013>1 to Argentina.<ref name="Crouch11"/>

In the second semi-final there were shades of the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] match between Yugoslavia and Uruguay. Here, though, Yugoslavia took a surprise lead through [[Branislav Sekuli<U+0107>|Sekuli<U+0107>]]. Uruguay then took a 2<U+2013>1 lead, but shortly before half-time Yugoslavia had a goal disallowed due to a controversial offside decision.<ref name="Glanville19"/> The hosts scored four more in the second half to win 6<U+2013>1, [[Pedro Cea]] completing a hat-trick.<ref name="Crouch11"/>

===Third and fourth place===
The now-traditional [[third place playoff]] was not established until [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]], so the 1930 World Cup is unique in having no match take place between the semi-finals and the final. Occasional sources, notably a FIFA Bulletin from 1984, incorrectly imply that a third-place match occurred and was won 3<U+2013>1 by Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite web

The resounding wins for Uruguay and Argentina in the semi-finals meant the final was a repeat of the matchup in the 1928 Olympic final, which Uruguay won 2<U+2013>1 after a replay. 

The final was played at the [[Estadio Centenario]] on 30 July. Feelings ran high around the [[La Plata Basin]], dispelling any uncertainty as to whether the tournament had captured the imagination of the public. The ten boats earmarked to carry Argentine fans from Buenos Aires to Montevideo proved inadequate,<ref name="Glanville19"/> and any number of assorted craft attempted the crossing. An estimated 10<U+2013>15,000 Argentinians made the trip, but the port at Montevideo was so overwhelmed that many did not even make landfall before [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]], let alone reach the stadium.<ref>Goldblatt, p. 250</ref> At the stadium, supporters were searched for weapons.<ref>Freddi, p. 11</ref> The gates were opened at eight o'clock, six hours before kick-off, and at noon the ground was full,<ref name="Glanville19"/> the official attendance 93,000.<ref name="origin">{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/fifafacts/mcwc/ip-201_02e_fwc-origin_8816.pdf|title=FIFA World Cup Origin|format=PDF|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=2009-11-17}}</ref> A disagreement overshadowed the build-up to the match as the teams failed to agree on who should provide the match ball, forcing FIFA to intervene and decree that the Argentine team would provide the ball for the first half and the Uruguayans would provide their own for the second.<ref name="BBC1930"/> Uruguay made one change from their semi-final lineup. Castro replaced Anselmo, who missed out due to illness.<ref name="Crouch11">Crouch, p. 11.</ref> Monti played for Argentina despite receiving death threats on the eve of the match. The referee was Belgian Jean Langenus, who only agreed to officiate a few hours before the game, having sought assurances for his safety.<ref name="Glanville20">Glanville, p. 20</ref> One of his requests was for a boat to be ready at the harbour within one hour of the final whistle, in case he needed to make a quick escape.<ref>Goldblatt, p. 251</ref>

The hosts scored the opening goal through [[Pablo Dorado]], a low shot from a position on the right.<ref name="Freddi12">Freddi, p. 12.</ref> Argentina, displaying superior passing ability, responded strongly. Within eight minutes they were back on level terms. [[Carlos Peucelle]] received a Ferreira through-ball, beat his [[marking (association football)|marker]] and [[wikt:equalizer|equalised]].<ref name="Freddi12"/> Shortly before half-time leading tournament goalscorer Guillermo St<U+00E1>bile gave Argentina a 2<U+2013>1 lead. Uruguay captain Nasazzi protested, maintaining that St<U+00E1>bile was offside, but to no avail.<ref name="Glanville20"/> In the second half Uruguay gradually became ascendant. Shortly after Monti missed a chance to make the score 3<U+2013>1, Uruguay attacked in numbers, and [[Pedro Cea]] scored an equaliser.<ref name="Freddi12"/> Ten minutes later a goal by [[Santos Iriarte]] gave Uruguay the lead, and just before full-time Castro made it 4<U+2013>2 to seal the win.<ref name="Glanville20"/> Langenus ended the match a minute later, and Uruguay thus added the title World Cup winners to their mantle of Olympic champions.

[[File:Stad de centario uruguay1930 montevideo.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The [[Estadio Centenario]] hosted the majority of the tournament's matches.|alt=Painting of a bowl-shaped stadium, from a viewpoint high above. The stadium contins a football pitch. There are figures on the pitch, but they are too small to make out any detail. The stands, open to the air, are all full. At the left of the stadium there is a large white tower. In the foreground in front of the stadium is a row of trees. Beyond the stadium in the background is an indistinct mix of fields and buildings.]]All matches took place in [[Montevideo]]. Three stadiums were used: [[Estadio Centenario]], [[Estadio Pocitos]], and [[Estadio Gran Parque Central|Estadio Parque Central]]. The 100,000 capacity Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence.
