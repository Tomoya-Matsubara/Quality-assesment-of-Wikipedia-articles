'''The Museum of Modern Art''' ('''MoMA''') is an [[art museum]] in [[Midtown (Manhattan)|Midtown]] [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], on 53rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. It has been important in developing and collecting [[modern art|modernist art]], and is often identified as the most influential museum of modern art in the world.<ref name="Kleiner">{{cite book|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|coauthors=Christin J.

MoMA's library and archives hold over 300,000 books, artist books, and periodicals, as well as individual files on more than 70,000 artists. The archives contain primary source material related to the history of modern and [[contemporary art]]. It also houses a restaurant, The Modern, run by [[Alsace]]-born chef Gabriel Kreuther.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gayot.com/restaurantpages/NewYorkInfo.php?tag=NYRES050304&code=NY |title= The Modern|accessdate=2008-10-29 |work=Restaurant Review |publisher=Gayot| year=2008 }}</ref>

==History==
The idea for The Museum of Modern Art was developed in 1929 primarily by [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] (wife of [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]]) and two of her friends, [[Lillie P. Bliss]] and [[Mary Quinn Sullivan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_5_166/ai_n9505400 | title=Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: patron of the modern | author=Jeffers, Wendy|publisher=Magazine Antiques | date=2004-10 | accessdate=2008-04-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080129013201/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_5_166/ai_n9505400 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-29}}</ref> They became known variously as ''"the Ladies"'', ''"the daring ladies"'' and ''"the adamantine ladies"''. They rented modest quarters for the new museum in the Heckscher Building at 730 Fifth Avenue (corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street) in Manhattan, and it opened to the public on November 7, 1929, nine days after the [[Wall Street Crash]].  Abby had invited [[Anson Conger Goodyear|A. Conger Goodyear]], the former president of the board of trustees of the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery|Albright Art Gallery]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], to become president of the new museum. Abby became treasurer. At the time, it was America's premier museum devoted exclusively to modern art, and the first of its kind in Manhattan to exhibit European modernism.<ref>First modern art museum featuring European works in Manhattan <U+2013> [[Michael FitzGerald]], ''Making [[Modernism]]: Picasso and the Creation of the Market for Twentieth-Century Art''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1995. (p. 120)</ref>

Goodyear enlisted [[Paul J. Sachs]] and [[Frank Crowninshield]] to join him as founding trustees. Sachs, the associate director and curator of prints and drawings at the [[Fogg Art Museum]] at [[Harvard University]], was referred to in those days as a collector of curators. Goodyear asked him to recommend a director and Sachs suggested [[Alfred Barr|Alfred H. Barr Jr.]], a promising young protege. Under Barr's guidance, the museum's holdings quickly expanded from an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing. Its first successful loan exhibition was in November 1929, displaying paintings by [[Van Gogh]], [[Gauguin]], [[C<U+00E9>zanne]], and [[Seurat]].<ref>Origins of MoMA and first successful loan exhibition <U+2013> see John Ensor Harr and Peter J. Johnson, ''The Rockefeller Century: Three Generations of America's Greatest Family'', New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988. (pp.217<U+2013>18)</ref>

First housed in six rooms of galleries and offices on the twelfth floor of Manhattan's Heckscher Building,<ref name="HeckscherCrown">{{cite web |url= http://www.thecityreview.com/crown.html |title= The Crown Building (formerly the Heckscher Building) |author= Carter B. Horsley |work= The City Review }}</ref> on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, the museum moved into three more temporary locations within the next ten years. Abby's husband was adamantly opposed to the museum (as well as to modern art itself) and refused to release funds for the venture, which had to be obtained from other sources and resulted in the frequent shifts of location. Nevertheless, he eventually donated the land for the current site of the museum, plus other gifts over time, and thus became in effect one of its greatest benefactors.<ref>John D. Rockefeller, Jr. one of MoMA's greatest benefactors <U+2013> see Bernice Kert, ''Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: The Woman in the Family''. New York: Random House, 1993. (pp.376,386)</ref>[[File:NY MOMA Entrance.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The entrance to The Museum of Modern Art]]

During that time it initiated many more exhibitions of noted artists, such as the lone [[Vincent van Gogh]] exhibition on November 4, 1935. Containing an unprecedented sixty-six oils and fifty drawings from the [[Netherlands]], and poignant excerpts from the artist's letters, it was a major public success and became "a precursor to the hold van Gogh has to this day on the contemporary imagination".<small><ref>Precursor to the current hold of van Gogh in public imagination <U+2013> Ibid., (p.376)</ref></small>

The museum also gained international prominence with the hugely successful and now famous [[Picasso]] retrospective of 1939<U+2013>40, held in conjunction with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. In its range of presented works, it represented a significant reinterpretation of Picasso for future art scholars and historians. This was wholly masterminded by Barr, a Picasso enthusiast, and the exhibition lionized Picasso as the greatest artist of the time, setting the model for all the museum's retrospectives that were to follow.<small><ref>MoMA's international prominence through the Picasso retrospective of 1939<U+2013>40 <U+2013> see FitzGerald, op.cit. (pp.243<U+2013>62)</ref></small>

When Abby Rockefeller's son [[Nelson Rockefeller|Nelson]] was selected by the board of trustees to become its flamboyant president in 1939, at the age of thirty, he became the prime instigator and funder of its publicity, acquisitions and subsequent expansion into new headquarters on 53rd Street. His brother, [[David Rockefeller]], also joined the museum's board of trustees in 1948 and took over the presidency when Nelson was elected Governor of New York in 1958.

David subsequently employed the noted architect [[Philip Johnson]] to redesign the museum garden and name it in honor of his mother, the '''Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden'''. He and the [[Rockefeller family]] in general have retained a close association with the museum throughout its history, with the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] funding the institution since 1947. Both [[David Rockefeller, Jr.]] and [[Sharon Percy Rockefeller]] (wife of Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]]) currently sit on the board of trustees.
In 1937, MoMA had shifted to offices and basement galleries in the [[Time-Life Building]] in [[Rockefeller Center]]. Its permanent and current home, now renovated, designed in the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] by the [[modernist]] architects Philip Goodwin and [[Edward Durell Stone]], opened to the public on May 10, 1939, attended by an illustrious company of 6,000 people, and with an opening address via radio from the White House by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<small><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761401,00.html Time Magazine. 1939: The formal opening of MoMA]</ref></small>. 
On April 15, 1958, a fire on the second floor destroyed an 18 foot long Monet Water Lilies painting (the current Monet water lilies was acquired shortly after the fire as a a replacement).  The fire started when workmen installing air conditioning near paint cans, sawdust, and a canvas dropcloth.  One worker was killed in the fire and several firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation. Most of the paintings on the floor had been moved for the construction although large painting including the Monet were left.  Art work on the 3rd and 4th floors were evacuated to the [[Whitney Museum]] which abutted it on the 54th Street side.  Among the paintings that were moved was [[Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]] which had been on loan by the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].  Visitors and employees above the fire were evacuated to the roof and then jumped to the roof an adjoining townhouse.<ref>http://greg.org/archive/2010/09/02/moma_on_fire.html</ref>

In 1997 the Japanese architect [[Yoshio Taniguchi]] beat out ten other international architects to win the competition to execute the redesign of the museum, which after being closed in Manhattan for a time during the process (a temporary space was opened in [[Long Island City]], [[Queens]]) reopened in 2004.
''Wish Tree'', [[Yoko Ono]]'s installation in the Sculpture Garden (since July 2010), has become very popular with contributions from all over the world.

===Film===
In 1932, museum founder Alfred Barr stressed the importance of introducing "the only great art form peculiar to the twentieth century" to "the American public which should appreciate good films and support them." Museum Trustee and film producer [[John Hay Whitney]] became the first chairman of the Museum's Film Library from 1935 to 1951. The collection Whitney assembled with the help of film curator [[Iris Barry]] was so successful that in 1937 the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences commended the Museum with an award "for its significant work in collecting films . . . and for the first time making available to the public the means of studying the historical and aesthetic development of the motion picture as one of the major arts."<ref>{{cite web|title=History of MoMA Film Collection|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/filmpreservation#historypreservcenter|accessdate=13 October 2012}}</ref>  

The exiled film scholar [[Siegfried Kracauer]] worked at the MoMA film archive on a psychological history of German film between 1941 and 1943. The result of his study, ''[[From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film]]'' (1947), traces the birth of [[Nazism]] from the cinema of the [[Weimar Republic]] and helped lay the foundation of modern [[film criticism]]. 

Under the [[Museum of Modern Art Department of Film]], the film collection includes more than 25,000 titles and ranks as one of the world's finest museum archives of international film art. The department owns prints of many familiar feature-length movies, including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', but its holdings also contains many less-traditional pieces, including [[Andy Warhol]]'s eight-hour ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'', various TV commercials, and [[Chris Cunningham]]'s music video for [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]]'s ''[[All Is Full of Love]]''.

===Architecture and Design===
{{see also|List of works in Museum of Modern Art Department of Architecture and Design}}
MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design was founded in 1932<ref name="Arch Record">[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2011/11/MoMAs-Architecture-Dept.asp Broome, Beth: ''A Landmark Acquisition for MoMA<U+2019>s Architecture and Design Department''] in the Architectural Record, 4 November 2011</ref> as the first museum department in the world dedicated to the intersection of architecture and design.<ref name="MoMA Arch">[http://www.moma.org/explore/collection/architecture_design MoMA: Architecture and Design], retrieved 30 November 2011</ref> The department's first director was [[Philip Johnson]] who served as curator between 1932<U+2013>34 and 1946-54.<ref>[http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/PJohnsonPapersf MOMA: ''Philip Johnson Papers in The Museum of Modern Art Archives'', 1995]</ref> 

The collection consists of 28,000 works including architectural models, drawings and photographs.<ref name="Arch Record"/> One of the highlights of the collection is the [[Mies van der Rohe]] Archive.<ref name="MoMA Arch"/> It also includes works from such legendary designers as [[Paul L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3>]], the [[Charles and Ray Eames|Eameses]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], and [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]]. The design collection contains many industrial and manufactured pieces, ranging from a self-aligning [[ball bearing]] to an entire [[Bell 47|Bell 47D1 helicopter]]. In 2012, the department acquired a selection of 14 [[video games]], the basis of an intended collection of 40 which is to range from ''[[Spacewar!]]'' (1962) to ''[[Minecraft]]'' (2011).<ref>{{cite web|last=Antonelli|first=Paola|title=Video Games: 14 in the Collection, for Starters|url=http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2012/11/29/video-games-14-in-the-collection-for-starters|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=29 November 2012}}</ref>

== Renovation ==
MoMA's midtown location underwent extensive renovations in the early 2000s, closing on May 21, 2002 and reopening to the public in a building redesigned by the [[Japan]]ese [[architect]] [[Yoshio Taniguchi]] along with [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]], on November 20, 2004. From June 29, 2002 until September 27, 2004, a portion of its collection was on display in what was dubbed ''MoMA QNS'', a former [[Swingline]] staple factory in [[Long Island City]], [[Queens]].

The expansion, including an increase in MoMA<U+2019>s endowment to cover operating expenses, cost $858 million in total.<ref>Carol Vogel (January 3, 2007), [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/arts/design/03muse.html  MoMA to Gain Exhibition Space by Selling Adjacent Lot for $125 Million] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref> The project nearly doubled the space for MoMA's exhibitions and programs and features {{convert|630000|sqft|m2}} of new and redesigned space. The ''Peggy and David Rockefeller Building'' on the western portion of the site houses the main exhibition galleries, and ''The Lewis B. and Dorothy Cullman Education and Research Building'' on the eastern portion provides over five times more space for classrooms, auditoriums, teacher training workshops, and the museum's expanded Library and Archives. These two buildings frame the enlarged ''Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden.''

The architecture of the renovation is controversial. At its opening, some critics thought that Taniguchi's design was a fine example of contemporary architecture, while many others were extremely displeased with certain aspects of the design, such as the flow of the space.<ref>{{cite web|last=Updike|first=John|title=Invisible Cathedral|accessdate=2010-12-12|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2004-11-15|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/11/15/041115crat_atlarge?currentPage=all|quote=Nothing in the new building is obtrusive, nothing is cheap.

Museum of Modern Art is selling its last vacant parcel of land in Midtown for $125 million to Hines, an international real estate developer based in Houston.

==Management==

===Attendance===
MoMA has seen its average number of visitors rise to 2.5 million from about 1.5 million a year before its new granite and glass renovation. In 2009, the museum reported 119,000 members and 2.8 million visitors over the previous fiscal year.<ref>[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/33397/with-endowment-drop-moma-freezes-wages/ With Endowment Drop, MoMA Freezes Wages] ''[[ARTINFO]]'', December 8, 2009.</ref> MoMA attracted its highest-ever number of visitors, 3.09 million, during its 2010 fiscal year;<ref>Erica Orden (June 29, 2010), [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703964104575335301840480246.html MoMA Attendance Hits Record High] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> however, attendance dropped 11 percent to 2.8 million in 2011.<ref>Philip Boroff (January 12, 2012), [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-12/moma-attendance-falls-met-museum-rises-driven-by-blockbusters.html MoMA Visitors Fall, Met Museum<U+2019>s Rise, Led by Blockbusters] ''[[Bloomberg]]''.</ref>

The museum was open every day since its founding in 1929, until 1975, when it closed one day a week (originally Wednesdays) to reduce operating expenses. In 2012, it again opened every day, including Tuesday, the one day it has traditionally been closed.<ref>Carol Vogel (September 25, 2012), [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/arts/design/museum-of-modern-art-plans-to-be-open-every-day.html MoMA Plans to Be Open Every Day] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

===Admission===
MoMA's reopening brought controversy as its admission cost increased from US$12 to US$20, making it one of the most expensive museums in the city; however it has free entry on Fridays after 4pm, thanks to sponsorship from [[Target Stores]]. Also, many New York area college students receive free admission to the museum. As of October, 2012, admission fees for MoMA at its Midtown Manhattan location are as follows: Adults $25. Seniors (65 and over with ID) $18. Students (full-time with current ID) $14. Children (16 and under) Free (note that this policy does '''not''' apply to children in groups). Members, Free. Guests of Members, $5 (limit of five per visit).

===Finances===
A private non-profit organization, MoMA is the seventh-largest U.S. museum by budget;<ref name="bloomberg.com">Philip Borof (August 10, 2009), [http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=ag20MDxuqAko Museum of Modern Art<U+2019>s Lowry Earned $1.32 Million in 2008-2009] ''[[Bloomberg]]''.</ref> its annual revenue is about $145 million (none of which is profit). In 2011, the museum reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of just over $1 billion.<ref>Shane Ferro (July 25, 2012), [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/815198/as-mocas-money-woes-simmer-a-look-at-how-major-museums-finances-work As MOCA's Money Woes Simmer, A Look at How Major Museums' Finances Work] ''ARTINFO''.</ref>

Unlike most museums, the museum eschews government funding, instead subsisting on a fragmented budget with a half-dozen different sources of income, none larger than a fifth.<ref name="A Museum">Arianne Cohen (June 3, 2007), [http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/profit/32904/ A Museum] ''[[New York Magazine]]''.</ref> Before the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|economic crisis of late 2008]], the MoMA<U+2019>s board of trustees decided to sell its equities in order to move into an all-cash position.<ref>[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/31167/cashing-out/ "Cashing Out."] May 2009, ''[[Art & Auction|Art+Auction]].''</ref> An $858 million capital campaign funded the 2002-2004 expansion,<ref name="bloomberg.com"/> with [[David Rockefeller]] donating $77 million in cash.

The agency noted that MoMA has "superior financial flexibility with over $332 million of unrestricted financial resources," and has had solid attendance and record sales at its retail outlets around the city and online. Some of the challenges that Moody's noted were the reliance that the museum has on the tourist industry in New York for its operating revenue, and a large amount of debt. The museum at the time had a 2.4 debt-to-operating revenues ratio, but it was also noted that MoMA intended to retire $370 million worth of debt in the next few years.<ref>Shane Ferro (August 17, 2011), [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/38368/what-moodys-thinks-of-moma-analyzing-the-top-5-credit-ratings-for-art-museums/ What Moody's Thinks of MoMA: Analyzing the Top 5 Credit Ratings for Art Museums] ''ARTINFO''.</ref> [[Standard & Poor<U+2019>s]] raised its long-term rating for the museum as it benefited from the fundraising of its trustees.<ref>Katya Kazakina (April 11, 2012), [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-11/s-p-raises-museum-of-modern-art-s-debt-rating-on-management.html S&P Raises Museum of Modern Art<U+2019>s Debt Rating on Management] ''[[Bloomberg]]''.</ref> After construction expenses for the new galleries are covered, the Modern estimates that some $65 million will go to its $650 million endowment.

==Officers and the Board of Trustees==
Currently, the Board of Trustees includes 42 trustees and 15 life trustees. Even including the board's 14 "honorary" trustees, who do not have voting rights and do not play as direct a role in the museum, this amounts to an average individual contribution of more than $7 million.<ref name="nytimes.com"/> The Founders Wall was created in 2004, when MoMA<U+2019>s expansion was completed, and features the names of actual founders in addition to those who gave significant gifts; about a half-dozen names have been added since 2004. For example, [[Ileana Sonnabend]]'s name was added in 2012, even though she was only 15 when the museum was established in 1929.<ref>Patricia Cohen (November 28, 2012), [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/arts/design/moma-gains-treasure-that-metropolitan-museum-of-art-also-coveted.html MoMA Gains Treasure That Met Also Coveted] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

==Controversies==
In 1969 the [[Art Workers Coalition]] (AWC), a group of New York City artists who opposed the [[Vietnam War]], in collaboration with Museum of Modern Art members [[Arthur Drexler]] and [[Elizabeth Shaw (moma)|Elizabeth Shaw]],<ref name=holsinger>M. Paul Holsinger, "And Babies" in [http://books.google.com/books?id=Oe4AOVHkJ9oC&pg=PA363 ''War and American Popular Culture''], Greenwood Press, 1999, pg. 363</ref> created an iconic protest poster called ''[[And babies]]'' which depicts US soldiers as "baby killers." The poster uses an image by photojournalist [[Ronald L. Haeberle]] and references the [[My Lai Massacre]]. The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) had promised to fund and circulate the poster, but after seeing the 2 by 3 foot poster MoMA pulled financing for the project at the last minute.<ref name=frascina/><ref name=selz>Peter Howard Selz, Susan Landauer. [http://books.google.com/books?id=nBIM6iKsaoEC&pg=PT37 ''Art of engagement: visual politics in California and beyond''], pg. 46.</ref> MoMA's Board of Trustees included [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William S. Paley]] (head of CBS), who reportedly "hit the ceiling" on seeing the proofs of the poster.<ref name=frascina/> Both were "firm supporters" of the war effort and backed the Nixon administration.<ref name=frascina/> It is unclear if they pulled out for political reasons (as pro-war supporters), or simply to avoid a scandal (personally and/or for MoMA), but the official reason, stated in a press release, was that the poster was outside the "function" of the museum.<ref name=frascina>Francis Frascina. [http://books.google.com/books?id=QTq8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA175 ''Art, politics, and dissent: aspects of the art left in sixties America''], pgs. 175-186+ discuss the creation of the poster.</ref> Nevertheless, under the sole sponsorship of the AWC, 50,000 posters were printed by New York City's lithographers union. On December 26, 1969, a grassroots network of volunteer artists, students and peace activists began circulating it worldwide.<ref name=frascina/><ref name=selz/> Many newspapers and television shows re-printed images of the poster, consumer poster versions soon followed, and it was carried in protest marches around the world, all further increasing its viewership. In a further protest of MoMA's decision to pull out of the project, copies of the poster were carried by members of the AWC into the MoMA and unfurled in front of Picasso's painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (on loan to MoMA at the time) the painting depicts the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon innocent civilians.<ref name=frascina/> The poster was included shortly thereafter in MoMA's ''Information'' exhibition of July 2 to September 20, 1970, curated by Kynaston McShine.<ref>Kenneth R.
