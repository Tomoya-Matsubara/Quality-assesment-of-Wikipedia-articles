'''Henry Martyn''' (18 February 1781 <U+2013> 16 October 1812) was an [[Anglican]] priest and [[missionary]] to the peoples of [[British Raj|India]] and [[Qajar dynasty|Persia]]. Born in [[Truro, Cornwall|Truro]], [[Cornwall]], he was educated at [[Truro Grammar School]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Venn|id=MRTN797H|name=Martyn, Henry}}</ref> A chance encounter with [[Charles Simeon]] led him to become a missionary. He was ordained a priest in the [[Church of England]] and became a chaplain for the [[British East India Company]]. 

Martyn arrived in India in April 1806, where he preached and occupied himself in the study of linguistics. He translated the whole of the [[New Testament]] into [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and Judaeo-Persic. He also translated the [[Psalms]] into Persian and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Urdu. From India, he set out for [[Bushire]], [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]], [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], and [[Tabriz]].

Martyn was seized with fever, and, though the plague was raging at [[Tokat]], he was forced to stop there, unable to continue. On [[16 October]] [[1812]] he died. He was remembered for his courage, selflessness and his religious devotion. In parts of the [[Anglican Communion]] he is celebrated with a [[Lesser Festival (Church of England)|Lesser Festival]] on [[19 October]].

==Early life==
Martyn was born in [[Truro, Cornwall|Truro]], [[Cornwall]]. His father, John Martyn, was a "captain" or mine-agent at [[Gwennap]]. As a boy, he was educated at Truro grammar school under Dr Cardew and he entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in the autumn of 1797, and was [[Senior Wrangler|senior wrangler]] and first Smith's prizeman in 1801. In 1802, he was chosen as a fellow of his college.<ref name="ODCC">{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = F. L. Cross (Editor), E. A.

He had intended to go to the bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear [[Charles Simeon]] speaking of the good done in India by a single [[Mission (Christian)|missionary]], [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], and some time afterwards he read the life of [[David Brainerd]], a missionary to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On [[22 October]] [[1803]], he was ordained deacon at [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of [[Lolworth]].<ref name="ODCC" />

==Missionary work==
Martyn wanted to offer his services to the [[Church Missionary Society]], when a financial disaster in Cornwall deprived him and his unmarried sister of the income  their father had left for them. It was necessary for Martyn to earn an income that would support his sister as well as himself.<ref name="DNB">{{cite book | last =Lee | first =Sidney | authorlink = | coauthors =  | title =The Dictionary of National Biography | publisher =Oxford University Press | date =1909 | location = | pages = | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=Cys8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1201&lpg=PA1201&dq=1803+cornwall+disaster+martyn&source=web&ots=14phJb9ZDd&sig=GlZD7qvRusOrt3YNEEgiYTxr1Mo&hl=en | doi = | id =  | isbn = }}</ref>  He accordingly obtained a chaplaincy under the [[British East India Company]] and left for [[British Raj|India]] on [[5 July]] [[1805]].<ref name="ODCC" /> On his voyage to the East, Martyn happened to be present at the [[British Empire|British]] [[Battle of Blaauwberg|conquest]] of the [[Cape Colony]] on [[8 January]] [[1806]]. He spent that day tending to the dying soldiers and was distressed by seeing the horrors of war. He would come away feeling that it was Britain's destiny to convert, not colonize, the world.<ref name="OIHC">(1990) McManners, John. ''Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity''. Oxford University Press, 457. ISBN 0-19-822928-3</ref> He wrote in his diary:

{{cquote|I prayed that<U+2026>[[England]] whilst she sent the thunder of her arms to distant regions of the globe, might not remain proud and ungodly at home; but might show herself great indeed, by sending forth the ministers of her church to diffuse the gospel of peace.<ref name="OIHC" />}}

===India===
Martyn arrived in India in April 1806, and for some months he was stationed at Aldeen, near [[Serampur]]. In October 1806, he proceeded to [[Danapur|Dinapur]], where he was soon able to conduct worship among the locals in the vernacular, and established schools.<ref name="let">(1837) [[Samuel Wilberforce|Wilberforce, Samuel]] (ed.). [http://justus.anglican.org/resources/pc/india/martyn/journal.html ''Journal and Letters of the Rev. Henry Martyn B.D.'']. London: Seeley and Burnside.</ref> In April 1809, he was transferred to [[Cawnpore]], where he preached to British and Indians in his own compound, in spite of interruptions and threats from local non-Christians.<ref name="DNB" />

He occupied himself in linguistic study, and had already, during his residence at Dinapur, been engaged in revising the sheets of his [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] version of the [[New Testament]]. He now translated the whole of the New Testament into [[Urdu]] also, and into [[Persian language|Persian]] twice. He translated the [[Psalms]] into Persian, the Gospels into Judaeo-Persic, and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] into Urdu, in spite of ill-health and "the pride, pedantry and fury of his chief munshi Sabat."<ref name="EB1911" /> Ordered by the doctors to take a sea voyage, he obtained leave to go to Persia and correct his Persian New Testament. From there, he wanted to go to [[Arabia]], and there compose an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] version.<ref name="ODCC" /> On [[1 October]] [[1810]], having seen his work at Cawnpore rewarded on the previous day by the opening of a church, he left for [[Calcutta]], from where he sailed on [[7 January]] [[1811]] for [[Bombay]]. The ship reached port on his thirtieth birthday.<ref name="let" />

==Final voyage and death==
From Bombay he set out for [[Bushire]], bearing letters from [[John Malcolm|Sir John Malcolm]] to men of position there, as also at [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. After an exhausting journey from the coast he reached Shiraz, and was soon plunged into discussion with the disputants of all classes, "Sufi, Muslim, Jew, and Jewish Muslim, even Armenian, all anxious to test their powers of argument with the first English priest who had visited them."<ref name="EB1911">{{1911}}</ref> He next traveled to [[Tabriz]] to attempt to present the [[Shah]] with his translation of the New Testament, which proved unsuccessful. Sir [[Gore Ouseley]], the British ambassador to the Shah, was unable to bring about a meeting, but did deliver the manuscript. Although Martyn could not present the Bible in person, the Shah later wrote him a letter:

{{cquote|In truth (said the royal letter of thanks to the ambassador) through the learned and unremitted exertions of the Reverend Henry Martyn it has been translated in a style most befitting sacred books, that is in an easy and simple diction...The whole of the New Testament is completed in a most excellent manner, a source of pleasure to our enlightened and august mind.<ref name="cp">{{cite book | last =Padwick | first =Constance | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Henry Martyn, Confessor of the Faith
 | publisher =Inter-Varsity Fellowship | date =1953 | location =London  | pages =172 | url = | doi = | id =  | isbn = }}</ref>}} 

At this time, he was seized with fever, and after a temporary recovery, had to seek a change of climate. He set off for [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], where he intended to return on furlough to England to regain his strength and recruit help for the missions in India.<ref name="DNB" /> On [[12 September]] [[1812]], he started with two [[Armenia]]n servants and crossed the [[Aras River]]. Urged on from place to place by their  [[Tatar]] guide, they rode from Tabriz to [[Yerevan|Erivan]], from Erivan to [[Kars, Turkey|Kars]], and from Kars to [[Erzurum]]. They departed Erzurum and though the plague was raging at [[Tokat]], he was forced to stop there, unable to continue. He wrote his final journal entry on 6 October. It read, in part:

{{cquote|Oh! when shall time give place to eternity? When shall appear that new heaven and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness? There, there shall in no wise enter in any thing that defileth: none of that wickedness which has made men worse than wild beasts, none of those corruptions which add still more to the miseries of mortality, shall be seen or heard of any more.<ref name="let" />}}

On [[16 October]] [[1812]] he died and was given a [[Christian burial]] by [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian clergy]].<ref name="ODCC" />

== Legacy ==
His devotion to his tasks won him much admiration in Great Britain and he was the hero of a number of literary publications.<ref name="ODCC" /> [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]]'s ''Epitaph'', composed early in 1813, testified to the impression made by his career:

{{cquote|Epitaph on Henry Martyn

<br>  Here Martyn lies. In Manhood's early bloom
<br>  The Christian Hero finds a Pagan tomb.
<br>  Religion, sorrowing o'er her favourite son,
<br>  Points to the glorious trophies that he won.
<br>  Eternal trophies! not with carnage red,
<br>  Not stained with tears by hapless captives shed,
<br>  But trophies of the Cross! for that dear name,
<br>  Through every form of danger, death, and shame,
<br>  Onward he journeyed to a happier shore,
<br>  Where danger, death, and shame assault no more.
