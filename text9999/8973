"'''The Night of the Meek'''" is the December 23, 1960 episode of the American television [[anthology series]] ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.

==Synopsis==
It's [[Christmas Eve]]. Henry Corwin, a down-and-out ne'er-do-well, wearing a worn-out Santa Claus suit, has just spent his last few dollars on six drinks at Jack's Place, the neighborhood bar. Bruce, the brusque bartender, throws him out after spotting Corwin, now low on funds, reaching for the bottle. Arriving an hour late for his seasonal job as a department store Santa, the visibly-drunk Corwin is soon fired by Mr. Dundee, the mean-spirited manager, acting on a complaint from the rude customer who pushed her ill-behaved son to sit on Santa's lap. As Dundee orders him to leave the premises, Corwin pours out his heartache over living in a "dirty rooming house on a street filled with hungry kids and shabby people" for whom he is unable to fulfill his desired role as Santa. He declares that if he had just ''one'' wish granted him on Christmas Eve- "I'd like to see the meek inherit the earth".  Still in his outfit, he returns to Jack's Place, but is refused re-entry by Bruce who explains to the inebriated patrons that "Santa's a lush".

Stumbling aimlessly into an alley, he hears sleigh bells and trips over a large burlap bag, which at first appears to be full of empty tin cans, but looking back, Corwin sees the bag overfull with packages, and the bag now has the ability to produce any item that's asked of it. Suffused with the spirit of Christmas, Corwin proceeds to hand out gift-wrapped presents to passersby and then, entering Sister Florence's "[[Delancey Street]] Mission House", to derelict men attending the Christmas Eve service. Irritated at this interruption, Sister Florence goes outside to fetch Officer Flaherty who proceeds to arrest Corwin for apparently stealing merchandise from his former place of employment.  Flaherty then contacts Mr. Dundee, who arrives at the police station, exclaiming, "Ah-ha, here he is, and here we are, and there that is!". Calling Corwin a "moth-eaten [[Robin Hood]]", Dundee reaches into the garbage bag to display some of the purported "wholesale theft of thousands of dollars worth of goods", but all he manages to pull out are a couple of empty cans and a meowing stray cat, as Corwin tries to explain that the bag "doesn't know whether to give out gifts or garbage". Realizing he can't hold Corwin for possession of "garbage", Flaherty tells him, over Dundee's objections, that he can leave.

As Flaherty murmurs to Dundee that "we're dealing with the supernatural here", Corwin reaches into the bag and gives Dundee the Christmas present that he sarcastically challenged Corwin to produce, a bottle of [[cherry brandy]], [[vintage]] 1903. Leaving the precinct, he continues to hand out gifts for the remainder of the evening, until the bag is empty. Burt, an elderly local resident who had already received a couple of Corwin's presents, points out that Corwin has taken "not a thing" for himself. Corwin replies that his only wish is to do this every year. Returning to the alley where he found the bag, he encounters a young female elf, sleigh and four reindeer waiting to take him to his destiny as the eternal Santa Claus.

Emerging from the precinct, Flaherty and Dundee, now slightly tipsy from sampling the brandy, hear the tinkle of bells and confirm to each other that they have, indeed, just seen Henry Corwin, in a sleigh with reindeer and an elf, ascend into the night sky on Christmas Eve. Dundee invites Flaherty to accompany him home and share some hot coffee and more brandy, adding, "...and we'll thank God for ''miracles'', Flaherty..."

==Episode notes==
By November 1960, ''The Twilight Zone'''s second season had already broadcast five episodes and finished filming sixteen. However, at a cost of about $65,000 per episode, the show was exceeding its budget. As a result, six consecutive episodes were videotaped and subsequently transferred to 16-millimeter film for TV transmission and future syndicated rebroadcasts. Total savings on editing and cinematography costs amounted to only about $30,000 for all six entries <U+2014> not enough to justify the loss of depth of visual perspective, which gave those shows an appearance akin to that of stagebound live TV dramas, or even [[soap operas]]. The experiment was therefore deemed a failure and never attempted again.

Even though the six episodes were recorded in a row, through November and into mid-December, their broadcast dates were out of order and varied widely, with this, the fourth one, shown on December 23, 1960 as second season episode 11. The first, "[[The Lateness of the Hour]]", was seen on December 2, 1960 as episode 8; The second, "[[Static (The Twilight Zone)|Static]]", was shown on March 10, 1961 as episode 20; the third, "[[The Whole Truth (The Twilight Zone)|The Whole Truth]]", appeared on January 20, 1961 as episode 14; the fifth, "[[Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)|Twenty Two]]", was seen on February 10, 1961 as episode 17; and the last one, "[[Long Distance Call]]", was transmitted on March 3, 1961 as episode 22.

==Personnel and cast with multiple ''Twilight Zone'' credits== 
*[[Jack Smight]] (1925<U+2013>2003), a director of numerous TV episodes, [[Television movie|made-for-TV movie]]s and theatrical films, helmed four ''Twilight Zone'' episodes, including three of the six videotaped ones, the other two being "[[The Lateness of the Hour]]" and "[[Twenty Two (The Twilight Zone)|Twenty Two]]".  His initial assignment was "[[The Lonely (The Twilight Zone)|The Lonely]]" which, shown as the seventh episode of the first season, was the first regularly-filmed installment after the pilot episode.

*A character star, [[Art Carney]] (1918<U+2013>2003) later appeared as Santa Claus in [[CBS]]' December 1970 hour-long [[Muppet]] special, ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'', and in [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s December 1984 [[television film]], ''[[The Night They Saved Christmas]]''.  Best remembered by TV viewers in 1960 as [[Jackie Gleason]]'s sidekick on Gleason's various 1950s comedy/variety shows, including ''[[The Honeymooners]]''' "Ed Norton", it was Carney who received the honors <U+2014> six [[Emmy Award|Emmies]] and a [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] (for 1974's ''[[Harry and Tonto]]'') <U+2014> to Gleason's none. This was Carney's only ''Twilight Zone'' appearance but, nearly two years earlier, on January 22, 1959, he starred in Rod Serling's semi-autobiographical story, "The Velvet Alley", the eighth of ten Serling teleplays featured on ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', the most prestigious of the many live drama anthology series from the [[Golden Age of Television]]. Carney's role, that of an aspiring writer who sells his first teleplay to a major TV drama series, paralleled Serling's own career. As in Serling's 1963 screenplay for the political thriller, ''[[Seven Days in May]]'', in which a highly moral minor character is named Art Corwin, the appellation of Carney's "Night of the Meek" character, Henry Corwin, was a tribute to Serling's idol, legendary television, film and, most memorably for Serling, radio writer [[Norman Corwin]] whose lengthy career, in contrast to Serling's relatively brief 50-year lifetime, has spanned over seven decades. On May 3, 2010, Corwin celebrated his 100th birthday. 

*Busy character actor [[John Fiedler]] (1925<U+2013>2005) played usually bald and bespectacled officious types in hundreds of radio shows, TV episodes and movies starting in the 1940s. Appearing on TV from its earliest days, he was one of the cadets in ''[[Tom Corbett, Space Cadet]]'' from 1951 to 1954, had regular roles in three series between 1973 and 1984 and did countless cartoon voices, including that of [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]. His other ''Twilight Zone'' part, as a bureaucratic angel (without spectacles), was in third season's penultimate episode, "[[Cavender Is Coming]]", a failed [[sitcom]] pilot replete with a [[laugh track]].

*A unique character, [[Burt Mustin]] (1884<U+2013>1977) was a retired car salesman who began acting in films and television in 1951, at the age of 67, and continued as a performer for the next twenty-six years, dying eleven days short of his ninety-third birthday. Here, he's an elderly denizen of skid row, whom Corwin addresses as "Burt" and presents with a pipe and, as a follow-up, with a smoking jacket, while, in his other ''Twilight Zone'' appearance, he's again typecast, playing one of the residents of the old-age home in third season's "[[Kick the Can]]".

*Child actress Andrea Margolis (born 1952) appeared in over a dozen TV episodes starting unbilled with this, her first role, and, billed as Andrea Darvi (from 1962 onward), continued for six years, until her last performance in a 1966 installment of ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]''.  She subsequently became a journalist as well as a social worker and discusses "The Night of the Meek" at length in her partially autobiographical book about child actors, ''Pretty Babies'', published in 1983 by [[McGraw-Hill]].  Her other ''Twilight Zone'' appearance was in the next episode, "[[Dust (The Twilight Zone)|Dust]]", in which she plays Estrelita, a little [[Mexican people|Mexican]] girl, helping her father to plead for the life of her condemned brother.

*Attractive blonde Nan Peterson (born 1939) played mainly decorative parts in some twenty TV shows and four films during a five-year period between 1959 and 1964. She was the title character in the poverty-budgeted 1959 independent ''Louisiana Hussy'' and is remembered by specialized genre fans as one of the two female leads in two other small-scale productions, 1959's ''[[The Hideous Sun Demon]]'' and 1963's [[Ed Wood]]-scripted ''Shotgun Wedding''. Her four ''Twilight Zone'' appearances, in which she barely utters a couple of words, are spread between the beginning and the end of her brief career. Here, she is little more than an extra, sitting at the bar in Jack's Place, next to a drunk whose sleeping face is in foreground, turned towards the camera. Her debut performance, as the mother who calls out to her merry-go-round-riding child, can be seen in first season's memorable fifth episode "[[Walking Distance]]", and her second, the most prominent of the four, in the episode videotaped immediately before this one, "[[The Whole Truth (The Twilight Zone)|The Whole Truth]]", where she and [[Jack Ging]] play a newly-married couple considering the purchase of one of the substandard vehicles in the lot of used-car dealer [[Jack Carson]]. Her final acting role, a bit part as a secretary, was three years later, in February 1964's fifth season installment, "[[From Agnes<U+2014>With Love]]", in which, as here, she is unbilled.
