(2011). Annual Report (p.8) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> ENMAX<U+2019>s core operations include electricity generation, transmission and distribution and the sale of electricity  natural gas and renewable energy products to residential, commercial and institutional customers in Alberta.

==History==
In 1904, The City of Calgary built its own electric plant. The City of Calgary Electric System (later to become ENMAX Corporation) began operating on December 2, 1905.<ref>Howkins, W.E. Electrifying Calgary. Calgary. The University of Calgary Press, 1987. p. 73.</ref> In 1996, City Council approved a proposal to make The City of Calgary Electric System a wholly owned subsidiary commencing on January 1, 1998. This subsidiary was called "ENMAX Corporation"; an affiliated retailer, "ENMAX Energy", was incorporated on January 1, 1998. Then on January 1, 2001, ENMAX Energy entered the restructured, deregulated electric marketplace in Alberta.<ref>ENMAX Corp. Alberta's Evolving Electricity Industry 17 June 2010. Retrieved 15 February 2011. http://www.enmax.com/Corporation/About+Enmax/Alberta+ Electricity+Industry+and+ENMAX/Deregulation/default.htm </ref>

==ENMAX Energy Generation==

ENMAX Energy<U+2019>s electricity is supplied through a combination of long-term contracts, namely power purchase agreements (PPAs), ownership of generation facilities and through purchases from the Alberta electricity market. Natural gas is supplied by purchases in Alberta's natural gas market. Current operating facilities include the Crossfield Energy Centre, Calgary Energy Centre and the Downtown District Energy Centre.  ENMAX Energy<U+2019>s owned generation also includes 100 per cent ownership of the 80 MW Taber wind farm and 63 MW Kettles Hill wind farm, and a 50 per cent interest in the 75 MW McBride Lake wind farm, all located in southern Alberta. The company continues to receive significant supply from their power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the Keephills and Battle River coal-fired facilities.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.19) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> 

ENMAX Energy continues to apply fresh approaches to producing energy by locating natural gas-fired power generation facilities close to where electricity is required.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.21) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> The company is in the initial building phase of the Shepard Energy Centre, an 800 megawatt (MW) combined-cycle facility, and has received regulatory approval for the Bonnybrook Energy Centre, a 165 MW cogeneration facility.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.19) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref>

==District Energy Centre==

The Calgary Downtown District Energy Centre began operations in March 2010, capable of providing heat for up to 10 million square feet of buildings. The facility incorporates high efficiency boilers fueled by natural gas. District Energy is more efficient, has fewer emissions and is more cost-effective than conventional heating systems.  Customers are connected to the facility through an underground thermal distribution system, which occupies significantly less space than a traditional heating system.<ref>http://www.enmax.com/Corporation/Clean+Power/Generation+Facilities/District+Energy/Calgary+District+Energy+Centre.htm</ref>

==Shepard Energy Centre==

The Shepard Energy Centre will use advanced technology and innovative approaches, producing less than half the carbon dioxide CO2 per MW than a conventional coal plant. It will also emit less other emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.21) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> Shepard will provide substantial input into Alberta<U+2019>s power grid and will increase reliability, reducing stress on the Alberta-wide transmission infrastructure. The Shepard Energy Centre be the largest facility of its kind in Alberta, being one of the most modern and efficient facilities in the province. It will become operational in 2015.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.22) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> 

==Bonnybrook Energy Centre==

The Bonnybrook Energy Centre is a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility that will be built in Calgary<U+2019>s southeast industrial zone. Once built, Bonnybrook will generate 165 MW of electricity, which is approximately half of downtown Calgary<U+2019>s energy requirements.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.24) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> This facility will reduce the amount of fresh water used by reusing industrial wastewater from the nearby Canada malting site and will play an integral role in heating office buildings in downtown Calgary. Bonnybrook will emit less than half of the carbon dioxide associated with conventional coal-fired facilities and will enhance the reliability of the region<U+2019>s power supply.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.24) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref>

==Generate Choice==

In 2011, ENMAX Energy launched its Generate Choice, a program which offers Albertans home-based renewable energy choices such as solar power and wind generation.<ref>ENMAX Corp. (2011). Annual Report (p.7 ) Retrieved from http://www.enmax.com/NR/rdonlyres/4193A82A-67A9-40A5-A842-EEDEA7283ABB/0/2011_annual_report.pdf</ref> Response to the program has been outstanding: over 3,100 people expressed interest in having a solar photo-voltaic (PV) system installed and since August 2011, 172 solar PV systems were installed.  

In June 2012, Brian Keating{{who|date=July 2012}}, one of Calgary<U+2019>s best known naturalists, became the 100th Calgary homeowner to join in the program. <U+201C>Through a lease program, the panels generate a portion of a home<U+2019>s energy needs. A set of six panels is a 1.3 kilowatt-hour photovoltaic system that will produce between 1,000 and 1,400 kWh per year. The average home in Calgary uses 625 kWh per month,<U+201D> says Colin Dumais, technology specialist with ENMAX<U+201D>.<ref>http://www.calgaryherald.com/technology/Naturalist+harnesses+rays/6715503/story.html#ixzz1xtfAyAGu</ref>
