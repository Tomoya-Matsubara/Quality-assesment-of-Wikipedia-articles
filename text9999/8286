The '''first-move advantage in chess''' is the inherent advantage of the player (called [[White and Black in chess|White]]) who makes the first move in [[chess]]. Chess players and [[Chess theory|theorists]] generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. [[Statistics]] compiled since 1851 support this view, showing that White consistently [[List of chess terms#Win|wins]] slightly more often than [[White and Black in chess|Black]], usually scoring between 52 and 56&nbsp;percent. White's [[List of chess terms#Winning percentage|winning percentage]]<ref>
White's overall winning percentage is calculated by taking the percentage of games won by White plus half the percentage of drawn games. Thus, if out of 100&nbsp;games White wins 40, draws 32, and loses 28, White's total winning percentage is 40 plus half of 32, i.e. 56&nbsp;percent.</ref> is about the same for [[tournament]] games between humans and games between [[computer]]s. However, White's advantage is less significant in [[Fast chess|rapid]] games and in games between weaker players.

Chess players and [[Chess theory|theoreticians]] have long debated whether, given [[Solved game#Perfect play|perfect play]] by both sides, the game should end in a win for White, or a [[draw (chess)|draw]]. <!-- Note to other editors: I have been unable to find any reliable sources for views of leading players before Steinitz. Jerzy Gizycki claims that "Philidor thought ... that whoever made first move and made no mistake would win." Jerzy Gizycki, A History of Chess, The Abbey Library, 1977, p. 106. ISBN 07196-0086-3. However, I have Philidor's book and can't find anything like this. Can anyone find a reliable source for this? --> Since at least 1889, when [[World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] addressed the issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: [[Weaver Adams]] and [[Vsevolod Rauzer]] claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while [[Hans Berliner]] argued that 1.d4 may win for White. It is possible that computers will eventually resolve the debate by determining the correct outcome of a perfectly played game of chess, as they have for [[checkers]].

Some players, including World Champions [[Jos<U+00E9> Ra<U+00FA>l Capablanca]], [[Emanuel Lasker]], and [[Bobby Fischer]], have expressed fears of a "draw death" as chess becomes more deeply analyzed. To alleviate this danger, Capablanca and Fischer both proposed [[chess variant]]s to renew interest in the game, while Lasker suggested changing how draws and [[stalemate]] are scored.

Since 1988, chess theorists have challenged previously well-established views about White's advantage. [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] (GM) [[Andr<U+00E1>s Adorj<U+00E1>n]] wrote a series of books on the theme that "Black is OK!", arguing that the general perception that White has an advantage is founded more in [[psychology]] than reality. GM [[Mihai Suba]] and others contend that sometimes White's [[List of chess terms#Initiative|initiative]] disappears for no apparent reason as a game progresses. The prevalent style of play for Black today is to seek [[List of chess terms#Dynamism|dynamic]], unbalanced positions with active [[List of chess terms#Counterplay|counterplay]], rather than merely trying to [[List of chess terms#Equalise/Equalize|equalize]].

Modern writers also argue that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The consensus that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the White player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Moreover, according to [[game theory]], playing second may be advantageous because White has to reveal his hand first. Some openings are thus considered good for Black but less so for White, because White's extra [[Tempo (chess)|tempo]] allows Black to adjust in advance to the opponent's plans. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where both players make the same moves) can also lead to situations where moving first is a disadvantage, either for psychological or objective reasons.

Two decades later, statistician Arthur M.

More recent sources indicate that White scores approximately 54 to 56 percent. In 2005, GM [[Jonathan Rowson]] wrote that "the conventional wisdom is that White begins the game with a small advantage and, holding all other factors constant, scores approximately 56% to Black's 44%".<ref>Rowson 2005, p. 193.</ref> [[International Master]] (IM) [[John L.

[[New In Chess]] observed in its 2000 Yearbook that of the 731,740&nbsp;games in its database, White scored 54.8% overall; with the two most popular opening moves, White scored 54.1% in 349,855&nbsp;games beginning 1.e4, and 56.1% in 296,200&nbsp;games beginning 1.d4.

[[Statistician]] [[Jeff Sonas]], in examining data from 266,000&nbsp;games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's [[Elo rating]] advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 if it is better than +390, or <U+2212>460 if it is worse than <U+2212>460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35&nbsp;points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in [[fast chess|rapid]] games than in games at a slower ("classical") [[time control]].<ref>{{cite web

Other writers conclude that there is a [[positive correlation]] between the players' ratings and White's score. According to GM [[Evgeny Sveshnikov]], statistics show that White has no advantage over Black in games between beginners, but "if the players are stronger, White has the lead".<ref name="Adorj<U+00E1>n">Adorj<U+00E1>n 2004, p. 69 (statement by Sveshnikov dated May 12, 1994).</ref> An analysis of the results of games in [[ChessBase|ChessBase's]] Mega 2003 database between players with similar Elo ratings, commissioned by GM [[Andr<U+00E1>s Adorj<U+00E1>n]], showed that as the players' ratings went up, the percentage of draws increased, the proportion of decisive games that White won increased, and White's overall winning percentage increased.<ref>Adorj<U+00E1>n 2004, pp. 67<U+2013>68.</ref> For example, taking the highest and lowest of Adorj<U+00E1>n's rating categories of 1669&nbsp;games played by the highest-rated players (Elo ratings 2700 and above), White scored 55.7% overall (W26.5 D58.4 L15.2), whereas of 34,924&nbsp;games played by the lowest-rated players (Elo ratings below 2100), White scored 53.1% overall (W37.0 D32.1 L30.8).<ref>Adorj<U+00E1>n 2004, p. 68.

The view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails. Even if it cannot be proved, this assumption is considered "safe" by Rowson and "logical" by Adorj<U+00E1>n.<ref>"We do not know for a fact that the starting position is drawn, but it does seem like a safe assumption from a hypertheoretical point of view."

At the level of "hypertheory", the concept of an "advantage" for either side is meaningless, since there are only three possible assessments of a position: win for White, win for Black, or draw.

|After 1.e4, "White ought to win", according to Adams.}}

Although it is very much a minority view, three prominent twentieth-century [[Chess master|master]]s claimed that White's advantage should or may be decisive with best play. [[Weaver Adams]], then one of the leading American masters,<ref>GM [[Arnold Denker]] and [[Larry Parr (editor)|Larry Parr]] listed Adams as one of 17 leading American masters during the years of the [[Great Depression]]. {{cite book | author=[[Arnold Denker|Denker, A.]] and [[Larry Parr (editor)|Parr, L.]] | title=The Bobby Fischer I Knew and Other Stories | publisher=Hypermodern Press | year=1995 | id=ISBN 1-886040-18-4 | page=200 }} Adams won the 1948 [[U.S. Open Chess Championship|U.S. Open chess championship]].

Adams' claim was widely ridiculed.<ref name="Berliner_p39">Berliner 1999, p. 39.</ref> GM [[Larry Evans]] wrote in 1962 that "Mr. Adams and his cronies may be linked to the radical [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] of chess. ...

Adams did not succeed in demonstrating the validity of his theory in tournament and match practice.

|After 1.d4, [[Hans Berliner|Berliner]] claimed that White may have a winning advantage.}}
More recently, IM [[Hans Berliner]], a former World Champion of [[Correspondence Chess]], claimed in his 1999 book ''The System'' that 1.d4 gives White a large, and possibly decisive, advantage. Berliner asserted that with best play White wins against the [[Gr<U+00FC>nfeld Defense]], the [[Modern Benoni]], the [[Benko Gambit]] and other (unnamed) "major defences", and achieves at least a large advantage in many lines of the [[Queen's Gambit Declined]].<ref>Berliner 1999, p. 8.</ref> However, he allowed that, "It is possible that the rules of chess are such that only some number of plausible-appearing defences to 1.d4 can be refuted."<ref>Berliner 1999, p. 11.</ref> Berliner wrote that Adams' "theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was the first person I met who actually had theories about how chess should be played."<ref name="Berliner_p39"/>

Berliner's thesis, like Adams', has been sharply criticized.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jeremysilman.com/book_reviews_js/js_system_world_champ_appr.html | title=Review by Jeremy Silman | publisher=JeremySilman.com | accessdate=2008-06-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jeremysilman.com/book_reviews_rb/rb_systm_wrld_chmpns_apprch.html | title=Review by Randy Bauer | publisher=JeremySilman.com | accessdate=2008-06-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/thesystem.pdf | title=Selling the Stairway to Heaven or, Weaver Was a Bargain | author=Kingston, T | format=PDF| publisher=[[ChessCafe.com]] | accessdate=2008-06-28 }}</ref> IM [[Jeremy Silman]] wrote, "the sheer insanity of [Berliner's] claims made me laugh out loud on several occasions ... .

==Modern perspectives==
As explained below, chess theorists in recent decades have continued to debate the size and nature of White's advantage, if any. Apart from Berliner, they have rejected the idea that White has a forced win from the opening position. Many also reject the traditional [[paradigm]] that Black's objective should be to neutralize White's initiative and obtain equality.

===White has an enduring advantage===
In 2004, GM [[Larry Kaufman]] expressed a more nuanced view than Adams and Berliner, arguing that the initiative stemming from the first move can always be transformed into some sort of enduring advantage, albeit not necessarily a decisive one. Kaufman writes, "I don't believe that White has a forced win in Chess. I do however believe that with either 1.e4 or 1.d4, White should be able to obtain some sort of advantage that persists into the [[Chess endgame|endgame]]. If chess were scored like [[boxing]], with drawn games awarded by some point system to the player (if any) who came 'closer' to winning, then I believe White would indeed have a forced win in theory."<ref>Kaufman 2004, p. 1.</ref>

===''Black is OK!''===
Starting in 1988, Adorj<U+00E1>n has argued in a series of books and magazine articles that "Black is OK!"<ref>Adorj<U+00E1>n 1988; Adorj<U+00E1>n 1998; Adorj<U+00E1>n 2004; Adorj<U+00E1>n 2005.</ref><ref>As of 2005, Adorj<U+00E1>n had published theoretical articles on the "Black is OK!" theme in 59 chess periodicals around the world. Adorj<U+00E1>n 2005, p. 8.</ref> Alone amongst modern writers, Adorj<U+00E1>n claims that White starts the game with essentially no advantage. He writes, "In my opinion, the only obvious advantage for White is that if he or she plays for a draw, and does so well, then Black can hardly avoid this without taking obvious risks."<ref>Adorj<U+00E1>n 1988, p. 1.</ref> Adorj<U+00E1>n goes so far as to claim that, "The tale of White's advantage is a delusion, belief in it is based on mass psychosis."<ref>Adorj<U+00E1>n 2004, p. 5 (emphasis deleted).</ref> Rowson writes that Adorj<U+00E1>n's "contention is one of the most important chess ideas of the last two decades ... because it has shaken our assumption that White begins the game with some advantage, and revealed its ideological nature".<ref>Rowson 2005, pp. 226<U+2013>27.</ref> However, Rowson rejects Adorj<U+00E1>n's claim that White has essentially no advantage, reasoning that "&nbsp;'White is better' and 'Black is OK' need not be mutually exclusive claims".<ref name="Rowson_p227">Rowson 2005, p. 227.</ref>

In one of Adorj<U+00E1>n's books, GM [[Lajos Portisch]] opines that "at least two-thirds of all 'tested' openings give White an apparent advantage." According to Portisch, for Black, "The root of the problem is that very few people know which are the openings where Black is really OK. Those who find these lines have nothing to fear, as ''Black is indeed OK'', but only in those variations!"<ref>Adorj<U+00E1>n 2005, p. 109 (statement by Portisch dated May 27, 1994 (boldface type changed to italics).</ref> Rowson considers this an important point,<ref name="Rowson_p227"/> noting that "1.d4&nbsp;players struggle to get anywhere against main-line [[Slav Defense|Slavs]] and 1.e4&nbsp;players find the [[Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation|Najdorf]] and [[Sicilian Defense#Sveshnikov Variation: 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e5|Sveshnikov Sicilians]] particularly tough."<ref>Rowson 2005, p. 228.</ref>

===Dynamism===
Modern writers often think of Black's role in more [[List of chess terms#Dynamism|dynamic]] terms than merely trying to equalize. Rowson writes that "the idea of Black trying to 'equalize' is questionable. I think it has limited application to a few openings, rather than being an opening prescription for Black in general."<ref name="Rowson_p227"/> Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer, "Fischer confided his 'secret' to me: unlike other masters, he sought to win with the Black pieces from the start. The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career, he said."<ref>Evans 1970, p. 91. However, GM [[Edmar Mednis]] offered a seemingly contradictory anecdote about Fischer: "Some years ago, in going over my games, he looked up in surprise whenever he noticed that I was jumping the gun in playing for attack with the Black pieces. Disapprovingly, he advised, 'You've got to equalize first with Black before looking for something.'" {{cite book | author=[[Edmar Mednis|Mednis, E.]] | title=How to Beat Bobby Fischer | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1997 | page=xxviii | id=ISBN 0-486-29844-2 }}</ref> Likewise, Watson surmised that Kasparov, when playing Black, bypasses the question of whether White has an opening advantage "by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible".<ref name="Watson 1998_p231">Watson 1998, p. 231.</ref> Watson observes that "energetic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. Sometimes we say 'dynamically balanced' instead of 'equal' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners."<ref>Watson 2006, p. 23.</ref>

Modern writers also question the idea that White has an enduring advantage. Suba, in his influential 1991 book ''Dynamic Chess Strategy'',<ref>Suba's book is described as "superlative" (Rowson 2005, p. 218) and "marvellous" (Watson 1998, p. 231). Both Rowson and Watson discuss Suba's theories at length.</ref> rejects the notion that the initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage. He contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation, and that, "Sometimes you must lose it, just like that. If you try to cling to it, by forcing the issue, your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won't be able to face a vigorous [[glossary of chess#Counterattack|counter-attack]]."<ref>Suba 1991, p. 64. Suba in this passage does not specifically tie "the initiative" to White. However, Rowson makes that connection explicit, stating in his discussion of this passage that "my personal view is that 'White's advantage' in practical play is 'the initiative.'" Rowson 2005, p. 219.</ref> Rowson and Watson concur.<ref>Rowson 2005, p. 219.</ref><ref>Watson 1998, p. 239.</ref> Watson also observes, "Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage."<ref>Watson 1998, p. 232.</ref>

===Countervailing advantages===
Rowson argues that both White and Black have certain advantages:<ref>Rowson 2005, pp. 217<U+2013>24 (White), 225<U+2013>45 (Black).</ref>

|Position after 12.Nf3: Black must either continue with the [[Igor Zaitsev|Zaitsev Variation]] (12...Re8), allowing White an immediate draw, or choose a different variation.}}

According to Rowson, White's first advantage is that, "The advantage of the first move has some similarities with the [[serve (tennis)|serve]] in [[tennis]] in that White can score an '[[ace (tennis)|ace]]' (for instance with a powerful [[List of chess terms#Novelty|opening novelty]]), he has more control over the pace and direction of the game, and he has a '[[Serve (tennis)#First and second serves|second serve]]' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players."<ref>Suba's view is similar to Rowson's: "The initiative is a subjective advantage. It creates promises of gaining an objective advantage when the opponent goes wrong, which is an event likely to happen when one's position is under pressure. Initiative is also a dynamic advantage when it helps you to gain time, provoking passive moves by active moves. Above all the initiative is a psychological advantage, exploiting human nature as well as the possibilities contained in the position." Suba 1991, p. 64.</ref> Third, some players are able to use the initiative to "play a kind of powerful '[[serve and volley]]' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep [[List of chess terms#Opening preparation|preparation]] and [[List of chess terms#Attack|attacking]] prowess." Fourth, "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This advantage is particularly acute in cases where there is a possible [[threefold repetition]], because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing."<ref name="Rowson_page224">Rowson 2005, p. 224.</ref>

Rowson cites as an example of the last phenomenon the well-regarded [[Ruy Lopez#Zaitsev Variation|Zaitsev Variation]] of the [[Ruy Lopez]]. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves once with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. This puts Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) insist on the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play on with a different move, or (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.<ref name="Rowson_page224"/><ref>Watson 2006, p. 137.</ref>

====Black's advantages====
Rowson argues that Black also has several advantages. First, "White's alleged advantage is also a kind of obligation to play for a win, and Black can often use this to his advantage." Second, "White's 'extra move' can be a burden, and sometimes White finds himself in a mild form of ''[[zugzwang]]'' ('Zugzwang Lite')." Third, although White begins the game with the initiative, if "Black retains a flexible position with good reactive possibilities, this initiative can be absorbed and often passes over to Black." Fourth, "The fact that White moves before Black often gives Black useful information".<ref name="Rowson_page245">Rowson 2005, p. 245.</ref> Suba likewise argues that White's advantage is actually less than a move, since White must tip his hand first, allowing Black to react to White's plans. Suba writes, "In terms of the mathematical [[game theory|games theory]], chess is a game of [[complete information]], and Black's information is always greater<U+2014>by one move!"<ref name="Suba_p134">Suba 1991, p. 134.</ref>

Rowson also notes that Black's chances increase markedly by playing good openings, which tend to be those with flexibility and latent potential, "rather than those that give White fixed targets or that try to take the initiative prematurely." He also emphasizes that "White has 'the initiative', not 'the advantage'. Success with Black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of 'potential'."<ref name="Rowson_page245"/> These ideas are exemplified by the [[Hedgehog (chess)|Hedgehog]], a dynamic modern system against the [[English Opening]] that can arise from various [[List of chess terms#Move order|move orders]]. A typical position arises after 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 b6 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.0-0 e6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6 9.e4 a6.<ref name="Watson_1988_p142">{{cite book | author=[[John L.

An examination of reversed and symmetrical openings illustrates White's and Black's respective advantages:
{{clear}}

=====Reversed openings=====
In a "reversed opening", White plays an opening typically played by Black, but with colors reversed and thus an extra [[tempo (chess)|tempo]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Brace, E. | title=An Illustrated Dictionary of Chess | publisher=David McKay | year=1977 | page=143 | id=ISBN 0-89058-020-0 }}</ref><ref>Hooper and Whyld 1992, p. 339.</ref> Evans writes of such openings, "If a defense is considered good for Black, it must be even better for White with a move in hand."<ref>{{cite book | author=Evans, L. | title=The Chess Opening for You | publisher=R.H.M. Press | year=1975 | page=38 | id=ISBN 0-89058-020-0 }} Lasker acknowledges this idea, without actually adopting it, writing, "Since the Sicilian yields a fair game to the second player, one is tempted to think that it should be proportionately stronger when essayed by the first player, who has all the advantages of that Opening and a move into the bargain." Lasker 1960, p. 99.</ref> Former World Champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] reportedly expressed the same view.<ref>IMs Alexander Raetsky and Maxim Chetverik relate "an old anecdote" that, "In the [[Moscow]] Chess Club someone answered 1.c4 with 1...e5 and was immediately reprimanded by former World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik. Botvinnik carefully explained that White now had a Sicilian with a tempo more..." {{cite book | author=Raetsky, A. & Chetverik, M. | title=English ...e5 | publisher=Everyman Chess | year=2003 | page=5 | id=ISBN 1-85744-339-X }}</ref><ref>GM [[Bent Larsen]] recalled playing a [[List of chess terms#Blitz chess|blitz game]] where Bovinnik [[List of chess terms#Kibitz|kibitzed]] after 1.c4 e5 that Black should take his move back because the "Sicilian is so strong that you cannot let your opponent play it with an extra tempo." Andrew Soltis, "Chess to Enjoy" column, "KIBITZER: ''one who gives good advice to your opponent''", ''[[Chess Life]]'', May 1995, p. 18.</ref> Watson questions this idea, citing Suba's thesis that Black, by moving second, has more complete information than White.<ref name="Watson 1998_p231"/> He writes, "everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5), but ... leading masters have no qualms about answering 1.c4 with 1...e5."<ref name="Watson 1998_page233">Watson 1998, p. 233.</ref> To explain this [[paradox]], Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines, showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of various "extra" moves for White.<ref>Watson 1998, pp. 234<U+2013>36.</ref> He concludes, "The point is, Black's set-up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system, but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as White. This is true because Black is able to react to the specific plan White chooses; in Suba's terms, his information is indeed a move greater! Furthermore, he is able to take advantage of dead equal positions which White (hoping to retain the advantage of the first move) would normally avoid."<ref>Watson 1998, p. 236. In an earlier book, Watson wrote of the position after 1.c4 e5, "More often than not, the extra tempo brings with it the drawback of committing oneself before one's opponent, and thus opening oneself to possible counterattacks and equalizing plans."

Watson also observes, "Similarly, the [[Dutch Defence]] looks particularly sterile when White achieves the reversed positions a tempo up (it turns out that he has nothing useful to do!); and indeed, many standard Black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand."<ref name="Watson 1998_page233"/> GM [[Alex Yermolinsky]] likewise notes that GM [[Vladimir Malaniuk]], a successful exponent of the [[Dutch Defense|Leningrad Dutch]] (1.d4 f5 2.g3 g6) at the highest levels,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1070347 | title=Kasparov-Malaniuk, Moscow 1988 | publisher=ChessGames.com | accessdate=2008-06-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1334325 | title=Karpov-Malaniuk, Keres Memorial rapid 2005 | publisher=ChessGames.com | accessdate=2008-06-28 }}</ref> "once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone's suggestion that he should try 1.f4 as White.

Watson concludes that (a) "most moves have disadvantages as well as advantages, so an extra move is not always an unqualified blessing"; (b) "with his extra information about what White is doing, Black can better react to the new situation"; and (c) because a draw is likely to be more acceptable to Black than to White, White is apt to avoid lines that allow drawish simplifications, while Black may not object to such lines.<ref name="Watson 1998_page233"/>

=====Symmetrical openings=====
Rowson writes that "in general one would assume that whatever advantage White has would be revealed most clearly in [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] positions."<ref>Rowson 2005, p. 230.</ref> Accordingly, Watson, Suba, Evans, and the eminent player and theorist [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] (1886<U+2013>1935) have all argued that it is in Black's interest to avoid symmetry.<ref>Watson 1998, pp. 236<U+2013>37.</ref><ref>Suba contends that Black should strive for "[e]lastic and non-symmetrical pawn structures." Suba 1991, p. 24.</ref><ref>"To win with the Black pieces you must assume risks and avoid symmetrical positions." Evans 1970, p. 21.</ref><ref>Nimzowitsch asserted that if in the symmetrical [[French Defence#Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 exd5|Exchange Variation]] of the [[French Defence|French Defense]] White develops his [[List of chess terms#Kingside|king's]] [[knight (chess)|knight]] to f3, that "must be answered" by ...Ne7, while ...Nf6 "is the necessary answer" if White develops the knight to e2.

Further, a particular extra move is sometimes more of a liability than an asset. For example, Soltis notes that the [[French Defence#Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 exd5|Exchange French]] position arising after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 exd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 "is pretty equal." The same position, but with Black's knight moved to e4, arises in Petroff's Defense after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5.

Finally, symmetrical positions may be difficult for the White player for psychological reasons. Watson writes that anyone who tries the Exchange French, "even if he thinks he is playing for a win, assume[s] a psychological burden.

Rowson gives the following example of Black outplaying White from the [[English Opening#Common responses|Symmetrical Variation]] of the [[English Opening]]. He remarks, "there is something compelling about Black's [[Chess strategy|strategy]]. He seems to be saying: 'I will copy all your good moves, and as soon as you make a bad move, I won't copy you any more!'"<ref name="R230">Rowson 2005, pp. 230<U+2013>34.</ref>

[[Julian Hodgson|Hodgson]] <U+2013> [[Keith Arkell|Arkell]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] 2001: '''1.c4 c5 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.Nc3 Nc6 5.a3 a6 6.Rb1 Rb8 7.b4 cxb4 8.axb4 b5 9.cxb5 axb5''' Here Rowson remarks, "Both sides want to push their d-pawn and play Bf4/...Bf5, but White has to go first so Black gets to play ...d5 before White can play d4. This doesn't matter much, but it already points to the challenge that White faces here; his most natural continuations allow Black to play the moves he wants to. I would therefore say that White is in 'Zugzwang Lite' and that he remains in this state for several moves." '''10.Nf3 d5''' 10...Nf6 11.0-0 0-0 12.d3 d6 13.Bd2 Bd7 would transpose to the Portisch-Tal game below. '''11.d4 Nf6 12.Bf4 Rb6 13.0-0 Bf5 14.Rb3 O-O 15.Ne5 Ne4 16.h3 h5!?''' Finally breaking the symmetry. '''17.Kh2''' The position is still almost symmetrical, and White can find nothing useful to do with his extra move. Rowson whimsically suggests 17.h4!?, forcing Black to be the one to break the symmetry. '''17...Re8!''' Rowson notes that this is a useful waiting move, covering e7, which needs protection in some lines, and possibly supporting an eventual ...e5 (see Black's twenty-second move). White cannot copy it, since after 18.Re1? Nxf2 Black would win a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]. '''18.Be3?! Nxe5! 19.dxe5 Rc6!''' Rowson notes that with his more active pieces, "It looks like Black has some initiative." If now 20.Nxd5, Bxe5 "is at least equal for Black". '''20.Nxb5 Bxe5!''' 20...Nxf2? 21.Qxd5! wins. '''21.Nd4 Bxd4 22.Bxd4 e5''' Rowson writes, "Now both sides have their trumps, but I think Black has some advantage, due to his extra central control, imposing [[knight (chess)|knight]] and prospects for a [[List of chess terms#Kingside|king-side]] [[List of chess terms#Attack|attack]]." '''23.b5 Rc8 24.Bb2 d4''' Now White has a difficult game: Rowson analyzes 25.e3?! Nxg3 24.fxg3 Bc2 25.Qf3 Bxb3 26.exd4 Bc4!, winning; 25.g4 hxg4 26.hxg4 Nxf2! 27.Rxf2 Bc2, winning; 25.Qe1!? Rc2! with advantage; and 25.f4 (risky-looking, but perhaps best) Nc3! 26.Bxc3 dxc3 27.Qxd8 Rexd8, and Black is better. '''25.b6?''' Overlooking Black's threat. '''25...Nxf2! 26.Qe1''' If 26.Rxf2, Bc2 [[Fork (chess)|forks]] White's [[Queen (chess)|queen]] and [[Rook (chess)|rook]].

==Tournament and match play==
In [[chess tournament]]s and matches, the frequency with which each player receives White and Black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter.<ref>Ka<U+017E>i<U+0107> 1980, p. 11.</ref> In [[round robin tournament]]s with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of Whites and Blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra White or Black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the [[tournament director]] may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more Blacks than Whites, or vice versa.<ref>Goichberg, Jarecki, and Riddle 1993, pp. 126-27, 236-37.</ref> The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of Whites and Blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.<ref>Ka<U+017E>i<U+0107> 1980, p. 56.</ref>

In [[Swiss system tournament]]s, the tournament director tries to ensure that each player receives, as nearly as possible, the same number of games as White and Black, and that the player's color alternates from round to round.<ref>Goichberg, Jarecki, and Riddle 1993, p. 80, 105.</ref> After the first round, the director may deviate from the otherwise prescribed pairings in order to give as many players as possible their equalizing or due colors.<ref>Goichberg, Jarecki, and Riddle 1993, pp. 103, 106.</ref> More substantial deviations are permissible to avoid giving a player two more Blacks than Whites (for example, three Blacks in four games) than vice versa, since extra Whites "cause far less player distress" than extra Blacks, which impose "a significant handicap" on the affected player.<ref>Goichberg, Jarecki, and Riddle 1993, p. 108.</ref> Tournaments with an even number of rounds cause the most problems, since if there is a disparity, it is greater (e.g., a player receiving two Whites and four Blacks).<ref>Goichberg, Jarecki, and Riddle 1993, p. 125.</ref>

==Solving chess==
{{Split section|Solving chess|Talk:Computer chess#Solving chess - new article suggestion|date=March 2010}}
[[Endgame tablebase]]s have solved chess to a limited degree, determining perfect play in a number of [[Chess endgame|endgame]]s, including all non-trivial endgames with no more than six pieces or pawns (including the two kings).<ref name="Hurd_Haworth">{{cite web

}}</ref> It is probable that seven-piece endgames will be solved by the end of 2015.<ref name="Hurd_Haworth"/>

[[Jonathan Rowson]] has speculated that "in principle it should be possible for a machine to ... develop 32-piece tablebases. This may take decades or even centuries, but unless runaway [[global warming]] or [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] gets in the way, I think it will eventually happen."<ref>Rowson 2005, pp. 205<U+2013>06.</ref> However, [[Information theory|information theorist]] [[Claude Shannon]] has argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this. In his 1950 paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" he writes:<ref>{{cite web
 | author=[[Claude Shannon|Shannon, C.]]

}}</ref><blockquote>
With chess it is possible, in principle, to play a perfect game or construct a machine to do so as follows: One considers in a given position all possible moves, then all moves for the opponent, etc., to the end of the game (in each variation). The end must occur, by the rules of the games after a finite number of moves (remembering the [[fifty-move rule|50 move drawing rule]]). Each of these variations ends in win, loss or draw. By working backward from the end one can determine whether there is a forced win, the position is a draw or is lost. It is easy to show, however, even with the high computing speed available in electronic calculators this computation is impractical. In typical chess positions there will be of the order of 30 legal moves. The number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly finished as shown ... by De Groot, who averaged the number of legal moves in a large number of master games. Thus a move for White and then one for Black gives about 10<sup>3</sup> possibilities. A typical game lasts about 40 moves to resignation of one party. This is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to checkmate, not resignation. However, even at this figure there will be 10<sup>120</sup> variations to be calculated from the initial position. A machine operating at the rate of one variation per micro-second would require over 10<sup>90</sup> years to calculate the first move!</blockquote>

It is thus theoretically possible to "[[Solved game|solve]]" chess, determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for White, a draw, or even a win for Black. However, according to Shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology.

[[Hans-Joachim Bremermann]], a professor of [[mathematics]] and [[biophysics]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], further argued in a 1965 paper that the "speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers: the ''[[light barrier]]'', the ''quantum barrier'', and the ''thermodynamical barrier''. These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess." Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, "In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [of chess] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting."<ref>{{cite web

[[Jonathan Schaeffer]], the scientist who led the effort, said a breakthrough such as [[quantum computing]] would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted, but he does not rule out the possibility, saying that the one thing he learned from his 16-year effort of solving checkers "is to never underestimate the advances in technology".<ref>{{cite web
