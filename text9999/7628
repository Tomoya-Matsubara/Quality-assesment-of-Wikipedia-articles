'''Portland International Jetport''' {{airport codes|PWM|KPWM|PWM}} is a public [[airport]] located two miles (3 km) west of the [[central business district]] of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], in [[Cumberland County, Maine|Cumberland County]], [[Maine]], United States. It is owned by the City of Portland.<ref name=FAA /> A significant portion of the Jetport, including the main runway, is located in the neighboring city of [[South Portland, Maine|South Portland]].<ref>http://www.theforecaster.net/node/18212/</ref>

This regional airport serves much of [[Maine]] and is the busiest airport in the state. In 2007, the airport handled a record 1,648,568 passengers, up 17.0% from the previous year.<ref>[http://www.portlandjetport.org/stats.asp Portland Jetport Statistics]</ref>  Recently, the Jetport has benefited from service by [[low-cost carrier]]s such as [[JetBlue]] and [[AirTran Airways]]. PWM is now in the process of expanding and updating its [[airport terminal|terminal]] to allow more [[airline]] service.

==History==
The airfield was founded in the late 1920s by Dr. Clifford <U+201C>Kip<U+201D> Strange, who needed space for his [[Curtiss Jenny|JN-4 "Jenny" Biplane]]. Known as '''Stroudwater Field,''' the airport received its first commercial service on December 17, 1934. Two years later, the city of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] bought the airfield and changed its name to '''Portland-Westbrook-Municipal.''' "Westbrook" referred to the location of the last directional light before the airport in the nearby town of [[Westbrook, Maine|Westbrook]].

The current airport started to take shape in the 1950s to 60s.  Runway 11/29 was built in 1957 and lengthened to {{convert|6800|ft|m|0}} in 1966. The current terminal was opened in 1968, when [[jet aircraft|jet]] service began.<ref>[http://www.portlandjetport.org/history.asp History of the Portland Jetport]</ref> 

In 2004, the [[Portland, Maine|City of Portland]] again lengthened the runway, to {{convert|7200|ft|m|0}}, to accommodate larger aircraft. 

The terminal has been expanded at least twice, and there are plans for a further expansion of the concourse in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Executive Summary Report |publisher=The Coffman Associates |year=2007 |url=http://www.coffmanassociates.com/media/Portland/ExSumRpt.pdf |accessdate=2007-06-11|format=PDF}}</ref>

Other changes include improvements to the terminal and [[baggage claim]], reconfiguration of the airport access road and terminal roads, and rehabilitation and expansion of the parking garage. The [[Portland, Maine|City of Portland]] is also planning to expand the [[General Aviation|general aviation]] ramp, enlarge the [[Air cargo|cargo]] ramp and facilities, reconfigure the alignment of [[taxiway]]s, and eventually reconfigure [[runway]] 18/36.

The airport was the starting point of [[Mohammed Atta]] and [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]]'s travels on [[September 11, 2001]]. The pair flew to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], where they boarded [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and later hijacked it and crashed it into [[One World Trade Center tenants|One]] [[World Trade Center]]. [[Mohamed Atta's Nissan|Their rental car]] was later taken from the Jetport.

In the wake of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]], many U.S. airlines began offering fewer flights. This furthered the airlines' shift from [[jet airliner|mainline jet]] aircraft to smaller [[regional jets]] or [[turboprops]] at PWM.  In late 2002, [[American Eagle Airlines|American Eagle]] stopped flying to the Jetport.<ref>[http://www1.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/1715638/?searchid=1715638&s=American+Eagle+PWM#ID1715638 Airliners.net Civil Aviation Forums: American Eagle To End Portland, Maine]</ref>  On September 1, 2005, [[Delta Air Lines]] ended mainline service to PWM. Despite the airline's strong history at Portland, serving the Jetport in the past with aircraft as large as the [[Boeing 757]] and [[Boeing 727]], all flights from that date on were set to be operated by [[Delta Connection]] on [[Bombardier Aerospace#Canadair Regional Jets|Canadair Regional Jet]]s.

[[File:Fedex-727-pwm.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A FedEx 727 at PWM, 2009.]]
Some service began to return as the airline industry returned to health in 2005 and 2006.  The first step up came with the introduction of the [[low cost carrier]] [[Independence Air]] in 2005.  On May 1 of 2005, Independence added a daily flight to [[Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]] on an [[Airbus]] [[Airbus A319|A319]], making them the first carrier to fly an Airbus out of Portland. Portland was one of few markets that Independence Air consistently served with its larger A319 jets, and at the time of their [[bankruptcy]] Portland was rumored to be one of their few profitable destinations.   [[FedEx Express]] also began using an Airbus [[Airbus A310|A310]] [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] jet on its [[cargo airline|cargo]] flights to [[Memphis International Airport|Memphis]] later that year, although today the company still primarily uses a 727 for those flights.  On July 1, 2005, Portland received its first [[transatlantic]] arrival. The flight was [[Primaris Airlines]] flight 3 from [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]], Ireland. The flight was on a Boeing 757-200 with the registration {{airreg|N|740PA}}. 

[[File:Jetblue n763jb pwm 07302009.jpg|thumb|right|300px|jetBlue A320 "Unforgettably Blue" at PWM, 2009.]]
After Independence Air went bankrupt, Portland was left without a low-cost carrier, causing fares to go up, and passenger numbers to once again decline.<ref>{{cite web|title=Airport Statistics |publisher=City of Portland |url=http://www.portlandjetport.org/stats.asp |accessdate=2007-06-11}}</ref> Capitalizing on the under served market, [[JetBlue Airways]] began service to Portland on May 23, 2006, with four daily flights to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York/JFK]] aboard [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] jets.  This made them the second largest air carrier at the Jetport (in terms of available seats) nearly overnight.  This addition of service has inspired what is known as the [[Southwest Airlines#The Southwest Effect|Southwest Effect]], where the addition of a large number of low cost seats in a market forces down the price of competing tickets.<ref name="autogenerated3">[http://www1.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/2622480/6/ Discussion of this topic on Airliners.net]</ref>

On June 7, 2007, [[AirTran Airways]] began seasonal service to [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport|Baltimore/Washington Airport]], as well as to [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Florida]]. This established AirTran as the second low cost carrier in Portland, competing with JetBlue.  This is the first time that Portland has received direct service to a Florida destination, a market that has been the focus of much speculation in past years. Flights are  operated on [[Boeing 717]] and [[Boeing 737]] jets, some of the largest aircraft scheduled to the Jetport currently.  At the same time of AirTran's arrival, JetBlue announced that it would be adding a fifth flight of their own to New York, further increasing the number of available low cost seats.  Later, on September 26, 2007 JetBlue also announced a daily direct flight to Orlando, using its [[Embraer 190]] equipment, beginning in January of that year.  The year 2007 was a record high for Portland, the added service posted a 17% increase in passengers from the year before.

In 2008, Delta Air Lines returned mainline service to Portland, with a daily flight to Atlanta on a [[McDonnell Douglas]] [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-88]] jet.  At the same time, a regional start up, [[New England Air Transport]] (NEAT) began intra-state air service, flying three times weekly to [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]] with a [[Piper Aircraft|Piper]] [[Piper PA-31|Navajo Chieftain]].  This was the first intra-state service offered out of Portland in more than a decade.  With these increases, 2008 also saw a number of losses of service, with air traffic in an overall decline as the airline industry scaled back with economic decline.  At the onset of 2009, the Jetport saw the return of international service. [[Starlink Aviation]] announced the start of service between Portland and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]], to begin on [[4 February]] of that year.
