'''Elias Ashmole''' ([[23 May]] [[1617]]&ndash;[[18 May]] [[1692]]), the celebrated English [[antiquarian|antiquary]], was a [[politician]], [[officer of arms]], student of [[astrology]] and [[alchemy]], and an early speculative [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. He supported the [[Cavaliers (royalists)|royalist]] side during the [[English Civil War]], and at the [[English Restoration|restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] he was rewarded with several lucrative offices. Throughout his life he was an avid collector of curiosities and other artifacts. Many of these he acquired from the traveller, botanist, and collector [[John Tradescant the younger]], and most he donated to [[Oxford University]] to create the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. He also donated his library and priceless [[manuscript]] collection to Oxford.

Apart from his collecting hobbies, Ashmole illustrates the passing of the occult philosophy in the 17th century: while he immersed himself in alchemical, magical and astrological studies and was consulted on astrological questions by Charles II and his court, these studies were essentially backward-looking. Although he was one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society]], a key institution in the development of experimental science, he never participated actively.

== Solicitor and royalist ==
Ashmole was born in [[Lichfield]], [[Staffordshire]]. His family had been famous, but its wealth had declined somewhat by the time of Ashmole's birth. The family name is likely a variation in spelling of Ashmore (from "ash moor," also a [[Ashmore|place name]]), as the two spellings were used interchangeably in the [[Midlands]].[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~blanchec/ThosASHMOLEFamily.htm]  His father, [[Simon Ashmole]], was a soldier and a saddler; his mother Anne was a cousin of [[James Pagit]], a [[Exchequer of pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]]. Ashmole attended [[Lichfield Grammar School]] and became a [[chorister]] at [[Lichfield Cathedral]]. In 1638, with the help of Pagit, he became a [[solicitor]]. He enjoyed a successful practice in [[London]], and married [[Eleanor Mainwaring]], a member of a poor but [[aristocratic]] family, who died only three years later. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken the first steps towards status and wealth.
Ashmole supported the side of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, [[Peter Mainwaring]], at [[Smallwood]] in [[Cheshire]]. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed [[Excise|King's Commissioner of Excise]] at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, he was given a military post at [[Oxford]], where he devoted most of his time to study and acquired a deep interest in alchemy, astrology and magic. He studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], though he did not formally enroll as a student. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at [[Worcester]]. (Excise Commissioners set [[taxes]] on specific locally-produced [[commodities]]; at that time, the division between official and personal property was not as rigorously observed as it is today, so such offices could be very lucrative to their holders.) Ashmole was given the additional military posts of [[Captain of the Horse]] and [[Comptroller of Ordnance]], though he seems never to have participated in any fighting. 

== Freemason ==

After the Royalist defeat of 1646, he retired again to Cheshire. During this period, he was admitted as a [[Freemason]] (the earliest documented admission of a Freemason in an English lodge). His diary entry for 16 October 1646 reads in part:  "I was made a Free Mason at Warrington, in Lancashire, with Coll: Henry Mainwaring, of Karincham, in Cheshire." Although there is only one other mention of Masonic activity in his diary he seems to have remained in good standing and well-connected with the fraternity as he was still attending meetings in 1682. On 10 March that year he wrote:  "About 5 H P.M., I received a summons to appear at a Lodge to held the next day, at Mason's Hall, London." The following day, 11 March 1682, he wrote:  "Accordingly, I went & about Noone were admitted into the Fellowship of free Masons." And, "I was the Senior Fellow among them (it being 35 years since I was admitted)." And "We all dyned at the halfe Moone Taverne in Cheapside, at a noble dinner prepaired at the charge of the new-accepted Masons."

== Marriage ==

In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of [[Aldermaston]]), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior. She was a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and the mother of grown children. The marriage took place over the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed an unsuccessful suit for separation and [[alimony]] in 1657. The match, did, however, provide Ashmole with her first husband's estates centred on [[Bradfield, Berkshire|Bradfield]] in [[Berkshire]] which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests without concern for his livelihood.

== Alchemy and the Tradescant Collection ==
[[Image:Fasciculus chemicus frontispiece.png|thumb|175px|left|Frontispiece to Ashmole's translation of ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]''.]]

During the 1650s, Ashmole devoted a great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650 he published ''[[Fasciculus Chemicus]]'' under the [[anagram]]matic [[pseudonym]] '''James Hasholle'''. This work was an English translation of two [[Latin language|Latin]] alchemical works, one by [[Arthur Dee]]. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, ''[[Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum]]'', an extensively annotated compilation of alchemical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately-held manuscripts. It was avidly studied by other alchemists.

In 1653, the alchemist and near-neighbour, [[William Backhouse]] of [[Swallowfield]], who had made Ashmole his alchemical "son", is said to have confided the secret of the [[Philosopher's Stone]] to Ashmole when the former believed himself to be close to death. (The Philosopher's Stone was a substance or object that had the power to convert [[base metals]] to [[gold]], among other mystical virtues: its discovery was one of the key goals of European alchemists.) Ashmole is said to have passed the secret on to [[Robert Plot]], the first keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. Ashmole published his final alchemical work, ''[[The Way to Bliss]]'', in 1658. There is no evidence of him personally carrying out any actual experiments (or "operations", in the alchemical jargon of the time).

Ashmole met the [[botanist]] and collector [[John Tradescant the younger]] around 1650. Tradescant had, with [[John Tradescant the elder|his father]], built up a vast and renowned collection of exotic [[plants]], [[mineral]] specimens and other curiosities from around the world. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the ''[[Musaeum Tradescantianum]]''. In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son and heir ten years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow Hester contested the deed, but the matter was settled in [[Chancery]] in Ashmole's favor two years later. Some scholars consider that Ashmole was an <U+201C>ambitious, ingratiating<U+201D> social climber who stole a hero's legacy.[http://economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=7109138]

== Restoration ==
At the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660, Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded. He was given the office of Comptroller for the Excise in London, and later was made a Commissioner of [[Surinam]] and the [[Accountant General of the Excise]], a position that made him responsible for a large portion of the king's revenue. These posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable [[patronage]] power.

Ashmole became one of the founding members of the [[Royal Society]] in 1661, but he was never an active member. His most significant appointment, though, was to the [[College of Arms]] as [[Windsor Herald|Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary]] in 1660. In this position he devoted himself to the study of the history of the [[Order of the Garter]], which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s. In 1667, he began collecting information for his ''Antiquities of Berkshire'' and, [[1672|five years later]], published the fruits of years of research concerning ''The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter'', a lavish [[Book size|folio]] with illustrations by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]]. Ashmole performed the [[heraldry|heraldic]] and [[genealogy|genealogical]] work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered the leading authority on [[court protocol]] and [[ceremony]].

In 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and Ashmole married the much younger daughter of his friend and fellow [[herald]], the antiquarian Sir [[William Dugdale]]. In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms. He was offered the post of [[Garter Principal King of Arms]], but he turned it down in favor of Dugdale.

As might be expected of a herald, Ashmole possessed a coat of arms. In his case, he was entitled to one by descent from [[armigerous]] ancestors. This [[coat of arms]] is expressed in heraldic terminology ([[blazon]]ed) as ''Quarterly sable and or with a fleur de lis or in the first quarter'' with ''a greyhound courant'' for the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]]. In 1661, Ashmole was granted a new crest in place of the greyhound, one which reflected his interest in astrology: ''On a wreath sable and or the planet Mercury collocated in the middle of the caelestiall Signe Gemini proper his right hand extended toward heaven and left holding a Caducan rod or''.

Though his interest in alchemy cooled somewhat after the 1650s, he never lost interest in magic and [[astrology]]. He was often consulted on astrological matters by Charles II and members of his court. In 1672, he acquired some of [[John Dee]]'s previously unknown spiritual diaries describing his conferences with angels. He devoted much time and energy to the intensive study of these manuscripts, and contemplated writing a biography of Dee.

== Ashmolean Museum ==
{{main|Ashmolean Museum}}

[[Image:AshmoleRiley.jpg|frame|Portrait of Elias Ashmole c. 1681 by [[John Riley (artist)|John Riley]]. Now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]].]] 

In 1677, Ashmole made a gift of the Tradescant Collection, together with material he had collected independently, to [[Oxford University]] on the condition that a suitable home be built to house the materials and make them available to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, designed by [[Christopher Wren]], was completed in 1682. According to [[Anthony Wood]], the collection filled twelve wagons when it was transferred to Oxford. It would have been more, but a large part of Ashmole's own collection, destined for the museum, including coins, medals, antiquities, books, manuscripts and prints, was destroyed in a disastrous fire in the [[Middle Temple]] on [[January 26]], [[1679]].

Ashmole's health began to deteriorate in the 1680s, and though he would hold his excise office until he died, he became much less active in affairs. He began to collect notes on his life in diary form to serve as source material for a biography; although the biography was never written, these notes are a rich source of information on Ashmole and his times. He died in [[Lambeth]] on [[May 18]], [[1692]]. He was buried at [[South Lambeth Church]]. Ashmole bequeathed his library and his priceless manuscript collection to Oxford.

[[Michael Hunter (author)|Michael Hunter]], in his entry on Ashmole for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', concluded that the most salient points of Ashmole's character were his ambition and his hierarchical vision of the world&mdash;a vision that unified his [[monarchist|royalism]] and his interests in heraldry, genealogy, ceremony, and even astrology and magic. He was as successful in his legal, business and political affairs as he was in his collecting and scholarly pursuits. His antiquarian work is still considered valuable, and his alchemical publications, especially the ''Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum'', preserved many works that might otherwise have been lost. He formed several close and long-lasting friendships, with [[John Aubrey]] for example, but, as [[Richard Garnett]] has observed, "acquisitiveness was his master passion".

''A note on sources:'' Both Garnett's 1891 entry in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]]'' and Michael Hunter's 2004 entry in the ''ODNB'' agree on the facts of Ashmole's life. Hunter's is, however, more detailed and makes use of a wider range of sources and benefits from more current scholarship. Beresiner's article has additional details on Ashmole's connection with early Freemasonry.
