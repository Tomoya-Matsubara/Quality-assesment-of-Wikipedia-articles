The '''Zhanghewan Pumped Storage Power Station''' is a [[pumped-storage]] [[hydroelectric]] power station located {{Convert|50|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Shijiazhuang]] in [[Jingxing County]] of [[Hebei Province]], China. Construction on the power station began in 6 December 2003 and the first unit was commissioned in 1 February 2009. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir is created by the Zhanghewan Dam  on the Gantao River which was built between 1977 and 1980, originally for irrigation. For this project the Zhanhewan Dam was raised {{Convert|23|m|ft|abbr=one}}. The Zhanghewan Upper Reservoir is on Laoyemiao Mountain, above the west side of the lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Zhanghewan Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a [[peaking power plant]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/projdocs/2002/hebei_zhanghewan.pdf | title=Summary Environmental Impact Assessment  Hebei Zhanghewan Pumped Storage Project  in The  People<U+2019>s Republic Of China | publisher=Asian Development Bank | date=April 2002 | accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>

The lower reservoir is created by the Zhanghewan Dam, a {{Convert|77.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall [[gravity dam]] on the Gantao River. It can withhold up to {{Convert|83300000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}}. The upper reservoir is created by a {{Convert|57|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{Convert|456|m|ft|abbr=on}} long circular [[rock-fill dam]] on Laoyemiao Mountain, to the west of the lower reservoir. It can withhold up to {{Convert|7700000|m3|acre.ft|abbr=on}} of water. Water from the upper reservoir is sent to the 1,200 MW [[underground power station]] down near the lower reservoir through four {{Convert|850|m|ft|abbr=on}} long headrace/[[penstock]] pipes. The drop in elevation between the upper and lower reservoir affords a [[hydraulic head]] (water drop) of {{Convert|305|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hydrochina.net/en/businesslistcaseshow.aspx?ProductsID=774&CaseId=310&CateId=310&pid=288 | title=Zhanghewan pumped storage power station | publisher=HydroChina | accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>
