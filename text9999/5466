'''No. 79 Wing''' was a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] of [[World War II]]. It was formed in December 1943 at [[Batchelor, Northern Territory]], as part of North Western Area Command. Led by Group Captain [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]], the wing comprised four [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]]s on its establishment, flying [[Bristol Beaufort|Beaufort]] and [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] bombers and [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] heavy fighters. No.&nbsp;79 Wing took part in the [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[North Western Area Campaign]]s during 1944, transferring to bases in [[New Guinea]] and later [[Morotai]] as the Allies advanced northward. By the end of the Pacific War, the wing was attached to the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] and was made up of [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;2]] and [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadrons]], both flying Mitchells. The latter transferred to the [[Netherlands Air Force]] in late 1945, while the former returned to Australia where it disbanded the following year.

==History==
[[File:Eaton1941.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Group Captain Eaton (pictured in 1941), inaugural commander of No.&nbsp;79 Wing]]
No.&nbsp;79 Wing was established at [[Batchelor, Northern Territory]], on 30&nbsp;November 1943. Its combat units consisted of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|Nos.&nbsp;1]] and [[No. 2 Squadron RAAF|2 Squadrons]] (flying [[Bristol Beaufort|Beaufort]] light reconnaissance bombers), [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;31 Squadron]] ([[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]] long-range fighters), and [[No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;18 (Netherlands East Indies) 
Squadron]] ([[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchell]] medium bombers). The wing was commanded by Group Captain [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]], whose Dutch personnel called him "Oom Charles" (Uncle Charles).<ref>Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', p. 38</ref><ref name="Odgers">[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/13.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 215&ndash;218]</ref> 

Operating under the auspices of North Western Area Command (NWA), [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], No.&nbsp;79 Wing participated in the [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]] and [[North Western Area Campaign]]s during 1944.<ref name="Odgers"/> Through March&ndash;April, the Beaufighters attacked Japanese shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed [[Timor]] on a daily basis as a prelude to [[Operations Reckless and Persecution]], the invasions of [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] and [[Aitape]]. Eaton organised a large raid against [[South Central Timor Regency|Su]], Dutch Timor, on 19&nbsp;April. Consisting of thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters, the force destroyed the town's barracks and fuel dumps, a result that earned the personal congratulations of the [[Air Officer Commanding]] NWA, Air Vice Marshal [[Adrian Cole (RAAF officer)|"King" Cole]].<ref name="Odgers"/><ref>Farram, ''Charles "Moth" Eaton'', pp. 48&ndash;49</ref> On the day of the Allied landings, 22&nbsp;April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on [[Dili]], Portuguese Timor. The ground assault on Hollandia&ndash;Aitape met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment leading up to it.<ref name="Odgers"/>

In May 1944, Nos.&nbsp;1, 18 and 31 Squadrons attacked Japanese positions in Timor, while No.&nbsp;2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells. No.&nbsp;79 Wing's light and medium bombers suffered from a lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which to refuel. No.&nbsp;2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No.&nbsp;18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/14.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 228&ndash;233]</ref> In June&ndash;July, No.&nbsp;79 Wing supported the [[Battle of Noemfoor|Allied attack on Noemfoor]]. No.&nbsp;18 Squadron was again the wing's most active unit, flying 107 sorties. In September, the Beaufighters and Mitchells attacked Japanese shipping and infrastructure in [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], but lost nine aircraft and twenty-six crewmen killed, among them Squadron Leader Wilbur Wackett, son of [[Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation]] manager [[Lawrence Wackett]].<ref name="Odgers pp.243-247">[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/15.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 243&ndash;247]</ref><ref>Johnston, ''Whispering Death'', pp. 16, 160, 396</ref> By the end of the month, Mitchell missions were put on hold while replacement crews were trained.<ref name="Odgers"/> In late 1944, the decision was made to transfer No.&nbsp;79 Wing and its Mitchell squadrons from North Western Area Command to Northern Command (formerly [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF|No.&nbsp;9 Operational Group]]) in [[Papua New Guinea]], to undertake operations against the Japanese in [[New Britain]]. No.&nbsp;31 Squadron was transferred from No.&nbsp;79 Wing to the [[Australian First Tactical Air Force]] at [[Morotai]] in December.<ref name="Odgers pp.297-299">[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 297&ndash;299]</ref><ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/23.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', p. 379]</ref> The same month, Group Captain Eaton posted out and was replaced by Group Captain [[John Ryland]].<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160191b.htm Ryland, John Peter] at [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]].

Weather hampered the wing's activities in January 1945. No.&nbsp;1 Squadron was withdrawn to [[Queensland]] to re-equip with [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquitos]], with [[No. 13 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;13 Squadron]], flying [[Lockheed Ventura|Venturas]], taking up the slack on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No.&nbsp;79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to [[Jacquinot Bay]] in New Britain. On 6&nbsp;April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos.&nbsp;2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] of [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;82 Wing]] in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser ''[[Japanese cruiser Isuzu|Isuzu]]''. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off [[Sumba]] so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/24.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 402&ndash;407]</ref> Allied submarines sank the damaged ''Isuzu'' the next day.<ref name="18Sqn">[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11051.asp 18 (NEI) Squadron RAAF] at [[Australian War Memorial]].
