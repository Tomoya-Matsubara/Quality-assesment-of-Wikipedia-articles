'''U.S. Route 1 Business''' ('''US 1 Bus.''') is a four-lane surface road that provides an alternate route to the [[Trenton Freeway]] ([[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US 1]]) northeast of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] in [[Mercer County, New Jersey]]. The route is {{convert|2.73|mi|km|2|abbr=on}} long and runs between US 1 in Trenton and [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]]. On the border of Trenton and Lawrence Township, US 1 Bus. intersects the northbound direction of [[U.S. Route 206|US 206]] at the Brunswick Circle. The route was once part of a longer '''U.S. Route 1 Alternate''' ('''US 1 Alt.'''), which continued southwest through downtown Trenton and into [[Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Morrisville, Pennsylvania]]. 

The old US 1 Alt. in Trenton is now signed by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] as part of US 1 Bus., despite not being officially recognized as such. Signage in Pennsylvania no longer exists; most of the former US 1 Alternate is now part of [[Pennsylvania Route 32]] (PA 32). US 1 Alt. was created in 1953 after US 1 was moved to a freeway between Morrisville and the Brunswick Circle. By the 1980s, when the Trenton Freeway was extended to its current terminus, US 1 Bus. was created onto its current alignment and US 1 Alt. was removed through Trenton and Morrisville.

At the circle, the route turns northeast onto a four-lane divided highway and enters Lawrence Township.<ref name=SLD/> The road runs through residential and commercial areas, with a few intersections controlled by [[jughandle]]s. US 1 Bus. has an intersection with CR 616, which heads east to provide access to US 1. Further to the northeast, the settings become more commercial before US 1 Bus. merges into northbound US 1 at the northeast end of the Trenton Freeway.<ref name=SLD/><ref name=gmap/>

Despite the official route beginning at US 1 near the Brunswick Circle, signage has US 1 Bus. begin at the [[Lower Trenton Bridge]] over the [[Delaware River]], just north of the [[Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge]] (US 1). The continuation into Pennsylvania is State Route 2060 to the [[Pennsylvania Route 32|PA 32]] intersection in [[Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Morrisville]]. From the bridge, US 1 Bus. signage heads northeast on Bridge Street, with the road curving north onto Warren Street into downtown Trenton. At Livingston Street, the road becomes a [[one-way pair]] following Warren Street southbound and Broad Street northbound, [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with US 206. At the south end of [[New Jersey Route 31|Route 31]], the one-way pair becomes Brunswick Avenue northbound and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard southbound, heading northeast. These two roads are two-way, but carry only one direction of US 1 Bus./US 206. The one-way pair continues to the Brunswick Circle, where the official US 1 Bus. continues north. Strawberry Street is signed "to US 1 south" from the circle, and as US 1 Business north from US 1. Southbound US 1 Bus. leaves the circle with US 206 southbound on [[Brunswick Circle Extension]], merging with Princeton Avenue ([[County Route 583 (New Jersey)|CR 583]]). Officially, Brunswick Circle Extension is CR 645 and US 206 southbound bypasses the circle via Princeton Avenue, but all signage points US 206 through the circle. Northbound US 1 Business and US 206 simply enter the circle from Brunswick Avenue.<ref name=gmap2>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=brunswick+circle&daddr=40.220705,-74.765825+to:lower+trenton+bridge&hl=en&geocode=FbAZZgIdBHmL-ymZmcwJaFjBiTE7FJ0JxztqSg%3BFSG4ZQId_ymL-yk32hH2zlnBiTGUppVPEA2JoA%3BFaaOZQIdcROL-yGhMfdu8xUPLSkFSRTr3VnBiTGh2EfSd7ULPQ&mra=ls&sll=40.259617,-74.718189&sspn=0.05502,0.1684&ie=UTF8&ll=40.226204,-74.757328&spn=0.055047,0.1684&t=h&z=13&via=1|title=overview map of U.S. Route 1 Business through Trenton|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref>
