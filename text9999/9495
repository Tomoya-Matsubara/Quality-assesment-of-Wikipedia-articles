[[File:Val akv 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Aqueduct of [[Valens]]]]

The '''Valens Aqueduct''' ({{lang-tr|Bozdo<U+011F>an Kemeri}}, meaning "Aqueduct of the grey falcon"; {{lang-grc|<U+1F08><U+03B3><U+03C9><U+03B3><U+1F78><U+03C2> <U+03C4><U+03BF><U+1FE6> <U+1F55><U+03B4><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ''Ag<U+014D>g<U+00F3>s tou h<U+00FD>datos'', meaning simply "[[aqueduct]]") is a [[Roman aqueduct]] which was the major water-providing system of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] capital of [[Constantinople]] (modern [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]). Completed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Valens]] in the late 4th century AD, it was restored by several [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]]s, and is one of the most important landmarks of the city.

== Location ==
The aqueduct stands in Istanbul, in the quarter of [[Fatih]], and spans the valley between the hills occupied today by the [[Istanbul University]] and the [[Fatih Mosque]]. The surviving section is 921 meters long, about 50 meters less than the original length.<ref name=ma196>Mamboury (1953), p. 196.</ref> The ''Atat<U+00FC>rk Bulvar<U+0131>'' boulevard passes under its arches.

== History ==
=== Roman period ===
The construction of a water supply system for the city (then still called [[Byzantium]]) had begun already under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] emperor [[Hadrian]].<ref>Evans (1996), p. 30.</ref> Under [[Constantine I]], when the city was rebuilt and increased in size, the system needed to be greatly expanded to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population.<ref name=ma193>Mamboury (1953), p. 193.</ref>

The Valens aqueduct, which originally got its water from the slopes of the hills between [[Ka<U+011F><U+0131>thane]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]],<ref name=ma202>Mamboury (1953), p. 202.</ref> was merely one of the terminal points of this new wide system of aqueducts and canals - which eventually reached over 250 kilometers in total length, the longest such system of Antiquity - that stretched throughout the hill-country of [[Thrace]] and provided the capital with water. Once in the city, the water was stored in three open reservoirs and over a hundred underground [[cistern]]s, such as the [[Basilica Cistern]], with a total capacity of over 1 million cubic meters.<ref>Evans (1996), p. 31.</ref>

The exact date that construction on the aqueduct began is uncertain, but it was completed in the year 368 during the reign of Roman Emperor Valens, whose name it bears. It lay along the valley between the third and fourth hills of [[Constantinople]], occupied respectively at that time by the [[Capitolium of Constantinople|Capitolium]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].<ref name=mw273>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener (1977), p. 273.</ref> According to tradition, the aqueduct was built using the stones of the walls of [[Chalcedon]], pulled down as punishment in 366 after the [[Valens#Revolt of Procopius|revolt]] of [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]].<ref name=mw273/> The structure was inaugurated in the year 373 by the [[Praefectus urbis|urban prefect]] [[Clearchus (consul 384)|Clearchus]], who commissioned a ''[[Nymphaeum]] Maius'' in the [[Forum of Theodosius]], that was supplied with water from the aqueduct.<ref name=mw273/>{{cref|a}}

After a severe drought in 382, [[Theodosius I]] built a new line (the ''Aquaeductus Theodosiacus''), which took water from the northeastern region known today as the <U+201C>[[Belgrade Forest]]<U+201D>.<ref name=ma193/>

=== East Roman (Byzantine) period ===
Other works were executed under [[Theodosius II]], who decided to distribute the water of the aqueduct exclusively to the Nymphaeum, the [[Baths of Zeuxippus]] and the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]].<ref name=ma193/> The aqueduct, possibly damaged by an earthquake, was restored under [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Justinian I]], who connected it with the Cistern of the [[Basilica]] of [[Illus]]{{cref|b}} (identified today either with the ''[[Basilica Cistern|Yerebatan]]'' or with the ''[[Cistern of Philoxenos|Binbirdirek]]'' ({{lang-tr |Turkish}}): "thousand and one columns") cistern, and was repaired in 576 by [[Justin II]], who built a separate pipe.<ref name=mw273/><ref name=ma194>Mamboury (1953), p. 194.</ref>

The aqueduct was cut by the [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege of 626]], and the water supply was reestablished only after the great drought of 758 by Emperor [[Constantine V]].<ref name=mw273/> The Emperor had the whole water supply system repaired by a certain Patrikios, who used a large labour force coming from the whole of Greece and [[Anatolia]].<ref name=mw273/>

Other maintenance works were accomplished under Emperors [[Basil II]] (in 1019) and [[Romanos III Argyros]].<ref name=ma202/><ref name=mw274>M<U+00FC>ller-Wiener (1977), p. 274.</ref>

The last Byzantine Emperor who took care of the aqueduct was [[Andronikos I Komnenos]].<ref name=ma194/> Neither during the [[Latin Empire]] nor during the [[Palaiologan period]] were any repair works executed, but by that time the population of the city had shrunk to about 40,000 - 50,000 inhabitants, so that the water supply was no longer a very important issue.<ref name=ma202/> Nevertheless, according to [[Ruy Gonz<U+00E1>les de Clavijo]], a [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] diplomat who traveled to Constantinople en route to an embassy to [[Timur]] in 1403, the aqueduct was still functioning.<ref name=mw273/>

=== Ottoman period ===
[[File:Aqueduct of Valens.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Valens Aqueduct in the 19th century]]
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] (1453), Sultan [[Mehmet II]] repaired the whole water supply, which was then used to bring water to the imperial palaces of ''Eski Sarayi'' (the first palace, built on the third hill) and [[Topkap<U+0131> Palace|Topkap<U+0131> Sarayi]], and connected it with a new line coming from the northeast. The [[1509 Istanbul earthquake|great earthquake of 1509]] destroyed the arches near the [[<U+015E>ehzade Mosque|Mosque of <U+015E>ehzade]], which was erected some time later. This gave rise to the popular legend that they were cut, in order to allow a better view from the nearby mosque. The repairs to the water-supplying net continued under [[Beyazid II]], who added a new line.<ref name=mw274/>

Around the middle of the 16th century, [[Suleyman I]] rebuilt arches (now [[Ogive#Architecture|ogival]]) 47 up to 51 (counted from the west) near the [[<U+015E>ehzade Mosque]], and commissioned the Imperial Architect [[Mimar Sinan]] to add two more lines, coming from the Forest of Belgrade (''Belgrad Orman<U+0131>'').<ref name=ma202/> The increased flow allowed the distribution of water to the ''K<U+03B9>rk<U+00E7>e<U+015F>me'' ("Forty Fountains") quarter, situated along the aqueduct on the [[Golden Horn]] side, and so called after the many fountains built there under Suleyman.<ref name=ma202/>

Under Sultan [[Mustafa II]], five arches (41-45) were restored, respecting the ancient form. An inscription ''in situ'', dated 1696/97, commemorates the event.<ref name=mw274/> His successor [[Ahmed III]] repaired again the distribution net.<ref name=mw274/>

In 1912, a 50-meter-long part of the aqueduct near the Fatih Mosque was pulled down.<ref name=ma202/> In the same period, a new modern ''Taksim'' ("distribution plant", ''lit.'' [[Taksim Square#History|'division']]) at the east end was erected.<ref name=ma202/>

== Description ==
[[File:Valens aqu<U+00E4>dukt02.jpg|thumb|The Aqueduct of Valens]]

The Aqueduct of Valens had a length of 971 meters and a maximum height of ca. 29 meters (63 meters above sea level) with a constant slope of 1:1000.<ref name=mw273/> Arches 1-40 and 46-51 belong to the time of Valens, arches 41-45 to Mustafa II, and those between 52 and 56 to Suleyman I.<ref name= ey78>Eyice (1955), p. 78.</ref> Arches 18-73 have a double order, the others a single order.<ref name=mw273/><ref name=ey78/> 

Originally the structure ran perfectly straight, but during the construction of the [[Fatih Mosque]] - for unknown reasons - it was bent in that section.<ref name=ma203>Mamboury (1953), p. 203.</ref> The [[masonry]] is not regular, and uses a combination of [[ashlar]] blocks and [[brick]]s.<ref name=mw273/> The first row of arches is built with well-squared stone blocks, the upper row is built with four to seven courses of stones alternated with a bed of smaller material (''[[Cement|opus caementitium]]'') clamped with [[iron]] [[Clamp (tool)|cramps]].<ref name=ma203/> The width of the aqueduct varies  from 7.75 meters to 8.24 meters.<ref name=mw273/> The pillars are 3.70 meters thick, and the arches of the lower order are four meters wide.<ref name=ma203/>

The water comes from two lines from the northeast and one coming from the northwest, which join together outside the walls, near the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gates|Adrianople Gate (Edirne Kap<U+0131>)]].<ref name=ma196/> Near the east end of the aqueduct there is a distribution plant, and another lies near [[Hagia Sophia]]. The water feeds the zone of the imperial palace.<ref name=ma203/> The daily discharge in the 1950s amounted to 6,120 cubic meters.<ref name=ma203/> During Byzantine times, two roads important for the topography of medieval Constantinople crossed under the eastern section of the aqueduct.<ref name=ma203/>
