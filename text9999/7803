'''Typhoon Gay''', also known as the Kavali Cyclone of 1989,<ref name="IMDWind"/> was a small but powerful [[tropical cyclone]] that caused more than 800&nbsp;fatalities in and around the [[Gulf of Thailand]] in November 1989. The worst typhoon to affect the [[Malay Peninsula]] in 35&nbsp;years, Gay originated from a [[monsoon trough]] over the Gulf of Thailand in early November. Owing to favorable atmospheric conditions, the storm [[Rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]], attaining winds of more than 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph) by November 3.{{#tag:ref|All sustained wind speeds are based on 1-minute standards unless otherwise stated.|group="nb"}} Later that day, Gay became the first typhoon since 1891 to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in Thailand, striking [[Chumphon Province]] with winds of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph). The small storm emerged into the [[Bay of Bengal]] and gradually reorganized over the following days as it approached southeastern [[India]]. On November 8, Gay attained its peak intensity as a [[SSHS#Category 5|Category&nbsp;5<U+2013>equivalent]] cyclone with winds of 260&nbsp;km/h (160&nbsp;mph). The typhoon then moved ashore near [[Kavali]], [[Andhra Pradesh]]. Rapid weakening ensued inland, and Gay dissipated over [[Maharashtra]] early on November 10.

The typhoon's rapid development took hundreds of vessels in the Gulf of Thailand by surprise, leading to 275&nbsp;offshore fatalities. Of these, 91&nbsp;occurred after an oil drilling ship, the ''[[Drillship Seacrest|Seacrest]]'', capsized amid {{convert|6|<U+2013>|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} swells. Across the Malay Peninsula, 588 people died from various storm-related incidents. Several towns in coastal Chumphon were destroyed. Losses throughout Thailand totaled {{ntsp|11000000000||[[Thai Baht|<U+0E3F>]]}} ({{ntsp|496500000||US$}}).{{#tag:ref|All damage figures in the article are in 1989&nbsp;United States dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated.|group="nb"}} Striking India as a powerful cyclone, Gay damaged or destroyed about 20,000&nbsp;homes in [[Andhra Pradesh]], leaving 100,000&nbsp;people homeless. In that country, 69 deaths and {{ntsp|410000000||{{Indian Rupee|link=Indian Rupee}}}} ({{ntsp|25270000||US$}}) in damage were attributed to Gay.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Gay 1989 track.png}}
In early November, a [[monsoon trough]] over the [[Gulf of Thailand]] showed signs of [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. A small, concentrated area of [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] quickly developed over a [[low-pressure area]] within the trough, and on November&nbsp;2 it became sufficiently organized for the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center|Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)]] to issue a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]].{{#tag:ref|The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] is a joint [[United States Navy]]&nbsp;&ndash; [[United States Air Force]] task force that issues tropical cyclone warnings for the western Pacific Ocean and other regions.<ref>{{cite web|work=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|publisher=United States Navy|title=Joint Typhoon Warning Center Mission Statement|year=2011|accessdate=December 25, 2011|url=https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTWC_mission.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070726103400/https://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/menu/JTWC_mission.html|archivedate=July 26, 2007}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Owing to its small size, the system began strengthening within the narrow gulf by taking advantage of warm waters and good [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]]. Moving generally northwestward, it became a tropical depression later that day and underwent [[Rapid deepening|rapid intensification]]. As the newly named Tropical Storm Gay strengthened, it "presented a paradox to forecasters" according to [[Lieutenant]] Dianne K. Crittenden; [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic data]] from [[Malaysia]] and [[Thailand]] indicated decreasing wind speeds and increasing [[barometric pressure]]s around the storm, but these observations were later interpreted as increased [[Subsidence (atmosphere)|subsidence]].<ref name="ATCR">{{cite web|author=Lt.

The storm gradually restrengthened as it moved through an area of low [[wind shear]] and warm waters; however, this was limited by restrictions to the cyclone's outflow.<ref name="ATCR"/> Early on November&nbsp;6, Gay passed near the [[Andaman Islands]] as a [[SSHS#Category 2|Category&nbsp;2-equivalent]] cyclone.<ref name="JTWCBT"/>

After changing little in intensity for much of November&nbsp;6, Gay strengthened as the ridge to its north intensified and the previous restrictions to its outflow diminished.

Following post-storm surveys, it was determined that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120&nbsp;kgf/m<sup>2</sup> of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50&nbsp;years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within 5&nbsp;years.<ref name="1996rpt"/>
