The '''R512''' is a [[Regional Route (South Africa)|Regional Route]] in [[South Africa]]. Its northern origin is [[Brits, North West|Brits]], [[North West (South African province)|North West]], from which it leaves the [[R511 road (South Africa)|R511]] in a southerly direction. It meets, and is briefly co-signed with, the [[R104 road (South Africa)|R104]]. It departs to the south, west of the [[Hartbeespoort Dam]], where it gives off the south-westerly [[R560 road (South Africa)|R560]]. It turns east briefly, along the southern edge of the dam, before again heading south, crossing into [[Gauteng]]. Passing [[Lanseria International Airport]], the road then meets the [[R552 road (South Africa)|R552]] (Cedar Road), and forms and interchange with the [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]]. After crossing the highway and its old equivalent the [[R114 road (South Africa)|R114]], it heads towards [[Randburg]] part of [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Johannesburg Metropole]] as [[Malibongwe Drive]]. It passes through the lower-middle [[Cosmo City]] and [[Kya-Sand]] township before crossing the [[R562 road (South Africa)|R562]] and entering the more affluent [[Northriding]] and [[Olivedale, Gauteng|Olivedale]] suburbs. The R562 ends at an interchange with the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]], but Malibongwe Drive continues towards Johannesburg city centre.
