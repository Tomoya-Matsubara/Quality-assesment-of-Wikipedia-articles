The '''House of Plantagenet''' ({{IPAc-en|p|l|<U+00E6>|n|<U+02C8>|t|<U+00E6>|d<U+0292>|<U+0259>n|<U+0259>|t}} {{Respell|plan|TAJ|<U+0259>-n<U+0259>t}}) was a royal dynasty that came to prominence in the [[High Middle Ages]] and lasted until the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Within that period, some historians identify four distinct Royal Houses: [[Angevins]], Plantagenet, [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[House of York|York]].<ref name=TheAngevins>{{cite web|title= The Angevins | url = http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAngevins/TheAngevins.aspx | work = The Official Website of The British Monarchy}} 
</ref> 

The Plantagenet name for the dynasty dates from the 15th century and comes from a 12th-century nickname of Geoffrey. A common retrospective view is that [[Geoffrey V of Anjou]] founded the dynasty through his marriage to [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England]]. From the accession of their son, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], via the [[Treaty of Winchester]] that ended [[the Anarchy|decades of civil war]], a long line of 14 Plantagenet kings ruled England, until Richard III's death in 1485 (at the [[Battle of Bosworth]]). 
Henry II accumulated a vast and complex feudal holding with his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], which extended from the Pyrenees to Ireland and the border of Scotland, that was later called the [[Angevin Empire]]. 

The Plantagenets transformed England from a realm ruled from abroad, into one of a deeply engaged and mature kingdom, although not necessarily always intentionally.<ref name = Jonesp594>
{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=594}}</ref>
[[Winston Churchill]], the twentieth-century British prime minister, articulated this in ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples''; "[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of [[John of England|John]] than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns".<ref name = Churchill1958p190>
{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=190}}
</ref> 
From [[Magna Carta]] onward, the role of kingship transformed under the Plantagenet&mdash;driven by weakness to make compromises that constrained their power in return for financial and military support. The king changed from being the most powerful man in the country with the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare into a polity where the king's duties to his realm, in addition to the realm's duties to the king, were defined, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. Success for the Plantagenets required martial prowess, and many were renowned warrior leaders. Conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish was to help shape a distinct national identity and re-established the use of English. They also provided England with significant buildings such as [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Windsor Castle]] and the Welsh Castles.

No royal dynasty was as successful in passing the crown to a succeeding generation as the Plantagenets from 1189 to 1377. In 1399 the splintering of the dynasty into competing cadet branches, the [[House of York]] and [[House of Lancaster]], combined with economic and social tumult led to internecine strife later named the [[Wars of the Roses]]. 
Conclusive defeat in and the burden of taxes supporting the [[Hundred Years' War]] had devastated the English economy and broke confidence in the status quo. Several popular revolts demanded greater rights and freedoms for the general population. Destitute soldiery returned from France had turned to crime to survive, while [[feudalism]] declined into [[bastard feudalism]], where the nobility acquired private armies used to pursue personal feuds and defy the Plantagenet government. 
These events culminated in 1485 with the death of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the last Plantagenet king, at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]]. Many historians consider this as marking the end of Plantagenet power and the [[England in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages in England]] as the succeeding Tudors were able to resolve these problems by centralising royal power. This enabled the stability necessary for an [[English Renaissance]] and the development of [[Early modern Britain]].

==Origins==
{{See also|Angevins}}
[[File:Henry II Plantagenet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry II of England|Henry II]] became the first Plantagenet King of England.]]
The Angevins ({{IPAc-en|<U+00E6>|n|d<U+0292>|v|<U+026A>|n|s}}, meaning ''from [[Anjou]]'') were a family of [[Franks|Frankish]] origin descended from a ninth-century noble named [[Ingelger]]. They were [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou|Counts of Anjou]] since 870. The male line of Ingelger became extinct in 1060. The House of Plantagenet descended from a [[G<U+00E2>tinais|Count of G<U+00E2>tinais]] who married the sister of the last count of the [[House of Ingelger]].<ref name = Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name="vauchezsixtyfive">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}.</ref> [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V, Count of Anjou]], married his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Alice]] to the heir of [[Henry I of England]], [[William Adelin]], to address competition from Normandy but the prince drowned in the wreck of the [[White Ship]].<ref name = Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref> Fulk then wed his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother, [[Robert Curthose]]. Henry had this marriage annulled because of the threat of a rival claim to his throne. Finally, Fulk married his son and heir, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]], to Henry's daughter and only surviving child, Matilda. This brought about the convergence of the [[Angevins]], the [[House of Normandy]] and the [[House of Wessex]] to form the Plantagenet dynasty. Fulk then resigned his titles to Geoffrey and sailed to become [[King of Jerusalem]]. The chronicler [[Gerald of Wales]] borrowed elements of the [[Melusine]] legend to give a demonic origin to the Angevins, and several of them were prone to joke about the story.<ref name= Warren>{{harvnb|Warren|1978|p=2}}</ref>

It was [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York]], who adopted Plantagenet as a family name for him and his descendants in the 15th century. ''Plantegenest'' (or ''Plante Genest'') had been a 12th-century nickname of Geoffrey, perhaps because his emblem may have been the [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], (''planta genista'' in medieval Latin).<ref name=plant2007>{{harvnb|Plant|2007}}</ref> It is obscure why Richard chose this specific name but it emphasised Richard's hierarchal status as Geoffrey's (and six English kings') patrilineal descendant, during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey's male descendants was popular in Tudor times, perhaps encouraged by the added legitimacy it gave Richard's great grandson, [[Henry VIII of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|2001|p=206}}</ref>

==The Angevins come to England==
{{Main|Angevin Empire}}
[[File:France 1154 Eng.jpg|thumb|right|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands named as the "Angevin Empire"]]
[[Empress Matilda|Matilda's]] father Henry I of England named her as heir to his large holdings in what are now France and England.<ref name="hooper">{{harvnb|Hooper|1996|p=50}}</ref> But on Henry's death her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] had himself proclaimed King.<ref name=Schama2000p117>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=117}}</ref> Geoffrey showed little interest in England, but he supported Matilda by entering Normandy to claim her inheritance.<ref name="Grant">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> Matilda landed in England to challenge Stephen and was declared "Lady of the English" which resulted in [[the Anarchy|a civil war called the Anarchy]]. When Matilda was forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], Stephen was re-crowned. Matilda was never crowned as the English conflict continued inconclusively. However, Geoffrey secured the [[Duchy of Normandy]]. Matilda's son, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], by his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] had acquired the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] and was now immensely rich. With skilful negotiation with the war-weary Barons of England and King Stephen, he agreed to the [[Treaty of Wallingford]] and was recognised as Stephen's heir.<ref>{{harvnb|Ashley|2003|p=73}}.</ref>

Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the Church in England by reasserting the privileges held by Henry I when [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, by appointing his friend, [[Thomas Becket]] to the post. Henry had clashed with the church over whether Bishops could excommunicate royal officials without his permission and whether he could try clerics without them appealing to Rome. However, Becket opposed Henry's [[Constitutions of Clarendon]] and fled into exile. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soon soured again when Becket saw the crowning as [[coregent]] of Henry's son by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. On hearing the news Henry uttered the infamous phrase "What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low born clerk". In response to please Henry three of his men murdered Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]], probably by misadventure after Becket resisted a botched arrest attempt.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref> In Christian Europe Henry was considered complicit in this crime making him a pariah and he was forced to make a dramatic exhibition of penance, publicly walking barefoot into the cathedral and allowing monks to scourge him.<ref name="Schama2000p117" />

In 1155 [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland in order to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref> This was not a matter of urgency until Henry allowed [[Dermot MacMurrough|Dermot of Leinster]] to recruit soldiers in England and Wales for use in Ireland including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]] known as Strongbow. These knights took on the role of colonisers accruing autonomous power which concerned Henry. When Dermot died in 1171 Strongbow, as his son-in-law, seized significant territory. In response, and also to escape the controversary caused by the murder of Becket, Henry landed and re-established all fiefs and jurisdictions in Ireland were held subordinate to him as High King.<ref name=Jones2012p79>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=79<U+2013>80}}</ref>

When Henry II attempted to give his land-less youngest son, John, a wedding gift of three castles it prompted his three eldest sons and wife to rebel in the [[Revolt of 1173<U+2013>1174]]. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] encouraged the three elder sons to destabilise his mightiest subject and not to wait for their inheritances. [[William the Lion]] and disgruntled subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt for their own ends. It was only after eighteen months of conflict that Henry II was able to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82<U+2013>92}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182 Henry II gathered his children to plan for [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son, also called Henry, would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany and John would receive Ireland. This broke down into further conflict and [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again, but died of [[dysentery]]. In 1186 Geoffrey died as a result of a tournament accident but still Henry was still reluctant to have a sole heir <ref name=Jones2012p86>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=86}}</ref> so, in 1189, Richard and [[Philip II of France]] took advantage of a sickening Henry II with more success. Henry II was forced to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as sole heir. When Henry II died shortly afterwards his last words to Richard were allegedly "God grant that I may not die until I have my revenge on you".<ref name=Jones2012p109>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=109}}</ref>

==Angevin decline==
{{Main|Richard I of England|John, King of England}}
[[File:Seal - Richard I of England.jpg|thumb|[[Richard I of England|Richard I]]'s [[Great Seal]] of 1189]]On the day of Richard's English coronation there was a mass slaughter of the Jews, described by [[Richard of Devizes]] as a "holocaust".<ref name=Ackroyd2000>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|2000|p=54}}</ref> Quickly putting the affairs of the Angevin Empire in order he departed on Crusade to the Middle East in early 1190. Opinions of Richard amongst his contemporaries was mixed. He had rejected and humiliated the King of France's sister; deposed the well-connected King of Cyprus and afterwards sold the island; insulted and refused spoils of the [[third crusade]] to nobles like [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], and was rumoured to have arranged the assassination of [[Conrad of Montferrat]]. His cruelty was demonstrated by his massacre of 2,600 prisoners in Acre.<ref name=Jones2012p128>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=128}}</ref> However, Richard was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners. He achieved victories in the [[Third Crusade]] but failed to capture Jerusalem, retreating from the Holy Land with a small band of followers.<ref name="rich">{{harvnb|Carlton|2003|p=42}}</ref> Richard was captured on his return journey by Leopold. Custody was passed to [[Henry the Lion]] and a tax of 25% of movables and income was required to pay the ransom of 100,000 marks, with a promise of 50,000 more. Philip II of France had overrun great swathes of Normandy while [[John, King of England|John of England]] controlled much of the remainder of Richard's lands. But, on his return to England, Richard forgave John and re-established his control. Leaving England in 1194 never to return, Richard battled Phillip for the next five years for the return of the holdings seized during his incarceration. Close to total victory he was injured by an arrow during the siege of [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Ch<U+00E2>lus-Chabrol]] and died after lingering injured for ten days.<ref name=Jones2012>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=146}}</ref>

Richard's failure in his duty to provide an heir caused a succession crisis. Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine choose Richard's nephew and nominated heir [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]], while John succeeded in England and Normandy. Yet again Philip II of France took the opportunity to destabilise the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland and supported his vassal Arthur's claim to the English crown. When Arthur's forces threatened his mother, John won a significant victory, capturing the entire rebel leadership at the [[battle of Mirebeau]].<ref name=Turnet1994p100>{{harvnb|Turner|1994|pp=100}}</ref> Arthur was murdered, it was rumoured by John's own hands, and his sister [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]] would spend the rest of her life in captivity. John's behaviour drove numerous of the French Barons to side with Phillip and resultant rebellions by the Norman and Angevin barons broke his control of the continental possessions leading to the de facto end of the [[Angevin Empire]], even though Henry III would maintain the claim until 1259.<ref name=Jones2012p161>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=161<U+2013>169}}</ref>

After re-establishing his authority in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou. The strategy was to draw the French from Paris while another army, under [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in one of the most decisive and symbolic battles in French history.<ref name=Favier>{{harvnb|Favier|1993|p=176}}</ref> The battle had both important and high profile consequences.<ref name=Contramine>{{harvnb|Contramine|1992|p=83}}</ref> John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown while King John agreed a five-year truce. Philip's decisive victory was crucial in ordering politics in both England and France. The battle was instrumental in forming the [[absolute monarchy in France]].<ref name=Smedley1836>{{harvnb|Smedley|1836|p=72}}</ref>

===Magna Carta and the First Barons War===
{{main|Magna Carta|First Barons' War}}
[[File:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|thumb|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text of [[Magna Carta]]]]
John's defeats in France weakened his position in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the treaty called [[Magna Carta]], which limited royal power and established common law. This would form the basis of every constitutional battle through the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=217}}.</ref> However, both the barons and the crown failed to abide by the terms of Magna Carta, leading to the [[First Barons' War]] in which the rebel barons invited an invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]]. This is considered by some historians to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty with John's death and William Marshall's appointment as the protector of the nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref name=TheAngevins>{{cite web|title=The official website of The British Monarchy|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensofEngland/TheAngevins/TheAngevins.aspx|work=The Angevins|publisher=The Royal Household <U+00A9> Crown Copyright}}</ref> Marshall won the war with victories at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Dover (1217)|Dover]] in 1217, leading to the [[Treaty of Lambeth]] by which Louis renounced his claims.<ref name=Jones221>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=221<U+2013>222}}.</ref> In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued the ''Magna Carta'' agreement as a basis for future government.<ref name=DanzigerGillingham>{{harvnb|DanzigerGillingham|2003|p=271}}.</ref>

The Henry III exhibited typical Plantagent and Medieval [[History of the Jews in England (1066<U+2013>1290)|antisemitism]] Henry exacting heavy Jewish taxation between 1219 and 1272 totaling 200,000 marks, a vast sum of money.<ref name="Rubenstein_1996_37" /> Henry made repeated unsuccessful attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou.<ref name="CarpenterP270">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=270}}.</ref> Despite the [[1217 Treaty of Lambeth]], hostilities continued and Henry was forced to make significant constitutional concessions to the newly crowned Louis VIII of France and Henry's stepfather [[Hugh X of Lusignan]]. Between them, they overran much of the remnants of Henry's continental holdings, further eroding the Angevin's grip on the continent. Henry saw such similarities between himself and England's then patron saint [[Edward the Confessor]] in his struggle with his nobles<ref name=Jones234>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=234<U+2013>235}}</ref> that he gave his first son the Anglo-Saxon name Edward and built the saint a magnificent still-extant shrine.<ref name=Schama2000p172>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=172}}</ref>

[[File:WLA vanda Cast of Tomb Effigy Henry III.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of the effigy of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in Westminster Abbey, c. 1272]]
The barons were resistant to the supply of the men and money required to support a foreign war to restore Plantagenet holdings on the continent. In order to motivate his barons, and facing a repeat of the situation his father faced, Henry III reissued Magna Carta and the [[Charter of the Forest]] in return for a tax that raised the incredible sum of <U+00A3>45,000. This was enacted in an assembly of the barons, bishops and magnates that created a compact in which the feudal prerogatives of the King were debated and discussed in the political community.<ref name=Jones2012p227>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=227}}</ref> The pope had offered Henry's brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] but he recognised that the cost of making this claim real was prohibitive. [[Matthew Paris]] wrote that Richard responded to the price by saying, "You might as well say, 'I make you a present of the moon&nbsp;<U+2013> step up to the sky and take it down'". Instead, Henry purchased the kingdom for his son [[Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster]], which angered many powerful barons. Henry left a longer lasting legacy in his building projects that cost <U+00A3>3,000 a year or a tenth of his income,<ref name=Jones2012p237>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=237}}</ref> including [[Westminster Abbey]], [[Windsor Castle]] and the town of [[Harwich]]. Bankrupted by his military expenses, Henry was forced to agree to the [[Provisions of Oxford]] by barons led by his brother in law, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms. He was also forced to agree to the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] with [[Louis IX of France]], acknowledging the loss of the [[Dukedom of Normandy]], Maine, Anjou and Poitou, but retaining the [[Channel Islands]]. The treaty held that "islands (if any) which the King of England should hold", he would retain "as peer of France and Duke of Aquitaine"<ref name=UnitedNations>{{harvnb|United Nations|1992}}</ref> In exchange Louis withdrew his support for English rebels, ceded three bishoprics and cities and was to pay an annual rent for possession of [[Agenais]].<ref name=Rothwell1975>{{harvnb|Rothwell|1975|pp=527<U+2013>539}}</ref> Disagreements about the meaning of the treaty began as soon as it was signed.<ref name=Lauterpacht>{{harvnb|Lauterpacht|1957|Page=130}}</ref> The agreement resulted in English kings having to pay homage to the French monarch, thus remaining French vassals, but only on French soil. This was one of the indirect causes of the [[Hundred Years War]].<ref name=MKeen>{{cite web|last=Keen|first=Maurice|title=The Hundred Years War|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/hundred_years_war_01.shtml|work=BBC History|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

===Second Barons War and the establishment of Parliament===

[[File:Montfort Evesham.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Death and mutilation of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] at the [[Battle of Evesham]]]]
Friction intensified between the barons and the King, and Henry repudiated the Provisions of Oxford in 1261. Henry obtained a [[papal bull]] in 1261 exempting him from his oath, and both sides began to raise armies. [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]], Henry's eldest son, was tempted to side with his godfather Simon de Montfort, and supported holding a Parliament in his father's absence, before he decided to side with his father. The barons under de Montfort captured most of south-eastern England and at the [[Battle of Lewes]] in 1264, Henry and Edward were defeated and taken prisoner. De Montfort summoned the [[De Montfort's Parliament|Great Parliament]], regarded as the first Parliament worthy of the name because it was the first time cities and burghs sent representatives.<ref name=Schama2000p181>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=181}}</ref> Edward escaped, raised an army and defeated and killed de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2007|p=101}}.</ref> Savage retribution was exacted on the rebels and authority was restored to King Henry. Edward, having pacified the realm, left England to join Louis IX on the [[Ninth Crusade]], funded by an unprecedented levy of one-twentieth of every citizen's movable goods and possessions. He was one of the last crusaders in the tradition of aiming to recover the Holy Lands. Louis died before Edward's arrival, but Edward decided to continue. The result was an anti-climax and Edward's small force limited him to the relief of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and a handful of raids. Surviving a murder attempt by an [[Assassins|assassin]], Edward left for Sicily later in the year and was never to return on crusade. The stability of England's political structure was demonstrated when Henry III died and his son succeeded as Edward I; the barons swore allegiance to Edward even though he did not return for two years.<ref name=Jones2012p293>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=293}}</ref>

From the beginning of his reign Edward I sought to organise his inherited territories. As a devotee of the cult of [[King Arthur]] he also attempted to enforce claims to primacy within the British Isles. Wales consisted of a number of [[Principality|princedoms]], often in conflict with each other. [[Llywelyn the Last|Llywelyn ap Gruffydd]] held north Wales in fee to the English king under the Treaty of Woodstock, but had taken advantage of the English civil wars to consolidate his position as Prince of Wales and maintained that his principality was 'entirely separate from the rights' of England. Edward considered Llywelyn 'a rebel and disturber of the peace'. Edward's determination, military experience and skilful use of ships ended Welsh independence by driving Llywelyn into the mountains. He later died in battle. The [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] extended the shire system, bringing Wales into the English legal framework. When Edward's son was born he was proclaimed as the first English [[Prince of Wales]]. Edward's Welsh campaign produced one of the largest armies ever assembled by an English king in a formidable combination of heavy Anglo-Norman cavalry and Welsh archers that laid the foundations of later military victories in France. Edward spent around <U+00A3>173,000 on his two Welsh campaigns, largely on a network of castles to secure his control.<ref name=Jones2012p314>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=314}}</ref>

===Constitutional change and the reform of feudalism===
{{Main|Edward I of England}}
Because of his legal reforms Edward is sometimes called ''The English [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'',<ref name="caterhistory"/> although whether he was a reformer or an autocrat responding to events is debated. His campaigns left him in debt. This necessitated that he gain wider national support for his policies among lesser landowners, merchants and traders so that he could raise taxation through frequently summoned Parliaments. When [[Philip IV of France]] confiscated the [[Gascony|duchy of Gascony]] in 1294, more money was needed to wage war in France and Edward summoned a precedent setting assembly known as the Model Parliament, which including barons, clergy, knights and townspeople.<ref name="caterhistory">{{harvnb|Carter|1986|p=71}}.</ref>

Edward imposed his authority on the Church with the [[Statutes of Mortmain]] that prohibited the donation of land to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. He also emphasised the role of Parliament and the common law through significant legislation, a [[Hundred Rolls|survey of local government]] and the codification of laws originating from Magna Carta with the [[Statute of Westminster 1275]]. Edward also enacted economic reforms on wool exports to take customs which amounted to nearly <U+00A3>10,000 a year and imposed licence fees on gifts of land to the Church. Feudal jurisdiction was regulated by the [[Statute of Gloucester]] and [[Quo Warranto]]. The [[Statute of Winchester]] enforced Plantagenet policing authority. The [[Statute of Westminster 1285]] kept estates within families: tenants only held property for life and were unable to sell the property.

===Anglo-Scottish wars===
{{main|Wars of Scottish Independence}}
[[Image:Gal nations edward i.jpg|thumb|upright|Edward imposed his authority over church and feudal society, annexed Wales and invaded Scotland]]
Edward asserted that the King of Scotland owed him feudal allegiance, which embittered Anglo-Scottish relations for the rest of his reign. Edward intended to create a [[dual monarchy]] by marrying his son [[Edward II of England|Edward]] to [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], who was the sole heir of [[Alexander III of Scotland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1995|p=89}}.</ref> When Margaret died there was no obvious heir to the Scottish throne. Edward was invited by the Scottish magnates to resolve the dispute. Edward obtained recognition from the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|competitors for the Scottish throne]] that he had the 'sovereign lordship of Scotland and the right to determine our several pretensions' deciding the case in favour of [[John Balliol]] who duly swore loyalty to him and became king.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|1995|p=90}}.</ref></ref> Edward insisted that Scotland was not independent and as sovereign lord he had the right to hear in England appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. In 1295 John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France.<ref name=MacDougall2001>{{harvnb|MacDougall|2001|p=9}}</ref> In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing and exiling Balliol.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=329}}.</ref>

Edward was less successful in Gascony, which was overrun by the French. His commitments were beginning to outweigh his resources. Chronic debts had been incurred by wars against France, in Flanders and Gascony and in Britain in Wales and Scotland; the clergy refused to pay their share of the costs, with the Archbishop of Canterbury threatening excommunication; Parliament was reluctant to contribute to Edward's expensive and unsuccessful military policies; [[Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford]], and [[Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk]], refused to serve in Gascony, and the barons presented a formal statement of their grievances. Edward was forced to reconfirm the Charters (including Magna Carta) to obtain the money he required. A truce and peace treaty the French king restored the duchy of Gascony to Edward. Meanwhile [[William Wallace]] had risen in Balliol's name and recovered most of Scotland, before being defeated at the [[Battle of Falkirk (1298)|Battle of Falkirk]].<ref name="historytoday">{{harvnb|Gardiner|2000|p=275}}.</ref> Edward summoned a full Parliament, including elected Scottish representatives for the settlement of Scotland. The new government in Scotland featured [[Robert the Bruce]], but he rebelled and was crowned king of Scotland. Despite failing health, Edward was carried north to pursue another campaign, but he died en route at [[Burgh by Sands]].<ref name="historytoday"/> Even though Edward had requested that his bones should be carried on Scottish campaigns and that his heart be taken to the Holy Land, he was buried at Westminster Abbey in a plain black marble tomb that in later years was painted with the words Scottorum malleus (Hammer of the Scots) and Pactum serva (Honour the vow).<ref name=Jones2012p362>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=362}}</ref>

{{Main|Hundred Years' War}}

[[File:Philip iv and family.jpg|thumb|right|Isabella, third from left, with her father, Philip IV, her future French king brothers, and King Philip's brother, Charles of Valois]]
The [[War of Saint-Sardos]]' was a short conflict between Edward and the [[France in the Middle Ages|Kingdom of France]] that led indirectly to his overthrow. The French monarchy used the jurisdiction of the [[Parlement of Paris]] to overrule decisions of the nobility's courts. As a French vassal Edward felt this encroachment in Gascony with the French kings adjudicating disputes between him and his French subjects. Without confrontation he could do little but watch the duchy shrink. [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent]], decided to resist one such judgement in [[Saint-Sardos, Lot-et-Garonne|Saint-Sardos]] with the result that Charles IV declared the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]], was sent to negotiate and agreed a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son, [[Edward III of England|Edward]], who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites and also formed a relationship with [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]].<ref name=Jones2012p411>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=411<U+2013>413}}</ref> The couple invaded England and joined by [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], captured the king.<ref name=Mortimer>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2003|pp=154, 160<U+2013>162}}</ref> Edward II abdicated on the condition that son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer.

===Hundred Years' War (1337<U+2013>60)&nbsp;<U+2013> The Edwardian phase===
{{Main| Hundred Years' War (1337<U+2013>1360)}}
[[File:Battle of crecy froissart.jpg|thumb|left|The victory at [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy|Cr<U+00E9>cy]] was an important Plantagenet success of the [[Hundred Years' War (1337<U+2013>1360)|Edwardian War]] in France.]]
In 1328 [[Charles IV of France]] died without a male heir. His cousin [[Philip VI of France|Phillip of Valois]] and [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]] on behalf of her son Edward were the major claimants to the throne. Philip, as senior grandson of [[Philip III of France]] in the male line, became king over Edward's claim as a [[matrilineal]] grandson of Philip IV of France, following the precedents of Philip V's succession over his niece [[Joan II of Navarre]] and Charles IV's succession over his nieces. Not yet in power, Edward III paid homage to Phillip as Duke of Aquitaine and the French king continued to assert feudal pressure on Gascony.<ref name=Prestwichp304>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=304}}</ref> Philip demanded that Edward extradite an exiled French advisor, [[Robert III of Artois]], and, when he refused, declared Edward's lands in Gascony and [[Ponthieu]] forfeit<ref name=Prestwichp306>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=306}}</ref> In response Edward put together a coalition of continental supporters, promising payment of over <U+00A3>200,000.<ref name=Prestwichp310>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=310<U+2013>311}}</ref> Edward borrowed heavily from the banking houses of the [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]], merchants in the Low Countries and [[William de la Pole (Chief Baron of the Exchequer)|William de la Pole]], a wealthy merchant who came to the king's rescue by advancing him <U+00A3>110,000<ref name=Prestwichp273>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=272, 273, 502, 503}}</ref> Edward also asked Parliament for a grant of <U+00A3>300,000 in return for further concessions.<ref name=Ackroyd2011>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|2000|p=256}}</ref>

The delay caused by fundraising allowed the French to invade Gascony, and threaten the English ports<ref name=Prestwichp311>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=311}}</ref> while the English conducted widespread [[English Channel naval campaign (1338<U+2013>1339)|piracy in the Channel]].<ref name=Sumption>{{harvnb|Sumption|1990|pp=264<U+2013>265}}</ref> Edward proclaimed himself King of France to encourage the Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French King, and won a significant naval victory at the [[Battle of Sluys]], where the French fleet was almost completely destroyed. Inconclusive fighting continued at the [[Battle of Saint-Omer]] and the [[Siege of Tournai (1340)]], but with both sides running out of money, the fighting ended with the [[Truce of Espl<U+00E9>chin]]. Edward III had achieved nothing of military value and English political opinion was against him. Bankrupt, he cut his losses ruining many whom he could not, or chose not to, repay.<ref name=Jones2012p471>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=471}}</ref>

Both countries suffered from war exhaustion. The tax burden had been heavy and the wool trade had been disrupted. Edward spent the following years paying off his immense debt, while the Gascons merged the war with banditry. In 1346 Edward invaded from the Low Countries using the strategy of [[chevauch<U+00E9>e]], a large extended raid for plunder and destruction that would be deployed by the English throughout the war. The chevauch<U+00E9>e discredited Philip VI of France's government and threatened to detach his vassals from loyalty. Edward fought two successful actions, the [[Storming of Caen]] and the [[Battle of Blanchetaque]]. He then found himself outmanoeuvred and outnumbered by Philip and was forced to fight at [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy|Cr<U+00E9>cy]]. The battle was a crushing defeat for the French, leaving Edward free to capture the important port of [[Calais]]. A subsequent victory against Scotland at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] resulted in the capture of [[David II of Scotland|David II]] and reduced the threat from Scotland.<ref name=Jones2012p476>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=476}}</ref>

The [[Black Death in England]] brought a halt to Edward's campaigns by killing between a third and more than half of his subjects.<ref name=Prestwichp531>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=531<U+2013>532, 550}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Campbell|1991|pp=48<U+2013>49}}</ref> The only Plantagenet known to have died from the Black Death was Edward III's daughter [[Joan of England (1335-1348)|Joan]] on her way to marry [[Pedro of Castile]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Horrox|1989|p=246}}</ref> The King passed the [[Ordinance of Labourers]] and the [[Statute of Labourers 1351|Statute of Labourers]] in response to the shortage of labour and social unrest that followed the plague.<ref name=Prestwichp548>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=548}}</ref> The labour laws were ineffectively enforced and the repressive measures caused resentment. Edward also encouraged the re-adoption of English as the official language of royal courts and parliaments with the [[Pleading in English Act 1362|Statute of Pleading]] transforming the language from one of the serfs into one fit for poetry and scholarship. Among others the [[Pearl Poet]], [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Gower]] and [[William Langland]] created a distinctive [[English culture]] and [[English art|art]].<ref name=Jones2012>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=}}</ref>

[[Edward, the Black Prince]], resumed the war with one of the most destructive chevauch<U+00E9>es in Plantagenet history. Starting from Bordeaux he laid waste to the lands of Armagnac before turning eastward into Languedoc. Toulouse prepared for a siege, but the Prince's army was not equipped for one, so he bypassed the city and continued south, pillaging and burning. Unlike large cities such as Toulouse, the rural French villages were not organised to provide a defence, making them much more attractive targets. In a second great chevauch<U+00E9>e the Prince burned the suburbs of Bourges without capturing the city, before marching west along the Loire River to Poitiers where the [[Battle of Poitiers]] resulted in a decisive English victory and the capture of [[John II of France]]. The [[Second Treaty of London]] was signed, which promised a four million <U+00E9>cus ransom. It was guaranteed by the Valois family hostages being held in London, while John returned to France to raise his ransom. Edward gained possession of Normandy, Brittany, Anjou, Maine and the coastline from Flanders to Spain, restoring the lands of the former Angevin Empire. The hostages quickly escaped back to France so John, horrified that his word had been broken, returned to England and died there. Edward invaded France in an attempt to take advantage of the popular rebellion of the [[Jacquerie]] hoping to seize the throne. However, although no French army stood against him, he was unable to take Paris or [[Rheims]]. In the subsequent [[Treaty of Br<U+00E9>tigny]] he renounced his claim to the French crown, but greatly expanded his territory in Aquitaine and confirmed his conquest of Calais.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lauterpacht|1957|p=130}}</ref>

Fighting in the Hundred Years' War often spilled from the French and Plantagenet lands into surrounding realms. This included the dynastic conflict in Castile between [[Peter of Castile]] and [[Henry II of Castile]]. Edward, Prince of Wales allied himself with Peter, defeating Henry at the [[Battle of N<U+00E1>jera]] before falling out with Peter, who had no means to reimburse him, leaving Edward bankrupt. The Plantagenets continued to interfere and [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], the Black Prince's brother, married Peter's daughter [[Infanta Constance of Castile|Constance]], claiming the Crown of Castile in the name of his wife. He arrived with an army and asked [[John I of Castile|John I]] to give up the throne in favour of Constance. John declined, instead his son married John of Gaunt's daughter, [[Catherine of Lancaster]], creating the title [[Prince of Asturias]] for the couple.<ref name=Weir102>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=102}}</ref>

A group of [[magnates]] consisting of the king's uncle [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester]], [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel]], and [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick]], became known as the [[Lords Appellant]] when they sought to impeach five of the King's favourites and restrain what was increasingly seen as tyrannical and capricious rule.<ref name="richtwo">{{harvnb|Saul|1997|p=203}}.</ref> Later they were joined by [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], the son and heir of John of Gaunt, and [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk]]. Initially, they were successful in establishing a commission to govern England for one year, but they were forced to rebel against King Richard, defeating an army under [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland|Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford]], at the skirmish of [[Radcot Bridge (Battle)|Radcot Bridge]]. Richard was reduced to a figurehead with little power. As a result of the [[Merciless Parliament]], de Vere and [[Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk]], who had fled abroad, were sentenced to death in their absence, [[Alexander Neville|Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York]], had all his worldly goods confiscated and a number of Richard's council were executed. Following John of Gaunt's return from Spain, Richard was able to rebuild his power, having Gloucester murdered in captivity in Calais. Warwick was stripped of his title and Bolingbroke and Mowbray were exiled.<ref name="richtwo"/>

===End of Plantagenet main line===
When John of Gaunt died in 1399, [[Richard II of England|Richard]] disinherited [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]], who invaded England in response with a small force that quickly grew in numbers and, meeting little resistance, he deposed Richard to have himself crowned Henry IV of England.

Henry IV died in 1413. His son and successor, [[Henry V of England]] was a successful and ruthless martial leader. Aware that [[Charles VI of France]]'s mental illness had caused instability in France, he invaded to assert the Plantagenet claims, captured [[Harfleur]], made a chevauch<U+00E9>e to Calais and won a near total victory over the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], despite being outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and low on supplies.<ref name=Schama265 >{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=265}}</ref> In subsequent years Henry recaptured much of Normandy and successfully secured marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. The resulting [[Treaty of Troyes]] stated that Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France. However, conflict continued with the [[Charles VII of France|Dauphin]] and Henry's brother [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], was killed in the defeat at the [[battle of Baug<U+00E9>]] in 1421. When Henry died in 1422, possibly with dysentery, he was succeeded by his nine-month old son as [[Henry VI of England]]. The elderly Charles VI of France died two months later. Led by Henry's brother [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], there were several more victories, such as the [[Battle of Verneuil]], in 1424, but it was impossible to maintain campaigning at this level. [[Joan of Arc]]'s involvement helped force the lifting of the siege of Orleans.<ref name=Davies76>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|pp=76<U+2013>80}}</ref> French victory at the [[Battle of Patay]] enabled the Dauphin to be crowned at [[Reims]] and continue the successful [[Fabian tactics]], avoiding full frontal assaults and exploiting logistical advantage. Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned at the stake.<ref name=Weir1995p82>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=82<U+2013>83}}</ref>

During the minority of Henry VI the war caused political division amongst the legitimate and illegitimate Plantagenets. Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, [[Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester]], just Calais, but [[Cardinal Beaufort]] wanted peace.<ref name=Weir1995p72>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=72<U+2013>76}}</ref> This division led to Gloucester's wife being accused of using witchcraft with the aim of putting him on the throne and he was later arrested and died in prison.<ref name=Weir1995p122>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=122<U+2013>32}}</ref> The refusal to renounce the Plantagenet claim to the French crown at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]] enabled the former Plantagenet ally [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]], to reconcile with Charles, while giving Charles time to reorganise his feudal levies into a modern professional army that would put its superior numbers to good use.<ref name=Weir1995p86>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=86,101}}</ref> The French retook Rouen and Bordeaux, regained Normandy, won the [[Battle of Formigny]] in 1450<ref name=Weir1995p156>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=156}}</ref> and with victory at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in 1453 brought an end to the war.<ref name=Weir1995p172>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=172}}</ref>

Henry VI was a weak king vulnerable to the over-mighty subjects, created by the decline of [[Feudalism]] into [[bastard feudalism]], who took advantage of the [[feudal levy]] being replaced by taxation to develop private armies of liveried retainers. The result was rivalries often over spilled from the courtroom into armed confrontations such as [[Percy<U+2013>Neville feud]].<ref name=Schama266>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=266}}</ref> The common interest given by the war in France had ended so Richard, Duke of York, and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], used their networks to defy the crown while the gentry attached themselves to different factions depending on their private feuds. Henry became the focus of discontent, as population, agricultural production, prices, wool trade and credit declined in the [[Great Slump (15th century)|Great Slump]].<ref name=Hicks44>{{harvnb|Hicks|2010|p=44}}</ref> Most seriously, in 1450 [[Jack Cade]] raised a rebellion in an attempt to force the King to address economic problems or abdicate his throne.<ref name=Weir147>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=147<U+2013>155}}</ref> The uprising was suppressed, but remained deeply unsettling with more radical demands coming from [[John and William Merfold]].<ref name=Mate156>{{harvnb|Mate|2006|p=156}}</ref>

===Wars of the Roses===
{{main|Wars of the Roses}}
[[File:Choosing the Red and White Roses.jpg|right|thumb|Symbolic representation of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in art]]
[[Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York]]'s attitude to the marriage contract of Henry and [[Margaret of Anjou]], which included the surrender of Maine and an extended the truce with France, contributed to his appointment as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. This conveniently removed him from English and French politics on which he had influence as a descendent of both Lionel, Duke of Clarence, and [[Edmund of Langley|Edmund, Duke of York]].<ref name="croftonrichduke">{{harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=112}}.</ref> Conscious of the fate of Duke Humphrey at the hands of the Beauforts, and suspicious that Henry intended to nominate [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]], as heir presumptive in his stead, he recruited militarily on his return to England. Richard claimed to be a reformer but was possibly plotting against his enemy Somerset. Armed conflict was avoided because Richard lacked aristocratic support and he was forced to swear allegiance to Henry. However, when Henry had a mental breakdown, Richard was named regent. Henry himself was trusting and not a man of war, but Margaret was more assertive, showing open enmity toward Richard, particularly after the birth of a male heir that resolved the succession question.<ref name="croftonrichdukeeleven">{{harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=111}}.</ref>

When Henry's sanity returned the court party reasserted its authority, but Richard of York and the Nevilles, who were related by marriage and had been alienated by Henry's support of the Percys, defeated them at a skirmish called the [[First Battle of St Albans]]. Possibly as few as 50 men were killed, but among them were Somerset and the two Percy lords, [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford]], creating feuds that would prove impossible to reconcile; reputedly Clifford's son would later murder Richard's son Edmund. The ruling class was deeply shocked and reconciliation was attempted.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=31}}.</ref> However, threatened with treason charges and lacking support, York, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, fled abroad. The Nevilles returned, winning the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] and capturing Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=38}}.</ref> When Richard joined them he surprised Parliament by claiming the throne and then forcing through the [[Act of Accord]], which stated that Henry would remain as monarch for his lifetime, but that York would succeed him. Margaret found this disregarding of her son's claims unacceptable and so the conflict continued. York was killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and his head set on display at [[Micklegate Bar]], [[York]] along with those of [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who had both been captured and beheaded.<ref name=Weir257>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=257}}</ref>

===House of York===
{{main|House of York}}
[[File:Copper-alloy boar mount from the Thames foreshore (London).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bronze]] [[boar]] mount thought to have been worn by a supporter of Richard III, often described as the last Plantagenet king]]
The Scottish queen [[Mary of Guelders]] provided Margaret with support and a Scottish army pillaged into southern England.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=57}}.</ref> London resisted in the fear of being plundered and then enthusiastically welcomed York's son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]], with Parliament confirming that Edward should be made king.<ref name="crowned">{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=1}}.</ref> Edward was crowned after consolidating his position with victory at the [[Battle of Towton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=147}}.</ref> Edward's preferment of the former Lancastrian-supporting Woodville family, following his marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]], led to Warwick and Clarence helping Margaret depose Edward and return Henry to the throne. Edward and [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], fled, but on their return Clarence switched sides at the [[Battle of Barnet]] leading to the death of the Neville brothers. The subsequent [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] brought the demise of the last of the male line of the Beauforts. The battlefield execution of [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], and later murder of Henry VI extinguished the House of Lancaster. The House of York was victorious and by the mid-1470s looked safely established with seven living male princes, but it quickly brought about its own demise. [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence]], plotted against his brother and was executed. Following Edward's premature death in 1483, his brother Richard had Parliament declare his brother's two sons illegitimate on the pretext that Edward's marriage was invalid because of an alleged prior pre-contract to [[Lady Eleanor Talbot]].<ref name="titreg">{{harvnb|Neville Figgis|1896|p=373}}</ref> Richard seized the throne and the [[Princes in the Tower]] were never seen again. Richard's son predeceased him and he was killed at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, following an invasion of foreign mercenaries led by [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], who claimed the throne through his mother [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]]. He assumed the throne as Henry VII, founding the Tudor dynasty and bringing the Plantagenet line of kings to an end.<ref name=Weir2008>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=145}}</ref>

==Henry VII, the Tudors and the Plantagenet descendants==
[[File:Elizabeth of York from Kings and Queens of England.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Elizabeth of York]]]]
Henry VII of England was crowned and married Edward's heiress [[Elizabeth of York]] to legitimise his reign. Henry battled for more than a decade to prevail over Plantagenet plots by [[Margaret of York| Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy]].<ref name="tudors">{{harvnb|Hebditch|2003|p=6}}.</ref> 
She sent [[Lambert Simnel]] to Ireland, who purported to be her nephew Warwick. His army of Irish and Flemish supporters was defeated at the [[Battle of Stoke Field]] in 1487.<ref>
{{harvnb|Lawless|1893|pp=136, 138}}
</ref> 
The Duchess of Burgundy also claimed that [[Perkin Warbeck]] was Richard of Shrewsbury and twice supported invasions of England before Warbeck was captured and imprisoned in 1497. Warbeck's later escape attempt led to his execution and the execution of the last legitimate male line Plantagenet, [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick]], in 1499. 
When Henry Tudor seized the throne, there were numerous Plantagenet descendants who by later modern standards had a stronger right, including both his mother and future wife. 
By 1510 the number of claimants had increased by the birth of more than a dozen more Yorkists. Yorkists continued to be imprisoned or executed up to the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England]] with the Tudors ruthlessly extinguishing rival claims to the throne. Many legitimate and illegitimate lines of descent outside of politics remained unmolested and have survived to the present.<ref name=Weir2008>

|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Count of Anjou]]|| style="text-align:center;"|870<U+2013>1204||<small>ancestral family title, originating with [[Ingelger]]. Remained under direct control of the Plantagenets until [[Philip II of France]] captured the county and merged it with the [[House of Capet]] royal holdings.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Counts and Dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1110<U+2013>1203|| <small>ancestral family title, inherited by the House of Anjou after the marriage of [[Ermengarde of Maine]] with [[Fulk V of Anjou]]. It was captured and merged into the [[House of Capet]] royal holdings.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[King of Jerusalem]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1131<U+2013>1143||<small>title held by the grandfather of [[Henry II of England]] named [[Fulk of Jerusalem]]. Ruled for a while by their cousins. The Plantagenets followed up their claim in the [[Third Crusade|Third]] and [[Ninth Crusade]]s but never regained it.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Duke of Normandy]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1144<U+2013>1485|| <small>also used [[Count of Mortain]] title. Due to be handed to the Plantagenets during [[The Anarchy]] but Geoffrey V of Anjou conquered it early. Mainland holdings lost to Valois in 1259, but title continued to be used in relation to [[Channel Islands]]. Eventually lost to [[House of Tudor]].</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Duke of Aquitaine]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1152<U+2013>1422||<small>titles [[Duke of Gascony]] and [[Count of Poitiers]] also used. The Duchy became part of the Plantagenet holdings after [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] married Henry II. Eventually lost to [[House of Valois]].</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[King of England]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1154<U+2013>1485||<small>title became part of the Plantagenet holdings after the [[Treaty of Wallingford]]. The title was inherited through [[Empress Matilda|Matilda, Lady of the English]]. Eventually lost to the [[House of Tudor]].</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[List of Irish monarchs|Lord of Ireland]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1177<U+2013>1485||<small>title was a Plantagenet holding since 1177, replacing the [[High Kings of Ireland]] title. Eventually lost to the Tudors; [[Henry VIII of England]] later raised the Lordship to a Monarchal title.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Duke of Brittany]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1181<U+2013>1203||<small>title [[Count of Nantes]] also used. Became Plantagenet title after marriage of [[Constance, Duchess of Brittany]], and [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany]]. Strongly linked to [[Earl of Richmond]] title.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Cyprus|Lord of Cyprus]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1191<U+2013>1192||<small> title was briefly held by [[Richard the Lionheart]] after his conquest of the island, he then sold the island to [[Guy of Lusignan]] who raised Cyprus from a Lordship into the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]].</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[King of Sicily]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1254<U+2013>1263||<small>titular claim rather than de facto. [[Pope Alexander IV]] had declared Sicily a papal possession and offered the crown to Henry III's son [[Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster|Edmund, Earl of Lancaster]]. The next Pope reversed the offer and the Plantagenets never succeeded in taking the kingdom, but took the claim seriously.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[List of German monarchs|King of Germany]]<br>and<br>[[King of the Romans]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1257<U+2013>1272||<small>[[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]], was elected king in opposition to the claim of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], and after extensive lobbying and bribery. He was crowned in 1257 at Aachen as King of Germany. As such, he could claim the title of King of the Romans as emperor-elect. Since the pope supported Alfonso, he never crowned Richard as emperor. Richard only made four brief visits to Germany, and his sons were not considered as possible successors.</small>
|-
<U+2013>
| style="text-align:center;"|[[Prince of Wales]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1301<U+2013>1484|| <small>Originally a fief of the [[Angevin Empire]], it was given to the first-born son of the [[King of England]] after the [[Aberffraw Dynasty|Aberffraw dynasty]] rebelled against their vassal. Eventually lost to the Tudors.</small>
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[King of France]]|| style="text-align:center;"|1340<U+2013>1485|| <small>Mostly titular, rather than ''de facto''. The Plantagenets claimed to be the senior continuation of the [[House of Capet]] after the Direct Capetians line came to an end. During part of the Lancastrian period of rule there was a time when this was ''de facto'' rulership.</small>
