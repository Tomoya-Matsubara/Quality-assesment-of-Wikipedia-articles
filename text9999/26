'''St Peter's Church''' is the former [[parish church]] of [[Barton-upon-Humber]] in [[North Lincolnshire]], [[England]].  It is one of the best known [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon buildings]], in part due to its role in [[Thomas Rickman]]'s identification of the style.  It has been subject to major excavations, which are the most comprehensive for any parish church in Britain.  It is now run by [[English Heritage]] and houses an exhibition exploring its history.

==Origins==
The church lies immediately east of the remains of a near circular enclosure which contained a hall.  This is, on average, 820 feet in diameter and was originally surrounded by a ditch and timber [[palisade]] known to date to before 900.  An early pagan Saxon cemetery, believed to be linked with this enclosure and dated to the first half of the seventh century, was discovered at Castledyke, south of the church, and was used to bury high-status individuals.  In 669, [[Saint Chad]] founded a monastery in neighbouring [[Barrow-upon-Humber]].  An [[Anglo-Saxon charter]] dated 971 suggests that Barton became a [[grange]] attached to this monastery.<ref>Barrie Cox, "The pattern of Old English ''burh'' in early Lindsey", in ''Anglo-Saxon England: 23'', p.44</ref><ref name="williams">Ann Williams, "A bell-house and a burgh-geat", in Robert Liddiard, ''Anglo-Norman Castles'', pp.34-36</ref>

The earliest graves on the site of the church date from the ninth century, around one hundred years after the southerly cemetery was abandoned.  At this stage, it appears to have been reserved for burials associated with the hall and there may have been an associated chapel, although no trace of this remains.  This was Barton's first [[Christian]] cemetery.<ref name="drinkall">Gail Drinkall and Martin Foreman, ''The Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Castledyke South, Barton-on-Humber'', pp.16, 24, 363-364</ref>

The dating of the church is somewhat controversial.  [[English Heritage]] date the [[baptistery]] to the ninth century and the tower [[nave]] to the tenth century.<ref name="images">[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=165516&mode=adv Details for IoE Number: 165516], Images of England</ref>  Some other sources give a slightly later date, between 970 and 1030.<ref name="williams" />  In particular, it is uncertain whether the baptistery does predate the tower or if the two are contemporary.<ref name="jenkins">[[Simon Jenkins]], ''England's Thousand Best Churches'', p.367</ref>  Around the date of construction the ditch to the east was infilled, allowing level access between the hall and the church.<ref name="williams" />  Unusually, graves disturbed by the laying of foundations were carefully relocated.<ref name="hadley">Dawn M. Hadley and Jo Buckbery, ''Pastoral care in late Anglo-Saxon England'', in Francesca Tinti, ''Pastoral care in late Anglo-Saxon England'', p.132-134</ref>

==Architecture==
The church was originally [[Anglo-Saxon turriform churches|turriform]]: the ground floor of the tower served as the nave.<ref>Ernest Arthur Fisher, ''An Introduction to Anglo-Saxon Architecture and Sculpture'', London: Faber, 1959, OCLC 1279628, p. 57.</ref>

The tower shows typical features of [[Saxon]] architecture: walls of rendered [[rubble]], with decorative [[pilaster]] strip work, and long and short work.<ref name="images" /><ref name="oxford">Timothy Darvill et al, ''England: an Oxford archaeological guide to sites from earliest times to AD 1600'', p.135</ref>  The pilasters do not provide any possible support<U+2014>some are only very shallowly set into the wall.  They are cut from Roman [[ashlar]]s.<ref name="rodwell">[[Warwick Rodwell]], "Anglo Saxon Church Building: Aspects of Design and Construction", in ''The Archaeology of Anglo-Saxon England: Basic Readings'', pp.196-225</ref>  Oak beams survive at two levels in the tower; these would originally have supported higher floors.  The first floor must have been a gallery, as there are no windows at ground floor level.<ref name="rodwell" />  The tower has only a few, small, windows, with either round or triangular [[windowhead|head]]s, and they are divided by a shaft.<ref name="jenkins" />  There are north and south doorways, which appear to have originally possessed timber [[porch]]es.  The roof would have been of timber construction, probably of stepped pyramidal form, and covered with [[shingle]]s.<ref name="rodwell" />

The tower is linked to the baptistery by a narrow doorway, which originally had a timber doorcase.  Excavations have revealed a [[font]] base buried in the floor of the room.<ref name="rodwell" />  Externally, it is plainer than the tower, with even fewer, simple windows.<ref name="oxford" />  On the opposite side of the tower to the baptistery, a [[chancel]] was constructed.<ref name="images" />  Foundations of a permanent [[altar]] and a screen have been found under this space.<ref name="rodwell" />  Both baptistery and chancel would have had flat ceilings with [[attic]]s above.<ref name="rodwell" />

[[File:St Peters Barton-upon-Humber3.jpg|thumb|right|The mediaeval nave]]
Barton thrived as a town, and was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] housing two mills and a ferry, worth <U+00A3>4 per year.<ref name="williams" />  In the early [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] period, perhaps the late eleventh century, a third storey was added to the tower of St Peter's, using dressed [[limestone]]<ref name="oxford" /> in a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.

The chancel of St Peter's was demolished in the fourteenth century to make way for a much larger church, to the east of the existing tower.<ref name="jenkins" />  The earliest parts of this extension are in the [[Decorated Gothic]] style, with some of the arcade [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s reused from the earlier building.  One of these depicts a [[Green Man]].<ref name="jenkins" />   The east window retains contemporary [[stained glass]] depicting [[Saint George]] and [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]], while the [[clerestory]] dates from around 1430, as does a [[rood]] window at the east end of the north [[aisle]].  Other historic monuments include the fifteenth century chancel effigy and rood screen, and wall monuments from the late sixteenth century.<ref name="images" />

In about 1310, a [[cross]] was constructed in the churchyard.  This is [[Grade II listed]] in its own right,<ref>[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=165517&mode=adv Details for IoE Number: 165517], Images of England</ref> as is part of the churchyard wall.<ref>[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=165518&mode=adv Details for IoE Number: 165518], Images of England</ref>

==Early investigations==
[[Thomas Rickman]], a keen [[architectural historian]] and author of ''An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture'',<ref>"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23607?docPos=2 Rickman, Thomas]", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''</ref> investigated the church in 1819.<ref name="rodwell" />  His inspection led him to describe the principle of "structural stratification"<U+2014>where one phase of building rests on another, the second must be of an earlier date.  This enabled him, for the first time, to persuasively argue that a standing structure must be of Anglo-Saxon date, as the Norman top storey of the tower was supported by two stories constructed in a very different, then unknown, style.<ref>''Current archaeology, Issues 76-89'', p.209</ref>  Previously, while some work had been labelled as Saxon, this was all [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], and only guesswork attempted to distinguish this from [[Norman architecture]].  Rickman presented his influential hypothesis that St Peter's and [[St Thomas of Canterbury Church, Clapham]] possessed Saxon towers in an updated edition of ''An Attempt to Discriminate...''.<ref>[[Thomas Rickman]], ''An attempt to discriminate the styles of architecture in England'' (5th Edition), pp.55-56</ref>

==Excavation and restoration==
[[File:St Peter's Church, Barton-upon-Humber, SW view.jpg|thumb|right|View from the south east, showing the nave, south aisle, porch and tower]]
The church has been Grade A listed in 1965, a status since converted to [[Grade I listed|Grade I]].<ref name="images" />  It was closed in 1970, its former [[chapel-of-ease]], [[St Mary's Church, Barton-on-Humber|St Mary's]], becoming the parish church.  Ownership was taken over by the [[Department of the Environment]].<ref name="project">[http://www.stpetersbarton.org.uk/index.html St Peter's Church Project Barton-upon-Humber]</ref>

[[Harold McCarter Taylor]] identified the church as an ideal location for an archaeological excavation, given that it was, uniquely, a substantial Saxon church which was no longer used for worship.  He noted that, as the building had been examined repeatedly by architectural historians, there was little possibility of resolving the considerable questions about its construction and history without excavations.  In 1977, he secured funding from the Department of the Environment, and began the most extensive archaeological investigation ever undertaken of a British parish church,<ref name="rodwell" /> not completed until 1985.<ref name="project" />  3,000 skeletons were removed from the site, providing what has been described as "an [[osteological]] record unparalleled for any small town in England".<ref name="drinkall" />  Due to waterlogged conditions, in some cases, wooden coffins had also survived.  Some of these were dug-out logs, while some are believed to be constructed from old boats.  At least ten burials were accompanied by [[hazel]] rods, and one had a pillow of organic material.<ref name="hadley" />

Alongside the excavation, extensive repairs to the building were undertaken.<ref name="project" />  In 2007, the skeletons were placed in an on-site [[ossuary]], so as to leave them in consecrated ground close to their original location, while still permitting future study.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk//publications/conservation-bulletin-58/ Conservation Buletin 58], [[English Heritage]]</ref>  Three skeletons remain on display in the church, alongside a selection of [[grave goods]] and two coffins.  The church was opened by English Heritage as a visitor attraction in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.10974 Anglo Saxon church reveals its secrets], [[English Heritage]] {{deadlink|date=January 2011}}</ref>
