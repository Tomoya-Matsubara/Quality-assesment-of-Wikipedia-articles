'''The Magnificent Mile''', sometimes referred to as '''The Mag Mile''', is a prestigious section of [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]], running from the [[Chicago River]] to [[Oak Street (Chicago)|Oak Street]] in the [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]].<ref name=EoCMM>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/778.html|title=Magnificent Mile|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2007-05-16|author=Stamper, John W.}}</ref> The district is located adjacent to downtown, and one block east of [[Rush Street (Chicago)|Rush Street]], which is known for its [[nightlife]]. The Magnificent Mile serves as the main thoroughfare between Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|Loop business district]] and its [[Near North Side, Chicago#Gold Coast|Gold Coast]].<ref name=CNMAic>Stamper, John M., "Chicago's North Michigan Avenue", University of Chicago Press, 1991, inner cover, ISBN 0-226-77085-0</ref> It also serves as the western boundary of the [[Streeterville]] neighborhood.

[[Real estate developer]] Arthur Rubloff of [[Rubloff Company]] gave the nickname to one of the city's most prestigious residential and commercial thoroughfares in the 1940s.<ref name="EoCMM" /> Currently Chicago's largest shopping district, various mid-range and high-end shops line this section of the street and approximately {{convert|3100000|sqft|m2}} is currently occupied by retail stores, restaurants, museums and hotels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.world66.com/northamerica/unitedstates/illinois/chicago/7_day_itinerary |title=7 Days in Chicago &#124; Chicago 7 Day Itinerary |publisher=World66.com |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>  Several of the tallest buildings in the United States, such as the [[John Hancock Center]] and the [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], lie in the district. Numerous [[List of Chicago Landmarks|landmarks]] are located along the Magnificent Mile, such as the [[Wrigley Building]], [[Tribune Tower]], the [[Chicago Water Tower]] and the [[Allerton Hotel]].

==History==
[[File:20070509 Foot of Magnificent Mile.JPG|thumb|left|View north from the foot of the Magnificent Mile in the [[Michigan<U+2013>Wacker Historic District]]: the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] [[Wrigley Building]] (left) and [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] [[Tribune Tower]]]]
After the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871, [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] (anchored by [[Marshall Field's]]) in the downtown [[Chicago Loop|Loop]], especially the [[Loop Retail Historic District]], was the city's retailing center.<ref name=EoCSDaM>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1141.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2007-05-16|author=Bennett, Larry|title=Shopping Districts and Malls}}</ref>  The convenience of [[mass transit]] including [[streetcars]] and [[Chicago 'L'|elevated trains]], supported a retail corridor along State Street from [[Lake Street, Chicago|Lake Street]] to Van Buren Street.<ref name="EoCSDaM" />  By the 1920s, commuter suburbs began to have significant retail districts.<ref name="EoCSDaM" />  Prior to the [[bascule bridge]] construction, [[swing bridges]] across the river were open for ship traffic during half the daylight hours.<ref name=EoCI>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/641.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2007-05-17|author=Cain, Louis P.|title=Infrastructure}}</ref>  The [[Rush Street Bridge]] was the swing bridge for this area.<ref name=CNMA4>Stamper, John M., "Chicago's North Michigan Avenue", University of Chicago Press, 1991, pg. 4, ISBN 0-226-77085-0</ref>  The opening of the Michigan Avenue Bridge in 1920 created a new commercial district.<ref name="EoCSDaM" />  After 1950, suburban development reduced the role of the Loop's daily significance to many Chicagoans as downtown retail sales slipped. However, the Magnificent Mile kept a luxury shopping district close to the central business district.<ref name=EoCtL>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/764.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2007-05-17|author=Danzer, Gerald A.|title=The Loop}}</ref>

The concept for the Magnificent Mile was actually part of [[Daniel Burnham]]'s [[Plan of Chicago]].<ref name="EoCMM" />  It was constructed during the 1920s to replace Pine Street, which had formerly been lined with [[factories|factory]] and [[warehouse]]s near the river and fine [[mansion]] and [[rowhouse]] residences farther north.<ref name="EoCMM" /> The earliest building constructions varied in style, but challenged new heights in construction.<ref name="EoCMM" /> The name the "Magnificent Mile" is a [[registered trademark]] of the Greater North Michigan Avenue Association (GNMAA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoyillinois.com/home.aspx|title=The Official Web Site of the Illinois Bureau of Tourism|accessdate=2009-05-22|publisher=Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity}}</ref>

After the [[Great Depression]] and World War II, Arthur Rubloff and [[William Zeckendorf]] bought or controlled most of the property along this stretch of the avenue and supported a plan by [[Holabird & Roche|Holabird & Root]] to construct new buildings and renovation of old ones that took advantage of new [[zoning]] laws.<ref name="EoCMM" />  Soon the property values driven by the luxury shopping districts were pricing out the nearby artists of Towertown, just south west of the [[Chicago Water Tower]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1265.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2007-05-16|author=Seligman, Amanda|title=Towertown}}</ref>  Having acquired most of the rights to property along the Magnificent Mile at Depression-level prices, Rubloff and Zeckendorf successfully developed and promoted the area until it became one of the most prestigious addresses of the city.  That distinction continues to hold today,<ref name="EoCMM" /> and spurred the continuing erection of more high-rise apartments and new investment along the Magnificent Mile and throughout the Near North Side.<ref name=EoCNNS>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/876.html|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2007-05-17|author=Seligman, Amanda|title=Near North Side}}</ref>

The opening of the 74-story [[Water Tower Place]] in 1975 marked the return of Chicago to retailing prominence.<ref name="EoCSDaM" />  By 1979, the State Street commercial corridor had lost its commercial vitality and was closed to street traffic for renovation including sidewalk widening until 1996.<ref name="EoCSDaM" />

==Today==

===Seasonal events===
[[File:20070513 Magnificent Mile Garden Planter.JPG|thumb|left|Magnificent Mile garden planter (with visible median planter)]]
With each season, the ambiance of The Magnificent Mile changes.

He brings along a lot of friends, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, other Disney friends, marching bands, celebrities and more! It is considered the first annual Holiday procession of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=resources&id=5749370|title=The 2007 Magnificent Mile Lights Festival: ABC 7 Chicago kicks off the holiday season nationwide with live broadcast of the festival|accessdate=2009-05-22|date=2007-11-08|publisher=abc7chicago.com home}}</ref>

===Transportation & Infrastructure===
North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane [[two-way street]] that is serviced by [[Chicago Transit Authority]] public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect the area to the entire [[Chicago metropolitan area]].  It is also serviced by seasonal [[Tram|trolley]] service along the street, and the foot of the Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]], the [[Chicago 'L']] rapid transit services the street via its [[Red Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Red Line]].  Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.<ref name=CNMASOo1GSiA>{{cite press release|url=http://www.themagnificentmile.com/PressReleases/APA_Award_Winner.pdf|title=Chicago's North Michigan Avenue Selected One of 10 Great Street in America: A Seven-Block Urban Wonderland|accessdate=2009-05-22|publisher=American Planning Association|date=2007-10-02|author=Buscemi, Connie, John Maxson, and Denny Johnson}}</ref>

In autumn 2011, North Michigan Ave. was completely repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable [[stone-matrix asphalt]] pavement mix that incorporated high levels of recycled materials, including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and asphalt millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills.<ref>{{Citation | last = Williams | first = Cindy | last2 = Garrott | first2 = Fred | title = Recycling/reclaiming: A savings spree | newspaper = Roads & Bridges | year = 2012 | date = 2012-02-06 | url = http://www.roadsbridges.com/recyclingreclaiming-savings-spree | accessdate = 2012-07-30}}</ref> The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street. In July 2012, the City of Chicago and CDOT were honored with the Environmental Leadership Award from the National Asphalt Pavement Association.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/news/2012/jul/cdot_recognized_forenvironmentalleadershipforinnovativeuseofrecy.html|title=CDOT Recognized for Environmental Leadership for Innovative Use of Recycled Materials in Michigan Avenue Repaving Project|accessdate=2012-07-30|publisher=Chicago Department of Transportation|date=2012-07-17}}</ref>
