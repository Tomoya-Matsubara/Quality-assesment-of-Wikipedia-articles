'''Boles<U+0142>aw Prus''' (pronounced: [[Image:Ltspkr.png]] [[Media:Prus.ogg|<nowiki>[b&#596;'l<U+03B5>swaf 'prus]</nowiki>]]; [[August 20]], [[1847]] &ndash; [[May 19]], [[1912]]), whose actual name was  '''Aleksander G<U+0142>owacki''', was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[journalist]], [[short story|short-story writer]] and [[novelist]].  The leading representative of [[Literary realism|realism]] in 19th-century [[Polish literature]], G<U+0142>owacki took the [[pen name]] "Prus" from the name of his family [[Prus coat of arms|coat-of-arms]].

An indelible mark was left on Prus by his experiences as a 15-year-old soldier in the Polish [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]], in which he suffered severe injuries and imprisonment.

In 1872, at age 25, Prus settled into a distinguished 40-year journalistic career.  In the spirit of the [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]], anti-[[Polish Romanticism|Romantic]] philosophy prevalent in post-1863-Uprising Poland, he helped prepare his compatriots to compete in a world increasingly dominated by science and technology. 

As a sideline, to broaden the appeal of his ideas, Prus began writing short stories.  Achieving success with these, he went on to employ a broader canvas. Between 1886 and 1895, he completed four major [[novel]]s on great societal questions of the day. Perennial favorites with his countrymen are ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''. 

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Aleksander G<U+0142>owacki was born on [[August 20]], [[1847]], in [[Hrubiesz<U+00F3>w]], [[Poland]], the younger son of Antoni G<U+0142>owacki, an estate steward in the village of <U+017B>abcze, in [[Hrubiesz<U+00F3>w County]], and Apolonia G<U+0142>owacka, ''[[n<U+00E9>e]]'' Trembi<U+0144>ska. In 1850, when the future ''Boles<U+0142>aw Prus'' was three years old, his mother died; the child was given into the care of his maternal grandmother, Marcjanna Trembi<U+0144>ska of [[Pu<U+0142>awy]], and, four years later, of his aunt, Domicela Olszewska of [[Lublin]]. In 1856 Prus was [[orphan]]ed by his father's death. In 1862 his brother Leon, a teacher who was thirteen years older than Prus, took him to [[Siedlce]], then to [[Kielce]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=146<U+2013>47 }}</ref>
[[Image:Lublin Castle 5 Lublin 28.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Lublin Castle]], where 16-year-old Prus was imprisoned after his capture during the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]]]]
Soon after the Polish [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against [[Imperial Russia]] began, 15-year-old Prus ran away from school to join the insurgents, perhaps influenced by Leon, who subsequently became one of the insurrection's leaders. During the Uprising, Leon developed a mental illness that he would suffer from until his death in 1907. On [[September 1]], [[1863]], twelve days after his sixteenth birthday, Prus himself took part in a battle against [[Russia]]n forces at the village of Bia<U+0142>ka, four kilometers south of [[Siedlce]]; he suffered [[contusion]]s to the neck and [[gunpowder]] injuries to his eyes, and was captured unconscious on the battlefield and taken to hospital in Siedlce.<ref>

Eventually released on account of his youth, in 1866 he completed [[secondary school]] and enrolled in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the [[University of Warsaw]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=147 }}</ref>

His studies were cut short in 1868 due to financial difficulties. In 1869 he enrolled at the Agricultural and Forestry Institute in [[Pu<U+0142>awy]], a town in which he had spent part of his childhood; he was, however, soon expelled after a classroom confrontation with a Russian professor.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=147 }}</ref> Henceforth he studied on his own while supporting himself as a tutor, a factory worker, and, from 1872, as a journalist.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=148 }}</ref> Journalism would become his school of writing. 

In 1873 Prus delivered two public lectures whose subjects illustrate the breadth of his scientific interests: "On the Structure of the Universe," and "On Discoveries and Inventions."<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=148 }}</ref>

=== Journalism ===

As a newspaper columnist, Prus commented on the achievements of scientists and scholars such as [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Alexander Bain]], [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Henry Thomas Buckle]];<ref>{{cite book |title=''Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa'' (The Art of Boles<U+0142>aw Prus) |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year=1947 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=18-23, 31-32, 293-94 and ''[[passim]]''}}</ref> urged Poles to study science and technology and to develop industry and commerce; encouraged the establishment of [[charitable organization|charitable institutions]] to benefit the underprivileged; described the fiction and nonfiction works of fellow [[writer]]s such as [[H.G. Wells]];{{Ref_label|a|a|none}} and extolled man-made and natural wonders such as the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kasparek |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Kasparek |coauthors= |year=1997 |month= |title=Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and the Wieliczka Salt Mine |journal=[[The Polish Review]] |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=349-55 |id= |url= |accessdate= 2008-02-11 }}</ref> the town of [[Na<U+0142><U+0119>cz<U+00F3>w]], and an 1887 [[solar eclipse]] that he witnessed at [[M<U+0142>awa]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kasparek |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Kasparek |coauthors= |year=1997 |month= |title=Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and the Solar Eclipse  |journal=[[The Polish Review]] |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=471-78 |id= |url= |accessdate= 2008-02-11 }}</ref> 

His "Weekly Chronicles" spanned forty years (they have since been reprinted in twenty volumes), and would help prepare the ground for the [[20th-century]] blossoming of Polish [[Timeline of Polish science and technology|science]] and especially Polish [[Polish School of Mathematics|mathematics]].{{Ref_label|b|b|none}} "Our national life," wrote Prus, "will take a normal course only when we have become a useful, indispensable element of civilization, when we have become able to give nothing for free and to demand nothing for free."<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=49 }}</ref> The social importance of science and technology would recur as a theme in his novels ''[[The Doll]]'' (1889) and ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895).
  
Of contemporary thinkers, the one who most greatly influenced Prus and other writers of the Polish "[[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]]" period (roughly 1864<U+2013>1900) was [[Herbert Spencer]], the [[England|English]] [[sociologist]] who coined the phrase, "[[survival of the fittest]]." Prus would call Spencer "the [[Aristotle]] of the 19th century" and would write: "I grew up under the influence of Spencerian [[evolution]]ary [[philosophy]] and heeded its counsels, not those of [[Idealist]] or [[August Comte|Comtean]] [[philosophy]]."<ref>{{cite book |title=Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa (The Art of Boles<U+0142>aw Prus) |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year=1947 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=21-22 }}</ref> Prus interpreted "survival of the fittest," in the societal sphere, as involving not only competition but also cooperation; and he adopted Spencer's metaphor of society as organism.<ref>{{cite book |title=''Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa'' (The Art of Boles<U+0142>aw Prus) |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year=1947 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=32-33}}</ref>  He would use this metaphor to striking effect in his 1884 [[flash fiction|micro-story]] "[[Mold of the Earth]]," and in the introduction to his 1895 [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]''.

After Prus began writing regular weekly newspaper columns, his finances stabilized, permitting him on [[January 14]], [[1875]], to marry a [[List of coupled cousins|distant cousin]] on his mother's side, Oktawia Trembi<U+0144>ska.<ref>After Prus' death in 1912, she would survive him until her own death on [[October 25]], [[1936]].

Though Prus was a gifted writer, initially best known for his humorist work, early on he thought little of his journalistic and literary productions. Hence at the inception of his career in 1872, at age 25, he adopted for his newspaper columns and fiction the [[pen name]] "Prus"<U+2014>"''[[Prus Coat of Arms|Prus I]]''" being his family [[coat-of-arms]]<U+2014>while reserving his actual name, Aleksander G<U+0142>owacki, for "serious" writings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=148 }}</ref>

In 1878 an incident occurred that illustrated the strong feelings that could be aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. In one of his columns, Prus had criticized the loud and, in his view, inappropriate behavior of some youths at a lecture about the poet [[Wincenty Pol]]. The [[University of Warsaw]] students in question demanded that Prus retract what he had written. After he refused, on [[March 26]], [[1878]], several of them surrounded him outside his home, to which he had just returned in the company of two fellow-writers, and one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus in the face.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus, 1847-1912: Kalendarz <U+017C>ycia i tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B>ci |last=Tokarz<U+00F3>wna |first=Krystyna |authorlink= |coauthors=Stanis<U+0142>aw Fita |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=187<U+2013>90}}</ref> Prus summoned police, but subsequently declined to press charges against the students.<ref>Lorentowicz, Jan, in the book, ''Wspomnienia  o Boles<U+0142>awie Prusie'', 106.</ref> He remembered the incident, however; and seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to [[Paris]], he refused, by some accounts, to meet with one of his erstwhile assailants, whom he blamed for having "ruined [his] life," perhaps by having caused or exacerbated his [[agoraphobia]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus, 1847-1912: Kalendarz <U+017C>ycia i tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B>ci |last=Tokarz<U+00F3>wna |first=Krystyna |authorlink= |coauthors=Stanis<U+0142>aw Fita |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=474}}</ref> 

In 1882 Prus assumed the editorship of a [[Warsaw]] daily, ''Nowiny'' (News), resolving in the best [[Positivism in Poland|Positivist]] fashion to make it "an observatory of societal facts"<U+2014>an instrument for advancing the development of his country. After less than a year, however, ''Nowiny'' folded and Prus resumed writing [[column (newspaper)|columns]].<ref>Pie<U+015B>cikowski, Edward, ''Boles<U+0142>aw Prus'', 152.</ref>  He continued working as a journalist to the very end of his life, even well after he had achieved success as an author of short stories and novels.

=== Novels and stories ===
[[Image:Prus portrait 1897.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait by Antoni Kamie<U+0144>ski celebrating Prus' 25 years, to 1897, as journalist and literary artist]]
In time, Prus adopted the French Positivist critic [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s concept of the arts, including literature, as a second means, alongside the sciences, of studying reality,<ref>{{cite book |title=Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=109 }}</ref> and he devoted more attention to his sideline of [[short story|short-story writer]]. Prus's stories, which met with great acclaim, owed much to the Polish novelist [[J<U+00F3>zef Ignacy Kraszewski]] and, among foreign writers, to [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Mark Twain]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The History of Polish Literature  |last=Mi<U+0142>osz |first=Czes<U+0142>aw |authorlink=Czes<U+0142>aw Mi<U+0142>osz |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=293 }}</ref> His fiction would also be influenced by [[Victor Hugo]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Alphonse Daudet]] and [[<U+00C9>mile Zola]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=66, 84, 122 and ''[[passim]]'' }}</ref>

Prus wrote a couple dozen stories, ranging in length from [[flash fiction|micro-story]] to [[novella]].  His better-known stories include "The Returning Wave" ("Powracaj<U+0105>ca fala", 1880), "Micha<U+0142>ko" (1880), "Antek" (1880), "The Barrel Organ" ("Katarynka", 1880), "The Waistcoat" ("Kamizelka", 1882), "Him" ("On", 1882), "Fading Voices" ("Milkn<U+0105>ce g<U+0142>osy", 1883), "Sins of Childhood" ("Grzechy dzieci<U+0144>stwa", 1883), "The Mistake" ("Omy<U+0142>ka", 1884), "[[Mold of the Earth]]" ("Ple<U+015B><U+0144> <U+015B>wiata", 1884), "[[wikisource:The Living Telegraph|The Living Telegraph]]" ("<U+017B>ywy telegraf", 1884), "[[Shades (story)|Shades]]" ("Ciene", 1885), "Anielka" (1885), "[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]" ("Z legend dawnego Egiptu", 1888) and "The Dream" ("Sen", 1890). 

Eventually Prus would compose four major [[novel]]s on great questions of the day: ''[[The Outpost (novel)|The Outpost]]'' (1886) on the Polish peasant; ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1889) on the [[aristocracy]] and [[townspeople]] and on [[Ideal (ethics)|idealists]] struggling to bring about [[social reform]]s; ''[[The New Woman (novel)|The New Woman]]'' (1893) on [[feminism|feminist]] concerns; and his only [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (1895), on mechanisms of [[political power]].

After having sold ''Pharaoh'' to the publishing firm of Gebethner and Wolff, Prus embarked on [[May 16]], [[1895]], on a four-month journey abroad. He visited [[Berlin]], [[Dresden]], [[Karlsbad]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]] and [[Rapperswil]]. At the latter [[Switzerland|Swiss]] town he stayed two months (July<U+2013>August), nursing his [[agoraphobia]] and spending much time with his friends, the promising young writer [[Stefan <U+017B>eromski]] and his wife Oktawia. The couple sought Prus's help for the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil|Polish National Museum]] where <U+017B>eromski was librarian.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=157 }}</ref>

The final stage of Prus's journey took him to [[Paris]], where he was prevented by his agoraphobia from crossing the [[Seine River]] to visit the city's southern [[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=157 }}</ref> He was nevertheless pleased to find that his descriptions of Paris in ''The Doll'' had been on the mark (he had based them mainly on French-language publications).<ref>Oral account by Prus' widow, Oktawia G<U+0142>owacka, cited by Tadeusz Hi<U+017C>, "''Godzina u pani Oktawii''" ("An Hour at Oktawia G<U+0142>owacka's"), in the book, ''Wspomnienia o Boles<U+0142>awie Prusie'', 278.</ref> From Paris he hurried home to recuperate at [[Na<U+0142><U+0119>cz<U+00F3>w]] from his journey, the last that he would make abroad.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=157-58 }}</ref>

=== Later years ===
Over the years, Prus lent his name and support to many charitable and social causes. There was one such event that he would come to regret, for the broad criticism that it brought him:  it involved helping to welcome [[Russia]]'s [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II]] during an 1897 visit to Warsaw.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus  |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=159-60 }}</ref>

Prus's experiences in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] had persuaded him to urge  society's advancement through work, learning and commerce rather than through potentially disastrous social upheavals. He departed from this stance, however, in 1905, when [[Tsarist Russia]] experienced defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and his compatriots demanded autonomy and reforms. On [[December 20]], [[1905]], in the first issue of a short-lived new periodical, ''M<U+0142>odo<U+015B><U+0107>'' (''Youth''), he published an article, "Oda do m<U+0142>odo<U+015B>ci" ("Ode to Youth"), whose title harked back to, and was an updated paraphrase of, the 1820 poem by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. In it Prus wrote, in reference to his earlier position on revolution and strikes: "... with the greatest pleasure I admit it<U+2014>I was wrong!"<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus, 1847-1912: Kalendarz <U+017C>ycia i tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B>ci |last=Tokarz<U+00F3>wna |first=Krystyna |authorlink= |coauthors=Stanis<U+0142>aw Fita |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=626 }}
</ref>

In 1908, Prus published his novel, ''Children'' (''Dzieci'') in the Warsaw ''Illustrated Weekly'' (''Tygodnik Ilustrowany''). It describing the young revolutionaries, terrorists and anarchists of the period. Three years later a final novel, ''Changes'' (''Przemiany''), was to have been a panorama of the society and of its vital concerns, not unlike ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]''. The beginning, however, had barely been serialized in the ''Illustrated Weekly'' in 1911-12 when the novel's composition was cut short by Prus's death.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus  |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=142-43, 165-67 }} </ref> Neither of the two late novels is generally regarded as part of the essential Prus canon.

Prus's last novel to meet with popular acclaim was ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', completed in 1895.

Half a century after Prus' death, on [[December 3]], [[1961]], a museum devoted to him was opened in the 18th-century Ma<U+0142>achowski Palace at [[Na<U+0142><U+0119>cz<U+00F3>w]], near [[Lublin]]. It was at Na<U+0142><U+0119>cz<U+00F3>w that Prus had vacationed for thirty years from 1882 until his death, and that he had met the young [[Stefan <U+017B>eromski]]. Prus had served as witness at <U+017B>eromski's 1892 wedding and had helped foster the younger man's writing career.

While Prus espoused a [[positivist]] and [[Literary realism|realist]] outlook, much in his fiction shows qualities compatible with pre-[[January Uprising|1863-Uprising]] Polish [[Romantic literature]]; indeed, he held the Polish [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in high regard.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=111-12 }}</ref> Prus's novels in turn, especially ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' and ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', with their innovative composition techniques, blazed the way for the [[20th-century]] Polish novel.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=10-14}}</ref>

''The Doll'' and ''Pharaoh'', which made Prus a potential candidate for the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], are available in English versions.<ref>Boles<U+0142>aw Prus, ''The Doll'', translation by David Welsh, revised by Dariusz To<U+0142>czyk and Anna Zaranko, 1996; ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', translated from the Polish by [[Christopher Kasparek]], 2nd ed., 2001.</ref> ''The Doll'' has been translated into sixteen languages, and ''Pharaoh'' into twenty.

In 1897-99 Prus [[Serial (literature)|serialized]] in the Warsaw ''Daily Courier'' (''Kurier Codzienny'') a monograph on ''[[Wikisource:The Most General Life Ideals|The Most General Life Ideals]]'' (''Najog<U+00F3>lniejsze idea<U+0142>y <U+017C>yciowe''), which systematized ethical ideas that he had developed over his career regarding ''happiness'', ''utility'' and ''perfection'' in the lives of individuals and societies.<ref>{{cite book |title=''Tw<U+00F3>rczo<U+015B><U+0107> Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa'' (The Art of Boles<U+0142>aw Prus) |last=Szweykowski |first=Zygmunt |authorlink=Zygmunt Szweykowski |coauthors= |year=1947 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=295-97 and ''[[passim]]''}}
</ref> In it he returned to the society-organizing (i.e., political) interests that had been frustrated during his ''Nowiny'' editorship fifteen years earlier. A book edition appeared in 1901 (2nd, revised edition, 1905). This work, rooted in [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] and [[Herbert Spencer#General|Herbert Spencer's]] view of society-as-organism, retains interest especially for [[philosophy|philosophers]] and [[social science|social scientists]].

Another of Prus's learned projects remained incomplete at his death. He had sought over his writing career to develop a coherent theory of literary composition.  Notes of his from 1886-1912 were never put together into a finished book as he had intended.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pogl<U+0105>dy estetyczne i dzia<U+0142>alno<U+015B><U+0107> krytycznoliteracka Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa |last=Melkowski |first=Stefan |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=84-146 }}</ref>  Some particularly intriguing fragments describe Prus's [[combinatorial]] [[calculation]]s of the millions of potential "individual types" of human [[character structure|characters]], given a stated number of "individual [[Trait theory|traits]]."

A curious [[comparative literature|comparative-literature]] aspect has been noted to Prus's career, which paralleled that of his [[United States|American]] contemporary, [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1842-1914). Each became a [[war]] [[Casualty (person)|casualty]] with [[combat]] [[head trauma]]<U+2014>Prus in 1863 in the Polish [[January Uprising|1863-65 Uprising]]; Bierce in 1864 in the [[American Civil War]]. Each experienced false starts in other occupations, and at twenty-five became a journalist for the next forty years; failed to sustain a career as editor-in-chief; achieved celebrity as a short-story writer; lost a son in tragic circumstances (Prus, an adopted son; Bierce, both his sons); attained superb humorous effects by portraying human egoism (Prus especially in ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'', Bierce in ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]''); was dogged from early adulthood by a health problem (Prus, [[agoraphobia]]; Bierce, [[asthma]]); and died within two years of the other (Prus in 1912; Bierce presumably in 1914). Prus, however, unlike Bierce, went on from short stories to write novels.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kasparek |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Kasparek |coauthors= |year=1995 |month= |title=Two [[Flash fiction|Micro-stories]] by Boles<U+0142>aw Prus |journal=[[The Polish Review]] |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=99-103 |id= |url= |accessdate= 2008-02-12}}</ref>

In Prus's lifetime and since, his contributions to Polish literature and culture have been memorialized, regardless of the nature of the country's political system at the time:
*His 50th birthday, in 1897, was marked by special newspaper issues celebrating his 25 years as a journalist and literary artist, and a portrait of him was commissioned from artist Antoni Kamie<U+0144>ski.<ref>Pie<U+015B>cikowski, Edward, ''Boles<U+0142>aw Prus'', 94-95, 159 and ''passim''.</ref>
*The town where Prus was born, [[Hrubiesz<U+00F3>w]], near the present Polish-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] border, is graced by an outdoor sculpture of him.
*A 1982 plaque on [[Warsaw University]]'s administration building, the historic [[Kazimierz Palace]], commemorates Prus' years at the University in 1866-68.
*Across the street (''[[Krakowskie Przedmie<U+015B>cie]]'') from the University, in the [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]], a 1936 plaque by Prus' nephew [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Jackowski]], featuring Prus' profile, is dedicated to the memory of the "great writer and teacher of the nation."<ref>Kotarbi<U+0144>ski, Mi<U+0142>osz, ''"Kilka lu<U+017A>nych wspomnie<U+0144> o Boles<U+0142>awie Prusie"'' ("Several Loose Reminiscences about Boles<U+0142>aw Prus"), in Stanis<U+0142>aw Fita, ed., ''Wspomnienia o Boles<U+0142>awie Prusie'', 147-48, 151.</ref>
*At [[Na<U+0142><U+0119>cz<U+00F3>w]], Prus's favorite vacationing place, is a Prus Museum, opened in 1961, and outside it, a statue of Prus.
*On the front of Warsaw's present-day ''ulica Wilcza 12'', the site of Prus' last home, is a plaque commemorating the earlier, now-nonexistent building's most famous resident.
*A few hundred meters from there, ''ulica Boles<U+0142>awa Prusa'' (Boles<U+0142>aw Prus Street) debouches into the southeast corner of Warsaw's [[Triple Cross Square]].  In this square  stands [[St. Alexander's Church]], where Prus's funeral was held.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus  |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=136<U+2013>37}}</ref>
*In 1937, plaques were installed at ''[[Krakowskie Przedmie<U+015B>cie]]'' ''4'' and ''7'', where the two chief characters of Prus's novel ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'', Stanis<U+0142>aw Wokulski and Ignacy Rzecki, respectively, were deduced to have resided.<ref>Pie<U+015B>cikowski, Edward, ''Boles<U+0142>aw Prus'', 68-69.</ref>
*From 1975 to 1984, Prus's compatriots honored his memory with a 10-''[[z<U+0142>oty]]'' coin featuring his profile.
*Near the site of a newspaper for which Prus once wrote, in a park on Warsaw's ''[[Krakowskie Przedmie<U+015B>cie]]'' adjacent to the [[Hotel Bristol]], stands a statue of Prus, sculpted in the late 1970s by Anna Kami<U+0144>ska-<U+0141>api<U+0144>ska.<ref>{{cite book |title=Boles<U+0142>aw Prus  |last=Pie<U+015B>cikowski |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |pages=144-45}} </ref>  It is some twelve feet tall, on a minimal pedestal as befits an author who always chose to be close to his fellow man.
*Consonant with Prus's interest in the advancement of commerce and technology, there is a Polish Ocean Lines [[freighter]] named for him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pol.com.pl/?sub=3&sub2=b&statek=110

'''a.''' {{Note_label|a|a|none}} In a January 1909 newspaper column, Prus discussed [[H.G. Wells]]' 1901 book, ''Anticipations'', including Wells' prediction that by the year 2000, following the defeat of [[Germany|German]] [[imperialism]] "on land and at sea," there would be a [[European Union]] that would reach eastward to include the [[western Slavs]]<U+2014>the [[Poland|Poles]], [[Czech Republic|Czechs]] and [[Slovakia|Slovaks]].
