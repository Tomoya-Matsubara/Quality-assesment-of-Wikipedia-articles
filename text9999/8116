"'''This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like'''" is the debut single of [[United States|American]] [[Pop rock|pop-rock]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Porcelain Black]], featuring American [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Lil Wayne]]. This song serves as the [[lead single]] from the singer's debut studio album, ''[[Mannequin Factory]]''. Produced by [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[record producer|producer]] [[RedOne]], who had originally discovered Black, "This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like" draws influences from the genre of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Lyrics|lyrically]] stating how the listener should be proud of who they are. The song was released digitally in the United States on March 29, 2011, and managed to chart at number forty-four on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]].

A [[music video]] for "This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like", shot and directed by Sanaa Hamri, was released on March 27, 2011. The music video pays homage to Porcelain Black's high school experiences, where she was constantly teased by "snobby rich kids", but never gave in to the pressure of her peers around her. The video serves as a form of revenge for Porcelain Black against high school tormentors. "This Is What Rock n' Roll Looks Like" garnered mixed reviews from critics, most of whom were shocked by Porcelain Black's image and sounds but favored her apparent perception of herself as the "offspring" of fellow musicians [[Britney Spears]] and [[Marilyn Manson]] and their individual styles. Porcelain Black performed the song on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', marking her debut televised appearance.

<blockquote>
"I'm a pretty good representation of rock and roll, as far as I<U+2019>m concerned. I'm ... crazy. Some people might have their own opinions and say well this is kind of pop-y. I think we're in a world now where music is evolving and it doesn't have to be just one thing. It doesn't have to be just pop or just rock. You can mix it and have it still be legitimate rock 'n' roll. I like to say if Marilyn Manson and Britney Spears ... had a kid it would be me."<ref name="latimes1">{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Gerrick D.|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/04/porcelain-black-knows-shes-rock-n-roll-doesnt-care-who-says-or-thinks-otherwise.html |title=Porcelain Black knows she's rock and roll, and doesn<U+2019>t care who says otherwise |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=April 28, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref>

<blockquote>
"Whatever you want it to look like. There are so many types of rock 'n' roll, you can't say one thing, this is what rock 'n' roll looks like. Rock 'n' roll I think is about attitude and the way you carry yourself, and that's what it looks like. It's not necessarily what you're wearing."<ref name=gayles/>

In an interview with [[AOL Music]]'s Contessa Gayles, Porcelain Black discussed the concept of the video as revenge.<ref name=gayles/> She stated:

<blockquote>
It was about getting revenge. People were always hating on me, because I was different. I was like, "I'm going to sing, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that," they were like "OK, sure you are." And I was like "No, I'm serious. This is what I'm going to do." And everybody was like, "Yeah right." Even when I told everyone I was moving to LA to do music and had a going away party, only one person showed up, because no one believed that I was really going away. They were like, "You'll be back." So it was kind of just like my revenge, and just a statement, like throwing it back in their face.<ref name=gayles/>
