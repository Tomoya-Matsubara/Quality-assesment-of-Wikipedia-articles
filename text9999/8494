'''Flat Holm''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Ynys Echni'') is a limestone [[island]] lying in the [[Bristol Channel]] approximately {{convert|6|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} from [[Lavernock Point]] in [[Glamorgan]]. It includes the most southerly point of [[Wales]].

The island has a long history of occupation, dating at least from [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Viking]] periods. Religious uses include visits by  disciples of [[Saint Cadoc]] in the 6th century, and in 1835 it was the site of the foundation of the Bristol Channel Mission, which later became the [[Mission to Seafarers]]. A [[sanatorium]] for [[cholera]] patients was built in 1896 as the isolation hospital for the port of [[Cardiff]]. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] transmitted the first [[wireless]] signals over open sea from Flat Holm to [[Lavernock]]. Because of frequent shipwrecks a [[lighthouse]] was built on the island, which was replaced by a [[Trinity House]] lighthouse in 1737. Because of its strategic position on the approaches to [[Bristol]] and Cardiff a series of gun emplacements, known as Flat Holm Battery, were built in the 1860s as part of a [[Palmerston Forts, Bristol Channel|line of defences]], known as [[Palmerston Forts]]. On the outbreak of [[World War II]], the island was rearmed. 

It is now managed by [[Cardiff Council|Cardiff Council's]] Flat Holm Project Team and designated as a [[Local Nature Reserve]], [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and a [[Special Protection Area]], because of the maritime grassland and rare plants such as [[Limonium binervosum|Rock Sea-Lavender]] (''Limonium binervosum'') and [[Wild Leek]] (''Allium ampeloprasum''). The island also has significant breeding colonies of [[Lesser Black-backed Gull]] (''Larus fuscus''),  [[Herring Gull]] (''Larus argentatus'') and [[Great Black-backed Gull]] (''Larus marinus''). It is also home to [[Slow worm]]s (''Anguis fragilis'') with larger than usual blue markings.

==History==
The first traces of human habitation of the island are from the late [[Bronze Age]], 900 to 700 BC, known as the [[Ewart Park Phase]]. A [[bronze]] axe head was discovered on the island in 1988, between the island's modern lone farmhouse and West Beach, at {{gbmapping|ST21986498}}.<ref name="CC Guide">{{Citation | title = Flat Holm Island | publisher = Cardiff Council | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-902466-14-3 }}</ref> In the [[Sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman]] period of the 6th century AD, it became a retreat for [[Gildas|Saint Gildas]], who lived on the island as a hermit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=John|title=Delineations of the north western division of the county of Somerset.|publisher=G.

In June 1815, a Dr. Thomas Turner visited Flat Holm in a small boat and was stranded for a week due to high winds. He discovered two [[Christian]] graves located close together in a field {{convert|23|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} northeast of the island's present farmhouse; one grave had been opened and contained a male skeleton inside.<ref name="Turner">{{Citation | title = Memoirs of Thomas Turner Esq. | place =  | publisher = Printed in Manchester  | year = 1875 | volume = pp. 21&ndash;22}}</ref> The open grave's headstone was made of [[Purbeck Marble|purbeck marble]] and engraved with a [[Celtic cross]], but had since broken in two.<ref>{{Citation | first = F.

[[Anglo-Saxons]] called the island ''Bradanreolice''. ''Reolice'' derives from an Irish word meaning churchyard or graveyard, alluding to the belief that the island had some type of religious meaning to people at the time.<ref name="CC Guide"/> However, the island's current name of "Holm" comes from the [[Old Norse]] meaning "island in an estuary".<ref name="contland">{{cite web|url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=434|title=Contaminated land inspection strategy|publisher=The County Council of the City & County of Cardiff|date=October 2002|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> Records indicate that a [[Viking]] fleet from the south of [[Brittany]] led by two earls, Other and Hroald, took refuge on the island following their defeat by the [[Saxons]] at [[Watchet]].<ref name="CC Guide"/><ref name="W&S">{{Citation | last1 = Worrall | first1 = D.

The [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]] records that in 1067, [[Gytha Thorkelsd<U+00F3>ttir]], mother of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]], the last Anglo-Saxon king of England, stayed on the island before travelling to [[St. Omer]] in France after the [[Norman Conquest|Norman invasion of Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/1067-69.html|title=Anglo Saxon Chronicle 1067-1069|work=Britannia History|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> After the invasion, Lord [[Robert Fitzhamon]], a cousin of [[William the Conquerer]], formed the [[Glamorgan|Shire of Glamorgan]] in Wales proper, with [[Cardiff Castle]] at the centre of his new domain.

[[Image:P1000698.JPG|thumb|right|Cave and mineshaft in the east cliffs of Flat Holm]]

A survey by archaeologist Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed a number of medieval [[potsherds]] in the vicinity of the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including [[midden|middens]] containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]] shells.<ref name="HJ">{{cite journal | authorlink = H.J Thomas | title = Flat Holm | journal = Archaeological Review | pages = 91&ndash;92 | date = 1979}}</ref> Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant [[sandstone]] roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King [[Henry VIII]] granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed to Joseph Robins.<ref name="W&S"/>

During the 18th century, the island's location made it an ideal base for [[smuggling]]. An old mine shaft on the north side of the island connects with a series of natural tunnels, and a concealed exit to the sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smuggling.co.uk/gazetteer_wales_10.html|title=Smuggling in South Wales|work=Smugglers Britain|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref> Although Flat Holm was in full view of both the Welsh and English coasts, [[customs]] authorities were powerless to act as they had no boat to take them to the island. According to tradition, a small cave in the east cliff at Flat Holm was used for the storage of contraband, mainly tea and brandy.<ref name="Chaplin"/> 

[[Image:Post Office Engineers.jpg|thumb|right|Post Office Engineers inspect Marconi's equipment on Flat Holm, May 1897]]

In 1835, clergyman [[John Ashley (clergyman)|John Ashley]] from [[Clevedon]], [[England]] voluntarily ministered to the population of the island. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels in the [[Bristol Channel]]. The mission would later become the [[Mission to Seafarers]], which provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.<ref name="somharbours">{{cite book |title=Somerset Harbours |last=Farr |first=Grahame |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=49 }}</ref> A service is held annually to bless the island.

On [[May 13]], [[1897]], a 22-year-old Italian inventor named [[Guglielmo Marconi]], assisted by a [[Cardiff]] Post Office engineer named George Kemp, transmitted the first [[wireless]] signals over open sea from Flat Holm to [[Lavernock|Lavernock Point]] near [[Penarth]], [[Wales]].<ref name="marconi">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/flatholm/pages/marconi.shtml |title=Marconi: Radio Pioneer |accessdate=2008-04-12 |format= |work=BBC South East Wales }}</ref> Having failed to interest the [[Italy|Italian]] government in his project, Marconi brought his [[telegraphy]] system to Britain. There he met [[William Preece]], a Welshman, who was a major figure in the field as well as the Chief Engineer of the [[General Post Office]]. Marconi and Preece erected a 34-meter-high (111 ft) transmitter on Flat Holm as well as a 30-meter-high (98 ft) receiving mast at Lavernock Point. The first trials on the May 11 and 12 failed. On May 13, the mast at Lavernock was raised to {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} and the signals were received clearly. The message sent by [[Morse Code]] was "Are you ready"; the Morse slip signed by Marconi and Kemp is now in the [[National Museum of Wales]].<ref name="marconi"/>

The island made communication history a second time on [[8 October]] [[2002]], by becoming one of the first areas of South Wales to link to the Internet through a wireless connection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://new.wales.gov.uk/news/archivepress/enterprisepress/einpress2002/749601/?lang=en |title=Flat Holm Island makes communication history (again) |accessdate=2008-04-24 |format= |work=Welsh Assembly Government }}</ref>

==Shipwrecks==
The treacherous conditions for ships around the island also led to several shipwrecks. The British passenger vessel ''Tapley'' lost seven passengers when it became stranded on Flat Holm in January 1773 on its passage from [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]] to [[Bristol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1322712|title=Tapley|work=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> On [[October 23]], [[1817]], a British [[sloop]], the ''William and Mary'', foundered after hitting the rock islands near Flat Holm known as ''[[The Wolves]]''. The ship was en route from Bristol to [[Waterford]] and sank within fifteen minutes; the [[Sub-Lieutenant|Mate]], John Outridge, and two sailors made off in the only boat. Fifteen survivors were later rescued, having clung to the ship's rigging,<ref>{{cite news|title=The wreck of the William and Mary|last=Heineken|first=Samuel |date=Tuesday November 4th 1817|publisher=The Times}}</ref> but fifty-four other passengers were lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1046735|title=William and Mary|work=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=1817|title=Shipwreck - Loss of the William and Mary|journal=Naval Chronicle|issue=Vol 38}}</ref> Fifty of the bodies were recovered from the ship and buried on Flat Holm.<ref name="sanders">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/de/BobSanders/WRECKS.html|title=Some Bristol Channel Shipping Accidents|last=Sanders|first=Bob|work=Family history pages|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref> In 1938, the steamship ''Norman Queen'' ran ashore on Flat Holm but was refloated,<ref name="sanders"/> and in 1941 the steamship ''Middlesex'' was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pastscape.english-heritage.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1002997|title=Middlesex|work=Pastscape|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>

===Lighthouse and foghorn station===

[[Image:Flat Holm Lighthouse.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Flat Holm Lighthouse]]

Flat Holm Lighthouse is {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} above mean high water. It has a 100&ndash;watt lamp that flashes white and red every ten seconds, with a range of up to {{convert|56|km|nmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="trinityhouse">{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/flatholm.html |title=Flatholm Lighthouse |accessdate=2008-02-17 |format= |work=Trinity House }}</ref> 

The first light on the island was a simple [[brazier]] mounted on a wooden frame, which stood on the high eastern part of the island.<ref name="W&S"/> In 1733 the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] of Bristol found the brazier to be unreliable and petitioned the [[General Lighthouse Authority]], [[Trinity House]], for an actual lighthouse, but the petition failed.<ref name="trinityhouse"/>  In 1735 Mr. William Crispe of Bristol submitted a proposal to build a lighthouse at his own expense. This initial proposal also failed but negotiations resumed in 1736 when 60&nbsp;soldiers drowned after their vessel crashed on ''the Wolves'' rocks near Flat Holm. Following this disaster, the [[Society of Merchant Venturers]] finally supported William Crispe's proposal.<ref name="Chaplin">{{cite book | last = Chaplin | first = Captain W.R. | title = he History of Flat Holm Lighthouse | publisher = Reprinted from the American Neptune V. XX  | date = 1960 }} </ref> Crispe agreed to pay <U+00A3>800 (<U+00A3>110,552, $220,241 in 2008) for the construction of the tower as well as the fees permits.<ref name="W&S"/> The tower finished construction in 1737, and began operating on [[March 25]], [[1738]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/pls/portal/coflein.w_details?inumlink=6060979|title=Flat Holm Lighthouse, Flat Holm Island|publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref>

[[Image:Foghorn building on Flat Hom Island.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Foghorn building]]

The lighthouse was struck by lightning in a severe storm on [[December 22]], [[1790]]. The [[Lighthouse keeper|keeper]] narrowly escaped, and the top of the tower was severely damaged; a ten-foot-tall crack on the side had to be repaired as did the oak beams supporting the top platform.<ref name="Chaplin"/> In 1819, the circular stone tower was updated to house a more powerful lantern; the tower was raised from {{convert|21|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}. A clockwork mechanism to rotate the light was installed in 1881.<ref name="W&S"/> Flat Holm Lighthouse was the last signal station in the country in private ownership. In July 1822, Trinity House finally bought the lease for <U+00A3>15,838.10 (<U+00A3>1.2 million, $2.4 million in 2008).<ref name="W&S"/> Two years later a fountain oil lamp was installed and the lantern was raised by another {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In 1867 a lantern {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was installed.<ref name="trinityhouse"/> The lighthouse was renovated in 1929 to include accommodations for up to four keepers. This lasted until 1988, when the lighthouse became fully automated and the keepers withdrew. In 1997, the light was modernised and converted to solar power. It is now monitored and controlled by the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at [[Harwich]], in [[Essex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/interactive/gallery/flatholm.html|title=Flat Holm Lighthouse history|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>

Built by [[Trinity House]] in 1906, the [[Foghorn]] building is a [[Grade II listed building]].<ref name="foghorn"/> The siren was originally powered by a 15hp engine, which gave two blasts in quick succession at two minute intervals that could be clearly heard by people living on both coasts.<ref name="Lovell">{{cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Dennis|date=July 1955|title=Secrets of a Severn Isle|journal=Somerset Countryman}}</ref> Volunteers from the Flat Holm Society, with help from the [[Prince's Trust]], restored the horn and engines 1960s. The Fog Horn Station was officially reopened by The [[Secretary of State for Wales|Welsh Secretary]] and the [[First Minister for Wales|Welsh Assembly First Secretary]] in May 2000 when the foghorn was sounded for the first time since 1988.<ref name="foghorn">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/730653.stm |title=Tourism hope for island's foghorn |accessdate=2008-04-24 |format= |work=BBC Wales }}</ref>

===Farm House===

[[Image:Flat Holm Farm House.JPG|thumb|right|Flat Holm Farm House]]

Records indicate that monks from [[St Augustine's Abbey]] established a dairy farm and [[Monastic grange|grange]] on the island after Flat Holm was granted to the religious society.<ref name="barrett">{{Citation |first = John | last = Barrett | title = The Grave Slabs of Flat Holm and Steep Holm | year = 1998 | pages = 15 | place = Chippenham Wilts | publisher = Antony Rowe Ltd}}</ref> Dr. Thomas Turner, who was stranded on Flat Holm during a visit in 1815, passed the time by exploring the island. He noted that the tax-exempt abbey farm was prospering and counted "seven cows, two bulls, five sheep one horse, two pigs and two dogs".<ref name="Turner"/> The 1881 census record for Flat Holm shows that the farmhouse was later occupied by Henry and Emily Morgan, their four sons and four daughters, a governess (Henry's niece), and Emma Craddock, a 14-year-old servant.<ref name="census">{{Cite web | title = 1881 Flat Holm Census |url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d8/FlatHolm1881.pdf | accessdate = 2008-05-22}}</ref> In 1897 the farmhouse was converted into the Flat Holm Hotel, and a bar and skittle alley were added, but the hotel closed after a few years.<ref name="W&S"/> The farmhouse has been renovated by the Flat Holm Project and is now used as accommodation for visitors staying on the island.

===Batteries and barracks===

[[Image:Montcrieff Gun as installed on Flat Holm island.jpg|thumb|right|Moncrieff 'disappearing gun']]

Flat Holm was fortified in the 1860s following a visit by [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Prince Albert]] to [[France]], where they had been concerned by the strength of the French Navy. The [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]], under direction of [[Lord Palmerston]], recommended fortification of the coast in 1865. The defences on the island, which became part of a line of defences known as the [[Palmerston Forts, Bristol Channel|Palmerston Forts]], were completed in 1869.<ref name="W&S"/>

Flat Holm Battery is a series of gun emplacements on Flat Holm built to protect [[Bristol]] and [[Cardiff]] across the channel. There are remains of four battery sites on the island:<ref name="palmerston">{{cite journal | authorlink = Duncan Williams and Tony Sharp | title = FortLog Bristol Channel| journal = Palmerston Forts Society | date = Updated August 2002}}</ref>

[[Image:Flat Holm Battery sites.jpg|thumb|left|Flat Holm Battery sites]]

* '''Lighthouse Battery''' three guns in two full Moncrieff pits and one open-backed pit<ref name=fhbatteries/>}}

These four emplacements run from the northern to the southern point of the island, along the western coast. Nine [[Rifled Muzzle Loader|Rifled muzzle loaders (RMLs)]] on disappearing [[Disappearing gun|Moncrieff carriages]] were built at the [[Royal Arsenal|Royal Gun Foundry]], [[Woolwich]]. They were mounted in four separate batteries, all in Moncrieff pits, {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep, constructed of limestone blocks and bricks. These pits had the advantage of being almost invisible to shipping and also offered protection to the gun crews.  The guns were constructed of wrought iron sections and weighed 7&nbsp;tons, making them too heavy land service. They consisted of a rifle tube and [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]]. The overall length of each gun is {{convert|361|cm|in|0}}. They used a {{convert|52.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Palliser]] shell and were mounted on the Moncrieff disappearing carriage.<ref name="palmerston"/>  The guns were never needed so were only fired for test purposes.<ref name="W&S"/> 
[[Image:Flat Holm Canon.jpg|thumb|right|Canon and Moncrieff Pit near the lighthouse]]

In 1869, stone barracks were built to sleep up to 50 men.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flatholm.co.uk/fhsnews/2004/fhs%202004%20fort.html|title=Flat Holm Society Newsletter Spring 2004|accessdate=2008-06-19}}</ref> However, the 1881 Census for Flat Holm shows that the the barracks were occupied only by the Master Gunner, Thomas Barrett, his family, and five soldiers.<ref name="census"/> Barrett's son, Albert, was born on the island on the [[December 31]], [[1881]].<ref>{{Citation |last = John |first = Barrett| title = Record of Army Service, Master Gunner Thomas Barrett }}</ref> The men were stationed on the island to keep the guns in good working order but the garrison woul dhave been reinforced by regular artillery and volunteer troops if an invasion was imminent.<ref name="forts">{{Citation | last1 = Barrett | first1 = John | title = A History of Maritime Forts in the Bristol Channel | year = 1983 }}</ref> The barracks for the battery were located near the southernmost battery emplacement. Other fortifications included a large drainage basin, underground storage tank, an administrative building, and asecure store. A "ditch-and-bank" system served to protect the Lighthouse Battery from cross-island attack. The barracks were vacated in 1901 and the buildings have now been restored by the Flat Holm Project for educational use.<ref name="forts"/>

===Radar station===

At the outbreak of [[World War II]] over 350 soldiers of the [[Royal Artillery]], were stationed on the island.<ref name="W&S"/> Flat Holm was re-armed with four [[QF 4.5 inch naval gun|4.5-inch guns]] and associated [[searchlights]] to be used for anti-aircraft and close defence, together with two {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[Bofors]] guns.<ref name="palmerston"/> A GL (Gun Loading) MkII [[radar]] station was also placed in the centre of the island.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/51/a1299251.shtml|title=Radar#2|work=WW2 People's War|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-05-07}}</ref><ref name="W&S"/> The structures formed part of the Fixed Defences, and protected the Atlantic shipping convoys between Cardiff, Barry, and Flat Holm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/pls/portal/coflein.w_details?inumlink=6081138|title=Flat Holm Coastal and Anti-Aircraft Defences|publisher=Royal Commission on the  Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales|accessdate=2008-04-29}}</ref> These works were abandoned after the war and the island has had no military use since.

In 1975, the [[South Glamorgan]] County Council leased the island for the next 99 years.<ref name="W&S"/> In March 1995, the county council agreed to obtain Flat Holm through a 50-year lease from the [[Crown Estate]] starting on [[December 12]],

==Geography==

Flat Holm is located in the [[Bristol Channel]]. It is a small, almost circular, limestone island, approximately {{convert|620|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, covering {{convert|35|ha|acre|abbr=on}}. It rises in a gentle slope from the exposed western rocky shore to more sheltered easterly cliffs, at the top of which stands the prominent lighthouse. At its highest point it is {{convert|32|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Flat Holm is considered to be part of [[Wales]], whereas the nearby island of [[Steep Holm]] is considered part of [[England]]. About {{convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest of Flat Holm are two very small islands collectively known as ''[[The Wolves]]'', measuring approximately {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The [[tidal range]] in the Bristol Channel is {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}};<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/severnpositionmay2006_1508223.pd | format= PDF | work= UK Environment Agency | title= Severn Estuary Barrage | date= [[31 May]] [[2006]] | accessdate= 2007-09-03 }}</ref> second only to [[Bay of Fundy]] in [[Eastern Canada]].<ref>{{cite book | title= Extreme Depositional Environments: Mega End Members in Geologic Time

==Geology==

[[Image:Flat Holm Geology.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Flat Holm geology]]

During much of the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice ages]], from 1.8 million years ago, the sea level in the [[Severn Estuary]] was some {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the current level and Flat Holm was joined to the Somerset coast as an extremity of the [[Mendip Hills]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Knight | first = Francis | title = The Sea-Board of Mendip.

Flat Holm and Steep Holm form a link with the [[carboniferous]] limestones of the west of England, [[Sully Island]] and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry, Wales]]. Part of the island is designated a [[Geological Conservation Review]] (GCR) Site and is a recognised [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=4174&gcr=2886 |title= Flat Holm, Bristol Channel (Dinantian of Southern England & South Wales) |accessdate=2008-04-29 |format= |work=Geological Conservation Review (GCR) }}</ref> The GCR and SSSI interest lies along the south-western shoreline from the north west point to Lighthouse Point; a wave cut portion of the limestone displays large [[fossil]] "ripple marks".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/ObjView.asp?Object_ID=3598&language=&xxx=0 |title=Flat Holm |accessdate=2008-04-29 |format=PDF |work=Cardiff Council }}</ref> 

There are old [[galena]] that are argentiferous (i.e., silver-bearing) and the pits and mounds visible on the surface of the island are as a result of trial [[Boring (mechanical)|borings]]. A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with [[John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart]] making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using the coals from the light for processing lead.<ref>{{cite journal|coauthors=S. D. & J. N.

==Flora and fauna==

Flat Holm was designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) in 1972.  The designation covers the [[Maritime cliff communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system|maritime grassland]] which is mainly concentrated around the edges of the island.<ref name=bbc-about>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southeast/sites/flatholm/pages/overview.shtml | publisher= BBC | title= Flat Holm - About the island | date= [[3 April]] [[2008]] | accessdate= 2008-04-12}}</ref>

[[Image:Limonium binervosum1.jpg|thumb|right|Rock Sea Lavender]]

There are no [[Endemism|endemic]] plant species but the relative isolation of the island has allowed a number of hardy species such as [[Lotus corniculatus|Bird's-foot Trefoil]] ''(Lotus corniculatus)'' and [[Sedum acre|Biting Stonecrop]] ''(Sedum acre)'' to thrive. There are also a number of relatively rare plants, such as [[Limonium binervosum|Rock Sea-Lavender]] ''(Limonium binervosum)'', and [[Wild Leek]] (''Allium ampeloprasum''). The leek grows to {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} and Flat Holm is one of only five places in the UK where it is found.<ref name=bbc-about/> Related to the onion, the leek has a bulb that grows for several years producing only leaves, then blooms with large purple flowers that smell of garlic. After flowering the bulb dies and produces up to 150 bulblets.

Others plants may have been introduced by the [[Augustinian]] Community for their medicinal uses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/comindx.html |title=A Modern Herbal |accessdate=2008-04-12 |author=M.Grieve }}</ref> These include [[Geranium molle|Dove's-foot Crane's-bill]] ''Geranium molle'', an [[anodyne]] plant claimed by [[Nicholas Culpeper]] to have a wide range of medicinal uses and an ''"excellent good cure for those that have inward wounds, hurts, or bruises, both to stay the bleeding, to dissolve and expel the congealed blood, and to heal the parts, as also to cleanse and heal outward sores, ulcers and fistulas"''.<ref>Culpeper, Nicholas, The English physician: or an astrologo-physical discourse of the vulgar herbs of this nation. London : Peter Cole, 1652</ref> The [[Paeonia mascula|Wild Peony]] ''(Paeonia mascula)'' was introduced to the island (and nearby Steep Holm), possibly by monks,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peonysociety.org.uk/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=10 |title=Paeonia mascula on Steep Holm |accessdate=2008-04-26 |format= |work=Peony Society }}</ref> and has naturalised. 37 plants were taken to the island from Steep Holm by Frank Harris, the farmer at the time, in the 1930s, many of which died during the [[World War II]] occupation and fortification of the island. One remaining plant was reintroduced by David Worall, the Flat Holm Warden, in [[1982]] and is protected by fencing near the path to the [[Flat_Holm#Lighthouse|lighthouse]]. A few plants grown from seed also survive in the island's farmhouse garden.<ref>''Cardiff Council Flat Holm Project Records'', accessed 2008-05-08</ref>

[[Image:Anguis fragilis 20050721 002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Slow Worm]]

The island has a significant breeding colony of over 4,000 pairs of [[Lesser Black-backed Gull]]s (''Larus fuscus''), 400 pairs of [[Herring Gull]]s (''Larus argentatus''), 2&nbsp;pairs of [[Great Black-backed Gull]]s (''Larus marinus'') and varying numbers of [[Common Shelduck]] (''Tadorna tadorna'') and [[Eurasian Oystercatcher]]s (''Haematopodidae''). The feeding habits of Lesser Black-backed Gulls was studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid than in previous years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hiom |first=Louise |authorlink= |coauthors=Mark Bolton, Pat Monaghan & David Worrall |year=1991 |month= |title=Experimental evidence for food limitation of egg production in gulls |journal=Ornis Scandinavica |volume=22 |issue= |pages=94<U+2013>97 |id= |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/3676539 |accessdate= |quote=|doi=10.2307/3676539 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Bolton |first=Mark |authorlink= |coauthors=David Houston & Pat Monaghan |year=1992 |month= |title=Nutritional constraints on egg formation in the lesser black-backed gull: an experimental study|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=61 |issue= |pages=521<U+2013>532 |id= |url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/5607 |accessdate= |quote=|doi=10.2307/5607 }}</ref>

The island is also home to [[slow worm]]s (''Anguis fragilis''). Flat Holm's slow-worm population has unusually large blue markings. There is a population of [[rabbit]]s which were introduced to the island for farming in the 12th century.<ref name="W&S"/> These suffer from [[Mixamatosis]] with the result that the numbers are contained. The island has been grazed since 1989, initially by goats, but by sheep since 1997. [[Soay sheep]] were introduced in 1992, and as of 2008 there are 28 of them grazing wild on the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiff.gov.uk/objview.asp?Object_ID=3750& |title=Habitat action plan for Cardiff |accessdate=2008-04-12 |format=PDF |work=Cardiff Council }}</ref>

==Sustainability==

[[Image:PV Array at Flat Holm.JPG|thumb|upright|right|PV array at Flat Holm]]

The Flat Holm project aims to develop the island as a showcase of sustainable technologies.  The original power supply consisted of several diesel generators at different properties which were not connected to each other. In 2006, underground cables were installed to form a <U+2018>mini-grid<U+2019> between the farmhouse, workshops and the fog horn keeper's cottage. This was powered with a (13.5&nbsp;kW) inverter/charger system located at the farmhouse with the farmhouse diesel generator as back-up. 

In 2007 the system was extended to include a battery bank charged by two [[photovoltaic]] [[Photovoltaic module|solar arrays]], and by a 6&nbsp;kW [[wind turbine]] sited at the high point of the island where a redundant telecommunications tower was located.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windandsun.co.uk/projects_flatholm.htm|title=Flat Holm Island PV & Wind System|work=Wind and Sun Ltd|accessdate=2008-04-14}}</ref>

==Severn Barrage study==

[[Image:Barrage view.jpg|thumb|right|Artists impression of the proposed Barrage]]

If a [[Severn Barrage]] were ever to be constructed it could have consequences for Flat Holm, depending on the design and the route. A number of studies have been proposed, the latest being when [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]], [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]], announced a further feasibility study on [[September 25]], [[2007]] to follow on the report by the Sustainable Development Commission.

The proposal for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6&nbsp;GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2531329.ece |title=Severn Barrage study alarms campaigners |accessdate=2007-09-26 |format= |work=Times Online | date= [[25 September]] [[2007]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/7013068.stm |title=New study for Severn energy plan |accessdate=2007-09-26 |format= |work=[[BBC News]] | date= [[25 September]] [[2007]] }}</ref> This proposed barrage would pass two miles west of Flat Holm.<ref>[http://www.marinet.org.uk/refts/severn.html Tidal Power in the Severn? (accessed 2008-05-12)]</ref> The study is expected to last at least two years. The study will be split into two stages with a decision point at the end of each. The first, which is likely to run until late 2008, will focus on high level issues and reach an initial view on whether there are any fundamental issues that would preclude a tidal scheme in the Severn Estuary. Subject to the decision at the end of the first phase, the second phase will look at the issues in more detail and culminate in a full public consultation in early 2010.<ref>[http://www.berr.gov.uk/files/file43809.pdf Severn Tidal Power Q&A (accessed 2008-05-12)]</ref>
