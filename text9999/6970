The '''murder of Laurie Show''' occurred on December 21, 1991. Show was a 16-year-old sophomore student at [[Conestoga Valley High School]]. Show's body was discovered in her [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] home on December 21, 1991 by her mother Hazel Show, with Show's throat cut.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anthony|first=Ted|title=Teen's Slaying Killed Mother's Dreams but Fired Her Ambition|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-19/news/mn-36927_1_laurie-show|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 19, 1993}}</ref> 

Classmates Lisa Michelle Lambert, Tabitha Buck, and Lawrence "Butch" Yunkin were charged with her murder.

==Stalking and murder==
Lambert initially began harassing Show in 1991 after learning that Show briefly dated Yunkin over the summer. Lambert and Yunkin had had a previous relationship with each other, but had reportedly not been dating during the time Yunkin was dating Show. Show and Yunkin had gone on a few dates, with Show reporting to her mother that Yunkin had [[date rape]]d her.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marder|first=Dianna|title=Jealousy led teen to kill rival for boyfriend's affections|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D280D7596016&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=November 15, 1992}}</ref> Shortly after his final date with Show, Yunkin resumed dating Lambert, who was pregnant with his child.

On December 21, 1991 Show's body was discovered in her home by her mother, with the body showing several wounds.

==1992 trials==
Lambert, Buck, and Yunkin were each tried for the murder of Laurie Show.

===Verdicts===
Lambert was convicted on July 20, 1992 for the charges of first-degree murder and criminal conspiracy in the death of Show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Woman guilty of killing boyfriend's former date|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0EFABC3058A6E&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Washington Times|date=JULY 21, 1992}}</ref> Buck was also convicted for similar charges, with both Lambert and Buck receiving the sentence of life in prison without parole.<ref>{{cite news|title=Teen gets life in murder of girl|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=roo0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=_aIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5989,13175&dq=laurie-show+murder&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=Oct 1, 1992}}</ref> Lambert was initially sentenced to the [[State Correctional Institution <U+2013> Cambridge Springs|Cambridge Springs State Correctional Institution]] and Buck was sentenced to the [[State Correctional Institution <U+2013> Muncy|Muncy State Correctional Institution]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Convicted Pa. murderer wins $35,000 settlement|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/breaking/s_525635.html#axzz2GKXF4NFA|publisher=Tribune-Review|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>

==1997 re-trial==
Lambert appealed the 1992 conviction and in 1997, appeared in court for a federal habeas corpus hearing.<ref name="LAT1" /> U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell presided over the trial. Lambert's lawyers claimed that there were several inconsistencies with the evidence and testimony given in the earlier trial and that Lambert was innocent. Lambert also alleged that she had been framed by Lancaster police officers in order to keep her from coming forward with charges that they had gang-raped her.<ref>{{cite news|title=Prison guard rape case to proceed|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fQEyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TKIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3741,3001924&dq=lambert+laurie-show+appeal&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=Jul 6, 2007}}</ref> Evidence provided in the re-trial included the sweatpants shown in the 1992 hearing as well as correspondence between Yunkin and Lambert. Dalzell overturned the murder conviction on April 15, 1997, citing that "prosecutorial misconduct" had resulted in an incorrect ruling.<ref name="TruTV" /> Dalzell also barred the state of Pennsylvania from re-trying Lambert.<ref name="LAT1" /> Dalzell's ruling was later overturned in January 1997 by a federal appeals panel that stated that Lambert had "not yet exhausted her appeals in state court" and Lambert was taken back to prison.<ref name="AT1">{{cite news|title=Murder Suspect Says Death Is Preferable To Prison|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FgFWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8EANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1461,1925076&dq=lambert+dalzell+show&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Allegheny Times|date=Jan 11, 1998}}</ref>

==1998 appeal==
After the Dalzell's ruling was overturned, the federal court system debated over whether or not to keep Lambert in jail or to uphold Dalzell's verdict.<ref>{{cite news|title=Federal court to decide whether Lambert can be freed|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fyMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qeYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5511,1458061&dq=lambert+laurie-show+appeal&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Gettysburg Times|date=May 14, 1998}}</ref> Lambert filed an appeal for a hearing over the second overturning of the verdict, but was denied.<ref>{{cite news|title=Federal appeals court refuses to hear Lambert's request|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Wos0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=76YFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6016,6274883&dq=lambert+dalzell+show&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=Jan 27, 1998}}</ref> In February 1998 the [[Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] returned the case to the Lancaster County Court system, stating that Lambert "must first take up her claims [there]".<ref>{{cite news|title=PA.

Stengel]] oversaw the trial. Various witnesses were called to testify against Lambert, including the detective that had overseen the 1991 murder case as well as Lambert's accomplices Buck and Yunkin.

Lambert now testified that Yunkin had participated in the murders, choking Show.

Buck denied these claims, testifying that Lambert had actively participated in the murder and that she had told Buck to "wear her hair up and not to wear make-up or fingernail polish".<ref name="TruTV" /><ref>{{cite news|title=Witness: Defendant slit girl's throat as if 'cutting bread'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=siZdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y1oNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2036,2519549&dq=laurie-show+murder&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Observer-Reporter|date=Jun 17, 1998}}</ref> Yunkin was later brought to the stand and the sweatpants that had been re-introduced in the 1997 trial as belonging to him were produced.

In August 1998 Judge Stengel announced his verdict, stating that he would uphold the original guilty verdict against Lambert and that "even if he believed [her] story ... she would still be guilty of first-degree murder as an accomplice".<ref>{{cite news|title=News Watch|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3AAyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xuYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4765,2333727&dq=laurie-show+lambert+letter&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Gettysburg Times|date=August 24, 1998}}</ref> Federal Judge [[Anita Brody]] later upheld this verdict.

==Aftermath==

===Anti-stalking activism===
After her daughter's death in 1991, Helen Show started campaigning for stronger anti-stalking laws in Pennsylvania. Show's murder helped push forward anti-stalking legislation,<ref>{{cite web|title=Laurie is never far from their minds|url=http://lancasteronline.com/article/local/553677_Laurie-is-never-far-from-their-minds.html|publisher=Lancaster Online|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> with new laws signed into effect in June 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slain teen's mother turns grief into war on stalking|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KGQxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=O6IFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3678,2727086&dq=laurie-show+yunkin&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=July 6, 1993}}</ref>

===1996 rape charges===
In 2007 Lambert appeared in court to sue the correctional institution over claims that she was raped and assaulted by state prison staff in 1996. Lambert's lawyer argued that the institution had done nothing to stop the assaults and that Lambert's conviction would impede her from having a fair trial.<ref name="PP12007">{{cite web|title=State Settles Prison Rape Suit|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VodIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JnIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1672,1736083&dq=laurie-show+murder&hl=en|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> Lambert received a $35,000 settlement, with the guard accused of assaulting her serving a 1 1/2 to 3 year sentence.<ref name="PP12007" />

==Media==
An hour-long special episode of ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'' was aired in February 1999 which featured interviews with several classmates that said that Lambert had voiced death threats against Show as well as evidence that one of the officers that allegedly raped Lambert was on a honeymoon during the time the rape occurred.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lambert defense focus of TV show|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WCMyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QaYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2857,3758124&dq=lambert+dalzell+show&hl=en|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=February 24, 1999}}</ref>   The murder was also featured on a season 8 episode of ''[[American Justice]]'', titled "A Teenage Murder Mystery".<ref>{{cite web|title=American Justice Episode Guide|url=http://www.aetv.com/american_justice/aj_episode_guide.jsp?episode=1232177|publisher=AE TV|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref> 

In 2000 the Show murder was adapted into a made for TV film entitled ''[[The Stalking of Laurie Show]]''. The film was directed by Norma Bailey and starred [[Jennifer Finnigan]] as Laurie Show. Critical reception for the film was poor, with one journalist commenting that the film's distortion of Show and Lambert took away from the crime.<ref name="LAJ">{{cite web|title='Stalking of Laurie Show' distorts truth of tragedy|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/120900/ent_120900011.shtml|publisher=Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>

In 2001 writer and journalist Lyn Riddle wrote ''Overkill'', which covered Show's murder and the resulting trials for Lambert and her accomplices.
