==Plot==
Homer notices that [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]] are enjoying unexplainable privileges such as free soft drinks, good chairs and great parking spots at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. Homer investigates and discovers that they are part of an ancient secret society known as The Stonecutters. When he tries to join, he learns that in order to gain membership, one must either be the son of a Stonecutter or save the life of a Stonecutter. Homer complains about not being let in, and reveals to Marge that he has always been excluded from clubs; when he was young, a group of children formed the "No Homers Club" and did not allow him to join. While extolling the Stonecutters at the dinner table, he discovers that [[Abraham Simpson|his father]] is a member and is admitted. 

After joining the Stonecutters, which is made up of many of the male characters on the show, Homer takes great pleasure in the Society's secret privileges, such as an underground byway  past Springfield's traffic jams, the Society's drinking bouts and free roller-skates. Unfortunately, during a celebratory [[ribs (food)|rib]] dinner with his fellow Stonecutters, he unwittingly uses the society<U+2019>s Hallowed Sacred Parchment as a [[napkin]], [[facial tissue|tissue]] and [[Cotton swab|Q-tip]], destroying it. He is stripped of his Stonecutter robes and as part of his punishment is forced to walk home naked dragging the "stone of shame". Before he leaves, however, it is discovered that Homer has a birthmark in the shape of the Stonecutter emblem, identifying him as "The Chosen One" who, it was foretold, would lead the Stonecutters to greatness. 

Homer is crowned as the new leader of The Stonecutters. Initially enjoying himself, Homer soon feels isolated by his power and asks Lisa for advice. She suggests he have the Stonecutters to do volunteer work to help the community. This angers the Stonecutters, who convene their World Council and consider killing Homer. They finally decide against it, and realizing that Homer will control them for as long as they are members, they instead break off to form a new society "The Ancient Mystic Society of No Homers". Homer is not allowed to join.

Homer becomes despondent about losing his secret club and replaces every member with monkeys. Marge consoles him by telling him he is a member of a "very exclusive club": The Simpson Family. The family then subjects him to some [[hazing]] and [[Paddle (spanking)|paddling]]. "This club better be worth it!" Homer cries out while being paddled.

==Production==
Although "Homer the Great" was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], the story was suggested by executive producer [[David Mirkin]]. Mirkin did not have enough time to write the episode and asked Swartzwelder to do it. Mirkin came up with the idea while driving home from a rewrite early in the morning and listened to a religious radio channel where they were talking about [[Freemasonry]]. Mirkin decided it would make a great episode, where everyone in Springfield was a member of a Masonic society and Homer was left on the outside and felt neglected.<ref name="Mirkin">Mirkin, David.

The song "We Do" was not included in the original script and was suggested by [[Matt Groening]]. It was written by the writer's room, who threw in as many things that annoyed them as they possibly could.<ref name="Mirkin"/> It was described as "one of the series<U+2019> best musical numbers" by Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide,<ref name=dvdmg/> and was later included in the clip show "[[All Singing, All Dancing]]".<ref>{{cite book  | last =Martyn  | first =Warren  |  coauthors =Adrian Wood  | title =I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide  | publisher =Virgin Books  | year =2000  |  pages =Section: "All Singing, All Dancing: The Simpsons go musical for one episode only"  | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season9/page11.shtml}}</ref>

The episode guest stars [[Patrick Stewart]] as Number One.
