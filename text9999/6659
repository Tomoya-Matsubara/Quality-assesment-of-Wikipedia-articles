'''Christina of Garmoran''' also known as '''Christina MacRuari''', '''Christina of Mar''' and '''Christiana of the Isles''' was a 14th century Scottish noblewoman who was the legitimate child of Ailin (Alan) mac Ruaidhri, Lord of [[Garmoran]] and chief of [[Clan Macruari]].<ref name=L61>Lee (1920) p. 61</ref><ref>[http://www.clandonaldeurope.org/ClanDonald/History_2.html "The History"]. clandonaldeurope.org. Retrieved 23 April 2011.</ref><ref name=B347> Barrow (2003) p. 347</ref> She married Duncan, second son of  [[Domhnall I, Earl of Mar]]. 


== Family background ==
Christina was a direct descendant of the [[Kingdom of the Isles|King of the Hebrides]], ''[[Somerled|Somhairle mac Gille-Brighde]]''  (better known as Somerled), through her grandfather [[Ruaidhri mac Raghnaill]], the founder of Clan Macruari. 

Her father, Ailin mac Ruaidhri, possessed the "North Isles" of the [[Uist]]s and [[Benbecula]]. He is known to have attended [[Parliament of Scotland|Parliament]] in 1285 when the succession of [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] was debated. He had died by 1296, by which time he had fathered two illegitimate sons, Ruaidhri and Lachlan, and Christina, his sole legitimate heir. However, When Christina succeeded to the extensive estates of her father (Garmoran and the North Isles including [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]] and the [[Small Isles]] of [[R<U+00F9>m]]) and [[Eigg]]) she resigned a large proportion of them to Ruaidhri.<ref name=B347/><ref>Gregory (1881) pp. 24, 27</ref>

When her distant cousin [[Alexander of Argyll]]'s support of the opponents of King [[Robert the Bruce]] led to the forfeiture of his lands, they were distributed between her [[Clan Donald|MacDonald]] cousin [[Aonghas <U+00D3>g of Islay]] and her brother Ruaidhri. The latter received much of [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorne]] and parts of [[Lochaber]]. Bruce was however careful to ensure his interests in the west were protected and [[Dunstaffnage Castle]] was given not to Ruari, now styled the "High Chief of Lorn" but to a royal constable, Arthur Campbell.<ref>Gregory (1881) p. 25</ref> Campbell's son, also Arthur, received a charter of lands from Christina, at some point early in the 14th century and they may have been considering marriage although this never came to pass. The charter itself seems to have been disputed by parties on both sides for the next century.<ref>[http://generation13.net/MacDonald/MacArthur.html "MacArthur"]. Generation 13.net. Retrieved 30 April 2011.</ref>

==Marriage and politics==
Christina did marry Duncan, second son of [[Domhnall I, Earl of Mar]], making her the Bruce's sister-in-law twice over. (Duncan's sister [[Isabella of Mar]] married Robert the Bruce and his older brother [[Gartnait, Earl of Mar]] married Robert's sister [[Christina Bruce|Christina]].)<ref name=M47>MacDonald (2008) p. 47</ref><ref>Barrow (2003) p. 219</ref>{{#tag:ref| According to Lee (1920) she married Domhnall I himself rather than his son, and thus became the grandmother of [[Robert II of Scotland]].<ref name=L81>Lee (1920) p. 81</ref> However, this is described as erroneous by MacDonald (2008), who states that "most sources agree" that she married Duncan.|group="Note"}} No details of Christina's birth are known, but Duncan was born in 1294, and died in 1332 and they are recorded as having a child, [[Margaret, Countess of Mar]], who married [[William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas]] and died in 1390.<ref>[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&db=geolarson2&id=I069165 "An Extended Family - Entries: 273404"] RootsWeb. Retrieved 22 May 2011.</ref>

Christina is credited with being instrumental in supporting [[Robert the Bruce]] ascend to the Scottish throne. [[John of Fordun]] records her as "Christian of the Isles" and stated that "it was by her help and power and goodwill that Bruce was able to return to Carrick".<ref name=B347/> [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]] wrote that: "A lady of that country [Carrick], who was his near kinswoman, was wondrous glad at his arrival and made haste to join him, bringing fifteen men whom she gave the king to help him in his warfare."<ref name=M47/> It is also possible that she and Aonghas <U+00D3>g of Islay provided assistance to Bruce whilst he sought refuge on [[Rathlin Island]].<ref name=M47/>

==Later Clan Macruari history==
The MacRuari's added [[Barra]] to their lands in 1309<ref name=R27>Rotary Club (1995) p. 27</ref> but towards the close of the Bruce's reign, c. 1325, Ruaidhri was dispossessed for engaging in plots perceived to be against his king's interests.<ref>Gregory (1881) p. 25</ref> 

[[Edward Balliol]] may have restored these lands to his son, Raghnall mac Ruari, a state of affairs confirmed by [[David II of Scotland|David II]] c. 1344, who formally granted him Garmoran and the North Isles, although Lorn was retained by the crown and Lochaber in its entirety given to [[John of Islay, Lord of the Isles|John of islay]] the first [[Lord of the Isles]] who had married [[Amy of Garmoran|Amie]], Christina's niece in 1337.<ref>Lamont (1966) p. 25</ref> Shortly thereafter, in October 1346, Raghnall was assassinated at [[Elcho Castle|Elcho Nunnery]] near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] as the result of a quarrel with [[Uilleam III, Earl of Ross]]. He was the "last chieftain of the MacRuaris"<ref name=H127>Hunter (2000) p. 127</ref> and Amie was his sole heir.<ref>Gregory (1881) pp. 26-27</ref><ref>Lee (1920) p. 82</ref><ref name=O124>Oram (2005) pp. 124-26</ref> Amie's son Ranald became the progenitor of Clan Macdonald of Clanranald and [[Clan MacDonell of Glengarry]]<ref name=L61/><ref name=G30>Gregory (1881) pp. 30-31</ref><ref>Lee (1920) p. 50</ref>

Amie also continued various works of a religious nature that her aunt had supported. Christina gifted the lands of Carinsh in [[North Uist]] to [[Inchaffray Abbey]] and Amie rebuilt the [[Teampull na Trionaid]] on this estate.<ref>Thomas, F. W. L. (December 1871) "Notices of Three Churches in North Uist, Benbecula, and
Grimsay, said to have been Built in the Fourteenth Century". ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''.</ref><ref>Barrow (2003) p. 220</ref>

==In fiction==
Christina is a character in the novel ''Robert the Bruce: The Steps to the Empty Throne'' by [[Nigel Tranter]] in which her support of Robert Bruce is portrayed.  They meet at sea when Bruce repulses an attack on her ships and there are suggestions of a romantic association between the two.
