'''Ronald Ernest "Ron" Paul''' (born August 20, 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congressman|Congressman]] for the [[Texas's 14th congressional district|14th congressional district]] of [[Texas]]. Paul serves on the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]], the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]], the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services |Committee on Financial Services]] and is Chairman of the [[United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology|House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy]] where he has been an outspoken critic of American foreign and monetary policy. He has gained prominence for his [[Right-libertarianism|libertarian]] positions on many political issues, often clashing with both Republican and Democratic Party leaders. Paul has run for [[President of the United States]] twice, first in 1988 as the nominee of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and again in 2008 as a candidate for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential candidates, 2008|Republican nomination]].

He is the founder of the [[advocacy group]] [[Campaign for Liberty]] and his ideas have been expressed in numerous published articles and books, including ''[[End The Fed]]'' (2009), ''[[The Revolution: A Manifesto]]'' (2008), ''[[Pillars of Prosperity]]'' (2008), ''[[A Foreign Policy of Freedom: Peace, Commerce, and Honest Friendship]]'' (2007), ''[[The Case for Gold]]'' (1982), and a new book ''[[Liberty Defined: 50 Essential Issues That Affect Our Freedom]]'' (2011) due out in April. According to a 1998 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Political Science]]'', Paul has the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress since 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voteview.com/Is_John_Kerry_A_Liberal.htm|title=Is John Kerry a Liberal?|accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref> His son [[Rand Paul]] was sworn in as a [[United States Senate|Senator]] for [[Kentucky]] in 2011, making the elder Paul the first Representative in history to serve alongside a son or daughter in the Senate.

==Personal life==
Paul was born in [[Pittsburgh]] to Howard and Margaret (n<U+00E9>e Dumont) Paul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/paul.html|title=The Ancestors of Ron Paul|author=Reitweisner, William Addams|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> As a junior at [[Keystone Oaks High School|Dormont High School]], he was the [[200 metres|220-yard dash]] [[Pennsylvania|state]] [[championship|champion]].<ref name=PTR/>
He received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[biology]] at [[Gettysburg College]] in 1957.

Paul's son Rand is the junior senator from the state of Kentucky.

==Early congressional career==
While still a medical resident in the 1960s, Paul was influenced by [[Friedrich Hayek]]<U+2019>s ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'', which led him to read many works of [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]]. He came to know economists [[Hans Sennholz]] and [[Murray Rothbard]] well, and credits to them his interest in the study of economics. He came to believe that what the [[Austrian school]] economists wrote was coming true on August 15, 1971, when President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon Shock|closed the "gold window"]] by implementing the [[U.S. dollar]]'s complete departure from the [[gold standard]].<ref name=gold/> That same day, the young physician decided to enter politics, saying later, "After that day, all money would be political money rather than money of real value. I was astounded."<ref name=no/>

===First campaigns===
Inspired by his belief that the monetary crisis of the 1970s was predicted by the [[Austrian School]] and caused by excessive government spending on the [[Vietnam War]]<ref>Caldwell, Christopher (June 22, 2007) [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?ei=5124&en=22ee37525a9fc4f5&ex=1343016000&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink&pagewanted=all "TheAntiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul"], ''New York Times''</ref> and  [[welfare state|welfare]],<ref name=lambda>{{cite news|url=http://www.crossandcrescent.com/2007/11/ron-pauls-presidential-bid/|title=Ron Paul's Presidential Bid|author=Barrick, Chris|date=November 2007|accessdate=2007-11-08|publisher=[[Lambda Chi Alpha]]|work=Cross and Crescent}}</ref> Paul became a delegate to the Texas Republican [[political convention|convention]] and a Republican candidate for the [[United States Congress]]. In 1974, incumbent [[Robert R. Casey]] defeated him in the [[TX-22|22nd district]]. When President [[Gerald Ford]] appointed Casey to head the [[Federal Maritime Commission]], Paul won an April 1976 [[special election]] to fill the empty seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070323/23paulfacts.htm |title=U.S. News & World Report.

Paul was the first Republican representative from the area; he also led the Texas Reagan delegation at the national Republican convention.<ref name=campaigncom>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgF-s1voM_Y|title=The Ron Paul Story|format=YouTube|accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> His successful campaign against Gammage surprised local Democrats, who had expected to retain the seat easily in the wake of the [[Watergate scandal]]. Gammage underestimated Paul's support among local mothers: "I had real difficulty down in Brazoria County, where he practiced, because he'd delivered half the babies in the county. There were only two obstetricians in the county, and the other one was his partner."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15016924|title=Paul Has Long Drawn Support from Unlikely Places|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2007-10-07|accessdate=2007-10-23|author=Goodwyn, Wade|work=the '08 Candidates' First Campaign}}</ref>

During his first term, Paul founded a [[think tank]], the [[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]] (FREE).<ref name=free>{{cite web|url=http://www.free-nefl.com/html/introduction.html|title=Introduction to FREE and NEFL|publisher=[[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]]|accessdate=2008-02-12}}</ref> Also in 1976, the foundation began publication of the first monthly newsletter connected with Paul, ''Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report''<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.tnr.com/downloads/freedomApril1978.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080216011757/http://www.tnr.com/downloads/freedomApril1978.pdf|archivedate=2008-02-16|journal=Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report|title=The absence of force and toleration of others is the key to peace and prosperity|date=April 1978|author=Paul, Ron, attrib.|publisher=[[Foundation for Rational Economics and Education]]|volume=3|issue=4|accessdate=2008-02-13|format=PDF (reprint)|oclc=15124395}}</ref> (or ''Special Report''). It also publishes [[monographs]], books, radio spots, and (since 1997) a new series of the monthly newsletter, ''Ron Paul's Freedom Report'', which promote the principles of limited government.

On the [[House Banking Committee]], Paul blamed the Federal Reserve for inflation,<ref name=2008bio/> and spoke against the banking mismanagement that led to the [[savings and loan crisis]].<ref name=ny/> The U.S. Gold Commission created by Congress in 1982 was his and [[Jesse Helms]]'s idea, and Paul's commission minority report was published by the [[Cato Institute]] in ''The Case for Gold'';<ref name=gold>{{cite web|work=J.

In 1984, Paul chose to run for the [[U.S. Senate]] instead of re-election to the House, but lost the Republican primary to [[Phil Gramm]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2007-07-26|author=Rudin, Ken|accessdate=2008-03-22|title=Ron Paul, George and Ringo|work=Political Junkie}}</ref> Another candidate in the senatorial primary was [[Henry Grover]], a conservative former state legislator who had lost the 1972 gubernatorial general election to the Democrat [[Dolph Briscoe|Dolph Briscoe, Jr.]] Paul then returned to full-time medical practice<ref name=2008bio/> and was succeeded by former state representative [[Tom DeLay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/legis/members/roster.cfm?leg=68|title=Members and leaders of the Texas Legislature|accessdate=2007-07-08|publisher=Legislative Reference Library of Texas}}</ref> In his House [[farewell address]], Paul said, "Special interests have replaced the concern that the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] had for general welfare. [[Vote trading]] is seen as good politics. The errand-boy mentality is ordinary, the defender of liberty is seen as bizarre. It's difficult for one who loves true liberty and utterly detests the power of the state to come to Washington for a period of time and not leave a true [[cynicism|cynic]]."<ref name=insight1997/>

In 2009, Paul was featured by [[CBS]] on ''[[Up to the Minute]]'' as one of two members of the U.S. Congress that have pledged not to receive pension from the [[United States government]]. The other is [[Howard Coble]] of [[North Carolina]].<ref>(December 22, 2009) [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/22/eveningnews/main6011719.shtml "CBS Up to the Minute: Pensions Follow Ex-Lawmakers to Prison"], CBS News.com Retrieved December 23, 2009.</ref>

According to Paul, his presidential run was about more than reaching office; he sought to spread his libertarian ideas, often to school and university groups regardless of vote eligibility.

===Campaigns===
{{details|Texas's 14th Congressional district}}

====1996 campaign====
In 1996, Paul was re-elected to Congress after the toughest campaign race he had faced since the 1970s. As Republicans had taken over both houses of Congress in the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 election]], Paul entered the race hopeful that his [[Constitutionalist]] policies of tax cuts, closing federal agencies, and curbing the U.N. would have broader support than in the past.<ref name=paulsneary>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3827/is_199806/ai_n8799789|title=Paul vs. Sneary|date=1998-06-26|accessdate=2007-11-18|work=[[Human Events]]}}</ref> The [[Republican National Committee]] focused instead on encouraging Democrats to switch parties, as Paul's primary opponent, incumbent [[Greg Laughlin]], had done in 1995. The party threw its full weight behind Laughlin, including support from House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], and the [[National Rifle Association]]. Paul responded by running newspaper ads quoting Gingrich's harsh criticisms of Laughlin's Democratic voting record 14&nbsp;months earlier.<ref name=campaign1996/> Paul won the primary with support from baseball pitcher, constituent, and friend [[Nolan Ryan]] (as honorary campaign chair and ad spokesman), as well as tax activist [[Steve Forbes]]<ref name=ny/> and conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] (both of whom had run presidential campaigns that year).

Paul's Democratic opponent in the fall general election, [[trial lawyer]] [[Charles "Lefty" Morris]], received assistance from the [[AFL-CIO]], but Paul's wider contributor base out-raised Morris two-to-one, giving the third-highest amount of individual contributions received by any House member (behind Gingrich and [[Bob Dornan]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/118086.html|title=Paul for President?|accessdate=2007-05-28|last=Doherty|first=Brian|date=2007-01-22|work=[[Reason magazine]]}}</ref> While Paul was able to paint Morris as a tool of [[trial lawyer]]s and [[big labor]], Morris ran numerous ads about Paul's advocacy of federal drug law repeal.

Morris also accused Paul of authoring questionable statements in past newsletters,<ref name=no/> some of which were characterized as racially charged.<ref>{{cite news|work=Campaign '96 U.S. House|title=Newsletter excerpts offer ammunition to Paul's opponent|author=Bernstein, Alan|url=http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070512114222/http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/aol-metropolitan/96/05/23/paul.html|archivedate=2007-05-12|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=1996-05-22|accessdate=2007-10-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Congressman Who Voted Against a Congressional Medal for Rosa Parks|journal=Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|volume=24|pages=38<U+2013>9|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=1077-3711(199922)24%3C38%3ATCWVAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K|date=October 1999|year=1999}}</ref> Paul's congressional campaign countered the statements were taken out of context.<ref name="Old News?">{{cite news |url=http://reason.com/blog/show/124339.html |publisher=[[Reason magazine|Reason]] |work=Hit & Run |title="Old News"?

Further, the campaign rejected Morris' demand to release all back issues.

Paul went on to win the election in a close margin. It became the third time Paul had been elected to Congress as a non-incumbent.<ref name=ny/> Upon his returning to Washington, Paul quickly discovered "there was no sincere effort" by Republicans toward their declared goal of [[small government]].<ref name=lambda/>

====Later campaigns====
In 1998 and again in 2000, Paul defeated Loy Sneary, a Democratic [[Bay City, Texas|Bay City]] rice farmer and former [[Matagorda County]] judge,<ref name=no/> running ads warning voters to be "leery of" Sneary.<ref name=saynot/> Paul accused Sneary of voting to raise his pay by 5%, increasing his travel allotment by 400% in one year, and using increased taxes to start a new government [[bureaucracy]] to handle a [[license plate]] fee he enacted. Sneary's aides said he had voted to raise all county employees' pay by five percent in a [[cost-of-living increase]]. Paul countered that he had never voted to raise Congressional pay.<ref name=paulsneary/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040805041451/http://www.chron.com/cgi-bin/auth/story.mpl/content/chronicle/metropolitan/98/08/15/notebook.2-0.html|archivedate=2004-08-05|title=Foes lock horns over Paul's radio ads|accessdate=2007-05-26|date=1998-08-14|work=Campaign Notebook|publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]|author=Bernstein, Alan}}</ref> In both campaigns, the national Democratic Party and major unions continued to spend heavily on targeting Paul.<ref name=no/>

An online [[grassroots]] petition to [[Political draft|draft]] Paul for the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] garnered several thousand signatures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:kzoMbojcmoAJ:www.petitiononline.com/mod_perl/signed.cgi%3FPaul2004|title=Ron Paul for President 2004|author=Allan, Sterling D|publisher=Petition Online}}</ref> On December 11, 2001, he told the independent movement that he was encouraged by the fact that the petition had spread the message of Constitutionalism, but did not expect a White House win at that time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paul2004.com/RonsResponse/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040722093715/http://www.paul2004.com/RonsResponse/index.html|archivedate=2004-07-22|title=Ron Paul's Response to "Ron Paul for President 2004" Petition|author=Allan, Sterling D.|publisher=Draft Ron Paul for United States President 2004|date=2001-12-11|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref> Further prompting in early 2007 led him to enter the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 race]].

===Relationship with district===
[[File:TX14 109.gif|thumb|300px|Paul represent's [[Texas's 14th congressional district]], which is larger than [[Massachusetts]].]]
After [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Paul's district is larger than [[Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite news|title=GOP House Candidate Responds to Charges|accessdate=2007-09-11|author=Pressley, Sue Ann|date=1996-05-26|work=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> with {{convert|675|mi|km}} of [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline between [[Houston]] and [[Rockport, Texas|Rockport]], Texas, covering some 22&nbsp;counties. Even so, Paul opposes programs like [[National Flood Insurance Program|federally funded flood insurance]] (typically supported by coastal and rural representatives) because it requires those outside flood zones to subsidize those within, but prohibits those within from choosing their own insurers. In an overwhelmingly rural region known for [[ranching]] and [[rice]] farms,<ref name=gold/> Paul opposes farm subsidies because they are paid to large corporations rather than small farmers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,252847,00.html|title=Ron Paul, the Real Republican?|authorlink=Radley Balko|last=Balko|first=Radley|date=2007-02-20|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=[[Fox News]]|work=Straight Talk}}</ref> Despite his voting against heavily supported legislation like [[farm bill]]s, Paul's devotion to reducing government resonates with 14th district voters:<ref name=no/> in a survey, 54% of his constituency agreed with his goal of eliminating the [[U.S. Department of Education]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst97/tst072097.htm|title=Parents must have control of education|accessdate=2007-09-13|author=Paul, Ron|date=1997-07-20|work=[[Congressional Record]]|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]| |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070903132227/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst97/tst072097.htm |archivedate = September 3, 2007}}</ref>

Paul adds his own [[earmark (politics)|earmarks]], such as for Texas shrimp promotion, but he routinely votes against most spending bills returned by committee.<ref name=will>{{cite news|title=A Cheerful Anachronism|url=http://www.libertypost.org/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=177422&Disp=41&Trace=on|authorlink=George Will|last=Will|first=George F|date=2007-02-18|accessdate=2008-03-17|work=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref><ref name=wsj2003>{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB104725224693862700.html|title=A Far-Right Texan Inspires Antiwar Left|accessdate=2007-06-15|author=Murray, Shailagh|date=2003-03-10|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref> Earmarks permit members of Congress, rather than [[executive branch]] [[civil servants]], to designate spending priorities<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/BG1527.cfm|title=Can Congress Be Embarrassed into Ending Wasteful Pork-Barrel Spending?|author=Utt, Ronald D., Ph.D., and Summers, Christopher B|date=2002-03-15|accessdate=2008-03-17|publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]]|work=Backgrounder}}</ref> for previously authorized funds directed otherwise.<ref name=wsj2003/> Paul compared his practice to objecting to the tax system yet taking all one's [[tax credit]]s: "I want to get their money back for the people."<ref>{{cite news|title=Ron Paul defends asking for special projects|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|work=Politics|date=2007-12-23|accessdate=2008-03-17|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22379734/}}</ref>
In ''[[The Revolution: A Manifesto]]'', Paul states his views on earmarks this way: "The real problem, and one that was unfortunately not addressed in the 2007's earmark dispute, is the size of the federal government and the amount of money we are spending in these appropriations bills. Cutting even a million dollars from an appropriations bill that spends hundreds of billions will make no appreciable difference in the size of government, which is doubtless why politicians and the media are so eager to have us waste our time on [earmarks]."<ref>{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Ron|year=2008|title=The Revolution: A Manifesto|pages=81<U+2013>82|isbn=0446537519}}</ref>

Paul also spends extra time in the district to compensate for "violat[ing] almost every rule of political survival you can think of,"<ref name=no/> traveling over {{convert|300|mi|km}} daily<ref name=no/> to attend civic ceremonies for veterans, graduates, and [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], often accompanied by his grandchildren. His staff helps senior citizens obtain free or low-cost prescription drugs through a little-known drug company program; procures lost or unreceived medals for war veterans, holding dozens of medal ceremonies annually; is known for its effectiveness in tracking down [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks; and sends out birthday and condolence cards.<ref name=no/><ref name=wsj2003/>

In 2001, he was one of only eight doctors in the House; even fewer had continued to practice while in office. He is occasionally approached by younger area residents to thank him for attending and assisting their deliveries at birth.<ref name=no/>

===Legislation===
Paul authors more bills than the average representative, such as those that impose [[term limits]], or abolish the income tax<ref name=endirs/> or the Federal Reserve; many do not escape committee review. He has written successful legislation to prevent [[eminent domain]] seizure of a church in New York, and a bill transferring ownership of the [[Lake Texana]] dam project from the federal government to Texas. By amending other legislation, he has barred funding for [[national identification numbers]], funding for federal teacher certification,<ref name=no/> [[International Criminal Court]] jurisdiction over the [[U.S. military]], American participation in any U.N. [[Tobin tax|global tax]], and surveillance on peaceful [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] activities by citizens.<ref>{{cite news|title=Paul says Americans' freedoms under siege|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1007/6277_Page2.html|author=Bresnahan, John|publisher=[[the Politico]]|date=2007-10-10|accessdate=2007-10-10}}</ref>

In March 2001, Paul introduced a bill to repeal the 1973 [[War Powers Resolution]] (WPR) and reinstate the process of formal declaration of war by Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22022|title=Bill would restore Congress' war powers|accessdate=2008-02-12|author=Dougherty, Jon|date=2001-03-13|work=[[WorldNetDaily]]}}</ref> Later in 2001, Paul voted to [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|authorize]] the president, pursuant to WPR, to respond to those responsible for the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Vote (How all members voted): Authorization for Use of Military Force|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_keyvote_member.php?cs_id=V3064|publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]]|accessdate=2007-10-23|date=2005-02-03}}</ref> He also introduced Sunlight Rule legislation, which requires lawmakers to take enough time to read bills before voting on them,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2007/tst091607.htm|title=The Sunlight Rule|accessdate=2007-09-27|author=Paul, Ron|date=2007-09-16|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]|work=[[Congressional Record]]| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930113524/http://www.house.gov/paul/tst/tst2007/tst091607.htm| archivedate = September 30, 2007}}</ref> after the [[Patriot Act]] was passed within 24&nbsp;hours of its introduction. Paul was one of six Republicans to vote against the [[Iraq War Resolution]], and (with [[Oregon]] representative [[Peter DeFazio]]) sponsored a resolution to repeal the war authorization in February 2003.

Paul has introduced several bills to apply tax credits toward education, including credits for parental spending on [[public education|public]], [[Private education#North America|private]], or [[homeschool]] students ([[Family Education Freedom Act]]); for salaries for all [[K<U+2013>12 education|K<U+2013>12]] teachers, librarians, counselors, and other school personnel; and for donations to scholarships or to benefit academics ([[Education Improvement Tax Cut Act]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationpolicy.org/newsletter/EEMar99.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164509/http://educationpolicy.org/newsletter/EEMar99.htm|archivedate=2007-10-11|title=Rep.

Paul was on a [[bipartisan]] coalition of 17&nbsp;members of Congress that sued President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1999 over his conduct of the [[Kosovo war]]. They accused Clinton of failing to inform Congress of the action's status within 48&nbsp;hours as required by the [[War Powers Resolution]], and of failing to obtain Congressional declaration of war. Congress had voted 427<U+2013>2 against a declaration of war with [[Yugoslavia]], and had voted to deny support for the air campaign in Kosovo. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that since Congress had voted for funding after Clinton had actively engaged troops in the war with Kosovo, legislators had sent a confusing message about whether they approved of the war. Paul said that the judge's decision attempted to circumvent the Constitution and to authorize the president to conduct a war without approval from Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm|title=Judge sides with Clinton|accessdate=2007-06-12|author=Paul, Ron|date=1999-06-09|publisher=[[U.S. House of Representatives]]| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610052445/http://www.house.gov/paul/press/press99/pr060999.htm| archivedate = June 10, 2007}}</ref>

Controversial claims made in Ron Paul's newsletters, written in the first person, included statements such as "Boy, it sure burns me to have a national holiday for that pro-communist philanderer Martin Luther King.

Additionally, Paul's campaign claimed through a press release that the quotations had come from an unnamed ghostwriter and without Paul's consent.

Jesse Benton, Senior VP of Campaign for Liberty, has said of the prospective run: "If the decision had to be made today, it would be 'no', but he is considering it very strongly and there is a decent likelihood that he will.
