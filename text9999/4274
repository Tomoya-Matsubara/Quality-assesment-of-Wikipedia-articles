The '''National Mall''' is an open-area [[List of areas in the United States National Park System|national park]] in [[Downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown]] [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of the [[United States]].  The National Mall is a unit of the [[National Park Service]], and is administered by the [[National Mall and Memorial Parks]] unit.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nacc/ National Mall & Memorial Parks - National Mall & Memorial Parks (U.S. National Park Service)]</ref>  The term "National Mall" commonly includes areas that are officially part of [[West Potomac Park]] and [[Constitution Gardens]] to the west, and often is taken to refer to the entire area between the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], with the [[Washington Monument]] providing a division slightly west of the center.  The National Mall receives approximately 24 million visitors each year.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/mall/faqs.htm U.S. National Park Service]</ref>

==History==
{{seealso|History of Washington, D.C.}}
[[Image:DC mall capitol.jpg|thumb|View from the [[United States Capitol]], facing west across the National Mall]]
The idea for the National Mall was originally conceived by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] in his plans for the city of Washington, D.C., created in 1791.  However, his ideas were not realized until the beginning of the 20th century, with the [[McMillan Commission]] plan, which was also inspired by the [[City Beautiful Movement]].  Among other things, the McMillan plan called for moving the main railroad station from a site on the National Mall to its present location at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]]. 

On October 15, 1966, the National Mall was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  In 2003, the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Reserve Act of 2003|Reserve Act]] to restrict further construction on the National Mall.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/31/AR2006103101426.html Park Service Seeks Ideas for a Mall Makeover, ''The Washington Post'']</ref>

The Capitol and surrounding grounds on the right were pixelated before release, presumably for security reasons.]]

The [[National Sylvan Theater]], southeast of the Washington Monument, is also part of the Mall, although it is not numbered on the above image.  As popularly understood, the National Mall also includes the following areas west of the Washington Monument: the Lincoln Memorial and [[Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool|Reflecting Pool]], the [[National World War II Memorial]], the [[Korean War Veterans Memorial]], the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]], and the [[District of Columbia War Memorial]].

The [[Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial]], scheduled for completion in 2009, will be located on a 4 acre (1.62 ha) site that borders the [[Tidal Basin (District of Columbia)|Tidal Basin]] and within the sightline of the [[Jefferson Memorial|Jefferson]] and Lincoln memorials.

The [[National Museum of African American History and Culture]] will be located at the southwest corner of [[Constitution Avenue]] and [[14th Street Northwest and Southwest (Washington, D.C.)|14th Street]], [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest]], adjacent to the [[National Museum of American History]].

==Usage of the National Mall==
The National Mall, in combination with the other attractions in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], makes the nation's capital city one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.  But it has uses other than as a tourist focal point.

===Protests and rallies===
[[File:View of Crowd at 1963 March on Washington.jpg|thumb|left|The 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on the National Mall]] 
{{seealso|List of protest marches on Washington, D.C.}}
The National Mall's status as a wide, open expanse at the heart of the capital makes it an attractive site for protests and rallies of all types.  One notable example is the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], a [[Demonstration (people)|political rally]] for [[African American]] [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|civil rights]], at which [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave his famous "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech.  

The largest officially recorded rally was the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam War Moratorium Rally]] on October 15, 1969.  Although larger rallies may have occurred since that time, the [[United States Park Police]] no longer releases official estimates of crowd sizes on the Mall.  One later rally that is claimed to have been the largest rally on the Mall was the 2004 [[March for Women's Lives]].  On January 27, 2007, tens of thousands of protesters [[Opposition to the Iraq War|opposed to the Iraq War]], [[January 27, 2007 anti-war protest|converged on the Mall]], drawing comparisons by participants to the [[Vietnam War]] protest.<ref>{{cite news | author = Ian Urbina | title = Wide opposition to war energizes protests / Washington: Jane Fonda among celebrity protesters joining veterans, politicians in calling for end to war | publisher = ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' | date = 2007-01-28 | url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/28/MNGASNQDO81.DTL | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Calvin Woodward and Larry Margasak | title = Crowds on Both Coasts Protest Iraq War | publisher = ''[[guardian.co.uk|Guardian Unlimited]]'' | date = 2007-01-28 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6376579,00.html | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Ian Urbina | title = Protest Focuses on Iraq Troop Increase | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]'' | date = 2007-01-28 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/washington/28protest.html?hp&ex=1170046800&en=defcbb536a8a2453&ei=5094&partner=homepage | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Deborah Charles | title = Tens of thousands demand U.S. get out of Iraq | publisher = ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' | date = 2007-01-28 | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/1/28/worldupdates/2007-01-28T093422Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_-285278-1&sec=Worldupdates | accessdate = 2007-01-28 }}</ref>

===Presidential inauguration===
[[File:Obama inaugural address.jpg|thumb|[[Inauguration of Barack Obama]] on January 20, 2009]]
{{main|United States presidential inauguration}}
During the [[United States presidential inauguration|presidential inauguration]], people without official tickets gather at the National Mall.  Normally, the Mall between [[7th Street (Washington, D.C.)|7th]] and 14th Streets, NW is used as a staging ground for the parade.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nikita |title=Entire Mall To Be Open To Public |curly=y |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/04/AR2008120403719.html?hpid=topnews |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 5, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref> 

On December 4, 2008, the Presidential Inaugural Committee announced that "for the first time, the entire length of the National Mall will be opened to the public so that more people than ever before will be able to witness the swearing-in of the [[President of the United States|President]] from a vantage point in sight of the Capitol."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pic2009.org/pressroom/entry/open_inauguration/ |title=National Mall Will Be Open to the Public on Inauguration Day |accessdate=6 December 2008 |date=December 4, 2008 |work=Presidential Inauguration Committee}}</ref>  This arrangement was made because of the massive turnout <U+2013> projected to be as many 2 million people <U+2013> expected for the [[inauguration of Barack Obama]].

===Recreation===
The National Mall has long served as a spot for jogging, picnics, and light recreation for the [[Demographics of Washington, D.C.|Washington population]].  It is also host to several annual events.  Every year on [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th]], ''[[A Capitol Fourth]]'' celebration takes place at the U.S. Capitol end of the Mall, with a [[fireworks]] display.  On Monday nights during July and August, the Mall hosts the annual [[Screen on the Green (Washington, D.C.)|Screen on the Green]] movie festival.  The free classic movies are projected on large portable screens and typically draw crowds of thousands of people.

On July 7, 2007, one leg of [[Live Earth concert, Washington, D.C.|Live Earth]] was held at the Mall.  Former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] presented, and artists such as [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Trisha Yearwood]] performed.

==Transportation==
