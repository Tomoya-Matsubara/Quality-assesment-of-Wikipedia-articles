==Biography==
The seventh of ten children, Jean-Marie Odin was born in [[Saint-Georges-Haute-Ville|Hauteville]], [[Ambierle]], to Jean and Claudine Marie (n<U+00E9>e Seyrol) Odin.<ref name=LHA>{{cite news|work=Louisiana Historical Association|title=ODIN, Jean-Marie|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site32.php}}</ref> He showed a strong inclination toward religion from an early age, and was sent at age 9 to study [[Latin]] under his uncle, the [[pastor]] of [[Noailly]], whose death soon ended this period of instruction.<ref name=catholic>{{cite news|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|title=John Mary Odin|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11208a.htm}}</ref> After two years at home, he studied the [[classics]] at [[Roanne]] and [[Verri<U+00E8>res-en-Forez|Verri<U+00E8>res]] before beginning his studies in [[philosophy]] at [[Sainte-Foy-l'Argenti<U+00E8>re|L'Argenti<U+00E8>re]] and [[Alix, Rh<U+00F4>ne|Alix]].<ref name=catholic/> Odin, while attending the [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|Sulpician]] [[seminary]] in [[Lyon]], accepted an appeal from Bishop [[Louis William Valentine Dubourg|Louis Dubourg]] in 1822 to join the [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in [[Louisiana]], [[United States]].<ref name=catholic/>

After arriving in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] in July 1822, he was sent to complete his [[Theology|theological]] studies at St. Mary's of the Barrens Seminary in [[Perryville, Missouri|Perryville]], [[Missouri]], on the outskirts of [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].<ref name=TSHA>{{cite news|work=Texas State Historical Association|title=ODIN, JEAN MARIE (1800-1870)|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/OO/fod2.html}}</ref> He entered the [[Congregation of the Mission]] (also known as the Lazarists or Vincentians) on November 8, 1822,<ref name=LHA/> and was later [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] by Bishop Dubourg on May 4, 1823.<ref name=hierarchy>{{cite news|work=Catholic-Hierarchy.org|title=Archbishop Jean Marie (John Mary) Odin, C.M.|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bodin.html}}</ref> Odin then did [[missionary]] work in [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]] and among the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] along the [[Arkansas River]], also serving as a [[professor]] and later [[University president|president]] of St. Mary's Seminary.<ref name=clarke>{{cite news|work=Lives of the Deceased Bishops of the Catholic Church in the United States|last=Clarke|first=Richard Henry}}</ref> He accompanied Bishop [[Joseph Rosati]] to the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|Second Provincial Council of Baltimore]] in 1833 as theologian, and briefly served as pastor of [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri|Cape Girardeau]], where he opened a [[Catholic school|school]] in 1838.<ref name=clarke/> <ref name=catholic/>

The [[Holy See]] established the [[Apostolic prefect|Apostolic Prefecture]] of [[Texas]] on October 24, 1839, with Odin assigned as Vice-[[Apostolic prefect|Prefect Apostolic]] under Rev. [[John Timon]].<ref name=TSHA/> He there labored among Catholics, many of whom had fallen away amid the disorders accompanying the [[Texas Revolution|change of government]], as well as non-Catholics and Native Americans.<ref name=catholic/> He was later named [[Coadjutor Bishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit|Detroit]], [[Michigan]] in December 1840, but declined the appointment in May 1841.<ref name=LHA/> Two months later, however, Odin was appointed the first [[Apostolic vicariate|Vicar Apostolic]] of Texas and [[Titular Bishop]] of ''[[Claudiopolis (Cilicia)|Claudiopolis in Isauria]]'' by [[Pope Gregory XVI]] on July 16, 1841.<ref name=hierarchy/> He received his [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|episcopal consecration]] on March 6, 1842 from Bishop [[Antoine Blanc]], with Bishops [[Michael Portier]] and [[John J. Chanche]], [[Society of Saint-Sulpice|P.S.S.]], serving as [[Consecrator|co-consecrators]], at New Orleans.<ref name=hierarchy/>

During his tenure, the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas|Texan Congress]] returned several of the ancient churches to their original uses, schools were opened, and the [[Ursulines|Ursuline]] [[nuns]] (the first [[Consecrated life (Catholic Church)|religious community]] in Texas) were introduced to care for them.<ref name=galveston>{{cite news|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|title=Galveston|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06372a.htm}}</ref> On May 21, 1847, Odin was named the first [[Ordinary|Bishop]] of the newly-erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston|Diocese of Galveston]], which encompassed the entire state of Texas.<ref name=hierarchy/> He secured the services of communities of the [[Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word|Sisters of the Incarnate Word]], [[Marist Brothers|Brothers of Mary]], and [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblates of Mary]], to whom he gave charge of St. Mary's University at Galveston (which he established in 1854).<ref name=galveston/> He also completed arduous visitations into the more remote parts of Texas, and twice visited [[Europe]] to secure priests and material help for the diocese.<ref name=clarke/> By the end of his tenure, he had increased the number of priests to 84 and the number of churches to 50; for his many efforts he has been called the father of the modern Catholic Church in Texas.<ref name=TSHA/>

Following the death of Archbishop Blanc in June 1860, Odin was appointed the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans|Archbishop of New Orleans]] on February 15, 1861.<ref name=hierarchy/> He arrived in New Orleans soon after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861-1865), which largely defined his tenure.<ref name=history>{{cite news|work=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans]]|title=A History of the Archdiocese of New Orleans: The Civil War Years (1861-1865)|url=http://archdiocese-no.org/history/civilwar.htm}}</ref> Like other [[Southern United States|Southern]] bishops and the great majority of his clergy, Odin supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cause, worked to alleviate the suffering caused by the war, and spoke out continually of the need for peace.<ref name=history/> He was one of [[Pope Pius IX]]'s main contacts in his unsuccessful attempts to bring about peace.<ref name=history/> <ref name=LHA/> More than a half dozen of [[Louisiana]]'s clergy served as Confederate [[chaplain]]s throughout the South, and numerous nuns and laywomen served in [[hospital]]s assisting war victims; the [[Daughters of Charity]] not only continued their work at [[Charity Hospital (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Charity Hospital]] in New Orleans, but also volunteered for city and battlefield hospitals in [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Virginia]].<ref name=history/> Following the war, he made serious efforts to secure adequate ministration and education to [[Freedman|freed]] [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], but was largely unsuccessful.<ref name=LHA/> He was also forced to close the diocesan [[seminary]] in 1867 due to lack of funds resulting from the war.<ref name=orleans>{{cite news|cite news=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|title=New Orleans|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11005b.htm}}</ref>

Outside of the war, Odin issued financial regulations for the debt-laden archdiocese in January 1863 to save it from [[bankruptcy]]; these regulations initially met with opposition.<ref name=orleans/> The archdiocese was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on August 15, 1866 as "The Roman Catholic Church of the Diocese of New Orleans," and the diocesan [[newspaper]], ''The Morning Star'', was founded in February 1868.<ref name=orleans/> He appealed for priests from Europe and, in early 1863, forty seminarians and five Ursulines arrived; during the nine years of his administration, he nearly doubled the number of his clergy and churches.<ref name=orleans/> Odin attended the [[First Vatican Council]] in 1869 but, suffering from [[neuralgia]], was forced to leave early due to poor health.<ref name=clarke/> He returned to his native Hauteville, where he soon died at age 70.<ref name=clarke/>
