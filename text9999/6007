'''Cars of Mexico''' refers to the creation of [[automobile]] marketing, as well as a comprehensive list of every car currently sold with a short description of the car's manufacturer history in the country.

==Mexican automotive history==
===Early years (1903 - 1960)===
In 1903, motorcars first arrived in [[Mexico City]], totalling 136 in that year and rising to 800 by 1906. This encouraged then president [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]], to create both the first [[highway code]] for the country (which would allow cars to move at a maximum speed of 10&nbsp;km/h or 6&nbsp;mph on crowded or small streets and 40&nbsp;km/h or 25&nbsp;mph elsewhere) and, along with this, a tax for car owners which would be abolished in 1911 with [[Francisco I. Madero|Madero's]] victory over D<U+00ED>az (see also [[Mexican Revolution]]).
In 1921, [[Buick]] became the first automobile producer to be officially established in Mexico. Four years later in 1925, [[Ford Motor Company]] was established, which remains the current longest-running brand after 83 years.

In 1959, the first ever Mexican automobile was produced. The Rural Ramirez, truck in SUV and pickup truck format. Made by Grupo Industrial Ramirez.

===Decline (1961 - 1993)===
Many car makers were already operational by 1961 when the first decline of the Mexican economy showed up. In the early 1960s, government regulations forced car companies to assemble cars in Mexico, using local as well as imported components. The idea was to develop a national car industry in the country, to promote employment and technological advances. Those companies that would not comply with these regulations left the country; these included [[Mercedes Benz]], [[Fiat|FIAT]], [[Citro<U+00EB>n]], [[Peugeot]] and [[Volvo]]. The American Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]]) remained along with [[American Motors]], [[Renault]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Datsun]] and [[Borgward]].

In this same year, and due to the announcement of the upcoming [[1968 Summer Olympics]] to be held in Mexico, the government reissued the tax on owning a car in order to "afford" the construction of new facilities for the Olympics; this was called the Tenencia (from the verb ''tener''; "to have" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]). However, the tax remained to finance the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], held also in Mexico. Ironically, the tax remains today. Although an irregularity within the [[Mexican Constitution]] was found in 2003 (and possible extension of payment by people who alleged that), this was fixed by modifying an article of the ''Carta Magna'' in May 2005, thus, legalizing the tax.
This tax is variable depending of the car's value, number of cylinders,transmission,Aircon or other features, reaching payment of up to 10% of the car's total value.
Taxing does not end there,there is another tax to pay if purchasing a new vehicle called ISAN "Impuesto Sobre Auto Nuevo" ("Tax On New Car"), also depending on vehicle's specs and price,as in the "Tenencia" tax, this tax is paid one time only. Federal law requires all listed car prices on media or dealerships to have the standard 15%tax and ISAN included on the listed price,making listed prices total on car and taxes.
Since many Mexican drivers default on paying this tax, government started taking countermeasures but due to this being perceived as uncontrollable, candidates to the presidency started making proposals to quit this tax before the July 2, 2006 elections including [[Felipe Calder<U+00F3>n]], current president of Mexico who took the charge on December 1. ''Tenencia'' remains to date though it is still due to be abolished by 2012 on Federal level, leaving the States the choice to charge or not the Tax on a State level.  As of 2010, only the State of [[Quer<U+00E9>taro]] announced that the tax would be abolished in 2012.

===Rebirth (1994 - 2006)===
The growth of [[Economy of Mexico|Mexico's economy]] during the late 90s stimulated car sales in Mexico and, eventually, most of the retired car makers established again in the country. Makers such as [[Honda]] and [[Porsche]] arrived for the first time during the last years of the 20th Century, and others such as [[Peugeot]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] gave Mexico a "second chance", both reestablishing in 1997.

{{col-end}}

Annual passenger vehicle sales in Mexico crossed the 1 million mark in 2005. Then increasing number of sales encouraged car makers to offer cars with alternative fuels like the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Volkswagen Jetta TDI. Such type of cars had't been available in Mexico since the first Volkswagen Caribe Diesel in late 70's and early 80's (see paragraphs for each makers: Honda and Volkswagen); however, still few cars have released their diesel-powered versions for the Mexican consumer due to stricter government emission laws than those of the European Union Euro IV, in order to maintain a petrol car market ONLY, so drivers cannot benefit from saving money on fuel. Diesel Cars do not apply for the privilege of driving every day in Mexico City,brand new Diesel vehicles enter the "Hoy no Circula" restrictions. Government officials claim Diesel powered vehicles are more pollutant than their petrol counterparts because they produce a bit of smoke, although modern Diesel engine technology has proven to be more reliable in fuel consumption and lower Co2 emissions than petrol. Diesel engines have a 50% energy efficiency compared to 23% on the most advanced petrol engines, fuel economy on a 2.0L Diesel engine can go up to 30&nbsp;km/L, compared to a 2.0L Petrol engine averaging 16&nbsp;km/L.

===The first product (2007 - present)===
{{Main|Mastretta MXT}}
[[Mastretta]] (est. 1989) first announced production of their [[Mastretta MXT|MXT]] through ''[[Autom<U+00F3>vil Panamericano]]'' magazine in May 2007. Even though up to a year will have passed, September 2008 will see the production version of the first ever fully Mexican designed and engineered serial-produced sports car, the [[Mastretta MXT]], an automobile built in a similar way of those of [[England|English]] [[Lotus Cars]], being their [[Lotus Elise|Elise]] its main target.
To date, 42 makers have official representation in the country with nearly 400 different models, making Mexico one of the most varied and fulfilled automotive markets in the world. While [[Lancia]] and [[Lexus]] are due to arrive in 2009, the only missing "mainstream" makers, [[Citro<U+00EB>n]] and [[Kia Motors|Kia]], have given no official advice, although the latter has commented so in the past.

==Vehicle use restrictions==
In Mexico City the "Hoy no circula" ("Today you can't drive") program is implemented. Every vehicle has a color sticker depending on the ending number of its plate, as well as a number to determine its pollution rate. Brand new cars "00" and recent models "0" are exempt; "Hoy no circula" only applies to vehicles older than 8 years, which have "1" and "2" designations.
The program works by removing these vehicles from circulation one day during the week, and recently one Saturday per month, depending on their last license plate digit number.
Said limitations occur as follows:
* Plates ending with 5 or 6 (<span style="color:yellow;">yellow</span>) cannot be driven on Mondays and the 1st Saturday of the current month.
* Plates ending with 7 or 8 (<span style="color:magenta;">pink</span>) cannot be driven on Tuesdays and the 2nd Saturday of the current month.
* Plates ending with 3 or 4 (<span style="color:red;">red</span>) cannot be driven on Wednesdays and the 3rd Saturday of the current month.
* Plates ending with 1 or 2 (<span style="color:green;">green</span>) cannot be driven on Thursdays and the 4th Saturday of the current month.
* Plates ending with 9 or 0 (<span style="color:blue;">blue</span>) cannot be driven on Fridays and the 5th Saturday (if any) of the current month.
For example, a fictional 1985 Volkswagen Golf with 903-NRX plates won't be allowed to be driven on Wednesdays 18 September 2010, nor 16 October 2010, etc.
The newer weekends restrictions have received criticism. Only a few months a year have five Saturdays, and so the blue-stickered cars will be removed only four or five weekends a year from circulation, while the rest of the cars will be weekend-banned once every month.

==Automotive culture and Mexico Autoshow==
{{Main|Sal<U+00F3>n Internacional del Autom<U+00F3>vil M<U+00E9>xico}}<br>
Since the first "Autoexpo del Autom<U+00F3>vil" the automotive culture in Mexico started growing in the Mexicans. The publication of the first Mexican auto magazines was in November 1981, [[Motor y Volante magazine]], in early 1995 [[4 Ruedas Magazine]] and shortly after [[Autom<U+00F3>vil Panamericano]] edited by [[Televisa]] encouraged it also.
The Autoexpo changed denomination in 2004 into the "Sal<U+00F3>n Internacional del Automovil" to convert into an international size event. It is in fact an event comparable to the [[North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]]. In the first two editions of the Mexico Autoshow brands new to Mexico, like [[Cars in Mexico#Mazda|Mazda]], were introduced. On the other hand, some manufacturers like [[Cars in Mexico#Jaguar|Jaguar]] and [[Cars in Mexico#Volvo|Volvo]] have been to neither the 2004 nor the 2005 editions. On the other hand, [[Cars in Mexico#Renault|Renault]] would attend every two years. However, the 2006 edition of the autoshow was considered a failure and a fraud since over 15 carmakers missed the event, including Volkswagen Group, Renault and Peugeot.
After the 2006 edition and for the first time since 1994, SIAM wasn't hosted in 2007, but it was stated that the 2008 edition is to be held by September, making a two-year event such as the [[Sao Paolo]] one.

==Successful cars in Mexico==
Some cars have been especially successful in Mexico, depending on their cost and viability.

===[[Opel Corsa]]===
{{Main|Opel Corsa}}<br>
[[File:Chevy C2 4P.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A couple of Chevys saloon in Mexico City]]
The second generation Opel Corsa was first introduced in Mexico in 1994 imported from Spain as a response to the successful [[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen Sed<U+00E1>n]], under the name "Chevrolet Chevy". General Motors used a practical, supermini with an affordable price tag for the Mexican consumer that gave excellent results. From 1996, when the Chevy Popular, or '''Chevy Pop''' Budget trim was introduced, and the Chevy began to be produced in the Ramos Arizpe GM assembly plant, replaced the '''Volkswagen Sedan''' (Beetle) as the top selling car in Mexico. Chevrolet soon launched the also Mexican made '''Chevy Monza''', similar to the 4 door saloon version of the '''Chevrolet Classic''' still produced in [[Brazil]], for those who wanted a bigger trunk and more room with for the same low price.

[[File:DSC01073a.jpg.JPG|250px|right|thumb|A 2006 Corsa saloon made in Brazil]]

The design was not changed until 2000, when it was facelifted in Europe with transparent headlights, newer rear lights and new interior. A [[station wagon]] imported from Argentina was also launched, as well as a Brazilian-made Pick Up variant. With the introduction of the [[Opel Corsa|Corsa III]], however, the older Corsa was no longer manufactured in European GM plants. This generation Corsa was remaining in production in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. In 2004, Mexican designers redesigned the '''Chevy''' inside and outside and upgraded the 1.6 liter engine to reach 98&nbsp;bhp. This newer Chevrolet was called C2 as a reference to the [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette generations]]. In July 2008, a new facelift made in Detroit makes its debut into the new 2009 Chevy, available in 3 and 5 door hatchback, and 4 door sedan bodies.

===[[Nissan Sentra|Nissan Tsuru]]===
{{Main|Nissan Sentra}}<br>
[[File:Nissan Sentra 2.0S -- 08-11-2010.jpg|250px|right|thumb|2010 Nissan Tsuru]]
The Datsun 160J was a mid-size saloon that sold well but did not meet the sales number benchmark set by its successor.
In 1984 the first [[Nissan Sentra]] was launched as a replacement of the 160J under the name "Tsuru", [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for [[Crane (bird)|crane]]. While the Tsuru was quickly accepted by Mexicans as a comfortable and affordable choice of car, it did not replace the VW Sed<U+00E1>n as the top-selling car in Mexico.

A second generation Tsuru was launched in 1989, with a more square-shaped and larger design. Neither generations, however, managed to replace to become the best selling car in Mexico.

The third generation Tsuru (the Sentra III) was introduced in 1992. This Tsuru featured a more rounded 1990s type design scheme. Soon the third generation Tsuru came to be known as powerful and comfortable, yet affordable.
With the Chevrolet Corsa in 1994, however, the Tsuru had a new rival. It didn't take so long for it to overpass the Chevy, and soon the Sed<U+00E1>n. It reached the top at number 1 in 1998 and it didn't missed until 2005, with the VW Pointer.
The Nissan Platina was thought to be its successor, but the incredible sales ranking of the Tsuru kept the Platina as another option. The Renault-based Platina remains to date on the top 10.

Tsuru are the most popular choice for city [[Taxicabs of Mexico|taxis in Mexico]] (Airport and hotel taxis usually consist of higher end vehicles) and the MkIII it's the current longest-running sold car in the country (18 years).

===[[Volkswagen Jetta]] (Volkswagen Cl<U+00E1>sico from 2010 onwards)===
{{Main|Volkswagen Jetta}}<br>
[[File:2011volkswagenjetta.JPG|250px|right|thumb|2010 Volkswagen Jetta Europa]]
[[File:PueblaAssembly.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Volkswagen Jetta factory in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]].]]
The first Jetta was renamed Atlantic in Mexican territory. It had good sales so Volkswagen decided start manufacturing this car in their factory at [[Puebla]], Mexico.
In late 1998 the fourth generation Jetta (called Bora in Europe) reached Mexico. The car presented a new design which didn't appeal initially to Mexicans. However, good marketing tactics and phrases like "No cambies, evoluciona" (Don't change, evolve) made Mexico change quickly its opinion and for the first time, a mid-sized vehicle reaching the Mexican top selling 10; the Jetta converted into a hit, reaching Mexico's top four best-seller. The catch phrase "Todo mundo tiene un Jetta, al menos en la cabeza" (Everyone has a Jetta, at least in their mind) came reality at such point it's common to see many Jettas driving nearby in the street.
The car's success was such that it couldn't be replaced in 2005 by the Jetta V, which adopted the Bora moniker so the Jetta IV continued on sale. Both cars achieved even greater success in their later years: Jetta IV placed number one for a month on June 2009, and Bora has kept among the top five since 2008.
A redesigned Jetta was released in 2009, and placed a new slogan "Porque el coraz<U+00F3>n no da explicaciones" (For the heart gives no reasons).

On July 22, 2010, the sixth generation Jetta was released. As of August 2010, Mexico is the only country in the world where fourth, fifth and sixth generation Jettas are being sold at the same time. Bora is expected to leave dealerships by 2011, but Jetta IV may be still offered afterwards due to its high sales. Incidently, Volkswagen changed this version's moniker to simply Cl<U+00E1>sico (Spanish for "classic"). The now Volkswagen Cl<U+00E1>sico is expected to continue on sale for at least 2013.

===[[Volkswagen Beetle|Volkswagen Sed<U+00E1>n]]===
[[File:Volkswagen Sed<U+00E1>n.jpg|250px|thumb|A Volkswagen Sed<U+00E1>n.]]
{{Main|Volkswagen Beetle}}{{Main|Volkswagen Beetle in Mexico}}<br>
The first Volkswagen car sold in Mexico was the 1954 Beetle, called Sed<U+00E1>n in this country. The popularity of the Beetle made VW to build its own factory in the state of [[Puebla]], Mexico.
In the early 80s, Mexico and Brazil were the only countries producing the Beetle (Sed<U+00E1>n in Mexico, Fusca in Brazil), so many foreigner enthusiasts used to import the car and keep it as a collection object.
Brazil stopped producing the Fusca in 1997, and Mexico became the sole producer.
The Sed<U+00E1>n was until 1999 the cheapest car in the Mexican territory, with a price of $47,000 MX pesos in 1996. Reasons for the success of this car were the price, quality and trust.

The last VW Sed<U+00E1>n magazine ad read ''Hab<U+00ED>a una vez... Fin.'' (Once upon a time... The end), featuring a split photo of the 1954 model and the 2003 one.

Volkswagen broadcasted a minute-length farewell TV ad with people waving goodbye to the Sed<U+00E1>n as it made its way through the avenue.

On July 30, 2003 the last Beetle came out from the Puebla factory closing a chapter in the automobile history. The 3000th last edition Sed<U+00E1>n (with a final price of $84,000 MX pesos) was given to Pope [[John Paul II]] and now resides in the Volkswagen museum in [[Germany]].

==Companies with official representation brands in Mexico==
This is a brief history of the car makers in this country.

===[[BMW|Bayerische Motoren Werke AG]]===
[[File:Protective service 01.jpg|thumb|Mexican built high security 760-Li in service with the [[Federal District Police|Mexican Federal District Police]].]]
:''Brands [[BMW]] and [[MINI]].''
BMW has manufacuturing facilities in [[Toluca]], and [[Mexico City]] which produce the [[BMW 3 Series|3 series]], [[BMW 5 Series|5 series]], [[BMW 6 Series|6 series]], [[BMW 7 Series|7 series]], and [[BMW X1|X1]], [[BMW X3 (E83)|X3]], [[BMW X5|X5]].

===[[Chrysler|Chrysler Group, LLC]]===
:''Brands [[Chrysler]], [[Dodge]] and [[Jeep]]; and vehicles by [[Hyundai]].''
[[Chrysler]] entered Mexico around 1937. In the 60s the company was renamed as [[Automex]] and the in the 70s to Chrysler de M<U+00E9>xico. The latest models are launched just after the [[United States]].
It sells several brands as [[Dodge]], [[Chrysler]], [[Jeep]], [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]], [[Maybach]], [[Mitsubishi]] (in partnership) and [[Hyundai]] under a "by Dodge" badge.
Hyundai has no official representation in Mexico so Hyundai cars are sold under Dodge's badge. Strangely enough, the Dodge [[Ramcharger]] 2-door SUV was popular in the Mexican market. Chrysler even developed a version of the Ramcharger based on the 1994 [[Ram]] not offered in the US due to the popularity of 2-door SUV's in Mexico, and the lack of market in the US.

For many years, Dodge vehicles were sometimes rebadged as Chryslers.

===[[First Automobile Works]]===
:''Brands [[FAW]].''
[[File:FAW Vita front - 2008 Montevideo Motor Show.jpg|thumb|Despite offering the cheapest vehicles in Mexico FAW has seen extremely poor sales amounting to less than 23,000 nationwide as of 2010.]]
The first Chinese car maker in [[Mexico]] was introduced in January 2008 through the convenience stores [[Grupo Elektra|Elektra]], owned by [[Grupo Salinas]]. Though the F1 is the cheapest automobile in the country, FAW has been achieving really poor sales in comparison with popular brands such as GM, Volkswagen and Nissan. While some have dismissed FAW due to its origin and the main purpose of economy, some have supported the maker by showing videos recorded during the [[EuroNCAP]] tests for the F5. However, the F5 is the one FAW's model that offers airbags in the country. Its current slogan is "''impulsa tus sue<U+00F1>os''" (impulse your dreams) as a reference for people unable to afford an expensive car.

===[[Fiat|Fiat S.p.A.]]===
:''Brands [[Ferrari]], [[Fiat]] and [[Maserati]].''
Fiat reentered Mexico in 2004 with collaboration of General Motors, before its commercial rupture. Fiat hadn't achieved a good rank of sales due of having one single model until the beginning of 2006. The Punto's introduction meant a hit for the maker.

Ferrari entered the country in 1998 with the F355 Spider. The Enzo Ferrari, arrived in early 2004 to the former dealership at Avenida de los Insurgentes (now Alfa Romeo's) in Mexico City and costing $1,285,000 US dollars. Five units were sold. Furthermore, Ferrari chose Chiapas to test its F430 in 2004 before it came out. Curiosly, is the only maker to offer its entire catalogue in Mexico.

===[[Ford Motor Company]]===
:''Brands [[List of Ford vehicles|Ford]], [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]], [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] and [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]].''
Ford Motor Company M<U+00E9>xico had great sales during the 50s, 60s and 70s, before being overtaken by General Motors. It used to hold the second place in sales. For several decades, Ford sold various successful Mercury models under a Ford badge, most notoriously the Mercury Zephyr as the Ford Elite II (with a [[Ford Granada (North America)#1981<U+2013>82|Ford Granada]] front end), [[Mercury Grand Marquis|Grand Marquis]], [[Mercury Cougar|Cougar]], Topaz (an upmarket [[Ford Tempo]]) and Ghia (an upmarket [[Mercury Topaz]]). Last example became the [[Mercury Sable]] rebadged as the [[Ford Taurus]].

From 1996, [[Lincoln (automobile)|Lincoln]] dealerships became Lincoln-Mercury dealerships selling both brands.

For a time, the hot hatch Focus ST was the only hatchback Focus available there. It offers a 2.5i 5-cylinder engine, as with [[Ford Focus (International)#Mk 2 (2004 - Present)|European]] versions, being Mexico the only country in America in which Ford offers this European version which is imported from Germany. Family versions were released with 2 trim levels and a 2.0i petrol engine.
This is not the same as the Focus sold in [[United States]], which is based on the 1998-2005 original version.

The European [[Ford Mondeo]] appeared in 2003, although it was different to the mainland Europe version; being more luxurious, it sold for approximately <U+00A3>20,000 for a 2.0i model.

Their successful Ikon (sedan version of the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta II]]) remained as a favorite for low income families, sharing a similar success with the next generation in 2005, the [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta III Sedan]]. However, it is the Brazilian mini SUV [[Ford Ecosport|Ecosport]] which now holds the Ford's best seller title.
The latest [[Ford Mustang|Mustang]] remains a favourite between men in their 20s and 30s, as its previous generations did.

In 2010, the [[Ford Taurus|Taurus]] badge is to return to Mexico after a 12-year absence.

===[[Fuji Heavy Industries|Fuji Heavy Industries Group]]===
:''Brands [[Subaru]].''

===[[General Motors|General Motors Company]]===
:''Brands [[Cadillac]], [[Chevrolet]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Hummer]], [[Pontiac]] and [[Saab]] and vehicles by [[Daewoo]], [[Opel]] and [[Saturn]].''
[[General Motors]] was the sales leader in Mexico until 2009, when Nissan overtook GM, becoming the new sales leader in Mexico<ref name="elsemanario.com.mx">{{cite web|author=elsemanario.com.mx |url=http://www.elsemanario.com.mx/news/news_display.php?story_id=30807 |title=Nissan arrebata trono a GM en M<U+00E9>xico durante 2009, El Semanario |publisher=Elsemanario.com.mx |date= |accessdate=2010-11-28}}</ref>. From the early 60s to early 90s [[Chevrolet]] was the only brand available, even in the 90s when GM sold Buicks and Oldsmobiles under the Chevrolet brand (e.g. the [[Buick Century]] as the Chevrolet Century Limited and the [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera]] as the Chevrolet Cutlass and Chevrolet Eurosport). The second formal brand to re-enter the market was Cadillac in 1991, and several other brands throughout the decade.

GM sells several brands like [[Chevrolet]], [[Cadillac]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], [[Saab]], [[Pontiac]], etc., and [[Daewoo]] and [[Opel]] under the [[Chevrolet]] brand name. The success of the [[Opel Corsa|Chevrolet Chevy]] (C2 redesigned in Mexico) kept this maker at the top 1 from 1995 until 2009<ref name="elsemanario.com.mx"/>.
Chevrolet was the one of the first carmakers to establish in [[Mexico]]. Previously all [[Buick]], [[Oldsmobile]] and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] vehicles were marketed as Chevrolet.

GM introduced the previous Daewoo Matiz to Mexico under the name Pontiac Matiz, but now the newest Matiz is sold under the Chevrolet logo in Europe. With the G3 and Aveo, GM became the same brand to offer exactly the same car model in Mexico in such a fashion as Saturn does in the United States.

The [[Hummer H1]] was available for the Mexican Army through the 90s.  With the late 2007 scandal involving former president [[Vicente Fox]] (portraying him as the owner of diverse vehicles from unknown funds, notably a Hummer), jokes referring to the Hummer became popular throughout the country.
After the [[Pontiac]] brand stops production of all cars in late 2010 as [[General Motors|GM]] announced , [[Buick]] is expected to replace [[Pontiac]] in the Mexican market and become the partner brand together with [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as most dealerships in Mexico are [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]-[[Pontiac]].

Saab has a reputation similar to Volvo's. Both brands are respected for their safety concept and Swedish design. They left in 2010 due to [[Spyker]] buying out the firm.

First Opel car in Mexico was the [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]] in the 60s. The maker was retired from the country from 1972 until 1994, when GM introduced the Opel Corsa and changed the denomination to Chevrolet Chevy.
The [[Cadillac Catera|Catera]] became a successful model in Mexico during the 90's. Nowadays the Escalade is the top selling of the maker.

===[[Honda|Honda Motor Company, Ltd.]]===
:''Brands [[Acura]] and [[Honda]].''

===[[Isuzu|Isuzu Motors, Ltd.]]===
Isuzu Motors de M<U+00E9>xico started operations in November 2005, thanks to the [[Economic Partnership Agreement]] that had been signed by Mexico and Japan. Isuzu is the first Japanese [[commercial vehicle]] manufacturer to enter Mexico, and it's a Joint Venture between [[Isuzu]] Motors Limited (51%) and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] (49%). The company started sales with the [[Isuzu Elf|ELF]] in 3 different versions: ELF 300 with payload capacity of 3.4ton, ELF 400 for 4 ton payload and ELF 450 for 4.5 ton. Since then the brand has expand throughout the country, as of 2008 has 27 dealers and will start assembly operations of the model ELF 600 in 2009. <!-- [http://www.isuzumex.com] -->

GM Mexico sold Isuzu pick-up truck as Chevrolet Luv imported from Chile (GM Chile). Single Cab and Crew Cab 4x2, 2.3 cc Petrol. The sirst South American compact truck (before Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux from Argentina).

===[[Jaguar Land Rover]]===
:''Brands [[Jaguar]] and [[Land Rover]].''
The X-Type is the most successful Jaguar in the country with a price range of US$40,000. Very few Jaguars are sold per year however (less than 1000).
The SUV maker Land Rover is very popular between the middle and high class in Mexico. The LR3 and the Freelander are the most successful models.

===[[Mazda Motor Corporation]]===
Mazda was introduced in Mexico in November 2005 with the aid of the [[Mazda3]] and [[Mazda6]] then current generations.

While it was common to spot illegal [[Mazda B-Series|B2000]] pick-ups and [[Mazda 626|626]] sedans on the streets, Mazda vehicles were virtually unknown in Mexico. This led to an unexpected sales range when the Mazda3 was introduced; both hatchback and notchback versions became a success among youngsters.

Throughout 2007 and 2008, Mazda fulfilled most of its clients' requests by presenting the MPV [[Mazda5]], the SUVs [[Mazda CX-7|CX-7]] and [[Mazda CX-9|CX-9]], and the popular roadster Miata, rebadged [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5]]. Though coup<U+00E9> [[Mazda RX-8|RX-8]] had been also considerated, the modifications needed to achieve good performance in the Valley of Mexico led the idea to be dropped. The only RX-8 delivered by Mazda Motor de M<U+00E9>xico to an individual was raffled by Mazda itself in 2008.

The new generation Mazda3 and the CX-7 have kept Mazda among the most successful brands in Mexico; Mazda6 and MX-5 maintain regular sales, while Mazda5 and CX-9 have the weakest.

===[[Mitsubishi Motors]]===
Mitsubishi entered Mexico in 2003 with the previous Galant and Montero. Mitsubishi has had success with the SUV's Endeavor and Outlander, and, recently with the Lancer.

===[[PSA Peugeot Citro<U+00EB>n]]===
:''Brands [[Peugeot]] and a vehicle by [[Citro<U+00EB>n]].''
Peugeot returned to Mexico in 1997 with the [[Peugeot 306|306]] Saloon. The 206 has had very good sales although having the Renault Clio as its hardest contender. Peugeots achieve a good sales ranking mostly because of their design.

===Renault-Nissan Alliance ([[Renault|Renault S.A.]] and [[Nissan Motors|Nissan Motor Company, Ltd.]])===
:''Brands [[Nissan]] and [[Renault]], and vehicles by [[Dacia]], [[Infiniti]] and [[Samsung]].''
Nissan is a well-known maker in Mexico and number one in sales<ref name="elsemanario.com.mx"/>, for its model Tsuru II, based on the 1991-94 Sentra and being facelifted every four years.  This car is especially prized by [[taxicab]] companies for being affordable (around $97,000 [[Mexican peso|MXN]] or $9000 [[American dollar|USD]]), strong, spacious, fast and trustworthy. This has kept it on the top 1 of sales since the 90s, and that has kept Nissan on the top sales in the country. With the Renault-Nissan Alliance, Nissan M<U+00E9>xico designed the Platina, based on the Renault Clio Symbol. The Platina is now an option for Mexican families which want more space for a small price. Nissan Mexicana sell Dacia Logan as Nissan Aprio made by Renault Brazil.
Nissan sells also one [[Cars in Mexico#Infiniti|Infiniti]] car.

First established in 1959, Renault cars were quite successful during the late 70s and early 80s, being their [[Renault 5|R5]] (nicknamed "zapatito" or "little shoe") and [[Renault 12|R12]] well-known within the Mexican people. The French pronunciation of the marque was mis-conceived as "Reh-nol", "Roh-nol" and even "Roh-<U+00F1>ol". Renault remained successful until 1986, when it left the country due of financial reasons.
Following the steps of Mercedes-Benz and most notably Peugeot, Renault returned to Mexico in late 1999 through the Mexican Autoshow (then Autoexpo) of 1999, where they offered the first generation M<U+00E9>gane Sc<U+00E9>nic's (or simply [[Renault Sc<U+00E9>nic|Sc<U+00E9>nic]]) test-drive, a feature seen for the first time in the Autoshow. This vehicle, known for being the first mid-size MPV, was introduced in 2000, and seeing a warm welcome by the Mexican buyers. The small family sedan M<U+00E9>gane followed next year, along with their best seller [[Renault Clio|Clio's]] sportive version, the [[Renault Sport|Clio II Renault Sport]]. Regarding the success of the hot hatch, Renault decided to present their Mexican-made Clio II, featuring the 2001 restyling (though the 1998 original dashboard), dark gray rims and a unique 1.6i mounted on other Renaults in order to resist Mexico's central states' heights.
The Nissan factory in [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes]] is used to assemble the Clio, Nissan's Clio sedan version the Platina and, formerly, the previous Sc<U+00E9>nic.
A facelifted Clio was introduced on late 2006 featuring new front and rear end and new interior design (from the European 2001 version) programmed to remain on sale, as in most countries, until 2010. Ironically, this Clio II outlasted new Clio's presence on the Mexican market. It is one of the two remaining French Renaults, since the M<U+00E9>gane II hatch has stopped production in Spain. Korean Koleos, Safrane and Fluence, and Colombian Sandero are expected to replace all French models by 2012.

===[[Suzuki|Suzuki Motor Corporation]]===
Suzuki arrived to Mexico in November 2005 thanks to free trade between Japan and Mexico. The Grand Vitara is still having great success and led the maker to import the Swift, also a successful model.

===[[Toyota Motor Corporation]]===
Toyota entered Mexico in early 2002, with the [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] and [[Toyota Corolla|Corolla]]. The maker was known in the country for the [[Pickup truck|pick-ups]] and cars imported (illegally) from the [[United States]]. The Corolla and the RAV4, as in the rest of the world, are very successful.

===[[Volkswagen Group]]===
:''Brands [[Audi]], [[Bentley]], [[Lamborghini]], [[SEAT]] and [[Volkswagen]].''
[[Volkswagen]] is a sales leader in Mexico, just behind Nissan and GM. The commercial success of the models [[Volkswagen Gol|Pointer]], [[Volkswagen Jetta#Fourth generation (A4, Typ 1J)|Jetta]] and [[Volkswagen Fox|Lupo]] increase considerably this carmaker's sales. Volkswagen hasn't introduced the ultra-luxury brands Lamborghini and Bugatti in Mexico (which may only be bought through specialist car dealers in major cities), however Audi and Bentley are having good sales numbers in Mexico.

Audis are very popular amongst Mexican youths and business people. The most successful models are the A4 and the A3 Sportback.

The [[Spain|Spanish]] carmaker SEAT arrived to Mexico in 2001 with the Ibiza. It has been very successful in Mexico, the strong sellers are the '''Ibiza'''  and the '''Le<U+00F3>n''' (new 1.4 and 1.8 TSi variants have been recently introduced). The '''Seat C<U+00F3>rdoba''' will be produced from next year in the Volkswagen assembly plant in Puebla as the 2.0 Tiptronic variant.

Volkswagen was introduced in Mexico in 1954 to sell the popular Beetle. A major investor in Volkswagen de Mexico dealership was Prince [[Alfonso von Hohenlohe]]. The Type 1 was officially called Sed<U+00E1>n and commonly called "Vocho" as an abbreviation of Volkswagen.

[[Volkswagen]] recently introduced the [[Volkswagen Jetta|Jetta TDi]] with 1.9 [[Diesel engine]] that is the second diesel-engineered car in Mexico since the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|Volkswagen Caribe]] Diesel (1979<U+2013>1983) which was slow-selling in this country. Unfortunately the sales of the Jetta TDi (which has a huge number of sales on its 2.0i edition) are in small numbers, encouraging to its end in this country. VW is trying to convince government and environmental authorities of the advantages of using diesel to encourage the reduction of taxes and other stimulations to increase the sales of the TDi.

''Notes:''
*''If a car's retiring year reads 2009 and its availability cell is coloured green, it means no more units will be produced nor imported, but the last units are still on sale.''
*''If a car has no retiring year marked but its availability cell is coloured red, it means either that car is in the middle of a restyling or the maker is waiting for new units to arrive.''
*''No future dates shall be given.''
*''Family, executive and leisure cars are found below, following Mexican body configurations: microauto (microcar), auto de ciudad (city car), subcompacto (supermini), compacto (small family car), mediano (large family car), lujo (executive car), miniv<U+00E1>n (MPV by size), SUV (by size), pick-up (by size), van (small LAV), van mediana (light van) and van larga (van). Sport cars are found on the lower part of each table following the same format and including (if any): roadster and coup<U+00E9>. Convertibles may not be considered sport cars.''

==Luxury==
Luxury cars in Mexico achieve good sales in most major cities such as [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Monterrey]], [[M<U+00E9>rida, Yucat<U+00E1>n|M<U+00E9>rida]], [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], and several others. In 1995, the German manufacturers [[BMW]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Porsche]] were the only luxury car suppliers available.

==Exotic==
Ferrari was the first car maker who "dared" to sell this kind of car in Mexico. It had great success in regards to the price, the priciest Ferrari models in the country reach US$400,000.

==Cars soon to enter Mexico==
''Dates given are approximate. Data is not deleted but commented out as a register of how many programmed cars make their way to Mexico since they are announced''

==Missing makers==
Few are the mainstream makers that have not official representation in Mexico but all of their models can be imported through exotic car dealers located mostly in Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz, M<U+00E9>rida, Monterrey and Guadalajara.

===[[Aston Martin]]===
Aston Martin has no official representation in Mexico, but they are imported through a certified car dealer in Mexico City called Mulsanne, with several dealerships, one in Polanco and others in rich neighborhoods of the city.

===[[Buick]]===
