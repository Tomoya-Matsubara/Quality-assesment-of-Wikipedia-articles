The '''Pale Crag Martin''' (''Ptyonoprogne obsoleta'') is a small [[passerine]] [[bird]] in the [[swallow]] family that is resident in northern Africa and in southwestern Asia east to Pakistan. It breeds mainly in the mountains, but also at lower altitudes, especially in rocky areas and around towns. Unlike most swallows, it is often found far from water. It is 12<U+2013>13&nbsp;cm (4.7<U+2013>5.1&nbsp;in) long, with mainly brown [[plumage]], paler-toned on the upper breast and underwing [[Covert (feather)|coverts]], and with white "windows" on the spread tail in flight. The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale fringes to the upperparts and [[flight feather]]s. It was formerly considered to be the northern [[subspecies]] of the [[Rock Martin]] of southern Africa, although it is smaller, paler, and whiter-throated than that species. The Pale Crag Martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a slow flight with much gliding. Its call is a soft twitter.

This martin builds a deep bowl nest on a sheltered horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, and may be built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16<U+2013>19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. [[Fledge|Fledging]] takes another 22<U+2013>24 days, although the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight.

The Pale Crag Martin is caught in flight by several fast, agile [[falcon]] species, such as [[hobby (bird)|hobbies]], and it sometimes carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. Because of its range of nearly 6&nbsp;million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2.3&nbsp;million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and a large and apparently increasing population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].

The ''Ptyonoprogne'' species are members of the swallow family of birds, and are classed as members of the Hirundininae subfamily, which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive [[river martin]]s. [[DNA sequence]] studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built.<ref name= sheldon>{{cite journal | last=Sheldon | first=Frederick H |authorlink=Fred Sheldon (ornithologist)|coauthors=Whittingham, Linda A; Moyle, Robert G; Slikas, Beth; Winkler, David W | year= 2005 | title=Phylogeny of swallows (Aves: Hirundinidae) estimated from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA | journal = [[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|Molecular phylogenetics and evolution]] | volume=35 | issue =1 |pages= 254<U+2013>270 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2004.11.008 | pmid=15737595}}</ref> These groups are the "core martins", including burrowing species like the [[Sand Martin]]; the "nest-adopters", which are birds like the [[Tree Swallow]] that utilise natural cavities; and the "mud nest builders". The ''[[Ptyonoprogne]]'' species construct open mud nests and therefore belong to the last group. ''[[Hirundo]]'' species also build open nests, ''[[Delichon]]'' house martins have a closed nest, and the ''[[Cecropis]]'' and ''[[Petrochelidon]]'' swallows have [[retort|retort-like]] closed nests with an entrance tunnel.<ref name= sheldon2>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.12.5705 |last=Winkler | first=David W | coauthors=Sheldon, Frederick H | year=1993 | url= http://www.pdfdownload.org/pdf2html/view_online.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pnas.org%2Fcontent%2F90%2F12%2F5705.full.pdf | title= Evolution of nest construction in swallows (Hirundinidae): A molecular phylogenetic perspective | journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA| volume=90 | pages=5705<U+2013>5707 | format=PDF | pmid=8516319 | issue=12 | pmc=46790}}</ref>

The genus ''Ptyonoprogne'' is closely related to the larger swallow genus ''Hirundo'', and is sometimes included within it since the nests of the ''Ptyonoprogne'' crag martins resemble those of typical ''Hirundo'' species like the [[Barn Swallow]]. However, a DNA analysis showed that if ''Hirundo'' is enlarged to contain the crag martins, it should include ''all'' the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the ''Delichon'' house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, ''Cecropis'', ''Petrochelidon'' and ''Ptyonoprogne'' should also be split off.<ref name= sheldon/> The Pale Crag Martin's nearest relatives are the other members of the genus, the [[Dusky Crag Martin]] ''P. concolor'' of southern Asia, the [[Rock Martin]] ''P. fuligula'' of Southern Africa, and the [[Eurasian Crag Martin]] ''P. rupestris''.<ref name = turner158>Turner & Rose (1989) pp. 158<U+2013>164.</ref>

In areas of Pakistan where its range overlaps with that of the Dusky Crag Martin, the Pale Crag Martin breeds at a higher altitude.<ref name = turner163/> Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian Crag Martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the Pale Crag Martin favours more arid habitats.<ref name = vaurie/> In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level.

== Description ==

[[File:Pale Crag-martin.ogg|right|thumb|[[Personal grooming|Preening]] while perched on a post|alt= A Pale Crag Martin preens its feathers while perching on a wooden post]]
The Pale Crag Martin of the nominate subspecies ''P. o. obsoleta'' is 12<U+2013>13&nbsp;cm (4.7<U+2013>5.1&nbsp;in) long with light brown upperparts, becoming paler on the lower back, and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. It has a pale grey throat, upper breast and underwing [[Covert (feather)|coverts]], and the rest of the underparts are a dirty white.<ref name = collins258>Mullarney ''et al.'' (1999) p. 258.</ref> The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The wing length averages 1.3&nbsp;cm (4.55&nbsp;in) and the tail averages 4.8&nbsp;cm (1.9&nbsp;in).<ref name= > Murray (2005) p. 141.</ref> The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed in the table above.<ref name = turner160/>

This martin [[moulting|moults]] early, with adults having completely replaced their feathers by late August. Juveniles moult somewhat later,<ref name = vaurie/> and their old [[Flight feather#Primaries|primary feathers]] are retained even when the body has mainly adult plumage.<ref name= Duivendijk>van Duivendijk (2011) p. 262.</ref> 

The Pale Crag Martin's flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides, and it is more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian Crag Martin. It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a ''trrt'' resembling the call of the [[Common House Martin]], a nasal ''vick'',<ref name = collins240>Mullarney ''et al.'' (1999) p. 240.</ref> and a high pitched ''twee'' contact call.<ref name = turner160/>

The Pale Crag Martin is much drabber than most African swallows, and confusion is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins of the genus ''[[Riparia]]''.<ref name = turner160/> It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian Crag Martin,<ref name = bwp/> and has smaller tail spots.<ref name = barlow80>Barlow ''et al.'' (1997) p. 80</ref> It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the Rock Martin. In the far east of its range, the Pale Crag Martin always has lighter underparts than the Dusky Crag Martin.<ref name = turner158/> Although only slightly larger than the Sand Martin and [[Brown-throated Sand Martin]], the Pale Crag Martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band.<ref name = bwp/> Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles. The fast flight of the Brown-throated Sand Martin also makes identification more difficult.<ref name= Harris>Harris ''et al'' (1996) pp. 162<U+2013>164.</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:City of Aswan seen from the air.jpg|Desert towns like [[Aswan]] in Egypt provide man-made nest sites|thumb|alt= Building next to lake with bare sand-coloured hills in the background]]
The Pale Crag Martin breeds in suitable habitats throughout northern Africa and through the Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. In addition, there is some short-range movement, including martins from southern Arabia crossing the [[Red Sea]] and wintering alongside the local breeding birds in Ethiopia and the [[Horn of Africa]],<ref name = turner160/><ref name= ash>Ash (2009) p. 257.</ref><ref name= Redman>Redman ''et al'' (2011) p. 254.</ref> and non-breeding ''P. f. spatzi'' and ''P. f. presaharica'' joining Rock Martins in Mali and Mauritania.<ref name = Barlow>Barlow ''et al.'' (1997) pp. 276<U+2013>277.</ref> In Pakistan, the breeding range of the subspecies ''P. f. peloplasta'' overlaps with that of the Dusky Crag Martin, although that species breeds at much lower levels,<ref name = turner160/> and in North Africa ''P. f. obsoleta'' occupies desert habitats whilst the Eurasian Crag Martin is found in the mountains.<ref name= Bergier>{{cite journal | last= Bergier | first= Patrick | coauthors= | month= | year= 2007| title= L'Hirondelle isabelline ''Ptyonoprogne fuligula'' au Maroc | journal= Go-South Bulletin | volume= 4| issue = |language = French | pages= 6<U+2013>25 | url = http://gosouthbeta.net63.net/08_Go_SouthBulletin/go-south_bull_4_6-25.pdf | doi = }}</ref> The Pale Crag Martin has been recorded as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] in Bahrain, Qatar,<ref name= Jennings/> Kuwait, and Sri Lanka,<ref name= birdlife/> although its occurrence in the last country is treated as unproven in a 2011 [[field guide]].<ref name= Harrison>Harrison & Worfolk (2011) p. 159.</ref> The martin has been claimed to visit Turkey, but this is also disputed.<ref name= Welch>Welch ''et al'' (2008) p. 292.</ref>

The natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs, gorges and caves up to 3,700&nbsp;m (12,000&nbsp;ft) above sea level,<ref name = baker2>Baker (1926) pp. [http://www.archive.org/stream/BakerFbiBirds3/BakerFBI3#page/n261/mode/1up/ 238<U+2013>239]</ref> but this martin also breeds in lowlands, especially if rocks or buildings are available, and may be found far from water. This species readily uses man-made structures as a substitute for natural precipices,<ref name = turner160/> and has bred on houses in southern Israel since the 1970s. In Egypt it may breed near monuments like [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] or in desert towns such as [[Aswan]].<ref name = bwp>Snow & Perrins (1998) pp. 1058<U+2013>1059.</ref> It uses towns, bridges and cliffs in Ethiopia,<ref name= ash/> and [[tower block]]s  in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the breeding season, the martin needs mud or wet soil to construct its nests, and this is normally readily found near human habitations. This species appears to be scarce in some forested and coastal areas with high [[humidity]], in which the [[Red-rumped Swallow]] tends to be the common hirundine.<ref name= Jennings/>

== Behaviour ==
=== Breeding ===
[[File:Ptyonoprogne obsoleta MHNT.jpg|thumb|Eggs|alt=whitish eggs with grey and brown blotching]]
Pale Crag Martin pairs often nest alone, especially in the [[Sahara]],<ref name= bwp/> although where suitable sites are available small loose [[Bird colony|colonies]] may form. This martin aggressively defends its nesting territory against [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]] and other species. In Africa breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions,<ref name = turner160/> but in northwest Africa February to April is normal,<ref name= bwp/> and in Asia nesting is from April to June.<ref name = baker2/> Two broods are common, and three have been raised in a season.<ref name = Jennings/>

The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with feathers and soft, dry grass, hair, sheep<U+2019>s wool or plant down.<ref name = Jennings/> It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl like that of the Barn Swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years.<ref name = turner160/> Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lave flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting Pale Crag Martins, Red-rumped Swallows, and the Little Swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests.<ref name = Jenningscaves>{{cite web| author = Jennings, Michael C | title= Birds in Arabian caves | work= | url= http://www.saudicaves.com/birds/index.htm
| publisher= [http://www.saudicaves.com Desert Caves Project]| accessdate =24 November 2012 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CPtvbjc8 | archivedate=24 November 2012 | deadurl = no }}</ref><ref name= Chantler/> In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.<ref name = Jennings/>

The clutch is usually two or three buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown, particularly at the wide end. The average egg size for Asian birds was 19.3&nbsp;x&nbsp;12.9&nbsp;mm (0.76&nbsp;x&nbsp;0.51&nbsp;in) with a weight of 1.7&nbsp;g (0.06&nbsp;oz). Both adults incubate the eggs for 16<U+2013>19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they [[fledge]] and for several days after they can fly. The fledging time can vary from 22<U+2013>24&nbsp;days to 25<U+2013>30&nbsp;days, though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food.<ref name = turner160/><!-- Ref applies to all preceding --> If a nest is destroyed, or the breeding attempt otherwise fails, a replacement clutch may be laid, typically with fewer eggs. Two nests in Arabia were used in spring and again in the autumn, but it is not known if the same pair were involved.<ref name = Jennings/>

=== Feeding ===
[[File:Ptyonoprogneobsoleta 1 cropped.jpg|thumb|''Ptyonoprogne obsoleta obsoleta'' in Egypt]]
The Pale Crag Martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, although it will occasionally feed on the ground. Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory, flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills.<ref name = turner160/> Cliff faces generate [[standing wave]]s in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.<ref name= fantur>{{cite journal | last= Fantur | first= von Roman | coauthors= | month= | year= 1997| title= Die Jagdstrategie der Felsenschwalbe (''Hirundo rupestris'') |trans_title=The hunting strategy of the crag martin | journal= Carinthia | volume= 187| issue = 107 | pages= 229<U+2013>252| url = http://www.biologiezentrum.at/pdf_frei_remote/CAR_187_107_0229-0252.pdf | language = German with English summary | doi = }}</ref> When not breeding, they may also hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[ant]]s and [[beetle]]s. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at [[wildfire|grass fire]]s to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300&nbsp;may form where food is abundant,<ref name = turner160/> such as agricultural areas, [[wetland]]s and sewage works. The Pale Crag Martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface,<ref name= Jennings/> although at least some of its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes.<ref name= kam>{{cite journal| last= Kam | first= Michael | coauthors= Degen, A Allan; Nagy, Kenneth A | year=1987 | title= Seasonal energy, water, and food consumption of Negev Chukars and Sand Partridges | journal= Ecology | volume= 68 | issue = 4 | pages=1029<U+2013>1037 | url = |format = | doi =10.2307/1938374 }}</ref> Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry, rocky areas in which the Pale Rock Martin nests, so there is little competition for food.<ref name= Jennings/>

== Status ==
The Pale Crag Martin has a very large range of 5.9&nbsp;million&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (2.29&nbsp;million&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi). The total population is unknown, but the bird is described as very common in Jordan and common in Egypt. It has an expanding range and increasing population. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the Pale Crag Martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name= birdlife/>

This species is locally common in Algeria, scarce in Morocco,<ref name= bwp/> and scarce in Pakistan.<ref name= birdlife/> It has colonised southern Israel, where it breeds on houses, in the 1970s,<ref name= bwp/> and large numbers may occur outside the breeding season in Saudi Arabia and Oman.<ref name= turner160/> Population estimates include 10,000&nbsp;to 100,000&nbsp;pairs breeding in Egypt,<ref name= bwp/> 10,000&nbsp;pairs in the United Arab Emirates, and an Arabian winter population of up to 150,000&nbsp;birds in flocks that sometimes contain 300<U+2013>500&nbsp;birds. A large breeding range expansion in the Arabian Peninsula has been aided by the use of high-rise buildings as nesting sites, and possibly a greater supply of insects from agricultural land. Breeding is now regular in Abu Dhabi, and Qatar's tall buildings may be the next site for colonisation.<ref name= Jennings> Jennings (2010) pp. [http://www.libri.ch/app_web/en/services/pdf/Excerpt%20FoA_25_500-501.pdf 500<U+2013>501]. </ref> The Pale Crag Martin first bred in Iraq in 2009.<ref name= ararat>{{cite journal| last= Ararat | first= Korsh | coauthors = Fadhil, Omar: Porter, R F; Salim, Mudhafar | year=2011 | title= Breeding birds in Iraq: important new discoveries | journal= Sandgrouse | volume= 33 | issue =  | pages= 12<U+2013>33 | url = http://www.natureiraq.org/site/sites/default/files/Ararat_et_al_Sandgrouse33-1_2011_compressed_Acro5%5B1%5D.pdf | format = | doi =  }}</ref>
