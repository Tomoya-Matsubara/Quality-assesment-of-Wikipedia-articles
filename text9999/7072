The '''Gulfstream American GA-7 Cougar''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Aluminium|all-metal]], 4-seat, twin-engined [[light aircraft]].<ref name="Airliners" /> 

The Cougar was a twin-engine development of the [[Grumman American AA-5|Gulfstream American AA-5B Tiger]] and traces its lineage to the [[Grumman American AA-1|AA-1 Yankee Clipper]] and the [[Bede BD-1]].

== Development ==
Following [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream Aerospace<U+2019>s]] purchase of [[Grumman|Grumman<U+2019>s]] American light aircraft division in 1977, the company embarked on a policy of aircraft model development. During this time the other aircraft in the line, including the [[Grumman American AA-1|AA-1B Trainer]] and the [[Grumman American AA-5|AA-5B Tiger]] underwent extensive redesign. 

The aircraft line Gulfstream then fielded included the redesigned [[Grumman American AA-1|AA-1C Lynx]] two seater, the [[Grumman American AA-5|Gulfstream American AA-5A Cheetah]] and the [[Grumman American AA-5|Gulfstream American AA-5B Tiger]] single engine aircraft. The next obvious step was to develop the existing twin-engined version of the AA-5, which Grumman American had first flown as a prototype on 20 December 1974. Gulfstream did extensive redesign work on the former Grumman project and the Gulfstream production prototype did not fly until 14 January 1977.<ref name="Wood" />

The Cougar uses the same honeycomb and bonded metal construction that is the hallmark of the line since the BD-1. The prototype's single spar wing was upgraded to a double-spar configuration and this allowed a [[wet wing]]. The resulting aircraft was designated the GA-7 (for Gulfstream American) and was given the name ''Cougar'' in keeping with the existing Lynx, Cheetah and Tiger names for aircraft in the company's line.<ref name="Airliners" /> 

The Cougar was intended for the flying school twin-engined trainer market and also as a personal use aircraft. The Cougar is powered by a pair of wing-mounted [[Lycoming O-320|Lycoming O-320-D1D]] engines of {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It carries four people at maximum cruise speed of {{convert|160|kn|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and a typical cruise speed of {{convert|140|kn|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. It was certified under US [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Regulations of Interest#Part 23|FAR Part 23]] on 22 September 1977.<ref name="Airliners" /><ref name="Wood" /><ref name="A17SO">{{cite web|url = http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/B2CEC2BAFD278D88862572A00056C584?OpenDocument&Highlight=ga-7|title = TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET NO. A17SO|accessdate = 2008-07-02|last = [[Federal Aviation Administration]]|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = March}}</ref>

Production of the Cougar ran for only two model years, 1978 and 1979 before production was halted. Just 115 Cougars were delivered.<ref name="Airliners" /><ref name="A17SO" />

In 1995 the type certificate for the GA-7 was sold to [[SOCATA]] of [[France]] who intended to develop the aircraft and produce it as the TB 320 Tangara. The Tangara was to be powered by two [[Lycoming O-360|Lycoming O-360-A1G6]] engines of {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} each. The first Tangara was a modified Cougar, had {{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engines and first flew in mid-1996. The complete Tangara prototype was also a converted Cougar and had the {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engines. It first flew in February 1997. Despite SOCATA's plans to put the Tangara into production this never occurred.<ref name="Airliners" /><ref name="A17SO" />
