== History ==
=== Formation and early works (1995<U+2013>97) ===
In February 1995, [[Sully Erna]] decided to start a new band as the lead singer after playing the drums for more than 23 years, including over two years in the now-defunct band Strip Mind.<ref name="Godsmack biography">{{cite web |url= http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070930171134/http://www.godsmack.com/bio/bio.asp |archivedate= September 30, 2007 |title=Godsmack <U+2013> Bio |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |last= |first=|date=|publisher=Godsmack.com}}</ref> His new band The Scam formed with Erna on vocals, [[Robbie Merrill]] on bass, local guitarist and friend Lee Richards on guitar, and [[Tommy Stewart]] on drums. The Scam quickly changed its name to Godsmack, after recording one demo.<ref name="Rolling Stone with Sully">{{cite web| author=Scaggs, Austin |date=May 6, 2003 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/godsmack/articles/story/5936304/sully_awakes |title=Sully Awakes |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |accessdate=December 2, 2007}}</ref> The newly formed band started playing small bars in their hometown of [[Boston, Mass.]] Locally popular songs such as "[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]" and "[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]" soon brought them to the top of the hit charts in the Boston/New England area.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

The band's name, according to Merrill in the ''[[Smack This!]]'' DVD, was taken from the [[Alice in Chains]]' song "[[God Smack (song)|God Smack]]". However, Erna stated in a 1999 interview that "I was making fun of somebody who had a [[cold sore]] on his lip and the next day I had one myself and somebody said, It looks like God just smacked you in the face for making fun. The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the [[Alice in Chains]] song but didn't really think much about it. It's a cool song and the name had meaning for us".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/1999/godsmack_int.asp |title=Sully Erna of Godsmack on Karma, Christians and the Law of Three (NY Rock) |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |first=Gabriella |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=Nyrock.com}}</ref>

In 1996, [[Tony Rombola]] and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left after finding out he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences.<ref name="Richards leaving stuff">{{cite web| author=Seaver, Morley |url=http://www.rocknworld.com/morley/06/Godsmack.shtml |title=MorleyView Interview with Shannon Larkin of Godsmack |publisher=MorleyView |accessdate=December 6, 2007}}</ref> In the same year the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled ''[[All Wound Up (album)|All Wound Up]]''. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

For the next two years, the band played throughout the Boston area. Eventually Godsmack's CD landed in the hands of Rocko, the night-time DJ for Boston radio station [[WAAF (FM)]]. The radio station put "[[Keep Away (song)|Keep Away]]" into heavy rotation and the song rose to the number one spot at the station very quickly.<ref name="Godsmack biography"/> Newbury Comics, a New England record store chain, agreed to sell the CD on consignment. Shortly after the success of "Keep Away", Godsmack went back into the studio and recorded a single titled "[[Whatever (Godsmack song)|Whatever]]", which became the new local favorite on WAAF (FM).<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>

In an interview [[Sully Erna]] stated, "We had been selling maybe 50 copies a month at the time WAAF picked up the album. All of a sudden we started moving over a thousand records a week. It was insane. Even crazier, I was doing all this from my bedroom. After years of grinding away, things finally started taking off".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barrystickets.com/concert-tickets/godsmack-tickets.php |title=Godsmack biography <U+2013> Barrystickets |accessdate=January 2, 2008 |publisher=barrystickets.com}}</ref>

=== ''Godsmack'' (1998<U+2013>99) ===
In  mid-1998, [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Republic Records]] signed the band to their label. Joe D'arco was dismissed from the band due to a problem with [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] and his consequent inability to perform live without making errors. He was replaced by former drummer [[Tommy Stewart]], who returned after expressing a desire to be in the band again.<ref name="Drummer switch">{{cite web| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&Date=8/13/2002 |title=Godsmack's Sully Erna Speaks out on drummer switch |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 13, 2002 |accessdate=December 6, 2007}}</ref> The band's first studio recording ''All Wound Up'' was re-mastered, and the finished self-titled debut CD album ''[[Godsmack (album)|Godsmack]]'' was released to the public six weeks later. This led to the band's first headlining tour, "The Godsmack Tour".<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>
After the album's release the band went on the road playing club shows as well as playing at [[Ozzfest]] and [[Woodstock 1999|Woodstock '99]]. This was followed by a tour in [[Europe]] supporting [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name="Godsmack biography"/>  Roxanne Blanford from Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, stating,  "Godsmack confidently brought metal into the technological age".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:qjuh6j4o71u0|title=Godsmack <U+2013> self-titled review |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |last=Blanford |first=Roxanne |date= |publisher=Allmusic }}</ref> The album entered the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' at number twenty-two,<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web

The album sold well despite being initially pulled from the shelves in some stores due to concerns over some of its [[Lyrics|lyrical]] content.<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy">{{cite web| title=Godsmack Lyrics and Biography |url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002718/Godsmack.html| accessdate=November 10, 2007| last=Schwalboski |first=Ann M|publisher=Musician guide }}</ref>  The band and its [[record label]] later added a [[Parental Advisory]] sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine stating, "Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint&nbsp;... Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective&nbsp;... We have decided to put a sticker on the record".<ref name="Godsmack lyrics cause controversy"/> This controversy did not appear to adversely affect album sales but, according to Erna, helped, "It's almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we're saying on it".

The album was released on {{Nowrap|October 31}}, 2000. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard 200'', and has been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="Billboard"/> "[[Vampires (song)|Vampires]]", a song on the album, also earned the band a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2002/grammys.htm |title=Rock On The Net: 44th Annual Grammy Awards <U+2013> 2002 |publisher=Rock on the Net |accessdate=October 10, 2007}}</ref>
With the release of ''Awake'', Godsmack toured Europe supporting [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=12414 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070816090445/http://godsmack.com/tour/tour.asp?catID=12414 |archivedate=August 16, 2007 |title=Godsmack <U+2013> Tour 2001 |publisher=Godsmack.com |accessdate=November 10, 2007}}</ref> Erna said at the time, "we've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of ''Awake'' was written on tour while we were ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. "[[Ozzfest]]" was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; we did a lot of work on our own".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msopr.com/?q=node/450 |title=Godsmack |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Mitch Schneider Organization }}</ref> The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Two of the songs on the album were used in United States military commercials ("[[Sick of Life]]" and "[[Awake (song)|Awake]]") as background music. Erna stated, "Someone in the military is a fan, and they asked if they could use the music, and we accepted".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=51830 |title=Godsmack Frontman Gets Defensive Over Band's Alleged 'Pro-Military' Stance |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |first=Arthur |date=May 4, 2006 |publisher=Arthur Magazine }}</ref> However, Erna insists that Godsmack does not support any war stating that; "By no means has this band ever supported any war for any country or that we support government decisions or why we're sticking our nose in other people's business at times. What we support is our troops. And the women and men that go over there<U+2014>or anywhere<U+2014>to fight for our country and our lives and protect our freedom and I feel that."<ref name="ArthurMag">{{cite web |url=http://www.arthurmag.com/magpie/?p=1244 |title=Talking to Godsmack (Whose Album is No. 1 on the charts) about what they use their music for.|accessdate= |last= |first= |date=May 6, 2006 |publisher=ArthurMag.com}}</ref>

In 2002, Erna was asked to write and perform a song for the soundtrack to ''[[The Scorpion King]]''. The motion picture was the third in the ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|Mummy]]'' saga, and was a spin-off prequel of the ''Mummy'' series. The song Godsmack wrote and performed was titled "[[I Stand Alone (song)|I Stand Alone]]" and became the number 1 single at Rock Radio and the most played Active Rock song in 2002 for 14 weeks straight. It was also used in the game [[Prince of Persia: Warrior Within]].

''Faceless'' managed to beat West Coast [[nu metal]] rival [[Linkin Park]], with the release of their second studio album ''[[Meteora]]'', which dropped to number two on the ''Billboard 200''. ''Faceless'' also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at that position for two weeks. A massive Tour of America and Europe supporting Metallica followed.

The lead single "[[Straight Out of Line]]" received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for "Best Hard Rock Performance." The award went to [[Evanescence]]'s single, "[[Bring Me to Life]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=godsmack&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1 |title=Grammy Award Winners |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |publisher=Grammy.com }}</ref>

The album got its name after a swimming-pool incident, retold by Larkin; "Sully and I were standing up for one more jump, we're both there buck-naked, and I look over to the left and there's some woman who had just opened the blinds standing there with her mouth wide open". Erna added, "She was just waking up, we go, 'Sorry', and then boom, right into the pool. The next thing we know the cops are banging on the door, and that's sort of the point of calling the record ''Faceless''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/godsmack/news_feature_030418/index2.jhtml |title=Godsmack: Unpolished, Uncompromised

''IV'' has since been certified gold. The band had written over forty songs for the album, but the final track listing had eleven tracks, Larkin commented, "it's Sully's band and his vision. He sifted through all the music and picked the songs that he wanted on the album. We all said 'all right'. He's always had the vision of everything Godsmack from the artwork to the production to the engineer to the studio to what TV shows we play. Everything.

The album's minimalist name "IV" derives not only from its being the band's fourth studio album, but also from a running piece of backstage humor, as related by Larkin and Erna:

{{Quote|We have this security guy, a big, tough guy named J.C. He's another Boston guy. And in Boston it's "fou." They don't really have the "R." It's not "four," it's "fou." He'd be hanging around backstage and chicks would walk by and he would rate them from one to 10. But if it wasn't a 10, there was no one, two, three, or five. It was always you were a 10 or a fou. He just pulled the funniest things. Sometimes, he'd just hold up four fingers and wouldn't have to say it anymore and we'd all just bust out laughing. And then the funniest one, this guy walked by with a chick on each arm and he goes, "Hey, bub, two fous don't make an eight!" So when it came up, it's our fourth full-length record, everybody was like, "Fou!" And we were like, "That's it, man." We're not trying to break any records for originality here. I know that there's ''[[Led Zeppelin&nbsp;IV]]'', ''[[4 (Foreigner album)|Foreigner&nbsp;IV]]'', a million IVs. We just thought it's fitting.<ref name="Interview with Shannon">{{cite web |url=http://www.live-metal.net/features_interviews_godsmack.html |title=<U+2018>Livin in Sin' with Godsmack's Shannon Larkin |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |last= |first=|date=May 6, 2006|publisher=Live-Metal.Net}}</ref><ref name="The music and magic of Godsmack

Erna had this to say about the early sound album, "It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Cr<U+00FC>e Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face. I don't think there's going to be any 'Voodoo's or 'Serenity's on this one. We decided to go balls out!".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=120646|title=Godsmack Working On 'Really Heavy' New Album |accessdate= |last= |first= |date=May 27, 2009 |publisher=Blabbermouth.Net}}</ref>
