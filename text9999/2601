[[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] '''Sir Colin Thomas Hannah''' [[Order of St Michael and St George|KCMG]], [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]] (22 December 1914 &ndash; 22 May 1978) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and a [[Governors of Queensland|Governor of Queensland]]. Born in [[Western Australia]], he served in the [[militia]] before joining the RAAF in 1935. He led [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No. 6 Squadron]] in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific]] during [[World War II]], rising to the rank of [[Group Captain]] by 1944. 

Hannah was Senior Air Staff Officer at Far East Air Force Headquarters, [[Singapore]], during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in the 1950s. His other post-war appointments included Deputy Chief of the Air Staff from 1961 to 1965 and [[Air Officer Commanding]] Operational Command (later [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]) from 1965 to 1967. In 1970 he was promoted [[Air Marshal]] and became [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS), the RAAF's senior position. Hannah concluded his tour as CAS a year early, in 1972, to become Governor of Queensland. He retired in 1977.

==Early career==
[[Image:P00020.003Hannah1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flying Officer Hannah (front row, right) as Adjutant at RAAF Pearce, Western Australia, in 1938]]
Born in [[Menzies, Western Australia]], Hannah was the son of Thomas Howard Hannah, a [[Civil service|public servant]] who later became a [[magistrate]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and his wife Johanna. Hannah attended the [[Hale School]], leaving with a Junior Certificate in 1930.<ref name="ADB">Coulthard-Clark , ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.374&ndash;375</ref> He served with a [[militia]] unit, the 8th Field Artillery Brigade, for six months in 1933, before becoming a clerk in the Crown Law Department of the State Public Service.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Dennis">Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p.286</ref> 

Hannah joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in January 1935 as an air cadet at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], gaining his commission as a [[Pilot Officer]] in July 1936.<ref name="Dennis"/> Posted initially to [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No. 22 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|Richmond]], [[New South Wales]], he joined [[No. 23 Squadron RAAF|No. 23 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Laverton Base|Laverton]], Victoria, in May 1937. Hannah accompanied No. 23 Squadron to its new location at the recently opened [[RAAF Base Pearce|RAAF Station Pearce]], Western Australia, in March 1938. He married Patricia Gordon at [[Claremont, Western Australia|Claremont]] in January 1939.<ref name="ADB"/>

==World War II==
Promoted [[Flight Lieutenant]], Hannah was in England on a [[Royal Air Force]] armaments training course when [[World War II]] began in September 1939. He completed the course, and returned to Australia in March 1940. After brief postings to No.1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Headquarters Laverton, Hannah was sent to Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne, in May. He was made an acting [[Squadron Leader]] in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the following year. In April 1942, Hannah was promoted temporary [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]].<ref name="ADB"/>

[[Image:OG0343Beaufort6Sqn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beauforts of Nos. 6 and 8 Squadron at Goodenough Island, November 1943]]
In November 1943, Hannah was given command of [[No. 6 Squadron RAAF|No. 6 Squadron]] at [[Milne Bay]], [[Papua (Australian territory)|Papua]], flying [[Bristol Beaufort]] light bombers against Japanese targets in [[Rabaul]].<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/06.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.99&ndash;103]</ref> While on a familiarisation flight he came under [[friendly fire]] from [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] on [[Kiriwina|Kiriwina Island]], but managed to avoid serious injury. Hannah was raised to temporary [[Group Captain]] in December. He led No. 71 Wing for the first two months of 1944, until he was evacuated due to illness. After six weeks recuperation at Laverton, Hannah returned to No. 6 Squadron, which was by now based at [[Goodenough Island]].<ref name="ADB"/> He was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at Headquarters Western Area Command, Perth, in September and took charge of the Area from June 1945 to May 1946.<ref name="Dennis"/>

==Post-war RAAF career==
===Rise to Chief of the Air Staff===
Hannah was posted to Britain in 1947, undertaking study at [[RAF Staff College, Andover]], and serving as SASO at RAAF Overseas Headquarters in [[London]]. In August 1950 he took over [[No. 82 Wing RAAF|No. 82 Wing]], flying [[Avro Lincoln]] heavy bombers, at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], [[Queensland]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Dennis"/> Hannah was made an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the 1951 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|New Year Honours]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=39105|supp=yes|startpage=36|date=29 December 1950|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref> In September that year he was appointed Director of Personnel Services, which became Director-General of Personnel in July 1952. As an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]], Hannah was heavily involved in planning the RAAF's part in the 1954 Royal Tour of Australia.<ref name="ADB"/> He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] that June.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=40189|supp=yes|startpage=3296|date=1 June 1954|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref> 

In 1955, Hannah attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in London, and was promoted [[Air Commodore]].<ref name="ADB"/> He was posted to [[Singapore]] as SASO, Headquarters Far East Air Force, in January 1956, handling [[counter-insurgency]] operations during the [[Malayan Emergency]].<ref name="Dennis"/> Hannah's service during the conflict was recognised with his appointment as a [[Order of the Bath|Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in June 1959.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=41739|supp=yes|startpage=3905|date=12 June 1959|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref> As Director-General of Plans and Policy from March 1959, he was responsible for commencing transfer of the Department of Air from [[Melbourne]] to [[Canberra]]. In December 1961, Hannah was appointed Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, gaining promotion to acting [[Air Vice Marshal]] in May 1962; the rank was made substantive in January 1963. He was [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Operational Command (now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]) from February 1965 to December 1967, after which he became AOC Support Command.<ref name="ADB"/>

===Chief of the Air Staff===
Hannah was promoted [[Air Marshal]] on 1 January 1970, succeeding Air Marshal Sir [[Alister Murdoch]] as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Dennis"/> In March 1970, the-then [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister of Defence]], [[Malcolm Fraser]], commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the [[Royal Australian Navy]] should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. However, confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to "avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force".<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.312&ndash;313</ref> Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee]], [[Victor Smith|Admiral Sir Victor Smith]], to use the soon-to-be-delivered [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111 bomber]] for maritime support, among its other roles.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.392</ref> He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1971 New Year Honours.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=45263|supp=yes|startpage=34|date=31 December 1970|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref>

Hannah's tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF's [[Golden Jubilee]] in March&ndash;April 1971. He personally organised a fly-past of two [[United States Air Force|USAF]] F-111s at [[air show]]s marking the occasion, generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type's long-delayed entry into Australian service.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.451</ref> However, Hannah was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year. Firstly, he was a member of the committee to choose an [[Royal Australian Air Force Memorial, Canberra|Air Force memorial]] to be located on [[ANZAC Parade, Canberra]]. The selected design was an abstract sculpture that, according to RAAF historian Dr Alan Stephens, reflected "the selection panel's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service".<ref name="Going Solo, pp.452-453">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.452&ndash;453</ref> Secondly, Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force's winter uniform, traditionally a shade "somewhere between royal and navy blue" that had been chosen personally by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour.<ref name="Going Solo, pp.452-453"/> The uniform approved by Hannah, an all-purpose middle blue suit, was the object of numerous complaints in the ensuing years, and reverted to Williams' original colour and style in 2000.<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.305</ref>

==Governor==
Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was cut short by some ten months when he accepted the [[Governors of Queensland|Governship of Queensland]], becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a [[vice regal]] appointment. The announcement was made in January 1972, and he took office on 21 March.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=45638|supp=yes|startpage=4071|date=6 April 1972|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref> Hannah was criticised for failing to consult with senior colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) [[Charles Read (RAAF officer)|Charles Read]].<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p.454</ref>
 
Described as "a man with the flexibility of mind and ability to mix with people, so necessary for a Governor",<ref name="ADB"/> Hannah was appointed [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (KCMG) in September 1972.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=45776|supp=yes|startpage=10843|date=12 September 1972|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref> The same year, he was made a  [[Venerable Order of Saint John|Knight and Deputy Prior of the Venerable Order of Saint John]]. However, he created controversy at a Brisbane Chamber of Commerce luncheon in October 1975, criticising the "fumbling ineptitude" of [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]]'s Federal [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] Government for placing Australia in "its present economic state".<ref name="ADB"/> In response, the Federal Government advised the Queen to revoke Hannah's [[dormant commission]] to serve in place of the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] if the latter was absent. Following his succession as Prime Minister in November 1975, Malcolm Fraser attempted to have the dormant commission reinstated, but the British Government refused to recommend this to the Queen, citing lack of impartiality on Hannah's part. Queensland premier [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] made it known that he planned to extend the Governor's term, but the British Government also refused to agree to this, and Hannah's tenure was permitted to lapse on 20 March 1977.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="SMH">{{cite journal | last = | first = | date = 10 February 2007 | title = The hidden hand of her majesty | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-hidden-hand-of-her-majesty/2007/02/09/1170524304007.html?page=fullpage | journal = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2008-11-25}}</ref>

==Retirement and legacy==
Hannah retired following completion of his term as Governor of Queensland.<ref name="Dennis"/> He was appointed a [[Royal Victorian Order|Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order]] (KCVO) in August 1977 (backdated to March) as part of Queen Elizabeth II's [[Silver Jubilee]] visit to Australia.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=47292|supp=yes|startpage=10154|date=5 August 1977|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=22 November}}</ref> Hannah died of a [[myocardial infarction]] on 22 May 1978 in [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland]]. Survived by his wife and daughter, he was given a state funeral and cremated.<ref name="ADB"/> Hannah Community Park, straddling the suburbs of [[Fadden, Australian Capital Territory|Fadden]] and [[Gowrie, Australian Capital Territory|Gowrie]] in Canberra, was established in his honour in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | date = 26 September 2002 | title = Legislative Assembly for the ACT: 2002 Week 11 Page 3326 | work= Hansard | publisher=ACT Legislative Assembly  |url=http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/Hansard/2002/week11/3326.htm | accessyear = 2008 |accessdaymonth = 23 November| page=3326}}</ref>
