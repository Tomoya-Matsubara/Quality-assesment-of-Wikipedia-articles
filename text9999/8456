The '''Florida Cracker Horse''' is a breed of [[horse]] from [[Florida]] in the United States. It is genetically and physically similar to many other Spanish-style horses, especially those from the [[Spanish Colonial Horse]] group. The Florida Cracker is a [[gaited horse|gaited breed]] known for its agility and speed. Horses were first brought to Florida by the Spanish in the early 1500s, where they were used extensively for herding cattle. These horses developed into the Florida Cracker type seen today, and continued to be used by Florida cowboys (known as "crackers") until the 1930s. At this point they were superseded by [[American Quarter Horse]]s needed to work larger cattle brought to Florida during the [[Dust Bowl]], and population numbers declined precipitously. Through the efforts of several private families and the Florida government, the breed was saved from extinction, but there is still concern about its low numbers. Both the [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] and the [[Equus Survival Trust]] consider breed numbers to be at a critical point.

==Characteristics==
The Florida Cracker Horse is also known as the Chickasaw Pony, Seminole Pony, Prairie Pony, Florida Horse, Florida Cow Pony and Grass Gut.<ref name=Dutson/><ref name=Official/> The modern breed retains the size of its [[Iberian horse|Spanish ancestors]], standing {{hands|13.2|to|15}} high and weighing {{convert|750|to|1000|lbs|kg}}. They are found mainly in [[bay (horse)|bay]], [[black (horse)|black]] and [[gray (horse)|gray]], although [[grullo]], [[dun gene|dun]] and [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] are also seen.<ref name=Dutson/> [[Roan (horse)|Roan]] and [[pinto horse|pinto]] colors are occasionally found.<ref name=HorseChannel>{{cite web|url=http://www.horsechannel.com/horse-news/florida-cracker-state-horse.aspx|title=Official designation for the Florida Cracker Horse|author=McAllister, Toni|date=2007-09-18|accessdate=2010-10-11|publisher=BowTie, Inc}}</ref> They have straight or slightly concave profiles, strong backs and sloping [[rump (animal)|croups]]. They are still known for their speed and agility and excel at trail and [[endurance riding]], and are also used extensively as stock horses and are also seen in [[Western riding]] sports such as [[working cow horse]], [[team roping]] and [[team penning]].

==History==
Horses first arrived on the southeast North American mainland in 1521, during [[Juan Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n|Ponce de Leon]]'s second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. More horses and cattle were brought to [[Spanish Florida]] by later expeditions. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially in what is now northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included [[Barb (horse)|Barbs]], [[Garrano]]s, [[Spanish Jennet]]s, [[Sorraia]]s, [[Andalusian horse|Andalusians]] and other [[Iberian horse|Iberian breeds]]. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.<ref name=Dutson/>

The early cattle drivers, nicknamed [[Florida cracker]]s and [[Georgia cracker]]s, used these Spanish horses to drive cattle (eventually known as [[Florida Cracker cattle]]).<ref name=Dutson/> The cowboys received their nickname from the distinctive cracking of their whips, and the name was transferred to both the horses they rode and the cattle they herded.<ref name=HorseChannel/> Through their primary use as [[stock horse]]s, the type developed into the Florida Cracker horse, known for its speed, endurance and agility. From the mid-16th century to the 1930s, this type was the predominant horse in the southeastern United States.<ref name=Dutson/> During the [[American Civil War]] (1861<U+2013>1865), both belligerents purchased large amounts of beef from Florida, and the Spanish horses bred there were highly desired as riding horses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.florida-agriculture.com/livestock/cracker_cattle.htm|title=Florida Cracker Cattle and Horse Program|publisher=Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> During this time, there was also a continual introduction of new Spanish blood from Cuba, as horses were traded between the two areas.<ref name=ALBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/floridacracker.html|title=Florida Cracker Horse|publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref>  However, during the [[Dust Bowl]] (1930<U+2013>1940), large western cattle were moved into Florida, bringing with them the parasitic [[screwworm]]. Cattle with this parasite needed to be treated frequently, and Florida Cracker horses, bred for working smaller cattle, were not able to hold the cattle and so were soon replaced by [[American Quarter Horse]]s. This resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct.<ref name=Dutson/> 

===20th century===
[[File:Cracker horse 1.jpg|thumb|Florida Cracker Horse in the Paynes Prairie State Preserve]]
The breed's survival during the 20th century is owed to a few families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive.<ref name=ALBC/> One of these families was that of John Law Ayers. In 1984, Ayers donated his herd of pure-bred Cracker horses to the state of Florida, and with them, the state started three small herds in [[Tallahassee]], [[Withlacoochee State Forest]] and [[Paynes Prairie State Preserve]]. By 1989, however, these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families were all that remained of the breed. In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a [[breed registry|registry]] was established. After the registry was created, 75 horses designated as "[[foundation bloodstock|foundation horses]]" and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered. These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as [[purebred]]s by breed experts <U+2013> partbred horses were denied entry to the registry. As of 2009, around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry.<ref name=Official/>

Effective July 1, 2008, the [[Florida House of Representatives]] declared the Florida Cracker Horse the official state horse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flhouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=37223&SessionId=57|title=CS/CS/HB 131 - State Symbols|accessdate=2010-10-05|publisher=Florida House of Representatives}}</ref> As of 2009 there are three main bloodlines of Cracker stock, as well as a few smaller lines. The state of Florida still maintains two groups of Ayers-line horses in Tallahassee and Withlacoochee for breeding purposes and a display group in the Paynes Prairie Preserve. The state annually sells excess horses from all three herds, and individual breeders also send horses to the sale.<ref name=Official/> The [[American Livestock Breeds Conservancy]] considers the breed to be at "critical" status, as part of the [[Colonial Spanish Horse]] family,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/wtchlist.html#horses|title=Breed Information - ALBC Conservation Priority List|publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2,000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/parameters-livestock.html|title=Parameters of Livestock Breeds on the ALBC Conservation Priority List (2007)|publisher=American Livestock Breeds Conservancy|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> The [[Equus Survival Trust]] also considers the population to be "critical," meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equus-survival-trust.org/documents/equineconservationlist.pdf|title=Equus Survival Trust Equine Conservation List|publisher=Equus Survival Trust|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> However, breed numbers are slowly on the rise.<ref name=Official/>

===Chickasaw horse===
The original Chickasaw horse, bred by the Chickasaw Indians using horses captured from [[Hernando de Soto | De Soto]]'s expedition, went extinct after being used to create the Florida Cracker Horse and having some influence on the Quarter Horse.<ref name=Chickasaw>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickasaw.net/history_culture/index_681.htm|title=Chickasaw Horse|author=Lemon, Holmes Willis|publisher=The Chickasaw Nation|accessdate=2010-12-20}}</ref> Some sources still use the Chickasaw name to describe the Florida Cracker Horses of today.<ref name=Dutson/><ref name=Official/> In the 1970s there was a surge of interest in recreating the Chickasaw using horses bearing strong resemblances to the original breed,<ref name=Chickasaw/> but this has since died out and the breed association that was created appears to no longer exist.
