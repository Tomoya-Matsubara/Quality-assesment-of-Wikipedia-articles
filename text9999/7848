The list of '''Virginia Tech bowl games''' played since the creation of the [[Virginia Tech football|Virginia Tech Hokies football]] team in 1892 consists of 21&nbsp;post-season [[bowl game]]s. Included in those 21&nbsp;games are three [[Bowl Championship Series]] game appearances and one appearance in the [[BCS National Championship Game|national championship game]]. The Hokies have been invited to a bowl game every year since 1993, a 15-year streak that is surpassed only by Michigan (33&nbsp;games), Florida State (26&nbsp;games), and Florida (17&nbsp;games) for active teams.<ref>[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/bowls/current_consecutive.php Current Consecutive Bowl Appearances] College Football Data Warehouse, Accessed [[February 7]], [[2008]].</ref><ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/2007MG/bowl.pdf Orange Bowl Media Guide] Virginia Tech Sports Information, December 2007, Blacksburg, Virginia.

Dozens of [[National Football League]] [[NFL draft|draft picks]] have played for Virginia Tech in bowl games, including two [[List of National Football League first overall draft choices|first-overall selections]]: [[Bruce Smith]] and [[Michael Vick]]. Smith participated in the [[1984 Independence Bowl]], while Vick [[quarterback]]ed the Hokies to their first national championship appearance during the [[2000 Sugar Bowl]], and followed that performance by leading the Hokies to the [[2001 Gator Bowl]], his final collegiate game. Following the game, Vick entered the [[2001 NFL Draft]] and was selected by the [[Atlanta Falcons]].<ref name="Round 1 Atlanta and San Diego">San Diego opted to pass on the No.&nbsp;1 selection, agreeing to a trade with Atlanta Falcons for their No.&nbsp;5 selection.

Two&nbsp;years after its previous trip to the Liberty Bowl, Virginia Tech was again asked to travel to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] to play in a post-season bowl game.

The 1968 Liberty Bowl kicked off on [[January 14]], [[1968]]. As in the Hokies' previous Liberty Bowl appearance, Virginia Tech got off to a fast start. On the game's second play, Tech ran 58&nbsp;yards for a touchdown, courtesy of a trick play. After Mississippi fumbled, Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown. At the end of the first quarter, Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned, making the score 17&ndash;0 at the end of one quarter. From that point onward, however, almost nothing would go in Virginia Tech's favor. Tech attempted an [[onside kick]] following the field goal, but were unable to successfully recover the ball.

Mississippi scored another touchdown before halftime, and the Hokies clung to a 17&ndash;14 lead at the beginning of the second half.

The 1993 Independence Bowl kicked off on [[December 31]], [[1993]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]]. Indiana jumped out to an early lead courtesy of a 75-yard pass from quarterback John Paci. Virginia Tech equalized the score before the first quarter ran out, then took a 14&ndash;7 lead with a second-quarter touchdown run by [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] Joe Swarm. Indiana climbed back with two field goals that cut Tech's lead to 14&ndash;13. With Indiana in possession of the ball and time running down, it appeared that Indiana would have at least one more attempt on offense before halftime. Before the Indiana drive could get moving, John Paci [[fumble]]d the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech and returned 20&nbsp;yards for a touchdown. On Virginia Tech's post-touchdown [[kickoff]], Indiana [[kickoff return|returned]] the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory, setting up a potential field goal by kicker Bill Manolopoulos. During the kick, Virginia Tech defender Jeff Holland broke through the Indiana [[offensive line]] and blocked the field goal attempt.<ref name="1993 indy">[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/bowls/1993Indep.html 1993 Independence Bowl] Virginia Tech Athletics Department, Blacksburg, Virginia.

The two touchdowns gave Virginia Tech a 28&ndash;13 halftime lead, and Indiana never seriously challenged the Hokies afterward.

The 2002 Gator Bowl kicked off on [[January 1]], [[2002]] at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, exactly one year since the Hokies had last played in the game. The game's early going seemed promising for the defense-minded Hokies. In the first quarter, Tech held Florida State scoreless despite only managing a single field goal on offense. In the third quarter, however, Florida State began to find gaps in the Hokie defense and scored 10&nbsp;points. At halftime, Florida State held a 10&ndash;3 lead.<ref name="02 Gator">[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/bowls/2002Gator.html 2002 Gator Bowl] Virginia Tech Athletics department, Hokiesports.com.

In the third quarter, Tech struck back. The Hokies scored 14&nbsp;points in the quarter, while Florida State managed just a field goal. 
The Hokies' All-American tailback [[Lee Suggs]] had suffered a season-ending injury in the first game of the season, but freshman [[Kevin Jones (American football)|Kevin Jones]] had carried the offense for the season, and continued to perform well in the post-season Gator Bowl game. With a 5-yard run from Jones and a 55-yard pass from [[Grant Noel]] to [[Andr<U+00E9> Davis]], Tech took a 17&ndash;13 lead going into the fourth quarter. But the lead quickly evaporated on a 77-yard catch and run from [[Chris Rix]] to [[Javon Walker]].<ref name="02 Gator"/>

Florida State added ten more points after the long touchdown pass, and the Seminoles went on to win the game, 30&ndash;17.<ref>[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/opponents.html?opponent=Florida%20State Virginia Tech Football Opponent History: Florida State] Virginia Tech Athletics department, Hokiesports.com.

The 2002 San Francisco Bowl kicked off on [[December 31]], [[2002]] at [[Pacific Bell Park]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]].

In the second half, defense continued to dominate as Tech built a lead. The Hokies scored the only points of a third quarter as [[running back]] [[Lee Suggs]] ran into the [[end zone]] from one yard out, allowing Tech to take a 17&ndash;10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21-yard field goal. Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance to tie the game and send it into [[overtime]]. Beginning at its own 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory. With seven seconds remaining, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to [[scramble]] into the [[end zone]], but was stopped before the [[goal line]] by Tech [[cornerback]] Ronyell Whitaker. The defensive stop preserved the 20&ndash;13 Hokie victory, and Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's [[most valuable player]].<ref name="02 Sanfran"/>

The 2003 Insight Bowl kicked off on [[December 26]], [[2003]] at [[Bank One Ballpark]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. From the beginning, it was a quick-paced, high-scoring game. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech jumped out to a 21&ndash;7 lead courtesy of the Tech passing game, which saw quarterback [[Bryan Randall]] eventually throw four touchdowns. In the second quarter, California partially recovered from its 14-point first-quarter deficit by scoring two&nbsp;touchdowns.

The 2005 Sugar Bowl kicked off at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on [[January 3]], [[2005]]. The game's early going was marked by defense and field goals. Virginia Tech didn't score in the first half, and Auburn managed just three&nbsp;field goals, including one taken inside the Virginia Tech [[red zone]] after Auburn failed to score a touchdown from the Tech one-yard line. Tech also had a chance to score a touchdown from inside their opponent's one-yard line, but like Auburn, failed to do so. The Hokies elected to try for a touchdown rather than a field goal on [[Down (American football)|fourth down]], but were stopped. At halftime, Auburn had a 9&ndash;0 lead.<ref name="2005 Sugar">[http://www.hokiesports.com/football/bowls/2005Sugar.html 2005 Nokia Sugar Bowl] Virginia Tech athletics department, Hokiesports.com.

In the second half, both teams had more offensive success. Auburn scored the game's first touchdown four and a half minutes into the third quarter, widening the Tigers' lead to 16&ndash;0. Virginia Tech fought back, driving inside the Auburn 10-yard line before settling for a field goal attempt. Kicker Brandon Pace missed the 23-yard field goal try, leaving the score at 16&ndash;0. Tech would have other chances, however. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Tech scored its first points of the game after a six-play, 78-yard drive. A 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryan Randall made the score 16&ndash;6 after a missed [[two-point conversion]]. As time ran down, Tech closed the gap even further. With just over two&nbsp;minutes remaining in the game, Randall connected on an 80-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan for a touchdown. With the score now at 16&ndash;13 and time running out, Tech elected to attempt an [[onside kick]] in hopes of having a chance for a game-winning offensive drive. Auburn recovered the kick, however, and ran out the clock.<ref name="2005 Sugar"/>
