'''Fark.com''' is a [[online community|community]] [[website]] created by [[Drew Curtis]] that allows users to comment on a daily batch of news articles and other items from various websites. As of June 2009, the site boasts approximately 4 million unique visitors per month, which puts it among the top 100 English language websites. The site receives approximately 2,000 story submissions per day, and about 50 of them are displayed on the site.

The site is frequently used as a humorous source for news by major media outlets such as [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]], late night comedy shows like ''[[The Daily Show]]'' or ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', as well as many 
radio stations. Fark does not have any particular bias or underlying ideology, and admins generally enjoy running both [[left-wing politics|far-left]] and [[right-wing politics|far-right]] articles.<ref name="badmouth">{{cite news|url=http://www.badmouth.net/interview-farks-drew-curtis/|title=Interview: Fark<U+2019>s Drew Curtis|last=Marcotte|first=John|date=December 14, 2003|publisher=[http://www.badmouth.net/ www.badmouth.net]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref>

Links are submitted by Fark members (collectively referred to as "Farkers"), which [[Internet forum#moderator|moderator]]s can approve ("greenlight") for posting on either the main page or one of the subsidiary tab pages. All links, whether approved or not, have associated threads where users can comment on the link. Greenlighted links can generate upwards of 300,000 [[page views]] in one month for the recipient, such an enormous amount of [[web traffic|traffic]] that smaller websites are often "[[Slashdot effect|farked]]," meaning that their [[web server|servers]] have crashed.

==History==
Curtis states that the word "fark" originated either from a chat room [[euphemism]] for the word "[[fuck]]" or from a drunken misspelling, although he tells people it's the former because it's a "better story that way."<ref name="Fark FAQ">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/farq/about.shtml|title=Fark Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): About Fark|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> He registered Fark.com in September 1997, when a friend mentioned that all the four letter domain names were disappearing.<ref name="Kawasaki">{{cite web|url=http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/02/panel_of_web_co.html|title=Panel of Web Community Founders: Utter Defiance of the "Venture Capital" Model|last=Kawasaki|first=Guy|date=February 22, 2007|publisher=''[http://blog.guykawasaki.com/ blog.guykawasaki.com/]''|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> Originally, Fark contained no content except for an image of a [[squirrel]] with large [[testicles]]. This photograph is that of a [[Cape Ground Squirrel]] in [[Etosha National Park]], [[Namibia]], taken by photographer Kevin Shafer working for the [[Corbis|Corbis Corporation]], ca. 1993.<ref name="squirrel_cite">{{cite web|url=http://pro.corbis.com/Enlargement/Enlargement.aspx?id=AF004534&ext=1|title=Cape Ground Squirrel with Large Testicles|last=Shafer|first=Kevin|date=ca. 1993|publisher=[[Corbis]]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref>

Since 1993, Curtis had frequently read morning news stories and exchanged them with friends.<ref name=biz20>{{cite news|last=Sloan|first=Paul|title=Blogging for Dollars|publisher=''[[CNN]]''|date=October 2, 2006|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/09/01/8384325/|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}</ref> Although this would later become the inspiration for Fark, Curtis toyed with the idea of starting an online [[curry]] recipe [[database]].<ref name="Kawasaki"/> In 1999, eighteen months after registering the domain name, he launched Fark as a way to share interesting news postings with his friends rather than sending them numerous emails.<ref name="takahashi">{{cite news|url=http://bizsnacks.blogspot.com/2008/06/takahashi-three-who-had-right-idea-at.html|title=Takahashi: Three who had the right idea at the right time |last=Takahashi|first=Dean|date=January 1, 2008|publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> The first story posted was an article about a [[fighter pilot]] who crashed while attempting to moon another fighter pilot.<ref name="Kawasaki"/>

In Fark's first year, it received 50,000 page views, and 1 million the year after.<ref name="farkbook">{{cite book |last=Curtis|first=Drew |title=It's Not News, It's Fark: How Mass Media Tries to Pass Off Crap as News |publisher= Gotham Books |year=2007 |isbn=978159240366}}</ref> Features such as link submission and forums were added as popularity and participation grew. By January 2008, according to Curtis, the site received an estimated 52 million page views per month from 4 million unique visitors.<ref name="takahashi"/> Fark was officially incorporated in the state of [[Delaware]] as, "Fark, Inc.", on January 31, 2008.<ref name="Fark, Inc.">"[https://sos-res.state.de.us/tin/controller Fark, Inc. (File Number: 4490837)]." ''[[Delaware|State of Delaware]].'' Retrieved on June 12, 2009.</ref>

While most of the story links on the main page are submitted by users and selected for placement based on merit, there was an incident in August 2004 in which Fark was accused of selling preferential placement of story links on the main page. The accusation stemmed from an exchange between [[Mahalo.com]] [[CEO]] [[Jason Calacanis]] and third party sales employee Gogi Gupta, where Gupta claimed Calacanis could buy an editorial on Fark for $300 to $400.<ref name="calacanis">{{cite news|url=http://calacanis.com/2004/08/02/fark-com-sells-their-editorial-and-the-loyalty-of-their-users/|title=Fark.com sells their editorial, and the loyalty of their users.|last=Calacanis|first=Jason|date=August 2, 2004|publisher=''[http://www.calacanis.com/ www.calacanis.com]''|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref> Curtis dismissed the incident as the result of an overenthusiastic [[sales]]person, and subsequently fired Gupta.<ref name="wired">{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/08/64472|title=Fark Sells Out.

On January 17, 2007, Fark launched Fark TV.<ref name="FarkTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/17/fark-tv-debuts-meth-.html|title=Fark TV debuts.

On April 25, 2007, a new design for the website was launched with the comment, "Fark site redesign is now live. Hope nothing breaks, we're all out drinking."<ref name="fark_redesign">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=2762299#c29867598|title=Fark site redesign is now live. Hope nothing breaks, we're all out drinking.|date=April 25, 2007|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> The new design was initially received with some controversy by many users, mostly due to the change in layout and a seemingly indifferent attitude by site moderators to user impact or feedback. In response, Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign: "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise you end up with a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The old design was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof. It was time to reformat and remove a bunch of the clutter while trying to keep the core design intact."<ref name="curtis_redesign">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=2765382|title=Fark redesign notes and updates from Drew.|last=Curtis|first=Drew|date=April 26, 2007|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> The site layout was refined over the next few weeks in accordance with many suggestions.

In May 2007, Curtis published the book, ''[[It's Not News, It's FARK|It's Not News, It's Fark: How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News]]''. The book critically explores the [[mass media]] industry and the go-to stories used when there is a lack of hard news to report.<ref name="farkbook"/> The book sold 25,000 copies in its first 12 weeks on the market.<ref name="meetinnovators">{{cite news|url=http://meetinnovators.com/2007/10/18/drew-curtis-from-fark/|title=Drew Curtis from Fark|last=Bye|first=Adrian|publisher=[http://meetinnovators.com/ Adrian Bye's meetinnovators]|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref> Despite its initial strong reception, the book only received mild attention from reviewers. ''[[Salon.com]]'' gave it a favorable review, although the only major [[newspaper]] to review it was the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'', which only gave it a mini-review.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2175244/pagenum/all/|title=Fark Founder Flattens Fourth Estate|last=Shafer|first=Jack|date=October 4, 2007|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref>

==Administration==
Compared to other popular websites, such as [[Daily Kos]] and [[Delicious (website)|del.icio.us]], Fark is a relatively small operation, run more or less singlehandedly by founder [[Drew Curtis]] from his home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref name="ingram">{{cite web|url=http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2006/08/22/forget-digg-what-about-fark/|title=Forget Digg, what about Fark?|last=Ingram|first=Matthew|date=August 22, 2006|publisher=[http://www.mathewingram.com/ matthewingram.com]|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}</ref> The site earns revenue from [[internet marketing|advertising]] and membership in its TotalFark program.<ref name="npr">{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10009173|title=Fark.com: Making Money Off of Goofy News|date=May 7, 2007|publisher=[[NPR]] (''[[All Things Considered]]'')|accessdate=June 12, 2009}}</ref> Although Curtis won't release official revenue figures, he estimated that, in 2006, the site earned just under $600,000 per year.<ref name=biz20/> Its [[classifieds]] section alone generates as much as $40,000 per year.<ref name="npr"/> Technology writer Mathew Ingram described Fark.com as "staggeringly successful" and noted the disparity between Fark's revenue and the amount of press given to sites like [[Digg]].<ref name="ingram"/> Fark has also spoken about its steady, above average [[Cost per impression|CPMs]].

Despite a fairly high revenue, Drew takes a yearly salary of just $60,000.<ref name="npr"/> The rest of the money goes to the site's legal, "war chest", as well as to pay other expenses, such as hosting, website design, and forum moderation.<ref name="npr"/> Additionally, Fark has been known to turn down advertising that interrupts the user experience, such as [[pop-up ad|pop ups]] or ads with sound.

Curtis has used public relations to drive traffic, including interviews every Friday on [[TechTV]] for one to one and a half years (ca. 2002-2003) about the three weirdest tech-oriented stories of the week.<ref name="meetinnovators"/>

==Features==
===Tags===
Submitters can give stories several different [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] such as ''stupid'', ''interesting'', ''obvious'', or ''dumbass''. Tags that say ''photoshop'', ''audioedit'' or ''videoedit'' are used for threads where digital content is edited for a humorous or artistic effect. In addition, the ''newsflash'' tag is used for news which is a matter of important breaking news, and an email is sent to the administrators notifying them that someone has submitted a ''Newsflash''.

Due to the large amount of headlines submitted to the site from the state of [[Florida]], and because "so many stupid things happen in Florida, it deserved its own Fark tag." So the ''Florida'' tag was created at the suggestion of users.<ref name="FL_tag">{{cite news|url=http://www2.tbo.com/content/2007/aug/09/na-florida-seen-as-fiesta-of-weirdness/|title=Florida Seen As 'Fiesta Of Weirdness'|date=August 9, 2007|publisher=''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref><ref name="stpetetimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/06/03/Floridian/Gathering_to_embrace_.shtml|title=Gathering to embrace the power of the Fark Side|last=Cridlin|first=Jay|date=June 3, 2005|publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref> Similarly, articles discussing [[Wil Wheaton]] &mdash; a Fark user himself<ref name="wheaton">{{cite web|url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/wil_wheaton/biography.php|title=Wil Wheaton / Biography|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2009-06-26}}</ref> &mdash; are given the ''Wheaton'' tag and articles discussing [[Christopher Walken]] are occasionally given the ''Walken'' tag, though Walken has never participated on Fark.

On August 19, 2008, a new ''[[FAIL#Fail_Internet_meme|fail]]'' tag was introduced, to be used for submitted articles where the subject does something ignorant or when a major gaffe occurs.<ref name="failtag">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=3813171|title=Step 1: Fill dozens of balloons.

===TotalFark===
In February 2002, Drew Curtis introduced TotalFark as a [[Subscription business model|subscription service]], charging [[United States Dollar|$]]5 per month.<ref name="totalfark_farq">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/farq/totalfark.shtml|title=Fark Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): TotalFark Only Questions|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref> By May 2007, there were an estimated 2000 subscribers, generating $120,000 per year.<ref name="npr"/> Subscribers, known collectively as TotalFarkers, or TFers, have the privilege of seeing and commenting on all links submitted to the site, as opposed to only those approved for inclusion on the main page.<ref name="totalfark_farq"/> In a typical 24-hour period, TotalFark's main page includes 2,600 links with associated comment threads, whereas Fark's main page includes only 60 to 80 links from among this number.

Subscribers that purchase a 6 or 12 month subscription are also eligible to receive an ''@ultrafark.com'' email address. The UltraFark email service is provided through [[Google]]'s [[Gmail]] service.<ref name="ultrafark">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/farq/ufemails.shtml|title=Fark Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): UltraFark Email Questions|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}</ref>

Fark's comment threads are often littered with various ''Farkisms'' or ''clich<U+00E9>s''. These are essentially [[in-joke]]s which either originated on Fark.com or on other [[blog]]s (such as [[4chan]] or [[Something Awful]]) that have become an integral part of the community culture and used in myriad discussions at the website, regardless of whether they apply to the topic at hand.<ref name="farkisms">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/farq/farkisms.shtml|title=Fark Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Farkisms|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> Several groups of people seem to take a bit more abuse than others on the site, including [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], [[Holy Orders|Catholic priests]], the [[French people|French]], and [[Duke University]], according to Curtis.<ref name="top4groups">{{cite news|url=http://www.newmoanyeah.com/2003-features/120103_interview_with_drew_curtis.php?content=2003&section=features&title=120103_interview_with_drew_curtis&vo=83|title=Interview with Drew Curtis, FARKin' Genius|last=Why|first=Joel|date=December 1, 2003|publisher=''[http://www.newmoanyeah.com/ www.newmoanyeah.com]''|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref>

One particularly notable Farkism involves the acronym ''UFIA'' (Unsolicited Finger in the Anus), which became a clich<U+00E9> after an article making the main page misquoted a judge using the line.<ref name="ufia">{{cite news|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=869740|title=Judge determines unsolicited finger in anus is crude, but not criminal.|date=March 12, 2004|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> UFIA was prominently used again in February 2005, when Drew Curtis purchased the naming rights to the Fleet Center (now [[TD Garden]]) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] for the single day of February 28, 2005. The consensus choice of Fark.com's readers was that it should be re-dubbed the, <U+201C>Fark.com UFIA Center.<U+201D> In the end, however, [[Boston Garden]] was chosen as the name due to [[obscenity]] concerns.<ref name="UFIA_CNN">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0502/18/lad.02.html|title=Georgia Lawmakers Weigh in on Childhood Obesity; Fancy Freebies; Boston's FleetCenter Auctioned Single-Day Naming Rights on eBay.|last=Wallace|first=Kelly|date=February 18, 2005|publisher=''[[CNN]]''|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}</ref> In April 2006, a Fark member convinced the [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]] to erect an [[Adopt a Highway]] sign in the name of UFIA on the two miles of [[List of Tennessee state highways#State Routes 1 through 100|State Route 63]] west of the intersection of SR 63 and [[U.S. Route 25E]]. The Department required a definition of UFIA, which was explained as, <U+201C>Uniting Friends in America.<U+201D><ref name="uniting_friends_in_america">{{cite news|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=1993763|title=It's official.

===Photoshop contests===
The site features regular [[Photoshop contest]]s, in which users use a graphical editing program (such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], from which the contest draws its name) to manipulate an image provided by the creator of the contest. The image is usually manipulated for humorous effect, but can also be edited to create an aesthetically-pleasing image or to showcase a poster's image manipulation skill.<ref name="photoshop">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/farq/photoshop.shtml|title=Fark Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Photoshop Contests|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref> A similar site, [[Something Awful]], sponsors Photoshop Phriday contests, and there is usually some friendly competition among users of the two sites.<ref name="photoshop_phriday">{{cite web|url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/photoshop-phriday/|title=Photoshop Phriday|publisher=[[Something Awful]]|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref>

===Fark Parties===
At periodic intervals throughout the year, Fark Parties are organized, usually in conjunction with the travels of founder, Drew Curtis. The practice began in 1999, when Curtis was doing some database consulting in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]], staying in a hotel with nothing to do. So he posted a note up on the site asking if anybody that lives in the area wanted to grab a beer, to give him an email.<ref name="stpetetimes"/>

===Foobies===
In 2006, Curtis launched Foobies as a [[NSFW]] (not safe for work) offshoot of Fark. Curtis sells NSFW links through Foobies at a price of $400.<ref name="calacanis"/><ref name="foobies">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/farq/about.shtml#What_is_Foobies.3F|title=Fark Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): About Fark (What is Foobies?)|last=Curtis|first=Drew|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}</ref>

==Traffic and users==

As of June 2009, the site receives approximately 4 million unique visitors per month,<ref name="poynter">{{cite news|url=http://www.poynter.org/column.asp?id=67&aid=165392|title=Archived Chat: Frat House Meets Debate Club When It's News and It's Fark|last=McBride|first=Kelly|date=June 22, 2009|publisher=[[The Poynter Institute for Media Studies]]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> which puts it in the top 100 of English language websites.<ref name="lex">{{cite news |last=Silcoff |first=Mireille |title=LYPA Rising Stars |publisher=Lexington Weekly |date= |url=http://www.lexweekly.com/Articles-c-2008-05-29-76799.113117_LYPA_Rising_Stars.html |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> Fark.com's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa rating]] is 3,170, with the average user spending 5.8 minutes per day on the site and 4,636 sites linking in. 70% of users originate from the [[United States]].<ref name="alexa">{{cite web|url=http://alexa.com/siteinfo/fark.com|title=Alexa information for Fark.com|publisher=[[Alexa Internet]]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> The site receives approximately 2,000 story submissions per day from users, and about 50 of them are displayed on the main page of the site, or "green-lighted".<ref name="badmouth"/> Subscribers to the subscription ''TotalFark'' service, are able to view all 2,000 submissions per day for a $5 per month fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/totalfarksignup.pl|title=TotalFark Signup|publisher=[[Fark.com]]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> There are around 500,000 user accounts on the site (''TotalFark'' and unpaid accounts), although only about 5% actually read comments, and only 1% actually post in the forums.<ref name="poynter"/> Greenlit links can generate upwards of 300,000 [[page views]] in one month for the recipient,<ref name="pluginhq">{{cite news|url=http://www.pluginhq.com/definitive-guide-to-fark/|title=Definitive Guide to Fark and Getting Mass Traffic|last=Allsopp|first=Glen|date=June 16, 2008|publisher=[http://www.pluginhq.com/ www.pluginhq.com]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> which is such an enormous amount of [[web traffic|traffic]] that smaller websites are often "[[Slashdot effect|farked]]," meaning that their [[web server|servers]] have crashed.

Normally, in the absence of serious news, comments in the forums on the site tend to be of a more sophomoric nature, consisting primarily of sex jokes and comments about various bodily functions. However, during major events, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] or the [[Hurricane Katrina]] aftermath, usage spikes and the site can actually be seen as a more serious outlet for news.<ref name="poynter"/> Some users can also contribute greatly to reporting actual events, such as Farker Tatsuma,<ref name="tatsuma">{{cite web|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/users.pl?login=Tatsuma|title=Fark Profile: Tatsuma|date=March 20, 2004|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> whose detailed coverage and [[citizen journalism]] of the events during the [[2009 Iranian election protests]] was recognized by several major media outlets.<ref name="poynter"/><ref name="fark_tatsuma">{{cite news|url=http://www.fark.com/cgi/comments.pl?IDLink=4459645|title=Farker Tatsuma gets props from journalists for his work on covering the brouhaha in Iran|date=June 20, 2009|publisher=Fark.com|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}</ref> In response to this coverage, Drew Curtis placed a green band on the letter "K" in the site's logo at the top of the page, to show support for the Iranian protesters.<ref name="anonIran">{{cite web|url=http://iran.whyweprotest.net/promote-cause/973-fark-goes-green-iran.html|title=FARK goes green for Iran|date=June 18, 2009|publisher=''[http://iran.whyweprotest.net/ Anonymous Iran]''|accessdate=July 5, 2009}}<!-- This really needs a better cite that better meets the [[WP:RS]] criteria; but for now, it does back up the statement regarding the green band. --></ref>

In a June 2009 interview, Drew Curtis admitted that Fark's voting system is highly susceptible to [[internet spam|spammers]]. In fact, he noticed that almost all traffic coming from the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[India]] was from spammers, so he blocked both countries from the site.<ref name="china-india-blocked">{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethewebb.com/2009/06/interview-with-genius-behind-fark-drew-curtis/|title=Interview with the Genius Behind Fark, Drew Curtis|date=June 29, 2009|publisher=''[http://www.insidethewebb.com/ www.insidethewebb.com]''|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref>
