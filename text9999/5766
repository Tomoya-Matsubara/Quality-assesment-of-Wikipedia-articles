'''Kruj<U+00EB>''' ({{lang-sq-definite|Kruja}}) is a town in north-central [[Albania]] and the capital of the municipality and the [[District of Kruj<U+00EB>]]. It has a population of about 15,900. 

== Name ==
The name of the city is related with the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] word ''kroi'' meaning fountain. In [[Albanian language|Albanian]] the city is known as ''Kruj<U+00EB>'' or ''Kruja''. In [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] documents of the early 7th century it has been attested as ''Kroai'', while in medieval [[Latin language|Latin]] it was known as ''Croia'', ''Croya'' and ''Croarum''. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era it was also known as ''Ak Hisar'' or ''Ak<U+00E7>ahisar'' from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words ''ak'' (white) and ''hisar'' (castle).<ref>Elsie p.294</ref>

== Geography ==
Kruj<U+00EB> is located at an altitude of 600 m (1,969 ft) on the foot of Mount Kruj<U+00EB> ({{lang-sq|Mali i Kruj<U+00EB>s}}) of the Kruj<U+00EB> Gorge, while south and west of the town is found the plain of the [[Ish<U+00EB>m River]].<ref name="gibb"/> 
The closest to Kruj<U+00EB> cities are [[Tiran<U+00EB>]] and [[Durr<U+00EB>s]] at a distance of 20 and 37 km respectively.

==History==
=== Medieval ===
[[File:Skandeberginkruja.jpg|thumb|200px|The citadel of Kruj<U+00EB> during the middle ages]]
Early medieval artifacts of Kruj<U+00EB> include dress items and weaponry found in fifth and sixth century cemeteries, which display the high status and the wealth of the burials. Originally a middle-sized [[Kruj<U+00EB> Castle|fortress]] like other urban centers of Kruj<U+00EB> expanded to a town probably from the sixth to the ninth century AD.<ref>Spieser p.55-7</ref> In 1190 Kruj<U+00EB> became the capital of the first autonomous Albanian state of the middle ages, the [[Principality of Arb<U+00EB>r]] founded by [[Progon, Prince of Albania|Progon]] of the [[House of Progon]].<ref>Norris p.35</ref> During the reign of [[Gulam of Albania]] the principality was dissolved and incorporated in the newly founded [[Kingdom of Albania]] and later by the House of Thopia. After 1389 it became the capital of the [[Principality of Kastrioti]] under [[Gjon Kastrioti]], father of the national hero of the Albanians [[Skanderbeg]]. In 1395 the town was briefly captured by the [[Ottoman Empire]], while from 1410 to 1415 it was ruled by Nikit<U+00EB> Thopia.<ref name="Norris1993">Norris p.141</ref>

In the early 15th century the city was conquered again by the Ottoman Empire and then recaptured in 1443 by Skanderbeg, who in 1438 had been appointed ''subasi'' (governor) of Kruj<U+00EB>.<ref name="Norris1993"/> In 1444 Skanderbeg incorporated it in the [[League of Lezh<U+00EB>]], the confederation of the [[Albanian principalities]]. From 1450 until 1477 Kruj<U+00EB> was defended successfully by the Albanian troops four times against the Ottoman army, which eventually captured it in 1478 during the [[Fourth Siege of Kruj<U+00EB>|fourth Siege of the city]]. In the [[First Siege of Kruj<U+00EB>|first siege of Kruj<U+00EB>]] in 1450 the 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers of the [[League of Lezh<U+00EB>]] under [[Vrana Konti]] and Skanderbeg defeated an Ottoman force of about 100,000 men led by Sultan [[Murad II]], who during the siege tried to bribe Konti to surrender the castle of the town. In the following decade Kruj<U+00EB> was first besieged in [[Second Siege of Kruj<U+00EB>|1466]] and then in [[Third Siege of Kruj<U+00EB>|1467]] unsuccessfully by [[Ballaban Pasha]] and Sultan [[Mehmed II]], whose total troops were about 150,000. After Skanderbeg's death in 1468 in the city's garrison were added troops of the [[Republic of Venice]]. In 1476 the town was once more besieged by a ten-thousand-man army under [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]], however, the local garrison led by [[proveditor]] Pietro Vetturi fended off the Ottoman besiegers, who retreated after the arrival of reinforcements under Francesco Contarini and Nikoll<U+00EB> Dukagjini. The city was eventually conquered by the Ottomans in 1478 after being besieged for over a year.<ref>Jaques p.549</ref>

=== Modern ===
During the rise [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire]] Kruj<U+00EB> became the battlefield of various anti-Ottoman rebellions also related with the imposition of new taxes. In 1906 the people of Kruj<U+00EB> revolted once more against the Ottoman empire.<ref name="gibb">Gibb p.285</ref> The [[W<U+0101>li]] of [[Shkod<U+00EB>r]], Sali Zeki Pasha sent four battalions of the Ottoman army stationed in the city against the rebels of Kruj<U+00EB>. After prolonged confrontations the Ottoman officials offered to begin negotiations with the rebels. On September 20, 1906 the leaders of Kruj<U+00EB> and the Ottoman diplomats met at the Tallajbe quarter of Kruj<U+00EB> to discuss the administrative status of the town, however, the Ottoman army under <U+015E>emsi Pasha ambushed the rebel leaders.<ref name="ash">History of the Albanian People p.450-70</ref> During the battle that followed, which became known in history after the Tallajbe district, about 30 people died including uninvolved civilians.<ref name="gibb"/><ref name="ash"/>

Throughout the [[Albanian Revolt of 1912]], that led to the creation of the [[Albanian Vilayet]] and later in the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence of Albania]] Kruj<U+00EB>, which was captured on August 14, was one of the major anti-Ottoman centers.<ref name="pearsona">Pearson vol.1 p.27</ref> In 1914 [[Essad Toptani]], a member of the notable Toptani family of the region and officer of the Ottoman army, captured the town and incorporated it in the [[Republic of Central Albania]] making it a center of his movement, but in June of the same year it was reincorporated by [[Pr<U+00EA>nk Bib<U+00EB> Doda]] in the [[Principality of Albania]].<ref>Pearson vol.1 p.71</ref><ref name="gibb"/> On December 20, 1914 the local anti-Essadist led by [[Abdi Toptani]], Minister of Finance of Albania and cousin of Essad Toptani, and Mehmet Gjinali, Union of Kruj<U+00EB> was formed, which quickly extended its authority in central Albania.<ref name="pearsona"/><ref>Pearson vol.1 p.84</ref>

Following the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]  the country became a [[protectorate]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. [[Mustafa Merlika-Kruja]], a native of Kruj<U+00EB>, who became the Prime Minister of the new regime ordered the formation of a 300-man gendarmerie force to defend the town against resistance groups. However, soon after resistance leader [[Abaz Kupi]], another native of the town, created one of the first permanent resistance forces of Albania in Kruj<U+00EB> and gradually took control of the region.<ref>Fischer p.111</ref> In 1943 at the assembly of Tapiz<U+00EB> [[Balli Komb<U+00EB>tar]] proposed to the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|LN<U+00C7>]] the creation of provisional resistance government, with Kruj<U+00EB> as the capital city, but this proposal was rejected by the LN<U+00C7> leaders.<ref>Fischer p.150</ref> In the end of November 1944, the last German troops stationed in the area were defeated and LN<U+00C7> battalions entered the town.

== Culture ==
In antiquity Kruj<U+00EB> was a site used for [[Paleo-Balkan mythology|pagan rituals]], while after the spread of Christianity a church dedicated to [[Pope Alexander I|Saint Alexander]] was built near Mount Kruj<U+00EB>. In the Ottoman era in the area of the church a [[cemevi|tekke]] dedicated to the [[Bektashi]] saint [[Sari Saltik]] was built.<ref>Norris p.157</ref>
In 1789-99 the Dollma tekke was built by the Dollma family near the castle. The museums of Kruj<U+00EB> include the [[Skanderbeg Museum|Skanderbeg museum]] and the national ethnographic museum. The Skanderbeg museum, founded in 1982, was built in the environs of the [[Kruj<U+00EB> castle]]. Its collection includes mostly 15th century artifacts related to the Albanian-Ottoman wars, during which the castle was besieged four times by the Ottoman army.<ref name="nat">N.A.T</ref> The national ethnographic museum of Kruj<U+00EB> was founded in 1989 and is located in a 15-6 room villa of the Toptani family built in 1764. The main exhibits of the museum are objects of artisanship, whose age varies from 60 to 500 years.<ref name="nat"/>
