The '''Western Jackdaw''' (''Corvus monedula''), sometimes known as the '''Eurasian Jackdaw''', '''European Jackdaw''' or simply '''Jackdaw''', is a [[passerine]] bird in the [[Corvidae|crow family]]. Found across Europe, western Asia and North Africa, it is mostly [[Bird migration|resident]], although northern and eastern populations [[Bird migration|migrate]] south in winter. Four [[subspecies]] are recognised, which mainly differ in the colouration of the [[plumage]] on the head and nape. [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] first [[Species description|described]] it formally, giving it the name ''Corvus monedula''. Later [[Genetic testing|analysis of its DNA]] shows that, with its closest relative the [[Daurian Jackdaw]], it is an early offshoot from the genus ''[[Corvus (genus)|Corvus]]'', and possibly distinct enough to warrant reclassification in a separate genus, ''[[Coloeus]]''. The common name derives from the word "jack", meaning "small", and "daw", the native English name for the bird.

Measuring {{convert|34|<U+2013>|39|cm|in}} in length, the Western Jackdaw is a black-plumaged bird with a grey [[nape]] and distinctive pale-grey [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]]. It is [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] and vocal, living in small groups with a complex social structure in farmland, open woodland, on coastal cliffs, and in urban settings. An [[omnivore|omnivorous]] and opportunistic feeder, it eats a wide variety of plant material and [[invertebrate]]s, as well as food waste from urban areas. Western Jackdaws are [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamous]] and build simple nests of sticks in cavities in trees, cliffs, or buildings. About five pale blue or blue-green eggs with brown speckles are laid and incubated by the female. The young then fledge in four to five weeks.

== Taxonomy ==
The Western Jackdaw was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

===Etymology===
The common name ''jackdaw'' first appeared in the 16th century, and is thought to be a compound of the forename ''Jack'', used in animal names to signify a small form (e.g. [[Jack Snipe]]), and the native English word ''daw''. Formerly, Western Jackdaws were simply called "daws".<ref name=Good78>Goodwin, p. 78</ref> The metallic ''chyak'' call may be the origin of the ''jack'' part of the common name,<ref name="British Garden Birds: Jackdaw">{{cite web |url=http://www.garden-birds.co.uk/birds/jackdaw.htm |title=British Garden Birds: Jackdaw|author=Gains, David|date=1 July 2010|accessdate=27 April 2012|publisher=self}}</ref> but this is not supported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopaedia |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50122724 |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|title=Jackdaw, ''n.''|edition= 2nd |year=1989}}</ref> ''Daw'', first used for the bird in the 15th century, is held by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' to be derived from the postulated [[Old English]] ''dawe'', citing the [[cognate]]s in [[Old High German]] ''t<U+0101>ha'', [[Middle High German]] ''t<U+0101>he'' or ''t<U+0101>chele'', and modern German ''Dahle'' or ''Dohle'', and dialectal ''Tach, D<U+00E4>hi, D<U+00E4>che'' and ''Dacha''.
The original Old English word ''c<U+0113>o'' (pronounced with initial ''ch'') gave modern English "[[chough]]"; [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] sometimes used this word to refer to the Western Jackdaw,<ref name=Good78/> as did [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] in ''[[Hamlet]]'' although there has been debate about which species he was referring to.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shakespeare, William; Edwards, Philip|title=Hamlet, Prince of Denmark | publisher= Cambridge University  Press |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|year=2003|page=241|isbn=0-521-53252-3}}</ref> This [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] name, based on the Western Jackdaw's call, now refers to corvids of the genus ''[[Pyrrhocorax]]''; the [[Red-billed Chough]] (''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax''), formerly particularly common in Cornwall, became known initially as the "Cornish Chough" and then just the "Chough", the name transferring from one species to the other.<ref name= Cocker >{{cite book | last = Cocker | first = Mark | coauthors= Mabey, Richard  |title = Birds Britannica | year = 2005 |location=London, United Kingdom | publisher = Chatto & Windus | isbn = 0-7011-6907-9|pages= 406<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Names in English dialects are numerous. Scottish and north English dialects have included ''ka'' or ''kae'' since the 14th century. The [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] form of this word was ''co'' or ''coo''. ''Caddow'' is potentially a compound of ''ka'' and ''dow'', a variant of ''daw''. Other dialectal or obsolete names include ''caddesse'', ''cawdaw'', ''caddy'', ''chauk'', ''college-bird''<!--(from dialectal ''college'' "cathedral")-- difficult to understand this-->, ''jackerdaw'', ''jacko'', ''ka-wattie'', ''chimney-sweep bird'' (from their nesting propensities), and ''sea-crow'' (from the frequency with which they are found on coasts).

Immature birds have duller and less demarcated plumage.<ref name=cramp121/> The head is a sooty black, sometimes with a faint greenish sheen and brown feather bases visible; the back and side of the neck are dark grey and the underparts greyish or sooty black. The tail has narrower feathers and a greenish sheen.<ref name=cramp137/>

There is very little geographic variation in size. The main differences are the presence or absence of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in the shade of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.<ref name=cramp139/><!-- cites para -->

A skilled flyer, the Western Jackdaw can manoeuvre tightly as well as tumble and glide. It has characteristic jerky wing beats when flying, though these are not evident when birds are [[bird migration|migrating]].<ref name=cramp121/> [[Wind tunnel]] experiments show that the preferred gliding speed is between {{convert|6|and|11|m}} per second and that the wingspan decreases as the bird flies faster.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rosen, Mikael; Hedenstrom, Anders |year=2001|title= Gliding Flight in a Jackdaw: A Wind Tunnel Study|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=204|issue=6|pages=1153<U+2013>66 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/204/6/1153.full.pdf}}</ref> On the ground, Western Jackdaws have an upright posture and strut briskly, their short legs giving them a rapid gait.

Within its range, the Western Jackdaw is unmistakable; its short bill and grey nape are distinguishing features. From a distance, it can be confused with a [[Rook (bird)|Rook]] (''Corvus frugilegus''), or when in flight, with a [[pigeon]] or [[chough]].<ref name=cramp121>Cramp (1994), p. 121.</ref> Flying Western Jackdaws are distinguishable from other corvids by their smaller size, faster and deeper wingbeats and proportionately narrower and less fingered wing tips.

=== Voice ===
Western Jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, frequently given in flight, is a metallic and squeaky ''chyak-chyak'' or ''kak-kak''.<ref name="Svensson" /> This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as ''kiaw'' or ''kyow''. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as ''kyaay'', ''tchaayk'' or ''giaaaa''.<ref name=cramp133>Cramp (1994), p. 133.</ref> Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western Jackdaws also have a hoarse, drawn-out [[alarm call]],<ref name="Svensson" /> ''arrrrr'' or ''kaaaarr'', used when warning of predators or when mobbing them.<ref name=cramp133/> Nestlings begin making a soft ''cheep'' at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens.<ref name=cramp134>Cramp (1994), p. 134.</ref> From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear an unfamiliar noise.<ref name=cramp132/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Western Jackdaw is found from north-west Africa through all of Europe, except for the extreme north, and eastwards through [[central Asia]] to the eastern [[Himalayas]] and Lake Baikal. To the east, it occurs throughout Turkey, the [[Caucasus]], Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and north-west India.<ref name="Good75"/>  However, it is regionally extinct in Malta and Tunisia.<ref name=iucn>{{IUCN|version=2011.1|assessors=BirdLife International|year=2009|id=146641|title=''Corvus monedula''|downloaded=1 August 2011}}</ref> The range is vast, with an estimated global extent of between 1 million and 10 million square kilometres (4 hundred thousand to 4 million square miles).

In his book ''[[King Solomon's Ring (nonfiction)|King Solomon's Ring]]'', [[Konrad Lorenz]] described and analysed the complex social interactions in a Western Jackdaw flock that lived around his house in [[Sankt Andr<U+00E4>-W<U+00F6>rdern|Altenberg]], Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual [[Bird migration|migration]].

Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last to have access to food and shelter.<ref name="Lorenz 1964"/> Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the Western Jackdaws in the flock.<ref name="Lorenz 1964"/>

===Social displays===
Social hierarchy in Western Jackdaw flocks is determined by supplanting, fighting, and [[threat display]]s<U+2014>several of which have been described. In the ''bill-up posture'', the Western Jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and assertiveness, the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A ''bill-down posture'' is another commonly used [[agonistic behaviour]]. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western Jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the ''forward-threat posture'', a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females.<ref name=cramp130>Cramp (1994), p. 130.</ref><!-- cites all previous --> In the ''defensive-threat posture'', the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. ''Supplanting'' is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western Jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.<ref name=cramp131>Cramp (1994), p. 131.</ref><!-- cites previous five sentences -->

Western Jackdaws entreat their partners to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers. Birds mainly preen each others' head and neck. Known as ''allopreening'', this behaviour is almost always done between birds of a mated pair.<ref name=cramp131/>

===Feeding===
[[File:Corvus monedula 009.jpg|thumb|Subspecies ''soemmerringii'', foraging in pasture in Russia]]
Foraging takes place in open areas and on the ground, but Western Jackdaws do take some food in trees.<ref name="Good75"/> [[Landfill|Rubbish tips]], bins, urban streets, and gardens are also visited, more often early in the morning when there are fewer people about.<ref name="Good75"/> Various feeding methods are employed, such as jumping, pecking, clod-turning and scattering, probing the soil, and occasionally, digging. [[Fly|Flies]] around [[Cow dung|cow pats]] are caught by jumping from the ground or at times by dropping vertically from a few metres onto the cow pat. [[Earthworm]]s are not usually extracted from the ground by Western Jackdaws but are eaten from freshly ploughed soil.<ref name =lockie/> Jackdaws will ride on the backs of sheep and other mammals, seeking [[tick]]s as well as actively gathering wool or hair for nests, and will catch flying ants in flight.<ref name = madge/> Compared with other corvids, the Western Jackdaw spends more time exploring and turning over objects with its bill; it also has a straighter and less downturned bill and increased binocular vision which are advantageous for this foraging strategy.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kulemeyer |first=Christoph |last2=Asbahr|first2=Kolja|last3=Gunz|first3=Philipp|last4=Frahnert|first4=Sylke|last5=Bairlein|first5=Franz |year=2009 |title=Functional Morphology and Integration of Corvid Skulls&nbsp;<U+2013> a 3D Geometric Morphometric Approach |journal=Frontiers in Zoology|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/2|doi=10.1186/1742-9994-6-2 |pages=2}}</ref>

Western Jackdaws practice active food sharing&nbsp;<U+2013> where the initiative for the transfer lies with the donor&nbsp;<U+2013> with a number of individuals, regardless of sex or kinship.

Western Jackdaws usually breed in [[Bird colony|colonies]] with pairs collaborating to find a nest site, which they then defend from other pairs and predators during most of the year.<ref name="emery" /> They nest in cavities in trees or cliffs, in ruined or occupied buildings and in chimneys, the common feature being a sheltered site for the nest.

===Parasites and diseases===
Western Jackdaws have learned to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after delivery by the milkman. The bacterium ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'' has been isolated from their beaks and [[cloaca]]e so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of ''Campylobacter'' [[gastroenteritis]] in [[Gateshead]] in northeast England <ref>{{cite doi |10.1016/0140-6736(90)91162-4}}</ref> and led the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1016/0140-6736(91)92541-9}}</ref>

An outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans has been linked to Western Jackdaws. During a [[Autopsy|post-mortem]] on an affected bird, a [[Polyomaviridae|polyomavirus]] was isolated from the [[spleen]]. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with ''[[Salmonella]]'' and the virus has been provisionally named the [[crow polyomavirus]] (CPyV).<ref>{{cite doi|10.1128/JVI.80.7.3523-3531.2006}}</ref> [[Segmented filamentous bacteria]] have been isolated from the small intestine of a Western Jackdaw, although their [[pathogen]]icity or role is unknown.<ref>{{cite pmid|8501895}}</ref>

''[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]'' (1837) contains a poem by [[Richard Harris Barham]] named ''The Jackdaw of [[Rheims]]''. At a banquet, while the cardinal is having his hands ceremoniously washed, his turquoise ring is stolen. Enraged, the cardinal puts a dreadful curse on the thief. To everybody's amazement, nobody present is affected by the curse, but a jackdaw flutters down, emaciated, bald, dishevelled and lame. It leads them to its nest in the belfry where the ring is discovered. The cardinal is delighted at the return of his ring and lifts the curse and, when some time later the jackdaw dies, canonises him, giving him the name "Jim Crow".<ref>{{cite book|first=Thomas|last= Ingoldsby|title=The Ingoldsby Legends, Or, Mirth and Marvels|location=London, United Kingdom|publisher=Richard Bentley|year=1865|pages=118<U+2013>22}}</ref> [[Vincent Bourne]], a master of [[Westminster School]], wrote a Latin poem on the jackdaw which was translated into English by [[William Cowper]] and forms the opening reference to a tale by [[George Augustus Henry Sala]] about a royal wedding viewed from the point of view of a jackdaw.<ref>{{cite book|first=George Augustus|last=Sala|title=After Breakfast; or, Pictures Done with a Quill|location=London, United Kingdom |publisher=Tinsley Brother|year=1864|pages=9<U+2013>55}}</ref><!-- 'Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz' is a [[pangram]], a sentence containing every letter of the alphabet and used to display different [[typeface]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ben |last=Schott|title=Schott's original miscellany |location=London, United Kingdom |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2002|page=39|isbn = 0-7475-6320-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=zOOjXi_-INsC&pg=PA39&dq='Jackdaws+love+my+big+sphinx+of+quartz'+pangram#v=onepage&q='Jackdaws%20love%20my%20big%20sphinx%20of%20quartz'%20pangram&f=false}}</ref> too trivial to include? -->

Western Jackdaws were notorious as they also favoured fruit, especially cherries. This act was taken up in a piecemeal fashion, but [[Elizabeth I of England|{{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]] passed the ''Act for the Preservation of Grayne'' in 1566 that was taken up with more vigour. The species was hunted for its threat to grain crops and for propensity for nesting in belfries until the mid-20th century. Particularly large numbers were culled in the county of [[Norfolk]]. Western Jackdaws were also culled on game estates as they raid nests of other birds for eggs.<ref>{{cite book|last= Lovegrove|first=Roger|title=Silent Fields: The Long Decline of a Nation's Wildlife|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|year=2007|pages=79<U+2013>81, 162<U+2013>63|isbn=0-19-852071-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qQCV6eBgD9YC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=Henry+VIII+1532+act+crows#v=onepage&q=Henry%20VIII%201532%20act%20crows&f=false}}</ref><!-- cites para --> In a 2003 dissertation on public opinion of corvids, Antonia Hereth notes that the German naturalist [[Alfred Brehm]] considered the Western Jackdaw to be a lovable bird, and did not describe any negative impacts of this species on agriculture.<ref name=hereth03>{{cite book| url=http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2003/1143/index.html |title=Das Bild der Rabenv<U+00F6>gel (Corvidae) in der heutigen Gesellschaft |language=German|year=2003|publisher=Justus&nbsp;<U+2013> Liebig&nbsp;<U+2013> Universit<U+00E4>t Gie<U+00DF>en|author=Hereth, Antonia|pages=10, 25}}</ref>

The Western Jackdaw is one of a very small number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be controlled by trapping are the Crow, Jay, Magpie and Rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.basc.org.uk/en/codes-of-practice/trapping-pest-birds.cfm |title=Trapping Pest Birds |author= |date= |work= |publisher=BASC: The British Association for Shooting and Conservation |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> As of 2003 the Western Jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union [[Birds Directive]], and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations.<ref name=hereth03/> Permission to shoot Western Jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.<ref name="Hadjisterkotis03"/>
