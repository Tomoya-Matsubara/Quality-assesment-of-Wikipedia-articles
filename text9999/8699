'''USS ''Hist''''', formerly ''Thespia'', was built in 1895. She was purchased at Norfolk from David Dows, Jr., on [[22 April]] [[1898]] for use in the [[Spanish-American War]]. ''Hist'' commissioned [[13 May]] at New York, Lt. Lucien Young in command.

Arriving at [[Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] via [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] [[25 June]], ''Hist'' joined the [[blockade|blockading]] fleet off [[Santiago de Cuba]] on the 29th. The following day was a memorable one. That morning, in company with [[USS Hornet (1898)|''Hornet'']], ''Hist'' captured the Spanish schooner ''Nickerson''. Their prize in tow, the two ships were joined by [[USS Wompatuck (YT-27)|''Wompatuck'']] and the column headed for [[Manzanillo Bay]]. On their way. they engaged a Spanish [[gunboat]], which they sank, and were fired on by shore troops at [[Niguero]]. Reaching Manzanillo, the intrepid flotilla took on an enemy [[torpedo boat]], four gunboats, four [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon]]s, a [[Artillery battery|battery]] of [[field artillery]], enemy troops firing from the shore, and a Spanish-held fort. When the smoke and fire lifted after an hour and 40&nbsp;minutes of sharp fighting, ''Hornet'' had been disabled but towed to safety by ''Wompatuck'', ''Hist'' had been hit 11&nbsp;times; the Spanish had received the worst of the battle, losing a gunboat, a pontoon, and a [[sloop]] loaded with troops as well as suffering serious damage to the gun and torpedo boats. No American casualties resulted.

''Hist'' returned to Manzanillo Bay twice more during the war, [[15 July]] and [[12 August]]. In the first of these return engagements, 10 Spanish ships were sent to the bottom and many others seriously damaged. For her part in this action ''Hist'' received commendation from General [[S. H. Rios]], commanding the Cuban troops rebelling against Spanish rule. The second engagement at Manzanillo Bay was no less successful.

On [[3 July]] ''Hist'' followed up her early success by joining the fleet in battle off Santiago as the Spanish attempted to break the blockade. Under constant enemy fire, Hist rescued 142 Spanish sailors from their disabled and burning ship, ''Viscaya''. Eight days after this engagement, she and ''Wompatuck'' cut the important [[Submarine communications cable|cable]] connecting [[Media Luna, Cuba|Media Luna]] and [[Quizaro Islands]]. ''Hist'' also cut the cable between [[Punta Carapacho]] and [[Cayo Obispo]] on [[21 July]], the day after she had participated effectively in the bombardment of [[Santa Cruz]]. When not in combat, ''Hist'' patrolled the Cuban coast, searching ships, and also served as a dispatch boat between the blockading fleet at Santiago and Guantanamo.

With the end of the war ''Hist'' headed north, reaching [[Key West]] [[22 January]] [[1899]] and decommissioning there two weeks later, [[2 February]] [[1899]]. While out of commission, ''Hist'' traveled up the coast to [[Newport, R.I.]], where she recommissioned [[18 July]] [[1902]], Lt. Victor Blue commanding. ''Hist'' sailed to the [[Caribbean]] on [[16 November]] [[1902]] and served there as a patrol and dispatch ship, returning to Newport [[4 February]] [[1903]]. On [[4 March]] she was assigned duty with new [[submarine]]s being tested in [[Long Island Sound]]. After this, on [[27 June]] ''Hist'' was attached to the [[First Naval District]] as a [[tender]], continuing to operate out of Newport. On [[28 September]] 1905 she was assigned to the [[Naval Station Newport|Training Station at Newport]] as [[tender]] to the famed [[frigate]] [[USS Constellation (1854)|''Constellation'']] and remained on this duty until [[ship decommissioning|decommissioning]] [[3 May]] [[1907]].

''Hist'' recommissioned [[16 October]] [[1907]] at Newport, Lt. C.&nbsp;E. Courtney commanding, and became tender to the 2d Submarine Division. On [[6 October]] [[1908]], she was assigned to the [[Cape Cruz]]<U+2013>[[Casilda, Cuba|Casilda]] surveying expedition under Comdr. [[Armistead Rust]]. Returning to the Caribbean once more, ''Hist'' served the expedition as a supply and dispatch vessel for almost 3&nbsp;years. Putting in at [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] on [[18 May]] [[1911]], she decommissioned there [[24 July]]. ''Hist'' was stricken from the [[Navy Register]] on [[27 July]] [[1911]] and sold [[20 November]] of that year.
