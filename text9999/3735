'''Plano Senior High School''' (commonly '''Plano''', '''Plano Senior''', or '''PSHS''') is a free [[public high school|public secondary school]] in [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], [[Texas]], [[United States]] serving [[eleventh grade|eleventh]] and [[twelfth grade]]rs.  The school is part of the [[Plano Independent School District]], with admission primarily based on the locations of students' homes. Plano is a two-time [[Blue Ribbon Schools Program|Blue Ribbon School]] and a Texas Exemplary School, and has a longstanding history of academic excellence. 

Founded in 1891 as Plano Public School, serving both primary and secondary students, the school was by the mid-1910s sending a majority of its graduating classes on to college. Plano High School, created in 1952 by separating off the primary students into Mendenhall Elementary School, was immediately accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], allowing its graduates to enter college without taking an entrance exam. In 1964, Plano High School integrated with the [[Frederick Douglass]] School, formerly Plano Colored School, and the integrated football team won the first of the school's seven state championships in 1965.<ref name="mcleroy">{{cite book | last = McLeroy | first = Sherrie S. | year = 1999 | title = A Century of Excellence, Plano Independent School District: An historical perspective | publisher = Taylor Publishing | location = Dallas, Texas}}</ref> In 1975, the school moved to a new 96&nbsp;acre (0.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) campus with five buildings, very similar to the layout of a [[junior college]], where it has remained since.

Plano administers more [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] tests each year than any other school west of the [[Mississippi River]] and all but one school in the United States.<ref name="AP">The College Board. (2004) ''The College Board Annual Report''. Out of print.</ref> The school is accredited by the [[Texas Education Agency]] and the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].  Plano's graduating classes are among the largest for high schools in the United States.  Plano's Class of 2005, with 1112 graduates, was the second-largest high school graduating class in the U.S. that year, behind only that of [[Plano East Senior High School]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12535986/site/newsweek/page/2/|title=Some Numbers from NEWSWEEK's Best High Schools List - Newsweek America's Best High Schools - MSNBC.com|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=2006-07-10}}</ref>

==History==  
===Plano Public School===
[[Image:Plano Public School all pupils 1898.jpg|right|thumb|200px|All of the pupils of the Plano Public School standing outside the building in 1898.]]
[[Image:Plano Public School Auditorium 1938.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Plano Public School's Auditorium, built in 1938 by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]].]] 

In the 19th century, various private institutions existed within Plano for the education of children.  One of these, the Plano Institute, was a private school founded in 1882 that offered an [[Bachelor of Arts|Artium Baccalaureatus]] degree.  On [[June 9]], [[1891]], the people of Plano determined by a vote that the city should assume control of the schools. In July of that same year, the citizens approved a fifty [[Cent (currency)|cent]] tax for school purposes<ref name="earlyyears">{{cite book | last = Sigler | first = E.A. | coauthors = Wells, Frances | title = Plano, Texas: The Early Years | origyear = 1985 | edition = 2nd ed. | year = 1996 | publisher = Henington Publishing  | location = Wolfe City, Texas | chapter = Education | id = ISBN 0-9651841-0-2}}</ref> and for the purchase of the Plano Institute's land and building.<ref name="psc1940">{{cite news | first=E.A. | last=Sigler | title=Three Buildings Lost By Fire&mdash;School Now Ranks as One of Best In State | work=Plano Star Courier | date= 22 February 1940}}</ref> The building was used for the new Plano Public School, from which Plano Senior High School would develop.  Thus, 1891 is generally considered the school's foundation year. The original school grounds would later become the Cox Administration Building.<ref name="earlyyears"/> In 1892, Plano graduated its first class of five people.

In 1899, the [[Plano Independent School District]] became a separate entity from the city.<ref name="mcleroy"/> Because of this separation, 1899 is cited by the district as the establishment date for Plano Senior High School.  Starting in 1901, the school was affiliated with the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], [[Baylor University|Baylor]], [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]], and [[Southwestern University|Southwestern]] in order to ensure that graduates could secure entrance to college.  Unfortunately for students, official affiliations eventually ended due to budget restrictions.<ref name="mcleroy"/> However, the affiliations, coupled with the high standards of Plano schools, led to a large number of graduating students going on to attend college.  By the mid-1910s, a majority of the graduating class (as much as eighty percent) matriculated to an institute of higher learning, such as [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Texas at Austin]], or [[Baylor University]].  According to the 1915 Plano Review, "The University of Texas probably draws more students from Plano than any one other institution."  The Review goes on to state that "no town in Texas, in proportion to its size, has more students in higher institutions of learning than Plano."<ref>{{cite news | first=T.H.B. | last=Blalack | title=College Students from Plano | work=The Plano Review | publisher=Plano Star Courier | date=1915}}</ref>

The original building burned down in 1894 and was reconstructed on the same site. The rebuilt Plano Public School again burned down in the spring of 1903, leading to the construction of yet another new building.  The students went to classes in the local Opera House until the completion of the new building, often called the "Spanish School" because of its [[Islamic architecture|Moorish architecture]].  Following its construction, the district built various new facilities to support its students, including a new [[band (music)|band hall]], [[gym|gymnasium]], and [[auditorium]].<ref name="mcleroy"/>

In 1922, the [[Texas Education Agency|Texas Department of Education]] informed the district that the Spanish School was "inadequate ... for high school work."  By 1924, the district had constructed a new building to house the Plano Public School.  In 1935, while the country was in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] offered to build the district a much-needed new gym.<ref name="mcleroy"/>  The $125,000 USD (1.61 million 2005 dollars)<ref name="inflation">{{cite web | url = http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ | title = The Inflation Calculator | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref> building, completed in 1938, was used as a gym, auditorium, classroom, and laboratory, allowing new subjects to be taught, including [[agriculture]], [[business]], and [[family and consumer science|home economics]].<ref name="earlyyears"/>  At the time, Texas required that students complete 16 [[credit (education)|credits]], or full semester courses, to graduate. This expansion allowed Plano students a choice of 30 credits with which to fulfill the requirement.<ref name="mcleroy"/>

===Plano High School===
In September 1952, Mendenhall Elementary School was created, allowing primary students to be separated from secondary students.  That same year, the newly created Plano High School was accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]], allowing its graduates to enter college without taking an entrance exam.<ref name="mcleroy"/> In 1961, Plano High School moved to a new location on the east side of town, now the site of Williams High School, and the new building was constructed at a cost of $993,590 (6.2 million 2005 dollars).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://k-12.pisd.edu/schools/williams/page/info.htm | title = T.H. Williams High School: General Information | accessdate = 2006-05-30 }}</ref><ref name="inflation"/>

Following the 1954 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the Plano [[board of education|school board]] considered the issue of [[desegregation|integrating]] Plano High School with Plano Colored High School. The school board formed a committee of "colored citizens" to address the concern.  Twice, in 1955 and 1957, when asked if they favored [[racial integration|integration]], the citizens on the committee stated they "were perfectly happy with their school and would like to be left alone." In 1964, the issue was raised again when the school board voted to let students of the Plano Colored School, by then renamed the Frederick Douglass School, decide if they wanted to integrate with Plano High School.  The students voted to integrate, and Douglass School became a primary facility.  The 1964&ndash;1965 football team, the first integrated team for the school, won the first state championship in school history, helping to ease racial tensions.  By 1968, Douglass School was closed. The Texas Education Agency later praised the district for its handling of integration, calling it "an exceptional job."<ref name="mcleroy"/>

===Plano Senior High School===
In the 1970s, in response to massive growth and with a desire to lower [[dropout]] rates and increase college readiness, then Superintendent H. Wayne Hendrick began a search for a new way to organize the school system.  After touring several successful systems across the country, including those in [[Flint, Michigan]], [[Denver, Colorado|Cherry Creek, Colorado]], [[Evanston, Illinois]], and [[Hillsboro, Oregon]], Hendrick found none of their systems suitable for Plano's needs. He instead decided to create a new senior high system. While the majority of American high schools serve students from grades nine through twelve, Plano's high schools serve only [[ninth grade|ninth]] and [[tenth grade]]rs, while senior high schools serve eleventh and twelfth graders.  Two high schools [[feeder school|feed]] into each senior high school, such as Plano Senior High.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://pisd.edu/schools/feeder.schools/index.shtml | title = Feeder Schools Chart | work = Plano ISD Website | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref> This system allows students to complete most of their required credits in high school and specialize with vocational classes at the senior high.

A plan was created for a 96&nbsp;acre (0.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) campus with five buildings, very similar to the layout of a [[junior college]].  The campus now contains six buildings with the addition in 2002 of an indoor workout facility.  The buildings are interconnected by [[green belt|greenspace]], which features a man-made [[pond]] as the central element.  The campus was constructed at a cost of 10.3&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] (38.6&nbsp;million 2005 dollars).<ref name="inflation"/>  The school opened for the 1975-1976 school year with only two buildings completed.  By [[Christmas]] of 1975, all five buildings were completed, and the school was dedicated on [[March 7]], [[1975]]. The new senior high school offered a broad variety of studies previously unseen in the district. The new facility offered courses in [[social studies]], [[drama]], [[art]], [[journalism]] as well as vocational studies in [[fashion design|clothing design]], professional [[childcare]], [[cosmetology]], [[air conditioning]] repair, and [[metalworking]].<ref name="mcleroy"/>

Due to high population growth rates in Plano, [[Plano East Senior High School]] was built in 1979 to alleviate overcrowding.  In 1999, [[Plano West Senior High School]] was built for the same purpose. Plano Senior High students currently feed from Vines and [[Jasper High School (Plano, Texas)|Jasper High School]]s. In 2002, Plano completed an $18 million renovation, making [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] compliance upgrades, and renovations to the science department, [[HVAC]], fire sprinkler, and security systems, and site lighting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pisd.edu/schools/construction/2000_03_FPC_Final_Report/Projects/PSHS.pdf | title = PSHS Site Improvements | work = Plano Independent School District Website | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-05-30 }}</ref>

==Academics==
[[Image:pshs duck week.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Duck]]s that inhabit the area around the pond have inspired a yearly "Duck Week" celebration every spring on campus.]]
Plano operates on an 8:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. schedule, which includes eight periods and a break for off-campus lunch during which all students may leave campus to eat lunch.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://k-12.pisd.edu/schools/pshs/Admin/bells.htm | title = Bell Schedule | work = Plano Senior High School Website | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref>

Plano offers 29 [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] courses, which is all of the 31 courses possible with the exception of [[French literature]] and [[Latin literature]]. Yearly, the school administers more Advanced Placement tests than any other school west of the [[Mississippi River]], and the second most tests in the United States (2,237 total exams in the year 2005).<ref name="AP"/>  The school also offers many [[vocational education|vocational courses]], as was Superintendent Hendrick's intent when it was built.  Plano currently offers vocational courses in agriculture, home economics, [[journalism]], fashion design, [[advertising|advertising design]], [[Technical drawing|drafting]], [[automobile design|automotive technology]], [[auto mechanic|automotive paint and body]], [[clinical rotation]], and [[criminal justice]].

In the 2005 graduating class, 97% of graduates went onto college or university: 85% went on to four-year universities, while the remaining 12% went to two-year colleges.  Students in the class achieved an average composite [[SAT]] score of 1162 out of 1600 and a mean composite [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] score of 24.7 out of 36.<ref name="profile">{{cite web | url = http://k-12.pisd.edu/schools/pshs/Profile2.pdf | title = Class of 2005 Profile | format=PDF | work = Plano Senior High School Website  | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref> Many Plano students received [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholarship]] accolades in the 2005 school year, including 30 finalists, 33 semi-finalists, and 58 commended students.<ref name="profile"/> These individual class statistics are indicative of previous years' performances.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pisd.edu/schools/secondary/pshs/index.shtml | title = Plano Senior High School | work = Plano ISD Website | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }} Concerning 2003-2004 National Merit results</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pisd.edu/news/archive/2004-05/national.merit.semifinalists.shtml | title = 95 Seniors Named 2005 National Merit Semifinalists | work = Plano ISD eNews | accessdate = 2006-06-08 }} Concerning 2004-2005 National Merit results</ref>

==Extracurricular activities==
The [[extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] offered at Plano Senior High School are many and varied due to the school's large size.  There are chapters of national organizations such as the [[National Honor Society]] and clubs founded by Plano students such as Acoustical Word, in which students play guitar and recite poetry.  Service organizations such as [[Key Club]] coexist alongside clubs where students can have fun.  The usual range of athletic and music organizations are there for students to join in addition to some of Plano's more unique clubs. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://k-12.pisd.edu/schools/pshs/Clubs/clubs.htm|title=Plano Senior High School: Clubs|accessdate=2006-07-09}}</ref>

Plano Senior High School teams compete in [[University Interscholastic League|UIL]] competitions in District 8 of the 5A Class, the class designated for the largest schools.  Districts are assigned arbitrarily, with the sole controlling factor being the proximity of schools in the district. Plano will move to District 9-5A in the 2006&ndash;2007 school year, following the UIL system's biennial realignment. 

Plano's 2005 enrollment for competitive purposes is officially listed as 4,706.87.  This is the number used by the UIL when determining what other schools Plano competes against in all UIL-sponsored athletic and academic competitions. This number exceeds the on-site enrollment of Plano Senior High because the official enrollment of each senior high school also includes the enrollment of each of its [[feeder school]]s.  Ninth and tenth graders who are good enough to compete at the [[varsity team|varsity]] level of a sport may be bussed to the senior high school to compete in varsity sports, therefore becoming part of the senior high's talent pool.  The number is fractional because Jasper High School, one of Plano's feeder schools, is also a feeder school for [[Plano West Senior High School]], and therefore the enrollment is split.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.uil.utexas.edu/2006align/pdf/5A_fb_bsktb.pdf | title = 2006-08 Official Football and 2006-07 Official Basketball District Alignment Conference 5A | work = University Interscholastic League Wesbite | format = PDF | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref>

===Athletics===
====Football====
[[Image:Plano High School football team 1900.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The 1900 Plano football team was the school's first athletic team.]]
[[Image:Plano High School 1914 girls basketball.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Plano's girls' basketball team, 1914]]
A small group of Plano boys formed an unofficial [[American football|football]] team in 1898.  In 1900, the first official high school team was formed.  In 1909, Superintendent C.F. Walker complained to the local paper, "Do you sleep well at night when you know your boy is on the streets kicking a football?"  Despite his concerns, by 1914, Plano fielded a football team and a men's and women's basketball team. However, the [[World War I|first World War]] cancelled all athletics, as there were not enough men to field any teams.<ref name="mcleroy"/>

By 1925, athletics programs had been re-established, and a mascot had been chosen, the Wildcat.  The 1925 football team completed an undefeated season, and the resulting fervor led to the increased funding of athletics in Plano.  The district allocated funds to purchase a cow pasture for the purpose of playing football and other sports.  The pasture was renamed Guy M. Rice Field, after the team's first football coach. By 1939, a "modern" stadium had been built at this site.  With the construction of Plano High School in 1957, an accompanying stadium was built, and Rice Field was abandoned.  In 1977, Plano completed construction on John Clark Field at a cost of $2.75 million ($8.92 million 2005 dollars).<ref name="inflation"/>  Clark Field, with a capacity of 14,224, is the facility used for most varsity football games today. Kimbrough Stadium, a new stadium in 2004, is also occasionally the site for home games.<ref name="mcleroy"/><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spe/2005/highschool_stadiums/ | title = Area High School Football Stadiums | work = DallasNews.com | accessdate = 2006-05-24 }}</ref>

Following the integration of Plano High School with Plano Colored School, the football team made its first run at the Texas state championship in 1965.  Most of the town shut down to make the drive to [[Austin, Texas]], and see the Wildcats win their first state championship.  After the Wildcats won the championship again in 1967, the team was voted Texas Outstanding Football Team.<ref name="mcleroy"/>

The Plano Varsity football team has gone to nine Texas state championships, as detailed below, and won seven.  Plano's seven championships tie the school with [[Brownwood, Texas|Brownwood]], [[Celina, Texas|Celina]], and [[Southlake, Texas|Southlake Carroll]] for the most in Texas. <ref name="UILfootball">{{cite news | author=Staff Reports | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/highschools/leaderboard/football/uilchamps.foot.html | title=UIL football championships | work=Dallas Morning News}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/highschools/topstories/stories/122406dnspohsfbslc.30c358a.html | title=Ever green: Carroll claims another crown | work=WFAA.com|date=[[2006-12-23]]|accessdate=2006-12-24}}</ref>

Following the creation of [[Plano West Senior High School]] in 1999, Plano lost much of its player base to the new school, and the 2003 Plano Varsity football team suffered a winless season for the first time in the history of the school.  The tenth graders who were recruited to play at the varsity level during the dismal 2003 season became twelfth graders in the 2005 season.  Partly due to this extra experience, the 2005 team completed a perfect 10-0 regular season and went 3-1 in the playoffs, finally being defeated by the eventual state champions, the nationally rated number one  [[Southlake, Texas|Southlake Carroll Dragons]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://texasprepxtra.rivals.com/hsHighSchool.asp?School=873&Year=2005 | title = Plano | work = Texas Prep Xtra | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref>

===Wildcat marching band===
An unofficial band was first organized in 1935.  In 1955, the school hired [[University of Arkansas]] graduate Emmitt Clem, who led the band for twenty-one years and wrote the [[alma mater|school song]].  The band quickly became widely acclaimed under his direction.  The band performed pre-game for the first [[Dallas Cowboys]] season and at a nationally televised Cowboys game at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] in 1962.  After Clem retired, Charles Forque took over as the band director.  Forque brought close friend [[Doc Severinsen]], band leader of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', to the high school every year to play with the band.<ref name="mcleroy"/> The band has performed in [[Carnegie Hall]] and at [[The Midwest Clinic|The Midwest Band and Orchestra Clinic]]. The Plano band is currently under the direction of Plano alumnus, Jeremy Kondrat.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://k-12.pisd.edu/schools/PSHS/Band/directors.htm | title = Plano Band Directors | work = Plano Band Website | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref> Plano Senior High was named by the [[Grammy Award|Grammy Foundation]] as a ''2005 Grammy Signature School Gold'' school for their achievement in the arts.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.arkmea.org/announcements/Danville.htm | title = The Grammy Foundation<U+00AE> names 42 high schools as the 2005 Grammy<U+00AE> Signature Schools | accessdate = 2006-03-17 }}</ref>
