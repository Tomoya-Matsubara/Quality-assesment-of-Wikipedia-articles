The '''Libyan Navy''' is the maritime force of [[Libya]], established in November 1962. It is a fairly typical small navy with a few missile [[frigates]], [[corvettes]] and [[patrol boat]]s to defend the coastline, but with a very limited self-defence capability. The Navy has always been the smallest of Libya's services and has always been dependent on foreign sources for equipment, spare parts, and training.

Its first [[warship]] was delivered in 1966. Initially the effective force was limited to smaller vessels, but this changed after the rise of Colonel [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] in 1969. From this time, Libya started to buy armaments from Europe and the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Customs]] and [[Water police|Harbour police]] were amalgamated with the Navy in 1970, extending the Navy's mission to include anti-smuggling and customs duties. The total personnel of the Libyan Navy is about 8,000.

== Background ==
The Navy's primary mission is to defend the coast. A strengthening of the service was made in the 1970s; the Soviet Union sold six [[Foxtrot class submarine|Foxtrot-class SSK submarines]], and  though two of them were only averagely serviceable, they became the main threats to the US Navy in the Mediterranean Sea. In the meantime, Libya bought four Russian [[Nanuchka class corvette]]s, that even in the export versions were well-armed and powerful ships. Another four [[Assad class corvette]]s were acquired from Italy. These had [[Otomat]] long range missiles (in the Mk.I version without [[Data link|datalink]] for in-flight course correction) and modern artillery. They were less well-armed as anti-aircraft ships than the Nanuchkas but, with a displacement almost twice that of a typical [[Fast Attack Craft|FAC]], had [[Anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] capabilities, with sonar and light torpedoes.

== Actions ==
[[File:Burning Libyan Corvette.jpg|thumb|Burning Libyan corvette, 1986]]
The only military action seen by the Libyan Navy was an encounter with the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] in March 1986 in the [[Action in the Gulf of Sidra (1986)]], when one missile boat and a [[corvette]] were destroyed, and other ships were damaged by [[A-6 Intruder|A-6]]s. Unusually, some of these attacks were performed, successfully, with [[Cluster bomb|CBUs]] like the [[CBU-100 Cluster Bomb|Mk.20 Rockeye]] designed as an anti-tank weapon.

In July 1984, the [[Roll-on/roll-off|Ro-Ro ferry]] ''Ghat'' (or ''Ghada'') is believed to have mined the [[Red Sea]] a few kilometres south of the [[Suez Canal]].   Approximately nineteen ships were damaged, including a Soviet container ship which was the first to be hit on 9 July. The [[Islamic Jihad Organisation]]  took responsibility for the incident, however Egypt's President [[Hosni Mubarak]] did not believe the claims and blamed [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] and Libya. Other sources agreed after it was learnt that the ship took fifteen days to complete a voyage that normally would take eight days, the head of the Libyan minelaying division was on board, and that, when inspected by French officials in [[Marseilles]] the aft door was damaged.  Due to concerns about the safety and potential lost revenue from the canal, Egypt asked for assistance in sweeping the mines in complex operation that involved mine-hunters from the French, British, Italian, Dutch, and US navies. The British located a Soviet-made mine, which was most likely sold to Libya after 1981 and was laid to cause problems for Egypt.<ref>Levie, Howard.

Originally Libya received six submarines from the Soviet union in 1982. But there were no patrols since 1984 and one submarine is reported sunk in 1993 and another one was abandoned in Lithuania due to international sanctions. There were reports about one submarine being refitted in 2003 but it is very unlikely that the submarines are still operational.<ref name="janesub" />
