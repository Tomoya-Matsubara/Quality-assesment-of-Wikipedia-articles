'''Eurasiatic''' is a [[language family]] proposed by [[Joseph Greenberg]] that groups all of the language families historically spoken in northern [[Eurasia]] into a single [[macrofamily]], with the sole exception of the [[Yeniseian languages]], spoken in part of [[Siberia]], but including the [[Eskimo-Aleut languages]], spoken in northernmost [[North America]] and [[Greenland]] with a toehold in easternmost Siberia.

==The branches of Eurasiatic==

<!-- ATTENTION!  Thank you for caring about the accuracy of Wikipedia.  However, please do not alter this list.  It consists of the terms used by Greenberg in his Eurasiatic work, not those in the most standard use. The point is to present Greenberg's Eurasiatic hypothesis, not the language names most used currently or the most popular classifications. -->

As laid out by Greenberg (2000:279-81), the branches of Eurasiatic are: 

*[[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]
*[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]
*[[Uralic-Yukaghir languages|Uralic-Yukaghir]]
*[[Altaic languages|Altaic]]
*[[Korean language|Korean]]-[[Japonic languages|Japanese]]-[[Ainu language|Ainu]]
*[[Nivkh language|Gilyak]] (= Nivkh)
*[[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]] (= Chukotko-Kamchatkan)
*[[Eskimo-Aleut languages|Eskimo-Aleut]]

These groupings, except for the first two, are the native languages in various parts of northeast Asia. Eskimo-Aleut is moreover spoken across the subarctic region from northeast Asia to Greenland, and the Uralic languages are also spoken westward as far as into Scandinavia and Hungary.

==Relation to other language families==

According to Greenberg, the language family that Eurasiatic is most closely connected to is [[Amerind languages|Amerind]]. He states that "[t]he Eurasiatic-Amerind family represents a relatively recent expansion (circa 15,000 BP) into territory opened up by the melting of the Arctic ice cap" (2002:2). In contrast, "Eurasiatic-Amerind stands apart from the other families of the Old World, among which the differences are much greater and represent deeper chronological groupings" (ib.).

Eurasiatic and [[Nostratic]] include many of the same language families.
[[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]]'s Nostratic dictionary did not include the smaller Siberian language families listed in Eurasiatic, but this was because protolanguages had not been reconstructed for them, and Nostraticists have not attempted to exclude these languages from Nostratic.
(However, [[Gell-Mann]], Peiros, and [[George Starostin|Starostin]] (2009)<ref>http://www.nostratic.ru/books/(316)gell-starostin-jlr1.pdf Journal of Language Relationship <U+2022> <U+0412><U+043E><U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0441><U+044B> <U+044F><U+0437><U+044B><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E> <U+0440><U+043E><U+0434><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0430> <U+2022> 1 (2009) <U+2022> pp. 13 <U+2013> 30</ref> groups [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotko-Kamchatkan]] and [[Nivkh language|Nivkh]] with [[Almosan]] instead of Eurasiatic.)
Most recently Nostraticists have accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup within Nostratic (2005:331) with [[Afroasiatic languages]], [[Kartvelian languages]], and [[Dravidian languages]] forming the rest of Nostratic.
The even wider [[Borean]] proposal includes almost all language families of Eurasia.

==Reception by linguists==

The Eurasiatic hypothesis is dismissed by many linguists, often on the ground that Greenberg relies in his research on [[mass comparison]], a method he developed in the 1950s that remains extremely controversial and sometimes attracted considerable criticism (i.a. by [[Stefan Georg]] and [[Alexander Vovin]]). Others, citing the wide acceptance of his classification of [[African languages]] (cf. Nichols 1992:5), withhold judgment. Greenberg also has his supporters, among them the American linguists [[Merritt Ruhlen]] and [[Allan R. Bomhard|Allan Bomhard]].

One of the basic difficulties to proving a genetic relationship between two languages is that contact between populations often results in exchange of words, so that similarities in vocabulary do not necessarily indicate a common origin. Greenberg addressed this question in his ''Essays in Linguistics'' (1957:39).

==Morphosyntax==

[[Winfred P. Lehmann]] (2002) and others have recently argued that [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] descended from a language characterized by [[active-stative language|active-stativeness]], Subject-Object-Verb word order, use of [[agglutinative language|agglutination]], and absence of grammatical gender.
