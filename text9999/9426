'''<U+00C9>tienne Baudet''', an eminent French [[engraving|engraver]], was born at [[Vineuil, Loir-et-Cher|Vineuil]], in the department of [[Loir-et-Cher]], about 1636. He was a pupil of [[S<U+00E9>bastien Bourdon]] and [[Cornelis Bloemaert]], and afterwards went to Rome, and appears to have adopted the manner of Cornelis Bloemaert in his earliest plates, which are executed entirely with the [[burin|graver]]. He afterwards on his return to Paris altered his manner, and calling in the assistance of the [[Drypoint|point]], he executed his best prints, which bear a strong resemblance to the manner of [[Jean Baptiste Poilly]]. He made an excellent choice in the subjects of his plates, which are from the works of some of the most distinguished masters of Italy and France. He was a member of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie de peinture et de sculpture|Royal Academy of Paris]], in which city he died in 1711.
