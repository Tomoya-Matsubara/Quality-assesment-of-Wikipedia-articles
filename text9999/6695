A '''wine bottle''' is a [[bottle]] used for holding [[wine]], generally made of [[glass]].  Some wines are [[fermentation (wine)|fermented]] in the bottle, others are bottled only after fermentation.

Recently, the bottle has become a standard unit of volume to describe sales in the wine industry, measuring {{convert|750|ml}}.{{fact|date=May 2012}}  However, bottles are produced in a variety of volumes and shapes.

Wine bottles are traditionally sealed with [[cork (wine)|cork]], but [[Screw cap (wine)|screw-top caps]] are [[Screw cap (wine)#Adoption|becoming popular]], and there are several [[alternative wine closures|other methods]] used to seal a bottle.<ref name="Johnson000">{{cite book

== Sizes ==
The chart below<ref>[http://www.awinestore.com/pages.php?pageid=9&mode=preview#7 Wine 101 :: AWinestore.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> expresses the sizes of various wine bottles in multiples relating to a standard bottle of wine, which is {{convert|0.75|l|U.S.gal impgal|2|lk=on}}.  Many common sizes are named for [[Bible|Biblical]] kings and historical figures.

Most [[List of Champagne houses|champagne houses]] are unable to carry out [[Secondary fermentation (wine)|secondary fermentation]] in bottles larger than a magnum due to the difficulty in [[Sparkling_wine_production#Riddling|riddling]] large, heavy bottles. After the secondary fermentation completes, the champagne must be transferred from the magnums into larger bottles, which results in a loss of pressure. Some believe this re-bottling exposes the champagne to greater oxidation and therefore results in an inferior product compared to champagne which remains in the bottle in which it was fermented.<ref>{{cite web |title=Champagne Bottle Sizes |url=http://www.champagnemagic.com/sizes.htm|accessdate=7 March 2012}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2013}}</ref>

<nowiki>*</nowiki> For many years, the [[United States|U.S.]] standard (non-[[metric system|metric]]) wine and [[liquor]] bottle was the "fifth", meaning one-fifth of a [[United States customary units#Liquid volume|U.S. gallon]], or {{convert|25.6|U.S.floz|ml impfloz|sigfig=3}}. Some beverages also came in tenth-gallon, half-gallon and one-gallon sizes. In 1979, the U.S. adopted the [[metric system]] for wine bottles, with the basic bottle becoming 750&nbsp;ml, as in [[Europe]].{{cn|date=February 2013}}

==Shapes==
[[Image:Bocksbeutel bottle.jpg|thumb|[[Bocksbeutel]] shaped wine bottle]]
[[Image:Burgundy bottles.jpg|thumb|upright|Burgundy bottles]]
Wine producers in [[Portugal]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Germany]] follow the tradition of their local areas in choosing the shape of bottle most appropriate for their wine.

*[[Port wine|Port]], [[sherry]], and [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] varieties: straight-sided and high-shouldered with a pronounced punt. Port and sherry bottles may have a bulbous neck to collect any residue.
*[[Burgundy wine|Burgundies]] and [[Rh<U+00F4>ne (wine region)|Rh<U+00F4>ne]] varieties: tall bottles with sloping shoulders and a smaller punt.
*[[Schlegel]]{{dn|date=July 2013}} variety, predominantly used in German wine growing regions: similar to Burgundy bottles, but more slender and elongated.
*[[Rheingau|Rhine]] (also known as [[hock (wine)|hock]] or hoch), [[Mosel wine|Mosel]], and [[Alsace wine|Alsace]] varieties: narrow and tall with little or no punt.
*[[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] and other sparkling wines: thick-walled and wide with a pronounced punt and sloping shoulders.
*German wines from [[Franconia (wine region)|Franconia]]: the [[Bocksbeutel]] bottle.
*The [[Chianti]] and some other Italian wines: the ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'', a round-bottomed flask encased in a straw basket. This is more often used for everyday [[table wine]]s; many of the higher-grade Chianti producers have switched to Bordeaux-type bottles.

Many North and South American, South African, and Australasian wine producers select the bottle shape with which they wish to associate their wines. For instance, a producer who believes his wine is similar to Burgundy may choose to bottle his wine in Burgundy-style bottles.

Other producers (both in and out of Europe) have chosen idiosyncratic bottle styles for marketing purposes. Pere-Anselme markets its [[Ch<U+00E2>teauneuf-du-Pape]] in bottles that appear half-melted. The [http://www.moselland.de/275.0.html?&L=1 Moselland company] of Germany has a [[riesling]] with a bottle in the shape of a house cat.

The home [[wine making|wine maker]] may use any bottle, as the shape of the bottle does not affect the taste of the finished product. The sole exception is in producing [[sparkling wine]], where thicker-walled bottles should be used to handle the excess pressure.

Most wine bottles standards have a bore (inner neck) diameter of 18.5 at the mouth of the bottle and increase to 21 mm before expanding into the full bottle.

==Colours==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
The traditional colours used for wine bottles are:
*Bordeaux: dark green for reds, light green for dry whites, colourless for sweet whites.
*Burgundy and the Rhone: dark green.
*Mosel and Alsace: dark to medium green, although some producers have traditionally used amber.
*Rhine: amber, although some producers have traditionally used green.
*Champagne: Usually dark to medium green. Ros<U+00E9> champagnes are usually a colorless or green.

Clear colourless bottles have recently become popular with white wine producers in many countries, including [[Greece]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]]. Dark-coloured bottles are most commonly used for red wines, but many white wines also still come in dark green bottles. The main reason for using coloured or tinted glass is that natural [[sunlight]] can break down desirable [[antioxidant]]s such as [[vitamin c]] and [[tannin (wine)|tannins]] in a wine over time, which affects storability and can cause a wine to prematurely [[oxidation|oxidise]]. Dark glass can prevent oxidation and increase storage life. It is therefore mostly ready-to-drink white wines with a short anticipated storage lifespan which are bottled in clear colourless bottles.

== Foils ==
[[File:Paper strip under wine bottle foil.jpg|thumb|150px|A paper strip beneath the foil]]
Commercial corked wine bottles typically have a protective sleeve called a foil (commonly referred to as a "capsule") covering the top of the bottle, the purpose of which is to protect the [[cork (material)|cork]] from being gnawed away by [[rodent]]s or infested with the [[cork weevil]] and to serve as collar to catch small drips when pouring. The foil also serves as a decorative element of the bottle's label. Foils were historically made of [[lead]]; however, because of research showing that trace amounts of toxic lead could remain on the lip of the bottle and mix with the poured wine,<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher |first=Lawrence M. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/02/us/lead-levels-in-many-wines-exceed-us-standards-for-water.html |title=Lead Levels in Many Wines Exceed U.S. Standards for Water |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=1991-08-02 |accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> lead foil bottleneck wrapping were slowly phased out, and by the 1990s,<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/ANS00446.html ]{{dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref> most foils were made of [[tin]], heat-shrink plastic ([[polyethylene]] or [[PVC]]), or [[aluminium]] or polylaminate aluminium.  Sealing wax is sometimes used, or the foil can be omitted entirely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wineloverspage.com/wineadvisor1/tswa031027.phtml |title=30 Second Wine Advisor |publisher=wineloverspage.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-02}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2013}}</ref> In the US, the FDA officially banned lead foils on domestic and imported wine bottles as of 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/us/cfr/title21/21-3.0.1.1.16.4.1.6.html |title=Justia :: 21 C.F.R. <U+00A7> 189.301 Tin-coated lead foils for wine bottles |publisher=Law.justia.com |date=1996-02-08 |accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref>

Some bottles of wine have a paper strip beneath the foil, as a seal of authenticity, which must be broken before the bottle can be uncorked.

==Punts==
[[File:Bouteille.jpg|thumb|150px|right|An empty (Bordeaux-style) wine bottle with a punt at its base.]]
A punt, also known as a kick-up, refers to the dimple at the bottom of a wine bottle. There is no consensus explanation for its purpose. The more commonly cited explanations include:<ref name="Johnson000"/>

* It is a historical remnant from the era when wine bottles were [[glassblowing#Free-blowing|free blown]] using a [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] and [[pontil]].  This technique leaves a [[pontil mark|punt mark]] on the base of the bottle; by indenting the point where the [[pontil]] is attached, this scar would not scratch the table or make the bottle unstable.
* It had the function of making the bottle less likely to topple over<U+2014>a bottle designed with a flat bottom only needs a small imperfection to make it unstable<U+2014>the dimple historically allowed for a larger margin of error.
* It consolidates sediment deposits in a thick ring at the bottom of the bottle, preventing much/most of it from being poured into the glass; this may be more historical than a functional attribute, since most modern wines contain little or no sediment.<ref>(MacNeil 2001)</ref>
* It increases the strength of the bottle, allowing it to hold the high pressure of sparkling wine/champagne.
* It provides a grip for [[Sparkling wine production#Riddling|riddling]] a bottle of sparkling wine manually in the traditional champagne production process.
* It consumes some volume of the bottle, allowing the bottle to appear larger for the same amount of wine, which may impress the purchaser.<ref name="puntglossary">{{cite web|url=http://www.wineintro.com/glossary/p/punt.html |title=Punt Wine Bottle Indentation |publisher=Wineintro.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-02}}{{Self-published source|date=January 2013}}</ref>
* Taverns had a steel pin set vertically in the bar. The empty bottle would be thrust bottom-end down onto this pin, puncturing a hole in the top of the punt, guaranteeing the bottle could not be refilled [folklore].
* It prevents the bottle from resonating as easily, decreasing the likelihood of shattering during transportation.
* It allows bottles to be more easily stacked end to end.<ref name="puntglossary"/>
* Bottles could be stacked in cargo holds on ships without rolling around and breaking.
* Punts are also used to help pour the wine, providing a grip for the thumb on the bottom of the bottle for easy pouring.
* It makes the bottle easier to clean prior to filling with wine.  When a stream of water is injected into the bottle and impacts the punt, it is distributed throughout the bottom of the bottle and removes residues.
* The claim that the larger the punt the finer the wine in the bottle is an [[old wives tale]] which wine experts have dismissed as nonsense.

==Environmental impact==
Glass retains its colour on [[glass recycling|recycling]], and the [[United Kingdom]] has a large surplus of green glass because it imports a large quantity of wine but [[Wine from the United Kingdom|produces very little]]. 1.4 million [[tonne]]s are sent to [[landfill]] annually.<ref name="guardian">
{{cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Is it OK ... to drink wine? |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2006/may/09/ethicalmoney.foodanddrink |date=2006-05-09 |accessdate=2007-11-22 |first=Leo |last=Hickman }}</ref>

Glass is a relatively heavy packing material and wine bottles use quite thick glass, so the [[tare weight]] of a full wine bottle is a relatively high proportion of its [[gross weight]]. The average weight of an empty 75 cl wine bottle is 500 g (and can range from 300 to 900 g), which makes the glass 40% of the total weight of the full bottle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/downloads/Wine_Brochure_sept_2006.be60ee55.3258.pdf |title=The WRAP Wine Initiative |accessdate=2011-09-14 }}</ref> This has led to suggestions that wine should be exported [[bulk material handling|in bulk]] from producer regions and bottled close to the market.  This would reduce the cost of transportation and its [[carbon footprint]], and provide a local market for recycled green glass.<ref>
