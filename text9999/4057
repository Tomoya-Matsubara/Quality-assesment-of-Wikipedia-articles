'''John Marshall Harlan''' (May 20, 1899 <U+2013> December 29, 1971) was an American jurist who served as an [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] from 1955 to 1971. His namesake was his grandfather [[John Marshall Harlan]], another associate justice who served from 1877 to 1911. 

Harlan was a student at [[Upper Canada College]] and [[Appleby College]] and then at [[Princeton University]]. He continued his education at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref name=Yarbrough/> Upon his return to the U.S. in 1923 Harlan worked in the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland while studying at [[New York Law School]]. Later he served as Assistant [[U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] and as Special Assistant Attorney General of New York. In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], and a year later president [[Dwight Eisenhower]] nominated Harlan to the United States Supreme Court following the death of Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]].<ref name=papers/>

Harlan is often characterized as a member of the conservative wing of the [[Earl Warren|Warren Court]]. He advocated a limited role for the judiciary, remarking that the Supreme Court should not be considered "a general haven for reform movements".<ref name=Yarbrough1989/> In general, Harlan adhered more closely to [[precedent]], and was more reluctant to overturn legislation, than many of his colleagues on the Court. He strongly disagreed with the doctrine of [[incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], which held that the provisions of the [[U.S. Bill of Rights|federal Bill of Rights]] applied to the state governments, not merely the Federal.<ref name=Vasicko/> At the same time, he advocated a broad [[Judicial interpretation|interpretation]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s [[Due process#Due process in the United States|Due Process Clause]], arguing that it protected a wide range of rights not expressly mentioned in the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=Vasicko/> Harlan is sometimes called the "[[Dissenting opinion|great dissenter]]" of the Warren Court, and has been described as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices in the twentieth century.<ref name=Yarbrough0/> Justice Harlan was gravely ill when he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.<ref name=Dorsen139/> He died from spinal cancer three months later, on December 29, 1971. After Harlan's retirement, [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] appointed [[William Rehnquist]] to replace him.<ref name=Dean/>

==Early life and career==
John Marshall Harlan was born on May 20, 1899 in [[Chicago]], Illinois.<ref name=papers/> He was the son of John Maynard Harlan, a Chicago lawyer and politician, and Elizabeth Flagg. He had three sisters.<ref name=Yarbrough33/> Historically, Harlan's family had been politically active. His forebear, George Harlan, served as one of governors of Delaware during the seventeenth century; his great-grandfather, [[James Harlan (congressman)|James Harlan]], was a congressman during the 1830s;<ref name="Leitch"/> his grandfather, also [[John Marshall Harlan]], was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1877 to 1911; and his uncle, [[James S. Harlan]], was attorney general of [[Puerto Rico]] and then chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.<ref name=Dorsen139>[[#Dorsen|Dorsen]], 2002, pp. 139<U+2013>143</ref><ref name="Leitch"/> 

In his younger years, Harlan attended [[The Latin School of Chicago]].<ref name=Yarbrough>[[#Yarbrough2|Yarbrough]], 1992, pp. 10<U+2013>11</ref> He later attended two boarding high schools in the [[Greater Toronto Area|Toronto Area]], Canada: [[Upper Canada College]] and [[Appleby College]].<ref name=Yarbrough/> Upon graduation from Appleby, Harlan returned to the U.S. and in 1916 enrolled at [[Princeton University]]. There, he was a member of the [[Ivy Club]], served as an editor of ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'', and was class president during his junior and senior years.<ref name=Yarbrough/> After graduating from the university in 1920, he received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which he used to attend [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref name="Leitch">[[#Leitch1978|Leitch 1978]], pp. ?</ref> He studied jurisprudence at Oxford for three years, returning from England in 1923.<ref name=Dorsen139/> Upon his return to the United States, he began work with the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland (now known as [[Dewey & LeBoeuf]]), one of the leading law firms in the country, while studying law at [[New York Law School]]. He received his law degree in 1924 and earned admission to the bar in 1925.<ref name=Yarbrough1>[[#Yarbrough2|Yarbrough]], 1992, pp. 13<U+2013>16</ref> 

Between 1925 and 1927, Harlan served as Assistant [[U.S. Attorney]] for the [[Southern District of New York]],<ref name=FDC/> heading the district's [[Prohibition]] unit.<ref name=Yarbrough1/> He prosecuted [[Harry M. Daugherty]], former United States Attorney General.<ref name=Dorsen139/> In 1928, he was appointed Special Assistant [[Attorney General of New York]], in which capacity he investigated a scandal involving sewer construction in [[Queens]].<ref name=FDC/> He prosecuted [[Maurice E. Connolly]], the Queens [[borough president]], for his involvement in the affair.<ref name=papers>{{cite web|url=http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/finding_aids/harlan/|title=John Marshall Harlan Papers|publisher=[[Princeton University]] Library|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}</ref>  In 1930, Harlan returned to his old law firm, becoming a partner one year later. At the firm, he served as chief assistant for senior partner [[Emory Buckner]] and followed him into public service when Buckner was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. As one of "Buckner's Boy Scouts", eager young Assistant United States Attorneys, Harlan worked on Prohibition cases, and swore off drinking except when the prosecutors visited the Harlan family fishing camp in [[Quebec]], where Prohibition did not apply.<ref name = "tame"/> Harlan remained in public service until 1930, and then returned to his firm. Buckner had also returned to the firm,<ref name = "tame"/> and after Buckner's death, Harlan became the leading [[trial lawyer]] at the firm.<ref name=Dorsen139/>

As a trial lawyer Harlan was involved in a number of famous cases. One such case was the conflict over the estate left after the death in 1931 of [[Ella Wendel]], who had no heirs and left almost all her wealth estimated at 30<U+2013>100&nbsp;million to churches and charities. However a number of claimants, filed suits in state and federal courts demanding a part of her fortune. Most of the claimants were imposters; Harlan acted as the main defender of her estate and will as well as the chief negotiator. Eventually a settlement among lawful claimants was reached in 1933.<ref name=Yarbrough41>[[#Yarbrough2|Yarbrough]], 1992, pp. 41<U+2013>51</ref> In the following years Harlan specialized in corporate law dealing with the cases like ''Randall v. Bailey'',<ref name=Randall>288 N.Y. 280, 43 N.E.2d 43 (1942)</ref> which was about the interpretation of a state law governing distribution of corporate [[dividends]].<ref name=Yarbrough2/>  In 1940, he represented the New York Board of Higher Education in its unsuccessful effort to retain [[Bertrand Russell]] on the faculty of the [[City College of New York]]; Russell was declared "morally unfit" to teach.<ref name="Leitch"/> The future justice also represented boxer [[Gene Tunney]] in a breach of contract suit brought by a would-be fight manager, a matter settled out of court.<ref name = "tame"/><ref name=Yarbrough2>[[#Yarbrough2|Yarbrough]], 1992, pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>

In 1937, Harlan was one of five founders of the controversial [[Pioneer Fund]], a group associated with [[eugenics]] advocacy, and served on its board for long time. He, however, never played any significant role in the fund.<ref name=Tucker>[[#Tucker|Tucker]], 2002, pp. 6, 51<U+2013>53</ref>

During World War II, Harlan volunteered for military duty, serving as a [[colonel]] in the [[United States Air Force|United States Army Air Force]] from 1943 to 1945. He was the chief of the [[Operational Analysis]] Section of the Eighth Air Force in England.<ref name=Dorsen139/> He won the [[Legion of Merit]] from the United States, and the Croix de guerre from both [[Croix de guerre 1939<U+2013>1945|France]] and [[War Cross (Belgium)|Belgium]].<ref name=Dorsen139/> In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing [[Du Pont family]] family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas.<ref name=Dorsen139/><ref name="Leitch"/> During this time Harlan also served as chairman of a committee of the [[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]]. Later he was elected vice president of it. Harlan's main specialization at that time was [[corporate law|corporate]] and [[anti-trust law]].<ref name=Dorsen139/>

==Personal life==
In 1928, Harlan married Ethel Andrews, who was the daughter of Yale history professor [[Charles McLean Andrews]].<ref name=Yarbrough33/> This was the second marriage for her. Ethel was originally married to a New York architect Henry K. Murphy, who was twenty years her elder. After Ethel divorced Murphy in 1927, her brother John invited her to a Christmas party at [[Dewey Ballantine|Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland]],<ref name=Yarbrough3>{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Brian|title=Interview with Tinsley Yarbrough, the author of ''John Marshall Harlan: Great Dissenter of the Warren Court''|year=1992|publisher=National Cable Satellite Corporation| url=http://www.booknotes.org/Watch/25755-1/Tinsley+Yarbrough.aspx|accessdate=December 30, 2011}}</ref> where she met John Harlan for the first time. They saw each other regularly after that party and eventually married on November 10, 1928 in [[Farmington, Connecticut]].<ref name=Yarbrough33/> 

Harlan, a [[Presbyterian]], maintained a New York City apartment, a summer home in [[Weston, Connecticut]] and a fishing camp in [[Murray Bay, Quebec]],<ref name=Yarbrough2/> a lifestyle he described as "awfully tame and correct".<ref name = "tame"/>  The justice played golf, favored tweeds, and wore a gold watch which had belonged to the first Justice Harlan.<ref name = "tame">{{Cite news

==Supreme Court career==
On January 13, 1954, United States President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] nominated Harlan to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], to fill a vacancy created by the death of Judge [[Augustus Noble Hand]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on February 9, and took office on February 10.<ref name=FDC>{{cite web|url=http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/tGetInfo?jid=979| publisher=Federal Judicial Center|title=Marshall, John Harlan|accessdate=August 14, 2008}}</ref> Harlan knew this court well, as he had often appeared before it and was friendly with many of the judges.<ref name = "tame"/> However, his stay on the court only lasted for a year.

[[File:John Marshall Harlan II.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Harlan]]
Harlan's nomination came shortly after the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/347/483/case.html Brown v. Board of Education]'',<ref name=Brown>{{ussc|347|483|1954}}</ref> declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary]], James Eastland, and several southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and [[civil rights]].<ref name=dorsen2006>[[#Dorsen2|Dorsen]], 2006</ref> Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views.

On the Supreme Court, Harlan often voted alongside Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]],<ref name=Vasicko/> who was his principal mentor on the court.<ref name=Yarbrough3/> Some legal scholars even viewed him as "Frankfurter without mustard", though others recognize his own important contributions to the evolution of the legal thought.<ref name=Vasicko/> Harlan was an ideological adversary<U+2014>but close personal friend<U+2014>of Justice [[Hugo Black]],<ref name=oyez>{{cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/justices/john_m_harlan2|author=Goldman, Jeremy|title=Harlan, John M.|accessdate=August 14, 2008|publisher=Oyez}}</ref> with whom he disagreed on a variety of issues, including the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the states, the Due Process Clause, and the [[Equal Protection Clause]].<ref name=Yarbrough1989/>

Justice Harlan was very close to the [[law clerks]] whom he hired, and continued to take an interest in them after they left his chambers to continue their legal careers. The justice would advise them on their careers, hold annual reunions, and place pictures of their children on his chambers' walls. He would say to them of the Warren Court, "We must consider this only temporary," that the Court had gone astray, but would soon right itself.<ref name = "tame"/>

Justice Harlan is remembered by people, who worked with him, for his tolerance and civility. He treated his fellow Justices, clerks and attorneys representing parties with respect and consideration. While Justice Harlan often strongly objected to certain conclusions and arguments, he never criticized other justices or anybody else personally, and never said any disparaging words about someone's motivations and capacity.<ref name=Dorsen_civility>[[#Dorsen|Dorsen]], 2002, pp. 147, 156, 162.</ref>  Harlan was reluctant to show emotion, and was never heard to complain about anything.<ref name = "tame"/>  Harlan was one of the intellectual leaders of the Warren Court. Harvard Constitutional law expert [[Paul Freund]] said of him:
<blockquote>His thinking threw light in a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.<ref name=Time>{{cite news|author=Staff writer|title=The Judges' Judge|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,877560,00.html|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc.|date=June 10, 1972|accessdate=April 15, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

==Jurisprudence==
Harlan's jurisprudence is often characterized as conservative. He held [[precedent]] to be of great importance, adhering to the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' more closely than many of his Supreme Court colleagues.<ref name=Vasicko/> Unlike Justice Black, he eschewed strict [[textualism]]. While he believed that the original intention of the Framers should play an important part in constitutional adjudication, he also held that broad phrases like "liberty" in the Due Process Clause could be given an evolving interpretation.<ref name=Dripps125>[[#Dripps|Dripps]], 2005, pp. 125<U+2013>131</ref>

Harlan believed that most problems should be solved by the [[political process]], and that the judiciary should play only a limited role.<ref name=Yarbrough1989/> In his dissent to ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'',<ref name=Reynolds>{{ussc|377|533|1964|pin=589}}, Harlan J., dissenting</ref> he wrote: 

<blockquote>These decisions give support to a current mistaken view of the Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should take the lead in promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, be thought of as a general haven of reform movements.<ref name=Reynolds/></blockquote>

===Equal Protection Clause===
The Supreme Court decided several important equal protection cases during the first years of Harlan's career. In these cases, Harlan regularly voted in favor of civil rights<U+2014>similar to his grandfather, the only dissenting justice in the infamous ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' case.<ref name=Plessy>{{ussc|163|537|1896|pin=552}}, Harlan J., dissenting</ref>

He voted with the majority in ''[[Cooper v. Aaron]]'',<ref name=Cooper>{{ussc|358|1|1958|pin=4}}</ref> compelling defiant officials in [[Arkansas]] to [[desegregate]] public schools. He joined the opinion in ''[[Gomillion v. Lightfoot]]'',<ref name=Gomillion>{{ussc|364|339|1960}}</ref> which declared that states could not redraw political boundaries in order to reduce the voting power of African-[[United States|Americans]]. Moreover, he joined the unanimous decision in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'',<ref name=Loving>{{ussc|388|1|1967}}</ref> which struck down state laws that banned interracial marriage.

===Due Process Clause===
Justice Harlan advocated a broad interpretation of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]'s Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected a wide range of fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution.<ref name=Wildenthal2>[[#Wildenthal|Wildenthal]], 2000, p. 1463</ref> (See [[Due process#Substantive due process|substantive due process]].) However, as Justice [[Byron White]] noted in his [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Moore v. East Cleveland]]'', "no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field.'"<ref name=Moore>{{ussc|431|494|1977|pin=544}}, White, B., dissenting</ref> Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of [[federalism]] and [[separation of powers]] have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms."<ref name=Griswold>{{ussc|381|479|1965|pin=501}}, Harlan, J., concurring in the judgment</ref>

Harlan set forth his interpretation in an often cited dissenting opinion to ''[[Poe v. Ullman]]'',<ref name=Poe>{{ussc|367|497|1961|pin=522}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> which involved a challenge to a [[Connecticut]] law banning the use of [[contraceptive]]s. The Supreme Court dismissed the case on technical grounds, holding that the case was not [[ripeness|ripe]] for adjudication. Justice Harlan dissented from the dismissal, suggesting that the Court should have considered the merits of the case. Thereafter, he indicated his support for a broad view of the due process clause's reference to "liberty." He wrote, "This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the [[right to keep and bear arms]]; the freedom from unreasonable [[searches and seizures]]; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary [[impositions]] and purposeless [[Prior restraint|restraint]]s."<ref name=Poe/> He suggested that the due process clause encompassed a right to privacy, and concluded that a prohibition on contraception violated this right.<ref name=Dripps>[[#Dripps|Dripps]], 2005, p. 144</ref>

The same law was challenged again in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]''.<ref name=Griswold/> This time, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, and concluded that the law violated the Constitution. However, the decision was based not on the due process clause, but on the argument that a right to privacy was found in the "[[penumbra]]s" of other provisions of the Bill of Rights. Justice Harlan concurred in the result, but criticized the Court for relying on the Bill of Rights in reaching its decision. "The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands," he wrote, "on its own bottom."<ref name=Griswold/> The Supreme Court would later adopt Harlan's approach, relying on the due process clause rather than the penumbras of the Bill of Rights in right to privacy cases such as ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''<ref name=Roe>{{ussc|410|113|1972}}</ref> and ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.<ref name=Lawrence>{{ussc|539|558|2003}}</ref>

Harlan's interpretation of the Due Process Clause attracted the criticism of Justice Black, who rejected the idea that the Clause included a "substantive" component, considering this interpretation unjustifiably broad and historically unsound. The Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan, and has continued to apply the doctrine of substantive due process in a wide variety of cases.<ref name=Yarbrough1989>[[#Yarbrough|Yarbrough]], 1989, Chapter 3, The bill of rights and the states</ref>

===Incorporation===
{{See also|Incorporation (Bill of Rights)}}
Justice Harlan was strongly opposed to the theory that the Fourteenth Amendment "incorporated" the Bill of Rights<U+2014>that is, made the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states.<ref name=Cortner/> His opinion on the matter was opposite to that of his grandfather, who supported the full incorporation of the Bill of Rights.<ref name=Wildenthal>[[#Wildenthal|Wildenthal]], 2000</ref> When it was originally ratified, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in the 1833 ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]''.<ref name=Barron>{{ussc|32|243|1833}}</ref> Some jurists argued that the Fourteenth Amendment made the entirety of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states as well. Harlan, however, rejected this doctrine, which he called "historically unfounded" in his ''Griswold'' concurrence.<ref name=Griswold/> 

Instead, Justice Harlan believed that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause only protected "fundamental" rights. Thus, if a guarantee of the Bill of Rights was "fundamental" or "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," Harlan agreed that it applied to the states as well as the federal government.<ref name=Vasicko/> Thus, for example, Harlan believed that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s [[free speech]] clause applied to the states,<ref name=ONeil/> but that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s self incrimination clause did not.<ref name=Vasicko/> 

Harlan's approach was largely similar to that of Justices [[Benjamin Cardozo]] and [[Felix Frankfurter]].<ref name=Vasicko/> It drew criticism from Justice Black, a proponent of the total incorporation theory.<ref name=Yarbrough/> Black claimed that the process of identifying some rights as more "fundamental" than others was largely arbitrary, and depended on each Justice's personal opinions.<ref name=oyez/> 

The Supreme Court has eventually adopted some elements of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states<U+2014>the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, an increasing number of rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation. (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings.) Hence, majority of provisions of the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the [[Third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Third Amendment]], the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]], the excessive bail provision of the Eighth Amendment, the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], and the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.<ref name=Cortner>[[#Cortner|Cortner]], 1985</ref>

===First Amendment===
Justice Harlan supported many of the Warren Court's landmark decisions relating to the [[separation of church and state]]. For instance, he voted in favor of the Court's ruling that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in ''[[Torcaso v. Watkins]]''.<ref name=Torcaso>{{ussc|367|488|1961}}</ref> He joined in ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'',<ref name=Engel>{{ussc|370|421|1962}}</ref> which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official [[prayer in school|prayers in public schools]]. In ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/393/97/case.html#114 Epperson v. Arkansas]'',<ref name=Epperson>{{ussc|393|97|1968|pin=114}}, Harlan, J., concurring</ref> similarly, he voted to strike down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of [[evolution]].

In many cases, Harlan took a fairly broad view of First Amendment rights such as the freedom of speech and of the press, although he thought that the First Amendment applied directly only to the federal government.<ref name=ONeil>[[#O'Neil|O'Neil]], 2001</ref>  According to Harlan the freedom of speech was among the "fundamental principals of liberty and justice" and therefore applicable also to states, but less stringently than to the national government. Moreover, Justice Harlan believed that federal laws censoring "obscene" publications violated the free speech clause.<ref name=ONeil/> Thus, he dissented from ''[[Roth v. United States]]'',<ref name=Roth>{{ussc|354|476|1957|pin=496}}, Harlan, J., concurring in the result in No. 61, and dissenting in No. 582</ref> in which the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a federal obscenity law. At the same time, Harlan did not believe that the Constitution prevented the states from censoring obscenity.<ref name=ONeil63>[[#O'Neil|O'Neil]], 2001, pp. 63<U+2013>64</ref> He explained in his ''Roth'' dissent: 
<blockquote>The danger is perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' goes so far beyond the acceptable standards of candor that it will be deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of [[D. H. Lawrence]] seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so seems to me to be intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.<ref name=Roth/></blockquote>

Harlan concurred in ''[[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]'',<ref name=Sullivan>{{ussc|376|254|1964}}</ref> which required public officials suing newspapers for [[slander and libel|libel]] to prove that the publisher had acted with "[[actual malice]]." This stringent standard made it much more difficult for public officials to win libel cases. He did not, however, go as far as Justices Hugo Black and [[William O. Douglas]], who suggested that all libel laws were unconstitutional. In ''Street v. New York'',<ref name=Street>{{ussc|394|576|1969}}</ref> Harlan wrote the opinion of the court, ruling that the government could not punish an individual for insulting the [[American flag]]. In 1969 he noted that the Supreme Court had consistently "rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication."<ref name=Abrams>[[#Abrams|Abrams]], 2005, pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref>

When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955,<ref name=Flynn>[http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/784731 216 F.2d 354]</ref> he authorized the decision upholding conviction of leaders of the [[communist party]] (including [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]]) under the [[Smith Act]]. The ruling was based on the previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. Later, when he was a the Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of communist party activists as unconstitutional in the case known as ''[[Yates v. United States]]''.<ref name=Yates>{{ussc|354|298|1957|pin=300}}</ref> Another such case was ''[[Watkins v. United States]]''.<ref name=Watkins>{{ussc|354|178|1957}}</ref>

Harlan penned the [[majority opinion]] in ''[[Cohen v. California]]'',<ref name=Cohen>{{ussc|403|15|1971}}</ref> holding that wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words "Fuck the [[Conscription in the United States|Draft]]" was speech protected by the First Amendment. His opinion was later described by constitutional law expert Professor [[Yale Kamisar]] as one of the greatest ever written on freedom of expression.<ref name = "tame"/>  In the ''Cohen'' opinion, Harlan famously wrote "one man's [[vulgarity]] is another's [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]," a quote that was later denounced by [[Robert Bork]] as "[[moral relativism]]".<ref name=Bork>{{cite web|url=http://ctlibrary.com/1198|title=Conversations: Robert Bork says, Give me liberty, but don't give me filth|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=May 19, 1997|accessdate=April 12, 2009}}</ref> Robert Bork was famously refused confirmation to the Supreme Court by the Senate because of his extreme views.

Justice Harlan is credited for the establishing that the First Amendment protects the freedom of association.<ref name=ONeil/> In ''[[NAACP v. Alabama]]'',<ref name=NAACP>{{ussc|357|449|1958}}</ref> Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court, invalidating an Alabama law that required the [[NAACP]] to disclose membership lists.<ref name=ONeil/> However he did not believe that individuals were entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights wherever they pleased. He joined in ''Adderley v. Florida'',<ref name=Adderley>{{ussc|385|39|1966}}</ref> which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from ''[[Brown v. Louisiana]]'',<ref name=Brown1>{{ussc|383|131|1966|pin=151}}, Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice Harlan, and Mr. Justice Stewart join dissenting</ref> in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines]]'',<ref name=Tinker>{{ussc|393|503|1969|pin=526}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in public schools.

===Criminal procedure===
During the 1960s the Warren Court made a series of rulings expanding the rights of criminal [[defendant]]s. In some instances, Justice Harlan concurred in the result,<ref name=Gideon>{{ussc|372|335|1963|pin=349}}, Harlan, J., concurring</ref> while in many other cases he found himself in dissent. Harlan was usually joined by the other moderate members of the Court: Justices [[Potter Stewart]], [[Tom C. Clark|Tom Clark]], and [[Byron White]].<ref name=Vasicko>[[#Vasicko|Vasicko]], 1980</ref>

Most notably, Harlan dissented from Supreme Court rulings restricting [[interrogation]] techniques used by law enforcement officers. For example, he dissented from the Court's holding in ''[[Escobedo v. Illinois]]'',<ref name=Escobedo>{{ussc|378|478|1964|pin=492}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> that the police could not refuse to honor a suspect's request to consult with his lawyer during an interrogation. Harlan called the rule "ill-conceived" and suggested that it "unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement." He disagreed with ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'',<ref name=Miranda>{{ussc|384|436|1965|pin=504}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> which required law enforcement officials to warn a suspect of his rights before questioning him (see [[Miranda warning]]). He closed his dissenting opinion with a quotation from his predecessor, Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]]: "This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added."<ref name=Miranda/>

In ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'',<ref name=Gideon/> Justice Harlan agreed that the Constitution required states to provide attorneys for defendants who could not afford their own counsel. However, he believed that this requirement applied only [[trial|at trial]], and not [[appeal|on appeal]]; thus, he dissented from ''[[Douglas v. California]]''.<ref name=Douglas>{{ussc|372|353|1963|pin=360}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref>

Harlan wrote the majority opinion ''[[Leary v. United States]]''<U+2014>a case that declared [[Marijuana Tax Act]] unconstitutional based on the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection against [[self-incrimination]].<ref name=Leary>{{ussc|395|6|1969}}</ref>

Justice Harlan's concurrence in ''[[Katz v. United States]]''<ref name=Katz>{{ussc|389|347|1967}}</ref> set forth the test for determining whether government conduct constituted a [[Search and seizure|search]]. In this case the Supreme Court held that [[eavesdropping]] of the [[petitioner]]'s telephone conversation constituted a search in the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and thus required a [[search warrant|warrant]].<ref name=Vasicko/> According to Justice Harlan, there is a two-part requirement for a search: 1. That the individual have a subjective expectation of privacy; and 2. That the individual's expectation of privacy is "one that society is prepared to recognize as 'reasonable.'"<ref name=Katz/>

===Voting rights===
{{See also|Gerrymandering}}
Justice Harlan rejected the theory that the Constitution enshrined the so-called "[[one man, one vote]]" principle, or the principle that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population.<ref name=Hickok>[[#Hickok|Hickok]], 1991, pp. 5<U+2013>7</ref> In this regard, he shared the views of Justice Felix Frankfurter, who in ''[[Colegrove v. Green]]''<ref name=Colegrove>{{ussc|328|549|1946|pin=556}}</ref> admonished the courts to stay out of the "political thicket" of [[reapportionment]]. The Supreme Court, however, disagreed with Harlan in a series of rulings during the 1960s. The first case in this line of rulings was ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/369/186/case.html#266 Baker v. Carr]''.<ref name=Baker>{{ussc|369|186|1962|pin=266}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> The Court ruled that the courts had [[jurisdiction]] over [[malapportionment]] issues and therefore were entitled to review the validity of district boundaries. Harlan, however, dissented, on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that malapportionment violated their individual rights.<ref name=Baker/>

Then, in ''[[Wesberry v. Sanders]]'',<ref name=Wesberry>{{ussc|376|1|1964|pin=20}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> the Supreme Court, relying on the Constitution's requirement that the [[United States House of Representatives]] be elected "by the People of the several States," ruled that [[congressional district]]s in any particular state must be approximately equal in population. Harlan vigorously dissented, writing, "I had not expected to witness the day when the Supreme Court of the United States would render a decision which casts grave doubt on the constitutionality of the composition of the House of Representatives. It is not an exaggeration to say that such is the effect of today's decision."<ref name=Wesberry/> He proceeded to argue that the Court's decision was inconsistent with both the history and text of the Constitution; moreover, he claimed that only Congress, not the judiciary, had the power to require congressional districts with equal populations.<ref name=Hickok/>

Harlan was the sole dissenter in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'',<ref name=Reynolds/> in which the Court relied on the [[Equal Protection Clause]] to extend the one man, one vote principle to state legislative districts. He analyzed the language and history of the Fourteenth Amendment, and concluded that the Equal Protection Clause was never intended to encompass voting rights. Because the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] would have been superfluous if the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] (the basis of the reapportionment decisions) had conferred a general [[right to vote]], he claimed that the Constitution did not require states to adhere to the [[one person, one vote|one man, one vote]] principle, and that the Court was merely imposing its own political theories on the nation. He suggested, in addition, that the problem of malapportionment was one that should be solved by the political process, and not by litigation. He wrote: 

<blockquote>This Court, limited in function in accordance with that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, in the name of constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.<ref name=Reynolds/></blockquote>

For similar reasons, Harlan dissented from ''Carrington v. Rash'',<ref name=Carrington>{{ussc|380|89|1965|pin=97}}, Harlan, J., dissenting</ref> in which the Court held that voter qualifications were subject to scrutiny under the equal protection clause. He claimed in his dissent, "the Court totally ignores, as it did in last Term's reapportionment cases [...] all the history of the Fourteenth Amendment and the course of judicial decisions which together plainly show that the Equal Protection Clause was not intended to touch state electoral matters."<ref name=Carrington/> Similarly, Justice Harlan disagreed with the Court's ruling in ''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/383/663/case.html#680 Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]'',<ref name=Harper>{{ussc|383|663|1966|pin=680}}</ref> invalidating the use of the [[poll tax]] as a qualification to vote.

==Retirement and death==
John M. Harlan's health began to deteriorate towards the end of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s.<ref name=Dean>[[#Dean|Dean]], 2001</ref> To cover this, he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once  when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'').<ref name="man"/> Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.<ref name=Dorsen139/>

Harlan died from [[spinal cancer]]<ref name=Time/> three months later, on December 29, 1971.<ref name=papers/> He was buried at the Emmanuel Church Cemetery in [[Weston, Connecticut]].<ref name="Christensen">[http://web.archive.org/web/20050903032026/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c20_e.html Christensen, George A.

Despite his many dissents, Harlan has been described as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices of the twentieth century.<ref name=Yarbrough0>[[#Yarbrough2|Yarbrough]], 1992</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1960.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780<U+2013>2010: Chapter H |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterH.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref> Harlan's extensive professional and Supreme Court papers (343 cubic feet) were donated to [[Princeton University]], where they are housed at the Seely G.
