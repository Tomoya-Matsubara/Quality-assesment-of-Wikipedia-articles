'''HMS ''Princess Royal''''' was the second of two {{sclass|Lion|battlecruiser}}s built for the [[Royal Navy]] before World War I. Designed in response to the {{sclass|Moltke|battlecruiser|2}}s of the German Navy, the ships significantly improved on the speed, armament, and armour of the preceding {{sclass|Indefatigable|battlecruiser|4}}. The ship was named for The [[Princess Royal]], a title occasionally granted to the Monarch's eldest daughter.{{sfn|Silverstone|p=258}}

Laid down in 1912 and commissioned in 1913, ''Princess Royal'' served in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] a month after the war began. She was then sent to the Caribbean to prevent the [[German East Asia Squadron]] from using the [[Panama Canal]]. After the East Asia Squadron was sunk at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, ''Princess Royal'' rejoined the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]]. During the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], ''Princess Royal'' scored only a few hits, although one crippled the German [[armoured cruiser]] {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}}. Shortly afterwards, she became the [[flagship]] of the 1st Battlecruiser [[Squadron (naval)|Squadron]], under the command of [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Osmond Brock]].

''Princess Royal'' was moderately damaged during the [[Battle of Jutland]] and required a month and a half of repairs. Apart from providing distant support during the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in 1917, the ship spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols of the [[North Sea]]. ''Princess Royal'' was placed into reserve in 1920, then was sold for [[ship breaking|breaking up]] as [[scrap]] in 1922 to meet the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].

== Design ==

The ''Lion''-class battlecruisers, nicknamed the "Splendid Cats",{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=29}} were designed by [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Philip Watts]], the [[Director of Naval Construction]], to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the ''Moltke'' class as the German ships were to the [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible'' class]]. The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 70% increase in size over the ''Indefatigable'' class and made them the largest warships in the world.{{sfn|Burt|p=151}}

=== General characteristics ===

[[File:Lion class battleship - Jane's Fighting Ships, 1919 - Project Gutenberg etext 24797.png|thumb|left|Left elevation and deck plan from the 1918 ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]''|alt=Left elevation and deck plan of three-stacked battlecruiser]]

''Princess Royal'' was significantly larger than her predecessors. She had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|700|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|88|ft|6.75|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|32|ft|5|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. The ship normally displaced {{convert|26270|LT|t}} and {{convert|30820|LT|t}} at deep load, over {{convert|8000|LT|t|-2}} more than the earlier ships. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|5.95|ft|1}} at deep load.{{sfn|Roberts|pp=43<U+2013>45}}

=== Propulsion ===

''Princess Royal'' had two paired sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] direct-drive steam turbines housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of a high-pressure ahead-and-astern turbine driving an outboard shaft, and a low-pressure ahead-and-astern turbine driving an inner shaft. Designed power was {{convert|70000|shp|lk=in|0}} for a speed of {{convert|28|kn}}.{{sfn|Roberts|pp=33, 76}} In September 1912, ''Princess Royal'' began her [[sea trial]]s and developed {{convert|78803|shp|abbr=on}} for a speed of {{convert|28.5|kn}}.{{sfn|Roberts|pp=76, 78, 80}} During maximum power trials in July 1913, the battlecruiser achieved {{convert|96238|shp|abbr=on}} for a speed of {{convert|27.97|kn}} while at the unusually high displacement of {{convert|29660|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Roberts|p=79}}

The steam plant consisted of 42 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler#Yarrow|large-tube boilers]] arranged in seven boiler rooms.{{sfn|Roberts|pp=70<U+2013>76}} Maximum [[wikt:bunker|bunkerage]] was {{convert|3500|LT|t}} of coal and an additional {{convert|1135|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate.{{sfn|Roberts|p=76}} At {{convert|10|kn}}, the ship's range was {{convert|5610|nmi}}.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=29}}

=== Armament ===

''Princess Royal'' was armed with eight [[BL 13.5 inch /45 naval gun|BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns]] ("BL" for [[List of British ordnance terms#BL|breech-loading]]) in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'X' from bow to stern. Her secondary armament consisted of 16 [[BL 4 inch naval gun Mk VII|BL 4-inch Mk VII guns]], most of which were mounted in [[casemate]]s in the superstructure.{{sfn|Roberts|p=83}} The two guns mounted on the deck above the forward group of casemates were fitted with [[gun shield]]s in 1913 and 1914 to better protect their crews from enemy fire. The starboard [[aft]]er {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} gun was removed in early 1917,{{sfn|Burt|p=161}} fitted to a high-angle [[gun mount|mount]] capable of 60<U+00B0> of elevation, and returned in April along with a second, similarly modified gun from ''Princess Royal''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}}.{{sfn|Roberts|p=83}} Two submerged [[torpedo tube]]s were fitted on the [[broadside]], and fourteen [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]] were carried.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=29}}{{sfn|Roberts|p=83}}

[[File:3inch20cwtAAGunHMASAustraliaDecember1918.jpeg|thumb|A 3-inch 20 cwt AA gun on the quarterdeck of {{HMAS|Australia|1911|6}}]]

The battlecruiser was built without [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) guns, but from October 1914 to December 1916 she was fitted with a single [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] gun ("QF" for [[Quick-firing gun|quick-firing]]) on a high-angle mount, which had a maximum depression of 8<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 60<U+00B0>.{{sfn|Roberts|p=83}} Its {{convert|6|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell was fired at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1765|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} and a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. It had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|10000|ft|m}}, but an effective range of only {{convert|3600|ft}}.{{sfn|Buxton|p=235}} A single [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|QF 3-inch 20 cwt]]<ref name="cwt" group="lower-alpha"/> AA gun was added in January 1915 and carried until April 1917. Its high-angle mount had a maximum depression of 10<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 90<U+00B0>. The gun fired a {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2500|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 12 to 14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of {{convert|23500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Campbell|1985|p=61}}

''Princess Royal'' received a [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]] between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their guns on the target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier for the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.{{sfn|Roberts|pp=92<U+2013>93}}

By early 1918, ''Princess Royal'' carried a [[Sopwith Pup]] and a [[Sopwith 1<U+00BD> Strutter]] on [[Flight deck#Early flight decks|flying-off ramps]] fitted on top of 'Q' and 'X' turrets. The Pup was intended to shoot down [[Zeppelin]]s while the 1<U+00BD> Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance.{{sfn|Layman|pp=114<U+2013>15}} Each platform had a canvas [[hangar]] to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.{{sfn|Roberts|p=92}}

=== Armour ===

The armour protection given to ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' was heavier than on the ''Indefatigable''s. The waterline [[Belt armour|belt]] of [[Krupp cemented armour]] measured {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} thick amidships; this thinned to 4&nbsp;inches towards the ships' ends, and did not reach the bow or stern. The upper armour belt had a maximum thickness of 6&nbsp;inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to {{convert|5|in|mm|0}} abreast of the end turrets. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by {{convert|8|to|9|in|mm|0}} of armour, except for the turret roofs which used {{convert|2.5|to|3.25|in|mm|0}}. The thickness of the nickel steel deck ranged from {{convert|1|to|2.5|in|mm|0}}. Nickel steel [[torpedo bulkhead]]s {{convert|2.5|in|mm|0}} thick were fitted abreast of the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and shell rooms. The sides of the conning tower were {{convert|10|in|0}} thick.{{sfn|Roberts|pp=109, 112}} After the [[Battle of Jutland]] revealed a vulnerability to plunging shellfire, 1&nbsp;inch of additional armour, weighing approximately {{convert|100|LT|t|0}}, was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs.{{sfn|Roberts|p=113}}

== Service ==
=== Pre-war career ===

''Princess Royal'' was laid down at the [[Vickers]] Shipyard in [[Barrow-in-Furness]] on 2 May 1910. She was launched on 29 April 1911 by [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Princess Louise, The Princess Royal]], and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 14 November 1912.{{sfn|Roberts|p=41}} She cost <U+00A3>1,955,922 plus an additional <U+00A3>120,300 for her armament.{{sfn|Burt|p=154}} Upon commissioning, ''Princess Royal'' joined the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which was renamed the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]] (BCS) in January 1913. Rear-Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]] assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913. The squadron, including ''Princess Royal'', visited [[Brest, France|Brest]] in February 1914 and ports in Russia during June.{{sfn|Burt|p=161}}

=== World War I ===
==== Battle of Heligoland Bight ====

{{main|Battle of Heligoland (1914)}}

''Princess Royal'' first saw combat during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. She was part of Admiral Beatty's battlecruiser force, which was originally to provide distant support to the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast if the German [[High Seas Fleet]] [[sortie]]d in response. The battlecruisers headed south at full speed at [[12-hour clock|11:35 a.m.]]<ref name="UTC" group="lower-alpha"/> when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule, as the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the [[Bar (river morphology)|bar]] at the mouth of the [[Jade Estuary]]. The British light cruiser {{HMS|Arethusa|1913|2}} had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers {{SMS|Strassburg||2}} and {{SMS|K<U+00F6>ln|1909|2}} when Beatty's battlecruisers appeared out of the mist at 12:37 p.m. ''Strassburg'' was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but ''K<U+00F6>ln'' was quickly crippled by the squadron's guns. Before ''K<U+00F6>ln'' could be sunk, Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the German light cruiser {{SMS|Ariadne||2}} directly to his front, and ordered pursuit. ''Ariadne'' was reduced to a burning hulk after only three salvos at less than {{convert|6000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Massie|pp=109<U+2013>13}}

''Princess Royal'' sailed from [[Cromarty]] on 28 September to rendezvous with a Canadian troop convoy bound for the United Kingdom. She rejoined the 1st BCS on 26 October, but was detached again a few days later to reinforce the [[North America and West Indies Station|North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons]] in the search for Admiral [[Maximilian von Spee|Graf Spee]]'s German East Asia Squadron after it [[Battle of Coronel|destroyed the West Indies Squadron]] on 1&nbsp;November 1914. ''Princess Royal'' arrived at [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] on 21 November, then spent several days off New York City before she steamed down to the Caribbean to guard against the possibility that Graf Spee would use the [[Panama Canal]]. The East Asia Squadron was [[Battle of the Falkland Islands|sunk off the Falkland Islands]] on 7 December, and ''Princess Royal'' left [[Kingston, Jamaica]] to sail to the UK on 19 December.{{sfn|Roberts|p=123}}

==== Battle of Dogger Bank ====

{{main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}
[[File:Battle of Dogger Bank (1915) Map.png|thumb|left|350px|<center>Positions in the battle</center>]]

On 23 January 1915 a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] sortied to clear the [[Dogger Bank]] of any British vessels that might be collecting intelligence on German movements. The British [[Room 40|were reading the German coded messages]], and a large battlecruiser force under Admiral Beatty, aboard ''Lion'', sailed to intercept. Contact was initiated at 7:20 a.m. on the 24th, when the British light cruiser ''Arethusa'' spotted the German light cruiser {{SMS|Kolberg||2}}. By 7:35, the Germans had seen Beatty's force; Hipper, aboard {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}}, ordered his ships south at {{convert|20|kn}}, thinking that he could outpace any British battleships, and could increase to ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''{{'}}s maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn}} if the pursuing ships were battlecruisers.{{sfn|Massie|pp=376<U+2013>84}}

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, ''Lion'', ''Princess Royal'' and {{HMS|Tiger|1913|2}}, pursued at {{convert|27|kn}}, and ''Lion'' opened fire at 8:52 at a range of {{convert|20000|yd}}. The other ships followed a few minutes later but the extreme range and decreasing visibility meant they did not start scoring hits until 9:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire two minutes later at a range of {{convert|18000|yd}} and concentrated their fire on ''Lion'', hitting her once. At 9:35, Beatty signalled to "engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line", but ''Tiger''{{'}}s captain, believing that {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|2}} was already engaging ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', fired at {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}, as did ''Lion'', which left {{SMS|Moltke||2}} unengaged and able to fire on ''Lion'' without risk. ''Moltke'' and {{SMS|Derfflinger||2}} combined their fire to badly damage ''Lion'' over the next hour, even with ''Princess Royal'' attacking ''Derfflinger''.{{sfn|Massie|pp=386<U+2013>96}}

[[File:Bluecher sinkend.jpg|thumb|''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' sinking]]

Meanwhile, ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' had been heavily damaged; her speed had dropped to {{convert|17|kn}}, and her steering gear was jammed. Beatty ordered ''Indomitable'' to attack her at 10:48 a.m. Six minutes later, he spotted what he thought was a submarine [[periscope]] on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90<U+00B0> turn to port to avoid the submarine, although the submarine warning flag was not raised because most of ''Lion''{{'}}s signal [[halyard]]s had been shot away. Soon afterwards ''Lion'' lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water, which knocked out all remaining light and power. At 11:02, Beatty had flags hoisted signalling "course north-east", to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper, and "attack the rear of the enemy". Rear-Admiral Sir [[Gordon Moore (Royal Navy officer)|Gordon Moore]], temporarily commanding the squadron from {{HMS|New Zealand|1911|2}}, thought that the signals meant to attack ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', which was about {{convert|8000|yd}} to the north-east, and ordered the four other battlecruisers away from the pursuit of Hipper's main force to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read in the smoke and haze.{{sfn|Massie|pp=398<U+2013>402}}

Beatty transferred to the destroyer {{HMS|Attack|1911|2}} at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers, reaching them shortly before ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' sank. He boarded ''Princess Royal'' at 12:20 p.m. and ordered the ships to pursue the main German force. This order was rescinded when it became clear that the time wasted in sinking ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' meant the rest of Hipper's battlecruisers would reach friendly waters before they could be caught. Beatty's battlecruisers turned for home, catching up to ''Lion'', which was limping along at {{convert|10|kn}}.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=38}}

''Princess Royal'' hit ''Derfflinger'' once, but only damaged two armour plates and caused a coal bunker to flood.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=35<U+2013>39}} She hit ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' at least twice, including the shot that crippled her, out of a total of 271 {{convert|13.5|in|adj=on|0}} shells fired during the battle, a hit rate of only 0.7%. By way of contrast, her [[sister ship|sister]] {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} made four hits out of 243 shells fired, a rate of 1.6%. She also fired two 13.5-inch [[shrapnel shell]]s at the German [[airship]] L5 as its crew attempted to bomb the sinking ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', mistaking it for a British ship,{{sfn|Campbell|1978|pp=29, 32}} despite the fact that the maximum elevation of those guns was only 20<U+00B0>.{{sfn|Campbell|1978|p=27}} ''Princess Royal'' was not damaged during the battle.{{sfn|Burt|p=162}}

==== Battle of Jutland ====

{{main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[File:Jutland1916.jpg|left|thumb|500px|Diagram of the Battle of Jutland showing the major movements]]

On 31 May 1916, ''Princess Royal'' was the flagship of Rear-Admiral [[Osmond Brock]] and the 1st BCS under Beatty's overall command;{{sfn|Campbell|1978|pp=29, 32}} they had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet to intercept a sortie by the [[High Seas Fleet]] into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 p.m., but Beatty's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 3:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east south-east, positioning the British ships to cut off the Germans' line of retreat, and signalled [[action stations]]. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to {{convert|18|kn}} to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, {{convert|60|mi}} behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=69, 71, 75}}

This began what was to be called the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than {{convert|18000|yd}} away. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'', had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The two battlecruisers engaged {{SMS|L<U+00FC>tzow||2}}, the leading German ship, while ''Derfflinger'' targeted ''Princess Royal''. The German fire was accurate from the start, with two hits on ''Princess Royal'' within the first three minutes.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=80<U+2013>82}} British gunnery was less effective; the range was incorrectly estimated as the German ships blended into the haze. ''Princess Royal''{{'}}s 'A' turret stopped working effectively early in the battle: the left gun was rendered inoperable when the breech pinion gear sheared, and the right gun misfired frequently.{{sfn|Campbell|1978|pp=29, 32}} By 3:54, the range was down to {{convert|12900|yd}}; Beatty ordered a course change two [[Boxing the compass|points]]<ref name="compass points" group="lower-alpha"/> to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=83}}

At 4:11 p.m. a torpedo fired by ''Moltke'' passed under ''Princess Royal''. Those aboard the British ship saw the torpedo's track, but incorrectly concluded that a [[U-boat]] was positioned on the opposite side of the British line (away from the German battlecruisers) and was firing towards both groups of ships. This false impression was compounded by reports of a periscope sighting by the destroyer {{HMS|Landrail|1914|6}}.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=85}} By this time, the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4:12 and 4:15, closing the range. This manoeuvre exposed ''Lion'' to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and the smoke from multiple successful hits caused ''Derfflinger'' to lose sight of ''Princess Royal'' and switch targets to {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}} at 4:16. By 4:25, the range was down to {{convert|14400|yd}} and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, ''Queen Mary'' was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=89<U+2013>91}} At 4:30, the light cruiser {{HMS|Southampton|1912|2}}, scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, they sighted the topmasts of [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Reinhard Scheer]]'s battleships, but did not report this to the fleet for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north.{{sfn|Massie|pp=598<U+2013>600}}

[[File:Derfflinger firing full salvo.jpg|thumb|''Derfflinger'' firing a full broadside]]

The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit,{{sfn|Massie|p=601}} but Beatty's ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then north-east, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the [[Grand Fleet]], and at 5:40&nbsp;p.m. opened fire again on their German counterparts. Facing the setting sun, the Germans could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north-east at 5:47.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=109}} Beatty gradually turned towards the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division to manoeuvre away from the Germans.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=130<U+2013>38}} About 6:22, ''Princess Royal'' was hit by two {{convert|305|mm|adj=on}} shells fired by the battleship {{SMS|Markgraf||2}}; one of these disabled 'X' turret and the other penetrated the ship's side armour.{{sfn|Campbell|1985|pp=153, 170<U+2013>71}} By 6:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180<U+00B0> starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=130<U+2013>38}} At 6:44, Beatty turned his ships south-east, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper's force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of ''New Zealand'', while slowing to {{convert|18|kn}} and altering course to the south.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=145}} Beatty then ordered his ships to make a complete circle to stay within visual range of the Grand Fleet.{{sfn|Brooks|p=263}} At 6:55, Scheer ordered another 180<U+00B0> turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to [[Crossing the T|cross Scheer's "T"]] and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180<U+00B0> turn at 7:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the danger precipitated by his previous turn.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=149, 157}} About this time ''Princess Royal'' fired at the leading German battlecruiser four three minutes without result.{{sfn|Campbell|1985|p=208}}

The British lost sight of the Germans until {{HMS|Castor|1915|6}} spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 8:05 p.m., then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. Hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only {{convert|8500|yd}} away. ''Inflexible'' opened fire at 8:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers.{{sfn|Tarrant|p=175}} Shortly after 8:30, the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of Rear-Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans only fired a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, and disappeared into the mist around 8:40.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=177<U+2013>78}} Beatty's battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 2:55 a.m.{{sfn|Tarrant|pp=178, 224}}

Along with the rest of the battlecruisers, ''Princess Royal'' reached [[Rosyth Dockyard]] in Scotland on the morning of 2 June, and she immediately received temporary repairs over the next eight days. She then sailed for Plymouth, where permanent repairs were completed on 15 July, and returned to Rosyth by 21 July. ''Princess Royal'' was hit nine times during the battle<U+2014>six times by ''Derfflinger'' during the "Run to the South", twice by ''Markgraf'' during the "Run to the North", and once by {{SMS|Posen||2}} just after II Battle Squadron appeared<U+2014>with 22 killed and 81 injured. The battlecruiser fired only 230 13.5-inch shells during the battle, as her visibility was often impaired by the funnel smoke and fires aboard ''Lion''. She was credited with three hits on ''L<U+00FC>tzow'' and two on {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}. A torpedo fired at the German pre-dreadnoughts failed to hit.{{sfn|Campbell|1978|pp=29, 32}}

==== Post-Jutland career ====

As the German High Seas Fleet was forbidden from taking any unnecessary risks, the majority of ''Princess Royal''{{'}}s post-Jutland activities consisted of uneventful patrols of the North Sea. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and 6 battlecruisers to their anticipated rendezvous in the North Sea;<ref name="no sources" group="lower-alpha"/> for fear that they had entered a minefield after {{HMS|Nottingham|1913|6}} was torpedoed, they turned north before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the [[Harwich Force]] under Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt|Tyrwhitt]]. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off. Both the British and German fleets returned home; two British light cruisers, HMS ''Nottingham'' and {{HMS|Falmouth|1910|2}} had been sunk by submarines, and the German [[dreadnought]] {{SMS|Westfalen||2}} had been damaged by a torpedo.{{sfn|Marder, III|pp=238<U+2013>39, 287<U+2013>96}}

''Princess Royal'' provided support for British light forces involved in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German ships. She sailed with the 1st BCS on 12 December after German destroyers sank a Norway-bound convoy earlier that day, but the British were unable to intercept and returned to base the following day.{{sfn|Newbolt|pp=169, 193}} ''Princess Royal'', along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British, and no shots were fired.{{sfn|Massie|p=748}} Starting in July 1918, the Grand Fleet was affected by the [[1918 flu pandemic]]; at one point, ''Princess Royal'' lacked sufficient healthy crewmen to sail.{{sfn|Stevens & Goldrick|p=186}}

Following the [[Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow#Surrender of the fleet|surrender of the High Seas Fleet]] at the end of the war, ''Princess Royal'' and the 1st BCS made up part of the guard force in [[Scapa Flow]].{{sfn|Marder, V|p=273}} ''Princess Royal'' was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919.{{sfn|Roberts|p=123}} The battlecruiser was placed in reserve in 1920, and an attempt to sell her to Chile later that year was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Burt|p=162}} She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922.{{sfn|Roberts|p=123}} She was sold for scrap in December 1922{{sfn|Campbell|1978|p=29}} to meet the tonnage limitations set on the Royal Navy by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]],{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=29}} and arrived at the [[ship breaking|breakers]] on 13 August 1923.{{sfn|Roberts|p=123}}
