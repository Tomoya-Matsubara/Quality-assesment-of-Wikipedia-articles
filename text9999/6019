[[Ice hockey]] tournaments have been staged at the [[Olympic Games]] since 1920. The men's tournament was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]], but was added to the [[Winter Olympic Games]] in 1924. The Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]], so the players of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to play. [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] dominated the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also powerhouses during this period. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also considered the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. Typically, tournaments started with a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round.

The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. At the [[1980 Winter Olympics]], the American team upset the Soviet Union in the "[[Miracle on Ice]]" and went on to win the gold medal. Many of Canada's top players were NHL professionals, so the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] pushed for the ability to use professional and amateur players. After several debates about the definition of what made a player professional the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games held after 1988. The NHL was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated.

In July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; it was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]]. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian]] and [[United States women's national ice hockey team|American]] teams have both dominated the event, typically losing only to each other. The NHL decided to allow its players to compete starting in 1998, and the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate it. NHL players started playing the second week and the top six teams<U+2014>Canada, the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]], [[Russia at the Olympics|Russia]], Sweden and the United States<U+2014>were given [[Bye (sports)|byes]] to the final round. This decision was controversial because it affected the chances of teams like [[Slovakia at the Olympics|Slovakia]] and [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]], who fielded several NHL players. The tournament format was changed again in [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]]; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.

==Inception as an Olympic sport==
The first Olympic ice hockey tournament took place at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH|title=Ice hockey|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> when ice hockey was still a relatively new sport. The [[Victoria Skating Rink#Ice hockey|first organized indoor game]] took place on March 3, 1875 at Montreal's [[Victoria Skating Rink]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game|year=1899|last=Farrell|first=Arthur|pages=27}}</ref> The [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), the [[Sport governing body|sport's governing body]], was created on May 15, 1908,<ref>{{Cite web|title=It all started in Paris, 1908|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/history/the-iihf.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> and the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the largest professional hockey league in the world, was formed in 1917.<ref name="NHL90th">{{citation|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/app/?service=page&page=NewsPage&articleid=344517|title=NHL celebrates 90th anniversary today|accessdate= 2008<U+2013>05<U+2013>10|last=McGourty|first=John|date= 26 November 2006|publisher=National Hockey League}}</ref> The IIHF considers the 1920 tournament to be the first [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]].

Following the [[list of IOC meetings|1921 Olympic Congress]] in [[Lausanne]], the [[1924 Winter Olympics|first Winter Olympics]] were held in 1924 in [[Chamonix]], France, though they were only officially recognized by the IOC as such in the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=2&OLGY=1924|title= Chamonix 1924|publisher= International Olympic Committee|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref> Chapter 1, article 6 of the 2007 edition of the [[Olympic Charter]] defines Winter sports as "sports which are practised on snow or ice."<ref>{{cite press release|title=Olympic Charter|publisher=International Olympic Committee|format=PDF|url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_122.pdf|accessdate=2009-03-04|date=2007-07-07}}</ref> Ice hockey and [[Figure skating at the Olympics|figure skating]] were permanently integrated in the Winter Olympics program as of the first edition.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=6787|title=This Day in History 1924: First Winter Olympics|publisher=[[A&E Television Networks]]|work=This day in History|accessdate=2008-08-01}}</ref> The IOC made the Winter Games a permanent fixture in the Olympics, although following the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] further Winter Games have been held on the third year of each Olympiad.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.utah.com/olympics/history.htm|title= Winter Olympics History|publisher= Utah Athletic Foundation|accessdate=2009-01-31}}</ref>

==Men's tournament==

The men's tournament was first held at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] and was organized by a committee that included future IIHF president [[Paul Loicq]]. There were many differences from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed,<ref name="Birth">{{cite journal|title=The Birth of Swedish Ice Hockey - Antwerp 1920|author=Hansen, Kenth|journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius|publisher=[[International Society of Olympic Historians]]|month=May|year=1996|volume=4|issue=2|pages=5<U+2013>27|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv4n2/JOHv4n2c.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> the rink was 56x18 metres (the current International standard is 61x30 metres) and two twenty minute periods were played.<ref name="Num21"/> Each side had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the [[Rover (ice hockey)|rover]].<ref name="Timeline" /> Following the tournament, the IIHF held a congress and decided to adopt the "Canadian rules"<U+2013>six men per side and three periods of play.<ref name="Birth" /> The tournament used the "Bergvall System," in which three rounds were played. The first round was an elimination tournament which determined the gold medal winner. The second round consisted of the teams that were defeated by the gold medal winner; the winner of that round was awarded the silver medal. The final round was played between teams that had lost to the gold or silver medal winners; the winner of that round the bronze medal. The system was criticized, especially in Sweden, because under the system, the Swedish team had to play six games (winning three) while the bronze medal winning Czech team only had to play three (winning one). Erik Bergvall, creator of the system, stated that it was used incorrectly and that a tournament of all of the losing teams from the first round should have played to determine which teams would also play for the silver medal.<ref name="Birth"/> Because of these criticisms, the "Bergvall System" was not used again for ice hockey after the 1920 games.<ref name="Birth"/>

In [[Ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], the tournament was played in a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin format]]. It consisted of a preliminary round and a medal round. The medals were awarded based on win-loss records during the medal round.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1924 - Winter Olympics I (Chamonix, France)|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=10263|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> The same format was used until [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], although there were small variations such as in the number of teams and games played. In [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]], the gold medal winner was decided before the final games. Because of this and several other similar occurrences, the IIHF decided to change the tournament format. During a congress in 1990, the IIHF introduced a playoff system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-89.html|title=Story #89<U+2013>Finally, there's a real final game, The IIHF adopts a playoff system|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-03|year=2008|author=[[#Podmon|Szemberg, Szymon; Podnieks, Andrew]]}}</ref> The new system was used at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] in [[Albertville]], France. Preliminary round-robin games were held and were followed by an eight-team "cup-system" style medal round which culminated in a gold medal game.<ref name="Timeline"/>
[[Image:Nagano 1998-Russia vs Czech Republic.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The 1998 gold medal game between Russia and the Czech Republic was the first played between teams consisting mainly of NHL players.]]
After the NHL allowed its players to compete at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], the format was adjusted to accommodate their schedule. Only February 7, a preliminary round without NHL players or top six teams (Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States) was held. The NHL included games on the seventh, but then halted play for the next seventeen days to allow participating players time to fly to Japan and have time to recover from fatigue.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Story #7<U+2013>NHL takes break and releases players for 1998 Olympics|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-7.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-03|year=2008|author=[[#Podmon|Szemberg, Szymon; Podnieks, Andrew]]}}</ref> The tournament format was criticized for not allowing all teams the full use of their NHL players during the entire tournament.<ref name="collapse">{{Cite web|title=Blame must be shared for Slovakia's collapse|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/2002GamesHockeyFeb02/0212_bla-sun.html|author=Garrioch, Bruce|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|work=Slam!

The [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL season]] was [[Lockout (industry)|locked out]], and eventually [[2004<U+2013>05 NHL lockout|cancelled]], because of a labour dispute between the league and the players.

The other four will play classification games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women's Tournament Schedule Proposal|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics/olympics-women.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> Each team is allowed to have between 15 and 18 skaters (forwards and defencemen) and two goaltenders.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Women's Tournament Program|url=http://www.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics/olympics-women/tournament-program.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>

The tournament was played from April 23 to April 29. Seven teams participated: [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], the [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States]], [[Switzerland men's national ice hockey team|Switzerland]], [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]], [[France national ice hockey team|France]] and [[Belgium national ice hockey team|Belgium]]. Canada chose to send the [[Allan Cup]]-winning [[Winnipeg Falcons]]. The Americans initially held a tournament to determine their representative but in the end decided to send an all-star team of players from [[Boston]], [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. The team included four Canadian-born players. The Swedish team consisted mostly of [[bandy]] players, many of whom had only started playing hockey in preparation for the tournament.<ref name="Birth" /> Using the "Bergvall System",<ref name="Num21">{{Cite web|title=Story #21<U+2013>Ice Hockey debuts at the Olympics|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-21.html|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-01|year=2008|author=[[#Podmon|Szemberg, Szymon; Podnieks, Andrew]]}}</ref> the tournament started with an elimination round to determine the gold medal winner.<ref name="Num21" /> Canada won all three games, lastly defeating Sweden and outscoring opponents 27<U+2013>1.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1920 - Summer Olympics VII (Antwerp, Belgium)|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=9346|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> In two subsequent rounds, the United States and Czechoslovakia won the silver and bronze medals respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United States is second at hockey; Victory Over Czechoslovak Team by 16 to 0 Gives Americans 3 Points in Olympics.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0CE4D81E3CEE3ABC4151DFB266838B639EDE|date=1920-04-29|accessdate=2009-03-01|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

During the run-up to the [[1948 Winter Olympics]] in St. Moritz, Switzerland, a conflict broke out between the two American hockey bodies: the American Hockey Association (AHA) and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU). The AAU, which had run amateur hockey in the United States since 1930, was expelled by the IIHF in 1947 when they refused to support the AHA's team. The AAU stated that the AHA players were "openly paid salaries" and at the time, the Olympics were strictly for amateur players.<ref name="Num82">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-82.html|title=Story #82<U+2013>USA sends two teams to the 1948 Olympics|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-01|year=2008|author=[[#Podmon|Szemberg, Szymon; Podnieks, Andrew]]}}</ref> The Swiss Olympic Organizing Committee (SOOC) had accepted the AHA's application and [[Avery Brundage]] of the [[United States Olympic Committee]] threatened to withdraw the entire American team if the AHA participated in the Olympics. The IIHF countered by threatening to withdraw hockey if the AHA were banned. The IOC suggested that both American teams be banned but the SOOC rejected this proposal. The IOC decided to switch hockey to an unofficial event but a compromise was reached that the AHA team would be allowed to compete but would not be considered official and not be able to win a medal. By the end of the tournament, the AHA team finished fourth in the standings but was disqualified.<ref name="Num82"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ice Hockey at the 1948 Sankt Moritz Winter Games: Men's Ice Hockey|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1948/ICH/mens-ice-hockey.html|publisher=sports-reference.com|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> Both Czechoslovakia and the [[RCAF Flyers]] of Canada won seven games and tied when they played each other.

The [[1964 Winter Olympics]] in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] marked the first time that Canada failed to win an Olympic medal in hockey. The 1964 Games also marked a turning point in Canadian Olympic hockey history. The Soviet Union won all seven of their games and the gold medal, but Canada, represented by a national team rather than a club, finished the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting them in a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Prior to 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference from games against teams in the medal round and under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechs. The procedure had been changed to count all games and that meant the Canadians finished fourth.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1964 - Winter Olympics IX (Innsbruck, Austria)|url=http://www.tsn.ca/olympics/feature/?fid=10273|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref> However, at the time the Olympics counted as the World Championships and under their rules, Canada should have won a bronze.<ref>{{Cite web|title='64 Team Canada gets bronze medals|url=http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/story/?id=123399&lid=sublink05&lpos=topStory_canadian_hockey|publisher=The Sports Network|date=2005-04-30|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref> In April 2005, the IIHF admitted that a mistake had occurred and announced that they had reviewed the decision and would award the 1964 Canadian team a World Championship bronze medal.<ref>{{Cite web|title=1964 Canadian Olympic hockey team to be honoured|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/04/29/olympichockey050429.html|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2005-04-29}}</ref> However, two months later, the IIHF over-turned their decision and rejected an appeal in September.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/canadian_hockey/story/?id=127513|title=IIHF denies Canada 1964 bronze|date-2005-06-05|publisher=The Sports Network|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050921/TRUTH21/TPSports/Hockey|title=IIHF backs off on giving Canadians 1964 bronze medal|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|author=Houston, William|date=2005-09-21|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

The [[1980 Winter Olympics]] returned to [[Lake Placid]], [[New York]]. Twelve teams participated in the ice hockey tournament, including Canada for the first time since 1968. The Soviet Union entered the Olympic tournament as heavy favorites, and were considered natural rivals with the American team due to the [[Cold War]]. The Americans, coached by [[Herb Brooks]] and consisting mainly of college students, tied Sweden and scored an upset win over Czechoslovakia in the preliminary round and finished with four wins and a tie. The medal round consisted of the Americans, Sweden, Finland and the Soviets, who had won all of their games in the first round.<ref name="Num1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/iihf-home/the-iihf/100-year-anniversary/100-top-stories/story-1.html|title=Story #1<U+2013>Miracle on Ice|publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation|accessdate=2009-03-02|year=2008|author=[[#Podmon|Szemberg, Szymon; Podnieks, Andrew]]}}</ref>

The tournament became most famous for the "Miracle on Ice": the February 22 medal-round game between the Soviet Union and the United States that took place at the [[Herb Brooks Arena|Olympic Center]] (now known as the Herb Brooks Arena). The Soviets took an early lead, then a 2<U+2013>1 lead, but the Americans tied the game with one second left in the first period. In the second period, Soviet goaltender [[Vladislav Tretiak]] was replaced by [[Vladimir Myshkin]]. The Soviets took the lead early in the second period and the Americans were kept in the game thanks to the goaltending of [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]]. In the final period, the Americans tied the game with a power play goal. Less than two minutes later, American captain [[Mike Eruzione]] fired a shot past Myshkin, giving them a 4<U+2013>3 lead with exactly 10 minutes to play in the contest. Craig withstood another series of Soviet shots to finish the match, though the Soviets did not remove their goalkeeper for an [[extra attacker]]. In the final seconds of the game, [[American Broadcasting Company]] sportscaster [[Al Michaels]] delivered his famous line: "Do you believe in miracles? Yes!"<ref name="Num1"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Golden Goal|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/the_golden_goal/|work=Sports Illustrated|author=Swift, E.M.|date=1980-03-03|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref>

A common myth is that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets.<ref>{{Cite web|title=College kids perform Olympic miracle|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/miracle_ice_1980.html|publisher=ESPN|author=Allen, Kevin|accessdate=2009-03-02|date=1997-12-23}}</ref> However, the medals were awarded based on points accumulated against teams that made the medal round. The Americans did not win the gold until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4<U+2013>2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets defeated Sweden and won the silver. In 2008, the IIHF picked the "Miracle on Ice" as the number-one international hockey story of the past one hundred years.<ref name="Num1"/>

Prior to the [[1984 Winter Olympics]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Yugoslavia]] there was a dispute over what made a player a professional. Four players on Canada's team had signed NHL contracts but had played less than ten games in the league and Canadian officials said that this made the eligible. The United States Olympic Committee and IOC maintained that any player contracted with a NHL team was a professional and not eligible to play. Canadian hockey official [[Alan Eagleson]] stated that the rule was only applied to North American leagues and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateur.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Eagleson upset over hockey dispute|work=The New York Times|author=Litsky, Frank|date=1984-01-25}}</ref> [[Murray Costello]] of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Canada considers hockey withdrawal|work=The New York Times|date=1984-02-05}}</ref> In the end, Canada participated and finished fourth as the Soviet Union won their sixth gold medal.<ref name="OR1984">{{cite book|title=Official Report of the Organising Committee of the XlVth Winter Olympic Games 1984 at Sarajevo|publisher=Oslobodenje|location=Sarajevo|year=1984|pages=p. 88|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1984/or1984w.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref>

Czechoslovakia split into the [[Czech Republic national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovakia]] in January 1993.

However, the Winter Olympics typically occur in February, during the NHL regular season schedule, so the majority of the players were unable to compete. Bettman "floated a concept of moving hockey to the Summer Games" but this was rejected because of the Olympic Charter.<ref name="Gamble"/> In March 1995 at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, it was agreed that NHL players could play in the Olympics starting with the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Games]] in [[Nagano, Nagano|Nagano]], Japan.<ref name="Gamble">{{Cite web|title=The N.H.L.'s Olympic Gamble; Stars' Participation in Nagano Could Raise Sport's Profile|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EFD91438F935A2575AC0A961958260&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FO%2FOlympic%20Games|author=Lapointe, Joe|work=The New York Times|date=1997-09-16|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref> The deal was officially announced by the NHL on October 2, 1995.
