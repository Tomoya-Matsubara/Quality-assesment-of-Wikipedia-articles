'''''Independence Day''''' (also known by its promotional abbreviation '''''ID4''''') is a [[1996 in film|1996]] [[science fiction film]] about a hostile [[alien invasion]] of [[Earth]], focusing on a disparate group of individuals and families as they coincidentally converge in the [[Nevada desert]] and, along with the rest of the [[human population]], participate in a last-chance retaliation effort on July 4. It was directed by [[Roland Emmerich]], who co-wrote the script with producer [[Dean Devlin]]. 

Emmerich came up with the idea for the film when he was promoting the film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' in Europe. Devlin decided to incorporate a large-scale attack into the film after questioning why aliens would travel long distances in space to Earth just to keep hidden. The film's script was written during a month-long vacation in Mexico, and principal photography for the film began in July 1995 in [[New York City]]. The film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.

The film was scheduled for release on July 3, 1996, but due to the high level of anticipation for the film, many theaters began showing it on the evening of July 2, 1996, the same day the action in the film begins. The movie's total worldwide gross was $816,969,268, which at one point was the second-highest worldwide gross of all-time. It currently holds the 19th [[List of highest-grossing films|highest worldwide gross]] for a movie all-time, and was at the forefront of the large-scale [[disaster film]] and science fiction resurgences of the mid-to-late-1990s.

==Plot==
On July 2, a mammoth [[Mother ship|alien mothership]] enters [[Geocentric orbit|orbit around Earth]] and deploys several dozen saucer-shaped "attacker" spacecraft, each {{convert|15|mi}} in width. As the destroyers take positions over some of Earth's major cities, David Levinson ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), an [[MIT]]-graduate working for a cable company in [[New York City]], discovers hidden satellite transmissions which he believes to be a timer counting down to a coordinated attack by the aliens. With the help of his ex-wife Constance Spano ([[Margaret Colin]]), a [[White House]] employee, he and his father Julius ([[Judd Hirsch]]) gain entrance into the [[Oval Office]] to warn [[President of the United States|President]] Thomas J. Whitmore ([[Bill Pullman]]) of the impending attack. The President immediately orders large-scale evacuations of the targeted cities, but the aliens attack with advanced [[directed energy weapons]] before these could occur. The President, portions of his staff, and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard [[Air Force One]] as a destroyer lays waste to [[Washington D.C]].

On July 3, the United States conducts a coordinated counterattack; the movie follows the [[VMFA-314|Black Knights]], a squadron of Marine Corps [[F/A-18 Hornet]]s, as they participate in an assault on a destroyer near the destroyed city of [[Los Angeles]]. Their weapons fail to penetrate the craft's [[Force field (science fiction)|force field]], and it responds by releasing scores of "attacker" ships which are similarly shielded and armed with [[directed-energy weapons]], and a one-sided [[dogfight]] ensues. [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] Steven Hiller (Will Smith) manages to survive the attack by luring a single attacker to the [[Grand Canyon]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Independence Day' Explodes with Action, Aliens|work=Mercury News|date=1996-07-02|author=Whitty, Stephen|page=1E}}</ref> There, he blinds the alien with the braking parachute on his jet and ejects just before running out of fuel, causing both to crash in the desert. Having parachuted to safety, he subdues the injured alien. Hiller is picked up by Russell Casse ([[Randy Quaid]]), who is traveling across the desert with a group of refugees in a convoy of [[Recreational vehicle|RV]]s. From there they take the captured alien to nearby [[Area 51]], commanded by Major Mitchell ([[Adam Baldwin]]), where the President and his remaining staff have also landed. Area 51 conceals a top secret facility housing a repaired attacker and three alien bodies recovered from [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]] in 1947. 

When lead scientist Dr. Brackish Okun ([[Brent Spiner]]) removes a "bio-mechanical" suit from the alien, the specimen regains consciousness. It attempts escape and takes control of Okun's mind, killing an examination crew in the process. When questioned by President Whitmore, it reveals through a telepathic connection that its species travels from planet to planet, destroying all life and harvesting a planet's natural resources before moving on. The alien attempts a [[psychic]] attack against Whitmore but is killed by Major Mitchell. Whitmore orders a [[nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] on all of the destroyers using [[B-2 Spirit]] bombers; the first one to be hit is the alien destroyer hovering over a deserted [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], but this too fails to penetrate the craft's shield and destroys the city instead; as a result, the remaining bombers were called back.

[[Image:Independence Day MothershipB.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The alien fighter approaches the mothership.]]
On July 4, Levinson devises a plan to use the repaired attacker to gain access to the interior of the alien mothership in space in order to introduce a [[computer virus]] and plant a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missile]] on board. This, it is hoped, will cause the shields of the Earth-based alien craft to fail long enough for the human resistance to eliminate them. Hiller volunteers to be the mission's pilot, with Levinson accompanying him to upload the virus. With satellite communications knocked out, the Americans use [[Morse code]] to coordinate an attack with the remaining forces around the world, timed to occur when the invaders' shields are set to fail. With not enough military pilots to man all available aircraft, the battle requires several volunteers, including President Whitmore and Russell, who both have previous combat flight experience. 

With the successful implantation of the virus, President Whitmore leads the American jet fighters against an alien destroyer on approach to Area 51. Although the aliens now lack shields, the fighters' supply of missiles are quickly exhausted against the colossal craft and its large complement of assault ships. The underside of the alien craft opens up as its directed energy weapon prepares to fire on the base. Russell possesses the last remaining missile, but his firing mechanism jams; changing his plan, he pilots his aircraft into the alien weapon in a [[kamikaze]] attack. The ensuing explosion causes a chain reaction which annihilates the ship. Human resistance forces around the world use the same weak point to destroy the remainder of the alien ships, while the nuclear device planted by Hiller and Levinson destroys the alien mothership soon after the duo escape. Hiller and Levinson return unharmed, crash-landing their captured alien fighter in the desert close to Area 51. The film ends as the main characters watch debris from the mothership enter the atmosphere like shooting stars.

==Production==
The idea for the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe promoting their film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]''. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a movie with content like ''Stargate'' if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated that he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and discover that 15-mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the largest cities in the world. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said "I think I have an idea for our next film."<ref name="dvd">DVD commentary</ref><ref name="ID41">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 8.</ref><ref name="EW7">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292721,00.html The 1996 Summer Movie Preview: July] ''Entertainment Weekly''. Retrieved on July 8, 2008.</ref>

Emmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that "for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field ...[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head."<ref name="ID42">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 93.</ref> Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin that if arriving from across the galaxy, "would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?"<ref name="ID42"/> The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in [[Mexico]],<ref name="ID41" /> and just one day after sending it out for consideration, [[Twentieth Century Fox]] chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay.<ref name="EW"/>  Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.<ref name="dvd"/><ref name="ID41"/> The [[Military of the United States|United States military]] was originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the Area 51 references from the script.<ref name="dvd"/> 

A then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.<ref name="EW7"/> The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than [[Digimation|computer-generated effects]] in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.<ref name="dvd"/> Many of these shots were accomplished at [[Hughes Aircraft]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], [[California]], where the film's art department, [[motion control photography]] teams, [[pyrotechnics]] team, and model shop were headquartered. The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72.</ref> The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the movie, including a 30-foot (9.1 m) destroyer model<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 54.</ref> and a version of the mother ship spanning {{convert|12|ft}}.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 121.</ref> City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards.

The aliens in the film were designed by production designer [[Patrick Tatopoulos]]. The actual aliens of the film are diminutive and based on a design Tatopoulos drew when tasked by Emmerich to create an alien that was "both familiar and completely original".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 86.</ref> These creatures wear "bio-mechanical" suits that are based on another design Tatopoulos pitched to Emmerich. These suits were {{convert|8|ft}} tall, equipped with 25 tentacles, and purposely designed to show that it could not sustain a person inside so that it would not appear to be a "man in a suit".<ref name= "Aberly and Engel p. 91">Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 91.</ref>

[[Principal photography]] began in July 1995 in New York City. A second unit gathered plate shots and [[establishing shot]]s of Manhattan, Washington D.C., an RV community in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], and the [[Very Large Array]] on the [[Plains of San Agustin]], [[New Mexico]].<ref name= "Aberly and Engel p. 91"/> The main crew also filmed in nearby [[Cliffside Park]], [[New Jersey]] before moving to the former [[Kaiser Steel|Kaiser Steel mill]] in [[Fontana, California]] to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 62.</ref> The production then moved to [[Wendover, Utah]] and [[West Wendover, Nevada]],<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 104.</ref> where the deserts doubled for [[Imperial Valley]] and the [[Wendover Airport]] doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors.<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 96.</ref> It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add "Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed "ID4" because [[Warner Bros.]] owned the rights to the title ''Independence Day'', and Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in [[dailies]], the impact of the new dialogue would help them win the rights to the title.<ref name="dvd"/> The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.<ref name="EW"/> 

The production team moved to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the [[chroma key]] technique to make it appear as if activity was happening on the other side of the glass; but the [[compositing|composited images]] were not added to the final print because production designers decided that the blue panels gave the sets a "clinical look".<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 98.</ref> The attacker hangar set contained an attacker mock-up {{convert|65|ft}} wide<ref>Aberly and Engel 1996, p. 72.</ref> that took four months to build.<ref name="EW"/> The White House interior sets used had already been built for ''[[The American President]]'' and had previously been used for ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''.<ref name="ID43"/> Principal photography completed on November 3, 1995.<ref name="EW"/> 

The movie originally depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.<ref name="dvd"/> However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course in modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F-18 instead of the bi-plane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,<ref name="dvd"/> and that seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F-18s was "just not believable".<ref>[http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00003Q43A "Independence Day."] ''amazon.ca''.

The movie was marketed with several taglines, including: "We've always believed we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were", "Earth. Take a good look. It could be your last", and "Don't make plans for August". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the movie, the first third of which was a spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as "truly brilliant".<ref name="ear">[http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=6&subsec=independence+day ''Ebert & Roeper''.] ''atthemovies.tv''.

Author Stephen Molstad wrote a tie-in novel to help promote the film shortly before its release. The novel goes into further detail on the characters, situations, and overall concept not explored in the film. The novel presents the finale of the film as originally scripted, with the character played by [[Randy Quaid]] stealing a missile and roping it to his crop duster biplane. Following the success of the film, a [[prequel]] novel entitled ''Independence Day: Silent Zone'' was written by Molstad in February 1998.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061058270 "Independence Day: Silent Zone Product Details."] ''Amazon.com''.
