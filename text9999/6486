'''Alzheimer's disease''' ('''AD'''), also called '''Alzheimer disease''' or simply '''Alzheimer's''', is the most common cause of [[dementia]], afflicting 24&nbsp;million people worldwide. Alzheimer's is a [[degenerative disease|degenerative]] and [[Terminal illness|terminal disease]] for which there is currently no known cure. In its most common form, it occurs in people over 65&nbsp;years old although a less-prevalent [[Familial Alzheimer disease|early-onset form]] also exists.<ref name="pmid16360788">

The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are generally reported to a physician when memory-loss causes concern, and on suspecting Alzheimer<U+2019>s disease, the [[physician]] or healthcare specialists will confirm the diagnosis with a behavioral assessment and [[cognitive tests]], often followed by a [[brain scan]].<ref name="alzres">

The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease is not well understood, but is associated with [[Senile plaques|plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangles|tangles]] in the [[brain]].<ref name="pmid15184601"/> Possible causes and potential cures of the disease have been conjectured, with varying evidence supporting each claim. No treatment has been found to stop or reverse the disease, and it is not known whether current treatments slow the progression, or simply manage the symptoms. Many preventative measures have been suggested for Alzheimer's disease, but their value is unproven in reducing the course and severity of the disease. Mental stimulation, [[exercise]] and a [[balanced diet]] are often recommended, both as a possible prevention and as a sensible way of managing the disease.<ref name="prevention">

Due to the incurable and degenerative nature of the disease, care-management of Alzheimer's is essential. The role of the main [[Caregiving and dementia|caregiver]] is often taken by the spouse or a close relative.<ref name="glam"/> Caregivers may themselves suffer from [[stress]], over-work, [[Clinical depression|depression]], and being physically hit or struck.<ref name="burden1"/>

==Characteristics==
The disease course is typically divided into four stages, with a different pattern of cognitive and [[functional]] [[impairment]] occurring at each stage.

===Predementia===
Detailed [[neuropsychology|neuropsychological]] testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills clinical criteria of [[diagnosis]].<ref>Preclinical phase

==Causes==
Most cases of Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit familial inheritance.  At least 80% of sporadic AD cases involve genetic risk factors.  Inheritance of the <U+03B5>4 [[allele]] of the [[apolipoprotein E]] (ApoE) gene is regarded as a risk factor for development of up to 50% of late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's.  The presence of this gene allele along with infection by [[Herpes simplex]] virus type 1 (HSV-1) further increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  Several viral-host interactions are postulated, most relating to HSV-1<U+2019>s targeting of Alzheimer<U+2019>s susceptibility genes.<ref>{{cite journal

Five to ten percent of AD cases involve a clear familial pattern of inheritance in which the patient has at least two first-degree relatives with a history of AD.  These cases often have an early age of onset (usually younger than sixty years).  Nearly 200 different mutations in the [[presenilin]]-1 or presenilin-2 genes have been documented in over 500 families.  Mutations of presenilin 1 (PS1) lead to the most aggressive form of [[familial Alzheimer's disease]].  Over twenty different mutations in the [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP) gene on [[chromosome 21]] can also cause early onset of the disease.  The presenilins have been identified as essential components of the [[proteolytic]] processing machinery that produces beta amyloid peptides through cleavage of APP.  Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein (peptide) called Abeta42, the main component of senile plaques in brains of AD patients.<ref>

==Pathophysiology==
{{main|Biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease}}

===Neuropathology===
[[Image:Alzheimer's disease - MRI.jpg|thumb|[[MRI]] images of a normal aged brain (right) and an Alzheimer's patient's brain (left).  In the Alzheimer brain, atrophy is clearly seen.]]
At a [[macroscopic]] level, AD is characterized by loss of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]] and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross [[atrophy]] of the affected regions, including degeneration in the [[temporal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], and parts of the [[frontal cortex]] and [[cingulate gyrus]].<ref name="pmid12934968">{{cite journal |author=Wenk GL |title=Neuropathologic changes in Alzheimer's disease |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=64 Suppl 9 |issue= |pages=7<U+2013>10 |year=2003 |pmid=12934968 |doi=}}</ref>

Both [[amyloid plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s are clearly visible by [[microscopy]] in AD brains.<ref name="pmid15184601">{{cite journal |author=Tiraboschi P, Hansen LA, Thal LJ, Corey-Bloom J |title=The importance of neuritic plaques and tangles to the development and evolution of AD |journal=Neurology |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=1984<U+2013>1989 |year=2004 |pmid=15184601 |doi=}}</ref>  Plaques are dense, mostly [[insoluble]] deposits of amyloid-beta [[protein]] and [[cell]]ular material outside and around neurons.  Tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that build up inside the nerve cell.  Though many older people develop some plaques and tangles, the brains of AD patients have them to a much greater extent and in different brain locations.<ref name="pmid8038565">{{cite journal |author=Bouras C, Hof PR, Giannakopoulos P, Michel JP, Morrison JH |title=Regional distribution of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the cerebral cortex of elderly patients: a quantitative evaluation of a one-year autopsy population from a geriatric hospital |journal=Cerebral Cortex |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=138<U+2013>150 |year=1994 |pmid=8038565 |doi=}}</ref>

===Biochemical characteristics===
Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a [[protein folding|protein misfolding]] disease, or [[proteopathy]], due to the accumulation of abnormally folded A-beta and tau proteins in the brains of AD patients.<ref name="pmid14528050">{{cite journal |author=Hashimoto M, Rockenstein E, Crews L, Masliah E |title=Role of protein aggregation in mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases |journal=Neuromolecular Medicine |volume=4 |issue=1<U+2013>2 |pages=21<U+2013>36 |year=2003 |pmid=14528050 |doi=10.1385/NMM:4:1-2:21}}</ref>  
Plaques are made of a [[peptide]] called [[beta-amyloid]] (also A-beta or A<U+03B2>), a [[protein]] fragment snipped from a larger protein called [[amyloid precursor protein]] (APP). APP is a [[transmembrane protein]]; which means that it sticks through the neuron's membrane; and is believed to help neurons grow, survive and repair themselves after injury.<ref name="pmid16822978">{{cite journal |author=Priller C, Bauer T, Mitteregger G, Krebs B, Kretzschmar HA, Herms J |title=Synapse formation and function is modulated by the amyloid precursor protein |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=26 |issue=27 |pages=7212<U+2013>7221 |year=2006 |pmid=16822978 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1450-06.2006}}</ref><ref name="pmid12927332">{{cite journal |author=Turner PR, O'Connor K, Tate WP, Abraham WC |title=Roles of amyloid precursor protein and its fragments in regulating neural activity, plasticity and memory |journal=Prog.

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]].
Healthy neurons have an internal support structure, or [[cytoskeleton]], partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell down to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A special kind of protein, tau, makes the microtubules stable through a process named [[phosphorylation]] and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]].<ref name="pmid17604998">{{cite journal |author=Hern<U+00E1>ndez F, Avila J |title=Tauopathies |journal=Cellular Molecular Life Sciences |volume=64 |issue=17 |pages=2219<U+2013>2233 |year=2007 |pmid=17604998 |doi=10.1007/s00018-007-7220-x}}</ref> In AD, tau is changed chemically, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]].

Inflammatory processes and cytokines, may also have a hand in the pathology of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Greig NH, Mattson MP, Perry T, Chan SL, Giordano T, Sambamurti K, Rogers JT, Ovadia H, Lahiri DK |title=New therapeutic strategies and drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases: p53 and TNF-alpha inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists. |journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci.|volume=1035 |issue=Dec |pages=290-315 |year=2004 |pmid=15681814  |doi=}}</ref>

===Disease mechanism===
Three major competing hypotheses exist to explain the cause of the disease.  The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is known as the [[cholinergic]] hypothesis and suggests that AD is due to reduced biosynthesis of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]].  However, the medications that treat acetylcholine deficiency only affect symptoms of the disease and neither halt nor reverse it.<ref name="pmid16644763">{{cite journal |author=Walker LC, Rosen RF |title=Alzheimer therapeutics-what after the cholinesterase inhibitors? |journal=Age Ageing |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=332<U+2013>335 |year=2006 |pmid=16644763 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afl009}}</ref>  The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support in the face of this evidence, although cholinergic effects have been proposed to initiate large-scale aggregation,<ref name="pmid15236795">{{cite journal |author=Shen ZX |title=Brain cholinesterases: II.

In 1991 the [[amyloid beta|amyloid]] hypothesis was proposed, <ref name="pmid1763432">{{cite journal |author=Hardy J, Allsop D |title=Amyloid deposition as the central event in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

Four medications are currently approved to treat the cognitive manifestations of AD by regulatory agencies, including the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMEA).  Three are [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s and the other is [[memantine]], an [[NMDA receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]] is the restoration of [[cognitive deficit]]s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his place in them.

===Caregiving===

{{Further|[[Caregiving and dementia]]}}

Since there is no cure for Alzheimer's, caregiving is an essential part of the treatment. Due to the eventual inability for the sufferer to self-care, Alzheimer's has to be carefully care-managed. Home care in the familiar surroundings of home may delay onset of some symptoms and delay or eliminate the need for more professional and costly levels of care.{{Fact|date=March 2008}} Many family members choose to look after their relative,<ref name="burden1"/> but two-thirds of nursing home residents have dementias.<ref>

Modifications to the living environment and lifestyle of the Alzheimer's patient can improve functional performance and ease caretaker burden.  Assessment by an [[occupational therapist]] is often indicated.  Adherence to simplified routines and labeling of household items to cue the patient can aid with [[activities of daily living]], while placing safety locks on cabinets, doors, and gates and securing hazardous chemicals can prevent accidents and wandering.  Changes in routine or environment can trigger or exacerbate agitation, whereas well-lit rooms, adequate rest, and avoidance of excess stimulation all help prevent such episodes.<ref>

==Epidemiology== 
Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent type of dementia in the elderly and affects almost half of all patients with dementia.  Correspondingly, advancing age is the primary risk factor for the disease.  Among people aged 65, 2<U+2013>3% show signs of the disease, while 25<U+2013>50% of people aged 85 have symptoms of Alzheimer's and an even greater number have some of the pathological hallmarks of the disease without the characteristic symptoms.  Every five years after the age of 65, the probability of having the disease doubles.<ref>

For most of the twentieth century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia.  The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference concluded that the clinical and [[pathological]] manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility of different [[etiology|etiologies]].  This eventually led to the use of ''Alzheimer's disease'' independently of onset age of the disease.<ref name="pmid9702682">{{cite journal

==Society and culture==

===Social costs===
Because the median age of the industrialized world's population is gradually increasing, Alzheimer's is a major public health challenge. Much of the concern about the solvency of governmental social safety nets is founded on estimates of the costs of caring for [[baby boomers]], assuming that they develop Alzheimer's in the same proportions as earlier generations. For this reason, money spent informing the public of available effective prevention methods may yield disproportionate benefits.<ref name="pmid11910061">

===Caregiving burden===
{{Further|[[Caregiving and dementia]]}}

The role of family [[carers|caregiver]]s has become more prominent in both reducing the social cost of care and improving the quality of life of the patient. Home-based [[elderly care|care]] also can have economic, emotional, and psychological costs to the patient's family. Although family members in particular often express the desire to care for the sufferer to the end,<ref name="glam">{{

Alzheimer's disease can incur a variety of stresses on the caregivers: typical complaints are [[stress]], depression, and an inability to cope. Reasons for these complaints can include: high-demands on the caregiver's concentration, as Alzheimer's sufferers have a decreasing regard for their own safety (and can wander when unattended, for example); the lack of gratitude received when the sufferer is unaware of the help being given; and the lack of satisfaction when the sufferer's condition does not abate. Alzheimer's sufferers can be verbally and physically aggressive, and can stubbornly refuse to be helped. Aggression in particular can lead to a temptation to retaliate, which can put both the sufferer and carer at risk. It is additionally stressful for caregivers who are friends and family to witness a sufferer lose his or her identity, and eventually be unable to recognise them.<ref name="burden1"/>

Family caregivers often give up time from work and forego pay to spend 47&nbsp;hours per week on average with the person with AD.  From a 2006 survey of US patients with [[long term care insurance]], direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average $77,500 per year.<ref>

==Research directions==
{{Main|Alzheimer's disease clinical research}}

As of 2008, the safety and efficacy of more than 400 pharmaceutical treatments are being investigated in [[clinical trial]]s worldwide, and approximately one-fourth of these compounds are in [[Phase III]] trials, which is the last step prior to review by regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=alzheimer
 |title= Clinical Trials. Found 459 studies with search of: alzheimer  
 |accessdate= 2008-03-23
 |publisher= U.S National Institutes of Health
}}</ref> It is unknown as to whether any of these trials will ultimately prove successful in treating the disease.

A critical area of clinical research is focused on treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of [[amyloid beta]] levels is a common target of compounds under investigation. [[Immunotherapy]] or [[vaccination]] for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike vaccines which seek to prevent disease, this therapy would be used to treat diagnosed patients, and is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognize, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease.<ref>Vaccination:
