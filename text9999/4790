It has been designated by [[English Heritage]] as a Grade&nbsp;I [[listed building]],<ref name=hg>{{Citation |url= http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1191528|title= Church of All Saints, Aldwincle|year=2011 |work=The National Heritage List for England |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |accessdate= 10&nbsp;May 2011}}</ref> and is under the care of the [[Churches Conservation Trust]].<ref name=cct>{{Citation | url = http://www.visitchurches.org.uk/Ourchurches/Completelistofchurches/All-Saints-Church-Aldwincle-Northamptonshire/| title = All Saints' Church, Aldwincle, Northamptonshire| accessdate = 29&nbsp;March 2011| publisher = [[Churches Conservation Trust]]}}</ref>

==History==

The church originated in the 13th&nbsp;century.  During the next century the north [[aisle]], the [[vestry]] and the [[clerestory]] were added.  In the 15th&nbsp;century the tower, porch and chapel were built.  The chapel was a [[chantry]] chapel founded by the Chambre family and dates from 1488<U+2013>89.  In 1863 the [[chancel]] was [[Victorian restoration|restored]], followed by the rest of the church in 1893.  By this time the parish of All Saints had been united with that of St Peter's, Aldwincle, and All Saints subsequently became disused.<ref name=vch>{{citation |url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66280#s3 |title= Parishes: Aldwinkle All Saints |accessdate= 23&nbsp;October 2010|editor1-last= Page|editor1-first= William |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor3-last= |editor3-first= |work= A History of the County of Northampton |volume = 3|year=1930 |series = [[Victoria County History]] |publisher= University of London & History of Parliament Trust |pages= 164<U+2013>168}}</ref>  It was declared redundant in 1976, and has been made into an architectural museum.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.east-northamptonshire.gov.uk/downloads/Aldwincle_Strategy_Statement.pdf | title = East Northamptonshire District Local Plan 1996: Aldwincle Strategy Statement| accessdate = 23&nbsp;October 2010| publisher = [[East Northamptonshire|East Northamptonshire District]]}}</ref>

==Architecture==
===Exterior===
All Saints is constructed in [[limestone]], and its roofs are covered partly in lead and partly in [[Collyweston stone slate]].  Its plan consists of a nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a chancel with a chapel to the south and a vestry to the north, and a west tower.  The tower is in four stages with [[buttress]]es at the corners.  The stages are divided by [[Course (architecture)#String course|string courses]] carved with a variety of images.  In the lowest stage is a west doorway.  Above this, in the second stage and extending into the third stage, is a three-light window.  Over this, in the third stage, is a small [[niche (architecture)|niche]].  The top stage is the largest, and is almost completely filled by bell openings on each side.  These are square-headed and double, each side containing two lights.  Above them is a [[frieze]] containing quatrefoils, a [[battlement]]ed [[parapet]], and a tall [[crocket]]ted [[pinnacle]] at each corner.  

The sides of both aisles each contain a doorway and three-light windows, and the clerestory has two square-headed two-light windows on each side.  There is a two-light window on the east and west sides of the north aisle, and at the west end of the south aisle.  The east window has four lights, and there are two-light windows in the north and south walls of the chancel.  The chapel has a four-light east window and two three-light windows in the south wall; all these contain [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] [[tracery]].  There also is a doorway in the south wall of the chapel.<ref name=vch/>

The arcades are each of three [[bay (architecture)|bays]] with the arches carried on circular [[pier (architecture)|piers]].<ref name=hg/>  There is a [[piscina]] in the south wall of the chancel, and brackets for statues on each side of the east window.  At the southeast corner of the north aisle is another piscina, this one dating from the 14th&nbsp;century, but it is damaged.  There is a third piscina in the chapel.  The [[baptismal font|font]] is octagonal and dates from the 13th&nbsp;century.
