"'''Terma'''" is the ninth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on {{nowrap|December 1, 1996}}. It was directed by [[Rob Bowman (filmmaker)|Rob Bowman]], and written by [[Frank Spotnitz]] and series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]. "Terma" featured guest appearances by [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]], [[Nicholas Lea]] and [[Fritz Weaver]]. The episode helped explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Terma" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.3, being watched by 9.8 million people in its initial broadcast.

[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agent [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) and assistant director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) attend a [[United States Senate]] hearing, while [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) attempts to escape from a Russian gulag. "Terma" is a two-part episode, continuing the plot from the previous episode, "[[Tunguska (The X-Files)|Tunguska]]".

Several scenes in "Terma" were inspired by the novels of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], while its [[tagline]]<U+2014>changed to "[[Eppur si muove|E pur si muove]]" from the usual "The truth is out there"<U+2014>is a reference to [[Galileo Galilei]]'s investigation by the [[Roman Inquisition]]. "Terma" features a climactic explosion at an oil refinery wellhead, requiring the physical effects staff to ignite a {{convert|300|ft|m}} plume of flammable liquids.

== Plot ==

Having been imprisoned in a gulag in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]], [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) learns that [[Alex Krycek]] ([[Nicholas Lea]]), the shadowy agent he was captured alongside, is in fact a double agent working for the Russians. Mulder is able to escape from the camp while taking Krycek hostage, although the two become separated in the confusion. Krycek is found by a group of men whose left arms have all been amputated, and has his arm forcibly severed to prevent his involvements in [[Colonist (The X-Files)#Black oil|black oil]] vaccination tests. 

Meanwhile, Vasily Peskow ([[Jan Rubes]]), a former [[KGB]] agent, has come out of retirement and traveled to America. While there, he assassinates Bonita Charne-Sayre, a doctor working for the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]] to develop a black oil vaccine. From here, Peskow tracks down Charne-Sayre's test subjects, testing a Russian vaccine on them before killing them to cover his tracks. 

Mulder has been able to return to America with the help of a group of Russian peasants, and rejoins his partner [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]). Scully and assistant director [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]) had been detained by a [[United States Senate]] committee seeking to uncover Mulder's whereabouts, but the committee was adjourned upon Mulder's arrival. The agents attempt to track down Peskow, following the trail of murders. However, the assassin is able to outwit the agents, and destroys the last of the oil-containing rocks seen in the previous episode in an oil-well explosion. He returns to Russia, where it is revealed that he had been hired for this task by Krycek.<ref>Edwards, p. 200<U+2013>201</ref>

The episode's title refers to [[Terma (religion)|terma]], a set of Buddhist teachings hidden from the world. Series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] felt these represented the secrets kept by the [[Syndicate (The X-Files)|Syndicate]].<ref name="inter">{{cite video |title=Interview Clip: Tunguska |work=[[The X-Files (season 4)|The X-Files: The Complete Fourth Season]] |people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (narrator) |titleyear=1996<U+2013>1997 |format=featurette|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]]}}</ref> The opening credits of the episode saw the series' usual [[tagline]] of "The truth is out there" replaced with "[[Eppur si muove|E pur si muove]]". The phrase, Italian for "and yet, it moves", is attributed to astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]], when forced by the [[Roman Inquisition]] to denounce his belief in [[heliocentrism]].<ref name="prod1"/> The episode's  gulag scenes were inspired by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s novels ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' (1973) and ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' (1963).<ref name="prod1">Meisler, p. 102</ref> 

Shots of the oil refinery seen in the episode were filmed at a thermal energy station situated in [[Port Moody]], [[British Columbia]].<ref name="prod1"/> The climactic oil-well explosion was achieved through physical effects, with crew member Dave Gauthier building a replica [[wellhead]] in a disused rock quarry, through which liquid was piped at pressures of {{convert|250|psi|Pa}}<ref name="prod1"/> to create a plume {{convert|300|ft|m}} high.<ref name="inter"/> This wellhead was rigged to spray oil-colored water for shots of the plume itself, which was switched with a remote control to a stream of kerosene and liquid propane for the shots involving the oil catching fire.<ref name="prod1"/>

Writing for [[The A.V. Club]], Zack Handlen rated the episode a B-, finding that it contained too much "vamping for time", without enough focus on any of the individual plot threads. Handlen felt that the plot thread based on the murder of the [[Well-Manicured Man]]'s doctor friend should have been the episode's focus, and derided the "pomposity" of the dialogue elsewhere in the episode.<ref name="avc">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/termawide-open,47963/ |title="Terma"/"Wide Open" {{!}} The X-Files/Millennium {{!}} TV Club |first=Zack |last=Handlen |publisher=[[The A.V.

Shearman and Pearson described the episode as "awful", noting that there "is virtually no structure to it at all". The episode's dialogue was described as being "dreadful, boring and facile", with its long, clumsy lines and "ever more complex and ever less interesting" speeches.<ref>Shearman and Pearson, pp. 89<U+2013>90</ref>
