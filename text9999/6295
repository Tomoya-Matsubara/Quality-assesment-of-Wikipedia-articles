===Background===

Leopold Weiss born on 2 July 1900 to a Jewish family in Lemberg, Galicia then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (which is currently the city of [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). Weiss was a descendant of a long line of Jewish [[rabbi]]s; however, his father, Akiva Weiss, broke from tradition and became a lawyer. Leopold received a religious education and was proficient in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from an early age, as well as familiar with [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. He studied the Jewish Bible or [[Tanakh]], the text and commentaries of the [[Talmud]], the [[Mishna]] and [[Gemara]], also delving into the intricacies of Biblical [[exegesis]] and the [[Targum]].

At the age of fourteen he made an escape from school and joined the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austrian army]] under a false name. After a week or so, his father traced him with the help of the [[police]], and he was ignominiously escorted back to [[Vienna]]{{Sfn|Road|p=56}}

===Years in Wilderness (1920-1922)===

After abandoning university in Vienna, Weiss drifted aimlessly around 1920s [[Germany]], working briefly for the expressionist film director, [[Fritz Lang]] (F.W. Murnau, according to ''The Road to Mecca''). By his own account, after selling a jointly written film script, he splurged the windfall on a wild party at an expensive Berlin restaurant, in the spirit of the times. While working as a telephone operator for an American news agency in Berlin, Weiss obtained a coveted interview with Russian author [[Maxim Gorky]]'s wife, his first published piece of journalism, after simply ringing up her hotel room.<ref name=islamicencyclopedia.org>{{cite web|title=Muhammad Asad - Islamic Encyclopedia|url=http://islamicencyclopedia.org/public/index/topicDetail/page/1/id/698}}</ref>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Muhammad Asad in 1982.jpg|thumb|300px|right]] -->

===Later years and Death===

Towards the end of his life, Asad moved to [[Spain]] and lived there with his third wife, Pola Hamida Asad, an American national of Polish Catholic descent who had also converted to Islam, until his death on 23 February 1992 at the age of 91. He was buried in the Muslim cemetery of [[Granada]] in the former [[Moorish]] province of [[Andalusia]], Spain.

===Family===

Asad had a son, [[Talal Asad]], from his second Saudi Arabian wife, Munira. Talal Asad is now an anthropologist specializing in [[religious studies]] and [[postcolonialism]]. Asad also had a step-son named Heinrich (converted name Ahmad) with his first wife Else (converted name Aziza).<ref>[http://muhammadasad.info/bintro.htm The Truth Society - Muhammed Asad]</ref>

In 1922 Weiss moved to the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], staying in [[Jerusalem]] at the house of his maternal uncle Dorian Feigenbaum at his invitation. Feigenbaum was a [[psychoanalyst]], and a disciple of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and later founded the ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]''. It was from this base that Leopold Weiss would first explore the realities of [[Islam]]. But his exploration would be prefaced by another revelation, of the perceived immoralities of [[Zionism]].<ref name=martinkramer.org>{{cite web|title=Martin Kramer|url=http://www.martinkramer.org/sandbox/reader/archives/the-road-from-mecca-muhammad-asad/}}</ref>

===Foreign Correspondent for ''Frankfurter Zeitung''===

He picked up work as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for the  [[German language|German]] [[newspaper]] [[Frankfurter Zeitung]], one of the most prestigious newspapers of [[Germany]] and [[Europe]], selling articles on a freelance basis. His pieces were noteworthy for their understanding of Arab fears and grievances against the Zionist project. He published a small book on the subject in 1924, and this so inspired the confidence of the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'' that it commissioned him to travel more widely still, to collect information for a full-scale book. Weiss made the trip, which lasted two years.

==Conversion to Islam (1926)==
Weiss's assignments led him to an ever-deepening engagement with and understanding of Islam, which, after much thought and deliberation, led to his religious conversion in 1926 in Berlin and adopting an Arabic name, Muhammad Asad.

Asad spoke of Islam thus:

<blockquote>"Islam appears to me like a perfect work of architecture. All its parts are harmoniously conceived to complement and support each other; nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking; and the result is a structure of absolute balance and solid composure."<ref name=islamicencyclopedia.org>{{cite web}}</ref>  </blockquote>

Magazine [[Saudi Aramco World]] in a 2002 essay described his journey to conversion in these words: "Two roads diverged in Berlin in the 1920's: a well-worn one to the West, the other, rarely traveled, to the East. Leopold Weiss, a gifted young writer, traveler and linguist with a thorough knowledge of the [[Bible]] and the [[Talmud]] and with deep roots in European culture, took the road eastward to [[Mecca|Makkah]]."<ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org">{{cite web}}</ref>

==Years in Arabia (1927-1931)==

After his conversion to Islam, Asad moved to [[Saudi Arabia]] making a journey by camel across the [[Arabian Desert]], from [[Tayma]] to [[Mecca]].<ref name="Lure of Mecca">{{cite web|title=Lure of Mecca|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197406/the.lure.of.mecca.htm}}</ref> He stayed there for nearly six years during which he made five [[Hajj|pilgrimages]].<ref name="Journey of lifetime">{{cite web|title=Journey of a lifetime|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199204/the.journey.of.a.lifetime.htm}}</ref> Alongside, he started writing essays for [[Swiss]] newspaper [[Neue Z<U+00FC>rcher Zeitung]], and continued to do so till 1934.{{Sfn|Banda-e-Sehrai|p=265}}

===Ibn Saud's confidant and Bolshevik allegations===

After the sudden death of his wife Elsa, Asad stayed on in the holy city where, in a chance encounter in [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque's]] library, he met [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faysal]]. On Faysal's invitation, Asad met [[Ibn Saud|King Abdulaziz]] (founder of modern [[Saudi Arabia]]); the meeting led to almost daily audiences with the King, who quickly came to appreciate Asad's knowledge, keen mind and spiritual depth.<ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org"/> Ibn Saud allowed Asad to visit the [[Najd]] region (in the King's company), which was forbidden to foreigners at that time.<ref name=yourmiddleeast.com />

In late 1928, an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] named Abdallah Damluji, who had been an adviser to Ibn Saud, submitted a report to the British on "[[Bolshevik]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] penetration" of the [[Hijaz]]. In this report, after highlighting Asad's activities in Arabia, Damluji alleged Asad of having connections with [[Bolshevik]]s: "What is the real mission which makes him endure the greatest discomforts and the worst conditions of life? On what basis rests the close intimacy between him and Shaykh Yusuf Yasin (secretary to the [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] and editor of the official newspaper ''Umm al-Qura'')? Is there some connection between von Weiss and the [[Bolshevik]] consulate in [[Jeddah|Jidda]]?" <ref name=martinkramer.org />

===Ikhwan Rebellion===

According to Asad, he did finally become a secret agent of sorts. [[Ibn Saud]] sent him on a secret mission to Kuwait in 1929, to trace the sources of financial and military assistance being provided to [[Faisal al-Duwaish|Faysal al-Dawish]] - an [[Ikhwan]] leader-turned-rebel against Ibn Saud<U+2019>s rule.<ref name=martinkramer.org /> Asad, after traveling day and night through the desert without lighting fire, reached [[Kuwait]] to collect first-hand evidence. He concluded that the [[British Empire|British]] were providing arms and money to Ad-Dawish to weaken [[Ibn Saud]] for the purpose of securing a 'land route to India' - a railroad from [[Haifa]] to [[Basra]] ultimately connecting the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref name="Welcome-Back: Umar Mukhtar">{{cite web|title=Umar Mukhtar - The Lion of the Desert|url=http://www.welcome-back.org/profile/m_asad_11.shtml}}</ref> {{Sfn|Road|p=228}}

==Years In British India and Pakistan (1932-1952)==

[[File:ChNiazAliKhan2.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad Asad (seated right) and his wife Pola Hamida Asad (seated left) at the residence of [[Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan]] in [[Jauharabad]], [[Pakistan]].  Circa 1957]]

===Adoption of Iqbal's idea===

Asad left Arabia and came to [[British India]] in 1932 where he met South Asia's premier Muslim poet, philosopher and thinker, [[Muhammad Iqbal]], who had proposed the idea of an independent Muslim state in India, which later became [[Pakistan]]. Iqbal persuaded Asad to stay on in British India and help the Muslims of India establish their separate Muslim state. Iqbal introduced Asad to [[Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan]], a philanthropist and agriculturalist, who, on the advice of Muhammad Iqbal, established the Dar-ul-Islam Trust Institutes in [[Pathankot]], India and [[Jauharabad]], Pakistan. Asad stayed on in British India and worked with both Muhammad Iqbal and Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan.<ref name="ReferenceA">Azam, K.M., ''(A Righteous Life: Founder of Dar ul Islam Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan)'', Lahore: Nashriyat, 2010 (583 pp., Urdu) [ISBN 978-969-8983-58-1]</ref>

===Internment as Enemy Alien (1939-1945) ===

When the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out in 1939, Asad's parents were arrested and, subsequently, murdered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] during the [[Holocaust]]. Asad himself was arrested in [[Lahore]] in 1939, a day after the war broke out, by the British as an enemy alien. This was despite the fact that Asad had refused German nationality after the annexation of Austria in 1938 and had insisted on retaining his Austrian citizenship. Asad spent three years incarcerated in a prison, while his family consisting of his wife, Munira, and son, Talal, after being released from detention earlier, lived under the protection of Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan at the latter's vast {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} estate in Jamalpur, 5&nbsp;km west of [[Pathankot]]. Asad was finally released and reunited with his family in Jamalpur when the Second World War ended in 1945.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Role in Pakistan Movement===

Asad supported the idea of a separate Muslim state in India and after the independence of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, in recognition for his support for Pakistan, Asad was conferred full citizenship by Pakistan and appointed the Director of the Department of Islamic Reconstruction by the Government of Pakistan,<ref name=www.mischief-films.com>{{cite web|title=Documentary: A Road To Mecca|url=http://www.mischief-films.com/presse/Aroadtomekka-Presskit.pdf}}</ref> where he made recommendations on the drafting of Pakistan's first Constitution.<ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org">{{cite web}}</ref> In 1949, Asad joined Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as head of the Middle East Division and made efforts to strengthen Pakistan's ties with the Muslim states of the Middle East. In 1952, Asad was appointed as Pakistan's Minister Plenipotentiary to the [[United Nations]] in [[New York]] - a position that he relinquished in 1952 to write his autobiography (up to the age of 32), ''The Road to Mecca''.<ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org">{{cite web}}</ref><ref name=www.thetruecall.com>{{cite web|title=The True Call|url=http://www.thetruecall.com/home/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=194}}</ref>

Asad loved Pakistan, his conception of Pakistan, even when it turned its back on him, and he never felt resentment at the treatment he had received from it. He remained a citizen<U+2013> the first citizen of Pakistan<U+2013> until the end, although he had been strongly tempted to accept the generous, spontaneous gestures of many heads of [[Islamic state|Islamic States]] to have their citizenship and [[passport]], which would have made his life so much easier.

===Career as a Diplomat===

Asad contributed so much to Pakistan<U+2019>s early political and cultural life but was unfortunately shunted from the corridors of power. He served this country as the head of the Directorate of Islamic Reconstruction, Joint Secretary of the Middle East Division in [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Foreign Office]], [[Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[United Nations]] and organizer of the International Islamic Colloquium. If one delve into the archival material of these government departments, the role played by Asad for his beloved [[Pakistan]] can be dealt with in detail.

===Marriage Controversy and Resignation===

By chance, at a reception Asad met Pola, an [[Polish American|American of Polish origin]] who was destined to become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He fell in love with her and when he came to know that she had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-[[Pakistani nationality law|Pakistani national]].<ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org">{{cite web}}</ref>  He applied through proper channel but the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, he sat down and wrote his extraordinary book entitled [[The Road to Mecca (book)|The Road to Mecca]].

During his stay in [[Switzerland]], Asad received a letter from the [[President of Pakistan]], [[Ayub Khan (field marshal)|General Ayub Khan]], who was a great admirer of his book named [[The Principles of State and Government in Islam]] (1961). In a subsequent exchange of letters, he proposed to Asad to come to Pakistan and have the membership of a seven-man group of Muslim scholars<U+2013> who both supposedly knew the world and were experts on Islam<U+2013> to advise him with regard to everyday matters as well as the drawing up of a new Islamic constitution for the country.<ref name=allamaiqbal.com>{{cite web|title=The First Citizen Of Pakistan|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/publications/journals/review/aproct09/9.htm}}</ref>   At that time, Asad was immersed in his cherished work on the [[Quran|Qur'an]], and so he regretfully declined.

After many years, Asad was again invited by another President of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia ul-Haq]], in 1983 and that was his last visit to this country. When he arrived at [[Islamabad]], which he had not yet seen, he was received at the plane with great honour and escorted to the [[Aiwan-e-Sadr|Presidency]]. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde.<ref name="islamicencyclopedia.org">{{cite web}}</ref> On one point he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in [[Lahore]] and Islamabad and at the request of the President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.

===Literary Works===

[[The Road to Mecca (book)|The Road to Mecca]], which covers his life from 1900-1932, is not the only [[autobiography]] written by Asad. He wrote another [[memoir]] tentatively [[title]]d ''Home-Coming Of The Heart''<U+2014>covering the rest of his life (1932-1992).{{Sfn|Banda-e-Sehrai|p=19}} Due to his deteriorating [[health]], Asad couldn't complete this book, and could only record his experiences up to his resignation from the [[United Nations]] [[Envoy (title)|Envoyship]]. That's why, the book consists of two parts: the first part (covering 1932-1952) is written by Asad himself, while the second part (covering 1952-1992) is written by his wife Pola Hamida ([[death|d.]] 2007). Although the book hasn't been officially [[Publishing|published]], a [[Pakistan]]i writer Ikram Chaghatai has published its [[Urdu]] translation under the title ''Muhammad Asad: Banda-e-Sehrai''.<ref name=criterion-quarterly.com />{{Sfn|Banda-e-Sehrai|p=19}}

Another book titled ''Meditations'', which was intended to clarify [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] rising from his translation [[The Message of The Qur'an]], stands unpublished as of 2013.{{Sfn|Banda-e-Sehrai|p=19}}<ref name=http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/in_memorium_muhammad_asad_1900_1992_an_intellectual_giant>{{cite web|title=IN MEMORIAM:  Muhammad Asad - An Intellectual Giant|url=http://theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/in_memorium_muhammad_asad_1900_1992_an_intellectual_giant}}</ref> Furthermore, the short book published under the [[title]] ''The Spirit of Islam'', is not a separate book but a [[publishing|republication]] of the first [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] of his book ''[[Islam at the Crossroads]]''.{{Sfn|Hofmann|p=238}}
