'''Daniel Lewis Gardella''' (February 26, 1920 - March 6, 2005) was an [[United States|American]] [[left fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played with the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] (1944-45) and [[St. Louis Cardinals]] (1950). Born in [[New York City]], he batted and threw left-handed.

==Career==
Known more for his on-field antics than his playing ability, Gardella would often walk on his hands, and perform other [[Acrobatics|acrobat]]ic stunts. He was also one of the first players to train with [[weight training|weights]]. Nevertheless, he was the first major league player who challenged baseball's [[reserve clause]] in an early chapter in the labor-management skirmishes that brought [[free agent|free agency]] and multimillion-dollar player contracts.

===MLB===
In a three-season career, Gardella compiled a .267 [[batting average]] with 24 [[home run]]s and 85 [[run batted in|RBI]] in 169 [[games played|games]]. His most productive season came in [[1945 in baseball|1945]], when he hit .272 with 18 home runs and 71 RBI in 121 games. In that season, some of his teammates included [[Ernie Lombardi]], [[Mel Ott]], [[Joe Medwick]] and [[Bill Voiselle]].  
 
===Mexican League===
But in [[1946 in baseball|1946]], the Giants were interested in players returning from [[World War II]] [[military|military service]]. Gardella had been offered [[United States dollar|$]]4,500 to play for the Giants and $10,000 to play in [[Mexico]]. He joined the [[Mexican League]], whose generous salaries also attracted major leaguers including [[pitcher]]s [[Sal Maglie]], [[Alex Carrasquel]] and [[Max Lanier]] and [[catcher]] [[Mickey Owen]]. In response, [[baseball commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Happy Chandler]] imposed a ban of at least five years on all the players who had gone to the Mexican League for violating the reserve clause. [[Shortstop]] [[Vern Stephens]] also joined the exodus but immediately returned before the season started to escape the sanction. The first player to learn of Chandler's seriousness was Owen, who returned the same year, asked for clemency , and was refused.

==MLB lawsuit==
In October [[1947 in baseball|1947]], unable to get a baseball job in the major or [[Minor league baseball|minor]] leagues after playing in Mexico, Gardella [[lawsuit|sued]] the Major League Baseball hierarchy and the Giants in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], seeking $300,000 in damages. He charged that the reserve clause was "[[monopoly|monopolistic]] and restrains trade." A year later, the case was dismissed by a federal judge who cited a 1922 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that found baseball was not a business engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of federal antitrust law. But in February 1949, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], in a 2-to-1 ruling, sent the case back to District Court and ordered a full trial on Gardella's contentions.

In June 1949, faced with the prospect of a courtroom defeat, Chandler offered amnesty to the players who had gone to the Mexican League. Gardella, warned by his lawyer that he faced a long and costly legal battle, dropped his lawsuit. He said later that he received a $60,000 settlement from baseball.

==Later years==
In 1950 Gardella signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, but was sent to the minors after one [[at bat]] and never again played major league baseball. After leaving the game, he worked in a warehouse, as a hospital [[orderly]] and as a gym trainer. 

Many years after Gardella faded from the baseball scene, the Supreme Court rejected two challenges to the reserve clause, most notably [[Flood v. Kuhn|the case]] brought by outfielder [[Curt Flood]]. But the players did win free agency in [[1976 in baseball|1976]] after a baseball arbitrator, ruling in a case brought by pitchers [[Dave McNally]] and [[Andy Messersmith]], found that players could leave their teams after playing out their contracts.

Reflecting on his lawsuit and his possible consequences in an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (c. 1990), Gardella took pride in having brought his court challenge. "I feel I let the whole world know that the reserve clause was unfair," he said. "It had the odor of peonage, even slavery."

Gardella died at age 85 from congestive heart failure in [[Yonkers, New York]].
