A '''kalpa''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning an [[aeon]], or a long period of time in [[Hindu]]  (cf. [[Hindu Time Cycles]] ) and [[Buddhist cosmology]].

There is a mention of the word "kalpa" in the earliest Hindu religious texts. It also occurs in Buddhist texts.  The Guinness Book of World Records lists the 4.32 billion year Kalpa as the longest measure of time. <ref> {{cite book | last = McWhirter | first = Norris | authorlink = Norris McWhirter  | title = Guinness Book of World Records 1981 | publisher = Sterling Publishing Co.

==Buddhism==
According to [[Visuddhimagga]], there are several explanations for types of kalpas and their duration. In the first explanation, there are four types:

# [[Ayu-Kalpa]] - a variable time span representing the life expectancy of a typical human being in a particular era or [[yuga]]. This can be as high as one [[Asankya]] or as small as 10 years. This number is directly proportional to the level of virtue of people in that era. Currently this value hovers around 100 years and is continually decreasing.
# [[Antah-Kalpa]] - time taken for one Ayu-Kalpa to grow from 10 years up to one [[Asankya]] and back to 10 years. Ending of one Antah-Kalpa (or mass-extinction) can happen in three ways where majority of the human population gets extinct:
## [[Sashthrantha-Kalpa]] - Mass extinction by wars.
## [[Durbhikshantha-Kalpa]] - Mass-extinction by hunger.
## [[Rogantha-Kalpa]] - Mass-extinction by plague.
# [[Asankya-Kalpa]] - time span of 20 Antah-Kalpas. One is equivalent to a quarter of [[Maha-Kalpa]].
# [[Maha-Kalpa]] - largest time unit in Buddhism. Ending of a Maha-Kalpa (apocalypse) can happen in three ways: fire, water and wind. It is divided into four quarters each equivalent to one [[Asankya-Kalpa]].
## First quarter - time taken for this world to form.
## Second quarter - stable duration of this world where all living beings can thrive.
## Third quarter - time taken for this world to be destroyed.
## Fourth quarter - empty time period.

In another simple explanation, there are four different lengths of kalpas. A ''regular'' kalpa is approximately 16 million years long (16,798,000 years<ref>Epstein, Ronald B.(2002). ''Buddhist Text Translation Society's Buddhism A to Z'' p. 204. Buddhist Text Translation Society. ISBN 0881393533, 9780881393538. </ref>), and a ''small'' kalpa is 1000 regular kalpas, or 16 billion years. Further, a ''medium'' kalpa is 320 billion years, the equivalent of 20 small kalpas. A ''great'' kalpa is 4 medium kalpas, or 1.28 trillion years. 

The Buddha had not spoken about the exact length of the [[Maha-kalpa]] in number of years. However, he had given several astounding analogies to understand it.

1. Imagine a huge empty cube at the beginning of a kalpa, approximately 16 miles in each side. Once every 100 years, you insert a tiny mustard seed into the cube. According to the Buddha, the huge cube will be filled even before the kalpa ends.

2. Imagine a gigantic rocky mountain at the beginning of kalpa, approximately 16 x 16 x 16 miles (dwarfing Mt. Everest). You take a small piece of silk and wipe the mountain once every 100 years. According to the Buddha, the mountain will be completely depleted even before the kalpa ends.

In one situation, some monks wanted to know how many kalpas had died so far. The Buddha gave the analogy:

1. If you count the total number of sand particles at the depths of the Ganges river, from where it begins to where it ends at the sea, even that number will be less than the number of passed kalpas.<ref> {{cite book | last = Epstein | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald B.

==Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]] (cf. [[Hindu Time Cycles]]), it is equal to 4.32 billion years, a "day of [[Brahma]]" or one thousand [[mahayuga]]s,<ref>{{cite book | last = Johnson |first = W.J. |title = A Dictionary of Hinduism | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | ISBN = 978-0-19-861025-0 |page = 165 }}</ref> measuring the duration of the world (scientists estimate the [[age of the Earth]] at 4.54 billion years). Each kalpa is divided into 14 [[manvantara]] (each lasting 306,720,000 years). Two ''kalpa''s constitute a day and night of Brahma. A "month of Brahma" is supposed to contain thirty such days (including nights), or 259.2 billion years. According to the [[Mahabharata]], 12 months of Brahma (=360 days) constitute his year, and 100 such years the life cycle of the universe. Fifty years of Brahma are supposed to have elapsed, and we are now in the ''shvetavaraha-kalpa'' of the fifty-first; at the end of a Kalpa the world is annihilated.

The [[Vayu Purana]] in chapter 21 gives a different list of 28 ''kalpa''s. It also gives an additional list of 5 more ''kalpa''s in the next chapter.
