'''Davis Tull''' is an upcoming senior football player for the Div 1 FCS [[University of Tennessee]] at Chattanooga Mocs. They play in the [[Southern Conference]] and were co-champions in 2013. Tull plays DE/LB and has been a starter since his freshman year. As a freshman in 2011 he was voted to the All-freshman conference team as well as the College Sports Journal FCS freshman all-American team.

In his sophomore season he recorded 12.5 sacks and 19 TFL's breaking school single season records for both. He was voted a first team all-American by Walter Camp and [[American Football Coaches Association|AFCA]] and multiple fan sites. He received second team all-American recognition from the Sports Network and Associated Press. He was also voted Defensive player of the year for the conference by the coaches and media and won the school's male athlete of the year award.

Coming into his junior year [[Phil Steele]] ranked Tull as the number 1 defensive end and number 7 overall player in the nation for FCS. During the Mocs game against Furman that year Tull had 3.5 sacks and 2 FF and was named national defensive player of the week by the Sports Network. He led the UTC Mocs to a co-conference championship and after the season was voted a consensus first team all-American by every major publication. He broke the school's all time sack record and was again voted the conference defensive player of the year by the league's coaches. This made Tull the first Moc to win two league player of the year honors and he became the first defensive player to repeat in the SoCon since Appalachian State<U+2019>s Dexter Coakley in 1995. He was awarded the elite defensive end award from the CPFA and also became UTC's first academic all-American in football by having above a 3.5 GPA in Exercise Science. He finished his junior season as a finalist for the Buch Buchanan award, given annually to the top defensive player in FCS. He is UTC's all-time sack leader and the active career leader in division 1 FCS football for Forced fumbles, sacks, and solo tackles for loss and is seen as a prospect for the 2015 NFL draft.
