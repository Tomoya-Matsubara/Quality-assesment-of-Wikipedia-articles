'''MV ''Geysir''''' is a U.S.-[[flag state|flagged]] [[general cargo ship|general cargo]]/[[container ship]] owned by [[TransAtlantic Lines LLC]].  Originally named ''Amazonia'', the 90-meter ship was built by American Atlantic Shipping in 1980 to serve a route from the United States to Brazil.  In 1983, the ship was seized by the Maritime Administration for nonpayment on government loans.  

In 1984, it was renamed ''Rainbow Hope'' and leased by a small startup company to serve a route between the United States and the United States military base at Keflavik, Iceland.  As ''Rainbow Hope'' the ship was central in an international disagreement between the United States and Iceland that would span years, be compared by ''The Chicago Tribune'' to the plot of the movie [[The Mouse That Roared]], and involve political personalities including [[Antonin Scalia]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsberg]], [[Ken Starr]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[George Schultz]] and [[Ronald Reagan]].<!--Mouse that roared, Dole--><ref name="kilian">{{cite news |title=Shultz Signing Iceland Pact To Soothe Mouse That Roared |first=Killian |last=Michael |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-09-24/news/8603110380_1_iceland-cod-war-mouse |format= |agency= |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |publisher=Tribune Company |location=Chicago |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=09-24-1986 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate= |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}</ref><!--Scalia, Starr --><ref name ="783F.2d1072">U.S. Court of Appeals, Washington D.C., 1986.</ref><!-- Reagan, Schultz--><ref name="eich2"/><!-- Ginsburg--><ref name="911F.2d.797"/>

After finally losing the Iceland route, the ship was renamed ''Juno'', bought by Norwegian owners and worked in the Norwegian trade from 1996 to 1999.

In 1999 the ship was bought by TransAtlantic Lines, renamed ''Geysir'' and put back on the U.S.-Iceland route, leading to further tensions between the United States and Iceland.  After the 2006 closing of the United States Naval Station in Keflavik Iceland, the ship has gone on to carrying cargo to United States activities in The Azores.

==Construction==
Then named MV ''Amazonia'', the ship's keel was laid on 1 January 1977 at Equitable Shipyard in Madisonville, Louisiana.  The hull was constructed from [[ordinary strength steel]].<ref name="abs-hull">American Bureau of Shipping 2010, Hull page</ref>  The ship was built with three general cargo holds<ref name="abs-hull"/>  with a cargo capacity of 2,945 cubic meters ([[bale capacity]]) and 3,341 cubic meters ([[grain capacity]]).<ref name="abs-cap">American Bureau of Shipping 2010, Capacity page</ref>  It has eight ballast tanks with a ballast capacity of 770 cubic meters.<ref name="abs-hull"/><ref name="abs-cap"/>  Other major features of the ship's structure include its five diesel oil tanks, two lubricating oil tanks, two potable water tanks, a chain tank, and a waste water tank.<ref name="abs-hull"/>  The ship built with two cranes, which have since been removed.<ref name="abs-lift">American Bureau of Shipping 2010, Lifting Equipment page</ref>

The ship features a [[MAN B&W Diesel]] A/S 8L28/32A [[marine diesel engine|main engine]] with eight 280mm cylinders with a 320mm stroke for maximum continuous power of 1961.98 kilowatts driving a bronze propeller.<ref name="abs-mach">American Bureau of Shipping 2010, Machinery page</ref> Electrical power is generated by two 400 kilowatt [[auxiliary generator]]s.<ref name="abs-mach"/>  

Construction of the ship was completed in 1980.<ref name="abs-gen"/>

==History==
In the early 1980s, the company American Atlantic Shipping, a wholly-owned subsidary of American Maritime Industries, built three 2,000 DWT multi-purpose ships to carry cargo between the United States and Brazil: the ''Amazonia'' and her two sister-ships, ''America'' and ''Antilla''.<ref name="seatrade">{{cite journal |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date= |year=1979 |month=May |title=Seatrade  |trans_title= |journal=|volume=9 |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |publisher=Seatrade Publications |location=Colchester, England |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref><ref name="marenglog">{{cite journal |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |date= |year=1981 |month= |title=Marine Engineering log |trans_title= |journal=|volume=86 |series= |issue= |page= |pages= |at= |publisher=Simmons-Boardman  |location=New York |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tnNWAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Amazonia%22+%22American+Atlantic+Shipping%22&dq=%22Amazonia%22+%22American+Atlantic+Shipping%22&hl=en&ei=9L1UTKzZB8qHnQe9yaTuAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg

===''Rainbow Hope''===
In May of 1984, entrepreneur Mark W. Yonge of Monmouth County [[New Jersey]] founded Rainbow Navigation with the sole purpose of serving the route between the United States and United States [[Naval Air Station Keflavik|military base]] at [[Keflavik, Iceland]].<ref name="cap1">U.S. Court of Appeals, 1986, p.1.</ref><ref name="eich1">Eichenwald 1987, p.1.</ref>  Using money he earned from a ship-chartering company, Younge chartered ''Amazonia'' from the Department of Transportation and renamed it ''Rainbow Hope''.<ref name="eich1"/>  The company consisted of one ship, a crew of 22, and seven full-time employees.<ref name="eich1"/>  Icelandic companies had serviced the Iceland route since the late 1960s.<ref name="cap1"/>  Yonge submitted a bid quoting the same rates that the Icelandic companies were charging and invoked the [[Cargo Preference Act of 1904]].<ref name="cap1"/>  Rainbow won an $11 million contract to carry 70% of the cargo on the route, and immediately began to carry cargo, operating under contract to the [[Military Sealift Command]].<ref name="cap1"/><ref name="911F.2d.797">U.S. Court of Appeals, Washington D.C., 1986.</ref>

According to an official of the [[U.S. State Department]] speaking on the condition of anonymity, "Almost right at the start, Iceland let their feelings be known about losing the business... For the Icelanders, who are entirely dependent on seagoing trade, it was an issue of national sovereignty."<ref name="eich1"/>  Minister Counselor for the Icelandic Embassy in Washington, Hordur Bjarnason informed the [[Reagan Administration]] that Iceland "could not accept that a foreign shipping company would have a monopoly on carrying the cargo to Iceland."<ref name="eich1"/>

Before ''Rainbow Hope'' ever left the pier, the Department of Transportation approached Rainbow trying to defuse the situation.<ref name="eich1"/>  The [[New York Times]] characterized the ensuing fight as Rainbow Navigation versus "the Navy, the National Security Council and the Departments of State, Defense, Justice and Transportation to the President himself."<ref name="eich1"/>  During 1985, Iceland raised the matter with the United States Department of State at least six times,<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/> including a meeting in Lisbon in June of that year between Secretary of State [[George Schultz]] and [[Foreign Minister of Iceland]] [[Geir Hallgrimsson]].<ref name="eich2">Eichenwald 1987, p.2.</ref>  Schultz described the matter as a "major irritant in U.S.-Icelandic relations"<ref name="eich1"/> and relations were strained to the point that Iceland threatened to start boarding U.S.-flag ships and to close the Keflavik base.<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/><ref name="kilian"/>

Schultz's State Department attempted to solve the problem in a number of ways.  It tried and failed to amend the 1904 Cargo Preference Act.<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/>  It made an offer to pay Icelandic shipping firms monetary damages for loss of the route, which were refused.<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/>  [[President Reagan]] asked [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John F. Lehman, Jr.]] to determine if Rainbow's claim under the Cargo Preference Act was valid,<ref name="eich1"/> and on 8 August 1985, Lehman declared Rainbow's rates to be "excessive and unreasonable."<ref name="eich2"/>  Within four days, Rainbow pressed suits in United States District Court against "the Department of the Navy and various other federal agencies" as well as "the Secretary of the Navy and various other government officials in their personal capacities."<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/>  The suits demanded [[declaratory relief|declaratory]] and [[injunctive relief]] from the federal agencies and monetary damages from the named individuals.<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/>  The [[International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots]], representing ''Rainbow Hope''{{'}}s crew, joined Rainbow in the suits.<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/> 

[[Image:Mv-geysir-3.jpg|thumb|Motor Vessel ''Geysir''|Loading containers pierside in May 2009.]]On 15 October 1985, the District Court issued its order, granting Rainbow's requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, and ordered the government to withdraw a call for new bids.<ref name ="783F.2d1072"/>   The government appealed the finding.  On 27 January 1986, the panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of appeals consisting of future Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], future [[Starr Report]] special prosecutor [[Kenneth Starr]] and Senior Circuit Judge [[Carl E. McGowan]] upheld Rainbow's victory.<ref>United States Court of Appeals, Washington D.C. District, 1986.</ref>  During the appeal, the government's attorneys conceded that Lehman's finding of Rainbow's rates to be "excessive and unreasonable" was politically motivated,<ref name="eich2"/> and the court found some arguments put forth by Shultz and Lehman "extraordinary" and having "no rational basis".<ref name="eich1"/>  In particular, Scalia wrote that the "factual basis for (Lehman's) assertion (wa)s utterly lacking."<ref name="eich2"/>  During this time, Transportation Secretary [[Elizabeth Dole]] supported Rainbow, according to the ''Chicago Tribune'', as a viable employer of United States mariners.<ref name="kilian"/>

Eight months later, the government took a different approach to solve its problem with Rainbow, in the form of the [http://untreaty.un.org/unts/144078_158780/17/6/8083.pdf 1986 Treaty Between the United States of America and the Republic of Iceland to Facilitate Their Defense Relationship]."<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>  This treaty, negotiated by future [[United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs|Secretary of Veteran Affairs]] [[Ed Derwinski]], updated the 1951 U.S.-Iceland treaty, adding an explicit exemption of the Cargo Preference Act, guaranteeing 35% of the contract would go to Icelandic companies, and giving Icelandic companies an opportunity to compete for up to 65% of the contract."<ref name="911F.2d.797"/><ref name="eich2"/><ref name="kilian"/>  At the time, Derwinski said, "If we don't solve this problem, then the U.S. will be in a [[cod wars|cod war]]".  The United States Senate ratified the treaty one day before Reagan left for Reykjavik to attend a summit meeting with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].<ref name="eich2"/> Reagan met with the President of Iceland, [[Vigdis Finnbogadottir]], before seeing Gorbachev, giving his guarantee that the majority of the contract would be returned to Icelandic shipping companies.<ref name="eich2"/>

Though a tumultuous time, ''Rainbow Hope'' kept at least part of the Iceland route from 1987 through late 1990.  In the 1987 bidding, Rainbow was the only U.S. company to bid.<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>  Bids from Icelandic competitors were lower, giving them 65% of the carriage rights, while ''Rainbow Hope'' secured the remaining 35%.<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>  The Navy changed the bidding process in a way Rainbow found unfair, and Rainbow took a new case to the Washington D.C. District Court.<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>  By May of 1988, the court had issued a [[preliminary injunction]] halting the bidding process and ordering carriage be continued under the terms of the 1987 contracts.<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>  In November 1988, the court granted a [[summary judgement]] for Rainbow, finding the new bidding system illegal.<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>  This judgement held for nearly two years, but was ultimately overturned on 24 August 1990, when a panel of Judges [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], [[Douglas H. Ginsburg]] and [[David B. Sentelle]] of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Washington D.C. District reversed the lower court's decision.<ref name="911F.2d.797"/>

====Operational incidents====
In addition to the almost non-stop succession of challenges related to the contracts on the U.S.-Iceland run, ''Rainbow Hope'' was involved in a few notable operational incidents.  

The most notable of these involves a [[labor strike]] that prevented ''Rainbow Hope'' from discharging cargo, keeping the vessel at anchor for 22 days.<ref name="strike">3rd U.S. Circuit Court, 1991.</ref>  The ship was scheduled to depart bound for Iceland on 24 September 1984, but the U.S. Government and Rainbow were aware there was the possibility of a strike by Icelandic [[longshoremen]] scheduled to begin on 4 October.<ref name="strike"/>  ''Rainbow Hope'' arrived at [[Njar<U+00F0>v<U+00ED>k]], Iceland on 8 October, while the  strike was already underway.<ref name="strike"/>  Rainbow repeatedly contacted the U.S. government for instructions, but none were given.<ref name="strike"/>  The ship remained idle at anchor for 22 days unable to discharge its cargo.<ref name="strike"/>  The strike ended on 30 October, and the cargo was delivered the next day.<ref name="strike"/>  The government paid Rainbow $266,370.50 for the delivery, but Rainbow filed suit in the 3rd Circuit Court seeking remuneration for the extra 22 days of waiting.<ref name="strike"/>  The court denied the claim, and appeals lasted until 24 June 1991, when the appeals court affirmed that decision.<ref name="strike"/>

Other operational incidents of note include a 1988 fire during a return voyage from Iceland to the United States which forced the ship to stop in Newfoundland for repairs, and a crane breakdown on 15 November 1991 during cargo operations that required repairs be made in [[Praia da Vit<U+00F3>ria]], [[Azores]].<ref name="HQ 110849">{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/rulings/rulings1992HQ0110849.html |title=HQ 110849 |author=U.S. International Trade Commission |authorlink=U.S. International Trade Commission |date=05-26-1993  |work=Rulings And Harmonized Tariff Schedule |publisher=U.S. Government |location=Washington, DC |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref><ref name="HQ 112665">{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/rulings/rulings1993HQ0112665.html |title=HQ 112665 |author=U.S. International Trade Commission |authorlink=U.S. International Trade Commission |date=05-26-1993  |work=Rulings And Harmonized Tariff Schedule |publisher=U.S. Government |location=Washington, DC |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref>

The ship's [[certificate of inspection]] was deactivated by the United States Coast Guard on 9 May 1994, rendering it unable to move.<ref name="arch-MI94018576">U.S.C.G. 2001, case number MI94018576.</ref>  On 28 March 1996, the vessel had been sold to "owners in Jamaica" and the Coast Guard prevented the ship from receiving oil and proceeding from its berth until a valid [[certificate of financial responsibility]] could be provided.<ref name="arch-MV96002382">U.S.C.G. 2001, case number MV96002382.</ref>  

In late 1996, the ship was purchased by the company [[Noro AS]] of [[Haugesund]], Norway under a NOK 6,000,000 (approximately $800,000 in 1998 U.S. dollars)<!--795 386.75 1998 USD see http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/etc/USDpages.pdf --> mortgage by [[Sparebank 1]] SR-Bank.<ref name="nis"/> On 31 December 1996, new owner registered the ship under the Norwegian International Ship Registry and wages for the journey to Norway were guaranteed by Sparebanken Rogaland.<ref name="nis">Norwegian International Ship Registry, 2010.</ref>  The ship was inspected in Hampton Roads, Virginia on 22 April 1997.<ref name="arch-PS97021194">U.S.C.G. 2001, case number PS97021194.</ref>  On 30 June 1998 it was transferred to the Norwegian Ship Registry.<ref name="nis"/>  It was spotted by amateur enthusiasts in Haugesund on 26 October 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shipphotos.co.uk/pages/rainbowhope.htm |title=Rainbow Hope |last1=Brian-Davis |first1=Edward |date=2010 |work=ShipPhotos |publisher=ShipPhotos.co.uk |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}</ref> On 12 January 1999, the ship was renamed ''Juno''.<ref name="norsk">Norwegian Ship Registry, 2010a.</ref>  On 17 November 1999, the ship was declared free of financial encumbrances and sold to the American company TransAtlantic Lines.<ref name="norskb">Norwegian Ship Registry, 2010b.</ref>

===''Geysir''===
[[File:Erupting geysir.jpg|thumb|Namesake|''Geysir'' is presumably named after [[The Great Geysir]] in Iceland.]]
In 1997, Gudmundur Kj<U+00E6>rnested decided to start a shipping company to serve the Iceland route.<ref name="morg00"/>  Then an Icelandic citizen, educated in the United States, and having worked at Van Ommeren shipping for seven years he was familiar with the route and its history.<ref name="morg00"/>  Kj<U+00E6>rnested's college roommate at [[Babson College]], Brandon C.

The company made several preparations to bid for the Iceland contract.  Rose secured a million-dollar letter of credit from the State Bank of Long Island to back early operations.<ref name="201F.3d451"/>  The company didn't yet own any ships, but did secure four letters from U.S. shipping companies pledging to supply vessels sufficient to cover the charter requirements.<ref name="201F.3d451"/>  One of the pledged vessels was the [[supply boat]] ''Native Dancer''.<ref name="201F.3d451"/>

Eight bids for the 1998 US-Iceland run were solicited by the [[Military Traffic Management Command]] on 30 January 1998, and six bids were received.<ref name="cont-98"/>  Observers speculate that the bids were from the Icelandic company Eimskip, Dutch shipping company Van Ommeren, Atlantsskip, TransAtlantic Lines, and TransAtlantic Lines Iceland.<ref name="morg00"/>  In September 1998, the [[Military Traffic Management Command]] awarded 65% of the Iceland contract to TransAtlantic Lines Iceland, the lowest overall bidder, and the remaining 35% to the TransAtlantic Lines LLC, the lowest bidder among American shipping companies.<ref name="201F.3d451"/><ref name="cont-98">Assistant Secretary of Defense (Public Affairs), 1998.</ref>  The portion awarded to TransAtlantic Lines LLC had a cumulative total value of $5,519,295 and was set to expire by 31 October 2000.<ref name="cont-98"/> 

In response to the awards, the government of Iceland lodged a protest with the U.S. State Department, arguing that "TLI was not a true Icelandic shipping company" and "lacks the necessary experience, technical capability, financial responsibility, and material connection with Iceland"<ref name="201F.3d451"/>  Shipping companies Van Ommeren Lines (USA) and Eimskip of Iceland, which had previously serviced the Iceland route, sued the United States protesting the award.<ref name="201F.3d451">District of Columbia Circuit Court, 2000.</ref>  The district court found for Van Ommeren and Eimskip, requiring the Army to re-start the bidding process.<ref name="201F.3d451"/>  TransAtlantic appealed the decision, and on 11 January 2000 the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finally securing the contract for TransAtlantic.<ref name="201F.3d451"/>
