The last '''voyage of HMCS ''Karluk''''', flagship of the [[Canadian Arctic Expedition 1913-1916|Canadian Arctic Expedition]], 
ended with the loss of the ship and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement.  On her outward voyage in August 1913 [[HMCS Karluk|''Karluk'']], a [[brigantine]] formerly used as a [[whaler]], became trapped in the [[Arctic]] ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at [[Herschel Island]]. After a long drift across the [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] and [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] seas the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of [[Wrangel Island]]. In all, eleven men died before help could reach them.

The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian-born anthropologist [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]], and had both scientific and geographic objectives. Shortly after ''Karluk'' was trapped, Stefansson and a small party  left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for [[Reindeer|caribou]].  As ''Karluk'' drifted from its fixed position it became impossible for the hunting party to return;  Stefansson then devoted himself to the expedition's other objectives, leaving the crew and staff aboard the ship under the charge of its captain, [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]]. After the sinking Bartlett organised a march to Wrangel Island, {{convert|80|mi|sigfig= 2}} away.{{#tag:ref|In the absence of any indication within the sources, all distances have been treated as statute miles and converted to km on that basis.|group= n}} Conditions on the ice were difficult and dangerous; two parties of four men each were lost in the attempt to reach the island.

After the survivors had landed, Bartlett, accompanied by a single [[Inuit|Inuk]] companion, set out across the ice to reach the [[Siberia]]n coast. From there, after many weeks of arduous travel, Bartlett eventually arrived in Alaska, but ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission for the stranded party. They survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their rescue in September 1914 three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.

Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship, and some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and the loss of their comrades. Stefansson escaped official censure and was publicly honoured for his later work on the Canadian Arctic Expedition, despite the Canadian government's reservations about the expedition's overall management. Although Bartlett was censured by an admiralty commission for taking ''Karluk'' into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former ''Karluk'' shipmates.

The Canadian Arctic Expedition was the brainchild of Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a US-based, Canadian-born [[anthropologist]] of Icelandic origin who had spent most of the years between 1906 and 1912 studying Inuit life in the remote Arctic Canada. His fieldwork had resulted in the first detailed information on the life and culture of the [[Copper Inuit]], the so-called "[[blond Eskimos]]".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Vanstone|first= James W|title= The Noice Collection of Copper Inuit Material Culture|url= http://www.archive.org/stream/noicecollectiono22vans#page/n3/mode/2up|publisher= Field Museum of Natural History (Fieldiana Series, publication no. 1455)|location= New York|issn= 0071-4739|date= July 1994|pages= 4<U+2013>5|accessdate= 8 January 2010}}</ref> Stefansson had returned home with plans for another expedition to continue his Arctic studies, and  obtained promises of financial backing totalling USD45,000 (around USD750,000 in 2010){{#tag:ref|According to Measuringworth.com, the current value of projects (such as this expedition) should be calculated using the [[GDP deflator]].

The area known as the "High Arctic" was subject to claims of sovereignty from both Norway and the United States. The Canadian government was concerned that an American-financed expedition would give the United States a legal claim to any new land discovered in the Beaufort Sea, so when Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] met Stefansson in [[Ottawa]] in February 1913 he offered to assume financial responsibility for the entire expedition.<ref name= Hen57/> The Canadian government was hopeful that the expedition would strengthen [[Territorial claims in the Arctic|Canada's claim]] to sovereignty over the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Arctic islands]].<ref name= Higgins>{{cite web|last= Higgins|first= Jenny|title= The ''Karluk'' Disaster|url= http://www.heritage.nf.ca/exploration/karluk.html|publisher= Memorial University of Newfoundland|year= 2008|accessdate= 9 January 2010}}</ref> The American sponsors agreed to withdraw, subject to an NGS condition that the Society could reclaim its rights to the expedition if Stefansson failed to depart by June 1913<U+2014>a narrow deadline which led to hurried preparations for the journey north,<ref name= Niven12/> although Stefansson maintained in his 1921 account that "forethought appeared to have anticipated every eventuality".<ref>Stefansson, p. 27</ref> The government's involvement also represented a shift in the expedition's emphasis, towards geographical exploration rather than the original purpose of ethnological and scientific studies.<ref>P<U+00E1>lsson, p. 130</ref>

===Objectives===
In a letter to the Canadian ''[[Times-Colonist|Victoria Daily Times]]'', Stefansson explained that the main object of his expedition was to explore the "area of a million or so square miles that is represented by white patches on our map, lying between [[Alaska]] and the North Pole".  The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted.<ref name= N8/> While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist [[Rudolph Martin Anderson|Rudolph Anderson]] would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.<ref name= Bartlett4>Bartlett, pp. 4<U+2013>6</ref> 

The Northern Party's ship, ''Karluk'', would proceed north from the Canadian coast, until it either found land or was stopped by ice. It would explore any land it encountered; otherwise it would follow the ice edge eastward and attempt to winter at either [[Banks Island]] or [[Prince Patrick Island]]. If the ship was trapped in the ice and forced to drift, the party would study the direction of Arctic currents and carry out oceanographic research. Meanwhile, Rudolph Anderson's party was expected to continue with the anthropological studies of the "blond Eskimo", to collect varieties of Arctic flora and fauna, to carry out geological research, and to seek open-water channels in the hope of establishing new [[trade route]]s.<ref name= Bartlett4/>

===Organisation and personnel===

Stefansson's plan was to sail the expedition's two ships, ''Karluk'' and ''Alaska'',  to the old [[whaling]] station at Herschel Island off the Canadian Arctic coast, where the final composition of the Northern and Southern Parties would be decided and where equipment and supplies would be sorted out.<ref name= Niven12/> The haste to meet the NGS deadline led to concerns among the expedition's members about the adequacy of the provision of food, clothing and equipment.<ref>Leslie, pp. 297<U+2013>98</ref> Stefansson, who was largely absent in the hectic weeks immediately before sailing and who revealed few of his plans to his team, dismissed such concerns as "impertinent and disloyal". There were disputes between Stefansson and the scientists over the chain of command; the [[Geological Survey of Canada|Canadian Geological Survey]], which had provided four scientists to the expedition, wanted these men to report to them rather than to Stefansson. Southern Party leader Rudolph Anderson threatened to resign over Stefansson's claim to the publication rights of all private expedition journals.<ref name="Henighan, pp. 60<U+2013>61">Henighan, pp. 60<U+2013>61</ref><ref name="Palsson, p. 132">P<U+00E1>lsson, p. 132</ref>

The scientific team, made up of some of the most distinguished men in their fields,  included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and the Empire.<ref name= McKinlay10>McKinlay, pp. 10<U+2013>13</ref> Only two, however, had previous polar experience: [[Alistair Mackay|Alistair Forbes Mackay]], the expedition's medical officer, had visited Antarctica with Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Nimrod Expedition|''Nimrod'' expedition]] in 1907<U+2013>09, and had been one of the party of three to discover the location of the [[South Magnetic Pole]].<ref>Riffenburgh, p. 244</ref> Another ''Nimrod'' veteran, the 46-year-old [[James Murray (biologist)|James Murray]], was Stefansson's oceanographer. Among the younger scientists were William Laird McKinlay, a 24-year-old science teacher from [[Glasgow]] who was recommended by the Scottish explorer [[William Speirs Bruce]], and Bjarn Mamen, a 20-year-old skiing champion from [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway, who was taken on as a forester, despite lacking scientific experience.<ref name= Niven12/>

Stefansson had wanted American whaling skipper [[Christian Theodore Pedersen]] to captain ''Karluk'', the ship designated for the Northern Party. When Pedersen withdrew, the captaincy was offered to 36-year-old [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]-born Robert Bartlett, an experienced polar navigator who had commanded [[Robert Peary]]'s ship on the latter's 1909 polar expedition.<ref>Fleming, pp. 354<U+2013>61</ref> Bartlett did not have time, however, to select ''Karluk's'' crew, which was hurriedly assembled from around the [[Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard|Royal Navy Dockyard]] at [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimault]] in [[British Columbia]].<ref name= N21/> McKinlay later wrote of the crew that "one was a confirmed drug addict ... another suffered from venereal disease; and in spite of orders that no liquor was to be carried, at least two smuggled supplies on board."<ref name=McKinlay10/> McKinlay worried that this crew might lack the qualities and character necessary in the arduous months ahead, concerns shared by Bartlett, whose first act on arrival in Esquimault was to fire the [[Chief Mate|first officer]] for incompetence. In his place he appointed the 22-year-old Alexander "Sandy" Anderson.<ref name= N21>Niven, pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref>

The ship, a 29-year-old [[brigantine]], was {{convert|129|ft|sigfig=2}} in length with a beam of {{convert|23|ft}}. She had been built for the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] fishing industry (''karluk'' is the [[Aleut language|Aleut]] word for "fish") and later converted for whaling, when her bows and sides had been sheathed with {{Convert|2|in|adj=on}} [[Erythrophleum chlorostachys|Australian ironwood]]. Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings,<ref>{{cite web|title= American Offshore Whaling Voyages: a database|publisher= National Maritime Digital Library|url= http://nmdl.org/projects/whsearch.cfm|accessdate= 25 January 2020}}</ref> she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice.<ref name=B2/> Writer and journalist Jennifer Niven, in her account of the expedition, describes ''Karluk'' as "far from the powerful Arctic ice vessel many of the men had expected".<ref name= N8/>

The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimault. When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work.<ref name= N8/> In addition to ''Karluk'', Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven [[schooner]], ''Alaska'', to act as a supply ship for the largely land-based Southern Party. He later added a second schooner, ''Mary Sachs'', when the hold space in ''Alaska'' proved inadequate.<ref>Jenness, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref> In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships. Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and [[Diamond Jenness]], both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with ''Karluk'', while their equipment was on board ''Alaska''. McKinlay himself, aboard ''Karluk'' as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with ''Alaska''. Stefansson insisted that all would be sorted out when the ships reached their Herschel Island rendezvous. "Heaven help us all if we failed to reach Herschel Island", McKinlay wrote.<ref name= Mc18>McKinlay, pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref>

===Towards Herschel Island===

''Karluk'' left Esquimault on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The immediate destination was [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], on the coast of [[Bering Sea]]. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention.  On 2 July ''Karluk'' reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined ''Alaska'' and ''Mary Sachs''.<ref name= N14>Niven, pp. 14<U+2013>15</ref>  While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's  attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected ''Karluk'' to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.<ref name="Henighan, pp. 60<U+2013>61"/><ref>McKinlay, pp. 15<U+2013>17</ref>

At [[Port Clarence, Alaska|Port Clarence]], just north of Nome, 28&nbsp;dogs were taken on board before ''Karluk'' sailed north on 27 July.<ref name= Mc18/> The next day she crossed the [[Arctic Circle]],<ref name= N14/> and almost immediately encountered rough weather which resulted in flooded cabins and seasickness. However, McKinlay noted that "whatever defects she had, ''Karluk'' was proving herself a fine sea-boat."<ref name = M20>McKinlay, pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref> On 31 July they reached [[Point Hope, Alaska|Point Hope]], where two Inuit hunters, known as "Jerry" and "Jimmy", joined the ship.<ref name= M20/> On 1 August the permanent Arctic [[Drift ice|ice pack]] was seen; Bartlett made several attempts to breach the ice, but each time was forced back.<ref>Niven, p. 16</ref>  On 2 August, about {{convert|25|mi}} from [[Point Barrow]], ''Karluk'' thrust her way into the ice but was soon trapped, and drifted slowly eastward for three days before reaching open water off Cape Smythe. Meanwhile Stefansson had left the ship to travel over the ice to Point Barrow. He rejoined his party at Cape Smythe on 6 August, bringing with him Jack Hadley, a veteran trapper who required passage east. Hadley, a long-time acquaintance of Stefansson's, was entered in the ship's books as carpenter.<ref name= B20>Bartlett, p. 20</ref><ref>Stefansson, p. 36</ref>

At Cape Smythe two more Inuit hunters, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the expedition, together with Keraluk's family<U+2014>wife Keruk and their two young daughters Helen and Mugpi.<ref name= N24>Niven, pp. 24<U+2013>27</ref> As the voyage proceeded, Bartlett became increasingly anxious about the extent of ice in the area, and   noted that the brass stemplates on the ship's bow had already been damaged.<ref>Bartlett, p. 23</ref> Over the next few days ''Karluk'' struggled to make headway, as Bartlett took the ship northwards away from the coast, following channels of open water.  The only scientific tasks of substance that could be carried out during this period were Murray's [[dredging]] operations, through which he collected many species of Arctic sea life, and the regular [[Sounding line|depth soundings]].<ref>McKinlay, pp. 27</ref> On 13 August Bartlett calculated their position as {{convert|235|mi}} east of Point Barrow, with a similar distance to travel to Herschel Island.<ref>Bartlett, p. 26</ref> However, this proved to be the ship's farthest point east, as at that position she became firmly trapped in the ice and began to move slowly westward; by 10 September ''Karluk'' had retreated nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}} back towards Point Barrow.<ref>Niven, p. 49</ref> Shortly afterwards, Stefansson informed Bartlett that all hopes for further progress that year had ended, and that ''Karluk'' would have to winter in the ice.<ref name= M28>McKinlay, p. 28</ref>

==In the ice==
===Drifting west===

To the right can be seen the upper parts of a ship, with heavy snow piled up at its sides.|Stefansson (foreground) and his party on their departure from ''Karluk'', 20 September 1913]]
On 19 September, with ''Karluk'' ice-bound and largely stationary, Stefansson announced that in view of the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game in the area of the [[Colville River (Alaska)|Colville River]]. He would take with him the two Inuit "Jimmy" and "Jerry", the expedition secretary Burt McConnell, the photographer [[George Hubert Wilkins|George Wilkins]], and the anthropologist Diamond Jenness.<ref>Jenness, p. 11</ref> Stefansson expected to be gone for about ten days; Bartlett was instructed by letter that, if the ship should move from its present position, he should "send a party ashore, to erect one or more beacons giving information of the ship's whereabouts."<ref>Bartlett, p. 37</ref> The next day the six men departed. On 23 September, following a blizzard, the [[Sea ice|ice floe]] in which ''Karluk'' was trapped began to move, and soon the ship was travelling at between {{convert|30|and|60|mi}} a day<U+2014>but to the west, steadily further from Herschel Island and the rest of the expedition. It became clear that Stefansson's party would not be able to find their way back to the ship.<ref name= N54>Niven, pp. 54<U+2013>56</ref><ref>P<U+00E1>lsson, p. 134</ref>

According to expedition historian S.E. Jenness (son of Diamond Jenness),<ref>Author information in ''The Making of an Explorer''</ref> the magnetician William Laird McKinlay believed that Stefansson's departure amounted to abandoning the ship to its fate. McKinlay did not suggest this publicly, but recorded it in his unpublished expedition journal and in later correspondence. Jenness rejects this view, pointing out that Stefansson and the hunting party members had left valuable property aboard ''Karluk'', and suggesting that one motive for the trip was to train the younger staff.<ref>Jenness, pp. 15<U+2013>17</ref> Anthropologist G<U+00ED>sli P<U+00E1>lsson, writing of the expedition, asserts that, while the anger of Bartlett and the crew is understandable, there is no evidence that Stefansson deliberately abandoned the men. It is arguable, P<U+00E1>lsson says, that Stefansson acted responsibly in attempting to secure a supply of fresh meat which would counter the possibility of [[scurvy]], should ''Karluk'' be trapped in the ice for a long time.<ref>P<U+00E1>lsson, p. 167</ref> Historian Richard Diubaldo writes "The evidence suggests that this was a normal hunting trip" and "...there is strong evidence to suggest he [Stefansson] wished he had never left [the ship]".<ref>Diubaldo, p. 82</ref>

The constant snow and thick mists made it difficult for Bartlett to calculate the ''Karluk's'' position accurately, although during a brief break in the weather on 30 September they glimpsed land which they took to be Cooper Island, in the vicinity of Point Barrow where they had been at the start of August.<ref>Bartlett, p. 48</ref> On 3 October the anxiety of crew and staff increased when, with Point Barrow just five miles (8&nbsp;km) distant,<ref name= N54/> the drift turned northwards, away from the land.<ref>Bartlett, p. 49</ref> There were fears among some that ''Karluk'' would repeat the experience of the ''[[USS Jeannette (1878)|Jeannette]]'', an American vessel that 30&nbsp;years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew.{{#tag:ref|For a full account of the ''Jeannette'' disaster, see Fleming, pp. 201<U+2013>29.|group= n}} Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton's ''Nimrod'' expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain's leadership. They were making plans to leave the ship at an appropriate time, and head for land on their own.<ref>Niven, pp. 61<U+2013>62</ref>

As the weather grew worse Bartlett ordered supplies and equipment to be transferred on to the ice, both to lighten the ship and as a precaution should it be necessary to abandon the vessel in a hurry.<ref>Niven, pp. 70<U+2013>78</ref><ref>McKinlay, p. 44</ref> Food supplies were augmented by seal hunts<U+2014>two or three seals a day was the average bag, according to McKinlay<U+2014>and by a single polar bear that had wandered near the ship in mid-November.<ref>McKinlay, p. 46</ref> On 15 November ''Karluk'' reached 73<U+00B0>N, the most northerly point of its drift, and then began moving south-west, in the general direction of the Siberian coast.<ref>Bartlett, p. 69</ref> By mid-December the estimated position was {{convert|140|mi}} from Wrangel Island. Despite the bleak outlook<U+2014>Bartlett was privately convinced that ''Karluk'' would not survive the winter<U+2014><ref>Niven, pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref> a determined effort was made to celebrate Christmas, with decorations, presents, a programme of sports on the ice, and a banquet.<ref>Bartlett, pp. 74<U+2013>78</ref> By then they were just {{convert|50|mi}} north of [[Herald Island (Arctic)|Herald Island]], a rocky outpost east of Wrangel Island; on 29 December land was visible in the distance, though whether this was Herald Island or Wrangel Island was not clear.<ref>Niven, p. 105</ref> The sighting of land briefly raised morale, but in the New Year the ice began breaking up and forming [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridges]]. Over the next few days, wrote McKinlay, "the twanging, drumming, ominous ice sounds got louder and nearer."<ref name= Mc63>McKinlay, pp. 63<U+2013>65</ref>

===Sinking===
Early in the morning of 10 January 1914, McKinlay records, "a severe shudder shook the whole ship" as the ice attacked the hull. Bartlett, still hoping to save his ship, gave orders to lighten her by removing all accumulated snow from the decks.<ref name= Mc63/> He also ordered all hands to have warm clothing ready. At 6.45 in the evening a loud bang indicated that the hull had been punctured; Bartlett went immediately to the engine room and observed water pouring in through a gash {{convert|10|ft}} long. There was no possibility that the pumps could deal with the inflow, and the captain gave the order to abandon ship.<ref name= Mc63/><ref>Niven, pp. 117<U+2013>118</ref> Weather conditions, says McKinlay, could hardly have been worse, but the crew and staff worked throughout the night, in pitch darkness and driving snow, to add to the quantities of rations and equipment already stashed on the ice. Bartlett remained on board until the last moments, playing loud music on the ship's [[Victor Talking Machine Company#The Victrola|Victrola]]. At 3.15 pm in the afternoon of 11 January, Bartlett put on [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Chopin's Funeral March]] as a final salute to the ship, and stepped off. ''Karluk'' sank within minutes, her [[Yard (sailing)|yardarms]] snapping off as she disappeared through the narrow hole in the ice.<ref>Bartlett, pp. 90<U+2013>91</ref> McKinlay took stock of the stranded party: 22 men, one woman, two children, 16 dogs and a cat.<ref name="McKinlay, p. 68"/>{{#tag:ref|The cat, named by the crew Nigeraurak ("Little Black One"), had come on board at Esquimault, and had been adopted by fireman Fred Maurer.

Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as "Shipwreck Camp", was more or less established by the time ''Karluk'' sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow [[igloo]] with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases.<ref name= M68/> To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from ''Karluk's'' engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers.<ref>See rough plan drawn by McKinlay. Bartlett, p. 98</ref> In McKinlay's words, the camp provided "substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time."<ref name= M68>McKinlay, pp. 68<U+2013>70</ref> Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.<ref>Niven, p. 129</ref>

Amid this activity  Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat,  played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible.<ref>Niven, p. 131</ref> Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island.<ref>Niven, pp. 133<U+2013>38</ref> A party of four, led by ''Karluk's'' first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarn Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, {{convert|38|mi|km}} from their intended destination. This was the last sighting of Anderson's party; their ultimate fate was not established until ten years later, when their remains were found on Herald Island.<ref>McKinlay, pp. 72<U+2013>76</ref><ref name=N3>Niven, pp. 3<U+2013>6 and 368<U+2013>70</ref>

===March to Wrangel Island===
[[File:Mackay letter Feb1914.jpg|thumb|220px|alt= Worn-looking sheet of paper with two visible folds, covered in small backsloping handwriting, and bearing four signatories.|Letter to Captain Bartlett signed by Alistair Forbes Mackay and his party, informing the captain of their decision to march for land independently]]
Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.<ref>McKinlay, p. 78</ref><ref name= N162>Niven, pp. 162<U+2013>65</ref>

Meanwhile, on 4 February, Mackay and his group (Murray and Beuchat, joined by seaman Stanley Morris) announced they were leaving the next day, to seek land. Mackay presented Bartlett with a letter dated 1 February that began: "We, the undersigned, in consideration of the present critical situation, desire to make an attempt to reach the land." The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities. Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days.<ref>Bartlett, pp. 128<U+2013>29</ref>  They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island. They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load. Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of [[hypothermia]]. However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp.<ref name= N162/> Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe. It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.<ref>Niven, p. 360</ref>
[[File:ArcticIceOffWrangelIsland1914.jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt= Mounds of sea ice clustered together to give an impression of a jagged range of mountains.|The frozen, disturbed surface of the sea around Wrangel Island]]

Bartlett's party now consisted of eight ''Karluk'' crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the family of four and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age,<ref name= B20/> was one of the few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice.<ref name="McKinlay, p. 68"/> Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel.<ref>Leslie, p. 309</ref> When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at {{convert|40|mi|km}}, but the journey proved to be twice that in length.<ref name="McKinlay, p. 81"/>

The ice surface was very broken up, making travel slow and difficult. At first the parties were able to travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties. However, recent storms had destroyed much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept.<ref>Niven, pp. 177<U+2013>78</ref> On 28 February all the parties came together in front of the first of a series of high ridges, from {{convert|25|to|100|ft}} in height, that halted their progress. These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island. McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges. When McKinlay's group returned to the main party a week later, the path forward had been advanced by only three miles (5&nbsp;km), but the worst of the ridges had been overcome.<ref>Leslie, pp. 310<U+2013>11</ref><ref name= M84>McKinlay, pp. 84<U+2013>90</ref> Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience. The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.<ref name= M84/>

==Bartlett's journey==
Bartlett's initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast. However, because three men<U+2014>Mamen, Malloch and Maurer<U+2014>were injured, and others were weak and [[Frostbite|frostbitten]], Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik.<ref>Niven, p. 190</ref> The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs),<ref>Bartlett, p. 180</ref> and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties.<ref>Niven, pp. 196<U+2013>98</ref> After finding nothing, Bartlett and Kataktovik headed towards Siberia, but progress was slow, over ice that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native [[Chukchi people]], and feared for his life. Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward.<ref>Bartlett, pp. 197<U+2013>98</ref>

Five are staring suspiciously at the camera, one is looking away.|A group of North Siberian Chukchi, photographed in 1913]]

On 4 April the pair reached land near Cape Jakan, west of Cape North on the northern Siberian coast. The presence of sledge marks in the snow showed they had landed in an inhabited area.<ref>Niven, pp. 226<U+2013>29</ref> They followed these tracks for a day, before arriving at a small Chukchi village. Here, contrary to Kataktovik's fears, they were received hospitably, and given shelter and food.<ref name= Les315>Leslie, p. 315</ref> On 7 April they set out for [[Cape Dezhnev|East Cape]] and the villages on the Bering coast. Bartlett had not previously experienced such relentlessly cold weather, with blizzards, hurricane force winds, and temperatures often below {{convert|-50|C|0}}. On the way they passed through other Chukchi villages, where Bartlett traded goods for necessary supplies<U+2014>he exchanged his [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt revolver]] for a young, strong dog.<ref>Niven, p. 230</ref> Bartlett was touched by the kindness and generosity shown by many of those they encountered on the way, "typical of the true humanity of these kindly people".<ref name= Les315/>  On 24 April they arrived at Emma Town, a settlement a few miles west of East Cape. Bartlett calculated that in the 37 days since leaving Wrangel Island, he and Kataktovik had travelled about {{convert|700|mi|km|sigfig=2}}, all but the last stage on foot.<ref>Niven, pp. 232<U+2013>34</ref>

At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a distinguished Russian official who offered to take him to [[Providence Bay, Siberia|Emma Harbour]] on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of [[tonsillitis]], said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the Baron.<ref>Niven, pp. 235<U+2013>36 and p. 244</ref> On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler ''Herman'' and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at [[St. Michael, Alaska|St Michael]], where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of ''Karluk's'' fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the [[USS Bear (1874)|''Bear'']], a [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|United States revenue cutter]], which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.<ref>Niven, pp. 255<U+2013>56 and pp. 258<U+2013>59</ref>

==On Wrangel Island==
[[File:Wrangel Mamenmap.jpg|thumb|420px|left|alt= Hand-drawn map from which the island's fish-like shape is evident. Interior geographical features (mountains, rivers) are marked, together will all the named capes and deadlands around the shores.|Tracing of a map of Wrangel Island drawn by Bjarn Mamen. The locations of party's various camping grounds (Icy Spit, Cape Waring, Rodgers Harbor) are indicated.]] 
The landfall from Shipwreck Camp had been on the north side of Wrangel Island, at a spot which they named "Icy Spit". Before his departure, Bartlett asked the  party to set up several camps around the island, which would increase the hunting areas. The captain also felt that separation into smaller groups would assist general harmony by keeping incompatible characters apart.<ref>Niven, p. 192</ref>  He wanted all groups to reassemble at Rodgers Harbor, on the south side of the island, about the middle of July.<ref>McKinlay, p. 94</ref> 

However, dissension broke out almost immediately after Bartlett's departure over the sharing of food. It had not been possible to drag all the supplies from Shipwreck Camp, and the trek had taken longer than expected; consequently there were grave shortages of biscuit, [[pemmican]] (a compound of dried meat, fat and sugar) and dog food on the island. There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June. When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil.<ref name= M96/><ref>McKinlay, pp. 108<U+2013>10</ref> McKinlay records that the circumstances depressed morale and destroyed comradeship: "The misery and desperation of our situation multiplied every weakness, every quirk of personality, every flaw in character, a thousandfold."<ref name= M96/> 

Two attempts were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment.<ref name= M96>McKinlay, pp. 96<U+2013>104</ref> Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools.<ref>McKinlay, p. 105</ref> McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than {{convert|15|mi}}, and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.<ref>Niven, p. 203</ref> 
[[File:RodgersHarbourCampWrangel.jpg|thumb||250px|alt= A conical tent stands on a desolate stretch of beach, with a range of low hills in the background.|The camp at Rodgers Harbor. Wrangel Island]]
Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously. A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy.  Malloch was the worst affected; he died on 17 May, but his tent-mate Mamen was too ill to see to his burial, so the body lay in the tent for several days, creating a "frightful smell", until McKinlay arrived to help. Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.<ref>McKinlay, pp. 113<U+2013>120</ref>

From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds. These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was  remotely edible.<ref>Niven, p. 300 and p. 321</ref> The sharing of birds became another bone of contention; according to Williamson "Wednesday last, [Breddy and Chafe] really obtained 6 eggs and 5 birds instead of 2 eggs and 4 birds as they reported."<ref>Niven, p. 289</ref> Breddy was suspected of other thefts. On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent. The circumstances of his death, whether accident, suicide or in Hadley's view, murder (with Williamson as the chief suspect) could not be determined. Williamson later called Hadley's suspicions "hallucinations and absolutely untrue."<ref name= N357/> Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.<ref>Niven, pp. 287<U+2013>88 and pp. 294<U+2013>95</ref><ref>McKinlay, pp. 135<U+2013>36</ref> 

Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of [[Dominion Day#Canada|Dominion Day]].<ref>Niven, p. 305</ref> Later in the month the party's spirits improved when Kuraluk caught a {{convert|600|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[walrus]], which provided fresh meat for several days.<ref>Niven, pp. 307<U+2013>08</ref> As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the  party began to prepare for another winter.<ref>Niven, pp. 327<U+2013>29</ref>

==Rescue==
[[File:Karluk survivors.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt= Ten men, one woman and two children stand (one man crouching) on a ship's deck. Both children are largely obscured in shadow. The men's clothes look haphazard, and the facial expressions of most are sombre and weary, although a few are attempting to smile.|The ''Karluk'' survivors after rescue, photographed with Captain Bartlett on board the rescue vessel ''Bear'']]
The revenue cutter ''Bear'' arrived in St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, agreed to go to Wrangel Island as soon as he got permission from the United States government.<ref>Niven, pp. 264<U+2013>65</ref> It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were  reported as severe.<ref>Bartlett, p. 297</ref> After receiving permission ''Bear'', with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July, but had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could attempt the rescue.<ref>Niven, pp. 302<U+2013>03</ref> On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing.<ref>Bartlett, p. 301</ref> At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving ''Karluk'' the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.<ref>Bartlett, pp. 302<U+2013>306</ref>

McConnell left Point Barrow for Nome aboard ''King and Winge'', an American-registered walrus hunter, while ''Bear'' finally sailed for Wrangel Island.<ref name= McC/><ref name= Cochran/><ref>Niven, pp. 324<U+2013>27</ref> On 25 August ''Bear'' was stopped by ice {{convert|20|mi}} from the island, and after failing to force a way through, Cochran had to return to Nome for more coal<U+2014>a decision which, says Bartlett, gave him "days to try a man's soul".<ref>Bartlett, p. 309</ref> In Nome Bartlett met [[Olaf Swenson]] who had chartered  ''King and Winge'' for the season and was about to sail for Siberia. Bartlett requested that, if possible, ''King and Winge'' stop by Wrangel Island and look for the stranded ''Karluk'' party.  ''Bear'' left Nome on 4 September, a few days after Swenson's ship.<ref>Niven, pp. 333<U+2013>334</ref> ''King and Winge'', with McConnell still aboard, reached Wrangel Island on 7 September. That morning the group at Rodgers Harbor were awakened early in the morning by the sound of a ship's whistle,  and found  ''King and Winge'' lying a quarter of a mile offshore. They were rapidly transferred to the ship, which then picked up the remainder of the stranded party who were camped along the coast at Cape Waring. By the afternoon all 14 survivors were aboard.<ref>McKinlay, pp. 148<U+2013>51</ref><ref name= McC/><ref name= Cochran/>

==Aftermath==
Bartlett, celebrated as a hero by press and public, was honoured for "outstanding bravery" by the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. However, he was later censured by an admiralty commission for taking ''Karluk'' into the ice, and for allowing Mackay's party to leave the main group<U+2014>despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility.<ref name= Higgins/><ref name= N357/> Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett's conduct.<ref>Henighan, p. 62</ref> Bartlett  resumed his career at sea, and over the next 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic.<ref name= N357>Niven, pp. 357<U+2013>67</ref> During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 71, in April 1946.<ref>Leslie, pp. 320<U+2013>21</ref> His account of the ''Karluk'' disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader.<ref name= N357/> 
[[File:Mukpie-Karluk-survivor.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=A small child standing on what appears to be a ship's deck. She is wearing a fur-trimmed smock and fur boots, and has an open, happy expression.|"Mugpi", the three-year-old child who with her family survived the ordeal of the ''Karluk'' voyage.]]
In 1918 Stefansson returned after four years' absence, reporting the discovery of three new islands. He was honoured by the National Geographical Society, received tributes from polar veterans such as Peary and [[Adolphus Greely]],<ref name= McK162>McKinlay, p. 162</ref> and was given the presidency of the [[Explorers Club]] of New York.<ref>Henigahan, p. 68</ref> In Canada his reception was more muted; there were questions relating to the overall costs of the expedition,<ref name= N357/> its poor initial organisation, and his handling of the Southern Party which, under Rudolph Anderson, completed its work independently of Stefansson.<ref>Henighan, pp. 69<U+2013>74</ref> Anderson and other members of the Southern Party later petitioned the Canadian government to investigate statements made by Stefansson in his 1921 book  ''The Friendly Arctic'', which they felt reflected poorly on their honour. The request was declined on the ground that "no good could come of the enquiry."<ref name= N357/> In his book Stefansson takes responsibility for the "bold" decision to take ''Karluk'' into the ice rather than hugging the coast on the way to Herschel Island, and accepts that he "chose the wrong alternative".<ref>Stefansson, p.48</ref> However, McKinlay felt that the book gave an inaccurate account of the ''Karluk'' voyage and its consequences, "putting the blame ... on everyone but Vilhjalmur Stefansson."<ref name= McK162/> Historian Tom Henighan believes that McKinlay's biggest complaint against his leader was that "Stefansson never at any time seemed able to express an appropriate sorrow over his lost men."<ref>Henighan, p. 76</ref> Stefansson, who never returned to the Arctic, died in 1962 at the age of 82.<ref name= Leslie>Leslie, pp. 321<U+2013>22</ref>

The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party remained unknown until 1924, when an American vessel landed at Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment. From these artefacts it was established that this was Anderson's party. No cause of death was established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation. One theory was that the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death. Another was [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] within the tent.<ref name= N3/>

The mystery illness which affected most of the Wrangel Island party and accelerated the deaths of Malloch and Mamen was later diagnosed as a form of [[nephritis]] brought about by eating faulty pemmican. Stefansson explained this by saying that "our pemmican makers has failed us through supplying us with a product deficient in fat."<ref>Stefansson, p. 486</ref> Peary had emphasised that a polar explorer should "give his personal, constant and insistent attention" to the making of his pemmican; McKinlay believed that Stefansson had devoted too much time selling the idea of the expedition, and too little ensuring the quality of the food that its members would depend upon.<ref>Leslie, pp. 317<U+2013>18</ref> 

Of the survivors, Hadley continued working for the Canadian Arctic Expedition, becoming second officer and later master of the supply ship ''Polar Bear''. He died of influenza, in San Francisco in 1918.<ref>Stefansson, p. 763</ref> Hadley and McConnell wrote accounts of their experiences for Stefansson, who incorporated them in ''The Friendly Arctic''.  Chafe also wrote and published a short account.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chafe |first=Ernest F.|title=The Voyage of the "Karluk," and Its Tragic Ending |journal=The Geographical Journal |volume=51 |year=1918|month=May |pages=307<U+2013>316 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1780073}}</ref>  Most of the others quickly returned to relative obscurity, but in 1922 Fred Maurer was persuaded by Stefansson to join an attempt to colonise Wrangel Island. To the embarrassment of the Canadian government,<ref>Diubaldo, p. 161</ref> Stefansson insisted on going ahead, even though Wrangel Island was indisputably part of what had then become the Soviet Union. A party of five, including Maurer, was sent to the island; only one, an Inuit woman, survived.<ref name= Leslie/> Despite their  ordeal, many of the ''Karluk'' survivors lived long lives; Williamson, who declined to speak or write of his experiences in the Arctic, lived to be 97, dying in Victoria, Canada, in 1975.  McKinlay died in 1983, aged 95, having published his account of the expedition in 1976.<ref name= N357/> Kuraluk, Kuruk and their daughters, Helen and Mugpi, returned to their former life at Point Barrow. The two girls, says P<U+00E1>lsson, had provided "important sources of cheer at the darkest moments."<ref>P<U+00E1>lsson, p. 136</ref> Mugpi, who later was known as Ruth Makpii Ipalook, became the very last survivor of the ''Karluk'' voyage, dying in 2008 after a full life, aged 97.<ref>{{cite news|last= Harper|first= Kenn|url= http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/archives/2008/807/80725/opinionEditorial/columns.html|title= Ruth Makpii Ipalook: 1911<U+2013>2008|newspaper= Nunatsiaq News|date= 18 July 2008|accessdate= 5 February 2010}}</ref>

==Published voyage accounts==
Six first-hand accounts of ''Karluk's'' last voyage have been published. These include Stefansson's account which only covers the June to September 1913 period. Expedition secretary Burt McConnell wrote an account of the Wrangel Island rescue which was published in ''The New York Times'', 15 September 1914. A version of McConnell's account appears in Stefansson's book.
