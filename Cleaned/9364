olta pennant number OB-02 is a Mirna-class patrol boat Mirna-class patrol boat in service with the Croatian Navy. Completed during the 1980s as P-176 Mukos, it was the sixth ship of a class that was being built for the Yugoslav Navy in the Kraljevica Shipyard.
During the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of a tactical group tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the city of Split, Croatia Split. On 14 November, Croatian Navy commandos disabled it with an improvised torpedo, leaving the vessel drifting and abandoned by its crew. The crippled ship was then tugged away by Croatian locals to the nearby island of olta. It was subsequently repaired and entered service with the Croatian Navy as olta. As of 2014, it remains in service with the Croatian Coast Guard, an integral part of the Navy.
 Design and construction 
Main Mirna-class patrol boat

Powered by two SEMT Pielstick 12PA4 200VGDS diesel engines that spin two propellers, olta has a maximum speed of convert 29.5 - 30 kn and a continuous speed of convert 28 kn. It has a range of convert 600 nmi at convert 15 kn and an autonomy of four to five days that can be extended to eight days during wartime.sfn Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirnasfn Wertheim 2007 p=146sfn Alan Agency
The ship's original armament consisted of a single Bofors 40 mm gun Bofors 40 mm D70 gun mounted on the ship's bow, a quadruple Strela 2 launcher behind the bridge and a quad 20&nbsp;mm M-75 gun on the stern. Eight MDB-MT3 depth charges could be carried for anti-submarine warfare duties.sfn Wertheim 2007 p=146 Located on the sides were two double-barrel 128&nbsp;mm battlefield illumination illumination launchers.sfn Saunders 2004 p=163sfn Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirna Sensors included a Decca Radar Racal Decca RM 1216 A surface search radar and a Simrad Yachting Simrad SQ 3D/SF sonar.sfn Brodarski institut - Fast Patrol Craft Mirna
 Service 
During its service in the Yugoslav Navy, Mukos was part of the border patrol detachment.sfn Gardiner 1995 p=648sfn vel 13 August 2012 In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of the Katela tactical group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of Split, Croatia Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Bra and olta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy HRM, effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to sink and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a Shershen-class torpedo boat Shershen-class torpedo boat Pionir II T-224 while Mukos itself was left adrift.sfn Bernardi 15 November 2004sfn Dadi 16 November 2013

During the night of 15 November the ship was tugged away by a Croatian fishing ship to the nearby Neujam cove, where it was beached to prevent it from sinking. In the early hours of the same day, the remaining JRM ships opened fire in retaliation for damaging Mukos. As Yugoslav forces left the area, the ship was towed to an overhauling shipyard in ibenik on the night of 17/18 November, after being salvaged by HRM divers with the help of Brodospas.sfn Bernardi 15 November 2004sfn Dadi 16 November 2013sfn OSRH The ship was repaired and renamed olta, entering service with the HRM on 15 May 1992 with Mile Tomas in command.sfn OSRH
The Croatian Coast Guard was formed in October 2007, and olta was assigned to the 1st Division, based in Split.sfn Urli May 2010 During the same year the ship underwent a modernisation that included the installation of a new Sperry Marine surface search radar, gyrocompass and GPS.sfn Godinje izvjee  A second refit that occurred sometime between 2007 and 2013 included the deletion of the Strela launcher and the stern 20&nbsp;mm M-75 gun to create space needed for a RHIB and a hydraulic crane used to lower it into the sea. The pennant number was changed from OB-62 to OB-02.sfn Vlahovi April 2013
