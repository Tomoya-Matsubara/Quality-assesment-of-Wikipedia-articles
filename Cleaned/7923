Design and description
The Maya vessels were Japans first iron-hulled gunboats, although only ship Japanese gunboat Maya  2 and ship Japanese gunboat Chkai  2 had true iron hulls. ship Japanese gunboat Atago  2 had a composite hull construction, whereas ship Japanese gunboat Akagi  2 has a steel hull. All four vessels had auxiliary Schooner schooner-rigged sails.
The Maya-class ships had an length overall overall length of convert 47.0 m ft 1, a Beam nautical beam of convert 8.2 m ft 1, and a normal Draft hull draught of convert 2.95 m ft 1. They displaced convert 614 LT t lk=in at normal load.Chesneau,  All the Worlds Fighting Ships, p. 236. The crew numbered about 104 officers and enlisted men.
Propulsion was by a coal-fired horizontal double-expansion reciprocating steam engine with two cylindrical boiler steam generator boilers driving a double screw. The engines were rated at convert 614 ihp lk=in, and designed to reach a top speed of convert 10.25 kn.
The Maya-class ships were initially intended to be armed with one Krupp convert 210 mm in 0 abbr=on Krupp L/22 breech-loading gun, and one Krupp convert 120 mm in abbr=on L/22 breech-loading gun, with two quadruple 1-inch Nordenfelt guns as secondary armament. However, each ship later modified to carry different armament in 1906.
Two of the three vessels Maya and Akagi were built by the private-contractor, Onohama Shipyards in Kobe a predecessor of Hitachi Zosen Corporation, and one Chkai  was by built by the private-contractor IHI Ishikawajima-Hirano Shipyards. Atago was built by the governments Yokosuka Naval Arsenal
All four ships served in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. In 1898, the ships were reclassified as second-class gunboats. Atago was lost in combat during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Maya and Chkai were removed from the navy list in 1908 and were subsequently broken up in 1913. Akagi was removed from the navy list in 1911,Nishida,  Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy  but survived under civilian ownership until 1953.
