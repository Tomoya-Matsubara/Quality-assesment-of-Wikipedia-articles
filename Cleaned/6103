Background
In September 2012, Minaj announced the reissue of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, containing an additional disc with eight newly-recording songs and an exclusive behind-the-scenes DVD to supplement the standard edition of the original album.23 Minaj commented at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, &quot;I'm putting lots of new songs on there and I'm actually going to drop my new single like next week. Barbz, you are gonna spaz. You are gonna love it. You are gonna go crazy!&quot;4 Production of the project was a main focus on Minaj's three-part E! special, Nicki Minaj: My Truth, which aired in November 2012.5 On On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Minaj stated that &quot;I feel like the music is such a better representation of me where I am now as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good.&quot;6
Composition and critical reception
Musically, &quot;Freedom&quot; is a hip hop and R&amp;B song that follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday.789 The song features minimal production;10 merging street-slang bravado and &quot;venomous&quot; rapping in the verses with thin, fragile vocals over whipsy soft pop choruses.111213 The instrumentation in &quot;Freedom&quot; mixes together smooth ambient riffs,14 pop-inspired crystal-clear synthesizers,15 and a smooth R&amp;B beat,16 creating a sonically breezy soundscape.17 Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, talking about her life in the spotlight and rise to fame.18 In the lyrics, Minaj states how other rappers &quot;in the competition&quot; will never thank her for opening the doors for them, and how they don't even thank their creator Jesus Christ for helping them get far, saying: &quot;They'll never thank me for opening doors / But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / 'Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple.&quot;19
Charley Rogulewski of Vibe said &quot;The old Nicki Minaj is back on her latest track &quot;Freedom.&quot;&quot;, while going onto note the songs &quot;dreamy&quot; production and compared it to &quot;Right Thru Me,&quot; &quot;Your Love&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot; off her debut album.20 Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kyle Anderson called the song &quot;middle-of-the-road R&amp;B&quot; and criticized Minaj for choosing to make music that appeals to pop radio, instead of being unique.21 Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! was critical of the song, saying it was: &quot;by-the-books Nicki, as she delivers venomous raps on the verses before giving saccharine-sweet melody a whirl on the choruses. Surprise, surprise &lt;U+2014&gt; the whole thing is delivered atop poppy, crystal clear synths.&quot;22 Popcrush reviewer Jessica Sagger felt the song was a potential hit, noting both its pop and hip-hop appeal, while also comparing it to another Minaj song, &quot;Young Forever&quot;.23
Music video
 The video was shot in black-and-white. It begins with a stairway set in a foggy setting leading up to the sky. Then angles of different scenery are shown such as a deserted area with a boat next to railroad resembling Noah's Ark, railroad pathaway, and a True Cross with a key hung over it. Minaj is shown fading into clouds, before she raps her first verse wearing a black flowing dress and a crown of thorns. Minaj has various wardrobe changes in the video. Minaj is then seen dressed as a queen, over a balcony with a spiral chandelier behind her. Various clips of nature are shown such as waves, birds, and grass. Minaj is then seen singing the chorus in a blonde wig, in a vast space, with a lot of fog. Minaj raps her second verse sitting on a throne donning a black wig similar to the on she wore in her previous music video for &quot;I Am Your Leader&quot;. After scenes of nature and of Minaj, the video transforms into color. The video concludes as Minaj is seen with a stray-like face, walking in the wilderness, while clips of Minaj singing continue throughout the video. It closes with the stairway, seen in the beginning of the video. Tom Eames of Digital Spy complimented the video for its &quot;glamorous&quot; shots of Minaj,24 a sentiment echoed by Liza Darwin of MTV News, who said: &quot;We already know Nicki's got her beauty and fashion game on lock these days, but for her new vid the singer ditches the bustiers, tutus, and Zenon-inspired ensembles for a toned-down (for her, at least) wardrobe of glittery gowns, decadent furs, and more than one crown. After all, if there's ANYONE fit to be queen bee, it's this lady.&quot;25
Live performances
