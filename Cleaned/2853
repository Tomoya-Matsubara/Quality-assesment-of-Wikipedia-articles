 Orion (Greek  or , Latin Orion)1 in Greek mythology, was a great huntsman who was placed among the stars as the constellation of Orion. He is described as a great hunter in the ancient Greek epic, the Odyssey, when Ulysses meets him in the underworld. The bare bones of his story are told by the Hellenistic and Roman collectors of myths, but there is no record of him comparable to that of other Greek heroes, such as Jason in the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes or in Euripides' Medea. The remaining fragments of legend have provided a fertile field for speculation about the prehistory of Greek myth.
Ancient sources tell several different stories about Orion. There are two major versions of his birth and three or four major versions of his death. The major recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to Chios where he met Merope and was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the blow of Artemis or of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.
Orion served several roles in ancient Greek culture. The story of the adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the most supported (and that not very well). He is also the personification of the constellation Orion. In addition, he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Straits of Sicily.
Legends
Homer and Hesiod
Orion is mentioned in the oldest surviving works of Greek literature, which probably date back to the seventh or eighth century BC. In Homer's Iliad, Orion is described as a constellation; and the star Sirius is mentioned as his dog.2 In the Odyssey, Ulysses sees him hunting in the underworld with a bronze club, a great slayer of animals; he is also mentioned as a constellation as the lover of the Goddess Dawn—slain by Artemis—and as the most handsome of the earthborn.3 In the Works and Days of Hesiod, Orion is also a constellation, one whose rising and setting with the sun is used to reckon the year.4  The legend of Orion was first told in full in Hesiod's Astronomy. This no longer exists, but a Hellenistic writer on the constellations has given a fairly long summary.5 According to this version, Orion was the son of the sea-god Poseidon and Euryale, daughter of Minos, King of Crete. Orion could walk on the waves and went to the island of Chios where he got drunk and attacked Merope, daughter of Oenopion, the ruler there. Oenopion blinded him and drove him away. He then went to Lemnos where Hephaestus, the lame smith-god, had his forge. Hephaestus told his servent, Cedalion, to guide Orion to the uttermost East where Helios, the Sun, healed him. Then Orion carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. Orion returned to Chios to punish Oenopion but instead he hid away underground. Orion next went to Crete and hunted with the goddess Artemis and Leto, her mother, and threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Earth objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill him instead. After his death, the goddesses asked Zeus to place Orion among the constellations and he consented, adding the Scorpion as a memorial.6
Other sources
Although Orion is referred to in Homer and Hesiod, most of the stories about him are recorded in incidental allusions and in fairly obscure later writings. No great poet standardized the legend.7 The ancient sources for Orion's legend are mostly notes in the margins of ancient poets (scholia) or compilations by later scholars, the equivalent of modern reference works or encyclopedias. Even the legend from Hesiod's Astronomy survives only in one such compilation. In several cases, although the surviving work bears the name of a famous scholar, such as Apollodorus of Athens, Eratosthenes, or Gaius Julius Hyginus, what survives is often an ancient forgery or an abridgement of the original compilation by a later writer of dubious competence.8 The margin of the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note summarizing a Hellenistic poet9 who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasted a whole bull for them.10 When they offered him a favor, he asked for the birth of sons. The gods took the bull's hide and ejaculated, or urinated, into it11 and buried it in the earth, then told him to dig it up ten months12 later. When he did, he found Orion. This explains why Orion is earthborn.13
A second full telling (even shorter than the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era collection of myths based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here Orion is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. (This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents.) It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, fell in love with Orion and took him to Delos and Artemis slew him there.14
Another narrative, three paragraphs, is by a Latin writer on the constellations whose brief notes have come down to us under the name of Hyginus.15 It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios.16 Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon;17 one modern critic suggests this is the original version.18 This source tells two stories of the death of Orion. The first says that because of his &quot;living joined in too great a friendship&quot; with Oenopion he boasted to Artemis and Leto that he could kill anything which came from Earth. Earth objected and created the Scorpion.19 In the second story, Apollo objected to Artemis's love for Orion, and (seeing Orion swimming with just his head visible) challenged his sister to shoot at that mark, which she hit and killed him.20 The same source connects Orion with several constellations, not just Scorpio. Orion chased Pleione, the mother of the Pleiades, for seven years, until Zeus intervened and raised all of them to the stars.21 In the Works and Days, Orion chases the Pleiades themselves. Canis Minor and Canis Major are his dogs, the one in front is called Procyon. They chase Lepus, the hare, although Hyginus says some critics thought this too base a prey for the noble Orion and have him pursuing Taurus instead.22 A Renaissance mythographer adds other names for Orion's dogs: Leucomelaena, Maera, Dromis, Cisseta, Lampuris, Lycoctonus, Ptoophagus, Arctophonus.23
Variants
There are numerous variants in other authors. Most of these are incidental references in poems and scholiasts. The Roman poet Vergil shows Orion as a giant wading through the Aegean Sea rather than walking on the top of it.24 There are several references to Hyrieus as the father of Orion that connect him to various places in Boeotia, including Hyria; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the eponym of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus although he is not the Calydonian Oeneus.25 Other ancient scholia say, like Hesiod, that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles.26 There are two versions of how Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the discus. Another is he assaulted either Artemis or the Hyperborean maiden Opis in her band of huntresses.27 Aratus's brief description, in his Astronomy, conflates the elements of the myth. According to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on Chios, and the Scorpion kills him there.28 Nicander, in his Theriaca, has the scorpion of ordinary size, hiding under a small (oligos) stone.29 Most versions of the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here there is a variant: Ancient poets differed greatly as to who Aesculapius brought back from the dead;30 the Argive epic poet Telesarchus is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion.31 Other ancient authorities are quoted anonymously that Aesculapius healed Orion after he was blinded by Oenopion.32
The story of Orion and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as the wife of Oenopion and not his daughter. Another refers to Merope as the daughter of Minos and not of Oenopion.33 The longest version (a page in the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman Cornelius Gallus to make into Latin verse.34 It describes Orion as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter who is called A&lt;U+00EB&gt;ro or Leiro.35 Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like Orion, and eventually Orion, in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.
 Lucian includes a picture with Orion in a rhetorical description of an ideal building in which Orion is walking into the rising sun with Lemnos, Cedalion on his shoulder, nearby. He recovers his sight there with Hephaestus still watching in the background.36
''The next picture deals with the ancient story of Orion. He is blind, and on his shoulder carries Cedalion, who directs the sightless eyes towards the East. The rising Sun heals his infirmity; and there stands Hephaestus on Lemnos, watching the cure.37
Latin sources add that Oenopion was the son of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but converts Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos &lt;U+2014&gt; this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources.38 One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse. 39
Giovanni Boccaccio quotes a lost Latin writer for the story that Orion and Candiope were son and daughter of Oenopion, king of Sicily. While the virgin huntsman Orion was sleeping in a cave, Venus seduced him; as he left the cave, he saw his sister shining as she crossed in front of it. He ravished her; when his father heard of this, he banished Orion. Orion consulted an oracle, which told him that if he went east, he would regain the glory of kingship. Orion, Candiope, and their son Hippologus sailed to Thrace, &quot;a province eastward from Sicily&quot;. There he conquered the inhabitants, and became known as the son of Neptune. His son begat the Dryas mentioned in Statius.40
Cult and popular appreciation
In Ancient Greece, Orion had a hero cult in the region of Boeotia. The number of places associated with his birth suggest that it was widespread.41 Hyria, the most frequently mentioned, was in the territory of Tanagra. A feast of Orion was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire.42 They had a tomb of Orion 43 most likely at the foot of Mount Cerycius (now Mount Tanagra). 44 Maurice Bowra argues that Orion was a national hero of the Boeotians, as was Castor and Pollux to the Dorians. 45 He bases this claim on the Athenian epigram on the Battle of Coronea in which a hero gave the Boeotian army an oracle, then fought on their side and defeated the Athenians.
The Boeotian school of epic poetry was chiefly concerned with the genealogies of the gods and heroes; 1ater writers elaborated this web.46 Several other myths are attached to Orion in this way: A papyrus fragment of the Boeotian poet Corinna gives Orion fifty sons (a traditional number). This included the oracular hero Acraephen, who, she sings, gave a response to Asopus regarding Asopus' daughters who were abducted by the gods. Corinna sang of Orion conquering and naming all the land of the dawn.47 Maurice Bowra argues that Orion delivered oracles as well, probably at a different shrine.Bowra, loc. cit., p. 84&lt;U+2013&gt;85; Review of Griechische Dichterfragmente (ed. Schubart, Wilamowitz, Buecheler; 1907)
by J. U. Powell  The Classical Review, Vol. 22, No. 6. (Sep., 1908), pp. 175&lt;U+2013&gt;178.   Hyginus says that  Hylas's mother was Menodice, daughter of Orion.48   Another mythographer, Liberalis, tells of  Menippe and Metioche, daughters of Orion, who sacrificed themselves for their country's good and were transformed into comets.49 
 Orion also has etiological connection to the city of Messina in Sicily. Diodorus of Sicily wrote a history of the world up to his own time (the beginning of the reign of Augustus). He starts with the gods and the heroes. At the end he tells the story of Orion and the two wonder-stories of his mighty earth-works in Sicily. One tells how he aided Zanclus, the founder of Zancle (the former name for Messina), by building the promontory which forms the harbor.50The other, which Diodorus ascribes to Hesiod, relates that there was once a broad sea between Sicily and the mainland. Orion built the whole Peloris, the Punta del Faro, and the temple to Poseidon at the tip, after which he settled in Euboea. He was then &quot;numbered among the stars of heaven and thus won for himself immortal remembrance&quot;. 51 The Renaissance historian and mathematician who came from Messina, Francesco Maurolico, identified the remains of a temple of Orion near the present Messina Cathedral,52 and Orion is still a popular symbol of the city.
Appeciation of Orion in classical art is difficult to distinguish, and clear examples are rare. There are several ancient Greek images of club-carrying hunters that could represent Orion,53 but such generic examples could equally represent an archetypal &quot;hunter&quot;, or indeed Heracles.54 Some other claims have been made for Greek art that represents specific aspects of the Orion myth. A tradition of this type has been discerned in 5th century BC Greek pottery&lt;U+2014&gt;John Beazley identified a scene of Apollo, Delian palm in hand, revenging Orion for the attempted rape of Artemis, while another scholar has identified a a scene of Orion attacking Artemis as she is revenged by a snake (a counterpart to the scorpion) in a funerary group&lt;U+2014&gt;supposedly symbolizing the hope that even the criminal Orion could be made immortal, as well as an astronomical scene in which Cephalus is thought to stand in for Orion and his constellation, also reflecting this system of iconography.55 Also, a tomb frieze in Taranto (ca. 300 BC) may show Orion attacking Opis.56 But the earliest surviving clear depiction of Orion in classical art is Roman, from the depictions of the Underworld scenes of the Odyssey discovered at the Esquiline Hill (50&lt;U+2013&gt;40 BC). Orion is also seen on a 4th century bas-relief,57 currently affixed to a wall in the Porto neighborhood of Naples (The constellation Orion rises in November, the end of the sailing season, and was associated with stormy weather,58 and this characterization extended to the mythical Orion&lt;U+2014&gt;the bas-relief may be associated with the sailors of the city.).
Interpretations
Renaissance
 Mythographers have discussed Orion at least since the Renaissance of classical learning. Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death at the hands of the moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms.59 The 16th-century Italian mythographer Natalis Comes interpreted the whole story of Orion as an allegory of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from &lt;U+03C7&gt;&lt;U+03AD&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;, &quot;pour out&quot;), rises though the upper air (A&lt;U+00EB&gt;rope, as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: &quot;Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water.&quot;60 Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the philosophical child, an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist Michael Maier lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury,61 and the 18th-century French alchemist Antoine-Joseph Pernety gave them as Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury.62
Modern
Modern mythographers have seen the story of Orion as a way to access local folk tales and cultic practices directly without the interference of ancient high culture;63 several of them have explained Orion through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory, and how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them; for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.64
There was a movement in the late nineteenth century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations.65 There has come to be wide agreement since that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confused the two.66 Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of mythical astronomy. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky.67 Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent thither.68 The 19th-century German classical scholar Erwin Rohde viewed Orion as an example of the Greeks erasing the line between the gods and mankind. That is, if Orion was in the heavens, other mortals could hope to be also.69
The Hungarian mythographer Karl Ker&lt;U+00E9&gt;nyi, one of the founders of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in Gods of the Greeks (1951). Ker&lt;U+00E9&gt;nyi portrays Orion as a giant of Titanic vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were Tityos or Dionysus.70 Ker&lt;U+00E9&gt;nyi places great stress on the variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his stepmother and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of Aegypius and Oedipus. Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as the type specimen of a variety of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to C&lt;U+00FA&gt;chulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress. Orion has also been identified with Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in the figures of Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).
In Dionysus (1976), Ker&lt;U+00E9&gt;nyi portrays Orion as a shamanic hunting hero, surviving from Minoan times (hence his association with Crete). Ker&lt;U+00E9&gt;nyi derives Hyrieus (and Hyria) from the Cretan dialect word hyron, which survives only in ancient dictionaries. It means &quot;beehive&quot;. From this association he turns Orion into a representative of the old mead-drinking cultures, overcome by the wine masters Oenopion and Oeneus. (The Greek for &quot;wine&quot; is oinos.) Fontenrose cites a source stating that Oenopion taught the Chians how to make wine before anybody else knew how.71
In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his perennial Year-King, at the stage where the king pretends to die at the end of his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Ulysses blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. He compares Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.72
Cultural references
 The ancient Greek and Roman sources which tell more about Orion than his being a gigantic huntsman are mostly both dry and obscure. The brief passages in Aratus and Vergil are mentioned above. Pindar celebrates the pancratist Melissus of Thebes &quot;who was not granted the build of an Orion&quot;, but whose strength was heavy anyway.73 Cicero translated Aratus in his youth; he made the Orion episode half again longer than it was in the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.74 Orion is used by Horace, who tells of his death at the hands of Diana/Artemis,75 and by Ovid, in his Fasti for May 11, the middle day of the Lemuria, when (in Ovid's time) Orion set with the sun.76 This is the story of Hyrieus and the three gods, but Ovid is bashful about the climax; Ovid makes Hyrieus a poor man, to make the sacrifice of an entire ox more generous. There is also a single mention in his Art of Love, as a sufferer from unrequited love: &quot;Pale Orion wandered in the forest for Side.&quot;77 Statius mentions Orion four times in his Thebiad; twice as the constellation, a personification of storm, but twice as the ancestor of Dryas of Tanagra, one of the defenders of Thebes.78
References since antiquity are fairly rare. At the beginning of the 17th century, the French sculptor Barth&lt;U+00E9&gt;lemy Prieur cast a bronze statue Orion et C&lt;U+00E9&gt;dalion, some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured Orion with Cedalion on his shoulder, in a depiction of the ancient legend of Orion recovering his sight.79 The French artist Nicolas Poussin painted Paysage avec Orion aveugle cherchant le soleil (1658) (lit: &quot;Landscape with blind Orion seeking the sun&quot;), after learning of a description by the 2nd-century Greek author Lucian, of a picture of Orion recovering his sight. In the painting, he combined this description with Natalis Comes's 16th century interpretation of the same scene.80 The Austrian artist Daniel Seiter (active in Turin, Italy), painted Diane aupr&lt;U+00E8&gt;s du cadavre d'Orion (c.1685) (lit: &quot;Diana next to the corpse of Orion&quot;), pictured above.
The English poet John Keats wrote Endymion (1818), which includes the line &quot;Or blind Orion hungry for the morn&quot;, thought to be inspired by Poussin. William Hazlitt may have introduced Keats to the painting—he later wrote the essay &quot;On Landscape of Nicholas Poussin&quot;, published in Table Talk, Essays on Men and Manners (1822).81 Richard Henry Horne, writing in the generation after Keats and Hazlitt, penned the three volume epic poem Orion in 1843. It went into at least ten editions and was reprinted by the Scholartis Press in 1928.82
The Italian composer Francesco Cavalli wrote the opera, &quot;L'Orione&quot;, in 1653. The story is set on the Greek island of Delos and focuses on Diana's love for Orion as well as on her rival, Aurora. Diana shoots Orion only after being tricked by Apollo into thinking him a sea monster—she then laments his death and searches for Orion in the underworld until he is elevated to the heavens.83 The German composer Johann Christian Bach ('the English Bach') wrote an opera, &quot;Orion, or Diana Reveng&lt;U+2019&gt;d&quot;, first presented at London's Haymarket Theatre in 1763. Orion, sung by a castrato, is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow. In another aria, his mother, Retrea (Queen of Thebes), laments his death but ultimately sees his elevation to the heavens.84 The 2002 opera, Galileo Galilei, by the American composer Philip Glass, includes an opera within an opera piece between Orion and Merope. The sunlight, which heals Orion's blindness, is an allegory of modern science.85 Philip Glass has also written a shorter work on Orion, as have T&lt;U+014D&gt;ru Takemitsu,86 Kaija Saariaho,87 and John Casken.88 David Bedford's late-twentieth-century works are about the constellation rather than the mythical figure as he is an amateur astronomer.89
The twentieth-century French poet Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Char found the blind, lustful huntsman, both pursuer and pursued, a central symbol as James Lawler has explained at some length in his 1978 work Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Char: the Myth and the Poem.90 French novelist Claude Simon likewise found Orion an apt symbol, in this case of the writer, as he explained in his Orion aveugle of 1970. Marion Perret argues that Orion is a silent link in T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922), connecting the lustful Actaeon/Sweeney to the blind Teiresias and, through Sirius, to the Dog &quot;that's friend to men&quot;.91

Eratosthenes, Catasterismi; translation in  Whether these works are actually by Hesiod and Eratosthenes themselves is doubtful.↩
Scorpion is the type of creature, Greek &lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;, not a proper name. The constellation is called Scorpius in astronomy; colloquially, Scorpio, like the related astrological sign &lt;U+2014&gt; both are Latin forms of the Greek word. Cicero used Nepa, the older Latin word for scorpion.↩

OCD. Under &quot;Apollodorus of Athens (6)&quot; it describes the Bibliotheca as an uncritical forgery some centuries later than Apollodorus; it distinguishes &quot;Hyginus (4)&quot;, the author of the Fabulae and Astronomy, from &quot;Hyginus (1)&quot;, (C. Julius) adding of the former that the &quot;absurdities&quot; of this &quot;abbreviated&quot; compilation are &quot;partly due to its compiler's ignorance of Greek.&quot; Under &quot;Eratosthenes&quot;, it dismisses the surviving Catasterismi as pseudo-Eratosthenic. Editors of these texts suggest that they may have borne the names of great scholars because they were abridgments, or even pupil's notes, based on them. See Frazer's Loeb Apollodorus, and Condos's translation of the other two (as Star myths of the Greeks and Romans Phanes, 1997, ISBN 1890482927↩

The ancient sources for this story all phrase it so that this could be either a bull or a cow; translations vary, although &quot;bull&quot; may be more common. A bull would be an appropriate sacrifice to male gods.↩
Both are represented by the same Greek participle, ourion, thus explaining Orion's name. The Latin translations by Hyginus are ambiguous. Ejaculation of semen is the more obvious interpretation here, and Kerenyi assumes it; but John Peter Oleson argued, in the note to p.28 of A Possible Physiological Basis for the Term urinator, &quot;diver&quot; (The American Journal of Philology, Vol. 97, No. 1. (Spring, 1976), pp. 22-29) that urination is intended here; Robert Graves compares this to a African raincharm including urination, as mentioned below.↩

Both are emendations of Parthenius's text, which is Haero; A&lt;U+00EB&gt;ro is from Gaselee's Loeb editon; Leiro &quot;lily&quot; Is from J. L. Lightfoot's 1999 edition of Parthenius, p.495, which records the several emendations suggested by other editors, which include Maero and Merope. &quot;Leiro&quot; is supported by a Hellenistic inscription from Chios, which mentions a Liro as a companion of Oenopion.↩
Lucian, De domo 28; Poussin followed this description, and A. B. Cook interprets all the mentions of Orion being healed by the Sun in this sense. Zeus I, 290 n. 3 Fontenrose sees a combination of two stories: the lands of Dawn in the far east; and Hephaestus' smithy, the source of fire.↩

Despite its differences from the other summary of Hesiod on Orion, Alois Rzach grouped this as a fragment of the Astronomy (Oldfather's note).↩

Carmina 3.4.70. The Roman goddess Diana was identified very early with Artemis, and her name was conventionally used to translate Artemis into Latin by Horace's time.

So also Jupiter=Zeus; Neptune= Poseidon, and so forth. See Interpretatio Romana.↩
