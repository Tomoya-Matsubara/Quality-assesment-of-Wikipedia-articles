The Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) is a subspecies of Western honey bee. It originates from Slovenia, but can now be found also in Austria, part of Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia.
Origin
The bee is the subspecies of the Western honey bee that has naturalized and adapted to the Carniola Ko&lt;U+010D&gt;evje (Gottschee) region of Slovenia, the Southern part of the Austrian Alps and North Balkans. These bees are known as Carniolans, or short Carnies, in English. At present this race (i.e., subspecies) is the second most popular among beekeepers (after the Italian honey bees). It is favored among beekeepers for several reasons, not the least being its ability to defend itself successfully against insect pests while at the same time being extremely gentle in its behavior toward beekeepers. These bees are particularly adept at adjusting worker population to nectar availability. It relies on these rapid adjustments of population levels to rapidly expand worker bee populations after nectar becomes available in the spring, and, again, to rapidly cut off brood production when nectar ceases to be available in quantity. It meets periods of high nectar with high worker populations and consequently stores large quantities of honey and pollen during those periods. They are resistant to some diseases and parasites that can debilitate hives of other subspecies.
Anatomy and appearance
Carniolan honey bees are about the same size as the Italian honeybee race, but they are physically distinguished by their generally dusky brown-grey color that is relieved by stripes of a subdued lighter brown color. Their chitin is dark, but it is possible to find lighter colored or brown colored rings and dots on their bodies. They are also known as the &lt;U+2018&gt;Grey Bee&lt;U+2019&gt;.

Carniolan bees are nearly as big and long as the Western European black bees, though their abdomens are much slimmer. Furthermore, the Carniolan bee has a very long tongue (6.5 to 6.7 mm, which is very well adapted for clover), a very high elbow joint and very short hair.1
Character and behavior
Beneficial
considered to be gentle and non-aggressive
can be kept in populated areas.
sense of orientation considered better than the Italian honey bee race
less drifting of bees from one hive to a neighboring hive
when compared to the Italian race, they are not as prone to rob honey
able to overwinter in smaller numbers of winter bees; honey stores are conserved.
able to quickly adapt to changes in the environment
better for areas with long winters
rhythm of brood production very steep. Brood rearing is reduced when available forage decreases
small use of propolis
resistant to brood diseases
for areas with strong spring nectar flow and early pollination
forage earlier in the morning and later in the evening, and on cool, wet days.
Not beneficial
more prone to swarming if overcrowded
low ability to produce wax and build comb (not uniformly accepted as fact)
low ability to thrive in hot summer weather
strength of broodnest more dependent on availability of pollen
dark queen is difficult to find
