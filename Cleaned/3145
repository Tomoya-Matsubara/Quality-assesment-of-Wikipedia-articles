NFL career
Allen was drafted as the tenth overall pick on the first round of the 1982 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Raiders.11 In his rookie season in 1982, he rushed for 697 yards as he led the Raiders to the best record in the AFC with a strike-shortened 8-1 record and was elected as NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.12 The Raiders would lose to the New York Jets in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.
The next season, Marcus rushed for over 1,000 yards for the first time; he would do so again in 1984 and 1985.13 That season, he rushed for 1,759 yards and scored 11 touchdowns on 380 carries as he led the Raiders to a 12-4 record and the AFC West Title and was named the NFL MVP.14 During that time, he also caught 60 or more receptions for 3 years running (1983-85).15
Allen is best remembered for his heroics in Super Bowl XVIII. He ran for 191 yards, caught 2 passes for 18 yards, and scored 2 touchdowns in the Raiders 38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins.16 This included a 74-yard touchdown run,17 a record that was the longest run in Super Bowl history, until Super Bowl XL when it was broken by Willie Parker, by a single yard. His 191 rushing yards were also a Super Bowl record, which stood until Timmy Smith of the Redskins topped it with 204 yards in Super Bowl XXII. After the game he would join an elite group of players to win the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP (Roger Staubach, Jim Plunkett, Desmond Howard). Moreover, Allen put together one of the greatest postseasons by a NFL running back. On January 1, 1984 Allen put up 13 carried for 121 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Pittsburgh Steelers. One week later, Allen rushed 25 times for 154 yards and scored 1 time on a reception. In the Super Bowl Allen added 191 more rushing yards to his playoff totals. In total, Allen rushed 58 times for 466 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also added 118 yards and 1 touchdown on 14 receptions.18 
A stormy relationship with Al Davis developed, stemming from a contract dispute where Davis referred to Allen as a cancer to the team.19 He also missed most of the 1989 season with a knee injury. Allen ended up relegated to back up duty in his final three seasons with the Raiders. At one time, falling to fourth on the depth chart.20 Allen's strained relationship with Al Davis reached an all time low in December 1992. During halftime of the Raiders-Dolphins game on Monday Night Football, a taped interview with Al Michaels was broadcast with Allen stating that Davis &quot;told me he was going to get me.&quot;
Allen further stated &quot;I think he's (Davis) tried to ruin the latter part of my career, tried to devalue me. He's trying to stop me from going to the Hall of Fame. They don't want me to play.&quot;21
He left Los Angeles to join the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993, that year he rushed for only 764 yards, but scored 12 touchdowns22 leading the AFC,23 as he and Joe Montana led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship Game and was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year that season. Allen went on to play for the Chiefs for four more seasons, leading the team in rushing every year but his last. Allen's main contribution to the Chiefs was his leadership abilities. The Chiefs won more games than any other NFL team during his tenure in Kansas City. Allen made many contributions to charitable causes off the field in Kansas City. He also hosted his own talk show on Sunday mornings before Chiefs games. Allen retired after 1997 season.24 In 1999, he was ranked number 72 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Marcus is inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as an Oakland Raider.
In August 2005, Allen and CBS Sports parted ways. The network began to diminish Allen's role over the last few years. Allen currently works for the NFL Network and he contributes to the football section of realgm.com.
In 2008, Marcus Allen joined as a spokesman for a sports website OPENSports.com, the brainchild of Mike Levy founder and former CEO of CBS Sportsline.com. Allen also writes a NFL blog and occasionally answers members' questions for OPEN Sports.25
