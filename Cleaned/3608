Rolling stock
The motive power for the Piedmont is provided by 3 state-owned locomotives, of which two are EMD F59PHIs numbered 1755 (City of Salisbury) and 1797 (City of Asheville), and one (City of Raleigh) is a rebuilt GP40PH-2 numbered 17921 and originally used in the 1960s by the L&amp;N. Locomotives from Amtrak's national system, such as GE P42s, can be spotted working on the Carolinian.
State owned passenger cars on the Piedmont are refurbished coach cars originally built by Pullman-Standard and the St. Louis Car Company in the 1960s for the Kansas City Southern and Union Pacific. There are two lounge cars and one combination car originally built by the St. Louis Car Company in the 1950s and used by the United States Army.
All rolling stock is painted in special North Carolina livery (different from the national Amtrak livery), in a blue and silver color scheme with red accents.
