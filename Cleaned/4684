Maria Jane Connor (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Sutherland), is a fictional character in the UK television ITV soap opera, Coronation Street, portrayed by actress Samia Smith. The character first appeared on-screen on 19 May 2000.1 During her time on Coronation Street, Maria has been the centre of storylines such as giving birth to a stillborn baby, sleeping with her best friend's boyfriend and being widowed after eight months of marriage. She works as a hairdresser at Audrey Roberts' salon. On 21 April 2009, Smith announced she was three months pregnant with her first child and would be going on maternity leave in autumn 2009, coinciding with the return to the series of Maria's sister-in-law and arch-enemy Carla. She is expected to return in spring 2010.2
Development
Maria was created as a love interest for Tyrone Dobbs, and first appeared working as a kennel maid at her parents' kennels. Auditions were held for the role in 2000, and actress Samia Smith beat several rivals, including Kimberley Walsh and Suzanne Shaw, to win the part.3 Describing Maria's development as a character since her arrival on Coronation Street, the official website states: &quot;Maria has blossomed from working as a kennel maid to one of the Street's most glamorous young women. She laps up the male attention that her good looks bring her but playing footloose and fancy-free with the men in her life has gained her a bit of a reputation.&quot;4 Jenny Cockle, writing for the Sunday Mirror, has similarly observed that during the character's duration on the show, Maria has evolved from a &quot;dowdy kennel maid&quot; to a &quot;sexy siren&quot;.5
Commenting on the relationship between Maria, Liam and Carla prior to Maria and Liam's wedding, Smith assessed: &quot;I think Liam loves Maria but he is in lust with Carla.&quot;6 Discussing the scenes in which Maria give birth to a stillborn son, Smith described the research she put into filming the storyline to ensure authenticity: &quot;It was so important that I got it right and it wasn't too overdramatic. They were both the hardest and easiest scenes I've ever had to do, because the situation was so sad. I was absolutely emotionally drained at the end of it all. The midwife has a lot of experience of attending stillbirths, and she helped me work out how to play it so that it seems real. It scared me personally, though, because the idea of going through something like that is petrifying. They were the most challenging scenes I've ever done.&quot;7
On filming the delivery scene itself, she explained; &quot;There was a prosthetic baby, but the director didn't show it to me until filming started so I'd get the full impact. It looked so real and I just broke down.&quot;8 Smith also gave the insight that filming the storyline affected her on a personal level, leading to the discovery her own mother had gone through the same situation: &quot;Because of my mum, I wanted to do the scenes well but they left me feeling exhausted and drained. I know mum will be watching it at home, as will thousands of women who've been through it so I need to do it justice for them.&quot;9 In an interview for the Inside Soap Year book 2009, a point was made about the fact nothing nice seems to happen to the character and asked Samia about it, she replied &quot;I'd love Maria to be happy for a change! I sometimes wonder if the Corrie scriptwriters think I've got a dodgy smile or something, because Maria hasn't smiled for months&quot;.10
Asked how she felt about Maria's romance with Tony Gordon, the man responsible for Liam's death, Smith commented: &quot;It's freaked me out to be honest! It is a bit creepy, we can't deny that, considering everything that's happened between them! I think the writers have done a brilliant job in making it a slow burner and making it as realistic as possible to allow them to fall for each other. They have actually got quite a bit in common. They've both had their hearts broken by two people who they were very close to and considered the loves of their lives. Ultimately, they've forgotten everything that went on earlier this year with the accusations of murder and everything - that's all been brushed under the carpet..&quot;11
Storylines
Maria arrives in Weatherfield as the love interest of Tyrone Dobbs. Tyrone and Maria become engaged after he proposes on Blackpool Tower. Tyrone is led astray by Fiz Brown, however, and Maria ends the relationship. She is annoyed when her brother Kirk begins dating Fiz, though the two eventually become best friends and share a flat for a while.
Maria is attracted to John Lynley, the boyfriend of her friend Toyah Battersby. They have a one-night stand which results in her becoming pregnant. Maria has an abortion and initially claims that John raped her. When Toyah discovers the truth, she moves to Sheffield and Maria becomes an enemy of Toyah's mother Janice. When Toyah's sister Leanne returns to Weatherfield, she seeks revenge for Maria's betrayal of Toyah, sabotaging her burgeoning relationship with Nick Tilsley. After a string of brief affairs, Maria becomes close to Tyrone again, and eventually the pair reunite. Tyrone breaks off their second engagement after realising that Maria will never be happy with him. Although upset, Maria accepts his decision.
Maria later has an affair with builder Charlie Stubbs, who is dating Tracy Barlow at the time. When Tracy later murders Charlie, Maria testifies against her, helping to have her convicted. Maria then begins dating local entrepreneur Liam Connor, who had previously been warned off her by Charlie. Maria discovers she is pregnant, and Liam proposes. Liam's sister-in-law Carla has feelings for him, which causes Maria some anxiety, but they eventually marry happily. Two months later, Maria is horrified to realise that her unborn baby has stopped kicking.12 She is told that the baby has died and she must have her labour induced. She gives birth to a stillborn baby boy, named Paul after Liam's late brother.  Unbeknownst to Maria, Liam later cheats on her with Carla. The affair is discovered by Carla's fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Tony Gordon, who has Liam murdered on the same night Maria discovers she is once again pregnant. Maria goes on to learn about Liam's affair, and becomes suspicious of Tony when she discovers that he already knew, suspecting him of involvement in Liam's hit and run. She begins a harassment campaign against Tony, who considers killing Maria to silence her, and also tries to bribe her, offering to provide for her baby. Maria almost runs Tony over, causing him minor injuries, and he refuses to press charges against her.She later accuses Tony of murdering Jed Stone and Tony confesses to it in a psychological mind game but later Jed stone turns up in the pub and Maria is forced to eat humble pie and withdraw all her accusations.
At the same time, Carla discovers Maria was right all along and flees Weatherfield in February 2009, leaving Tony a broken man. When Maria finds Tony mourning at Liam's grave on her wedding anniversary, Maria calls a truce with him and in a sharp twist in the saga the two form a close friendship. Tony helps her through the later stages of her pregnancy, and they establish a firm friendship. When Maria goes into labour three weeks late as the two walk along a deserted beach, Tony delivers the baby, which she names Liam Anthony Connor, after Liam and Tony. Their relationship later becomes romantic after a 7 month close friendship which is very frowned upon by Maria's in-laws (the Connors) leading to much conflict as Helen brands Maria 'a tart' though they eventually bury the hatchet and accept Tony. On the anniversary of Liam's death, Tony proposes to Maria by Liam's graveside, and she accepts. Maria finally discovers the truth about Tony when he suffers a heart attack and confesses to Roy Cropper that he had Liam murdered. Roy's wife Hayley informs a heartbroken Maria. At first Maria refuses to believe it but during a dramatic final scene between Tony and Maria, Tony confesses all to a furious Maria. This causes her to have an emotional breakdown. She does not believe that she is a fit mother to her baby. After a lot of moral support from Liam's grandparents Barry and especially Helen, Maria finally accepts that she is a fit mother to Liam and that she will take good care of him before deciding that she wants to accept an offer by Barry and Helen to stay with them in Ireland with baby Liam.
However, she gets an unexpected guest at her front door - Carla has returned. Carla demands an explanation of why Tony has been arrested even though she knew that its part of his involvement with Liam's death. At first Helen refuses Carla to come in, but Maria decides to do so. The two have a heart to heart in which Maria questioned Carla on the circumstances of her mysterious disappearance almost a year earlier and what the fight between her and Tony was about on the night she vanished. Maria told Carla of how she had witnessed Carla and Tony's fight spill on to the street and was suspicious that Carla knew he had murdered Liam. Carla lied and said it was because she had told Tony she'd always loved Liam,Maria then told Carla she loved Tony and the two called a truce. Maria then left for Ireland on the 26th of November on the day before Tony's hearing and her and Carla exchanges glances in her final scene. In December 2009, it was further revealed that Maria was informed off screen that Carla was in fact lying.
Reception
In 2006, the character won the Inside Soap 'Best Dressed' accolade.13 Grace Dent, writing for The Guardian, has been highly critical of Maria during her time on the show. In February 2006, she highlighted the unlikeliness of Maria's relationship with Tyrone Dobbs, writing: &quot;Maria Sutherland is one of those shiny, lithe, capricious, tidily-kept hairdresser girls who flutter around the Trafford Centre's Karen Millen store on Saturdays, trying on sparkly halter frocks, dreaming about snaring Rio Ferdinand. Tyrone Dobbs, on the other hand, looks like one of the Flumps.&quot;14 Following the death of Charlie Stubbs in January 2007, she deemed Maria to be the Street's &quot;local loose-knickered simpleton&quot;,15 and has also referred to her as being &quot;such a tit&quot;,16 and &quot;a pretty, perky, easily beddable dimwit&quot;.17
