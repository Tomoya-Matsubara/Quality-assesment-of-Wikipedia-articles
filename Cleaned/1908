 &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mac Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in was king of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata, ruler of modern Argyll, Scotland, and County Antrim, Ireland, from about 574 onwards. He was a contemporary of Saint Columba, and much that is recorded of his life and career comes from hagiography such as Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n of Iona's Life of Saint Columba. &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n appears as a character in many Old Irish and Middle Irish language works of prose and verse, some now lost.
The Irish annals record &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's campaigns against his neighbours, in Ireland, and in northern Britain, including expeditions to the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, and the east coast of Scotland. As recorded by Bede, &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was decisively defeated by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfrith of Bernicia at the battle of Degsastan. &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n may have been deposed, or have abdicated, following this defeat. He died in about 608.
Sources
The sources for &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's life include Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; Irish annals, principally the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach; and Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's Life of Saint Columba. &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n also appears as a character in the early Irish works Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus Aed&lt;U+00E1&gt;in maic Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in and Compert Mong&lt;U+00E1&gt;in. The Senchus fer n-Alban, a census and genealogy of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata, records his immediate descendants.
In the Rawlinson B. 502 manuscript, dated to c. 1130, is the tale Gein Branduib maic Echach ocus Aed&lt;U+00E1&gt;in maic Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in (The Birth of Brandub son of Eochu and of Aed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n son of Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n). This tells how &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was a son of Echu mac Muiredaig of the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; Cheinnselaig of Leinster, the twin brother of Brandub mac Echach (died c. 605–608). &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was exchanged at birth for one of the twin daughters of Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, born the same night, so that each family might have a son. The Prophecy of Berch&lt;U+00E1&gt;n also associates &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n with Leinster. A modern study concludes that &quot;[t]here seems to be no basis of fact behind these traditions&quot;.1
A lost Irish tale, Echtra &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;in mac Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in (The Adventures of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n son of Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n) appears in a list of works, but its contents are unknown.2 &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n is a character in the epic Sc&lt;U+00E9&gt;la Cano meic Gartn&lt;U+00E1&gt;in, but the events which inspired the tale appear to have taken place in the middle of the seventh century.3
Neighbours
&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was one among several kings in D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata and many in northern Britain and Ireland. D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata was later divided into three sub-kingdoms, although these divisions may post-date &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. These divisions were the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nGabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in, who took their name from &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's father, who ruled over Kintyre, Cowal and Bute; the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Loairn of northern Argyll; and the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l n&lt;U+00D3&gt;engusa of Islay. Within these there were smaller divisions or tribes which are named by the Senchus fer n-Alban.4 Details of the Irish part of the kingdom are less clear.
Looking outward, D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata's neighbours in north Britain were the Picts and the Britons. Late in &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's reign the kingdom of Bernicia would become the greatest power in north Britain.5
In Ireland, D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata formed part of Ulster, ruled by B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mac Cairill of the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Fiatach. The other major grouping in Ulster were the disunited tribes of the cruithne, later known as the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l nAraidi. The most important cruithne king in &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's time was Fiachnae mac B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;in. Beyond the kingdom of Ulster, and generally hostile to it, were the various kingdoms and tribes of the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill and their subjects and allies. Of the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill kings, &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed mac Ainmuirech of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Conaill, Columba's first cousin once removed, was the most important during &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's reign.6
Reign
 Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, the Senchus and the Irish annals state that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was a son of Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mac Domangairt (died c. 555–560). A Welsh poem says that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's mother was a daughter of Dumnagual Hen of Alt Clut.7 &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's brother Eogan&lt;U+00E1&gt;n is known from Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and his death is recorded around 597.8 The Senchus fer n-Alban names three other sons of Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, namely Cuildach, Domnall, and Domangart.9 Although nothing is known of Cuildach and Domangart or their descendants, Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mentions a certain Ioan, son of Conall, son of Domnall, &quot;who belonged to the royal lineage of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nGabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in&quot;,10 but this is read as meaning that Ioan was a kinsman of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nGabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in, and his grandfather named Domnall is not thought to be the same person as &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's brother Domnall.11
&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was around forty years old when he became king after the death of his uncle Conall mac Comgaill in 574.12 His succession as king may have been contested as Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n states that Columba had favoured the candidacy of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's brother Eogan&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.13 Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n claims that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was ordained as king by Columba, the first example of an ordination known in Britain and Ireland.14
In 574, following the record of Conall's death, the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Tigernach record a battle in Kintyre, at the unidentified Delgu or Teloch, but say only that &quot;D&lt;U+00FA&gt;nchad, son of Conall, son of Comgall, and many others of the allies of the sons of Gabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, fell.&quot;15 In 575, the Annals of Ulster report &quot;the great convention of Druim Cett&quot;, at Mullagh or Daisy Hill near Limavady, with &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed mac Ainmuirech and Columba in attendance.16 Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n reports that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was present at the meeting.17 The purpose of the meeting is not entirely certain, but one agreement made there concerned the status of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's kingdom. &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed agreed that while the fleet of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata would serve the U&lt;U+00ED&gt; N&lt;U+00E9&gt;ill, no tribute would be paid, and warriors would only be provided from the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata lands in Ireland.18
The reason for this agreement is presumed to have been the threat posed to &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, and to &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed, by B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mac Cairill. B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;n is said to have forced the king of D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata to pay homage to him at Rosnaree on Islandmagee, and this is thought to have followed &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's alliance with the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l Conaill. Ulster sources say that B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;n levied tribute from Scotland, and D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Riata is presumed to be meant, and he is known to have campaigned on the Isle of Man.19 Following B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's death in 581, the Ulstermen abandoned the Isle of Man, perhaps driven out by &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n who is recorded as fighting there in 583.20 Somewhat earlier, around 580, &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n is said to have raided Orkney, which had been subject to Bridei son of Maelchon, King of the Picts, at an earlier date.21
&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's campaigns on the Isle of Man have sometimes been confused with the battle against the Miathi mentioned by Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. The Miathi appear to have been the Maeatae, a tribe in the area of the upper river Forth. This campaign was successful, but &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's sons Art&lt;U+00FA&gt;r and Eochaid Find were killed in battle according to Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.22 This battle may have taken place around 590 and be recorded as the battle of Leithreid or Leithrig.23
The Prophecy of Berch&lt;U+00E1&gt;n says of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n: &quot;Thirteen years (one after another) [he will fight against] the Pictish host (fair the diadem).&quot; The only recorded battle between &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and the Picts appears to that fought in Circinn, in 599 or after, where &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was defeated. The annals mention the deaths of his sons here.24 It has been suggested that this battle was confused with the &quot;battle of Asreth&quot; in Circinn, fought around 584, in which Bridei son of Maelchon was killed. This battle is described as being &quot;fought between the Picts themselves&quot;.25
A number of Welsh traditions point to warfare between &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and King Rhydderch Hael of Alt Clut, the north British kingdom later known as Strathclyde. Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n reports that Rhydderch sent a monk named Luigbe to Iona to speak with Columba &quot;for he wanted to learn whether he would be slaughtered by his enemies or not&quot;. A Welsh triad names &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's plundering of Alt Clut as one of the &quot;three unrestrained plunderings of Britain&quot;, and the poem Peiryan Vaban tells of a battle between &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and Rhydderch.26 The lost Irish epic Orgain Sratha Cluada is usually thought to refer to the attack on Alt Clut in 870 by Vikings, but MacQuarrie suggests that it may refer to an attack by &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n on Rhydderch.27
Degsastan and after
Degsastan appears not to have been the first battle between &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n and the Bernicians. The death of his son Domangart in the land of the Saxons is mentioned by Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, and it is presumed that Bran died in the same otherwise unrecorded battle.28
Of the roots of this conflict, Bede says only that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was alarmed by &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfrith's advance. Wherever the battle of Degsastan was fought, Bede saw it as lying within Northumbria. The battle was a decisive victory for &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfrith and Bede says, carefully, that &quot;[f]rom that day until the present, no king of the Irish in Britain has dared to do battle with the English.&quot; Although victorious, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelfrith suffered losses as Bede tells us his brother Theodbald was killed with all his following. Theodbald appears to be called Eanfrith in Irish sources, who name his killer as M&lt;U+00E1&gt;el Umai mac B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;in of the Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nE&lt;U+00F3&gt;gain, son of High-King B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;n mac Ninnedo. The Irish poem Compert Mong&lt;U+00E1&gt;in says that the king of Ulster, Fiachnae mac B&lt;U+00E1&gt;et&lt;U+00E1&gt;in of the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l nAraidi, aided &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n against the Saxons, perhaps at Degsastan. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions that Hering, son of King Hussa of Bernicia, was present, apparently fighting with &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.29
After the defeat of Degsastan the annals report nothing of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n until his death around six years after the battle. His death is dated to 17 April 608 in the Martyrology of Tallaght, composed around 800. The Annals of Tigernach give his age as 74.30 The Prophecy of Berch&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, as well as placing his death in Kintyre, says &quot;[h]e will not be king at the time of his death&quot;, while the 12th century Acta Sancti Lasriani claims that he was expelled from the kingship. John of Fordun, writing in the 14th century, believed that &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n had been buried at Kilkerran in Kintyre.31
&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's descendants
&lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was succeeded by his son Eochaid Buide. Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n gives an account of Columba's prophecy that Eochaid's older brothers would predecease their father.32 &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's other sons are named by the Senchus fer n-Alban as Eochaid Find, Tuathal, Bran, Baith&lt;U+00E9&gt;ne, Conaing, and Gartnait.33 Adomn&lt;U+00E1&gt;n also names Art&lt;U+00FA&gt;r, who the Senchus calls a son of Conaing, and Domangart, who is not included in the Senchus. Domangart too may have been a grandson rather than a son of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, most likely a son of Conaing. The main line of Cen&lt;U+00E9&gt;l nGabr&lt;U+00E1&gt;in kings were the descendants of Eochaid Buide through his son Domnall Brecc, but the descendants of Conaing successfully contested for the throne throughout the 7th century and into the 8th.34
It has been suggested that Gartnait son of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported in about 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, it has been argued that Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's great-grandson.35
Of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's daughters, less is known. Maithgemm, also recorded as Gemma, married a prince named Cairell of the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Fiatach. The names of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n's wives are not recorded, but one was said to be British, and another may have been a Pictish woman named Domelch, if indeed the Gartnait son of Domelch and Gartnait son of &lt;U+00C1&gt;ed&lt;U+00E1&gt;n are one and the same.36
