Plot introduction
Inside Mr Enderby is the first book in the Enderby series and follows the life in Brighton (UK) of a mid-40s poet by the name of Francis Xavier Enderby. Enderby's career as a poet advances, and his career as a bachelor is put into jeopardy.
Plot summary
The story opens by introducing the dyspeptic poet, Francis Xavier Enderby. Enderby is in his mid-40's, a lapsed Catholic, who lives alone in Brighton as a 'professional' poet - his income being interest from investments left to him by his stepmother.
Enderby composes his poetry whilst seated on the toilet. His nearby bathtub serving as a filing cabinet is almost full of paper and food scraps that represent his efforts. Although he is recognised as a minor poet with several published works (and even awarded a small prize, the 'Goodby Gold Medal', which he refuses), he has yet to be anthologised.
He is persuaded to leave his bachelor life by the editor of a woman's magazine, one Vesta Bainbridge. Although it transpires that Ms Bainbridge was simply desirous of Enderby's capital, they remain married for almost a year.
Trivia

Literary significance &amp; criticism
&quot;Mr. Burgess is so fond of Enderby - by far his best creation - that he has devoted four books to him: Inside Mr. Enderby and Enderby Outside, which were published in 1968, The Clockwork Testament in 1975, and now, Enderby's Dark Lady.&quot; - Anatole Broyard, The New York Times.
