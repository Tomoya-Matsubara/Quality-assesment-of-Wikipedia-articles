Joseph Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;ter (1837-1894)1 was a noted German mycologist, doctor and scientist. 2 During his lifetime, he wrote several books and texts and discovered and described many species of flora and fungi. He also spent a considerable amount of time (around fifteen years, from 1871 to 1886) serving as a military doctor, particularly in the Franco-Prussian War, in places such as Spandau, Rastatt and Breslau, and rising to to the rank of colonel.
Life
Not much is known about Joseph Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;ter's childhood and youth, except that he probably spent those years in or close to Breslau, for that is where he was schooled. Similarly, not much is known about his relatives and family.
In 1855 Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;ter chose to study medicine in Breslau, Poland (a city today known as Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw), but, in 1856, he transferred to the Friedrich-Wilhelm Academy in Berlin, Germany. 3 In 1859 he earned his Doctor of Medicine degree. In the same year, he enlisted in the Prussian army, serving a a doctor in the Franco-Prussian war. 4 He occupied this post to the end of the war, in 1871, before being stationed at Spandau, and later Rastatt. 5 For his efforts as a doctor, as well as the various other contributions he made to the military (particularly during the Franco-Prussian War), Schr&lt;U+00F6&gt;ter was promoted to the rank of colonel rank in 1880. He was then stationed at Breslau, where he had been schooled. His career at the University of Breslau began six years later, in 1886, when he was appointed as a lecturer. 6 He stayed at the university teaching for several years, and became a professor in 1890. He died in 1894, after returning from an scientific expedition to Turkey. 7
