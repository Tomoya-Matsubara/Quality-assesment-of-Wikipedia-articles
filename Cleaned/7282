The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise or Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra) is the largest living species of tortoise and 13th-heaviest living reptile, reaching weights of over  and lengths of over . With life spans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived vertebrates. A captive individual lived at least 170 years.
The tortoise is native to seven of the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands, a volcanic archipelago about  west of the Ecuadorian mainland. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pago, meaning tortoise.
Shell size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks - on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with &quot;saddleback&quot; shells and long necks. Charles Darwin's observations of these differences on the second voyage of the Beagle in 1835, contributed to the development of his theory of evolution.
Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by exploitation of the species for meat and oil, habitat clearance for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. Ten subspecies of the original fifteen survive in the wild; an eleventh subspecies (C. n. abingdonii) had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed Lonesome George until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of captive-bred juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and it is estimated that the total number of the species exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, the species as a whole is classified as &quot;vulnerable&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Taxonomy
Early classification
The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of Gerardus Mercator and Abraham Ortelius, in about 1570.1 The islands were named &quot;Insulae de los Galopegos&quot; (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.234
Initially, the giant tortoises of the Indian Ocean and those from the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos were considered to be the same species. Naturalists thought that sailors had transported the tortoises there.5 In 1676, the pre-Linnaean authority Claude Perrault referred to both species as Tortue des Indes.6 In 1783, Johann Gottlob Schneider classified all giant tortoises as Testudo indica (&quot;Indian tortoise&quot;).7 In 1812, August Friedrich Schweigger named them Testudo gigantea (&quot;gigantic tortoise&quot;).8 In 1834, Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Marie Constant Dum&lt;U+00E9&gt;ril and Gabriel Bibron classified the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoises as a separate species, which they named Testudo nigrita (&quot;black tortoise&quot;).9

Recognition of subpopulations
The first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by Albert G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther of the British Museum, in 1875.10 G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther identified at least five distinct populations from the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos, and three from the Indian Ocean islands. He expanded the list in 1877 to six from the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos, four from the Seychelles, and four from the Mascarenes. G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nther theorised that all the giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken land bridges.11 This theory was later disproven by the understanding that the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos, Seychelles and Mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked by land bridges. It is now thought that the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoises descended from a South American ancestor,12 while the Indian Ocean tortoises derived from Madagascar.1314
At the end of the 19th century, Georg Baur15 and Walter Rothschild161718 recognised five more populations of Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise. In 1906, the California Academy of Sciences collected specimens and gave them to John Van Denburgh for study. He identified four additional populations,19 and proposed the existence of 15 species.20 His list still guides the taxonomy of the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise, though now ten populations are thought to have existed.21
Current species and genus names
The current species designation of nigra (&quot;black&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1824b22) was resurrected in 198423 after it was discovered to be the senior synonym (an older taxonomic synonym taking historical precedence) for the then commonly used species name of elephantopus (&quot;elephant footed&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Harlan, 182724). Quoy and Gaimard's Latin description explains the use of nigra: &quot;Testudo toto corpore nigro&quot; means &quot;tortoise with completely black body&quot;. Quoy and Gairmard described nigra from a living specimen, but there is no evidence that they knew of its accurate provenance within the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos &lt;U+2013&gt; the locality was in fact given as California. Garman proposed the linking of nigra with the extinct Floreana subspecies.25 Later, Pritchard deemed it convenient to accept this designation, despite its tenuousness, for minimal disruption to the already confused nomenclature of the species. The even more senior species synonym of californiana (&quot;californian&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1824a26) is considered a nomen oblitum (&quot;forgotten name&quot;).27
Previously, the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus Geochelone, known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus Chelonoidis was elevated to generic status based on phylogenetic evidence which grouped the South American members of Geochelone into an independent clade (branch of the tree of life).28 This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.29303132
Subspecies
The exact number of subspecies of Chelonoidis nigra that have existed is still under debate among scientists, but some recognize up to 15.33 Only ten subspecies now exist in the wild, one subspecies each on Santiago, Santa Cruz, San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal, Pinz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, and Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola, and five on Isabela, although this number is controversial and may be lower. An eleventh subspecies, abingdonii from Pinta Island, is now considered extinct and was represented by a single living specimen, named Lonesome George, until his death on 24 June 2012; George had been mated with female tortoises of several other subspecies, but none of the eggs from these pairings hatched. The subspecies inhabiting Floreana island (C. n.  nigra) is thought to have been hunted to extinction by 1850,3435 only fifteen years after Charles Darwin's landmark visit of 1835, when he saw shells but no live tortoises there.36 The existence of the phantastica subspecies of Fernandina is disputed, as it was described from a single specimen that may have been an artificial introduction to the island.373839
Prior to widespread knowledge of the differences between the populations (sometimes called races) from different islands and volcanoes, captive collections in zoos were indiscriminately mixed. Fertile offspring resulted from pairings of animals from different races. However, captive crosses between tortoises from different races have lower fertility and higher mortality than those between tortoises of the same race4041 and captives in mixed herds normally direct courtship only toward members of the same race.42
The valid scientific names of each of the individual populations are not universally accepted,43444546 and some researchers consider each subspecies to be a full species.4748 The taxonomic status of the various races is not fully resolved.49

Evolutionary history
All subspecies of Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater dispersal. The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair.50 Survival on the 1000 km oceanic journey is accounted for by the fact that the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water.51 As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the Humboldt Current, which diverts westwards towards the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands from the mainland.52 The ancestors of the genus Chelonoidis are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the Oligocene.53
The closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos giant tortoise is the Argentine tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between C. chilensis and C. nigra probably occurred 6&lt;U+2013&gt;12 million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands 5 million years ago.54 Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola and San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a &quot;stepping stone&quot; fashion via local currents.5556 Restricted gene flow between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern subspecies. The evolutionary relationships between the subspecies thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.57
Subspecies genetics
 Modern DNA methods have revealed new information on the relationships between the subspecies:
Isabela Island
The five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true subspecies or just distinct populations. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate subspecies.58 It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf subspecies (C. n. becki) while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.59 It is thought that tortoises from Santa Cruz first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (C. n. guentheri) and therefore form the subspecies C. n. vandenburghi (Alcedo) and C. n. microphyes (Darwin).60 The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (C. n. vicina) is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.1744&quot;/&gt; Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers they are all genetically different and should each be considered a separate subspecies.1744&quot;/&gt;
Floreana Island
Phylogenetic analysis may help to &quot;resurrect&quot; the extinct subspecies of Floreana (nigra) &lt;U+2014&gt; a subspecies known only from subfossil remains.61 Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of hybrids from a population transposed by humans from Floreana to Isabela,62 resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands,63 or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load.64 Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring. This allows the possibility of re-establishing a reconstructed subspecies from selective breeding of the hybrid animals.65 Furthermore, it is possible that individuals from the subspecies are still extant. Genetic analysis from a sample of tortoises from Volcan Wolf found 84 first generation nigra hybrids, some less than 15 years old. The genetic diversity of these individuals is estimated to have required 38 nigra parents, many of which could still be alive on Isabela island.66
Pinta Island
 The Pinta Island subspecies (abingdonii, now extinct) has been found to be most closely related to the subspecies on the islands of San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal (chathamensis) and Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola (hoodensis) which lie over 300 km (190 mi) away,67 rather than that on the neighbouring island of Isabela as previously assumed. This relationship is attributable to dispersal by the strong local current from San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal towards Pinta.68 This discovery informed further attempts to preserve the abingdonii lineage and the search for an appropriate mate for Lonesome George, who had been penned with females from Isabela.69 Hope was bolstered by the discovery of an abingdonii hybrid male in the Volc&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Wolf population on northern Isabela, raising the possibility that there are more undiscovered living Pinta descendants.70
Santa Cruz Island
Mitochondrial DNA studies of tortoises on Santa Cruz show up to three genetically distinct lineages found in non-overlapping population distributions around the regions of Cerro Monturra, Cerro Fatal and La Caseta.71 Although currently grouped into a single subspecies (porteri), the lineages are all more closely related to tortoises on other islands than to each other:72 Cerro Monturra tortoises are most closely related to duncanensis from Pinz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, Cerro Fatal to chathamensis from San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal, and La Caseta to the four southern races of Isabela.73
Subspecies of doubtful existence
Subspecies were described from three other islands, but their existence is based on scant evidence. The purported R&lt;U+00E1&gt;bida Island subspecies (wallacei) was described from a single specimen collected by the California Academy of Sciences in 1906,74 which has since been lost. This individual was probably an artificial introduction from another island that was originally penned on R&lt;U+00E1&gt;bida next to a good anchorage, as no contemporary whaling or sealing logs mention removing tortoises from this island.75 The phantastica subspecies from Fernandina is known from a single specimen &lt;U+2014&gt; an old male from the voyage of 1906.76 No other tortoises or remains have been found on the island, suggesting the specimen was an artificial introduction from elsewhere.777879 Fernandina has neither human settlements nor feral mammals, so if this subspecies ever did exist its extinction must have been by natural means, such as volcanic activity.80 The Santa Fe subspecies has no binomial name, having been described from the limited evidence of bone fragments (but no shells, the most durable part) of 14 individuals, old eggs and old dung found on the island in 1906.81 The island has never been inhabited by man nor had any introduced predators.82 The remains are considered artificial introductions,83 possibly from camping at the good anchorage on the island.84
Description
The tortoises have a large bony carapace (shell) of a dull brown colour. The plates of the shell are fused with the ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to the skeleton. Lichens can grow on the shells of these slow-moving animals.85 Tortoises keep a characteristic scute (shell segment) pattern on their shell throughout life, though the annual growth bands are not useful for determining age because the outer layers are worn off with time. A tortoise can withdraw its head, neck and forelimbs into its shell for protection. The legs are large and stumpy, with dry scaly skin and hard scales. The front legs have five claws, the back legs four.86
Gigantism
The discoverer of the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands, Fray Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s de Berlanga, Bishop of Panama, wrote in 1535 of &quot;such big tortoises that each could carry a man on top of himself.&quot;87 Naturalist Charles Darwin remarked after his trip three centuries later in 1835, &quot;These animals grow to an immense size ... several so large that it required six or eight men to lift them from the ground&quot;.88 The largest recorded individuals have reached weights of over 89 and lengths of .9091 The tortoises' gigantism was probably a preadapted condition for successful colonisation of these remote oceanic islands rather than an example of evolved insular gigantism. Large tortoises would have a greater chance of surviving the journey over water from the mainland as they can hold their heads a greater height above the water level and have a smaller surface area/volume ratio, which reduces osmotic water loss. Their significant water and fat reserves would allow the tortoises to survive long ocean crossings without food or fresh water, and to endure the drought-prone climate of the islands. A larger size allowed them to better tolerate extremes of temperature due to gigantothermy.92 Fossil giant tortoises from mainland South America have been described that support this hypothesis of preadapted gigantism.93
Shell shape
Galap&lt;U+00E1&gt;gos tortoises are the only lineage of giant tortoise exhibiting different types of shell shape.94 They exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from &quot;saddleback&quot; (denoting upward arching of the front edge of the shell resembling a saddle) to &quot;domed&quot; (denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome). When saddleback tortoises withdraw their head and forelimbs into their shells, a large unprotected gap remains over their neck, evidence of the lack of predation during the evolution of this structure. There is no saddleback/domed dualism, as tortoises can be of intermediate type with characteristics of both. Larger islands with humid highlands over  in elevation, such as Santa Cruz, have abundant vegetation near the ground.95 Tortoises native to these environments tend to have domed shells and are larger, with shorter necks and limbs. Saddleback tortoises originate from small islands less than  in elevation with dry habitats (e.g. Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola and Pinz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n) that are more limited in food and other resources.96
Evolutionary implications
In combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs,97 the unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach, which enables the tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as the Opuntia (prickly pear) cactus that grows in arid environments.98 Saddlebacks are more territorial99100 and smaller than domed varieties, possibly adaptations to limited resources. Alternatively, larger tortoises may be better-suited to high elevations because they can resist the cooler temperatures that occur when there is cloud cover or fog.101
A competing hypothesis is that, rather than being principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a secondary sexual characteristic of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by dominance displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size102 (see below). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males.103 The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.104
The saddleback carapace probably evolved independently several times in dry habitats,105 since genetic similarity between populations does not correspond to carapace shape.106 Saddleback tortoises are, therefore, not necessarily more closely related to each other than to their domed counterparts, as shape is not determined by a similar genetic background, but by a similar ecological one.107
Sexual dimorphism
Sexual dimorphism is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings, giving a more extreme saddled appearance.108 Males of all varieties generally have a longer tail and a shorter, concave undershell with thickened knobs at the back edge to facilitate mating. Males are larger than females &lt;U+2014&gt; adult males weigh around  while females are .109
Behaviour

Routine
The tortoises are ectothermic (cold-blooded) and therefore bask for 1&lt;U+2013&gt;2 hours after dawn to absorb the sun's heat through their dark shells before actively foraging for 8&lt;U+2013&gt;9 hours a day.110 They travel mostly in the early morning or late afternoon between resting and grazing areas. They have been observed to walk at a speed of .111
On the larger and more humid islands, the tortoises seasonally migrate between low elevations, which become grassy plains in the wet season, and meadowed areas of higher elevation (up to 112) in the dry season. The same routes have been used for many generations, creating well-defined paths through the undergrowth known as &quot;tortoise highways&quot;.113 On these wetter islands, the domed tortoises are gregarious and often found in large herds, in contrast to the more solitary and territorial disposition of the saddleback tortoises.
Tortoises sometimes rest in mud wallows or rain-formed pools, which may be both a thermoregulatory response during cool nights, and a protection from parasites such as mosquitoes and ticks.114 Parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil. Some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks.115  - others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in the earth or brush called a &quot;pallet&quot;. Local tortoises using the same pallet sites, such as on Volc&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Alcedo, results in the formation of small sandy pits.116
Diet
 The tortoises are herbivores that consume a diet of cacti, grasses, leaves, lichens, and berries. They have been documented feeding on Hippomane mancinella ('poison apple'), the endemic guava Psidium galapageium, the water fern Azolla microphylla, and the bromeliad Tillandsia insularis.117 A tortoise eats an average of  per day, with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos.118
Tortoises acquire most of their moisture from the dew and sap in vegetation (particularly the Opuntia cactus); therefore, they can survive long periods without water. They can endure 18 months when deprived of all food and water,119 surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a by-product. When thirsty they may drink large quantities of water very quickly, storing it in their bladders and the &quot;root of the neck&quot; (the pericardium120), both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships.121 On arid islands, tortoises lick morning dew from boulders, and the repeated action over many generations has formed half-sphere depressions in the rock.122
Senses
Regarding their senses, Charles Darwin observed that: &quot;The inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf; certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them. I was always amused, when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it would draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead.&quot;123 Although they are not deaf,124 tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing.125
Mutualism
Tortoises share a mutualistic relationship with some species of Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos finch and mockingbirds. Small groups of finches initiate the process by hopping on the ground in an exaggerated fashion facing the tortoise. The tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs, enabling the birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on the tortoise's body such as the neck, rear legs, cloacal opening, and skin between plastron and carapace. The birds benefit from the food source and the tortoises get rid of irritating ectoparasites.126
Some tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship. After rising and extending its limbs, the bird may go beneath the tortoise to investigate, whereupon suddenly the tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill the bird. It then steps back to eat the bird, presumably to supplement its diet with protein.127
A pair of tortoises engaging in a dominance display
Mating
Mating occurs at any time of the year, although it does have seasonal peaks between February and June in the humid uplands during the rainy season.128 When mature males meet in the mating season they will face each other in a ritualised dominance display, rise up on their legs and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open. Occasionally, head-biting occurs, but usually the shorter tortoise will back off, conceding mating rights to the victor. The behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback subspecies, which are more aggressive and have longer necks.129
The prelude to mating can be very aggressive, as the male forcefully rams the female's shell with his own and nips her legs.130 Mounting is an awkward process and the male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position. The concave underside of the male's shell helps him to balance when straddled over the female's shell, and brings his cloacal vent (which houses the penis) closer to the female's dilated cloaca. During mating, the male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts,131 described as &quot;rhythmic groans&quot;.132 This is one of the few vocalisations the tortoise makes; other noises are made during aggressive encounters, when struggling to right themselves, and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to the forceful expulsion of air.133
A young tortoise and a tortoise egg
Egg-laying
Females journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete.134 It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a  deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to sixteen spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from  in mass,135 and the size of a billiard ball.136 Some observations suggest that the average clutch size for domed populations (9.6 per clutch for porteri on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6 per clutch for duncanensis on Pinz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n).137 The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay 1&lt;U+2013&gt;4 clutches per season. Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings, with lower temperature nests producing more males and higher temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early will incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs that are laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).138
Early life and maturation
Young animals emerge from the nest after four to eight months and may weigh only  and measure .139 When the young tortoises emerge from their shells, they must dig their way to the surface, which can take several weeks, though their yolk sac can sustain them for up to seven months.140 In particularly dry conditions, the hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil, while flooding of the nest area can drown them. Subspecies are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces. The young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10&lt;U+2013&gt;15 years,141 encountering hazards such as falling into cracks, being crushed by falling rocks, or excessive heat stress. The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Hawk was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings; Darwin wrote: &quot;The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard&quot;.142 The hawk is now much rarer, but introduced feral pigs, dogs, cats and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises.143 The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans; Darwin noted: &quot;The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices. At least several of the inhabitants told me, they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause&quot;.144
Sex can be determined only when the tortoise is about 15 years old, and sexual maturity is reached at around 20&lt;U+2013&gt;25 years in captivity, possibly 40 years in the wild (when they reach their full size). Life expectancy in the wild is thought to be over 100 years,145146 making it one of the longest lived species in the animal kingdom. Harriet, a specimen kept in Australia Zoo, was the oldest known Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoise, having reached an estimated age of more than 170 years before her death in 2006.147 Chambers notes that Harriet was probably 169 years old in 2004, although media outlets claimed the greater age of 175 at death based on a less reliable timeline.148
Darwin's development of theory of evolution

Darwin wrote in his account of the voyage:
&quot;I have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the natural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands to a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My attention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr. Lawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any one was brought ... The inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the tortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in size, but in other characters. Captain Porter has described* those from Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as having their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle, while the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a better taste when cooked.&quot;150
The significance of the differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late, as he continued,
&quot;I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted&quot;.151
Even though the Beagle departed from the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these weren't for scientific study but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing. Their shells and bones were thrown overboard, leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses.152 It has been suggested153 that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal154 (chathamensis) and Santiago155 (darwini), both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other. Though he did visit Floreana, the nigra subspecies found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals.156
 However, Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands. These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain FitzRoy (two from Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola) and his servant Syms Covington (from Floreana).157 Unfortunately they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences.158 Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos was unknown.159 However, conversations with the naturalist Gabriel Bibron, who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that there were distinct varieties.160
Darwin later compared the different tortoise forms with those of mockingbirds, in the first161 tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos with the possibility of species transmuting:
&quot;When I recollect the fact that [from] the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; I must suspect they are only varieties ... If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks, the zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species.&quot;162
His views on the mutability of species were restated in his notebooks: &quot;animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances. &lt;U+2013&gt; Now Galapagos Tortoises, Mocking birds, Falkland Fox, Chiloe fox, &lt;U+2013&gt; Inglish and Irish Hare.&quot;163 These observations served as counterexamples to the prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created.
Darwin also found these &quot;antediluvian animals&quot;164 to be a source of diversion: &quot;I frequently got on their backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would rise up and walk away;&lt;U+2014&gt;but I found it very difficult to keep my balance&quot;.165
Conservation
Several waves of human exploitation of the tortoises as a food source caused a decline in the total wild population from around 250,000166 when first discovered in the 16th century to a low of 3,060 individuals in a 1974 census. Modern conservation efforts have subsequently brought tortoise numbers up to 19,317 (estimate for 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;2009).167
The subspecies C. n. nigra became extinct by human exploitation in the 19th century. Another subspecies, C. n. abingdonii, became extinct on 24 June 2012 with the death in captivity of the last remaining specimen, a male named Lonesome George, the world's &quot;rarest living creature&quot;.168 All the other surviving subspecies are listed by the IUCN as at least &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in conservation status, if not worse.

Historical exploitation
An estimated 200,000 animals were taken before the 20th century.169 The relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships, where they could survive for at least a year without food or water (some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years170), providing valuable fresh meat, while their diluted urine and the water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water. The 17th century British pirate, explorer and naturalist William Dampier wrote that &quot;They are so extraordinarily large and fat, and so sweet, that no pullet eats more pleasantly,&quot;171 while Captain James Colnett of the British Navy wrote of &quot;the land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed, was considered by all of us as the most delicious food we had ever tasted.&quot;172 US Navy captain David Porter declared that, &quot;after once tasting the Gallipagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation ... The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience.&quot;173 Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing &quot;the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do &quot;carne con cuero&quot;), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent.&quot;174
In the 17th century, pirates started to use the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on food and water and repairing vessels before attacking Spanish colonies on the South American mainland. However, the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because the islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources. As such, they remained unclaimed by any nation, uninhabited and uncharted. In comparison, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were already facing extinction by the late 17th century.175
Between the 1790s and the 1860s, whaling ships and fur-sealers systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than the buccaneers preceding them.176 Some were used for food and many more were killed for high grade &quot;turtle oil&quot; from the late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental Ecuador.177 A total of over 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868, and an estimated 100,000 were taken before 1830.178 Since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones, females were most vulnerable to depletion during the nesting season. The collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of, the scarcity of tortoises that they had created, and the competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source.179
Population decline accelerated with the early settlement of the islands in the early 19th century, leading to unregulated hunting for meat, habitat clearance for agriculture and the introduction of alien mammal species.180 Feral pigs, dogs, cats and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises, whilst goats, donkeys and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites. The extinction of the Floreana subspecies in the mid-19th century has been attributed to the combined pressures of hunting for the penal colony on the relatively small island, the conversion of the grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations, and the introduction of feral mammals.181
Scientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930, and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990. Threats continue today with the rapid expansion of the tourist industry and increasing size of human settlements on the islands.182
Modern conservation
The remaining subspecies of tortoise range in IUCN classification from extinct in the wild to vulnerable. Slow growth rate, late sexual maturity and island endemism make the tortoises particularly prone to extinction without help from conservationists.183 The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos giant tortoise has become a flagship species for conservation efforts throughout the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos.

Legal protection
The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos giant tortoise is now strictly protected and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.184 The listing requires that trade in the taxon and its products are subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for primarily commercial purposes is prohibited. In 1936 the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos to be a National Park185 and established the Charles Darwin Foundation. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned.186 To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969).187 A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter or disturb any organism, rock or other natural object in the National Park.188
Captive breeding
Breeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of the eight endangered subspecies up to less perilous population levels. Young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across the islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development. Eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites, and the hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood, before release onto their native ranges.189190
The most significant population recovery was that of the Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ola Tortoise (hoodensis), which was saved from near-certain extinction. The population had been depleted to 3 males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no mating in the wild had occurred.191 The 15 remaining tortoises were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station in 1971 for a captive breeding program192 and, in the following 33 years, they gave rise to over 1,200 progeny which were released onto their home island and have since begun to reproduce naturally.193194
Island restoration
The Gal&lt;U+00E1&gt;pagos National Park Service systematically culls feral predators and competitors. Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using &quot;Judas&quot; goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the &quot;Judas&quot; and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. This process was repeated until only the &quot;Judas&quot; goat remained, which was then killed.195 Other measures have included dog eradication from San Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;bal, and fencing off nests to protect them from feral pigs.196
Efforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises in order to restore their ecosystems (island restoration) to their pre-human condition. The tortoises are a keystone species, acting as ecosystem engineers197 which help in plant seed dispersal, trampling down brush and thinning the understory of vegetation (allowing light to penetrate and germination to occur). Birds such as Flycatchers perch on and fly around tortoises in order to hunt the insects they displace from the brush.198 In May 2010, 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to Pinta Island, the first tortoises there since the evacuation of Lonesome George 38 years ago in 1972.199 Sterile tortoises were released so that the problem of interbreeding between subspecies would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in the future. It is hoped that with the recent identification of a hybrid abingdonii tortoise, the approximate genetic constitution of the original inhabitants of Pinta may eventually be restored with the identification and relocation of appropriate specimens to this island.200 This approach may be used to &quot;re-tortoise&quot; Floreana in the future, since captive individuals have been found to be descended from the extinct original stock.201

The first navigation chart showing the individual islands was drawn up by the pirate Ambrose Cowley in 1684. He named them after fellow pirates or English noblemen. More recently, the Ecuadorian government gave most of the islands Spanish names. While the Spanish names are official, many researchers continue to use the older English names, particularly as those were the names used when Darwin visited. This article uses the Spanish island names.↩
