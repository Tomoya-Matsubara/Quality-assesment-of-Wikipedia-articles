Alitena is a town in northern Ethiopia, located in the Misraqawi (Eastern) Zone of the Tigray Region. Alitena was the administrative center of Irob woreda until Dawhan was made the new center prior to 2003.
Overview
Alitena is connected by a 35 kilometer road to Zalambessa, which was constructed under the inspiration and leadership of the local Roman Catholic priests, and opened 5 December 1974.1
Alitena has been an important Roman Catholic center in northern Ethiopia as early as 1845, when disciples of Justin de Jacobis converted some of the local residents from the Ethiopian Church.2 At Easter 1847 the Catholic missionaries de Jacobis and Guglielmo Massaia, together with four Ethiopian priests recently ordained by them, celebrated mass there in 1847. Although lacking churches, de Jacobis was fond of the people there, and considered Alitena as a possible place of refuge if there should be persecutions against the Catholics. Since 1934 the Lazarist Mission in Tigray had its main center at Alitena.3
