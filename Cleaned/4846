Chi Chi LaRue (born Larry David Paciotti on November 8, 1959 in Hibbing, Minnesota, United States) is a highly-regarded director of gay and bisexual pornography. He has also directed under the names &quot;Lawrence David&quot; and &quot;Taylor Hudson.&quot; As the LaRue persona is achieved through Paciotti donning drag, LaRue is alternately referred to as &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she.&quot;
Career
LaRue's earliest notice came when he moved to the Twin Cities area and began performing in drag as one-half of &quot;The Weather Gals&quot;, a &quot;hag drag&quot; revue. When he moved to California with a friend, his vast knowledge about porn and the porn industry got him hired at Catalina Video as an administrative assistant and publicist. LaRue worked at Catalina during the initial onslaught of the AIDS crisis, when many of the producers and directors in the gay porn industry were ill or dying.1 This created an opportunity for new producers like LaRue, who persuaded Catalina management to allow him to direct full-length videos.
LaRue has become a well known and prolific gay porn director. Having helmed literally hundreds of gay porn films since 1988, LaRue in 2003 also began to direct straight porn for colossus Vivid Video and quickly became a favorite among female stars, particularly Jenna Jameson. For some time, LaRue divided his attention between Vivid Video and his own Rascal Video, distributed by another company he co-owns, Channel 1 Releasing. Apart from the popular Live And Raw live streaming video feeds (which included the now-shuttered Live And Raw Hotel), LaRue is expanding his offerings to include branded line of dildos and other toys, as well as books, calendars and other merchandise.2
Safe sex stance
LaRue, a safe sex advocate, made waves when, in 2006, he announced he would no longer produce films for Vivid Video because they were filming and producing content featuring actors and actresses having sex without condoms. 3
Other activities
LaRue is an accomplished DJ, performing at many gay-themed events throughout the year.
In 2004, LaRue was photographed by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders for his monograph, XXX: Thirty Porn-Star Portraits. The layout accompanied an interview conducted by John Waters, a self-professed fan of LaRue's work. The &quot;directrix&quot; also appeared in a companion documentary titled Thinking XXX which ran on HBO. Other recent documentary appearances include Porno Valley (another HBO series) and Cycles of Porn: Sex/Life L.A., Part 2 (from director Jochen Hick).
In 1992, LaRue appeared in Madonna's video &quot;Deeper And Deeper.&quot;
In 2007, LaRue was chosen as one of Out Magazine's top 50 &quot;most powerful gay men and women in America.&quot;4
