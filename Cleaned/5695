U.S. Highway 266 is an east-west United States highway. It is only 42 miles (68 km) long, lies entirely within the state of Oklahoma, does not meet the former route of its parent, U.S. Highway 66, and is closely paralleled by Interstate 40.
Termini
 As of 2004, the highway's eastern terminus is in Warner, Oklahoma at an intersection with U.S. Route 64, duplexed with Oklahoma State Highway 2. Its western terminus is in Henryetta, Oklahoma at an intersection with U.S. Route 75 and U.S. Route 62.
Historic termini
In the original 1926 plan, US 266 extended to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to meet its parent route, U.S. Highway 66. But by 1931, along with changes to several other branches of US 66 1, the route was truncated at Henryetta. The segment from Oklahoma City to Henryetta became part of U.S. Highway 62, which was commissioned in 1930.
