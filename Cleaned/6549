Venni Vetti Vecci is the debut studio album by American recording artist Ja Rule, released through Murder Inc. Records. The album title alludes to the Latin phrase &quot;veni, vidi, vici&quot;, meaning &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;. The album was also the first release on Irv Gotti's Murder Inc. Records imprint. Before the end of 1999, the album had been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). This album, much like DMX's, It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, was a shift from Puff Daddy, Mase, and Bad Boy Records' &quot;shiny suit era&quot;.
Background and conception
Ja Rule was first featured on Mic Geronimo's &quot;Time to Build&quot; in 1995. Shortly after, he formed a group called Cash Money Click with his friends. The group was signed to TVT Records and recorded two albums, releasing one single before being dropped from the record label. Ja Rule called it a &quot;bullshit deal&quot; as TVT withheld the publishing royalties of the recorded material. While working as an executive for Def Jam Recordings, record producer Irv Gotti was hired as A&amp;R and convinced Ja Rule to sign onto the label.1
Russell Simmons, the Def Jam founder, CEO, and mentor to Gotti then decided to give Gotti the label he had wanted for so long. In 1998, Murder Inc. Records was founded. To promote and market Ja Rule, he placed him on songs with Jay-Z, LL Cool J, DMX, Cash Money Records, and Fat Joe. Due to Ja Rule's exceptional performances on these songs, Def Jam gave his album a release date.
The album title, Venni Vetti Vecci, refers to the Latin phrase &quot;veni, vidi, vici&quot;, which means &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;.2
Artwork
The album cover of Venni Vetti Vecci features Ja Rule with his head turned upward, eyes closed and hands clasped together, standing in front of a white statue of Jesus. The cover alludes to the biblical verses John 3:16 and John 3:18, signifying &quot;the father so feared the world that he left his only begotten son, in order to show that pain is love&quot;.3
Critical reception
Upon its release, Venni Vetti Vecci received generally mixed reviews. Ja Rule received several comparisons to fellow rappers Tupac Shakur and DMX.4 Writing for Vibe magazine, Shaheem Reid felt that the majority of the album was &quot;hampered by colorless production&quot;, stating that Ja Rule &quot;desperately needs tighter tracks to compliment his MC skills&quot;.5
Venni Vetti Vecci debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart. selling 184,000 copies in its first week.6 The album was certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America.7 As of November 2002, the album sold over two million copies worldwide.8
Aftermath
Ja Rule became one of the biggest hip hop stars, along with Jay-Z and DMX. Their albums, Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life, It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, and Venni Vetti Vecci, all gained notoriety and multi-platinum sales. Because of these albums, Ja Rule was able to tour with these artists as they formed a group entitled, Murder Inc., who fittingly signed to Murder Inc./Def Jam. He would be an opening act for Jay-Z and DMX on the 1998 Hard Knock Life Tour along with Memphis Bleek. The success of the album led to the credibility of Irv Gotti as a producer. The album, produced by Gotti was also overseen by Chris Lighty and Violator Management, ironically one of the companies that Ja Rule now has issues with.
