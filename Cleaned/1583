Saint-Georges is a station on Line 12 of the Paris M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro in the 18th arrondissement.
The station opened on 31 October 1912 as part of the extension of the Nord-Sud company's line A from Notre-Dame-de-Lorette to Pigalle. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro. The station is named after the Rue Saint-Georges, which became a street in 1734 and leads to the Place Saint-Georges, created in 1824. It was the centre of an estate created by the speculator Dosne, father-in-law of the politician Adolphe Thiers.
It was renovated during the early 2000s in imitation of the style adopted by the Nord-Sud Company, the original architects of the station. In fact, the current decorative style only vaguely resembles the original: the station name is no longer shown on large ceramic tablets (as at Solf&lt;U+00E9&gt;rino and Abbesses) and does not follow the original colour coding: the edge of the ceramic name tablets should be brown to designate a non-interchange station, rather than green.
