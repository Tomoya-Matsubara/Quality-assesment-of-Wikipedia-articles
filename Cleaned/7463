IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is a binary star system in the constellation Pegasus. The primary (IK Pegasi A) is a main sequence, A-class star that displays minor pulsations in luminosity.1 Its companion (IK Pegasi B) is a massive white dwarf; a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. They orbit around each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31 million kilometres, or 0.21 astronomical units (AU). This is smaller than the orbit of Mercury around the Sun.
This is the nearest known supernova progenitor candidate. When the primary begins to evolve into a red giant, it is expected to grow to a radius where the white dwarf can accrete matter from the expanded gaseous envelope. When the white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses, it will explode as a Type Ia supernova.2
Observation
This star system was catalogued in the 1862 Bonn Durchmusterung (&quot;Bonn astrometric Survey&quot;) as BD +18&lt;U+00B0&gt;4794B. It later appeared in Pickering's 1908 Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue as HR 8210.3 The designation &quot;IK Pegasi&quot; follows the expanded form of the variable star nomenclature introduced by Friedrich W. Argelander.
Examination of the spectrographic features of this star showed that characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least one of the stars, even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.4
In 1927, the Canadian astronomer William E. Harper used this technique to measure the period of this single-line spectroscopic binary, and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also initially estimated the orbital eccentricity as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.)5 The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component along the line of sight to the Solar System.6
The distance to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background), as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years).7 The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky due to its motion through space.
The combination of the distance and proper motion of this system can be used to compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system.8 The combination of these two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.
An attempt was made to photograph the individual components of this binary using the Hubble Space Telescope, but, unsurprisingly, the stars proved too close to resolve.9 Recent measurements with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer space telescope gave a more accurate orbital period of 21.72168 &lt;U+00B1&gt; 0.00009 days.10 The inclination of this system's orbital plane is believed to be nearly edge-on (90°) as seen from the Earth. If so, it may be possible to observe an eclipse.11
Component A
The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) is a plot of luminosity versus a color index for a set of stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.12
The pulsations result from a process called the &lt;U+03BA&gt;-mechanism. A part of the star's outer atmosphere becomes optically thick due to partial ionization of certain elements, which causes the atmosphere to expand in compensation. (That is, when these atoms lose an electron, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases; which heats and expands the atmosphere.) The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and looses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere, and a matching variation of the luminosity.13
 Stars within the portion of the instability strip that crosses the main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. These are named after the prototypical star for such variables: Delta Scuti. Delta Scuti variables typically range from spectral class A2 to F8, and a stellar luminosity class of III (subgiants) to V (main sequence stars). They are short-period variables that have a regular pulsation rate between 0.025 and 0.25 days. Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun's (see Population I stars), and between 1.5 and 2.5 solar masses.14 The pulsation rate of IK Pegasi A has been measured at 22.9 cycles per day, or once every 0.044 days.15
Astronomers define the metallicity of a star as the abundance of isotopes that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is [M/H] = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun.16 However the margin of error for this result is relatively high.
The spectrum of A-class stars such as IK Pegasi A show strong Balmer lines of hydrogen along with absorption lines of ionized metals, including the K line of ionized calcium (Ca II) at a wavelength of 393.3 nm.17 The spectrum of IK Pegasi A is classified as marginal Am (or &quot;Am:&quot;), which means it displays the characteristics of a spectral class A but is marginally metallic-lined. That is, this star's atmosphere displays slightly (but anomalously) higher than normal absorption line strengths for metallic isotopes.18 Stars of spectral type Am are often members of close binaries with a companion of about the same mass, as is the case for IK Pegasi.19
Spectral class-A stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun. But, in consequence, their life span on the main sequence is correspondingly brief. For a star with a mass similar to IK Pegasi A (1.65 solar), the expected lifetime on the main sequence is 2–3 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 109 years, which is about half the current age of the Sun.20
In terms of mass, the relatively young Altair is the nearest star to the Sun that is a stellar analogue of component A—it has an estimated 1.7 times the solar mass. The binary system as a whole has some similarities to the nearby system of Sirius, which has a class-A primary and a white dwarf companion. Sirius A, however, is more massive than IK Pegasi A and the orbit of its companion is larger, with a semimajor axis is 20 A.U.
Component B
The companion star is a dense white dwarf star. This category of stellar object has reached the end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through nuclear fusion. Instead, under normal circumstances, a white dwarf will steadily radiate away its remaining energy, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years.21
Evolution
Nearly all small and intermediate-mass stars (below about eight solar masses) will end up as a white dwarf once they have exhausted their supply of hydrogen and helium fuel.22 Such stars spend most of their energy-producing life span as a main sequence star. The amount of time that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on its mass, with the lifespan decreasing with increasing mass.23 Thus, for IK Pegasi B to become a white dwarf before component A, this white dwarf star must have once possessed the greater mass of the two. In fact progenitor for this star is estimated to have contained as much as 5 solar masses.24
As its hydrogen fuel at the core became consumed, this star evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium burning shell formed in addition to the hydrogen burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time this core too could initiate fusion of carbon into oxygen, with neon and magnesium as by-products.2526
The outer envelope of a red giant or AGB star can expand to several hundred times the radius of the Sun, occupying a radius of about 5 &lt;U+00D7&gt; 108 km (3 A.U.) in the case of the pulsating AGB star Mira.27 This is well beyond the current average separation between the two stars in this system, so during this time period the two stars shared a common envelope. As a result, the outer atmosphere of the smaller companion (A) may have received an isotope enhancement.28
 Some time after an inert oxygen-carbon (or oxygen-neon) core formed, thermonuclear fusion began to occurs along two shells concentric with the core region—with hydrogen being burned along the outermost shell, while helium fusion took place around the inert core. However this double-shell phase is unstable, so it produced thermal pulses that caused large-scale mass ejections from the star's outer envelope.29 This ejected material formed an immense cloud of material called a planetary nebula. All but a small fraction of the hydrogen envelope is driven away from the star, leaving behind a white dwarf remnant composed primarily of the inert core.30
Composition and structure
IK Pegasi B may have a core of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen.31 Covering the exterior is an envelope of almost pure hydrogen, which gives the white dwarf its stellar classification of DA. Due to higher atomic mass, any helium in the atmosphere will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer.32 The entire mass of the star is supported by electron degeneracy pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume.
 At an estimated 1.15 solar masses, this is considered to be a high-mass white dwarf. Although this object has not been observed directly, its radius can be estimated from the mass-radius relationships of white dwarfs.33 IK Pegasi B is about 0.91% of the Sun's radius.34 (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.)35 Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme density.
The massive, compact nature of a white dwarf produces a strong surface gravity. Astronomers denote this value by the decimal logarithm of the gravitational force in cgs units, or log g. For IK Pegasi B, log g is 8.95.36 By comparison, log g for the Earth is 2.99. Thus the surface gravity on IK Pegasi is over 900,000 times the gravitational force on the Earth.
The effective surface temperature is estimated to be about 35,500 ± 1,500 K,37 making it a strong source of ultraviolet radiation.38 Under normal conditions this white dwarf would continue to cool for more than a billion years, while its radius would remain essentially unchanged.39
Future evolution
Because of the presence of a high mass white dwarf in this binary, HR 8210 is a prime candidate for a Type Ia supernova. At a distance of 150 light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the Earth. However in the time it will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth and will pose no threat. A supernova would need to be within about 26 light years of the Earth to effectively destroy the Earth's ozone layer, thereby severely impacting the planet's biosphere.40
 At some point in the future, IK Pegasus A will have consumed the hydrogen fuel at its core and will start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasus A has expanded to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, then begins to accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars also causes their mutual orbit to shrink.41
On the surface of the white dwarf, the accreted gas becomes compressed and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion —a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly increases by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months.42 An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi; a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.4344
It is possible that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern.45 In order to accumulate mass, however, only a portion of the accreted gas can be ejected. So with each cycle the white dwarf steady increases in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B can continue to accumulate a growing envelope.46
An alternate model that allows the white dwarf to steadily accumulate mass without erupting as a nova is called the close-binary supersoft x-ray source (CBSS). In this scenario, the mass transfer rate to the close white dwarf binary is such that a steady fusion burn can be maintained on the surface as the arriving hydrogen is consumed in thermonuclear fusion to produce helium. This category of super-soft sources consist of high-mass white dwarfs with very high surface temperatures (0.5–1 × 106 K47).48
Should the white dwarf's mass approach the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses it can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result.49 If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, the collapse will cause a substantial fraction of the star to undergo nuclear fusion within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.50
Such a supernova event is not likely to pose a threat to life on the Earth, however. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4 km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700 years. After 5 million years, this star will be separated from the Sun by more than 500 light years. This is outside the radius where a Type Ia supernova is thought to be hazardous.51
Following a supernova explosion, the remnant of the donor star continues with the final velocity it possessed when it was a member of a close orbiting binary system. Thus it could have a relative velocity of 100–200 km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion would also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it would evolve into a single, white dwarf star.5253 The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.54
Notes
Based upon:
$$\frac{L}{L_{sun}} = \left ( \frac{R}{R_{sun}} \right )^2 \left ( \frac{T_{eff}}{T_{sun}} \right )^4$$ where L is luminosity, R is radius and Teff is the effective temperature.55
The net proper motion is given by:
$$\mu = \sqrt{ {\mu_\delta}^2 + {\mu_\alpha}^2 \cdot \cos^2 \delta } = 77.63\,\mbox{mas/y}$$. where μα and μδ are the components of proper motion in the RA and Dec., respectively. The resulting transverse velocity is:
Vt = μ ⋅ 4.74d (pc ) = 16.9 km. where d(pc) is the distance in parsecs.56
By the Pythagorean theorem, the net velocity is given by:
$$V = \sqrt{{V_r}^2 + {V_t}^2} = \sqrt{11.4^2 + 16.9^2} = 20.4\,\mbox{km/s}$$. where Vr is the radial velocity and Vt is the transverse velocity, respectively.
The median mass for this class of stars is about 0.54 solar masses, and only 2%57 of all white dwarfs have at least one solar mass.
R⋆ = 0.0091 ⋅ (6.96 × 108) m  ≈ 6, 300 km.
The surface gravity of the Earth is 9.780 m/s2, or 978.0 cm/s2 in cgs units. Thus:
log  g  = log  978.0 = 2.99 The log of the gravitational force ratios is 8.95 - 2.99 = 5.96. So:
105.96 ≈ 912, 000
From Wien's displacement law, the peak emission of a black body at this temperature would be at a wavelength of:
$$\lambda_b = (2.898 \times 10^6 \operatorname{nm\ K})/(35,500\ \operatorname{K}) \approx 82\,\mbox{nm}$$ which lies in the far ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
