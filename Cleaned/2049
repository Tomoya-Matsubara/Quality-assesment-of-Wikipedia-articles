 The Stadium District is a neighborhood of the north end of Tacoma, Washington, USA. It is named after Stadium High School, a historic landmark.
The district is located between the affluent North Slope residential neighborhood and the Hilltop neighborhood. The area shares more in common with Tacoma's downtown owing to its urban nature and large population of apartment-dwelling working class residents. The area consists primarily of businesses and apartment buildings, some with views of Commencement Bay. Like most of downtown Tacoma, the area is gentrifying.
