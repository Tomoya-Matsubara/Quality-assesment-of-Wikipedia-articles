Longford RFC is a Irish rugby team based in Longford, County Longford. They play in Division Two of the Leinster League. The club colours are black and white.
History
Longford can certainly stake a claim as one of the oldest clubs in Ireland. It is widely accepted that there was some rugby in the area during the 1890's, owing to the presence of two army garrisons. However, it was only in 1921 that the formal establishment of a club was recorded.
The club ceased its playing activities in the post-war years, but remained affiliated to the IRFU in order to secure tickets to international matches. They started playing again in 1967.
