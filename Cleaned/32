Adam Boyd (born 25 May, 1982) is an English footballer who currently plays for Luton Town. He plays as a striker and is well known for his goalscoring exploits and trickery, which has won him many admirers such as Alan Shearer1.
Childhood and early career
Boyd attended Grange Primary School and it was there where his talent was first spotted when the school&lt;U+2019&gt;s headmaster and PE coach, Mr. Cross, selected him to play for the year 6 side, despite only being 7 years old 2. While at Grange Primary School, Boyd barely missed a game for his school. He then attended the Hartlepool Manor School of Technology and his talent was once again recognized by the school&lt;U+2019&gt;s headmaster, Alan White, a teacher who had previously taught Steve Harper and Paul Kitson. He also played for 5 years with a Sunday League side called Hartlepool St Francis, where he started off by playing in central defence and helped the team win several trophies in the Teesside Junior Alliance league. Boyd&lt;U+2019&gt;s talent caught the eye of Middlesbrough who sent scouts to watch him. However, they decided against signing him and he signed for Hartlepool instead, the team he and his Dad supported and regularly watched.
Hartlepool United
Hartlepool Breakthrough
While at Hartlepool&lt;U+2019&gt;s youth team he quickly impressed the coaching staff of Mick Smith and Billy Horner. Despite only being in the youth team a short amount of time, he was given a shock last minute call up to the first team despite being just 16. Boyd eventually made his debut against Shrewsbury and was immediate success after coming on a substitute and scoring a dramatic last minute goal from the tightest of angles on his debut.3 However Boyd&lt;U+2019&gt;s early promise quickly faded as the youngster found himself languishing in the reserves and struggling to make an impact. 4 From the seasons 1999 to 2003 Boyd had started a total of 25 first team matches and made 38 substitute appearances. Despite this, Boyd had only managed to score 15 goals.
Under Neale Cooper and Onwards
Boyd&lt;U+2019&gt;s lack of first team appearances prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to  Boston United in order to gain match practice. During his time at Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring 4 goals before returning to Hartlepool5. Boyd returned 9lb over weight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed that he had been eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he said he had not started it yet. .6 Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. 7 However the two sides failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking for far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, which at the time seemed steep for an unproven striker and it was thought that Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure sum of around &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000. 8
Boyd was then a surprise inclusion in the team to face Stockport and came on as a sub after 45 minutes. The next game away at to  Grimsby saw Boyd get his first start of the season for Pools and score two goals. Boyd kept his place in the team and continued to score for the remainder of the season and notched an impressive 12 goals in 10 starts9. Neale Cooper noticed a change in Boyd's attitude and commitment to the club and made Boyd Hartlepool's first choice striker10.Boyd was also rewarded for his end of season form by being named the Powerade League One Player of the Month and the Goalscorer of the Month award. A football league spokesman described Boyd as &lt;U+201C&gt;finally delivering on his undoubted promise&lt;U+201D&gt;11.  The following season Boyd became one of the most feared strikers in League 1 and formed a strong partnership with fellow striker Joel Porter. He scored 29 goals in league and cup and became the club&lt;U+2019&gt;s highest goalscorer since Joe Allon in 1991. The pick of Boyd&lt;U+2019&gt;s goals came against Sheffield Wednesday where Boyd received the ball outside the box and faked his way past two players before chipping a lovely effort over  Sheffield Wednesday keeper Gallacher. This goal earned him two awards, Hartlepool United's Goal of the Season 2005 and the North East Goal of the Season 20051213. To top that off Boyd was also named Hartlepool United&lt;U+2019&gt;s Players&lt;U+2019&gt; Player of the Year14. Boyd ended the season strongly and scored a brace in the first leg of the play-off semi final match against Tranmere, which helped to secure Hartlepool&lt;U+2019&gt;s place in the play-off final for the first time in the club&lt;U+2019&gt;s history.
As Boyd gained critical acclaim, his value rocketed to &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million and he attracted the attention of clubs such as  Newcastle,  Liverpool,  Middlesborough and  Sunderland.15. However, Boyd remained at the club for the start of the 2006 campaign. Boyd started the season by scoring 2 goals in 4 starts. Unfortunately, Boyd picked up a long-term injury against Yeovil after bruising his bone. To make matters worse, Boyd&lt;U+2019&gt;s injury treatment went badly as he contracted a blood infection, which resulted him being out for 5 months. 16 Former manager Mike Newell, now of Luton Town, sought to take advantage of the effect that his injury had lowered his valuation and made Hartlepool two offers thought to be of approximately &lt;U+00A3&gt;500,000. However, Hartlepool rejected these offers17. Boyd returned to the first team 5 months later. Despite his return, Boyd struggled to overcome the effects of his injury and spent the majority of the time on the sidelines as the season drew to a close.
Luton Town Career
On 28th July 2006, Boyd signed a three-year contract with Luton Town after Hartlepool accepted a bid in the region of &lt;U+00A3&gt;500,000.18 Before leaving, Boyd thanked Hartlepool&lt;U+2019&gt;s coaches, managers and fans for helping him to develop and supporting him. He also thanked Chris Turner, Ken Hodcroft and Danny Wilson for allowing the transfer to happen so he could fulfil his ambitions.19 On his debut for Luton Town, he played a part in setting up Carlos Edwards' goal against Leicester to make the game 2-0.
Off Field Antics
Boyd has also become famous for his antics off the pitch after the ex-boyfriend of a woman he was in bed with caught them and assaulted him. Boyd was then forced to flee naked down a posh estate and suffered bruises and injuries to his feet20. Boyd refused to take any legal action against his attacker, claiming that he just wants to &quot;forget about it&quot;21.
