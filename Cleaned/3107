Technology of the Dune universe is a key aspect of the fictional setting of the Dune series of science fiction novels written by Frank Herbert, and derivative works. Herbert's concepts and inventions have been analyzed and deconstructed in at least one book, The Science of Dune (2008).123 Herbert's 1965 novel Dune is popularly considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time, was the first bestselling hardcover science fiction novel,4 and is frequently cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history.56 Dune and its five sequels by Herbert explore the complex and multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology and technology, among other themes. 
Atomics
 Atomics is the term used to refer to nuclear weapons in the Dune universe.7 Like real-world nuclear weapons, atomics presumably derive their destructive force from nuclear reactions of fission or fusion, and Herbert notes that &quot;Radiation lingers&quot; after their use.8 However, the author never delves into the specifics of the technology or explores in detail how it may have evolved by the time of Dune's far-future setting.
In the initial Dune novels, the Great Houses of the Landsraad own &quot;family atomics&quot; as heirlooms, keeping a secure, hidden cache as weapons of last resort in their wars.9 Though such possession is necessary to secure power, the use of atomics against humans violates the chief prohibition of the Great Convention, the &quot;universal truce enforced under the power balance maintained by the Guild, the Great Houses, and the Imperium.&quot;10 Paul Atreides notes in Dune that &quot;The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration.&quot;11 The atomics themselves act as a military deterrent — any House which violates the Great Convention flagrantly (such as using atomics openly in warfare) faces the possibility of massive retaliation from any number of the other Houses.12 As Paul notes via epigraph in Dune Messiah (1969), &quot;any Family in my Empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the planetary bases of fifty or more other Families.&quot;13
One type of atomic weapon is the stone burner, the explosion and radiation of which can be precisely adjusted depending on the desired effect.14 Stone burners emit &quot;J-Rays&quot;, a form of radiation that has a tendency to destroy the eye tissue of anyone surviving the initial radiation blast.15 If of sufficient power, a stone burner can burn its way into the core of a planet, destroying it:
Paul remained silent, thinking what this weapon implied. Too much fuel in it and it'd cut its way into the planet's core. Dune's molten level lay deep, but the more dangerous for that. Such pressures released and out of control might split a planet, scattering lifeless bits and pieces through space.16
The original series
In Dune, Paul uses an atomic device on the surface of Arrakis to blast a pass through a wild desert mountain range called the Shield Wall. He considers this act to be in accordance with the Great Convention because the atomics are not used against humans, but rather against &quot;a natural feature of the desert.&quot;17 A stone burner is used in an attempt to assassinate Paul in Dune Messiah; he survives but is blinded for the rest of his life.18 In God Emperor of Dune (1981), the God Emperor Leto II notes that since his 3,500-year reign began he has &quot;searched out all of the Family atomics and removed them to a safe place.&quot;19
Prequels
In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (1999-2001) it is revealed that a renegade House of the Landsraad had devastated the capital of the Corrino Padishah Empire, Salusa Secundus, with atomics and rendered the planet essentially uninhabitable.20 Padishah Emperor Hassik Corrino III had relocated the Imperial throne to the planet Kaitain, and the attacking House had been subsequently exterminated.21 During the events of the series in 10,175 A.G., Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV uses atomics to destroy House Richese's artificial laboratory moon of Korona.22 Part of Shaddam's plan to ensure his own spice monopoly, the explosion causes a quarter of the planet Richese's population go blind from the resulting light produced by the destruction of the Richesian mirrors stored on Korona.23 Finally, the persecuted Earl Dominic Vernius plans to use atomics to attack Kaitain; when his hidden base on Arrakis is discovered by the Padishah Emperor's Sardaukar army, Vernius ignites a stone burner to destroy himself and as many of the Sardaukar as he can.24
The Legends of Dune prequel series (2002-2004) establishes that the first human victory of the Butlerian Jihad (the crusade against the thinking machines) is the 200 B.G. destruction of Earth and the Earth Omnius using atomics.25 &quot;Pulse atomics&quot; calibrated for use against the gel circuitry of the thinking machines are also used at end of the war to systematically wipe out every single machine-controlled planet.26 It is this action, and the millions of human slaves who are killed in it, which ultimately leads to the ban on atomic warfare in the Great Convention.
Axlotl tank
Axlotl tanks are a fictional technology in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Axlotl technology is also mentioned in Herbert's novels Destination: Void and the The Jesus Incident but not elaborated upon. The name is presumably derived from the axolotl, an aquatic salamander native to Mexico known for its regenerative abilities.
A trade secret of the Tleilaxu, an axlotl tank is a &quot;device for reproducing a living human being from the cells of a cadaver,&quot;27 a type of clone called a ghola.28 Later in the series, the axlotl tanks are engineered to be capable of producing the spice melange, previously only available on the desert planet Arrakis.29
The original series
The tanks are briefly mentioned in Dune Messiah (1969) as the source of the Duncan Idaho ghola.3031 Their nature is a well-guarded Tleilaxu secret. During his 3500-year reign which ends in God Emperor of Dune (1981), Leto II purchases countless Idaho gholas produced for him in the tanks.32
Within the 1500 years between the events of God Emperor of Dune and Heretics of Dune (1984), the Tleilaxu discover an artificial method of producing the spice melange in their axlotl tanks as well.33
In Heretics of Dune, the Bene Gesserit Lady Janet notes to her son Miles Teg that &quot;No one outside of [the Tleilaxu] planets has ever reported seeing a Tleilaxu female.&quot; Wondering whether the Tleilaxu breed or simply rely on the tanks to reproduce, Miles asks, &quot;Do they exist or is it just the tanks?&quot; Janet confirms that females do indeed exist. Later in Heretics, Teg's own daughter, Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, theorizes that the axlotl tanks may be, in fact, &quot;surrogate mothers&quot; — Tleilaxu females somehow transformed.34 Soon, the current Duncan ghola recalls his repeated &quot;births&quot; from the tanks:
The axlotl tanks! He remembered emerging time after time: bright lights and padded mechanical hands. The hands rotated him and, in the unfocused blurs of the newborn, he saw a great mound of female flesh — monstrous in her almost immobile grossness ... a maze of dark tubes linked her body to giant metal containers.35
In Chapterhouse Dune, the last remaining Tleilaxu Master Scytale is coerced into revealing the means of creating the tanks to the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.36
Prelude to Dune
In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999-2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson (which occurs before the events of 1965's Dune), the Tleilaxu attempt to create artificial melange using axlotl technology; the best results are gained by using a Bene Gesserit sister to create an axlotl tank. However, the project ultimately fails.37
Cymek
A cymek is a type of cyborg, or machine-human hybrid, in the fictional Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. They appear in the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson. The only organic part of a cymek is its brain; in the series, living humans willingly have their brains transplanted into large mechanized bodies with the intent of extending life indefinitely.38
Prequels
Over 11,000 years before the events of Frank Hertbert's Dune (1965), a group of 20 ambitious humans see the stagnation of the Old Empire and realize that their small band can take control of it with the aid of thinking machines. Calling themselves the Titans, they rule humanity for a hundred years and rename themselves after famous historical and mythological figures, most notably Agamemnon, Ajax, Barbarossa, Dante, Hecate, Juno, Tlaloc and Xerxes.39
Ten years into their reign, their leader Tlaloc is killed in a freak accident. Realizing their mortality and limited lifespans, they seek a way to extend their lives. Juno is inspired by the cogitors, ancient philosophers whose brains had been installed in fluid-filled canisters so that they might analyze the universe indefinitely; they are living and retain awareness and consciousness, and the ability to communicate should they choose. The Titan Agamemnon is the first to become a cymek, his brain transplanted into a canister which, through special interfaces, is installed into a large, fearsome, and weaponized body. In cymek form, the remaining 19 Titans are virtually unstoppable, and continue their tyrnannical rule of the universe for another 90 years. Growing complacent, the Titans are themselves overthrown and enslaved by Omnius, a sentient computer network given too much autonomy; Omnius controls the universe for the next 900 years. The Titans recruit humans from the enslaved, Omnius-controlled &quot;Synchronized Worlds&quot; to become neo-cymeks, footsoldiers who could more fully understand human strategy and thought processes than machines.40
A small group of worlds, united as the League of Nobles, resist the initial Titan rebellion and remain free from machine rule. With the thinking machines ever-persistent in their intent to enslave or destroy all humans, the League initiates the Butlerian Jihad, mankind's century-long crusade against the machines. The humans are ultimately victorious, destroying Omnius, the Titans, the neo-cymeks and all thinking machine forces. With all thinking machine technology henceforth banned, new organizations arise, composed of humans who had developed specialized skills during the Jihad to replace and exceed technology, including the Spacing Guild, Mentats, and the Bene Gesserit.41
Ghola
A ghola is a form of clone grown in an axlotl tank from genetic material retrieved from the cells of a deceased subject, using a technological process developed and monopolized by the Tleilaxu.42
Heighliner
 A heighliner is a type of fictional starship used for interstellar travel in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. These enormous spaceships are the &quot;major cargo carrier of the Spacing Guild's transportation system.&quot;43
Duke Leto Atreides says of them in Dune (1965):
A Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into a little corner — we'll be just a small part of the ship's manifest.44
Heighliner operation requires both a Holtzman drive and a Guild Navigator. The drive uses the Holtzman effect to &quot;fold space&quot; and allow virtually instantaneous interstellar travel. The Navigator uses a limited form of prescience to find a safe path through folded space and guide the ship, which is made possible through the use of melange.45 Navigators are confined to giant tanks, completely immersed in highly-concentrated orange spice gas.46
Unable to land, heighliners jump from point to point, parking in planetary orbits. Orbital ferries or interplanetary spacecraft load and unload the heighliner. Special laws govern travel aboard a heighliner; heighliners are considered neutral territory and all acts of war aboard heighliners carry stiff penalties.
According to the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002-2004), heighliners are invented by Norma Cenva during the Butlerian Jihad.47 The Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999-2001) establishes that in subsequent millennia, the ships are manufactured on the planet Ix.48 During the events described in the 2001 prequel Dune: House Corrino, a heighliner is expertly spacefolded into a cavern under the surface of Ix, incapacitating an occupying army during the Atreides-led liberation of the planet.49
Holtzman effect
The Holtzman effect is a scientific phenomenon which makes defensive force shields and instantaneous space travel (among other things) possible through its application in Holtzman shields, foldspace or Holtzman drives, suspensors and glowglobes.50
Ixian Probe
An Ixian Probe is a fictional device in Frank Herbert's Dune universe used to capture the thoughts of a person (living or dead) for analysis.51 Ixian Probes are mentioned in Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984).52
As described in Heretics of Dune, the probe is an interrogation device of Ixian manufacture which &quot;can raid the mind even of a dead person.&quot; 53 However, the substance shere blocks the effects of the probe, and will protect a person who has taken it even in death.54 The probe itself or how it works are not described, but when Miles Teg sees a T-Probe for the first time, he believes it is an Ixian Probe.55 The T-Probe consists of a hood with a series of electrodes attached to the skull, controlled by an operator; the notable difference is that shere has no effect against a T-Probe.56
Lasgun
A lasgun is a handheld energy weapon, technically a &quot;continuous-wave laser projector.&quot;57
No-chamber/No-ship
 A no-chamber is a fictional technology in the Dune universe created by Frank Herbert. Originally called a no-room in Herbert's God Emperor of Dune (1981),58 it is a construct that hides anything inside from prescient vision, as well as more conventional means of detection.59 A no-globe is a larger construction of no-chambers, and a no-ship is a no-chamber in starship form, with enough limited prescience to be capable of interstellar travel without the use of a Guild Navigator.60
The original series
In God Emperor of Dune, Leto II deduces that the new Ixian Ambassador Hwi Noree had been &quot;born&quot; in what would come to be known as a no-room to shield her creation and upbringing from him.61 Hwi had been created by the Ixians from the cells of Leto's friend/nemesis Malky but as Malky's direct opposite — using Tleilaxu ghola technology — designed to be irresistible to Leto.62 The no-room is an improvement upon a device the Ixians had previously created for Leto to record his thoughts into a written journal and hide them from prescient vision.63
In Heretics of Dune (1984), Miles Teg, the Bene Gesserit Lucilla and the Duncan Idaho ghola hide in a no-globe on Gammu, created by the Harkonnens millennia before when the planet had been called Giedi Prime.64 It is a sizeable complex, noted to be &quot;Very ancient but the chambers are still intact and functioning.&quot;65 The exact era of its creation is not specified, but it is written that &quot;Gammu was Giedi Prime, a Harkonnen place ... They were rich ... Rich enough to accomplish the secret installation of a no-room ... even of a large no-globe ... Bribes, third-party purchases, many transshipments ... The Famine Times were very disruptive and before that there were all those millennia of the Tyrant ... When the Harkonnens kept their heads down or lost them.&quot;66
No-ships are in use at the time of Heretics of Dune; like no-chambers, anything inside a no-ship is hidden from prescient vision and other means of detection.67 However, a no-ship has much greater technological capability than a no-chamber, as it can perform the functions of a Guild Navigator.68 Specifically, a no-ship's computer is capable of enough limited prescience to successfully navigate its way through foldspace. Teg steals a massive no-ship from the fierce Honored Matres on Gammu in Heretics of Dune, and its Great Hold alone is noted to be one kilometer in length, large enough to transport an adult sandworm.69 In Chapterhouse Dune (1985), the Bene Gesserit initially confine Duncan and Murbella to this no-ship on Chapterhouse for their own protection from prescient spying. As Murbella becomes the leader of a New Sisterhood comprised of both the Bene Gesserit and Honored Matres, Duncan and Teg flee Chapterhouse with Sheeana and other passengers on the no-ship.70
In Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune it is suggested that certain characters with Atreides ancestry are capable of using their prescient powers to &quot;see&quot; no-ships.7172 The ability to nullify no-field invisibility is unleashed in Miles Teg after he is interrogated with to a device called a T-Probe.73 Teg's subsequent ghola duplicate also retains that unique ability after his memories are re-awakened.74
Sequels
In Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), the novels by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson which complete Frank Herbert's original series, the fleeing no-ship is named the Ithaca by its passengers in homage to the long journey of the mythological Greek hero Odysseus to his home of Ithaca. Accompanying Duncan, Teg and Sheeana are some 150 refugees, including the (apparent) last Tleilaxu Master Scytale, some Bene Gesserit Sisters and a group of secret Jews. They seek a new world onto which to introduce the captive sandworms on board, as well as a new home for the Jews, but are in constant pursuit by the Unknown Enemy who seek to ensnare the ship in an inescapable tachyon net. With the help of genetic material possessed by Scytale, the passengers of the Ithaca begin growing gholas of historical heroes such as Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica to assist them in the final battle they know is coming against the Unknown Enemy.7576
Prelude to Dune
In the Prelude to Dune prequel trilogy (1999-2001) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, the creation of the Harkonnen no-globe is attributed to a man named Chobyn.77 He invents the technology and builds the no-globe for Baron Vladimir Harkonnen immediately prior to the events of Dune (1965).78 However, Chobyn is killed and the technology lost79 until it is reinvented by the Ixians millennia later during the reign of Leto II.80
Stillsuit
 A stillsuit is a fictional body suit in Frank Herbert's Dune universe, first introduced in the 1965 novel Dune81 and appearing in every subsequent novel in the series. Stillsuits are worn by the native Fremen of the desert planet Arrakis to maintain their body moisture in the harsh environment.82 The Science of Dune (2008) analyzes Herbert's stillsuit and its feasibility in the real world as described.838485
Description
As described in Dune, a stillsuit is a &quot;body-enclosing garment&quot; of Fremen design which performs the &quot;functions of heat dissipation and filtering bodily wastes,&quot; as well as retaining and reclaiming moisture.86 As the planetologist Liet-Kynes is assisting Duke Leto Atreides with the fitting of his stillsuit, he explains it in this manner:
It's basically a micro-sandwich — a high-efficiency filter and heat-exchange system. The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body ... near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers . . . include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators. Salt's reclaimed. Motions of the body, especially breathing and some osmotic action provide the pumping force. Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck... Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to ensure a tight fit. Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day...&quot;87
Analysis
In his essay &quot;Stillsuit&quot; in The Science of Dune, John C. Smith suggests that &quot;Stillsuits designed using strict literal interpretations from the Dune books probably would not work and most likely would cook the wearer like a Crock-Pot ... However, engineering solutions can be envisioned for all the suit's shortcomings.&quot;88
T-Probe
A T-Probe is a fictional device in Frank Herbert's Dune universe89 used to capture the thoughts of a person (living or dead) for analysis. T-Probes appear or are referenced in Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984)90 and Chapterhouse Dune (1985),91 as well as the sequels Hunters of Dune (2006),92 and Sandworms of Dune (2007)93 by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.
As described in Heretics of Dune, the probe is a non-Ixian interrogation device brought by the Honored Matres from The Scattering. It is attached to the body through a series of &quot;medusa contacts&quot; placed around the skull and on major nerve centers. An operator can increase or decrease the power supplied to the probe to maximize its efficacy while at the same time not overloading the nervous system of the subject. While being subjected to the probe, Miles Teg's Mentat thinking deduces that not only can it &quot;command his body as though he had no thinking part in his own behavior,&quot; but also &quot;The whole spectrum of his senses could be copied into this T-probe and identified ... The machine could trace those out as though it made a duplicate of him.&quot;94 The probe builds a 'digital framework' of the person which can be subjected to stimuli, and will respond as the person would. The T-Probe also causes massive, virtually unendurable pain in a living subject. Unlike Ixian Probes, a T-Probe's function cannot be blocked by the substance shere. The T-Probe is what causes Miles Teg's brain to change its structure, giving him the blinding speed and amazing abilities seen in end of Heretics of Dune. This mental alteration continues in Teg even after being 'reborn' as a Tleilaxu ghola in Chapterhouse Dune.95
Weirding Module
A Weirding Module is a sonic weapon introduced in Dune, the 1984 David Lynch film adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel of the same name.
