 This is a list of countries without armed forces. The term &quot;country&quot; is used in the sense of independent state; thus, it applies only to sovereign states and not dependencies whose defense is the responsibility of another country or an army alternative. The term &quot;armed forces&quot; refers to any government-sponsored defense used to further the domestic and foreign policies of their respective government. Some of the countries listed, such as Iceland, San Marino, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, have no armed forces, but still have a non-police military force.123
Countries listed here typically have had a long-standing agreement with a former occupying country; for instance, the case between Monaco and France, which has existed for at least 300 years.4 Monaco, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau have no say in their respective country's defense matters, and have little say in international relations.5678 For example, when Micronesia negotiated a defensive agreement with the United States, it did so from a weak position because it had grown heavily dependent on American assistance.9 Andorra can request defensive aid if necessary, while Iceland had a unique agreement with the United States that lasted until 2006, which requires them to provide defense to Iceland when needed.1011 The remaining countries are responsible for their own defense, and operate without any armed forces. Some of the countries, such as Costa Rica, Dominica, and Grenada, underwent a process of demilitarization.1213 Other countries were formed without armed forces, such as Andorra over 700 years ago;14 the primary reason being that they were, or still are, under protection from another nation at their point of independence. All of the countries on this list are considered to be in a situation of &quot;non-militarization.&quot;15
