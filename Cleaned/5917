New York State Route 990V (officially New York State Reference Route 990V) is a reference route in Schoharie County, New York. It is one of only four reference routes that has been marked as a touring route in New York State. The route is an east-west running highway, spanning a distance of roughly six miles between its western terminus at NY 30 in Gilboa and its eastern terminus at County Route 3 in Conesville. Route 990V was once part of New York State Route 342 until being decommissioned for a routing in Jefferson County (over former NY 181).
Route description
 NY 990V begins at an intersection with NY 30 in the town of Gilboa northwest of the Schoharie Reservoir. The route heads south-east around the reservoir to the hamlet of Gilboa, where it crosses Schoharie Creek a short distance downstream from the Gilboa Dam. Outside of Gilboa, NY 990V turns to the southeast and parallels the eastern edge of the reservoir into the town of Conesville. The route remains the primary waterside roadway up to the hamlet of West Conesville, where NY 990V splits from the roadway and enters the Manor Kill Creek valley. The road continues eastward through West Conesville to the hamlet of Conesville, where it becomes County Route 3 at an intersection with Champlin Road and Bear Kill Road (CR 18) near the confluence of Manor Kill Creek and the Bear Kill River.1
The presence of touring route signage is unusual among reference routes. While most reference routes lack signage since they are considered too small or are known by other names or numbers, NY 990V is signed as a touring route, as are NY 961F2, NY 962J3 and NY 990L4, all reference routes. In fact, 990V is well-signed, and apparently is considered a minor touring route.5
History
What is now NY 990V was originally designated as New York State Route 342 in the 1930s. NY 342 also continued east to NY 145 in Durham by way of Schoharie County Route 3, Durham Road, and Greene County Route 20.6 By 1947, the route was shifted westward to begin at NY 23 at South Gilboa Station and end at the modern junction of CR 3 and Durham Road in Manorkill.7
By 1970, NY 342 was reassigned to the stretch of former NY 181 between Pamelia and Fort Drum in Jefferson County,8 giving way to a reference route (990V), as is often the case whenever a state route is removed or reassigned. The unique property of this &quot;replacement route&quot; is that, contrary to standard procedure, the reference route was signed as a typical touring route.9
