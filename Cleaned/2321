 Henri&lt;U+00EB&gt;tte Geertruida Knip (July 19, 1783 &lt;U+2013&gt; May 29, 1842) was a flower painter from the Northern Netherlands.
Knip was born in Tilburg as the daughter of the painter Nicolaas Frederik Knip. After her father went blind, she followed lessons from her older brother, Joseph August Knip, and in 1802 she followed him to Paris, where she took lessons from the flower painter Gerard van Spaendonck. She became a successful painter and spent summers in Haarlem painting the flowers of the various flower companies, and she spent winters in Amsterdam teaching ladies how to paint.
In 1824 she went back again to Paris, this time to take lessons from the flower painter Jan Frans van Dael. When her brother began to go blind, she was able to support his family as well as herself. She never married and died in Haarlem. Her work is sometimes confused with that of her niece Henri&lt;U+00EB&gt;tte Ronner-Knip, whose works generally contain animals.
