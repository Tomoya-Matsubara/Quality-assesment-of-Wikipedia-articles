Alexandre M&lt;U+00E9&gt;nard-Burrows (born April 11, 1981) is a Canadian professional ice hockey winger with the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is known for playing in the style of an agitator12 and for his ascension to the NHL from being an undrafted player in the ECHL.34
Playing career
Minor leagues
Burrows played two seasons of major junior in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Shawinigan Cataractes. Undrafted by an NHL club, Burrows joined the ECHL with the Greenville Grrrowl in 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;03. Late in his professional rookie season, he transferred to the Baton Rouge Kingfish and finished with a combined 32 points in 66 games between the two teams.
The following season, in 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04, he returned to the South Division, signed by the Vancouver Canucks' ECHL affiliate, the Columbia Inferno. He was suspended for three games and fined an undisclosed amount on November 3, 2003, for abusing officials during a game on October 24 against Greensboro Generals.5 He finished the season improving to 29 goals and 73 points, second in team scoring to league scoring champion Tim Smith.6 During the season, he was named to the 2004 ECHL All-Star Game for the Eastern Conference and recorded one assist.78 Following the competition, the Peoria Journal-Star, a local newspaper of the All-Star Game host city, conducted a survey of the NHL scouts in attendance and listed Burrows as one of the top four prospects at the game.9 Early in Burrows' All-Star season with Columbia, he was also signed by their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose on October 21, 2003,10 having been scouted by general manager Craig Heisinger.11 He debuted in 2 AHL games for them before being sent back down to the ECHL.
In the subsequent off-season, he was re-signed by the Moose on August 3, 2004.12 He was initially sent back down to the ECHL after a training camp he and head coach Randy Carlyle both described as disappointing.13 After being recalled on October 29, 2004, due to an injury to Wade Brookbank,1415 he scored his first AHL goal with the Moose on November 4, 2004, a game winning goal against David LeNeveu over the Utah Grizzlies in a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win.16 He finished the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 season with Manitoba and posted 26 points over 72 games in a fourth-line role.17
Vancouver Canucks
Having worked his way up from the ECHL, Burrows' energetic play in the minors earned him a two-way contract with the Moose's NHL affiliate, the Vancouver Canucks, on November 9, 2005.18 He had appeared earlier in the Canucks' training camp for the 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 season, but was sent back to the Moose.19 He received his first NHL call-up from the Canucks that season on January 2, 2006,20 and has since established himself on the team's roster. Shortly after being called up, Burrows scored his first career NHL goal and assist against Ed Belfour of the Toronto Maple Leafs in a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;3 win on January 10, 2006.21 Later that season, he added his first NHL career hat trick on March 27, 2006, in a 7&lt;U+2013&gt;4 win against the Los Angeles Kings.22 Splitting the season between the Moose and Canucks, he finished with 7 goals and 5 assists for 12 points in his NHL rookie campaign to go with 30 points in 33 AHL games. Burrows' ascension to the NHL has been attributed to his hard-working and abrasive style of play, generating energy and aggravating opposing players.23
 Burrows completed his first full campaign with the Canucks the following season in 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07. He contributed primarily on the team's penalty kill,24 which finished first overall in the league, but failed to significantly produce offensively. In 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08, Burrows formed an effective two-way shutdown duo with center Ryan Kesler, countering opposing teams' top lines while contributing offensively, as well.2526 He completed the season with a career high 12 goals, 31 points and a team high plus/minus of +11, resulting in his first of two consecutive team Most Exciting Player Awards.
After remaining on the third line with Kesler at the start of the following season, head coach Alain Vigneault separated the two after the All-Star break, placing Burrows on the first line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin, beginning on February 12, 2009, during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes.2728 Burrows' crash-the-net style combined well with the Sedin's cycling.29 Vigneault's line juggling was precipitated by a losing skid in January. The Canucks' winless streak extended to eight games and nine games at home until February 3, 2009, when Burrows broke a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;3 tie with a shorthanded breakaway goal with 82 seconds remaining in regulation.30 Soon thereafter, in the midst of another season of personal bests for Burrows, the Canucks extended his contract with a four-year, $8 million deal on February 4, 2009,31 quadrupling his $525,000 salary.32 On April 3, he was selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association as the Canucks' nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, awarded for perseverance, dedication and sportsmanship.33 Playing in a more offensive role on the first line for the latter part of the season, Burrows finished the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 season with a career-high 28 goals, 23 assists and 51 points. In the subsequent 2009 playoffs, Burrows scored the game winning overtime goal in game four to eliminate and sweep the St. Louis Blues in the first round. It was his second goal of the game.34 After being defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, it was revealed that Burrows was suffering from a left wrist injury, requiring off-season surgery, as well as minor left thumb and hip flexor injuries.35
 The following season, Burrows recorded back-to-back hat tricks against the Columbus Blue Jackets on January 5, 2010, and the Phoenix Coyotes on January 7. It marked the first time an NHL player notched consecutive three-goal games since Ilya Kovalchuk in November 2007 and the first time a Canucks player did so since Petri Skriko in 1986.36 With six goals and an assist, Burrows was named the NHL First Star of the Week on January 11, 2010.37 Later in the season, he left a game against the Los Angeles Kings after being hit in the throat by a Jarret Stoll slapshot.38
NHL officials controversy
The night of his first star of the week selection, Burrows and the Canucks played a controversial game against the Nashville Predators. With the game tied 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2 in the third period, Burrows was penalized twice by referee St&lt;U+00E9&gt;phane Auger &lt;U+2013&gt; once for diving and the other for interference.39 The latter call was deemed questionable by media sources, including TSN and the National Post.40 The interference penalty along with a tripping penalty committed by Henrik Sedin resulted in Nashville's game-winning, 5-on-3 powerplay goal late in the game.41 With three seconds to go in regulation, Burrows skated by Auger and protested the interference penalty, resulting in an unsportsmanlike minor and a ten-minute misconduct.42 Following the game, Burrows accused Auger of having a personal vendetta against him for a play against the Predators the previous month in December. After Burrows had been hit into the boards by Nashville forward Jerred Smithson, Auger assessed Smithson with a five-minute major and a match penalty that the league later rescinded because it was believed Burrows had dived.43 Burrows claimed that Auger told him before the January 11 game: &quot;you made me look bad so I'm going to get you back tonight.&quot; He went on to tell reporters that Auger &quot;should stay out for the rest of the year making calls like that ... We just blew two points because of his officiating tonight.&quot;44
The following day, the NHL fined Burrows US$2,500 for publicly criticizing Auger and deemed that his claims &quot;cannot be substantiated.&quot;45 Later that week, Hockey Night in Canada aired an 11-minute segment hosted by Ron MacLean and NHL vice-president Colin Campbell reviewing Burrows' past transgressions, spanning two years. The segment was widely criticized for being biased against Burrows and failing to illustrate both sides of the argument.46 Burrows' parents subsequently issued a formal letter of complaint to the CBC, accusing MacLean of &quot;verbal assassination&quot; and for displaying &quot;no journalistic balance.&quot;47 The following Saturday after the segment aired, the Canucks refused any interviews with the CBC before, during or after their game against the Chicago Blackhawks, which was broadcasted on Hockey Night in Canada. The boycott was ordered by Canucks general manager Mike Gillis.48
Ball hockey career
Before making it to the NHL, Burrows enjoyed a prolific ball hockey career, starting at the age of nineteen.49 While he played ice hockey during the hockey season, Burrows competed in annual national and international ball hockey tournaments during the off-season.50 In 2005, he won a world championship with Canada's national ball hockey team in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.5152 Later that summer, he led his Montreal-based team, the Red Lites, to a national championship, scoring 2 goals in a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;2 finals win against the Toronto Midnight Express.53 He returned the following year to lead the Red Lites to a sixth consecutive title in 2006.54 Voted in a 2006 poll as the country's greatest ball hockey player, Burrows has credited ball hockey for his fitness and discipline which has carried over to the NHL.55
Personal life
Burrows was born in Pointe-Claire, Quebec, to Rodney and Carole. His father immigrated from London, England, at 23, while his mother, a Quebec native, is an elementary school principal. Burrows has two sisters, as well &lt;U+2013&gt; one older and one younger.5657 He grew up speaking mostly French and attended French schools.58 He returns in the off-season to Montreal.59 Burrows' girlfriend is Nancy Roy.60
In the 2009 off-season, Burrows was involved in an assault incident while playing in a summer ice hockey league. Police were called to an arena in Kirkland, Quebec, on July 21 after Burrows allegedly struck a goaltender, 19-year-old Koray Celik, in the face. No arrests, however, were made at the scene.61
