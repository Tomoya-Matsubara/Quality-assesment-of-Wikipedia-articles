History
In the late 19th century all the English language schools in the area were run by Christian missionaries.3 In 1886 Williams Nevins Muthukumaru Sithamparapillai founded The Native Town High School. The school encountered financial problems and in 1889 it was taken over by S. Nagalingam who re-located it to Vananarponnai. The school was renamed Nagalingam Town High School.4 In 1890 the school was handed over to the Jaffna Saiva (Samaya) Paripalana Sabhai.5 The school was moved to its present site and renamed The Hindu High School.6
