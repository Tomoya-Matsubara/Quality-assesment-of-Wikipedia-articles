The Luxembourg film industry is quite small, but this is unsurprising given that the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has a population of only about 400,000 people. However, many films have been made in the country, both by native filmmakers and by people from other countries.
In 1993, Dammentour by Paul Scheuer (AFO-Productions) and Hochz&lt;U+00E4&gt;itsnuecht (Paul Cruchten) won awards at the Max Oph&lt;U+00FC&gt;ls Festival in Saarbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;cken.
