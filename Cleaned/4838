 Frances Evelyn Boscawen (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Glanville) (23 July 1719&lt;U+2013&gt;26 February 1805) was known as a literary hostess, correspondent and member of the Bluestockings Society.1
Frances Evelyn Glanville was born on 23 July 1719 at St Clere in Kent. In 1742 she married Edward Boscawen (1711&lt;U+2013&gt;1761). When Edward's work in the navy took him away from home Frances sent him passages from her journal, some of which were later published.234

Their children were:
Edward Hugh, born 13 Sept 1744, died 1774

After Boscawen's death in 1761, Frances returned to her London house at 14 South Audley Street, where she became an important hostess of Bluestocking meetings. Her guests included Elizabeth Montagu, Dr Johnson, James Boswell, Joshua Reynolds, Frances Reynolds, Elizabeth Carter, and later Hannah More, who described her as 'sage' in her 1782 poem The Bas Bleu, or, Conversation, published in 1784.5 Her widowhood inspired Edward Young's 1761 poem Resignation.6 She &quot;was widely known in literary London as a model letter writer and conversationalist, prized for her wit, elegance, and warm heart,&quot; according to a present-day scholar.78
Frances died at home in London 26 February, 1805.9
