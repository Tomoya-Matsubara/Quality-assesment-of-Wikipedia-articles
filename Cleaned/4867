Abu Qatada al-Filistini (), sometimes called Abu Omar (&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0628&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt; &lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;) has operated for fourteen years in London as the most influential terrorist cleric in Europe1. Under the name Omar Mahmoud Othman (&lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt; &lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+062D&gt;&lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+062F&gt; &lt;U+0639&gt;&lt;U+062B&gt;&lt;U+0645&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;), he is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations Security Council Committee 12672 for his affiliation with al-Qaeda. He is wanted on terrorism charges in Algeria3, the United States, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Italy, and his native Jordan4.
After the liberation of Kuwait from Iraq (which Abu Qatada opposed) he was expelled from Kuwait to Jordan. From there he travelled to the UK in 1993 on a forged UAE passport, and requested asylum on grounds of religious persecution. He was granted asylum the following year. He has been in British custody since his most recent arrest, in August of 2005, shortly after the London transit bombings. A British court ruled on 26 February 2007 that he may be deported to Jordan5. Appeals are pending.
Abu Qatada is a Jordanian national, having been born in Bethlehem in 19606, at which time the West Bank was part of Jordan. Al-Filistini means the Palestinian.
Writings and speeches
Abu Qatada opposes any authority that is not subordinate to Muslim clerical authority.7 There is no country anywhere whose government or regime he recognizes; he calls for the violent ouster of them all, and their replacement by a single Muslim theocracy.
One piece of his, Islamic Movements and Contemporary Alliances, which is widely cited by Sunni terrorists, argues essentially for no affiliation whatsoever between Muslim and non-Muslim countries.
Dozens of writings and a few audio recordings of Abu Qatada are stored on the Tawhed website, which is al-Qaeda's online library, run by the organization of Abu Qatada's fellow Jordanian Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi (who is the chief cleric of al-Qaeda in Iraq). Abu Qatada is frequently cited &lt;U+2013&gt; always with approval &lt;U+2013&gt; in the 2004 al-Qaeda policy paper called Management of Savagery.
His writings and speeches have been critically assessed by a contemporary Muslim scholar, Shaykh 'AbdulMaalik ar-Ramadani al-Jaza'iri, in the book Talkis al-'Ibad min Wahshiyyat Ab'il-Qataad aladhi yu'du ila Qatli'n-Nisa wa Awlad (Jeddah: Maktabah Asalah al-Athariyyah, 1422AH).The Savage Barbarism of Abu Qatada
Terrorist activities, affiliations, and influence
Abu Qatada has been described by Jamal al-Fadl, in his testimony in the Southern District Court of New York on February 6, 2001, as a member of al-Qaeda&lt;U+2019&gt;s &quot;Fatwa Committee&quot;. According to the indictment of the Madrid al-Qaeda cell, Abu Qatada was the spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in Europe, and the spiritual leader of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), and the Tunisian Combat Group.8 (One of Abu Qatada's Tunisian admirers is Sami Essid.)
In 1997 Abu Qatada ordered his followers to kill the wives and children of Egyptian police and army officers.9
While free in the UK Abu Qatada was the editor-in-chief of GIA's Al-Ansar magazine, and contributed fatwas to that magazine authorizing the indiscriminate mass murder of random Algerians. (Mustafa Setmariam Nasar was an editor and contributor at the same time, when he too was in England with political refugee status.)
Abu Qatada is reported by the British press1011 to have been a preacher or advisor to al-Qaeda terrorists Zacarias Moussaoui and Richard Reid.
When questioned in the UK in February 2001, Abu Qatada was in possession of &lt;U+00A3&gt;170,000 cash, including &lt;U+00A3&gt;805 in an envelope labelled &quot;For the Mujahedin in Chechnya&quot;. He was not charged.12
Abu Qatada has been affiliated with Mohammed Omran, who heads the fundamentalist Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jemaah organization in Melbourne.
Nineteen video cassettes of Abu Qatada's sermons were found in the apartment of Mohamed Atta when it was searched after the September 11, 2001 attacks, which he led13.
Legal status
In early 2004, an immigration appeals committee, convened to decide whether Abu Qatada should be allowed at large at that time, ruled in part, &quot;The appellant was heavily involved, indeed was at the centre in the United Kingdom of terrorist activities associated with al-Qaeda&quot; and remarked also on &quot;his passionate exposition of jihad and the spread of Islam to take over the world.&quot;14 But soon thereafter, the Law Lords struck down the basis on which he was being held, and he was again released.15
Jordan sentenced Abu Qatada in absentia in 2000 to life imprisonment16 for his involvement in a plot to bomb tourists who would be in Jordan to attend the Millenium celebrations.
Offer to help negotiate the release of BBC journalist Alan Johnston
BBC journalist Alan Johnston was kidnapped, in Gaza by muslim extremists on March 13, 2007.171819 Johnston's captors demanded the release of dozens of captives, including Abu Qatada.
Abu Qatada has offered to help negotiate Johnston's release.202122
