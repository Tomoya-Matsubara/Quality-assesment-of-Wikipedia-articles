Pulse is the sixth studio album by American R&amp;B singer&lt;U+2013&gt;songwriter Toni Braxton, released May 4, 2010, on Atlantic Records. It is her first album in five years and serves as her debut for the Atlantic label after signing a new record deal. Production for the album took place during September 2008 to March 2010 and was handled by several record producers, including David Foster, Harvey Mason, Jr., Frank E, Oak, Lucas Secon, and Dapo Torimiro. Pulse features up-tempo songs and R&amp;B ballads with production varying from smooth to dance-based styles.
The album debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 54,000 copies in its first week. It became Braxton's fifth US top-ten album and produced three singles that achieved moderate chart success. Upon its release, Pulse received generally positive reviews from most music critics.
Background
In October 2009 Atlantic Records chairman Craig Kallaman revealed that the label had signed Braxton and had the following to say &quot;Last year [2008], we had the rare opportunity to bring another R&amp;B icon into the Atlantic family, and for me it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Toni Braxton is not only one of the greatest voices of all time, but she is a charismatic superstar with an incredible list of achievements.&quot;1
Production for the album took place during September 2008 to March 2010 and was handled by several record producers, including David Foster, Harvey Mason, Jr., Frank E, Oak, Lucas Secon, and Dapo Torimiro.23 The entertainment outlet Rap-Up revealed that Braxton's album would feature collaborations with Lucas Secon; Harvey Mason, Jr.; Warren &quot;Oak&quot; Felder; and Troy Taylor4 as well as collaborations with Robin Thicke, Trey Songz, Usher5 and other reported collaborations included Claude Kelly, Frank E, Steve Mac, Dapo Torimiro and David Foster.6 R&amp;B songwriter and singer Ne-Yo also worked on songs for the album.7
Speaking of the thinking behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to noted UK R&amp;B writer Pete Lewis - Deputy Editor of Blues &amp; Soul - in May 2010: &quot;It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, and there was this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope - the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again - her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life.&quot;8
Music
She explained in an interview with Digital Spy that she had recorded around 30 songs and would like to collaborate with Alicia Keys.9 Braxton also explained the delay of the album: &quot;The album was supposed to come out in February, but we held it back because seven of the ten songs we picked were leaked. We decided to go back to the studio, record four or five more songs and then pick. Now we send everything via Federal Express - nothing's going through the internet - and that's why none of the new songs have leaked so far.&quot;10 The song &quot;Woman&quot; is a cover version of the original song by Delta Goodrem from her 2007 album Delta.11
Of the many planned collaborations none made the final album pressings. However the deluxe edition of the album on the iTunes store12 contains several of them as bonus tracks including the remix of &quot;Yesterday&quot; featuring Trey Songz, &quot;The Wave&quot; written by Jesse McCartney and Makeba Riddick.13, &quot;Stay&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot; and &quot;Yesterday (Cutmore Radio Remix)&quot;. It also features the high publicised &quot;Caught (Don't Take Your Hat Off)&quot; featuring Academy Award winning actress Mo'Nique14 who appears in the middle of the song with a dramatic monologue.15
A collaboration with R&amp;B singer Robin Thicke called &quot;Don't Leave&quot; would have featured on Braxton's vocals with Thicke providing production.16 Whilst the high profile collaboration with fellow R&amp;B singer Usher also failed to materialize.17 Amongst reports that Braxton was working with Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, a song tipped to be produced by Darkchild called &quot;Get Loose&quot; was also omitted from the album.18 Additionally reggae singer Sean Paul recorded some vocals for a remix of &quot;Lookin' At Me&quot; but it is currently unknown what will become of the remix since it is not featured on the album.19
Release and promotion
The album was originally scheduled for release in 2009, but then pushed back to February 2, 2010 before ultimately being released May 4, 2010 on Atlantic Records.20 Braxton told Rap-Up that the album had been pushed back because seven of the album's ten songs had leaked and so she had decided to go back into the studio to record new songs.21 The official cover art of the album was released on March 9, 2010.22 Amazon.com streamed a different song from Pulse each week up until the album's release day.23 Braxton performed &quot;Make My Heart&quot; on The Ellen Show on 27 April 2010, The Wendy Williams Show and gave an interview on Good Day L.A..24 On 3 May 2010 she performed &quot;Hands Tied&quot; and &quot;Breathe Again&quot; on The Mo'Nique Show.25 &quot;Hands Tied&quot; was also performed on 4 May 2010 on The Today Show along with her most successful single &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;.26

It was then confirmed that she would film videos for two new singles: &quot;Make My Heart&quot; and &quot;Hands Tied&quot; in March 2010 with director Bille Woodruff who worked with Braxton previously including on the video for &quot;Unbreak My Heart and He Wasn't Man Enough&quot;.27 The video for &quot;Make My Heart&quot; premiered on April 1328 whilst the video for &quot;Hands Tied&quot; was released on April 14, 2010.29 The latter has so far peaked at #31 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs.3031

Critical response

In contrast, Los Angeles Times writer Mikael Wood gave it 2 out of 4 stars and expressed a mixed response to &quot;her attempt to keep up with&quot; contemporary R&amp;B artists, writing that &quot;the flimsy material can't quite conceal her hit-hungry desperation&quot;.43 BBC Online's Natalie Shaw shared a similar sentiment, writing that the album &quot;misfires when its slower numbers are interspersed with uptempo tracks ready-made for the younger market&quot;.44 Mark Edward Nero of About.com gave the album 3 out of 5 stars and wrote that &quot;no new ground is broken, no significant risks are taken and the album as a whole is doesn't really have any must-hear tracks&quot;, but recommended it to listeners of Braxton's previous work and noted that she &quot;can still sing strongly and passionately&quot;.45 The Washington Post{{'}}s Sarah Godfrey commended the album's &quot;club tracks&quot; and wrote favorably of Braxton's &quot;trusty album architecture of scorching dance songs, soft-focused up-tempo ballads and &quot;Un-Break My Heart&quot;-style tear-jerkers without going too over-the-top&quot;.46
