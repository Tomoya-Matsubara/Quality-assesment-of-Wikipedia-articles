Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara (1; June 14,2 1928 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 9, 1967), commonly known as El Che or simply Che, was an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, intellectual, guerrilla leader, diplomat, military theorist, and major figure of the Cuban Revolution. Since his death, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol and global insignia within popular culture.3
As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout Latin America and was transformed by the endemic poverty he witnessed.4 His experiences and observations during these trips led him to conclude that the region's ingrained economic inequalities were an intrinsic result of monopoly capitalism, neocolonialism, and imperialism, with the only remedy being world revolution.5 This belief prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow solidified Guevara's radical ideology. Later, while living in Mexico City, he met Ra&lt;U+00FA&gt;l and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and invaded Cuba aboard the yacht, Granma, with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.6 Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the successful two year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.7
Following the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals,8 instituting agrarian reform as minister of industries, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba&lt;U+2019&gt;s armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion9 and bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles which precipitated the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.10 Additionally, he was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal manual on guerrilla warfare, along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful motorcycle journey across South America. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to incite revolutions, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and executed.11
Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century,12 while an Alberto Korda photograph of him entitled Guerrillero Heroico (shown), was declared &quot;the most famous photograph in the world.&quot;13
Early life
A teenage Ernesto (left) with his parents and siblings, ca. 1944. Seated beside him, from left to right: Celia (mother), Celia (sister), Roberto, Juan Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, Ernesto (father) and Ana Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a.
Ernesto Guevara was born to Celia de la Serna y Llosa and Ernesto Guevara Lynch on June 14, 192814 in Rosario, Argentina, the eldest of five children in a white Argentine family of Spanish, Basque and Irish descent.15 In lieu of his parents' surnames, his legal name (Ernesto Guevara) will sometimes appear with de la Serna, or Lynch accompanying it. In reference to Che's &quot;restless&quot; nature, his father declared &quot;the first thing to note is that in my son's veins flowed the blood of the Irish rebels.&quot;16 Very early on in life Ernestito (as he was then called) developed an &quot;affinity for the poor.&quot;17 Growing up in a family with leftist leanings, Guevara was introduced to a wide spectrum of political perspectives even as a boy.18 His father, a staunch supporter of Republicans from the Spanish Civil War, often hosted many veterans from the conflict in the Guevara home.19
Though suffering crippling bouts of acute asthma that were to afflict him throughout his life, he excelled as an athlete, enjoying swimming, soccer, golf, and shooting; while also becoming an &quot;untiring&quot; cyclist.2021 He was an avid rugby union player, and played at fly-half for the University of Buenos Aires First XV.22 His rugby playing earned him the nickname &quot;Fuser&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a contraction of El Furibundo (raging) and his mother's surname, de la Serna&lt;U+2014&gt;for his aggressive style of play.23 His schoolmates also nicknamed him &quot;Chancho&quot; (&quot;pig&quot;), because he rarely bathed, and proudly wore a &quot;weekly shirt.&quot;
Guevara learned chess from his father and began participating in local tournaments by age 12. During adolescence and throughout his life he was passionate about poetry, especially that of Pablo Neruda, John Keats, Antonio Machado, Federico Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Lorca, Gabriela Mistral, C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Vallejo, and Walt Whitman.24 He could also recite Rudyard Kipling's &quot;If&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot; and Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Hern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez's &quot;Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Fierro&quot; from memory.25 The Guevara home contained more than 3,000 books, which allowed Guevara to be an enthusiastic and eclectic reader, with interests including Karl Marx, William Faulkner, Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Gide, Emilio Salgari and Jules Verne.26 Additionally, he enjoyed the works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Vladimir Lenin, and Jean-Paul Sartre; as well as Anatole France, Friedrich Engels, H.G. Wells, and Robert Frost.27
 As he grew older, he developed an interest in the Latin American writers Horacio Quiroga, Ciro Alegr&lt;U+00ED&gt;a, Jorge Icaza, Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Dar&lt;U+00ED&gt;o, and Miguel Asturias.28 Many of these authors' ideas he cataloged in his own handwritten notebooks of concepts, definitions, and philosophies of influential intellectuals. These included composing analytical sketches of Buddha and Aristotle, along with examining Bertrand Russell on love and patriotism, Jack London on society, and Nietzsche on the idea of death. Sigmund Freud's ideas fascinated him as he quoted him on a variety of topics from dreams and libido to narcissism and the oedipus complex.29 His favorite subjects in school included philosophy, mathematics, engineering, political science, sociology, history and archaeology.3031
Years later, a February 13, 1958, declassified CIA 'biographical and personality report' would make note of Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s wide range of academic interests and intellect, describing him as &quot;quite well read&quot; while adding that &quot;Che is fairly intellectual for a Latino.&quot;32
Motorcycle journey
In 1948, Guevara entered the University of Buenos Aires to study medicine. However, his &quot;hunger to explore the world&quot;33 led him to intersperse his collegiate pursuits with two long introspective journeys that would fundamentally change the way he viewed himself and the present economic conditions in Latin America. The first expedition in 1950 was a 4,500 kilometer (2,800 mi) solo trip through the rural provinces of northern Argentina on a bicycle on which he installed a small motor.34 This was followed in 1951 by a nine month 8,000 kilometer (5,000 mi) continental motorcycle trek through most of South America. For the latter, he took a year off from studies to embark with his friend Alberto Granado, with the final goal of spending a few weeks volunteering at the San Pablo Leper colony in Peru, on the banks of the Amazon River.
Guevara (right) with Alberto Granado (left) aboard their &quot;Mambo-Tango&quot; wooden raft on the Amazon River in June of 1952. The raft was a gift from the lepers whom they had treated.35
On the way to Machu Picchu high in the Andes, he was struck by the crushing poverty of the remote rural areas, where peasant farmers worked small plots of land owned by wealthy landlords.36 Later on his journey, Guevara was especially impressed by the camaraderie among those living in a Leper Colony, stating &quot;The highest forms of human solidarity and loyalty arise among such lonely and desperate people.&quot;37 Guevara used notes taken during this trip to write an account entitled The Motorcycle Diaries, which later became a New York Times best-seller,38 and was adapted into a 2004 award-winning film of the same name.
In total, the journey took Guevara through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and to Miami, before returning home to Buenos Aires. By trip's end, he came to view Latin America not as collection of separate nations, but as a single entity requiring a continent-wide liberation strategy. His conception of a borderless, united Hispanic America sharing a common 'Latino' heritage was a theme that prominently recurred during his later revolutionary activities. Upon returning to Argentina, he completed his studies and received his medical degree in June 1953, making him officially &quot;Dr. Ernesto Guevara.&quot;3940 Guevara later remarked that through his travels of Latin America, he came in &quot;close contact with poverty, hunger and disease&quot; along with the &quot;inability to treat a child because of lack of money&quot; and &quot;stupefaction provoked by the continual hunger and punishment&quot; that leads a father to &quot;accept the loss of a son as an unimportant accident.&quot; It was these experiences which Guevara cites as convincing him that in order to &quot;help these people&quot;, he needed to leave the realm of medicine, and consider the political arena of armed struggle.41
Guatemala, Arbenz and United Fruit
Che Guevara's movements between 1953 and 1956, including his trip north to Guatemala, his stay in Mexico and his journey east by boat to Cuba with Fidel Castro and other revolutionaries
On July 7, 1953, Guevara set out again, this time to Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. On December 10, 1953, before leaving for Guatemala, Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from San Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Costa Rica. In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing through the &quot;dominions&quot; of the United Fruit Company, which convinced him &quot;how terrible&quot; the &quot;Capitalist octopuses&quot; were.42 This affirmed indignation carried the &quot;head hunting tone&quot; that he adopted in order to frighten his more Conservative relatives, and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased Joseph Stalin, not to rest until these &quot;octopuses have been vanquished.&quot;43 Later that month, Guevara arrived in Guatemala where President Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n headed a democratically elected government that, through land reform and other initiatives, was attempting to end the latifundia system. To accomplish this, President Arbenz had enacted a major land reform program, where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants. The biggest land owner, and one most affected by the reforms, was the United Fruit Company, from which the Arbenz government had already taken more than 225,000 uncultivated acres.44 Pleased with the road the nation was heading down, Guevara decided to settle down in Guatemala so as to &quot;perfect himself and accomplish whatever may be necessary in order to become a true revolutionary.&quot;45
In Guatemala City, Guevara sought out Hilda Gadea Acosta, a Peruvian economist who was well-connected politically as a member of the left-leaning Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA, American Popular Revolutionary Alliance). She introduced Guevara to a number of high-level officials in the Arbenz government. Guevara then established contact with a group of Cuban exiles linked to Fidel Castro through the July 26, 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba.46 During this period he acquired his famous nickname, due to his frequent use of the Argentine vocative interjection che, a slang casual speech filler used similarly to &quot;hey&quot; (as in &quot;hey, could you hand me a towel&quot; and not as a form of salute.)47
Guevara's attempts to obtain a medical internship were unsuccessful and his economic situation was often precarious. On May 15, 1954, a shipment of &lt;U+0160&gt;koda infantry and light artillery weapons was sent from Communist Czechoslovakia for the Arbenz Government and arrived in Puerto Barrios.4849 As a result, the U.S. CIA sponsored an army which invaded the country and installed the right-wing dictatorship of Carlos Castillo Armas.50 Guevara was eager to fight on behalf of Arbenz and joined an armed militia organized by the Communist Youth for that purpose, but frustrated with the group's inaction, he soon returned to medical duties. Following the coup, he again volunteered to fight, but soon after, Arbenz took refuge in the Mexican Embassy and told his foreign supporters to leave the country. Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s repeated calls to resist were noted by supporters of the coup, and he was marked for murder.51 After Hilda Gadea was arrested, Guevara sought protection inside the Argentine consulate, where he remained until he received a safe-conduct pass some weeks later and made his way to Mexico.52 He married Gadea in Mexico in September 1955.53
The overthrow of the Arbenz regime cemented Guevara's view of the United States as an imperialist power that would oppose and attempt to destroy any government that sought to redress the socioeconomic inequality endemic to Latin America and other developing countries. In speaking about the coup Guevara stated: 
Guevara's conviction that Marxism achieved through armed struggle and defended by an armed populace was the only way to rectify such conditions was thus strengthened.54 Gadea wrote later, &quot;It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism. By the time he left, he was sure of this.&quot;55
Mexico City and preparation
 Guevara arrived in Mexico City in early September 1954, and worked in the allergy section of the General Hospital. In addition he gave lectures on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and worked as a news photographer for Latina News Agency.56 His first wife Hilda notes in her memoir My Life with Che, that for a while, Guevara considered going to work as a doctor in Africa and that he continued to be deeply troubled by the poverty around him.57 In one instance, Hilda describes Guevara's obsession with an elderly washerwoman whom he was treating, remarking that he saw her as &quot;representative of the most forgotten and exploited class.&quot; Hilda later found a poem that Che had dedicated to the old woman, containing &quot;a promise to fight for a better world, for a better life for all the poor and exploited.&quot;58
During this time he renewed his friendship with &lt;U+00D1&gt;ico L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez and the other Cuban exiles whom he had met in Guatemala. In June 1955, L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez introduced him to Ra&lt;U+00FA&gt;l Castro who subsequently introduced him to his older brother, Fidel Castro, the revolutionary leader who had formed the 26th of July Movement and was now plotting to overthrow the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. During a long conversation with Fidel on the night of their first meeting, Guevara concluded that the Cuban's cause was the one for which he had been searching and before daybreak he had signed up as a member of the July 26 Movement.59 Despite their &quot;contrasting personalities&quot;, from this point on Che and Fidel began to foster what dual biographer Simon Reid-Henry deems a &quot;revolutionary friendship that would change the world&quot;, as a result of their coinciding commitment to anti-imperialism.60
By this point in Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s life, he deemed that U.S.-controlled conglomerates installed and supported repressive regimes around the world. In this vein, he considered Batista a &quot;U.S. puppet whose strings needed cutting.&quot;61 Although he planned to be the group's combat medic, Guevara participated in the military training with the members of the Movement. The key portion of training involved learning hit and run tactics of guerrilla warfare. Guevara and the others underwent arduous 15-hour marches over mountains, across rivers, and through the dense undergrowth, learning and perfecting the procedures of ambush and quick retreat. From the start Guevara was Alberto Bayo's &quot;prize student&quot; among those in training, scoring the highest on all of the tests given.62 At the end of the course, he was called &quot;the best guerrilla of them all&quot; by their instructor, Colonel Bayo.63
Cuban Revolution
Invasion, warfare and Santa Clara

The first step in Castro's revolutionary plan was an assault on Cuba from Mexico via the Granma, an old, leaky cabin cruiser. They set out for Cuba on November 25, 1956. Attacked by Batista's military soon after landing, many of the 82 men were either killed in the attack or executed upon capture; only 22 found each other afterwards.64 Guevara wrote that it was during this bloody confrontation that he laid down his medical supplies and picked up a box of ammunition dropped by a fleeing comrade, finalizing his symbolic transition from physician to combatant.
Only a small band of revolutionaries survived to re-group as a bedraggled fighting force deep in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where they received support from the urban guerrilla network of Frank Pa&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, the 26th of July Movement, and local campesinos. With the group withdrawn to the Sierra, the world wondered whether Castro was alive or dead until early 1957 when the interview by Herbert Matthews appeared in The New York Times. The article presented a lasting, almost mythical image for Castro and the guerrillas. Guevara was not present for the interview, but in the coming months he began to realize the importance of the media in their struggle. Meanwhile, as supplies and morale diminished, and with an allergy to mosquito bites which resulted in agonizing walnut-sized cysts on his body,65 Guevara considered these &quot;the most painful days of the war.&quot;66
As the war continued, Guevara became an integral part of the rebel army and &quot;convinced Castro with competence, diplomacy and patience.&quot;67 Guevara set up factories to make grenades, built ovens to bake bread, taught new recruits about tactics, and organized schools to teach illiterate campesinos to read and write.68 Moreover, Guevara established health clinics, workshops to teach military tactics, and a newspaper to disseminate information.69 The man who three years later would be dubbed by Time Magazine: &quot;Castro's brain&quot;, at this point was promoted by Fidel Castro to Comandante (commander) of a second army column.70
As the only other ranked Comandante besides Fidel Castro, Guevara was an extremely harsh disciplinarian who unhesitatingly shot defectors. Deserters were punished as traitors, and Guevara was known to send execution squads to hunt down those seeking to go AWOL.71 As a result, Guevara became feared for his brutality and ruthlessness.72 During the guerrilla campaign, Guevara was also responsible for the often summary execution of a number of men accused of being informers, deserters or spies.73
In his diaries, Guevara described the first such execution of Eutimio Guerra, a peasant army guide who admitted treason when it was discovered he accepted the promise of ten thousand pesos for repeatedly giving away the rebel's position for attack by the Cuban air force.74 Such information also allowed Batista's army to burn the homes of rebel-friendly peasants.75 Upon Guerra's request that they &quot;end his life quickly&quot;,76 Che stepped forward and shot him in the head, writing &quot;The situation was uncomfortable for the people and for Eutimio so I ended the problem giving him a shot with a .32 pistol in the right side of the brain, with exit orifice in the right temporal [lobe].&quot;77 His scientific notations and matter-of-fact description, suggested to one biographer a &quot;remarkable detachment to violence&quot; by that point in the war.78 Later, Guevara published a literary account of the incident entitled &quot;Death of a Traitor&quot;, where he transfigured Eutimio's betrayal and pre-execution request that the revolution &quot;take care of his children&quot;, into a &quot;revolutionary parable about redemption through sacrifice.&quot;79
In his trademark olive-green military fatigues, 2 June 1959
Although he maintained a demanding and harsh disposition, Guevara also viewed his role of commander as one of a teacher, entertaining his men during breaks between engagements with readings from the likes of Robert Louis Stevenson, Cervantes, and Spanish lyric poets.80 His commanding officer Fidel Castro has described Guevara as intelligent, daring, and an exemplary leader who &quot;had great moral authority over his troops.&quot;81 Castro has further remarked that Guevara took too many risks, even having a &quot;tendency toward foolhardiness.&quot;82 Guevara's teenage lieutenant, Joel Iglesias, recounts such actions in his diary, noting that Guevara's behavior in combat even brought admiration from the enemy. On one occasion Iglesias recounts the time he had been wounded in battle, stating &quot;Che ran out to me, defying the bullets, threw me over his shoulder, and got me out of there. The guards didn't dare fire at him ... later they told me he made a great impression on them when they saw him run out with his pistol stuck in his belt, ignoring the danger, they didn't dare shoot.&quot;83
Guevara was instrumental in creating the clandestine radio station Radio Rebelde in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by the 26th of July movement, and provided radiotelephone communication between the growing number of rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of CIA supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of Jacobo Arbenz Guzm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.84
In late July 1958, Guevara played a critical role in the Battle of Las Mercedes by using his column to halt a force of 1,500 men called up by Batista's General Cantillo in a plan to encircle and destroy Castro's forces. Years later, Major Larry Bockman of the United States Marine Corps would analyze and describe Che's tactical appreciation of this battle as &quot;brilliant.&quot;85 During this time Guevara also became an &quot;expert&quot; at leading hit and run tactics against Batista&lt;U+2019&gt;s army, and then fading back into the countryside before the army could counterattack.86
As the war extended, Guevara led a new column of fighters dispatched westward for the final push towards Havana. Travelling by foot, Guevara embarked on a difficult 7 week march only travelling at night to avoid ambush, and often not eating for several days.87 In the closing days of December 1958, Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s task was to cut the island in half by taking Las Villas province. In a matter of days he executed a series of &quot;brilliant tactical victories&quot; that gave him control of all but the province&lt;U+2019&gt;s capital city of Santa Clara.88 Guevara then directed his &quot;suicide squad&quot; in the attack on Santa Clara, that became the final decisive military victory of the revolution.8990 In the six weeks leading up to the Battle of Santa Clara there were times when his men were completely surrounded, outgunned, and overrun. Che's eventual victory despite being outnumbered 10:1, remains in the view of some observers a &quot;remarkable tour de force in modern warfare.&quot;91
After the battle of Santa Clara, January 1, 1959
Radio Rebelde broadcast the first reports that Guevara's column had taken Santa Clara on New Year's Eve 1958. This contradicted reports by the heavily controlled national news media, which had at one stage reported Guevara's death during the fighting. At 3 am on January 1, 1959, upon learning that his generals were negotiating a separate peace with Guevara, Fulgencio Batista boarded a plane in Havana and fled for the Dominican Republic, along with an amassed &quot;fortune of more than $ 300,000,000 through graft and payoffs.&quot;92 The following day on January 2, Guevara entered Havana to take final control of the capitol.93 Fidel Castro however took 6 more days to arrive, as he stopped to rally support in several large cities on his way to rolling victoriously into Havana on January 8, 1959. In mid-January 1959, Guevara went to live at a summer villa in Tarara to recover from a violent asthma attack.94 While there he started the Tarara Group, a group that debated and formed the new plans for Cuba's social, political, and economic development.95 In addition, Che began to write his book Guerrilla Warfare while resting at Tarara.96
In February, the revolutionary government proclaimed Guevara &quot;a Cuban citizen by birth&quot; in recognition of his role in the triumph.97 When Hilda Gadea arrived in Cuba in late January, Guevara told her that he was involved with another woman, and the two agreed on a divorce,98 which was finalized on May 22.99 On June 2, 1959, he married Aleida March, a Cuban-born member of the 26th of July movement with whom he had been living since late 1958. Guevara returned to the seaside village of Tarara in June for his honeymoon with Aleida.100 Guevara had children from both his marriages, and one illegitimate child, as follows: With Hilda Gadea (married August 18, 1955; divorced May 22, 1959), Hilda Beatriz Guevara Gadea, born February 15, 1956 in Mexico City; died August 21, 1995 in Havana, Cuba; with Aleida March (married June 2, 1959), Aleida Guevara March, born November 24, 1960 in Havana, Cuba, Camilo Guevara March, born May 20, 1962 in Havana, Cuba, Celia Guevara March, born June 14, 1963 in Havana, Cuba, and Ernesto Guevara March, born February 24, 1965 in Havana, Cuba; and with Lilia Rosa L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez (extramarital), Omar P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez, born March 19, 1964 in Havana, Cuba.101
La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a, land reform, and literacy
During the rebellion against Batista's dictatorship, the general command of the rebel army, led by Fidel Castro, introduced into the liberated territories the 19th century penal law commonly known as the Ley de la Sierra.102 This law included the death penalty for extremely serious crimes, whether perpetrated by the dictatorship or by supporters of the revolution. In 1959, the revolutionary government extended its application to the whole of the republic and to those it considered war criminals, captured and tried after the revolution. According to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, this latter extension was supported by the majority of the population, and followed the same procedure as those in the Nuremberg Trials held by the Allies after World War II.103
To implement a portion of this plan, Castro named Guevara commander of the La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a Fortress prison, for a five-month tenure (January 2 through June 12, 1959).104 Guevara was charged with purging the Batista army and consolidating victory by exacting &quot;revolutionary justice&quot; against those considered to be traitors, chivatos (informants) or war criminals.105 Serving in the post as commander of La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a, Guevara reviewed the appeals of those convicted during the revolutionary tribunal process.106 On some occasions the penalty delivered by the tribunal was death by firing squad.107 Ra&lt;U+00FA&gt;l G&lt;U+00F3&gt;mez Treto, senior legal advisor to the Cuban Ministry of Justice, has argued that the death penalty was justified in order to prevent citizens themselves from taking justice into their own hands, as happened twenty years earlier in the anti-Machado rebellion.108 Biographers note that in January 1959, the Cuban public was in a &quot;lynching mood&quot;,109 and point to a survey at the time showing 93% public approval for the tribunal process.110 With 20,000 Cubans estimated to have been killed at the hands of Batista's collaborators,111 and many of the war criminals sentenced to death accused of torture and physical atrocities,112 the newly empowered government carried out executions which biographer Jorge Casta&lt;U+00F1&gt;eda describes as &quot;without respect for due process.&quot;eda 1998 p 143-144&quot; /&gt; Although the exact numbers differ, it is estimated that several hundred people were executed nationwide during this time, with Guevara's jurisdictional death total at La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a ranging from 55 to 164.113
Conflicting views exist of Guevara's delight towards the executions at La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a. Some exiled opposition biographers report that he relished the rituals of the firing squad, and organized them with gusto, while others relate that Guevara pardoned as many prisoners as he could.114 What is acknowledged by all sides is that Guevara had become a &quot;hardened&quot; man, who had no qualms about the death penalty or summary and collective trials. If the only way to &quot;defend the revolution was to execute its enemies, he would not be swayed by humanitarian or political arguments.&quot;eda 1998 p 143-144&quot; /&gt; This is further confirmed by a February 5, 1959, letter to Luis Paredes L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez in Buenos Aires where Guevara states unequivocally &quot;The executions by firing squads are not only a necessity for the people of Cuba, but also an imposition of the people.&quot;115

Along with ensuring &quot;revolutionary justice&quot;, the other key early platform of Guevara's was establishing agrarian land reform. Almost immediately after the success of the revolution on January 27, 1959, Che Guevara made one of his most significant speeches where he talked about &quot;the social ideas of the rebel army.&quot; During this speech, he declared that the main concern of the new Cuban government was &quot;the social justice that land redistribution brings about.&quot;116 A few months later on May 17, 1959, the Agrarian Reform Law called on and crafted by Che Guevara went into effect, limiting the size of all farms to 1,000 acres. Any holdings over these limits were expropriated by the government and either redistributed to peasants in 67 acre parcels or held as state run communes.117 The law also stipulated that sugar plantations could not be owned by foreigners.118
On June 12, 1959, Castro sent Guevara out on a three-month tour of 14 countries, most of them Bandung Pact members in Africa and Asia. Sending Guevara from Havana allowed Castro to appear to be distancing himself from Che and his Marxist sympathies, that troubled both the United States and some of Castro's 26 July Movement members.119 He spent 12 days in Japan (July 15&lt;U+2013&gt;27), participating in negotiations aimed at expanding Cuba's trade relations with that nation. During this visit, Guevara secretly visited the city of Hiroshima, where the American military had detonated an atom-bomb 14 years earlier. Guevara was &quot;really shocked&quot; at what he witnessed and by his visit to a hospital where A-bomb survivors were being treated.120
Upon returning to Cuba in September 1959, it was evident that Castro now had more political power. The government had begun land seizures included in the agrarian reform law, but was hedging on compensation offers to landowners, instead offering low interest &quot;bonds&quot;, which put the U.S. on alert. At this point the affected wealthy cattlemen of Camag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ey mounted a campaign against the land redistributions, and enlisted the newly disaffected rebel leader Huber Matos, who along with the anti-Communist wing of the 26th of July Movement, joined them in denouncing the &quot;Communist encroachment.&quot;121 During this time Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo was offering assistance to the &quot;Anti-Communist Legion of the Caribbean&quot; who was training in the Dominican Republic. This multi-national force composed mostly of Spaniards and Cubans, but also of Croatians, Germans, Greeks, and right-wing mercenaries, were plotting to topple Castro's new regime.122
Such threats were heightened when on March 4, 1960, two massive explosions ripped through the French freighter La Coubre, which was carrying Belgian munitions from the port of Antwerp, and docked in Havana Harbor. The blasts killed at least 76 people and injured several hundred, with Guevara personally providing first aid to some of the victims. Cuban leader Fidel Castro immediately accused the CIA of &quot;an act of terrorism&quot; and held a state funeral the following day for the victims of the blast.123 It was at the memorial service that Alberto Korda took the famous photograph of Guevara, now known as Guerrillero Heroico.124
These perceived threats prompted Castro to further eliminate &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;, and utilize Guevara to now drastically increase the speed of land reform. To implement this plan, a new government agency the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA) was established to administer the new Agrarian Reform law, and quickly became the most important governing body in the nation with Guevara serving as its head as minister of industries.125 Under Guevara's command, INRA established its own 100,000 person militia, used first to help the government seize control of the expropriated land and supervise its distribution, and later to set up cooperative farms. The land confiscated included 480,000 acres owned by U.S. corporations.126 Months later, as retaliation, U.S President Dwight D. Eisenhower sharply reduced the import of Cuban sugar (Cuba&lt;U+2019&gt;s main cash crop), thus leading Guevara on July 10, 1960, to address over 100,000 workers in front of the Presidential Palace at a rally called to denounce U.S. &quot;economic aggression.&quot;127
Along with land reform, one of the primary areas that Guevara stressed needed national improvement was in the area of literacy. Before 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60-76 %, with educational access in rural areas and a lack of instructors the main determining factor.128 As a result, the Cuban government at Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the &quot;year of education&quot;, and sent &quot;literacy brigades&quot; out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominately illiterate Guajiros (peasants) to read and write. Unlike many of Guevara's later economic initiatives, this campaign was &quot;a remarkable success.&quot;129 By the completion of the campaign, 707,212 adults were taught to read and write, raising the national literacy rate to 96 %.130
The &quot;New Man&quot;, Bay of Pigs and Missile Crisis
Guevara then acquired the additional position of Finance Minister as President of the National Bank, which along with Minister of Industries, placed Che at the zenith of his power, as the &quot;virtual czar&quot; of the Cuban economy.131
As a consequence of his new position, it was now Guevara's duty to sign the Cuban currency, which per custom would bear his signature. However, instead of using his more dignified full name, he dismissively signed the bills solely &quot;Che.&quot;132 It was through this symbolic act, which horrified many in the Cuban financial sector, that Guevara signaled his distaste for money and the class distinctions it brought about.133 Guevara's long time friend Ricardo Rojo later remarked that &quot;the day he signed Che on the bills, (he) literally knocked the props from under the widespread belief that money was sacred.&quot;134
Meeting with French existentialist philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir in March 1960. In addition to Spanish, Guevara was fluent in French.135
Guevara's first desired economic goal, which coincided with his aversion for wealth, was to see a nation-wide elimination of material incentives in favor of moral ones. He viewed capitalism as a &quot;contest among wolves&quot; where &quot;one can only win at the cost of others,&quot; and thus desired to see the creation of a &quot;new man and woman.&quot;136 Guevara continually stressed that a socialist economy in itself is not &quot;worth the effort, sacrifice, and risks of war and destruction&quot; if it ends up encouraging &quot;greed and individual ambition at the expense collective spirit.&quot;137 A primary goal of Guevara's thus became to reform &quot;individual consciousness&quot; and values to produce better workers and citizens.138 In his view, Cuba's &quot;new man&quot; would be able to overcome the &quot;egotism&quot; and &quot;selfishness&quot; that he loathed and discerned was uniquely characteristic of individuals in capitalist societies.139 In describing this new method of &quot;development&quot;, Guevara stated: 
A further integral part of fostering a sense of &quot;unity between the individual and the mass&quot;, Guevara believed, was volunteer work and will. To display this, Guevara &quot;led by example&quot;, working &quot;endlessly at his ministry job, in construction, and even cutting sugar cane&quot; on his day off.140 He was known for working 36 hours at a stretch, calling meetings after midnight, and eating on the run.141 Such behavior was befitting of Guevara's new program of moral incentives, where each worker was now required to meet a quota and produce a certain number of goods. However, as a replacement for the pay increases abolished by Guevara, workers who now exceeded their quota only received a certificate of commendation, while workers who failed to meet their quotas were given a pay cut.142 Guevara unapologetically defended his personal philosophy towards motivation and work, stating:
Che Guevara with Heinrich Rau, East Germany's foreign trade minister, a known Spanish Civil War veteran, in December 1960
In the face of a loss of commercial connections with Western states, Guevara tried to replace them with closer commercial relationships with Eastern Bloc states, visiting a number of communist states and signing trade agreements with them. At the end of 1960 he visited Czechoslovakia, the U.S.S.R., North Korea, Hungary and East Germany and signed, for instance, a trade agreement in East Berlin on 17 December 1960.143 Such agreements helped Cuba's economy to a certain degree but had also the disadvantage of a growing economical dependency on the Eastern Bloc.
Whatever the merits or demerits of Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s economic principles, his programs soon ended in failure.144 Guevara's program of &quot;moral incentives&quot; for workers caused a rapid drop in productivity and a rapid rise in absenteeism.145 In reference to the collective failings of Guevara's vision, reporter I.F. Stone who interviewed Che twice during this time, remarked that he was &quot;Galahad not Robespierre&quot;, while opining that &quot;in a sense he was, like some early saint, taking refuge in the desert. Only there could the purity of the faith be safeguarded from the unregenerate revisionism of human nature.&quot;146
On April 17, 1961, 1,400 U.S. trained Cuban exiles invaded the island during the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Guevara himself did not play a key role in the fighting, as one day before the invasion a warship carrying Marines faked an invasion off the West Coast of Pinar Del Rio and drew forces commanded by Guevara to that region. However, historians give Guevara, who was director of instruction for Cuba&lt;U+2019&gt;s armed forces at the time, a share of credit for the victory.147 Author Tad Szulc in his explanation of the Cuban victory, assigns Guevara partial credit, stating: &quot;The revolutionaries won because Che Guevara, as the head of the Instruction Department of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in charge of the militia training program, had done so well in preparing 200,000 men and women for war.&quot;148 It was also during this deployment where he suffered a bullet grazing to the cheek when his pistol fell out of its holster and accidentally discharged.149  In August 1961, during an economic conference of the Organization of American States in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note of &quot;gratitude&quot; to U.S. President John F. Kennedy through Richard N. Goodwin, a young secretary of the White House. It read &quot;Thanks for Playa Gir&lt;U+00F3&gt;n (Bay of Pigs). Before the invasion, the revolution was shaky. Now it's stronger than ever.&quot;150 In response to U.S. Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon presenting the Alliance for Progress for ratification by the meeting, Guevara antagonistically attacked the United States claim of being a &quot;democracy&quot;, stating that such a system was not compatible with &quot;financial oligarchy, discrimination against blacks, and outrages by the Ku Klux Klan.&quot;151 Guevara continued, speaking out against the &quot;persecution&quot; that in his view &quot;drove scientists like Oppenheimer from their posts, deprived the world for years of the marvelous voice of Paul Robeson, and sent the Rosenbergs to their deaths against the protests of a shocked world.&quot;152 Guevara ended his remarks by insinuating that the United States was not interested in real reforms, sardonically quipping that &quot;U.S. experts never talk about agrarian reform; they prefer a safe subject, like a better water supply. In short they seem to prepare the revolution of the toilets.&quot;153
Guevara, who was practically the architect of the Soviet-Cuban relationship,154 then played a key role in bringing to Cuba the Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that precipitated the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.155 During an interview with the British Communist newspaper The Daily Worker a few weeks after the crisis, Guevara still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal, stated that if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.156 Sam Russell, the British correspondent who spoke to Guevara at the time came away with &quot;mixed feelings&quot;, calling him &quot;a warm character&quot; and &quot;clearly a man of great intelligence&quot;, but &quot;crackers from the way he went on about the missiles.&quot;157 The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the two World's superpowers (U.S. &amp; U.S.S.R.) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.158
International diplomacy
By December 1964, Che Guevara had emerged as a &quot;revolutionary statesman of world stature&quot; and thus traveled to New York City as head of the Cuban delegation to speak at the United Nations.159 During his impassioned address, he criticized the United Nations inability to confront the &quot;brutal policy of apartheid&quot; in South Africa, proclaiming &quot;can the United Nations do nothing to stop this?&quot;160 Guevara then denounced the United States policy towards their black population, stating: 
An indignant Guevara ended his speech by reciting the Second Declaration of Havana, decreeing Latin America a &quot;family of 200 million brothers who suffer the same miseries.&quot;161 This &quot;epic&quot;, Guevara declared, would be written by the &quot;hungry Indian masses, peasants without land, exploited workers, and progressive masses.&quot; To Guevara the conflict was a struggle of mass and ideas, which would be carried forth by those &quot;mistreated and scorned by imperialism&quot; who were previously considered &quot;a weak and submissive flock.&quot; With this &quot;flock&quot;, Guevara now asserted, &quot;Yankee monopoly capitalism&quot; now terrifyingly saw their &quot;gravediggers.&quot;162 It would be during this &quot;hour of vindication&quot; Guevara pronounced, that the &quot;anonymous mass&quot; would begin to write its own history &quot;with its own blood&quot;, and reclaim those &quot;rights that were laughed at by one and all for 500 years.&quot; Guevara ended his remarks to the United Nations general assembly by hypothesizing that this &quot;wave of anger&lt;U+201D&gt; would &quot;sweep the lands of Latin America&quot;, and that the labor masses who &quot;turn the wheel of history&quot;, for the first time were &quot;awakening from the long, brutalizing sleep to which they had been subjected.163
Guevara later learned that there were two failed attempts on his life by Cuban exiles during his stop at the U.N. complex.164 The first from Molly Gonzales who tried to break through barricades upon his arrival with a seven-inch hunting knife, and later during his address by Guillermo Novo with a timer-initiated bazooka that was fired off target from a boat in the East River at the United Nations Headquarters.165166 Afterwards, Guevara commented on both incidents stating that &quot;it is better to be killed by a woman with a knife than by a man with a gun&quot;, while adding with a languid wave of his cigar that the explosion had &quot;given the whole thing more flavor.&quot;167
Walking through Red Square in Moscow, November 1964 
While in New York City, Guevara also appeared on the CBS Sunday news program Face the Nation168 and met with a range of people, from U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy169 to associates of Malcolm X. Malcolm X expressed his admiration, declaring Guevara &quot;one of the most revolutionary men in this country right now&quot; while reading a statement from him to a crowd at the Audubon Ballroom.170
On December 17, Guevara left for Paris and embarked on a three-month tour that included the People's Republic of China, the United Arab Republic (Egypt), Algeria, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Dahomey, Congo-Brazzaville and Tanzania, with stops in Ireland and Prague. While in Ireland, Guevara embraced his own Irish heritage, celebrating Saint Patrick's Day in Limerick City.171 He wrote to his father on this visit, humorously stating &quot;I am in this green Ireland of your ancestors. When they found out, the television [station] came to ask me about the Lynch genealogy, but in case they were horse thieves or something like that, I didn't say much.&quot;172
During this voyage, he wrote a letter to Carlos Quijano, editor of a Uruguayan weekly, which was later re-titled Socialism and Man in Cuba.173 Outlined in the treatise was Guevara's summons for the creation of a new consciousness, status of work, and role of the individual. He also laid out the reasoning behind his anti-capitalist sentiments, stating:
Guevara ended the essay by declaring that &quot;the true revolutionary is guided by a great feeling of love&quot; and beckoning on all revolutionaries to &quot;strive every day so that this love of living humanity will be transformed into acts that serve as examples&quot;, thus becoming &quot;a moving force.&quot;174 The genesis for Guevara's assertions relied on the fact that he believed the example of the Cuban Revolution was &quot;something spiritual that would transcend all borders.&quot;175
In Algiers on February 24, 1965, he made what turned out to be his last public appearance on the international stage when he delivered a speech at an economic seminar on Afro-Asian solidarity.176 He specified the moral duty of the socialist countries, accusing them of tacit complicity with the exploiting Western countries. He proceeded to outline a number of measures which he said the communist-bloc countries must implement in order to accomplish the defeat of imperialism.177 Having criticized the Soviet Union (the primary financial backer of Cuba) in such a public manner, he returned to Cuba on March 14 to a solemn reception by Fidel and Ra&lt;U+00FA&gt;l Castro, Osvaldo Dortic&lt;U+00F3&gt;s and Carlos Rafael Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez at the Havana airport.
Guevara took a pro-Chinese stance on the Sino-Soviet split. In November 1960, he was received in Communist China by Chairman Mao Zedong with an official ceremony in the Government palace.
Two weeks later, in 1965 Guevara dropped out of public life and then vanished altogether. His whereabouts were a great mystery in Cuba, as he was generally regarded as second in power to Castro himself. His disappearance was variously attributed to the failure of the industrialization scheme he had advocated while minister of industry, to pressure exerted on Castro by Soviet officials disapproving of Guevara's pro-Chinese Communist stance on the Sino-Soviet split, and to serious differences between Guevara and the pragmatic Castro regarding Cuba's economic development and ideological line.
The coincidence of Guevara's views with those expounded by the Chinese Communist leadership was increasingly problematic for Cuba as the nation's economy became more and more dependent on the Soviet Union. Since the early days of the Cuban revolution, Guevara had been considered by many an advocate of Maoist strategy in Latin America and the originator of a plan for the rapid industrialization of Cuba which was frequently compared to China's &quot;Great Leap Forward.&quot; Castro became weary of Guevara's opposition to Soviet conditions and recommendations; measures that Castro saw as necessary, but which Guevara described as corrupt and &quot;pre-monopolist.&quot;178 However, both Guevara and Castro were supportive publicly on the idea of a united front.
Following the Cuban Missile Crisis and what Guevara perceived as a Soviet betrayal when Nikita Khrushchev withdrew the missiles from Cuban territory, Guevara had grown more skeptical of the Soviet Union. As revealed in his last speech in Algiers, he had come to view the Northern Hemisphere, led by the U.S. in the West and the Soviet Union in the East, as the exploiter of the Southern Hemisphere. He strongly supported Communist North Vietnam in the Vietnam War, and urged the peoples of other developing countries to take up arms and create &quot;many Vietnams.&quot;179
Pressed by international speculation regarding Guevara's fate, Castro stated on June 16, 1965 that the people would be informed when Guevara himself wished to let them know. Still, rumors spread both inside and outside Cuba. On October 3, Castro revealed an undated letter purportedly written to him by Guevara some months earlier: in it, Guevara reaffirmed his enduring solidarity with the Cuban Revolution, but declared his intention to leave Cuba to fight for the revolutionary cause abroad. Additionally, he resigned from all his positions in the government and party, and renounced his honorary Cuban citizenship.180 Guevara's movements continued to be a closely guarded secret for the next two years.
Congo
A 37-year-old Guevara, in the Congo Crisis, 1965.
In 1965, Guevara decided to venture to Africa and offer his knowledge and experience as a guerrilla to the ongoing conflict in the Congo. According to Algerian President Ahmed Ben Bella, Guevara thought that Africa was imperialism's weak link and therefore had enormous revolutionary potential.181 Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had fraternal relations with Che dating back to his 1959 visit, saw Guevara's plans to fight in the Congo as &quot;unwise&quot; and warned that he would become a &quot;Tarzan&quot; figure, doomed to failure.182 Despite the warning, Guevara traveled to the Congo while using the alias Ram&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez.183 Guevara led the Cuban operation in support of the Marxist Simba movement, which had emerged from the ongoing Congo Crisis. Guevara, his second-in-command Victor Dreke, and 12 other Cuban expeditionaries arrived in the Congo on April 24, 1965 and a contingent of approximately 100 Afro-Cubans joined them soon afterward.184185 They collaborated for a time with guerrilla leader Laurent-D&lt;U+00E9&gt;sir&lt;U+00E9&gt; Kabila, who had previously helped supporters of the CIA-slain Patrice Lumumba lead an unsuccessful revolt months earlier. As an admirer of the late Lumumba, Guevara declared that his &quot;murder should be a lesson for all of us.&quot;186 Guevara, with limited knowledge of Swahili and the local languages was assigned a teenage interpreter Freddy Ilanga. Over the course of seven months Ilanga grew to &quot;admire the hard-working Guevara&quot;, who according to Mr. Ilanga, &quot;showed the same respect to black people as he did to whites.&quot;187 However Guevara soon became disillusioned with the discipline of Kabila's troops and later dismissed him, stating &quot;nothing leads me to believe he is the man of the hour.&quot;188
As an additional obstacle, white South African mercenaries, led by Mike Hoare in concert with Cuban exiles and the CIA, worked with the Congo National Army to thwart Guevara in the mountains near the village of Fizi on Lake Tanganyika. They were able to monitor his communications, and so pre-empted his attacks and interdicted his supply lines. Despite the fact that Guevara sought to conceal his presence in the Congo, the U.S. government was aware of his location and activities: The National Security Agency was intercepting all of his incoming and outgoing transmissions via equipment aboard the USNS Pvt Jose F. Valdez (T-AG-169), a floating listening post that continuously cruised the Indian Ocean off Dar es Salaam for that purpose.189
Listening to a Zenith Trans-Oceanic shortwave receiver are (seated from the left) Rogelio Oliva, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez Tamayo (known as &quot;Mbili&quot; in the Congo and &quot;Ricardo&quot; in Bolivia), and Guevara. Standing behind them is Roberto S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez (&quot;Lawton&quot; in Cuba and &quot;Changa&quot; in the Congo).
Guevara's aim was to export the revolution by instructing local anti-Mobutu Simba fighters in Marxist ideology and foco theory strategies of guerrilla warfare. In his Congo Diary, he cites the incompetence, intransigence and infighting of the local Congolese forces as key reasons for the revolt's failure.190 Later that year, ill with dysentery, suffering from acute asthma, and disheartened after seven months of frustrations, Guevara left the Congo with the Cuban survivors (Six members of his column had died). At one point Guevara considered sending the wounded back to Cuba, and fighting in Congo alone until his death, as a revolutionary example; however, after being urged by his comrades and pressed by two emissaries sent by Castro, at the last moment he reluctantly agreed to retreat. In speaking about the Congo, Guevara concluded that &quot;The human element failed. There is no will to fight, the leaders are corrupt; in a word, there was nothing to do.&quot;191 A few weeks later, when writing the preface to the diary he kept during the Congo venture, he began: &quot;This is the history of a failure.&quot;192
Guevara was reluctant to return to Cuba, because Castro had made public Guevara's &quot;farewell letter&quot; &lt;U+2014&gt; a letter intended to only be revealed in the case of his death &lt;U+2014&gt; wherein he severed all ties in order to devote himself to revolution throughout the world.193 As a result, Guevara spent the next six months living clandestinely in Dar es Salaam and Prague.194 During this time he compiled his memoirs of the Congo experience, and wrote drafts of two more books, one on philosophy and the other on economics. He then visited several Western European countries to test his new false identity papers, created by Cuban Intelligence for his later travels to South America. As Guevara prepared for Bolivia, he wrote a last letter to his five children to be read upon his death, which ended with him instructing them: 
Bolivia
Guevara in disguise, while using the alias Adolfo Mena Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez (1966)
In late 1966, Guevara's location was still not public knowledge, although representatives of Mozambique's independence movement, the FRELIMO, reported that they met with Guevara in late 1966 or early 1967 in Dar es Salaam regarding his offer to aid in their revolutionary project, which they ultimately rejected.195 In a speech at the 1967 International Workers' Day rally in Havana, the Acting Minister of the armed forces, Major Juan Almeida, announced that Guevara was &quot;serving the revolution somewhere in Latin America&quot;.
Before he departed for Bolivia, Guevara altered his appearance so he would be unrecognizable as Che Guevara.196 In November, 1966, Guevara secretly arrived in La Paz, Bolivia on a flight from Montevideo, Uruguay under the false name Adolfo Mena Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez, and posed as a Uruguayan businessman working for the Organization of American States.197
In rural Bolivia shortly before his death (1967)
Guevara's first base camp was located in the montane dry forest in the remote &lt;U+00D1&gt;ancahuaz&lt;U+00FA&gt; region. Training at the camp in the &lt;U+00D1&gt;ancahuaz&lt;U+00FA&gt; valley however proved to be hazardous and little was accomplished in the way of building a guerrilla army. Former Stasi operative Hayd&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Tamara Bunke Bider, better known by her nom de guerre &quot;Tania&quot;, who had been installed as his primary agent in La Paz, was reportedly also working for the KGB and in several Western sources she is inferred to have unwittingly served Soviet interests by leading Bolivian authorities to Guevara's trail.198199
Guevara's guerrilla force, numbering about 50200 and operating as the ELN (Ej&lt;U+00E9&gt;rcito de Liberaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Nacional de Bolivia; &quot;National Liberation Army of Bolivia&quot;), was well equipped and scored a number of early successes against Bolivian army regulars in the difficult terrain of the mountainous Camiri region. As a result of Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s units winning several skirmishes against Bolivian troops in the spring and summer of 1967, the Bolivian government began to overestimate the true size of the guerrilla force.201 But in September, the Army managed to eliminate two guerrilla groups in a violent battle, reportedly killing one of the leaders.
Location of Vallegrande in Bolivia
Researchers hypothesize that Guevara's plan for fomenting revolution in Bolivia failed, for an array of reasons:
He had expected to deal only with the Bolivian military, who were poorly trained and equipped. However, Guevara was unaware that the U.S. government had sent a team of the CIA's Special Activities Division commandos and other operatives into Bolivia to aid the anti-insurrection effort. The Bolivian Army would also be trained, advised, and supplied by U.S. Army Special Forces including a recently organized elite battalion of Rangers trained in jungle warfare that set up camp in La Esperanza, a small settlement close to the location of Guevara's guerrillas.202
Guevara had expected assistance and cooperation from the local dissidents which he did not receive, nor did he receive support from Bolivia's Communist Party, under the leadership of Mario Monje, which was oriented toward Moscow rather than Havana. In Guevara's own diary captured after his death, he bristled with complaints about the Communist Party of Bolivia, which he characterized as &quot;distrustful, disloyal and stupid.&quot;203
He had expected to remain in radio contact with Havana. However, the two shortwave transmitters provided to him by Cuba were faulty; thus the guerrillas were unable to communicate with and be resupplied, leaving them isolated and stranded.
In addition, Guevara's known preference for confrontation rather than compromise, which had previously surfaced during his guerrilla warfare campaign in Cuba, contributed to his inability to develop successful working relationships with local leaders in Bolivia, just as it had in the Congo.204 This tendency had existed in Cuba, but had been kept in check by the timely interventions and guidance of Fidel Castro.205
The end result was that Guevara was unable to attract inhabitants of the local area to join his militia during the 11 months he attempted recruitment. Near the end of the venture Guevara complained in his diary that &quot;the peasants do not give us any help, and are turning into informers.&quot;206
Capture and execution
F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez, a Cuban exile turned CIA Special Activities Division operative, advised Bolivian troops during the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia.207 In addition, the 2007 documentary My Enemy's Enemy, directed by Kevin Macdonald, alleges that Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie aka &quot;The Butcher of Lyon&quot;, advised and possibly helped the CIA orchestrate Guevara's eventual capture.208
On October 7, an informant apprised the Bolivian Special Forces of the location of Guevara's guerrilla encampment in the Yuro ravine. They encircled the area with 1,800 soldiers, and Guevara was wounded and taken prisoner while leading a detachment with Sime&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Cuba Sarabia. Che biographer Jon Lee Anderson reports Bolivian Sergeant Bernardino Huanca's account: that a twice wounded Guevara, his gun rendered useless, shouted &quot;Do not shoot! I am Che Guevara and worth more to you alive than dead.&quot;209
Guevara was tied up and taken to a dilapidated mud schoolhouse in the nearby village of La Higuera on the night of October 7. For the next day-and-a-half, Guevara refused to be interrogated by Bolivian officers and would only speak quietly to Bolivian soldiers. One of those Bolivian soldiers, helicopter pilot Jaime Nino de Guzman, describes Che as looking &quot;dreadful&quot;. According to Guzman, Guevara was shot through the right calf, his hair was matted with dirt, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were covered in rough leather sheaths. Despite his haggard appearance, he recounts that &quot;Che held his head high, looked everyone straight in the eyes and asked only for something to smoke.&quot; De Guzman states that he &quot;took pity&quot; and gave him a small bag of tobacco for his pipe, with Guevara then smiling and thanking him.210 Later on the night of October 8, Guevara, despite having his hands tied, kicked Bolivian Officer Espinosa into the wall, after the officer entered the schoolhouse in order to snatch Guevara's pipe from his mouth as a souvenir.211 In another instance of defiance, Guevara spat in the face of Bolivian Rear Admiral Ugarteche shortly before his execution.le&quot; /&gt;
The following morning on October 9, Guevara asked to see the &quot;maestra&quot; (school teacher) of the village, 22-year-old Julia Cortez. Cortez would later state that she found Guevara to be an &quot;agreeable looking man with a soft and ironic glance&quot; and that during their conversation she found herself &quot;unable to look him in the eye&quot;, because his &quot;gaze was unbearable, piercing, and so tranquil.&quot;le&quot; /&gt; During their short conversation, Guevara complained to Cortez about the poor condition of the schoolhouse, stating that it was &quot;anti-pedagogical&quot; to expect campesino students to be educated there, while &quot;government officials drive Mercedes cars&quot; ... declaring &quot;that's what we are fighting against.&quot;le&quot; /&gt;
Later that morning on October 9, Bolivian President Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Barrientos ordered that Guevara be killed. The order was relayed by F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez despite the US government&lt;U+2019&gt;s desire that Guevara be taken to Panama.212. The executioner was Mario Ter&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, a half-drunken sergeant in the Bolivian army who had requested to shoot Che on the basis of the fact that three of his friends from B Company, all named &quot;Mario&quot;, had been killed in an earlier firefight with Guevara's band of guerrillas.213 To make the bullet wounds appear consistent with the story the government planned to release to the public, F&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez ordered Ter&lt;U+00E1&gt;n to aim carefully to make it appear that Guevara had been killed in action during a clash with the Bolivian army.214 Gary Prado, a Bolivian soldier who was with the group that captured Guevara, said that the reasons Barrientos ordered the immediate execution of Guevara is so there would be no possibility that Guevara would escape from prison, and also so there would be no drama in regard to a trial.215
Moments before Guevara was executed he was asked if he was thinking about his own immortality. &quot;No&quot;, he replied, &quot;I'm thinking about the immortality of the revolution.&quot;216 When Sergeant Ter&lt;U+00E1&gt;n entered the hut, Che Guevara then told his executioner, &quot;I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward! You are only going to kill a man!&quot;217 Ter&lt;U+00E1&gt;n hesitated, then opened fire with his semiautomatic rifle, hitting Guevara in the arms and legs. Guevara writhed on the ground, apparently biting one of his wrists to avoid crying out. Ter&lt;U+00E1&gt;n then fired several times again, wounding him fatally in the chest at 1:10 pm, according to Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez.218 In all, Guevara was shot nine times. This included five times in the legs, once in the right shoulder and arm, once in the chest, and finally in the throat.le&quot; /&gt;
Months earlier, during his last public declaration to the Tricontinental Conference,219 Guevara wrote his own epitaph, stating &quot;Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome, provided that this our battle cry may have reached some receptive ear and another hand may be extended to wield our weapons.&quot;220
Post-execution, remains and memorial

After his execution, Guevara's body was lashed to the landing skids of a helicopter and flown to nearby Vallegrande, where photographs were taken of him lying on a concrete slab in the laundry room of the Nuestra Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;ora de Malta.221 As hundreds of local residents filed past the body, many of them considered Guevara's corpse to represent a &quot;Christ-like&quot; visage, with some of them even surreptitiously clipping locks of his hair as divine relics.222 Such comparisons were further extended when two weeks later upon seeing the post-mortem photographs, English art critic John Berger observed that they resembled two famous paintings: Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp and Andrea Mantegna's Lamentation over the Dead Christ.223 There were also four correspondents present when Guevara's body arrived in Vallegrande, including Bjorn Kumm of the Swedish Aftonbladet, who described the scene in an November 11, 1967, exclusive for The New Republic.224

Johnson from his National Security Advisor, Walt Whitman Rostow, called the decision to kill Guevara &quot;stupid&quot; but &quot;understandable from a Bolivian standpoint.&quot;225 After the execution, Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez took several of Guevara's personal items, including a Rolex GMT Master wristwatch226 which he continued to wear many years later, often showing them to reporters during the ensuing years.227 Today, some of these belongings, including his flashlight, are on display at the CIA.228 After a military doctor amputated his hands, Bolivian army officers transferred Guevara's body to an undisclosed location and refused to reveal whether his remains had been buried or cremated. The hands were preserved in formaldehyde to be sent to Buenos Aires for fingerprint identification. (His fingerprints were on file with the Argentine police.) They were later sent to Cuba.
Plaza de la Revoluci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, in Havana, Cuba. Aside the Ministry of the Interior building where Guevara once worked, is a 5 story steel outline of his face. Under the image is Guevara's motto, the Spanish phrase: &quot;Hasta la Victoria Siempre&quot; (English: Until the Everlasting Victory Always).
On October 15, Fidel Castro acknowledged that Guevara was dead and proclaimed three days of public mourning throughout the island.229 On October 18, Castro addressed a crowd of one million mourners in Havana's Plaza de la Revoluci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n and spoke about Guevara's character as a revolutionary.230 Fidel Castro closed his impassioned eulogy thusly: 
French intellectual R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gis Debray, who was captured in April 1967 while with Guevara in Bolivia, gave an interview from prison, in August 1968, where he enlarged on the circumstances of Guevara's capture. Debray, who had lived with Guevara's band of guerrillas for a short time, said that in his view they were &quot;victims of the forest&quot; and thus &quot;eaten by the jungle.&quot;231 Debray described a destitute situation where Guevara's men suffered malnutrition, lack of water, absence of shoes, and only possessed six blankets for 22 men. Debray recounts that Guevara and the others had been suffering an &quot;illness&quot; which caused their hands and feet to swell into &quot;mounds of flesh&quot; to the point where you could not discern the fingers on their hands.232 Despite the futile situation, Debray described Guevara as &quot;optimistic about the future of Latin America&quot; and remarked that Guevara was &quot;resigned to die in the knowledge that his death would be a sort of renaissance&quot;, noting that Guevara perceived death &quot;as a promise of rebirth&quot; and &quot;ritual of renewal.&quot;233
In late 1995, retired Bolivian General Mario Vargas revealed to Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, that Guevara's body was located near a Vallegrande airstrip. The result was a multi-national search for the remains, which would last more than a year. In July 1997, a team of Cuban geologists and Argentine forensic anthropologists discovered the remnants of seven bodies in two mass graves, including one man with amputated hands (like Guevara). Bolivian government officials with the Ministry of Interior later identified the body as Guevara when the excavated teeth &quot;perfectly matched&quot; a plaster mold of Che's teeth, made in Cuba prior to his Congolese expedition. The &quot;clincher&quot; then arrived when Argentine forensic anthropologist Alejandro Inchaurregui inspected the inside hidden pocket of a blue jacket dug up next to the handless cadaver and found a small bag of pipe tobacco. Nino de Guzman, the Bolivian helicopter pilot who had given Che a small bag of tobacco, later remarked that he &quot;had serious doubts&quot; at first and &quot;thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che&quot;; however he stated &quot;after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts.&quot;234 On October 17, 1997, Guevara's remains, with those of six of his fellow combatants, were laid to rest with military honors in a specially built mausoleum in the Cuban city of Santa Clara, where he had commanded over the decisive military victory of the Cuban Revolution.235

Removed when Guevara was captured was his 30,000-word, hand-written diary, a collection of his personal poetry, and a short story he authored about a young Communist guerrilla who learns to overcome his fears.236 His diary documented events of the guerrilla campaign in Bolivia237 with the first entry on November 7, 1966 shortly after his arrival at the farm in &lt;U+00D1&gt;ancahuaz&lt;U+00FA&gt;, and the last dated October 7, 1967, the day before his capture. The diary tells how the guerrillas were forced to begin operations prematurely because of discovery by the Bolivian Army, explains Guevara's decision to divide the column into two units that were subsequently unable to re-establish contact, and describes their overall unsuccessful venture. It also records the rift between Guevara and the Communist Party of Bolivia that resulted in Guevara having significantly fewer soldiers than originally expected and shows that Guevara had a great deal of difficulty recruiting from the local populace, partly because of the fact that the guerrilla group had learned Quechua, unaware that the local language was actually Tup&lt;U+00ED&gt;-Guaran&lt;U+00ED&gt;.238 As the campaign drew to an unexpected close, Guevara became increasingly ill. He suffered from ever-worsening bouts of asthma, and most of his last offensives were carried out in an attempt to obtain medicine.239
The Bolivian Diary was quickly and crudely translated by Ramparts magazine and circulated around the world.240 There are at least four additional diaries in existence&lt;U+2014&gt;those of Israel Reyes Zayas (Alias &quot;Braulio&quot;), Harry Villegas Tamayo (&quot;Pombo&quot;), Eliseo Reyes Rodriguez (&quot;Rolando&quot;)241 and Dariel Alarc&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez (&quot;Benigno&quot;)242&lt;U+2014&gt;each of which reveals additional aspects of the events. In July 2008, the Bolivian government of Evo Morales unveiled Guevara's formerly sealed diaries composed in two frayed notebooks, along with a logbook and several black-and-white photographs. At this event, Bolivia's vice minister of culture, Pablo Groux, expressed that there were plans to publish photographs of every handwritten page later in the year.243 Meanwhile, in August 2009, anthropologists working for Bolivia's Justice Ministry discovered and unearthed five of Guevara's fellow guerrillas near the Bolivian town of Teoponte.244
Legacy

Over forty years after his execution, Che's life and legacy still remain a contentious issue. The contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of unending duality.
As a result of his perceived martyrdom, poetic invocations for class struggle, and desire to create the consciousness of a new man driven by moral rather than material incentives,245 Guevara evolved into a quintessential icon of leftist-inspired movements. An array of notable individuals have viewed Che Guevara as a hero;246 for example, Nelson Mandela referred to him as &quot;an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom&quot;247 while Jean-Paul Sartre described him as &quot;not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age.&quot;248 Others who expressed their admiration include authors Graham Greene who remarked that Che &quot;represented the idea of gallantry, chivalry, and adventure&quot;,249 and Susan Sontag who expounded that &quot;(Che's) goal was nothing less than the cause of humanity itself.&quot;250 In the black community, philosopher Frantz Fanon professed Guevara to be &quot;the world symbol of the possibilities of one man&quot;,251 while Black Panther Party head Stokely Carmichael eulogized that &quot;Che Guevara is not dead, his ideas are with us.&quot;252 Praise has been reflected throughout the political spectrum, with the anarcho-capitalist / libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard extolling Guevara as a &quot;heroic figure&quot;, lamenting after his death that &quot;more than any man of our epoch or even of our century, (Che) was the living embodiment of the principle of revolution&quot;,253 while journalist Christopher Hitchens commented that &quot;[Che's] death meant a lot to me and countless like me at the time, he was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do &lt;U+2014&gt; fought and died for his beliefs.&quot;254 Guevara remains a beloved national hero to many in Cuba, where his image adorns the $3 Cuban Peso and school children begin each morning by pledging &quot;We will be like Che.&quot;255 In his native homeland of Argentina, where high schools bear his name,256 numerous Che museums dot the country, which in 2008 unveiled a 12 foot bronze statue of him in his birth city of Rosario.257 Additionally, Guevara has been sanctified by some Bolivian campesinos258 as &quot;Saint Ernesto&quot;, to whom they pray for assistance.259 
Conversely, Jacobo Machover, an exiled opposition author, dismisses the hero-worshipping and portrays him as a ruthless executioner.260 Detractors have theorized that in much of Latin America, Che-inspired revolutions had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism and internecine conflict for many years.261 In an assessment of Guevara, British historian Hugh Thomas opines that Che was a &quot;brave, sincere and determined man who was also obstinate, narrow, and dogmatic.&quot;262 At the end of his life, according to Thomas, &quot;he seems to have become convinced of the virtues of violence for its own sake&quot;, while &quot;his influence over Castro for good or evil&quot; grew after his death, as Fidel took up many of his views. In Thomas' assessment &quot;as in the case of Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;, or Lawrence of Arabia, failure has brightened, not dimmed the legend.&quot;263 Alvaro Vargas Llosa of The Independent Institute has hypothesized that Guevara&lt;U+2019&gt;s contemporary followers &quot;delude themselves by clinging to a myth&quot;, while describing Guevara as &quot;Marxist Puritan&quot; who employed his rigid power to suppress dissent, while also operating as a &quot;cold-blooded killing machine&quot;.264 Llosa has also accused Guevara's &quot;fanatical disposition&quot; as being the linchpin of the &quot;Sovietization&quot; of the Cuban revolution, speculating that he possessed a &quot;total subordination of reality to blind ideological orthodoxy.&quot;265 Guevara remains a hated figure amongst many in the Cuban exile and Cuban-American community of the United States, who view him with animosity as &quot;the butcher of La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a.&quot;266
Despite his polarized status, a high-contrast monochrome graphic of his face has become one of the world's most universally merchandized and objectified images,267268 found on an endless array of items, including t-shirts, hats, posters, tattoos, and bikinis,269 ironically contributing to the consumer culture he despised. Yet, Guevara still remains a transcendent figure both in specifically political contexts270 and as a wide-ranging popular icon of youthful rebellion.271

The date of birth recorded on his birth certificate was June 14, 1928, although one tertiary source, (Julia Constenla, quoted by Jon Lee Anderson), asserts that he was actually born on May 14 of that year. Constenla alleges that she was told by an unidentified astrologer that his mother, Celia de la Serna, was already pregnant when she and Ernesto Guevara Lynch were married and that the date on the birth certificate of their son was forged to make it appear that he was born a month later than the actual date to avoid scandal.

A copy of Guevara's University transcripts showing conferral of his medical diploma can be found on p. 75 of Becoming Che: Guevara's Second and Final Trip through Latin America, by Carlos 'Calica' Ferrer (Translated from the Spanish by Sarah L. Smith), Marea Editorial, 2006, ISBN 987-1307-07-1. Ferrer was a longtime childhood friend of Che, and when Guevara passed the last of his 12 exams in 1953, he gave him a copy to prove to Ferrer, who had been telling Guevara that he would never finish, that he had finally completed his studies.↩

Different sources cite differing numbers of executions, with some of the discrepancy resulting from which deaths to attribute directly to Guevara or to the regime as a whole. Anderson (1997) gives the number specifically at La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a prison as 55 (p. 387.), while also stating that as a whole &quot;several hundred people were officially tried and executed across Cuba&quot; (p. 387). (Casta&lt;U+00F1&gt;eda 1998) notes how historians differ on the number killed and place it as anywhere from 200-700 nationwide (p. 143), although he notes that &quot;after a certain date most of the executions occurred outside of Che's jurisdiction&quot; (p. 143). These numbers are supported by Armando Lago and the opposition-based Free Society Project / Cuba Archive, which gives the figure as 216 executions ordered by Guevara across Cuba in three years (1957-1960) and 164 &quot;victims&quot; specifically at La Caba&lt;U+00F1&gt;a, which were according to Lago, &quot;all carried out without affording the victims due process of law.&quot;↩
