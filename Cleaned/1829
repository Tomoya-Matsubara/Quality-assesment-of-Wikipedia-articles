The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 was a single-seat, twin-engined prototype fighter aircraft designed for the United States Air Force. It was a finalist in the United States Air Force's USAF Advanced Tactical Fighter competition.  Two YF-23s were built, nicknamed Black Widow II and Gray Ghost.  The YF-23 competed against the Lockheed YF-22 YF-22 for a USAF production contract.  
In the 1980s, the USAF began looking for a replacement for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the advanced Sukhoi Su-27 Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. The Lockheed Corporation Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics camp entered the YF-22. The Northrop Corporation Northrop/McDonnell Douglas group promoted the larger YF-23. This aircraft, using some existing components from the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle F-15 Eagle and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet F/A-18 Hornet, was stealthier and faster but less agile than its YF-22 counterpart.  After an evaluation process, the YF-22 was announced the winner in 1991 and would later enter production as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.  Both YF-23s are now museum exhibits.
 Design and development 
In 1981, the U.S. Air Force began forming a requirement for an Advanced Tactical Fighter ATF as a new air superiority fighter to replace the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle F-15 Eagle.Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;1213. The need for a more advanced aircraft was emphasized by the discovery of new advanced Soviet Sukhoi Su-27 Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 MiG-29 fighters.Miller 2005, p.&nbsp;10.  The ATF would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on the horizon including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and stealth technology.http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=2382 Fact sheet: Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics YF-22. NationalMuseum.af.mil, 11 February 2009. Retrieved: 18 June 2011. In 1985 the Air Force sent out technical requests for proposals to a number of aircraft manufacturing teams. A request for proposal RFP was issued in July 1986, and two contractor teams, Lockheed Corporation Lockheed/Boeing/General Dynamics and Northrop/McDonnell Douglas were selected on 31&nbsp;October&nbsp;1986 to undertake a 50-month demonstration phase, culminating in the flight test of two prototypes, the YF-22 and the YF-23.Jenkins and Landis, pp.&nbsp;233234.Williams 2002, pp.&nbsp;56.Winchester 2005, pp.&nbsp;198199.
The YF-23 was designed to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%203004.html ATF procurement launches new era. Flight International, 15 November 1986. Retrieved: 25 June 2011. Designed with all-aspect stealth as a high priority, Northrop drew on the company's experience with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit B-2 Spirit and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet F/A-18 Hornet. The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft with trapezoidal wings, substantial area rule area-ruling, and a V-tail.  Similar to the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat ablating tiles, to shield the exhaust from infrared IR missile detection from below.Sweetman 1991, p.&nbsp;44.  The vehicle management system coordinated movements of the control surfaces for maneuvers and for stable flight, along with other aircraft functions.Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;3435. The wing flaps and ailerons deflected inversely on either side to provide roll. Pitch was provided by moving both V-tails in the same direction, and yaw was supplied by opposite movement. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking.Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;4345.
Although the YF-23 featured an advanced design, in order to reduce development costs and time a number of components from existing designs were used, including the standard F-15 nose wheel unit, some F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit of the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle F-15E Strike Eagle.Jenkins and Landis, p.&nbsp;237. Two aircraft were built. YF-23 #1 PAV-1 was fitted with Pratt & Whitney F119 Pratt & Whitney YF119 engines, while YF-23 #2 PAV-2 was fitted with General Electric YF120 engines. The YF-23 featured fixed nozzles.  The YF-23s were completed in the configuration specified before the requirement for thrust reversing was dropped.Miller 2005, p.&nbsp;23.Sweetman 1991, pp.&nbsp;23, 43.
The first YF-23 United States military aircraft serials serial number 87-0800, N231YF, the gray-painted Gray Ghost, was rolled out on 22&nbsp;June&nbsp;1990.Pace 1999, chapter 5.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%201803.html YF-23 roll out marks ATF debut.

It then took its 50-minute maiden flight on 27&nbsp;August with Alfred Paul Metz at the controls.Bailey, John. http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%202544.html YF-22 ATF prototype set for maiden flight. Flight International, 511 September 1990. Retrieved: 23 June 2011.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1990/1990%20-%203086.html YF-22 flies as ATFs head for deadline. Flight International, 1016 October 1990. Retrieved: 24 June 2011.Goodall 1992, p.&nbsp;99.  The black YF-23 s/n 87-0801, N232YF was nicknamed Spider and Black Widow II&mdash; the latter after the Northrop P-61 Black Widow of World War II&mdash;and had a red hourglass marking resembling the underbelly marking of the black widow spider. The black widow marking was briefly seen under PAV-1 before Northrop management had it removed.Goodall 1992, p.&nbsp;120. This aircraft made its first flight on 26&nbsp;October, piloted by Jim Sandberg.
 Operational history 
 Evaluation 
The YF-23's weapons bay was configured for weapons launch but no missiles were fired, unlike Lockheed's demonstration aircraft.Miller 2005, p. 39. The first YF-23 with Pratt & Whitney engines supercruised at Mach&nbsp;1.43 on 18 September 1990 and the second YF-23 with General Electric engines reached Mach&nbsp;1.6 on 29 November 1990. By comparison, the YF-22 achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise.Goodall 1992, pp.&nbsp;102103.  The flight testing demonstrated Northrop's predicted performance values for the YF-23.  Flight testing continued into December 1990.  The prototypes flew 50 times for a total of 65.2 hours.Norris, Guy. http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1991/1991%20-%201440.html NASA could rescue redundant YF-23s. Flight International, 511 June 1991. Retrieved: 25 June 2011.  After testing the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production.Miller 2005, pp.&nbsp;38-39.
On 23&nbsp;April&nbsp;1991, the YF-22 was announced by United States Secretary of the Air Force Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice as the winner of the ATF competition.Jenkins and Landis, p.&nbsp;234. The YF-23 design was more stealthy and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile.Goodall 1992, p.&nbsp;110. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter NATF, but by 1992 the US Navy had abandoned NATF.Miller 2005, p. 76.Williams 2002, p. 6.  Following the competition, both YF-23s were transferred to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, at Edwards Air Force Base Edwards AFB, California, without their engines.  NASA planned to use one of the aircraft to study strain gauge loads calibration techniques, but this did not eventuate.http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/YF-23/index.html YF-23 page.

 Possible revival 
In late 2004, Northrop Grumman proposed a YF-23-based design for the USAF's interim bomber requirement, a role for which the Lockheed Martin FB-22 FB-22 and B-1 Lancer#B-1R B-1R are also competing.Hebert, Adam J. http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2004/November%202004/1104strike.aspx Long-Range Strike in a Hurry. Air Force magazine, November 2004. Retrieved: 24 June 2011.  Aircraft PAV-2 was modified by Northrop as a full-size model of its proposed interim bomber. The interim bomber requirement has since been canceled in favor of a more Next-Generation Bomber long-term, bomber replacement requirement, although the same YF-23-derived design could be adapted to fulfill this role as well.http://www.physorg.com/news73195391.html New Long-Range Bomber On Horizon For 2018. physorg.com, 26 July 2006. Retrieved: 26 June 2011.  However, the possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber appeared ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, in favor of a long-range bomber with a much greater range.http://www.defenselink.mil/qdr/report/Report20060203.pdf Quadrennial Defense Review Report.

Aircraft on display
Both YF-23 airframes remained in storage until mid-1996, when the aircraft were transferred to museums.
YF-23A PAV-1, s/n 87-0800, is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The aircraft was recently put on display following restoration and is located in the Museum's Research and Development hangar.http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7152 YF-23 fact sheet with restoration status, http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/photos/media_search.asp?q=YF-23&btnG.x=0&btnG.y=0 YF-23 images.
