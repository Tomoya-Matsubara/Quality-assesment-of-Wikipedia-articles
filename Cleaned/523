Fever is the eighth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, released on 1 October 2001 in Australia and the United Kingdom by Parlophone. The album was later released in the United States on 26 February 2002 and was Minogue's first album release in the region since her second studio album Enjoy Yourself (1989). Minogue worked with writers and producers such as Cathy Dennis, Rob Davis, Richard Stannard, Julian Gallagher, TommyD, Tom Nichols, Pascal Gabriel and others to create the disco and Europop-influenced dance-pop album. Other musical influences of the album range from synthpop to club music.
Four singles were released from the album. Its lead single &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; was released in September 2001 and became a massive commercial success, peaking atop the charts of 40 countries and selling more than five million copies worldwide. The song, which is often recognised as Minogue's signature song, is her highest selling single as of today and one of the best-selling singles of all time. Follow-up singles &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; also performed well on charts internationally. The last single &quot;Come into My World&quot; won Minogue a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2004, and stands as her only Grammy Award-winning song till date. All four singles charted within the top 10 in Australia and the United Kingdom, with &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; peaking at number one in both countries. In order to promote the album, Minogue embarked on the KylieFever2002 tour.
Upon its release, Fever received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised its production and commercial nature. Likewise, the album was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the charts of countries like Australia, Austria, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the album peaked at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart, becoming Minogue's biggest hit in the country. The album was certified seven-times platinum in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), five-times platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Australia, Fever was the thirteenth best selling album of the decade. Fever has sold over six million copies worldwide and is Minogue's highest selling album.
Background and production
In 1998, Minogue was dropped from her label Deconstruction following the poor commercial performance of her sixth studio album Impossible Princess.1 She instead signed on to Parlophone and released her seventh studio album Light Years.2 The disco and Europop inspired album was a critical and commercial success,3 and was later certified four times-platinum in Minogue's native country Australia for shipment of 280,000 units,4 and platinum in the United Kingdom for shipment of 300,000 units.5 &quot;Spinning Around&quot; was released as the lead single off the album and was a commercial success, attaining a platinum certification in Australia for shipment of 70,000 units,6 and a silver certification in the United Kingdom for shipment of 200,000 units.7 She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour.
Soon after, Minogue began work on her eighth studio album Fever. On the album, she collaborated with producers and writers such as British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis, who co-wrote two songs out of the three she co-produced, Rob Davis, who co-produced and co-wrote three songs, and Richard Stannard and Julian Gallagher, who co-produced and co-wrote three songs.89 In the vein of Light Years, Fever is a disco and dancepop album that contains elements of adult contemporary and club music.1011 The recording of the album took place at studios such as the Biffco Studios in Dublin, Hutch Studios in Chicago, Olympic Studios in London and Stella Studios.12
Musical styles and lyrical content
Fever is primarily a dance-pop album, with prominent elements of 1970s-influenced disco and Europop.131415 Jacqueline Hodges from BBC Music wrote that the album is not &quot;pure pop&quot;, and is rather characterized by a more adventurous dance-oriented sound.16 NME critic Alex Needham identified a &quot;filter disco effect&quot;, described as &quot;the one that sounds like you've gone under water and then ecstatically come up for air,&quot; working on various songs on the album.17 Needham saw Fever as an &quot;update&quot; from the &quot;frothy disco&quot; of Light Years.18 Songs like the opening track &quot;More More More&quot; and closing track &quot;Burning Up&quot; are examples of the disco-influenced production of the album. The former is an uptempo song with a &quot;funky&quot; bassline,19 while the latter was described as a &quot;slow burn&quot; disco song.20 Teen pop elements appear on songs like &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, which begins with an electric piano intro,2122 and the &quot;aggressive&quot; &quot;Give It to Me&quot;.232425 The lead single &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is a &quot;robotic&quot; midtempo dance and nu-disco song.2627 Many critics felt that various songs on the album, particularly &quot;Come into My World&quot;, are similar to &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;.2829 The title track and &quot;Dancefloor&quot; draw influences from synthpop and club music, respectively.303132 &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; contains hints of trance and house music.33 Minor influences of ambient music surface on the &quot;atmospheric&quot; &quot;Fragile&quot;.34 Minogue's vocal delivery ranges from &quot;sensuous&quot; (in &quot;More More More&quot;) to &quot;sweet&quot; (in &quot;Your Love&quot;). The latter track contains instrumentation from an acoustic guitar.35 Jason Thompson from PopMatters commented that Minogue &quot;knows how to express herself through irresistible melodies and seductive emoting&quot;,36 such as on the title track, which makes use of &quot;suggestive panting&quot;.37 Unlike Minogue's previous studio efforts, Fever does not contain any ballads.38
The lyrical content of Fever chiefly focuses on themes of love and enjoyment. Thompson described the album to be &quot;all about dancing, fucking, and having a good time&quot;.39 In the song &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, Minogue describes how she fell in love with her partner at &quot;first sight&quot; and how it led to good things happening for her.40 &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; was termed a &quot;mystery&quot; as the singer never mentions who the her object of desire in the song is.41 Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either &quot;a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists&quot; as her obsession.42 The production of &quot;Give It to Me&quot; contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to &quot;slow down,&quot; but the beat &quot;goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push it a little more on the dance floor.&quot;43 The lyrics of &quot;Fragile&quot; are simple and aim directly at the &quot;[listener's] heart&quot;.44 &quot;Come into My World&quot; is a &quot;plea for love&quot; as Minogue invites her partner into her life.45 On the other hand, &quot;Dancefloor&quot; focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by &quot;lose[ing] it in the music&quot;.46
Release and artwork
Fever was released by Parlophone on 1 October 2001, in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other European countries.4748 In the United States, the album was released by Capitol Records on 26 February 2002,4950 and was Minogue's first album to be released in the country since her second studio album Enjoy Yourself (1989).51 Thus, Minogue was reintroduced to the US after nearly 13 years of inactivity in the region.52 A special edition of the album, containing a previously unreleased track entitled &quot;Whenever You Feel Like It&quot;, was released on 19 November 2002.53
Minogue's close friend and stylist William Baker, collaborated with graphic designer Tony Hung to create the artwork's concept of electro-minimalism.54 On the cover, which was photographed by Vincent Peters, Minogue is seen &quot;bound by a microphone cord, literally tied to her craft&quot; and dressed in white leotard designed by Fee Doran, under the label of Mrs Jones, and shoes made by Manolo Blahnik.55 In her 2012 fashion retrospective book Kylie / Fashion, Minogue commented on the album's theme, saying: &quot;The whole campaign was so strong, sure, ice cool. Willie's [William's] styling was incredible and [Peters'] photography made for a second amazing album cover with him.&quot;56 A new cover was issued for the US version of the album and features a close-up of Minogue biting on a bracelet.57 The US version cover also served as the cover for second single of the album, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;.58

Critical reception
Fever received generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Fever received an average score of 68 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.105 Jason Thompson from PopMatters gave the album an extremely positive review and praised the conception and production of the album, calling it a &quot;perfect album of gorgeous dance music&quot; and claiming that &quot;there probably won't be a better album like it all year long&quot;.106 Chris True from AllMusic also gave it an acclaimed review and enjoyed the simple disco and dancepop music of the album, saying that there is &quot;not one weak track, not one misplaced syrupy ballad to ruin the groove&quot;.107 Alex Needham from NME positively reviewed the album and noted that while the album lacks depth, it is &quot;as effervescent as a foot spa&quot; and that through the album, Minogue &quot;shows the upstarts how it's done&quot;.108 Dominique Leone from Pitchfork Media gave it a favourable review and praised its simple and &quot;comfortable&quot; composition, terming it a &quot;mature sound from a mature artist, and one that may very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation&quot;.109
Alexis Petridis from The Guardian praised the commercial nature of the album and called it a &quot;a mature pop album only in that it's aimed at the boozy girl's night out rather than the school disco&quot;.110 Jacqueline Hodges favoured the album's consistency and complimented its commercial prospect, predicting that the album is &quot;going to sell bucket loads&quot;.111 Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly labelled the album &quot;the best guilty-pleasure retro-dance smash since Eiffel 65's &quot;Blue&quot;&quot;, but felt that Minogue &quot;milks the formula (of &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;) dry on the album&quot;.112 Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH enjoyed the fun nature of the album and said that &quot;if you want something to drive to, dance to, play at a house party or cheer your workmates up with, Fever is for you&quot;.113 Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a negative review, criticizing Minogue's &quot;painfully precise&quot; vocals and the album's monotiny.114

Impact and legacy
 Following its release, Fever reportedly sold over six million copies worldwide, becoming Minogue's highest selling album, as of today.146147 The album's lead single &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; peaked atop charts in 40 countries148 and sold more than five million copies worldwide,149 becoming Minogue's highest selling single till date150 and one of the best-selling singles of all time. The song is notable for being Minogue's biggest and strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States, a region in which Minogue previously had managed to achieve little success.151152153154155 It is also considered to be Minogue's signature song.156 Due to the single's commercial impact,157 the album enjoyed similar success in the United States and earned Minogue her only platinum album certification in the region.158 The album's success in Russia led to Minogue becoming the first non-Russian music artist to be awarded the &quot;diamond&quot; award by the National Federation of Phonograph Producers.159
Following its release, Fever was considered to be a prominent example of Minogue's constant &quot;reinventions&quot;.160161 The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as &quot;slick, minimalist and postmodern&quot;, and it was seen as a step forward from the &quot;camp-infused&quot; tone of Light Years.162 Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term &quot;nu-disco diva&quot; to describe Minogue during this period.163 Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue's public image and her persona in her music videos &quot;presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal&quot;.164 He further remarked that the singer's &quot;hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, tonguing the sweet-and-sour tang of a techno kiss&quot;.165 Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a &quot;classy piece of work&quot; and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in &quot;the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [Spears] and Christina [Aguilera]&quot;.166 Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear's recording of her 2004 hit &quot;Toxic&quot;, Madonna's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Paris Hilton's musical debut Paris (2006), and radio stations' shift towards playing &quot;more groove-oriented sounds&quot; all followed the release of Fever, although he admitted that &quot;we have no way of knowing whether Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings&quot;.167 Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; cemented her position as an international music icon, saying &quot;Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well&quot;.168
Fever also brought Minogue a number of accolades and award nominations. At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards ceremony, the album won the awards for &quot;Best Pop Release&quot; and &quot;Highest Selling Album&quot;, and garnered a nomination in the category of &quot;Album of the Year&quot;.169 At the same ceremony, &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; won the awards for &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;Highest Selling Single&quot;, and Minogue won the &quot;Outstanding Achievement Award&quot;.170 At the 2002 Brit Awards ceremony, Fever won the award for &quot;Best International Album&quot;, while Minogue was nominated for &quot;Best International Female Solo Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Act&quot;, winning the former.171 At the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony, the album was nominated for &quot;Best Album&quot;; Minogue was nominated for &quot;Best Female Act&quot;, &quot;Best Dance Act&quot;, and &quot;Best Pop Act&quot;, winning the latter two.172173 During this period, Minogue earned her first Grammy Award nomination when &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; was nominated in the category of &quot;Best Dance Recording&quot; at the 2003 award ceremony, although it lost to British electronic band Dirty Vegas's song &quot;Days Go By&quot;.174175 She eventually won a Grammy Award when &quot;Come Into my World&quot; was nominated in the same category at the 2004 award ceremony.176 It marked the first time an Australian music artist had won an award in a major category at the American award show since Australian rock band Men at Work won the award for &quot;Best New Artist&quot; in 1982.177 The song is Minogue's only Grammy award winning song to this date.178
