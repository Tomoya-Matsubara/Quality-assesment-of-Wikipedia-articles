Miss America
In 2006 she placed Runner-up for Miss Teen America.15 For the Miss America pageant, Davuluri prepared for an entire year. According to her grandmother Koteswaramma support came from &quot;her mother, most importantly she has strong attachment to India and the city of Vijayawada,&quot; where she spent 2 years as a baby girl.16 Davuluri was crowned Miss America on September 15, 2013, a win that was met by a backlash of anti-Indian sentiments in social media. 1718 News agencies cited tweets that misidentified her as Muslim or Arab and associated her with terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda.1920 Davuluri responded to this criticism, &quot;I have to rise above that, I always viewed myself as first and foremost American.&quot;21
Davuluri is the second Miss Syracuse (who was also Miss New York) to win the competition after Vanessa Williams's (the first African American winner of the crown) 1983 win (for the 1984 title). Both she and Williams won their crowns when the pageant was held in Atlantic City and both had to face backlash over their respective wins.22 Congresswoman Grace Meng congratulated Davuluri and compared her win with the first Jewish-American title won by Bess Myerson in 1945. 23 Davuluri was left on stage with first Runner-Up Chinese-American Miss California Crystal Lee when she said, &quot;We&lt;U+2019&gt;re making history standing here as Asian Americans.&quot;24
