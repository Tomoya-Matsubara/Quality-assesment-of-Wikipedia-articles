Weston-super-Mare is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.
Boundaries
The constituency covers the southern half of North Somerset Unitary Authority, including the town of Weston-super-Mare, the villages of Kewstoke, Locking, Hutton, Banwell, Winscombe, Congresbury, Churchill and Blagdon, and several smaller villages.

This is a minor boundary change to make the constituency boundary conform to local authority ward boundaries. The change affects only around 100 electors.
