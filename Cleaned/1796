Arkia Israeli Airlines (&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05E7&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;, Hebrew: &quot;I will go towards the sky&quot;) is an airline based in Tel Aviv, Israel. It is Israel's second largest airline operating scheduled domestic and international services as well as charters to western Europe and the Mediterranean. Its main base is Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, and it has a hub at Sde Dov Airport in Tel Aviv.1
History
In 1949, Eilat, Israel's southern-most city is founded, and Eilata Airlines is founded to maintain direct air service between Eilat and the center of the country. The airline was owned by El Al, and Israel's labour federation, Histradut, and took off in 1950. In this time, the airline had evolved from Eilata Airlines, to Aviron, and then to Arkia Airlines. In its first year of service, Arkia carried 13,485 passengers on their twice weekly flight, operated by a Curtis Commando.
During the 1950s the airline continued to grow, upgrading their fleet to the larger DC-3, and flying two flights daily. This allowed them to have annual passenger figures of over 70,000. As Eilat continued to grow during the 60's, so did Arkia, introducing the Handley Page Dart Herald series 200 jet prop aircraft to its fleet between 1967-1968, enabling Arkia to expand with new routes to Jerusalem, Sharm-el-Sheikh, and Santa Caterina. A subsidiary, Kanaf Arkia Airline and Aviation Services was founded as the airline acquired 50% of the stock of Kanaf Airlines and Aviation Services, and by the end of the 60's, scheduled flights were flown across Israel, from Rosh Pina in the north, to Ophira in the south.
In March 1980, Kanaf Arkia acquired the remaining stock of Arkia and merged the two operations. The airline grew fast during the 80's, moving into the international charter market, and airline maintenance. The airline is now owned by Kanaf-Arkia Airlines (75%) and airline employees (25%). In 2006, the Nakash brothers of Jordache Enterprises, bought Knafaims 75% share.
On November 28, 2002, approximately 20 minutes before the Kenyan hotel bombing occurred, an Arkia Boeing 757 was narrowly missed by two anti-aircraft missiles shortly after takeoff from Moi International Airport in Kenya. The plane was able to land safely in Tel Aviv. 23
In February 2007, the Israeli Tourism Ministry awarded Arkia scheduled operator license for flights to Larnaca, Cyprus (which El Al recently dropped) and Dublin, Ireland. These are the first international routes which the airline will be able to operate on a scheduled basis. 4
