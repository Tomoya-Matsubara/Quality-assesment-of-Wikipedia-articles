The Wallkill Valley Rail Trail is a  rail trail and linear park that runs along the former Wallkill Valley Railroad rail corridor in Ulster County, New York. The trail serves hikers, joggers, bikers, horseback riders, and cross country skiers. It currently runs from Gardiner through New Paltz to Rosendale.1 The addition of an  section in 2009 effectively doubled the length of the trail from  to ,2 extending it north from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston.3 Ulster County drafted plans in 2008 to connect the trail with both the Shawangunk Rail Trail to the south and Hudson Valley Rail Trail to the east.4
There are several former rail bridges along the trail, notably the Rosendale trestle, a  bridge that can be considered the &quot;most awesome part&quot; of the former Wallkill Valley Railroad.5 The trail passes by several historic sites, such as the Huguenot Street Historic District in New Paltz,6 the Binnewater Historic District and Snyder Estate Natural Cement Historic District in Rosendale,7 as well as a defunct 19th-century creamery in Gardiner.8 It crosses both the Wallkill River and Rondout Creek, as well as Route 44/55, NY 299, and NY 213.9 The Shawangunk Ridge is visible from clearings along the rail.10 Passing through a variety of habitats, the trail is frequented by many types of birds and animals.11
History
Stretching 12 from Montgomery to Kingston,13 the Wallkill Valley Railroad operated from 186614 until December 31, 1977.15 During the 1980s its owner, Conrail, began to salvage the former corridor's steel rails and sell off sections of the rail bed.16 State law mandated that preference in such sales be given first to the state, then to the involved counties and municipalities.1718 The state bought a  portion of rail bed between Shawangunk and Gardiner in November 1985 for the construction of the Shawangunk Correctional Facility in Wallkill.1920 The town of Shawangunk has been planning since 2004 to bypass the facility to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with the Shawangunk Rail Trail.21 A connection between the two trails is included as a project in a 2008 county-wide transportation plan.22
While Montgomery and Shawangunk purchased their sections of the railroad &lt;U+2013&gt; , respectively23 &lt;U+2013&gt; in 1985, eventually creating the 24 Shawangunk Rail Trail,25 the towns of New Paltz, Gardiner and Rosendale initially declined to purchase their sections of the rail line.26 The trail was the seventeenth rail trail created in New York state,27 and it became a National Recreation Trail in 2007.28
New Paltz and Gardiner
 In 1988, New Paltz invited a local non-profit, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust, to acquire the portion of the rail line between New Paltz and Gardiner. The Wallkill Valley Land Trust in turn requested assistance from The Trust for Public Land, and the purchase was completed on January 18, 1991.29 While the town and village of New Paltz immediately purchased their sections from the Wallkill Valley Land Trust &lt;U+2013&gt; roughly , respectively30 &lt;U+2013&gt; Gardiner did not purchase its  section until 2007.3132
The Gardiner section begins  south of the hamlet of Gardiner at Denniston Road, and continues on through New Paltz.33 Prior to its 2007 purchase the Gardiner section was unmaintained, and by 2004 it was in such a state of disrepair that the Wallkill Valley Land Trust almost closed it. Purchasing the section allowed Gardiner to fix the drainage problems that had deteriorated the surface of the trail, and to ban the use of motor vehicles, something the Wallkill Valley Land Trust had not done. Gardiner worked out a $70,000 sale price with the Wallkill Valley Land Trust in 2004, though the property at that time was worth $307,300. The Gardiner section passes by a defunct creamery.34 The creamery, opened in 1882, was one of the dairies that transported its products to New York City by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad.35 The former Gardiner railroad station became a sporting goods store by 1981,36 an antique store by 1995,37 and burned down in January 2001.38
The purchase was completed after Gardiner received a $100,000 grant from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation in December 2006.39 The state provided an additional $5,000 the following year to maintain the trail.40 In 2009 and 2010, the Tea Party movement held protests along the Gardiner section of the trail.4142
 There are two notable bridges within the New Paltz section, the Plattekill Creek bridge along the southern border with Gardiner, and the Springtown bridge to the north. Both were originally made of timber and constructed in 1870.43 A passing train accidentally set fire to the Plattekill Creek bridge in 1880, prompting the Wallkill Valley Railroad to coat its ties with tin while replacing its wooden bridges with ones made of stone.44 The bridge was rebuilt in 1912, and crosses the Plattekill Creek at a height of . Its original abutments were made of Shawangunk conglomerate.45
The Springtown bridge spans the Wallkill River,46 and was rebuilt using iron in 1881. It was rated by the superintendent of the Wallkill Valley Railroad to be safe for rail traffic as fast as .47 The bridge's current decking and benches were put in place in 1993 by volunteers and members of the nearby Hutterite community in Rifton.48 It is  long, with a trestle length of , and has 420 bridge ties.49
 Portions of the New Paltz&lt;U+2013&gt;Gardiner section were informally open since June 1991, but the formal opening ceremony of the full 50 trail between New Paltz and Gardiner took place on October 9, 1993.51
In November 2009, New Paltz received grants from the Greenway Conservancy, a state organization, to fund three rail trail&lt;U+2013&gt;related projects. This included $17,750 to create a link52 between the New Paltz section of the trail and the Hudson Valley Rail Trail in nearby Lloyd,53 which is being extended to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The Wallkill Valley Railroad had been planning such a connection with the bridge since it opened in 1889, but never built one.54 The grants also included $1,500 to print brochures publicizing the new link, and $7,000 to create  of ADA-accessible trail to connect the parking area of the Sojourner Truth park with the rail trail.55 This addition included a small footbridge constructed by Alexandria-based CONTECH, with a weight limit of .56 The town had intended to connect the parking area with the trail since 1998, but concerns over traffic, as well as state requirements, had added to the time and cost of the path; it was completed by June 2010.5758 The connections are part of a county-wide plan to create a bicycle path along NY 299, to link regional rail trails.59
Rosendale
 The Rosendale portion of the rail bed runs  from Rosendale through Ulster to Kingston and contains a  bridge6061 with a trestle length of .62 The bridge rises  above the Rondout Creek and Route 213,63 and also spans the former Delaware and Hudson Canal.64 At the time of its construction it was the highest span bridge in the United States.65
Construction on the bridge's abutments began in the fall of 1870 by A. L. Dolby &amp; Company, but work of the superstructure by the Paterson-based Waston Manufacturing Company didn't begin until the following year due to persistent quicksand during the excavation.66 The bridge originally had seven67  wrought-iron spans, as well as two  wooden spans. It cost $125,000 to build. Roughly  of iron, as well as  of timber went into its construction.68 The bridge opened to rail traffic on April 6, 1872.69
 In the 1880s the bridge supports were reinforced,70 and the bridge itself was rebuilt by the King Bridge Company between 1895 and 189671 using steel rather than iron to allay public concerns over its strength.72 The rebuilt bridge was unaffected by a large cave-in at a local Rosendale cement quarry on December 26, 1899.73 By 1975, the rail line had deteriorated to the point where federal regulations allowed only  traffic over the trestle. The sturdiness of the bridge had been a deciding factor in Conrail's decision to close the Wallkill Valley Railroad in 1977.74
Conrail sold the Rosendale section, including the bridge, in 1986 to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.75 Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl installed planking and guard rails on the southern half of the bridge,76 which was then opened to the public.77 He intended to allow bungee jumping off the bridge,7879 but the town of Rosendale prevented him from doing so in January 1992.80 Another individual, Douglas Hase, tried unsuccessfully in 2003 and 2004 to get a variance for such a venture.8182
After Rahl failed to pay $13,716 in property taxes over a period of three years,83 Ulster County foreclosed on the  property on April 15, 2009. The Wallkill Valley Land Trust and Open Space Conservancy placed a bid on the property on April 22, 2009,84 and agreed to pay all outstanding taxes before receiving full ownership on July 8, 200985 with the intention of adding it to the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail.86 Following an engineering survey, the bridge was closed to the public in June 2009 for repairs.87 Renovations are expected to begin in spring 2011, with a 12-month completion time.88
Canopy Development, a green development company from Northampton, Massachusetts,89 owns a portion of the former rail bed in Rosendale but has agreed to establish a right-of-way.90 Another obstructed section between Rosendale and Ulster is a private swimming pool, which will be bypassed.91
Recreation and activities
 In New Paltz, the trail passes through Huguenot Street, a historic district containing stone houses, some of which date to the late 1600s.92 It also passes by the former New Paltz station, now a restaurant.93 Several shale outcrops are visible along the trail,94 with views of the Shawangunk Ridge to the west.9596 The trail connects with the Sojourner Truth park in New Paltz, which has access to the Wallkill River for kayaking and canoeing.97 The Minnewaska Preserve and Mohonk Preserve, featuring  of combined walkways, can be reached through New Paltz.98
In Rosendale, the trail connects to the Binnewater Historic District. The Binnewater region was the location of several local quarries, which opened throughout the region after the discovery of Rosendale cement in 1825 in nearby High Falls. At its peak, the district was producing 4,000,000 barrels a year and employed 5,000 people.99 Another historic district, the Snyder Estate, runs along the Rosendale section. The Snyder Estate is a former mining site once used by all four major regional cement producers.100
Parking for the trail is provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner.101 In New Paltz, there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park,102 off Springtown Road, at the Huguenot Historical Society, and at a BOCES conference center.103 There is also a park and ride adjacent to the trail in Rosendale on Route 32,104 and parking by Mountain Road. There are two bicycle shops along the trail in both Gardiner and New Paltz.105
Flora
Flora along the northern end of the trail includes Sumac (Rhus) and Honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American Elm (Ulmus americana), Bigtooth Aspen (Populus grandidentata) and Quaking Aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum), American Beech (Fagus grandifolia), Tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and Black Birch (Betula lenta).106 Other trees common on the trail include Red Maple (Acer rubrum), Shagbark Hickory (Carya ovata), Northern Pin Oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), Eastern Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana), White Ash (Fraxinus americana) and Eastern White Pine (Pinus strobus).107
Fauna
Many animals pass through the trail unobserved, leaving behind tracks. This includes bears, deer, coyotes, dogs, bobcats, cats, skunks and rabbits.108 Several bird species overwinter in the region and can be observed from the trail, such as the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura), Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), Bluebird (Sialia), Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Downy Woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), American Goldfinch (Spinus tristis), Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), Black-capped Chickadee (Poecile atricapillus), Sparrow (Passer) and Purple Finch (Carpodacus purpureus).109
