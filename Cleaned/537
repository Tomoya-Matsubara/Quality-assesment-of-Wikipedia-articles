History
Spanish colonists established Villa de San Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n de Auxerre, also known as Nueva Salamanca, in the early years of the 16th century. The town of San Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n grew out of the settlement formally established in 1573, and it is this original urban core, transformed by rapid growth from the 1830s to the 1940s, that comprises the San Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Historic District.
The district includes numeorous homes including the noted Victorian-style Juan Ortiz Perichi House on Luna Street, which architect Jorge Rigau once called &quot;one of the best developed spatial sequences in residential architecture in Puerto Rico.&quot; Many notable Puerto Ricans came from the San Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Historic District; among them was Lola Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez de Ti&lt;U+00F3&gt;, the well-known poet and political leader who wrote the lyrics of Puerto Rico's unoffical national anthem, &quot;La Borinque&lt;U+00F1&gt;a.&quot;
The San Germ&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Historic District is roughly bounded by Luna, Estrella, Concepci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, Javilla, and Ferrocarril streets in the western section of the town.
