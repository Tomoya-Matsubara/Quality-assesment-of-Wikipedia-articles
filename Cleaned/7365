77 Diamonds is an online retailer of diamonds and diamond jewellery based in the United Kingdom, but operating throughout the world. The company claims to have the largest selection of certified natural diamonds in the world. They have been called &quot;one of the most innovative online diamond companies to sell loose and set diamond jewellery in the UK.&quot; 12
History
77 Diamonds was founded by Tobias Kormind, a former investment banker at Morgan Stanley,3 with Vadim Weinig in 2005. Kormind believes precious metal hallmarking could be privatized, just like diamond certification, and says it needs to be quicker, cheaper and offer more outlets.4 The company takes its name from the date that the first diamond engagement ring was given, when Archduke Maximilian I of Austria presented one to Mary of Burgundy in the year 1477.5
In 2010, 77 Diamonds featured in Vogue's inaugural 'Fashion's Night In' feature, devoted to offering discounts from a selection of the most fashionable online retailers.67
Operations
77 Diamonds customers either build their own diamond ring, buy rings off the shelf, or even buy loose diamonds.8 Each diamond comes with a certificate of authenticity, which the company&lt;U+2019&gt;s founders, Kormind and Weinig, say is key when it comes to customer confidence. They also believe diamonds will rise above the inflation index.9 77 Diamonds has access to over 70% of the world's polished diamonds and has the largest selection of certified natural diamonds in the world.10 All of their diamonds are conflict-free and comply with the industry&lt;U+2019&gt;s strict Kimberley process regulations. 11
