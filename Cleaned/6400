&quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is a 37-line poem written in 1928 by American-English poet T. S. Eliot (1888&lt;U+2013&gt;1965). It is one of five poems that Eliot contributed for a series of 38 pamphlets by several authors collectively titled Ariel poems and released by British publishing house Faber and Gwyer (later, Faber and Faber). Published in September 1928, &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; was the sixteenth in the series and was accompanied by illustrations drawn by American-born avant garde artist Edward McKnight Kauffer (1890&lt;U+2013&gt;1954).1 The poems, including &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot;, were later published in both editions of Eliot's collected poems in 1936 and 1963.2
In the previous year, Eliot had converted to Anglo-Catholicism and his poetry, starting with the Ariel Poems (1927&lt;U+2013&gt;1931) and Ash Wednesday (1930), took on a decidedly religious character.3 The poem is seen by many critics and scholars as a discussion of the conversion experience. In the poem, Eliot retells the story of Simeon from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke, a just and devout Jew who encounters Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus entering the Temple of Jerusalem. Promised by the Holy Ghost that he would not die until he had seen the Saviour, Simeon sees in the infant Jesus the Messiah promised by the Lord and asks God to permit him to &quot;depart in peace.&quot; ()
The poem's narrative mimics the Nunc dimittis, a liturgical prayer for Compline derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes, Dante Alighieri, St. John of the Cross. Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence of Eliot's anti-Semitism.
Writing and publication
 In 1925, Eliot became a poetry editor at the London publishing firm of Faber &amp; Gwyer, Ltd.,4 after a career in banking, and subsequent to the success of his earlier poems, including &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; (1915), &quot;Gerontion&quot; (1920) and &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922).
In these years, Eliot gravitated away from his Unitarian upbringing and began to embrace the Church of England which led to his baptism on 29 June 1927 at Finstock, in Oxfordshire, and his confirmation the following day in the private chapel of The Right Reverend Thomas Banks Strong, Bishop of Oxford.56 Eliot converted in private, but subsequently declared in his 1927 preface to a collection of essays titled For Lancelot Andrewes that he considered himself &quot;a classicist in literature, a royalist in politics, and an Anglo-Catholic in religion.&quot;789 When his conversion became known, it was &quot;an understandable choice to those around him&quot; given his intellectual convictions, and that &quot;he could not have done anything less than seek what he regarded as the most ancient, most sacramental, and highest expresession of the Christian faith that forms the indisputable basis for the culture and civilization of modern Europe.&quot;10 Eliot's conversion, and his adherence to Anglo-Catholicism, would inform and influence his later poetry.11 Critical reviews of Eliot's poems shifted as well, with some critics asserting that the Christian themes &quot;deprived his art of its once incomparable distinction in style and tone&quot;,12 while others recognized it as &quot;an evaluation of old age, an elucidation of its special grace, and an appreciation of its special function in the progress of the soul.&quot;13
In 1927, Eliot was asked by his employer, Geoffrey Faber, one of the partners in Faber &amp; Gwyer, to write one poem each year for a series of illustrated pamphlets with holiday themes to be sent to the firm's clients and business acquaintances as Christmas greetings.14 This series, called the &quot;Ariel Series&quot;, would release 38 pamphlets from a selection of English writers and poets from 1927 through 1931. The first poem that Eliot wrote, &quot;The Journey of the Magi&quot;, was released as the eighth in the series in August 1927.15 For the second, &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot;, Eliot turned to an event at the end of Nativity narrative in the Gospel of Luke. Faber released this pamphlet, the sixteenth in the series on 24 September 1928.1617 Eliot would follow with three more poems, &quot;Animula&quot; in October 1929, &quot;Marina&quot; in September 1930, and &quot;Triumphal March&quot; in October 1931. All five poems were accompanied by illustrations by American avant garde artist, E. McKnight Kauffer.
Faber &amp; Gwyer, Ltd., printed &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; in an 8&lt;U+00BD&gt;&quot; &lt;U+00D7&gt; 5&lt;U+00BD&gt;&quot; Demy Octavo (8vo) pamphlet &quot;in blue paper wraps with title in black ink&quot;.181920 The poem was printed on two pages, accompanied by Kauffer's colour image, and included one page of advertisements. Faber &amp; Gwyer contracted with the Curwen Press in Plaistow to print 3,500 copies.21 The font of the cover and poem text was &quot;Walbaum&quot; created by J. E. Walbaum of Goslar and Weimar in Germany in 1836.2223 According to Gilmour, the edition was printed &quot;in batches of eight.&quot;24
In 1936, Faber &amp; Faber, the successor firm to Faber &amp; Gwyer, collected &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; and the four other poems under the heading &quot;Ariel Poems&quot; for an edition of Eliot's collected poems.25 When Faber released the entire series in the 1950s, Eliot included a sixth poem, &quot;The Cultivation of Christmas Trees&quot;,26 which was added to Faber's 1963 edition of his collected poems.27 Both editions of collected poems were published in the United States by Harcourt, Brace &amp; Company.28
Interpretation and analysis
&lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; &lt;U+0413&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; (&quot;The Meeting of the Lord&quot;), a depiction of Simeon recognizing Jesus at the Temple, from a fifteenth-century Novgorodskye School Russian icon
Gospel narrative and the Nunc dimittis
Most scholars and critics addressing the poem focus on the Gospel narrative for a source of interpretation as Eliot's poem quotes several lines verbatim from the passage in Luke, from the Nunc dimittis, and is &quot;characterized by deliberately Biblical language interwoven with actual phrases from the Gospels.&quot;2930
The subject of Eliot's poem is drawn from the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (), and the early Christian canticle Nunc dimittis derived from it.31 In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be presented in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is &quot;waiting for the consolation of Israel&quot; after being promised that &quot;he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.&quot; () Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come.32 This prayer would become known later as the Nunc Dimittis from its Latin incipit.33
 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace : according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen : thy salvation, Which thou hast prepared : before the face of all people; To be a light to lighten the Gentiles : and to be the glory of thy people Israel. () 
The Nunc dimittis is the traditional &quot;Gospel Canticle&quot; of Night Prayer that is often called the Song of Simeon or Canticle of Simeon. In the Roman Catholic tradition, it was used during the Office for Compline, the last of the Canonical hours, in the Liturgy of the Hours.34 The Anglican tradition combined liturgy of the Catholic offices of Vespers (especially with the Magnificat canticle) and Compline (with the Nunc dimittis) into Evening Prayer when compiling the Book of Common Prayer during the English Reformation.35
In 1886, Eliot's grandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot, an American educator and Unitarian minister, wrote a poem titled &quot;Nunc dimittis.&quot; Written a few months before his death, the elder Eliot's poem used the same gospel text and the poet asks, in his decline, &quot;When may I humbly claim that kind award, / And cares and labors cease?&quot;363738 &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is seen by some scholars as a tacit tribute by Eliot to his grandfather, &quot;for the last years of a grandfather whose faith his grandson has at last taken up for himself.&quot;3940
Scholars have identified allusions by Eliot to other biblical passages, including:
&quot;Before the stations of the mountain of desolation&quot; in line 19 and the reference to &quot;the fox's home&quot; in line 15 as a reference to Calvary (Golgotha), or to  &quot;the mountain of zion...is desolate, the foxes walk upon it&quot;. The fox reference is also thought to be connected to , and .41
The stations in line 19, and the time of cords, scourges and lamentation in line 17 refers to Christ's passion and crucifixion, in particular his scourging at the orders of Pontius Pilate and the lamenting of women along the Via Dolorosa described in .42
&quot;The goat's path&quot; of line 15, is a reference to the scapegoat of .43
That the &quot;Fleeing from foreign faces and the foreign swords&quot; is from prophesies of grief, hiding and pursuit in , and crucifixion events mentioned in in , . Two scholars connect this to Ezekiel's prophesy of &quot;death by the hands of strangers.&quot;4445
Anthony Hands also sees the influence of  on the language of the poem.46
Conversion
&quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is not one of Eliot's significant poems and is thus overshadowed by his comparatively more well-known works of the period, including &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; (1925), &quot;The Journey of the Magi&quot; (1927), &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; (1930), and the later, more substantial Four Quartets (1943) However, in these poems, Eliot continues the progression of his themes of alienation in a changing world, and fuses with this the tenets of his newfound faith.47 Literary scholar Martin Scofield states that the imagery of the poem, of the symbol of a feather and its setting amid Roman hyacinths and the winter sun conveys &quot;a sense of wonder and fragile new life.&quot;48. The Reverend Robin Griffith-Jones, an Anglican cleric, compares Eliot's image of the feather to statement by Hildegard of Bingen comparing herself &quot;to 'a feather which lacks all weight and strength and flies through the wind'; so she was borne up by God. But Eliot&lt;U+2019&gt;s speaker, still waiting for the wind to blow, imagines only the death wind that will bear him away.&quot;49 According to Joseph Maddrey, &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; shares themes with his more famous conversion poem &lt;U+201C&gt;Ash Wednesday&lt;U+201D&gt;, the first parts of which Eliot was writing when &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon to illustrate the &quot;contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two.&quot;50
Eliot's Ariel poems and Ash Wednesday all explore this new experience of conversion, and toward the progress of the soul.51 Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents &quot;a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has come too late for this life.&quot;52 But as he awaits and asks for his death Simeon's understanding, he sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission. Simeon wants nothing of this &quot;time of sorrow&quot;, adding that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him.53
 According to thy word. They shall praise Thee and suffer in every generation With glory and derision, Light upon light, mounting the saints&lt;U+2019&gt; stair. Not for me the martyrdom, the ecstasy of thought and prayer, Not for me the ultimate vision.54 
According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon, &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; and the Ariel poems, &quot;Eliot wonders if he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being properly committed, whose ostentatious piety is 'tainted with a self-conceit.'&quot;55 The poem is inherently tied to Eliot's religious conversion experience, and connected to Eliot's reading of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes during this time. Andrewes, in an 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon, emphasized that conversion &quot;must come from both mind and heart, thought and feeling, 'the principall and most proper act of a true turning to God.'&quot;5657 Andrewes' words are channeled again, when Eliot's Simeon &quot;sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in &quot;the still unspeaking and unspoken Word'.&quot;58 Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase&lt;U+2014&gt;an image that also appears in &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; which Gordon states is a direct reference to this sermon, adding that &quot;Eliot&lt;U+2019&gt;s penitent ... 'turning on the winding stair', acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion: a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one&lt;U+2019&gt;s sins, sentencing oneself for the past.&quot;59
The image of a winding stair has also been tied to scenes in Dante's journey from Purgatory to Paradise in the Divine Comedy.60 Further, the image is thought associated with stairs as the path of mystical ascent in the writings of sixteenth-century Spanish mystic and saint John of the Cross.6162 Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems.63
Eliot's Simeon appears similar to Dante's depiction of Virgil in the Divine Comedy, as &quot;the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot enter the world that he makes possible.&quot;64 Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, leads Dante through Hell (Inferno) and Purgatory (Purgatorio), but cannot guide him into Paradise&lt;U+2014&gt;as a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities, can help him no further in his approach to God.65 In Eliot, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing &quot;the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy.&quot;6667
Anti-Semitism
Eliot's poems have frequently been criticized for instances of Anti-Semitism&lt;U+2014&gt;prejudice or discrimination against Jews. Scholar Louis Menard states that while Simeon is treated respectfully by Eliot, his characterization is &quot;in the tradition of Christian condescension toward the virtuous heathen.&quot;68 Comparatively, Craig Raine, a poet and New College, Oxford emeritus professor who wrote a book-length defense of Eliot against the claims of deliberate anti-Semitism, argues that &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; provides a sympathetic discussion of the Jewish diaspora.69 University of British Columbia scholar John Xiros Cooper states that the accusations of anti-Semitism lodged against Eliot rest &quot;on a few isolated lines of poetry&quot; and a passing reference in one prose text.70 Indeed, Eliot denied the claim in his life time, stating declaratively, &quot;I am not an anti-Semite and never have been. It is a terrible slander on a man.&quot;71
Anthony Julius, a British lawyer who is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that &quot;A Song for Simeon&quot; is &lt;U+201C&gt;exceptional in a poetry in which elsewhere Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it...The song is for, not of Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth.&quot;72 He further states that Jews have no role in the Christian future, quoting Eliot's earlier poem, &quot;Gerontion&quot;, he states that the Jews &quot;may find a ledge there to squat on&quot;.73 Julius compares Simeon to Moses&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;fated to see the Promised Land but not to enter it. Witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity&lt;U+2019&gt;s gates.&quot;74 Julius accuses Eliot of animating &quot;the topoi of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence.&quot;75
Julius' view is considered extreme by many critics,76 and is tempered by his own argument that Eliot's anti-Semitism does not detract from his poetry and assessment that his anti-Semitism is a creative force showing rare imaginative power and empowering his art.&lt;U+201D&gt;77 Literary critic and professor Christopher Ricks agreed, citing the wit and commentary of Eliot's depictions of Jews; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice.7879
