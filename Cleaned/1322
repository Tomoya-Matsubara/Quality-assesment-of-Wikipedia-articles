The Svalbard Rocket Range () or SvalRak is a launch site for sounding rockets at Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund in Svalbard, Norway. The site has been in use since 1997 and is owned by And&lt;U+00F8&gt;ya Rocket Range, which is again owned by the Norwegian Space Centre and the Kongsberg Group. SvalRak's location at the 79th parallel north makes it well-suited for launching rockets to investigate Earth's magnetic field. It is used mostly by American, Japanese and Norwegian researchers. It is the world's northern-most launch site.
History
The Svalbard Rocket Range is used by agencies such as NASA to launch sounding rockets
Planning of a launch site in Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund started in 1993,1 a location chosen because of its ideal location to study the polar cusp.2 Construction of the site started in the summer of 1997.3 The Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which conducts air measurements in Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund, was concerned that the rockets could pollute their measurements.4 A test rocket was launched on 15 November.5 The first proper launch was a Norwegian rocket, Isbj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rn 1, which contained instruments from University Centre in Svalbard, the University of Troms&lt;U+00F8&gt; and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment.6 The  rocket had a payload of  and reached  altitude.7 It was followed by two Black Brant rockets for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration which reached an altitude of .8
SvalRak originally held permission to fire four rockets every four years.9 Forty-one rockets had been launched by 2004, with a peak altitude of .10 The site was upgraded in 2008.11
Use
SvalRak is the world's northern-most rocket launch site, and is located at the 79th parallel north.12 This makes it an ideal location for sending instruments into Earth's magnetic field and the polar cups, cleft and cup.13 It is also used for studying the Magnetopause and aurora borealis, for which Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund is the most convenient location because of its ease of access.14 It is owned by And&lt;U+00F8&gt;ya Rocket Range, which is owned by the Norwegian Space Center (90 percent) and the Kongsberg Group (10 percent). SvalRak has no permanent staff in Ny-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lesund.15 The main users are American and Japanese and to a less extent Norwegian.16
