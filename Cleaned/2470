Maria Louise Kanellis (born February 25, 1982)1 is an American singer-songwriter, actress, model, and professional wrestler, also known simply as Maria. She is best known for her time with World Wrestling Entertainment, and is working for Ring of Honor as the valet of her real-life boyfriend Mike Bennett.
Kanellis's career began as a contestant on the reality show Outback Jack in 2004. In the same year, she placed fifth in the Raw Diva Search, but was later hired by WWE as a backstage interviewer. Kanellis began competing in the ring as a wrestler in 2005. She also posed for the April 2008 cover of Playboy magazine, which was incorporated into a storyline on Raw. She released her debut album Sevin Sins on April 13, 2010 on iTunes.
Early life
Kanellis was born in Ottawa, Illinois.2 She has two younger siblings; a brother and sister named Bill and Janny respectively.345 Kanellis grew up with an interest in playing sports, particularly volleyball, basketball, and softball and graduated from Ottawa Township High School in 2000, before spending some time as a student at Northern Illinois University.6 Before her career in wrestling began, Kanellis regularly competed in beauty pageants.7
Professional wrestling career
World Wrestling Entertainment
Diva Search and debut (2004&lt;U+2013&gt;2005)
 She competed in the Raw Diva Search in 2004,8 deciding to enter the contest after seeing an advertisement while watching Raw.9 Even though she only placed fifth in the contest, she was hired by the company.10 She stood out in the contest by giving fellow contestant Carmella DeCesare the finger after being eliminated from the contest.11 Maria began making appearances at the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) training facility under head trainer Paul Heyman.12 She contributed booking ideas, and her work at OVW earned her a spot on the Raw brand roster.13 Maria was brought on to Raw as a ditzy backstage interviewer and the host of WWE KissCam in November 2004.14 Maria was given the dumb blonde gimmick despite having brown hair. She quickly earned a reputation as the oblivious backstage reporter&lt;U+2014&gt;Maria seemed to ask the wrong questions, irritating and amusing WWE Superstars and Divas.1516
In 2005, Maria began to get very physical&lt;U+2014&gt;in and out of the ring. She was defeated in her first official match on the January 10, 2005 episode of Raw by Christy Hemme in a Lingerie Pillow Fight.1718 She also competed in a Fulfill Your Fantasy Diva Battle Royal at Taboo Tuesday for the WWE Women's Championship but was the first to be eliminated by Trish Stratus and Mickie James.19 In another physical moment, Stratus slapped Maria so hard that one of her fillings legitimately fell out.20 On November 14, Maria competed in a non-title Diva Battle Royal at the Eddie Guerrero tribute Raw show. Maria stood by herself for most of the match, only getting involved when she saw the opportunity to eliminate a competitor, a strategy that proved effective as she eliminated both Jillian Hall and Victoria. She was one of the last three women left in the match but was eliminated by both Melina and Trish Stratus.21
On the November 28 episode of Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff and asked him whether or not he thought he was going to be fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam.22 As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his controversial actions as General Manager.23 As Mick Foley questioned her, she answered, &quot;Last week Bischoff abused his power in a way that was both malicious and capricious, and it's this rash of discourse that ultimately led to a locker room of disdain and mutiny, and it should be grounds for his immediate dismissal.&quot;24
Various Feuds; relationship with Santino Marella (2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2008)
In early 2006, Maria defeated Victoria in a match.25 Afterward, she was attacked by Vince's Devils (Victoria, Torrie Wilson, and Candice Michelle), but she was saved by Ashley Massaro. During a commercial break that night, Vince McMahon announced a Gauntlet Bra &amp; Panties Match for New Year's Revolution between all five girls that had previously been in the ring.26 At New Year's Revolution, Maria was the first to enter the Gauntlet match and eliminated Candice Michelle and Torrie Wilson before being eliminated by Victoria. The match was ultimately won by Massaro.27 On April 10, episode of Raw, Maria received a shot at the WWE Women's Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion Mickie James.
Maria teamed with John Cena to take on Edge and Lita in the main event on the February 6 episode of Raw.282930 Maria scored the victory after a spear meant for Cena hit Lita.31 One month later, Maria lost a singles match to Lita after missing a clothesline and falling prey to Lita's DDT. After the match, Edge was preparing to spear Maria, but Mick Foley ran in to help her.32 On October 16, Maria won a Fatal Four Way Bra and Panties match against Victoria, Candice Michelle, and Torrie Wilson to advance to the semi-finals in a Women's Championship Tournament.33 Maria, however, lost in the semi-finals of the tournament to Lita.34
On the January 1, 2007 episode of Raw, Maria attempted to interview Kevin Federline but was instead slapped by Melina and called a &quot;bitch&quot;. This led to a match between the two later that night, with Melina winning with a roll-up following a failed attempt at a dropkick. At New Year's Revolution, Maria and Candice Michelle ran to the ring during the Women's Championship match between Victoria and Mickie James to stop Melina from interfering, helping their friend Mickie to retain the championship.35 For two consecutive weeks afterward, Maria had two tag team partners&lt;U+2014&gt;Mickie James and Jeff Hardy, respectively&lt;U+2014&gt;to take on Melina and a partner. She lost the match with James,36 but won the other with Hardy.37 As a part of her entrance when teaming with Hardy, she mimicked the dance he performs at the top of the entrance ramp, a moment she later claimed as a favorite in her career.38
 Maria began an on-screen romance with Santino Marella in June 2007. She also resumed competing in the ring occasionally, often jobbing, or losing quickly, in short matches. On the November 5 episode of Raw, Marella was confronted by the returning Stone Cold Steve Austin for criticizing his movie, The Condemned. As a part of the storyline, the argument ended as Marella received a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin, who then went backstage, only to return with a Budweiser beer truck to hose down Marella and Maria with beer.
After former Playboy cover-girl Ashley Massaro's return in early 2008, Kanellis engaged in backstage segments where Ashley suggested Maria should be on the cover of Playboy, including at the Royal Rumble, to the disdain of Marella.3940 As a part of the Playboy storyline, Maria defeated Beth Phoenix on February 18, to &quot;earn the right&quot; to be on the cover of the magazine.41 During her Playboy cover unveiling, Maria's cover was plastered over with images of Marella.4243 After Marella offered an ultimatum of posing for the magazine or staying with him as a couple,44 she stated, &quot;No man and no one is going to make this decision for me&quot; and broke up with her on-screen boyfriend.45 Maria, along with Ashley, (who replaced Candice Michelle) were defeated by Phoenix and Melina at WrestleMania XXIV in a Playboy BunnyMania Lumberjack match.464748 After the match, Maria passionately kissed the Master of Ceremonies, Snoop Dogg.4950

On the February 10 episode of SmackDown, she defeated McCool following interference from Eve Torres.52 She also competed at WrestleMania XXV for the &quot;Miss Wrestlemania&quot; crown,but was eliminated by Victoria.
She made her in ring return on the July 3 episode of SmackDown teaming with Melina to defeat Michelle McCool and Layla.53 Soon after, she entered into an on-screen relationship with Dolph Ziggler, despite her being a fan favorite and him being a villainous character.5455 At Night of Champions, Maria accompanied Ziggler to his match with Rey Mysterio.56 In the following weeks, Melina implied that Ziggler was cheating on Maria, which Maria did not believe.57 Maria and Dolph Ziggler later broke up on the October 10 episode of SmackDown in a backstage segment, after she cost him his match.58
Maria then took a brief hiatus from the ring to film the Celebrity Apprentice but returned on the December 4 episode of SmackDown by helping Mickie James fend off an attack by Michelle McCool and Layla.
