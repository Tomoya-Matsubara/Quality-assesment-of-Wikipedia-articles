The Mystery of a Hansom Cab is a mystery fiction novel by English writer Fergus Hume.
Author
Originally from Britain, Fergus Hume worked as a barrister's clerk in Melbourne, Australia at the time of the book's first publication.1 Hume would go on to become a prolific writer, authoring more than 130 additional novels in fiction subjects including science fiction and adventure.234
Plot
The story of The Mystery of a Hansom Cab takes place in Melbourne, Australia, and involves an investigation into a homicide where the deceased was discovered in the evening inside of a taxicab. The city of Melbourne is itself a significant factor in the plot and setting, and is described by the author: &quot;Over all the great city hung a clould of smoke like a pall.&quot;5 Throughout the novel the influential and secretive Frettbly family is a key element, and it is revealed later in the book that they have an illegitimate daughter living on the streets. The name of the killer himself is not as much of a significant revelation in the story, as is the role of the Frettbly family and their secret. The class divide between the wealthy and less fortunate of the city of Melbourne is juxtaposed throughout the plot.6 The protagonist in the novel is a law enforcement official named Detective Gorby, who is tasked with solving the murder.7 Hume uses descriptive text to describe the character's investigative skills: &quot;He looked keenly round the room, and his estimate of the dead man's character was formed at once.&quot;8 The author commented in a later introduction, &quot;All of the scenes in the book, especially the slums, are described from personal observation; and I passed a great many nights in Little Bourke Street, gathering material&quot;.9
Publication history
The Mystery of a Hansom Cab was first published in Melbourne, Australia, in 1886, and subsequently published in Britain in 1887.10 The author self-published the first edition of the novel.1112 Hume wrote an introduction to a revised edition published in 1898.13

Whether travelling by road, rail or river the unpretending little volume was ever present in some companion's or stranger's hands.&quot;2829 The book outsold the 1887 publication of A Study in Scarlet by Arthur Conan Doyle.30
Reviews
A Companion to Crime Fiction (2010) by Charles J. Rzepka and Lee Horsley called The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, &quot;The most spectacular reimagining of the sensation novel, and a crucial point in the genre's transformation into detective fiction&quot;.31 A History of the Book in Australia 1891-1945 (2001) described the book as, &quot;a lively and engaging crime novel which used its Melbourne setting to considerable effect.&quot;32 Geoffrey Blainey wrote in A History of Victoria that The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, &quot;did more than any book to give the outside world a picture of Melbourne of the late 1880s&quot;.33 David Stuart Davies featured the work in his book Vintage Mystery and Detective Stories, writing, &quot;The author was determined to make a fortune by creating a story 'containing a mystery, a murder, and a description of low life in Melbourne'. He succeeded. Like a rich plum in our vintage mystery pudding we include the whole novel in this collection.&quot;34
