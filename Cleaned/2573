otherships HMS Leander
HMS Leander was a second class cruiser, name ship of the Royal Navy's first Leander class cruiser 1882 Leander-class cruisers.  During a revolution in Panama in 1900, the Leander helped protect the lives and property of foreign residents.
Design and construction
The Leander was built by Napier in Glasgow, being laid down in 1880, launched in 1882 and completed in 1885.  The Leander class were originally designated as steel dispatch vessels,http://www.britainsnavy.co.uk/Ships/HMS%20Leander/HMS%20Leander%201882%20CC%204.htm www.britainsnavy.co.uk HMS Leander but were reclassified as second class cruisers before they were completed.  The design was an improved version of the Iris class cruiser Iris class, with a armoured deck and better armament.http://www.worldnavalships.com/leander_class1.htm www.worldnavalships.com Leander class  The Leander had three masts and two funnels; she was square-rigged on the fore-mast and gaff-rigged on the two masts behind the funnels.http://www.angloboerwarmuseum.com/Boer93i_ships.html Photos and a water colour of the Leander under sail in the Canadian Anglo-Boer War Museum  She was armed with ten 6-inch BL guns, 16 machineguns and four above-water torpedo-tubes.  Four of the machine guns were later replaced by four 3 pdr QFs.
After her sister ship HMS Phaeton 1883 Phaetons trials, the Leander had her funnels raised 6 ft to improve the draught to the boilers.  Once this was done, the Leander exceeded her designed speed.  She was the only one of her class to have forced draught. The Leander was a good steamer, but a poor sea-boat with a heavy roll in some sea conditions.
The December 1884 Navy List listed her as being at Chatham, with her commissioned and warrant officers borne in Pembroke as follows:

Seagoing career
1885-1889
On 29 May 1885, Captain Martin J Dunlop arrived on board at Chatham and commissioned the ship.http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ The Catalogue of the UK National Archives has logs for the Leander covering 29 May 1885 to 4 April 1889, catalogue references ADM 53/14282 to 14288  The first few days were spent first cleaning and then provisioning the ship.  On 3 June, they tested the flooding arrangements of the magazines and shell rooms and found they were correct.  On 5 June at 16:00, Leander was hauled out of the basin and proceeded under steam down the Medway in charge of the pilot and at 17:45 secured to the swinging buoy at Sheerness the engines using 5 tons 8 cwt of coal and the ship a further 3 cwt; no coal was used distilling.  One man fell overboard, and went on the sick list.  On 6 June they took on board powder, shot and shell, and 300 lbs of fresh beef and 200 lbs of vegetables.  On 8 June they swung the ship to adjust the compasses.  On 9 June, the ship went out for gunnery practice, burning 26 tons 5 cwt of coal for the engines and 6 cwt for the ship.  She fired 21 rounds from the 6-in BL; firing caused a number of breakages: 1 axial vent for a 6-in BL, the glass of two electric light projectors searchlights, and the Pawl of Compressor of Admiralty Carriage.Log of HMS Leander 29 May 1885  22 May 1886, UK National Archives file ADM 53/14282
Still secured to the buoy off Sheerness Dockyard, she received 90 lbs of fresh vegetables and 182 lbs fresh beef on 10 June.  On 11 June, she was inspected by the Commander-in-Chief.  Repairs in the engine room appeared to be complete by early afternoon, and fires were lighted in four boilers between 14:30 and 15:30; the ship prepared for sea, however soon after 18:00 a defect was found in the after centrifugal fan spindle in the engine room, so fires were banked.  Artificers worked all night to repair the defect.  Repairs in the engine room were completed by 17:00 on 12 June.  Fires were brought forward in the boilers, and at 19:00, the ship slipped and proceeded out under steam.  She proceeded to Portsmouth; travelling 154 nautical miles under steam burning 35 tons 18 cwt coal for the engines and 6 cwt for the ship.  At Portsmouth she saluted the saluted the admiral superintendent with 11 guns at 14:35.  On 15 June she stowed Whitehead torpedoes.  Some torpedoes were fired to test them.
On 16 June she proceeded to Berehaven  arriving on the evening of 17 June finding there the Royal Navy  Evolutionary Squadron 1885 Evolutionary Squadron consisting of HMS Minotaur 1863 Minotaur, HMS Hercules 1868 Hercules, HMS Agincourt 1865 Agincourt, HMS Sultan 1870 Sultan, HMS Polyphemus 1881 Polyphemus, HMS Devastation 1871 Devastation, HMS Iron Duke 1870 Iron Duke, HMS Hotspur 1870 Hotspur, HMS Lord Warden 1865 Lord Warden, HMS Repulse 1868 Repulse, HMS Shannon 1875 Shannon, HMS Ajax 1880 Ajax, HMS Penelope 1867 Penelope, HMS Hecla 1878 Hecla, HMS Rupert 1872 Rupert, HMS Cormorant 1877 Cormorant, HMS Conquest 1878 Conquest, HMS Mercury 1878 Mercury, HMS Racer 1884 Racer, HMS Mariner 1884 Mariner, HMS Hawke  Hawke.  At 1830 she saluted the flag of Geoffrey Hornby Admiral Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby with 17 guns.
Evolutionary Squadron was engaged in what became the first of the Victorian Royal Navy's annual manoeuvres. When the Leander joined on 17 June, she was attached to the ships blockading Berehaven.  On 18 June the weather was so stormy that all exercises were suspended... After sunset, the Conquest, Mercury, Leander, Racer, Cormorant and Mariner with the torpedo boats attached to them got under way top take up their position of observation outside the haven.  The weather proved so boisterous that the blocading division returned before it had reached the open water outside.  In returning... the Leander, while manoeuvring to keep clear of the Conquest, struck on the Hornet rock, and was seriously injured.  As soon as the accident occurred the engines were stopped, the watertight doors closed, the pumps were set going, and collision mats and sails were passed under the ship's bottom.  After some time it was found that e pumps failed to gain on the leak.  On the following day the ship was moved nearer the shore, so as to be ready to beach in case of necessity.  Early, however on the 21st the divers succeeded in finding the leak and stopping it with the patent leak-stopper.  The ship's hold was thereupon cleared of water.Lord Brassey, The Naval Annual 1886, pages 118-199.  It was not until 24 June that Leander was ready to go to sea again.  On 26 June, the Leander, escorted by the Mercury, arrived at Devonport, where she was placed in dock.  The damage to the Leader was described as follows: The sea entered through numerous rivet holes where rivets had been sheared, but the compartment kept the ship afloat in a working condition.Lord Brassey, The Naval Annual, 1886, page 199.  Amongst the stores destroyed by water were 168 lb of soft soap and 400 lb powder propellant for the guns.  The repairs to the ship cost 8,947.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1887/jul/18/supply-navy-estimates#S3V0317P0_18870718_HOC_172 Hansard HC Deb 18 July 1887 vol 317 c1208 and 1287 House of Commons, 18 July 1887Lord Randolph Churchill said: The Leander, built in 18856, was completed for 191,000; but in the same year the Admiralty spent 8,947 on her.Edward Field MP Admiral Edward Field replied: the noble Lord spoke of the Leander, of the great scandal of her costing within a short time of her construction over 8,000. Yes; but he did not tell the reason. Accidents will happen to ships as to other things; and an accident happened to that ship when she was with the Squadron on the Coast of Ireland. She ran upon a rock coming into Berehaven by the west entrance, and knocked a hole in her bottom. You do not suppose you could repair her for a mere nothing, and that sum represents the cost of the repairs of the ship after that accident.
After her brief service with the 1885 Evolutionary Squadron, the Leander served on the China Station.

1895-1897
The following account of the Leander's time in reserve and her refit was written at least 25 years after the event by a retired paymaster officer.  In some details this is at variance with the account in the Leander's logbook for 1897 see next section. 
:The Leander paid off at Chatham after many years in China in November 1895.  Naturally she was in a bad state, and the Dockyard officers reported her as only fit for C Division of the Reserve; that is to say, she required an extensive refit, which meant landing all her stores and stripping her. This was reported to the Controller Jacky Fisher Rear Admiral J.A. Fisher, and he wired back that the Leander was to be paid off into the A Division, meaning that no repairs were to be taken in hand, and that her name would appear in the list of ships ready for sea at forty-eight hours notice. As this was contrary to Regulations, besides being false, a further report was made to the Admiralty.  Fisher replied: 'If the dockyard offers will not do as I tell them, I will replace them by others who will.' The Leander paid off all standing, and I was ordered to keep her defect lists and reports of the survey until the Admiralty should be pleased to order them to be taken in hand. After some months actually 1897 Admiralty orders were received for the Leander to be commissioned by Captain Fegen for the Pacific.  We reported that she was unfit to go to sea until refitted.  The reply was that the Admiralty orders were to be obeyed.  The Leander did commission at Chatham.  She got as far as Portsmouth, where Sir Nowel Salmon was Commander-in-Chief, whom Fisher could not bully.  the result was that the Leander was detained at Portsmouth to have her necessary defects made good.  If anything had happened to her owing to her unseaworthy state, it would have been scandalous.
1897-1901
HMS Leander was commissioned by Captain FF Fegen at Chatham on Tuesday 8 June 1897.  On the morning on 11 June, she was moved to No 8 buoy Sheerness, where she was swung to measure the deviation of her magnetic compass.  On 16 June she was moved to No 4 Buoy in Little Nore, and the next day to the Downs off Deal.  At 2115 on 19 June she weighed anchor and proceeded to Spithead, where she arrived the next day.  She remained at Spithead until 2 July, and then went to Berehaven, arriving on 4th July.  She left Berehaven on 7 July, going to the rendezvous for manoeuvres.  She then stopped at Falmouth Harbour four hours on 11 July.  She had gunnery practice on 12th July, expending 25 6-in common shell, 5 6-in shrapnel, 10 6-in blanks, and 27 rounds of 3-pdr Hotchkiss.  She then returned to Sheerness arriving on 14 July.  On 20 July, dockyard hands started being employed on board each day, finishing on 9 August including weekends.  Typically the number of dockyard hands was between 11 and 22.  On 12 August she was reswung at Sheerness, and then she put to sea arriving at Plymouth the next day.  She remained at Plymouth until she sailed for Vigo on 19 August, arriving on 22 August.  She was again reswung off Vigo on 24 August 1897.She was next reswung off the coast of Peru on 14 June 1898.  She arrived at Valparaiso Chile on 28 October.  She had gunnery practice again in November 1897, expending 35 cast steel 6-in filled common shell, 5 iron 6-in filled shrapnel shells, 20 3-pdr, 78 cartridges saluting, 2 green very lights, and 1,120 rounds .45 machine gun ball cartridges.Ships Log HMS Leander, 8th June 1897 to 9th September 1898.

In 1900 she did good work during Thousand Days War a revolution in Panama in protecting the lives and property of foreign residents.http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Navy-a2.html New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, The Royal New Zealand Navy, Appendix II  Record of HMS LEANDER
1901-1904
In 1902 it was decided that Leander was obsolete as a cruiser and should be fitted as a dept ship for torpedo boat destroyershttp://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1906/oct/24/obsolete-war-ships#S4V0163P0_19061024_HOC_20 Hansard, HC Deb 24 October 1906 vol 163 cc179-83 Obsolete War-Ships in the Mediterranean.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1902/feb/21/new-construction#S4V0103P0_19020221_HOC_147 Hansard HC Deb 21 February 1902 vol 103 c739. New Construction. stated: the Leander, is now having her boilers replaced in order that she may contribute the very important and valuable service of supplying a torpedo base for the Mediterranean.  The Leander was reboilered as part of this refit.  On 2 May 1902 the Secretary of the Admiralty, H. O. Arnold-Forster Mr Arnold-Forster, was asked in the House of Commons about the choice of boilers.  The old boilers were cylindrical single-ended boilers fitted on in 1883.  The replacement boilers were of the same type, made by Messrs. J. Brown & Co. of Clydebank.http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?search=hms Hansard: HC Deb 02 May 1902 vol 107 c558William Allan UK politician Mr. William Allan Gateshead: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Admiralty if, seeing that H.M.S. Leander is to receive new boilers, he will state what type of boiler is being adopted, who were the manufacturers, what type of boiler is on her at present, and in what year were they fitted on board.H. O. Arnold-Forster Mr. Arnold-Forster: The old boilers of the Leander are to be replaced by single-ended cylindrical boilers. The boilers now being inserted are made by Messrs. J. Brown & Co. of Clydebank. The boilers which are being removed are also cylindrical single-ended boilers. They were fitted on board in 1883. Mr. William Allan: May I ask the hon. Gentleman why water tube boilers were not fitted in this ship, seeing that they are so much approved of? Mr. Arnold-Forster: Because the ship was built for cylindrical boilers, and no special purpose would be served by the installation of water-tube boilers in her case. The Leander's refit was again controversial.
1904-1920
The Leander was commissioned as a depot ship for torpedo boat destroyers by John de Robeck Captain John M de Robeck on 21 January 1904 presumably at Chatham.http://www.admirals.org.uk/admirals/fleet/derobeckjm.php www.admirals.org.uk Admiral Of The Fleet Sir John Michael De Robeck, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O.  She served as part of the Mediterranean Fleet.  On 1 June 1904, de Robeck left the ship as a result of being censured over Leander's refit. De Robeck was  put on half-pay.http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FDRBK Churchill Archives Centre catalogue: The Papers of Admiral Sir John de Robeck
