Alastis are a black metal band formed in 1987 in Sion, Switzerland.
Much like their fellow countrymen Samael, gothic and industrial musical elements played an important role in their sound during their later career, starting as a raw black metal before signing to Century Media records. Coincidentally, Samael's current vocalist/guitarist Vorph did vocals on the demo Black Wedding (1990), and Masmiseim (b. Christophe Mermod) had played bass for the group before joining Samael in 1992. Former Alastis drummer Acronoise (b. Laurent Mermod) is also Masmiseim's brother.1
Their last album was Unity, released in 2001. No press or news release has been available since, and sources differ widely as to the current status of the band.
