Local trains, called P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;g
There are six (unnumbered) lines in the P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;gen system, from Hyllie in southern Malm&lt;U+00F6&gt; to Helsingborg/&lt;U+00C4&gt;ngelholm (2 different paths), H&lt;U+00F6&gt;&lt;U+00F6&gt;r and Ystad/Simrishamn, and from Helsingborg to &lt;U+00C5&gt;storp and Kristianstad.

Regional trains, called &lt;U+00D6&gt;resundst&lt;U+00E5&gt;g (starting from Helsing&lt;U+00F8&gt;r)
The &lt;U+00D6&gt;resund Trains that cross the Oresund always depart from Elsinore, go via Copenhagen and the largest airport in Scandinavia, Kastrup, and serve as regional trains in Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;ne County and beyond. In Denmark, they serve as suburban trains on the Copenhagen commuter rail network, but not in Sweden, where they are semi-fast regional trains.

Facts
The lines are not numbered (yet). Some time tables may be numbered, but the numbers are not shown on the trains.
The regional train network are officially named &quot;&lt;U+00D6&gt;resundst&lt;U+00E5&gt;g&quot;.
The local train network are officially named &quot;P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;g&quot;.
These names are, however, also unofficially used for the train types (officially called X31, X11 and X61). Some &quot;&lt;U+00D6&gt;resundst&lt;U+00E5&gt;g&quot; vehicles (X31) runs as local &quot;P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;g&quot;, and others run as intercity trains, which is a bit confusing even for the locals.
A tunnel under Malm&lt;U+00F6&gt;, Citytunneln, was opened in December 2010.
The county has at present 54 stations, all tracks are electrified, but only half of the track length is dual track.
There are three different ticket systems, one for traveling inside the Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;ne county and another for traveling to the Copenhagen metropolitan area, and a third for &lt;U+00D6&gt;resundst&lt;U+00E5&gt;g to places north of Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;ne.
The ticket systems differ in the fare zones only, all tickets can be bought in machines at the stations.
Tickets for travel to other counties can be bought in machines at &lt;U+00D6&gt;resundst&lt;U+00E5&gt;g stations, through SJ, or through the internet; the same applies to travel to Denmark outside the Copenhagen metropolitan area.
DSB and SJ have their own separate ticket systems, not compatible with the Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;netrafiken system. SJ can sell tickets for Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;netrafiken trains.
Typically trains on local lines run every hour and the regional lines twice every hour.
There is a bug in the ticketing system when buying with a discount (Jojo) card, and a different origin station is specified. This can occur if the passenger holds a 'period' card (weekly or monthly pass) for part of the route. If the passenger buys a ticket from Malm&lt;U+00F6&gt; to Kastrup, but from a Lund station ticket vending machine, the passenger will be charged the non-discounted price. The counter staff will credit the passenger's card with the difference, on presentation of the ticket.
Rolling stock
The P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;g rolling stock is owned by Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;netrafiken, although the operation (staff and licences etc.) is carried out by Arriva.
Most P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;g trains are of type X11 but demand has grown, necessitating the addition of other available train types to the roster. Some Bombardier Regina type train sets have been rented from other train owners. The type X31, normally used for the Oresundtrain traffic to Denmark, is also used sometimes. Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;netrafiken has ordered 49 new Alstom Coradia/X61 sets, a variant of the type used in Stockholm. Several of them have been used on revenue services since August 2010. Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;netrafiken plans to sell most of the X11 trains during 2011, and use the X61 trains as P&lt;U+00E5&gt;gat&lt;U+00E5&gt;g. The X11 trains do not fulfill all the safety requirements for the City tunnel and have a temporary exception from the rules.
The rolling stock for Oresundtrain is of type X31 only, and these trains are owned by the &lt;U+00D6&gt;resundst&lt;U+00E5&gt;g company, partially owned by Sk&lt;U+00E5&gt;netrafiken.
