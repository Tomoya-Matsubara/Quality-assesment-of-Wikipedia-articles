This England is the classical music album by the Oregon Symphony under the artistic direction of Carlos Kalmar, released by Dutch record label PentaTone Classics in November 2012. The album was recorded at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon at five performances in February and May 2012. It contains works by three English 20th-century composers: Edward Elgar's Cockaigne (In London Town), Ralph Vaughan Williams' Symphony No. 5, and &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; and &quot;Passacaglia&quot; from Benjamin Britten's opera Peter Grimes. The recording marked the orchestra's second under Kalmar's leadership, following the highly successful Music for a Time of War (2011), which also included works by Britten and Vaughan Williams and received Grammy Award nominations for Best Orchestral Performance and Best Engineered Album, Classical. This England received positive critical reception but failed to chart.
Background and composition
This England, released through the Dutch record label PentaTone Classics on November 13, 2012,12 contains compositions by three English 20th-century composers: Cockaigne (In London Town) by Edward Elgar, Symphony No. 5 by Ralph Vaughan Williams, and &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; and &quot;Passacaglia&quot; from the opera Peter Grimes (1945) by Benjamin Britten. The album contains ten tracks, with works divided into separate tracks for each movement and interlude. The works were recorded live at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon at five performances in February and May 2012.3 Symphony No. 5 and Cockaigne were performed February 18&lt;U+2013&gt;19 as part of the program &quot;Kahane Plays Mozart&quot;;&quot;Kahane Plays Mozart&quot;:
 the works by Britten were performed May 12&lt;U+2013&gt;14 as part of the program &quot;Arnaldo Cohen Plays Tchaikovsky&quot;.&quot;Arnaldo Cohen Plays Tchaikovsky&quot;:
 In his review of the February 18th performance, The Oregonian{{'s}} James McQuillen noted disturbances from the audience, including coughing and the ringing of one attendant's cell phone.4 McQuillen suggested the disturbances could be removed from the audio by engineers if the February 19th recording was not preferable.5
The album marked the second recorded during Kalmar's tenure, following the highly successful Music for a Time of War (2011),6 which also included works by Britten and Vaughan Williams and received Grammy Award nominations for Best Orchestral Performance and Best Engineered Album, Classical.789 The recording is the second of four albums to be produced by the Symphony and PentaTone before the end of the 2014&lt;U+2013&gt;2015 season,1011 all under Kalmar's artistic leadership.12 Like Music for a Time of War, This England was recorded in hybrid multichannel (surround sound) Super Audio CD format.1314 Blanton Alspaugh served as producer. Alspaugh and John Newton were the recording engineers, and mixing and mastering was conducted by Mark Donahue.15 In addition to recording the performances, the Boston-based company Soundmirror edited, mixed and mastered the audio.16 Program notes for the recording were written by Steven Kruger.17 The album's cover art was designed by David McLaughlin, art director for the Symphony.18
The Symphony celebrated the recording by hosting a CD release party in late October.19
Works
Elgar conducted the world premiere of Cockaigne (In London Town) at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at Queen's Hall in London in June 1901.20 The work has been described as an &quot;unashamedly populist portrait of 'old London town'&quot; and a musical description of the city at the turn of the century, with references to whistling boys, strolling lovers and marching bands.2122 The Oregon Symphony last performed the overture in January 1990, under Norman Leyden. The work, which is approximately 15 minutes in length, employs bassoon, clarinet, contrabassoon, cornet, flute, horn, oboe, percussion, piccolo, timpani, trombone, trumpet, tuba and strings.23
Symphony No. 5 was composed during 1936&lt;U+2013&gt;1943 and premiered in June 1943 with Vaughan Williams conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Royal Albert Hall in London.24 The widely performed work evokes serenity and pastoral settings, despite being completed during World War II, as its origins began as an opera in the 1930s.2526 The symphony, which is approximately 41 minutes in length, contains four movements (&quot;Preludio&quot;, &quot;Scherzo&quot;, &quot;Romanza&quot; and &quot;Passacaglia&quot;) and includes bassoon, clarinet, English horn, flute, horn, oboe, piccolo, timpani, trombone, trumpet and strings. The Oregon Symphony's February 2012 performances marked the first for Symphony No. 5.27
The recording continues with Britten's &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; and &quot;Passacaglia&quot;. The four interludes (&quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Sunday morning&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;) have been published separately as Opus 33a; &quot;Passacaglia&quot; has also been published separately as Opus 33b. Peter Grimes premiered on June 7, 1945 at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London, conducted by Reginald Goodall. On June 13, Britten conducted the four interludes with the London Philharmonic in Cheltenham; Adrian Boult conducted &quot;Passacaglia&quot; with the BBC Symphony Orchestra on August 29.28 Prior to 2012, the Oregon Symphony's most recent performance of &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; was in 1993 under James DePreist, and the orchestra had never presented &quot;Passacaglia&quot;. The interludes and &quot;Passacaglia&quot; are approximately 16 minutes and 7 minutes, respectively, and include bass drum, bassoon, bells, celeste, clarinet, cymbals, contrabassoon, flute, gong, harp, horn, oboe, piccolo, snare drum, tam tam, tambourine, tenor drum, timpani, trombone, trumpet, tuba, xylophone and strings.29
Reception
This England received positive critical reception. David Patrick Stearns of Philadelphia Daily News awarded the album 3.5 out of 4 stars and, also referring to the success of Music for a Time of War, wrote that the repertoire has &quot;perfectly wide appeal, especially in vital, muscular performances such as these&quot;.30 Stearns, who appreciated Kalmar's balance of technicality and the music's &quot;exterior atmosphere&quot;, called the performances &quot;thoughtful&quot; and &quot;incisive&quot;. He also noted the originality of the interludes and &quot;Passacaglia&quot; from Peter Grimes, claiming they &quot;won't be mistaken for anybody else's.&quot;31 In his review for The Huffington Post, Brian Horay wrote that the orchestra delivered &quot;knockout&quot; and &quot;beefy-yet-restrained&quot; performances of the Peter Grimes compositions.32 Referring to This England and its preceding album, which featured Sinfonia da Requiem, Horay said the recordings &quot;showcase Kalmar and his band as supreme interpreters of Benjamin Britten's amazingly colorful brand of orchestral anxiety, inviting the listener to delve ever deeper into painful, yet rewarding, symphonic ambivalence.&quot;33 Classical CD Review's Robert Benson called the Elgar performance &quot;brilliant&quot; and appreciated that &quot;Passacaglia&quot; was programmed before &quot;The Storm&quot;.34 Benson complimented Kalmar (calling him a &quot;conductor to watch&quot;) as well as the sound of the recording, describing it as &quot;well-balanced orchestral sound, with a wide dynamic range&quot;.35 He noted the lack of audience interference with the sound and assured audiophiles would appreciate the quality.36 Steven Ritter of Audiophile Audition wrote that the Symphony performed &quot;with a brilliance and verve equal to any on record&quot; and were &quot;entirely attuned to the 'English' idiom&quot;.37 Ritter complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for the performances and opined: &quot;Who knew Oregon could sound like this? PentaTone should hold on to this bunch as long as they can, and explore as much repertory as they can handle. Great sound, performances, and production!&quot;38
Several Oregon publications included This England on their lists highlighting local products. Portland Monthly included the album on their list of &quot;November's Best PDX Stuff&quot;, which showcases Portland's &quot;coolest products and ideas&quot;.39 The Oregonian included the album on their list of &quot;25 local gifts under $25&quot;.40 Oregon ArtsWatch contributor Brett Campbell recommended the album on his list of Oregon classical music &quot;stocking stuffers&quot;. Campbell wrote that, despite the acoustic limitations of the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, the live recordings &quot;achieve admirable depth and clarity that bring out unexpected elements in both major 20th century English compositions&quot;.41 Furthermore, he complimented Kalmar and the orchestra for their &quot;tightly wound expressiveness&quot; and &quot;sharp&quot; performances, and said their recording of Cockaigne can &quot;proudly stand alongside other top versions by the likes of the London Symphony Orchestra&quot;.42
The Portland Mercury invited local music industry professionals to list &quot;Portland's Top Five Records of 2012&quot;; the reviewer known as &quot;Angry Symphony Guy&quot; (Brian Horay)43 included This England at the top of his list.44 The CBC Radio 2 program &quot;In Concert&quot; designated the album as the Disc of the Week for the week of January 7, 2013.45 In her review, Denise Ball said of the recording, &quot;the sound is vivid and fresh, and the orchestra plays with remarkable depth of colour and rhythmic drive.&quot;46
KQAC offered the album as a thank you gift to donors of a certain level during a 2012 fundraising campaign.4748
