June Lascelles (23 January 1924 &lt;U+2013&gt; 15 July 2004) was an Australian microbiologist. She is best known for pioneering work in microbial photosynthesis.
Early life
June was born and raised in Sydney, Australia. She attended the University of Sydney and received a BSc in Biochemistry in 1944. She remained there as a research scholar and teaching fellow and later, a Linnaean Maceay fellow, receiving her MSc in 1947.1
Scientific career
Lascelles began her research in microbiology, a field in which she remained for her entire career. Her initial research was focused on the metabolism of molecular hydrogen in E. coli. She excelled in her work; so much so that in 1947 she was awarded the prestigious Royal Exhibition of 1851 Overseas Research Fellowship. She chose to move to the UK, joining the microbiology unit of the biochemistry lab at Oxford University under Donald Devereux Woods. Here, Lascelles made several important contributions to the field of microbiology, especially in the metabolism and synthesis of enzymes in bacteria.2 Lascelles and William R. Sistron were credited with applying the emerging technology of pre-molecular genetics to the biosynthesis of the pigments called bacteriochlorophyll.3 In 1979 she became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California.4
She was awarded her D.Phil in 1952, and continued her work at Oxford. In 1956, she was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, and went to Stanford University for a year to work with C. B. van Niel at the Hopkins Marine Station.5 Van Niel was legendary in his knowledge of microorganism biology, and this experience afforded Lascelles a great many experiences; especially the ability to study more exotic bacterial organisms. The work she did during this period contributed to several impressive discoveries such as dispelling the previously-thought rule that anaerobes do not have cytochromes, and the provision of a soluble &lt;U+03B2&gt;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which allowed Krebs&lt;U+2019&gt; group to devise a now widely-used assay for ketone bodies.6
In 1960, she was appointed University Lecturer in Microbiology at Oxford, a post she held until 1965. In 1964, while on a year&lt;U+2019&gt;s leave, she became a visiting Professor of Bacteriology at UCLA; a role which was made permanent in 1965. These years were some of the most productive in her career, and her work provided the basis of understanding of tetrapyrrole synthesis in photosynthetic bacteria which holds tested and true even today.7
Honours and awards
Lascelles was a member of the Biochemical Society from 1947-2002 and served on the Biochemical Journal editorial board from 1959-1966.8 She also served on the editorial boards of the Journal of Bacteriology, the Journal of General Microbiology and the Archives of Microbiology.9 In 1990 she was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.10 Additionally, she was one of the editors in the 1973 book Microbial Photosynthesis.11
Later life and death
Lascelles retired in 1989, but continued to work daily until two years before her death. She was a private and modest woman, but always forthright and plain speaking. She is best remembered for her generosity to young scientists, being approachable and giving wise council. Upon her passing, she was described by a colleague as &lt;U+201C&gt;an accomplished scholar, dedicated learner, highly respected experimentalist, unique role model and rare friend&lt;U+201D&gt;.12
