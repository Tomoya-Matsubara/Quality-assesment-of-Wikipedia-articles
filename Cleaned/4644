2-Ethylhexanol (abbreviated 2-EH) is a fatty alcohol, an organic compound is a branched, eight-carbon chiral alcohol. It is a colorless liquid that is nearly insoluble in water but soluble in most organic solvents. It is produced on a massive scale as a precursor to plasticizers, some of which are controversial as potential endocrine disruptors.
Applications
Almost all 2-ethylhexanol is converted into the diesters bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer. Because it is a fatty alcohol, its esters tend to have emollient properties. For example, the sunscreen octocrylene contains a 2-ethylhexyl ester for this purpose. It is also commonly used as a low volatility solvent.
Industrial production
2-Ethylhexanol is produced industrially by the aldol condensation of n-butyraldehyde, followed by hydrogenation of the resulting hydroxyaldehyde. About 2,500,000 tons are prepared in this way annually.12 The n-butyraldehyde is made by hydroformylation of propylene, either in a self-contained plant or as the first step in a fully integrated facility. Most facilities make n-butanol and isobutanol in addition to 2-ethylhexanol.
Nomenclature
Isooctanol and 2-ethylhexanol are not synonyms. According to the Chemical Abstracts Service, isooctanol (CAS# 26952-21-6) refers to a different isomer of octanol, 6-methylheptan-1-ol.
