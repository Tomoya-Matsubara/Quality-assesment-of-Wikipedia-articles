The foundation's logo.
TED (short for Technology, Entertainment, Design) is a U.S. private non-profit foundation1 that is best known for its conferences, now held in Europe and Asia as well as the U.S., devoted to what it calls &quot;ideas worth spreading.&quot;2 Its lectures or TED Talks, widely disseminated on the Internet, are subject to an eighteen-minute time limit.
TED was founded in 1984 as a one-off event, and the conference was held annually from 1990. TED's early emphasis, consistent with a Silicon Valley center of gravity, was largely technology and design. Its co-founder was Richard Saul Wurman, credited with having coined in 1976 the term information architect. As popularity of the talks has spread, so has the range of subject matter, to cover almost all aspects of science and culture. Those who have given TED talks include Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, the founders of Google and various Nobel Prize winners.3
TED's curator is the British former computer journalist and magazine publisher Chris Anderson. It is owned by the Sapling Foundation.
From 2005 to 2009, three $100,000 TED Prizes were awarded annually to help its winners realize a chosen &quot;wish to change the world.&quot; Starting in 2010, however, only one winner has been selected to ensure that TED can maximize its efforts of achieving the winner's wish. Each winner unveils their wish at the main annual conferencewithin the specified 18 minutes.
Background
   The TED staff is headquartered in New York City and Vancouver. The conference had been held in Monterey, California, since its founding, but since 2009 has been held in Long Beach, California, due to an increased number of attendees.4 The TED conference also has a companion conference, TEDGlobal, held in varying locations. Last year, TEDGlobal 2009, &quot;The Substance of Things Not Seen,&quot; was held in Oxford, UK, July 21&lt;U+2013&gt;24, 2009. The most recent event was TED 2010, &quot;What the World Needs Now,&quot; in Long Beach, California, February 9&lt;U+2013&gt;13, 2010.5
More than 700 TED talks are provided for free viewing online. , talks had been viewed over 250 million times by more than 25 million people.
TED's mission statement begins:
We believe passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and ultimately, the world. So we're building here a clearinghouse that offers free knowledge and inspiration from the world's most inspired thinkers, and also a community of curious souls to engage with ideas and each other.6
Attendees of TED are called &quot;TEDsters&quot;.
History
TED was founded by Richard Saul Wurman and Harry Marks in 1984, and has been held annually since 1990. Wurman left after the 2002 conference; the event is now hosted by Chris Anderson and owned by his non-profit organization, The Sapling Foundation,7 devoted to &quot;leveraging the power of ideas to change the world&quot;. In 2006, attendance cost $4,400 and was by invitation only.8 The membership model was shifted in January 2007 to an annual membership fee of $6,000, which includes attendance of the conference, club mailings, networking tools and conference DVDs.
Since June 2006, TED Talks have been made available online on the TED website, YouTube, iTunes,91011 and since late 2009, there has been a free iPhone app.12 The TED website recently won the Webby Award for Best Use of Video or Moving Image at the 13th Annual Webby Awards.13 TED Talks are transcribed and translated into a number of languages as part of the TED Open-Translation Project, which aims to &quot;[reach] out to the 4.5 billion people on the planet who don't speak English,&quot; according to TED Curator Chris Anderson. At the time of the launch, over 300 translations were done by volunteer transcribers in over 40 languages.14

TED Prize
The TED Prize was introduced in 2005. In previous years, three individuals were each given $100,000 and granted a &quot;wish to change the world&quot;, which they unveil at TED. However, starting in 2010, only one prize is awarded since &quot;at least half of [the wishes] still require our engagement,&quot; and, &quot;adding too many more risks dilution of effort.&quot;15
