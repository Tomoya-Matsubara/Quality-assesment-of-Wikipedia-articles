Stephen Robert Pate (born May 26, 1961) is an American professional golfer who has played on both the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour.
Pate was born in Ventura, California. He attended UCLA and was a member of the golf team. He helped lead the team to the 1983 Pac-10 Championship, and earned All-American honors that year. He turned pro and joined the PGA Tour later that year.
Pate has won six PGA Tour events. His first victory was at the 1987 Southwest Golf Classic; and his most recent win was at the 1998 CVS Charity Classic. His best years in professional golf were 1988 when he won twice and finished 12th on the money list; and 1991, when he had five top-3 finishes including a win at the Honda Classic, earned $727,997 and finished 6th on the money list. 1 His best finish in a major is a T-3 at both the 1988 U.S. Open and the 1991 Masters.

As he entered his forties, he began to split his playing time between the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour.2 His best finish on the Nationwide Tour has been a T-10 at the 2002 Greater Richmond Open. He lives in Agoura Hills, California. He acquired the nickname &quot;Volcano&quot; due to his temper.3
