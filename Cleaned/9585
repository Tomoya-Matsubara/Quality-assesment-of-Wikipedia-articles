Throughout this article, the unqualified use of currency denominations such as &quot;$&quot; or &quot;&lt;U+00A3&gt;&quot; generally refers to play money in the context of the game.
Monopoly is the best-selling commercial board game in the world. Players compete to acquire wealth through stylized economic activity involving the buying, rental and trading of properties using play money, as players take turns moving around the board according to the roll of the dice. The game is named after the economic concept of monopoly, the domination of a market by a single seller.
According to Hasbro, since Charles Darrow patented the game in 1935, approximately 750 million people have played the game, making it &quot;the most played [commercial] board game in the world.&quot;1 The 1999 Guinness Book of Records cited Hasbro's previous statistic of 500 million people having played Monopoly2. Games Magazine has inducted Monopoly into its Hall of Fame3.
History
The history of Monopoly can be traced back to the early 1900s. In 1904, an inventor named Lizzie Magie patented a game through which she hoped to be able to explain some of the economic ideas of Henry George. Her game, The Landlord's Game, was commercially published a few years later. Magie's game was redeveloped by her, and other interested game players, many of whom made their own sets. Magie herself patented a revised edition of the game in 1924, and similar games were published commercially. By the early 1930s a board game named Monopoly was created much like the version of Monopoly sold by Parker Brothers and its parent companies through the rest of the 20th century, and into the 21st. Several different people, mostly in the U.S. Midwest and near the U.S. East Coast, contributed to the game's design and evolution.
By the 1970s, the game's early history had been lost (and at least one historian has argued that it was purposely suppressed - see below), and the idea that it had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore, printed in the game's instructions, and even the 1974 book The Monopoly Book: Strategy and Tactics of the World's Most Popular Game, by Maxine Brady. As Professor Ralph Anspach fought Parker Brothers and their then parent company, General Mills, over the trademarks of the Monopoly board game, much of the early history of the game was &quot;rediscovered.&quot;
Because of the lengthy court process, and appeals, the legal status of Parker Brothers' trademarks on the game was not settled until the mid-1980s. The game's name remains a registered trademark of Parker Brothers, as do its specific design elements. Parker Brothers current corporate parent, Hasbro, again only acknowledges the role of Charles Darrow in the creation of the game. Anspach published a book about his researches, called The Billion Dollar Monopoly Swindle, in which he makes his case about the purposeful suppression of the game's early history and development.
Board
Atlantic City version
This is the original and classic version produced by Parker Brothers. The board consists of 40 squares, containing 28 properties, 3 &quot;Chance&quot; squares, 3 &quot;Community Chest&quot; squares, a &quot;Luxury Tax&quot; square, an &quot;Income Tax&quot; square, &quot;GO&quot;, &quot;Jail&quot;, &quot;Free Parking&quot;, and &quot;Go To Jail.&quot; In the U.S. version shown below, the properties are named after locations in (or near) Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Landing on the Jail space by a direct roll of the dice (without being sent to Jail) in the corner between the Light Blue and Light Purple/Maroon properties means you are &quot;Just Visiting&quot; and continue the next turn normally.
Note that Marvin Gardens, a Yellow property on the above board, is actually a misspelling of the original location name, Marven Gardens. Marven Gardens is not a street, but a housing area outside Atlantic City. The housing area is said to be derived from MARgate City and VENtnor City in New Jersey (emphasis added). The misspelling was originally introduced by Charles Todd, whose home-made Monopoly board was copied by Charles Darrow and subsequently used as the basis of their design by Parker Brothers. It was not until 1995 that Parker Brothers acknowledged this mistake and formally apologized to the residents of Marven Gardens for the misspelling. 4
Illinois Avenue was renamed Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. in Atlantic City sometime during the 1980s. States Avenue and Saint Charles Place no longer exist, as the Showboat Casino Hotel was developed where they once ran.5
Short Line is believed to refer to the Shore Fast Line, a streetcar line that served Atlantic City. 6 The B&amp;O Railroad did not serve Atlantic City. A booklet included with the reprinted 1935 edition states that the four railroads that served Atlantic City in the mid-1930s were the Jersey Central, the Seashore Lines, the Reading Railroad, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Finally, Atlantic City does not have a Water Works &lt;U+2014&gt; its water is piped in from the New Jersey &quot;mainland&quot; through two pipes.
The other versions of the game have different property names, and the prices may be denominated in another currency, but the game mechanics are almost identical. The income tax choice from the U.S. version is replaced by a flat rate in the UK version, and the $75 Luxury Tax square is replaced with the &lt;U+00A3&gt;100 Super Tax square. The same is true of current German boards, with a &lt;U+20AC&gt;200 for the Income Tax space on the board, and a &lt;U+20AC&gt;100 Zusatzsteuer (Add-on tax) in place of the Luxury Tax. To complicate matters further, an Austrian version, released by Parker Brothers/Hasbro in 2001, does allow for the 10% or &lt;U+20AC&gt;200 for Income Tax and has a &lt;U+20AC&gt;100 Luxury Tax.
London version
In the 1930s, John Waddington Ltd. (Waddingtons) was a firm of printers from Leeds that had begun to branch out into packaging and the production of playing cards. Waddingtons had sent the card game Lexicon to Parker Brothers hoping to interest them in publishing the game in the United States. In a similar fashion Parker Brothers sent over a copy of Monopoly to Waddingtons early in 1935 before the game had been put into production in the United States.
The managing director of Waddingtons, Victor Watson, gave the game to his son Norman (who was head of the card games division) to test over the weekend. Norman was impressed by the game and persuaded his father to call Parker Brothers on Monday morning. This call resulted in Waddingtons obtaining a license to produce and market the game outside of the United States. Watson felt that in order for the game to be a success in Britain the American locations would have to be replaced, so Victor and his secretary, Marjory Phillips, went to London to scout out locations. The Angel, Islington is not a street in London but an area of North London named after a coaching inn that stood on the Great North Road. By the 1930s the inn had become a Lyons Corner House (it is now a Co-operative Bank). Some accounts say that Marjory and Victor met at the Angel to discuss the selection and celebrated the fact by including it on the Monopoly board. In 2003, a plaque commemorating the naming, was unveiled at the site by Victor Watson's grandson who is also named Victor.
The standard British board, produced by Waddingtons, was for many years the version most familiar to people in countries in the Commonwealth (except Canada, where the U.S. edition with Atlantic City-area names was reprinted), although local variants of the board are now also found in several of these countries such as New Zealand (see Localized versions of the Monopoly game).
In the cases where the game was produced under license by a national company, the &lt;U+00A3&gt; (pound) was replaced by a $ (dollar) sign, but the place names were unchanged.
For a list of some of the localized versions, including the UK &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; edition, and the names of their properties, see localized versions of the Monopoly game.
Here and Now Editions
United Kingdom: In 2005, Hasbro launched the UK version of the &quot;Here &amp; Now Limited Edition&quot;, updating the properties and prices to reflect present-day London properties. The playing pieces were also changed to be: Mobile phone, Roller blade, Hamburger, Jumbo Jet, Racing Car, Skateboard and London Bus. This version was launched in recognition of the game's 70th anniversary in conjunction with an online version.
United States: The U.S. version of the &quot;Here and Now Edition&quot; replaces Atlantic City landmarks with legendary U.S. streets, neighborhoods and national monuments. Fans were able to vote on the U.S. Monopoly website for their favorite landmarks from 22 cities &lt;U+2014&gt; including New York's Times Square, Chicago's Wrigley Field, Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive, Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, Phoenix's Camelback Mountain, and San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. Additionally, the votes determined where each landmark appears on the game board; the city with the most votes landing on the coveted Boardwalk spot. The railroads were replaced by airports, namely, New York's JFK, Chicago's O'Hare, Los Angeles' LAX and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson. Property values have been increased, money is in higher denominations, and the Community Chest and Chance cards reflect more modern scenarios. Tokens in the new game include a box of McDonald's French fries, a cup of Starbucks coffee, a Toyota Prius, a New Balance tennis shoe, and a Motorola Razr cellular phone.7
Germany: A German edition (called &quot;Monopoly Heute&quot; or &quot;Monopoly Today&quot;) was released in 2005, with updated properties in Berlin.
French: The French edition (called &quot;Monopoly - Nouveau plateau&quot;) was released in 2005, with updated properties in Paris.
Debit Card versions: A &quot;Here and Now Electronic Banking Edition&quot; has been released in England which includes an ATM and Visa debit cards in place of paper money.8 A similar edition is available in Germany and France where they are known as &quot;Monopoly Banking&quot; and &quot;Monopoly Electronique&quot; respectively.
Properties in detail
This list details the 22 real estate properties in the original American version of Monopoly as presented by Darrow to Parker Brothers. The Original Atlantic City Monopoly board was done by Hoskin/Raiford's Atlantic City Quaker Friends School teachers with the changes noted by starred [*] items. The bracketed items are the differences in the names on the Hoskin/Raiford Quaker Monopoly board. It is believed that a version copied from this school's edition by Charles Todd was in turn copied by Charles Darrow, duplicating the changes in names, and the infamous misspelling of Marven Gardens.

The four railroads/stations (Reading Railroad, Pennsylvania Railroad, B&amp;O Railroad, and Short Line/Kings Cross, Marylebone, Fenchurch St, Liverpool St) are each worth 200. Rent is based on the number of railroads that player owns: 25 for one, 50 for two, 100 for three, and 200 for all four. Each railroad has a mortgage value of 100.
The two utilities (Electric Company and Water Works) are each worth 150. If a player owns either, rent is equal to the amount shown on the dice times 4. If a player owns both, rent is equal to the amount shown on the dice times 10. Each utility has a mortgage value of 75.
Equipment
All twelve tokens from the U.S. Deluxe Edition Monopoly.
Each player is represented by a small pewter token which is moved around the edge of the board according to the roll of two dice. The twelve playing pieces currently used are pictured to the left and are as follows (from left to right): a wheelbarrow, a battleship, a sack of money (1999 editions onwards), a horse and rider, a car, a train (Deluxe Edition only), a thimble, a cannon, an old boot, a Scottie dog, an iron, and a top hat.
Many of the tokens came from companies such as Dowst Miniature Toy Company, which made metal charms and tokens designed to be used on charm bracelets. The battleship and cannon were also used briefly in the Parker Brothers war game Conflict (released in 1940), but after the game failed on the market, the premade pieces were recycled into Monopoly usage.9 Hasbro recently adopted the battleship and cannon for Diplomacy.
Early localized editions of the standard edition (including some Canadian editions, which used the U.S. board layout) did not include pewter tokens but instead had generic wooden head-shaped tokens identical to those in Sorry! (not unlike the MSN Messenger logo).10 Parker Brothers also acquired Sorry! in the 1930s. Plastic versions of these tokens can be seen in the German Monopoly set pictured at the beginning of this article. 
Other things included in the standard edition are: 
A pair of six-sided dice.
A Title Deed for each property. A Title Deed is given to a player to signify ownership, and specifies purchase price, mortgage value, the cost of building houses and hotels on that property, and the various rent prices depending on how developed the property is. Properties include:
22 streets, divided into 8 color groups of two or three streets. A player must own all of a color group (have a monopoly) in order to build houses or hotels. A player can also be considered to have a monopoly by having both utilities and/or all four railroads (or stations) during gameplay. However, the utilities and railroads cannot be improved or have houses and/or hotels built on them.
4 railways/stations. Players collect higher rent if they own more than one railway. Hotels and houses cannot be built on railways. These are usually replaced by railway stations in non-U.S. editions of Monopoly.
2 utilities. Players collect higher rent if they own both utilities. Hotels and houses cannot be built on utilities.
A supply of paper money. The supply of money is theoretically unlimited; if the bank runs out of money the players must make do with other markers, or calculate on paper. Additional paper money can be bought at certain locations, notably game and hobby stores. In U.S. standard editions, the supply generally starts with $15,140, the same amount given away in United States dollars to the winner of the quadrennial Monopoly World Championship.11
32 wooden or plastic houses and 12 wooden or plastic hotels. (The original and the current 'Deluxe Edition' have wooden houses and hotels; the current 'base set' uses plastic buildings.) Unlike money, houses and hotels have a finite supply. If no more are available, no substitute is allowed.
A deck of 16 Chance cards and a deck of 16 Community Chest cards. Players draw these cards when they land on the corresponding squares of the track, and follow the instructions printed on them.
Hasbro also sells a Deluxe Edition, which is mostly identical to the classic edition but has wooden houses and hotels and gold-toned tokens, including one token in addition to the standard eleven: a railroad locomotive. Other additions to the Deluxe Edition include a card carousel, which holds the title deed cards, and money printed with two colors of ink.
In 1978, retailer Neiman Marcus manufactured and sold an all-Chocolate edition of Monopoly through their &quot;Christmas Wish Book&quot; for that year. The entire set was edible, including the money, dice, hotels, properties, tokens and playing board. The set retailed for US$600. 12
The F.A.O. Schwarz store in New York City sold a custom version in 2000 called &quot;One-of-a-kind Monopoly&quot; for US$100,000. 13 This special edition comes in a locking attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; case made with Napolino leather and lined in suede, and features include:
18-carat (75%) gold tokens, houses and hotels
Rosewood board
street names written in gold leaf
emeralds around the Chance icon
sapphires around the Community Chest
rubies in the brake lights of the car on the Free Parking Space
the money is real, negotiable United States currency
The Guinness Book of World Records states that a set made of 23-carat gold, with rubies and sapphires atop the chimneys of the houses and hotels, and worth US$2,000,000 is the most expensive Monopoly set ever produced. 14
Rules
Two to eight people may play Monopoly, but the game dynamics are ideal with six players. With more than six players, it is too likely that an individual will not have the opportunity to buy significant property and be bankrupted without ever having been in contention. With four or fewer players, there are not as many possible combinations of property ownership, and the importance of astute trading and negotiation is diminished.
Each player begins the game with his token on the Go square, and $1500 (&lt;U+00A3&gt;1500, &lt;U+20AC&gt;1500, etc.) in cash divided as follows, per the U.S. standard rules:
2 each of:
$500 bills
$100 bills and
$50 bills
6 $20 bills
5 each of:
$10 bills
$5 bills
$1 bills
The British version has an initial cash distribution of:
2 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;500
4 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;100
1 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;50
1 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;20
2 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;10
1 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;5
5 x &lt;U+00A3&gt;1
All property deeds, houses, and hotels are held by the bank until bought by the players.
Official rules
Players take turns in order, as determined by chance before the game. A player's turn consists of rolling two dice and advancing on the board the corresponding number of squares clockwise around the track. Depending on where he/she lands, he/she takes any of a number of actions. If he or she lands on an unowned property, then the player has two options. He or she can either buy the property for its listed purchase price, or he or she can put it up for auction. The same goes for Railroads and utilities. If a person lands on Chance or Community Chest, then he or she draws the top card from the respective pile. If the player rolls doubles, he or she rolls again after completing the first turn, but if the player rolls three doubles in a row, he/she is sent to jail. If the player lands on a owned property he or she pays the owner a set amount of rent on colored properties and railroads, or multiplies a dice roll by a certain factor for the utilities. The player can also buy houses for their property if he/she owns all the property in a color group. The rent increases the more houses are on a space. Once there are four houses on a space, the player can build a hotel. The construction or selling back of houses and hotels must be done evenly across all properties in a color group. This means that each property must have first received one house before a second can be constructed, two houses before a third can be constructed, and so on.
House rules
Many casual Monopoly players are surprised and disappointed to discover that some of the rules they are used to are not part of the official rules. Many of these house rules tend to make the game longer by giving some players more money. Some common house rules include the following (and more can be found via links at the end of this article):
Free Parking jackpot, which usually consists of an initial stake (typically $500) plus collections of fines and taxes otherwise paid to the bank. A player who lands on Free Parking wins the jackpot, which may then be reset with the initial stake (if any). The jackpot is usually put in the center of the board.
Players in jail cannot collect rent, build house or conduct trades.
A bonus for landing directly on GO (commonly an additional $200).
Delayed Start: Players must pass GO before they can buy property.
Not having an auction when a player lands on a property and does not buy it.
Unlimited houses and hotels. A variant on this is to declare that houses cost $50 each, and hotels cost $100 each.
The fourth house step in building is skipped. In other words, after building a third house, the next step is building a hotel.
No need to build houses and hotels evenly over monopolized properties.
A $686 bonus for rolling snake eyes (a pair of ones). $686 is one of each bill.
Properties are auctioned as soon as they are landed on, without the chance for the player who landed on the property to buy it outright. This is actually carried over from &quot;auction monopoly&quot; rules that were popular in the 1920s.
All properties are handed out evenly to all players before the game begins, or one or two are dealt to each player.
No income tax on weekends and after 4 p.m. because the &quot;income tax office&quot; is closed.
A 'get out of jail free' card means that you can stay where you are on the board.
No need to roll a double when in jail.
House rules, while unofficial, are not wholly unrecognized by Parker Brothers. George S. Parker himself created two variants, to shorten the length of game play. Video game and computer game versions of Monopoly have options where popular house rules can be used.
Strategy
Monopoly involves a substantial portion of luck, with the roll of the dice determining whether a player gets to own key properties or lands on squares with high rents. Even the initial misfortune of going last is a significant disadvantage because one is more likely to land on property which has already been bought and therefore be forced to pay rent instead of having an opportunity to buy unowned property. There are, however, many strategic decisions which allow skilled players to win more often than the unskilled.
Property square probabilities
The layout of the &quot;special&quot; squares on the board (that is, the non-property squares), as well as the dice-roll probabilities, mean that not all squares have an equal probability of being landed upon.

As illustrated by the table, seven is the most probable roll, occurring 6 out of 36 times whereas 2 and 12 are the least probable rolls, each occurring once every 36 rolls. For this reason, Park Place is one of the least landed-on squares as the square seven places behind it is &quot;Go to Jail&quot;.
Also when you are in jail, you are likely to get out by rolling a double, one in every six rolls. A get out of jail free card can be sold to any other player.
In consequence, some properties are landed upon more than others and the owners of those properties get more income from rent. The board layout factors include the following:
Jail: Since players are frequently directed to &quot;Go To Jail,&quot; they will move through the purple, orange and red property groups immediately after leaving Jail. The two properties with the highest probability of being landed upon after leaving jail are the two cheaper orange properties (St James Place and Tennessee Avenue in North America, Bow Street and Marlborough Street outside North America). This makes the orange property set highly lucrative.
Go to&lt;U+2026&gt;: One square &lt;U+2014&gt; Go To Jail &lt;U+2014&gt; plus a number of Chance and Community Chest cards will cause the player to advance a distance around the board. Thus, the squares immediately following Go To Jail and the take-a-card squares have a reduced probability of being landed upon. The least-landed upon property in this situation is the cheaper dark blue property (Park Place or Park Lane) because it sets in the lee of both Go to Jail and one of each take-a-card.
Go to (property): Several properties are blessed with Chance cards which draw players to them. St Charles Place (Pall Mall), Illinois Avenue (Trafalgar Square), Boardwalk (Mayfair), all of the railroads except Short Line (Liverpool Street Station), and both of the utilities benefit from this feature.
Advance to Go: A player may be directed to the Go square by a Chance or a Community Chest card, thus lowering the probability of being landed-upon of every square in-between. The properties most affected by this are the yellow, green, and dark blue sets. It also marginally raises the probability for each square in the wake of Go, including the purple and orange sets which will be reached two or three rolls after being on Go.
Go Back Three Spaces: This directive comes from a Chance card. A quick look at the board shows that there are three Chance squares and hence three other squares which are 3 spaces behind. The leading orange property (New York Avenue or Vine Street) gains the most benefit from this card since the Chance square nestled amongst the red properties is itself the most landed-upon Chance square.
In all, during game play, Illinois Avenue (Trafalgar Square), New York Avenue (Vine Street), B&amp;O Railroad (Fenchurch Street Station), and Reading Railroad (King's Cross Station) are the most frequently landed-upon properties. Mediterranean Avenue (Old Kent Road) and Baltic Avenue (Whitechapel Road) are the least-landed-upon properties. 15
Dealing and bargaining
Much of the skill comes from knowing how to make the best use of a player's resources and above all knowing how to strike a good bargain. Monopoly is a social game where players often interact and must &quot;deal&quot; with each other in ways not unlike &quot;real world&quot; real estate bargaining. Note that the best deal is not always for the most expensive property; it is often situational, dependent on money resources available to each player and even where players happen to be situated on the board. When looking to deal, a player should attempt to bargain with players who not only possess properties he or she needs but also needs property the player has. In fact, offering relatively fair deals to other players can end up helping the player making the offer by giving him or her a reputation as an honest broker, which can make players less wary of dealings in the future. What is more, most people play Monopoly with the same group repeatedly. For this reason, such a reputation can have effects far beyond the game being played.
The end game
One common criticism of Monopoly is that it has carefully defined yet almost unreachable termination conditions. Edward P. Parker, a former president of Parker Brothers, is quoted as saying, &quot;We always felt that forty-five minutes was about the right length for a game, but Monopoly could go on for hours. Also, a game was supposed to have a definite end somewhere. In Monopoly you kept going around and around.&quot;16 However, the problem of time can be resolved by playing with a time limit and counting each player's net worth when the time is up. In fact, tournament play calls for a 90-minute time limit.17 Two hour time limits are used for international play. 18
Played strictly to the rules, many games will be effectively decided when one player succeeds in bankrupting another because the bankrupt player gives all his property to the one to whom he could not pay his debt. A player who thus gains a fistful of properties will virtually control the game from that point onwards since other players will be constantly at risk. On the other hand, if a player is bankrupted by being unable to meet his debt to the bank (e.g., a fine or tax or other debt that is not rent), then his property is auctioned off; this can open up new possibilities in a game which was evenly set or in which a lot of property sets were divided among the players.
Another path to a faster ending is by a key property bargain, whether it be a very shrewd trade which sets one player up with a well-positioned set or a very rash trade where an inexperienced player gives his experienced opponent an underpriced gem. Either way, a deal which pays off for one player is most often the turning point of the game.
A third way to finish the game, though not the fastest, is to jot down important information (like property, money, and spaces the pieces are on), then put that in the box with the game to finish at a later date.
Hasbro states that the longest game of Monopoly ever played lasted 1,680 hours (70 days). 19
Add-ons
Numerous official and unofficial add-ons have been made for Monopoly, both before its commercialization and after. The best-known expansion to the game is the Stock Exchange Add-On, published by Parker Brothers in 1936. The Stock Exchange add-on was later redesigned and rereleased in 1992 under license by Chessex, this time including a large number of new Chance and Community Chest cards. 20
In the Stock Exchange add-on, the Free Parking square is replaced with the Stock Exchange. The add-on also contained three each of Chance and Community Chest cards directing the player to advance to the Stock Exchange. The 1992 add-on also included seven other Chance cards and eight Community Chest cards (to play with the 1992 add-on, one Community Chest card - &quot;From sale of stock you get $45&quot; - is removed).
The add-on also included thirty stock certificates, five for each of the six different stocks, differing only in its purchase price, ranging from $100 to $150. Shares, like properties, can be considered to be tradeable material, and could also be mortgaged for half their purchase price. Shareholders could increase the value of their shares by buying up more of the same company's shares.
When a player moves onto Free Parking, stock dividends are paid out to all players with any unmortgaged shares. The amount to be paid out to each player is determined based on the number and kind of shares owned. Specifically, a player receives dividends from each stock based on the following mathematical formula:
(purchase price of share / 10) &lt;U+00D7&gt; (number of shares owned)2
The player who lands on Free Parking can also choose to buy a share if any remain&lt;U+2014&gt;should the player decline, the Bank auctions a share off to the highest bidder. The 1936 rules are ambiguous with regards to the stock that is put up for auction, and convention has it that the winner of the auction chooses the stock to be received.
The Stock Exchange add-on serves to inject more money into the game, in a similar manner to railroad properties, as well as changing the relative values of properties. In particular, the Yellow and Green properties are more valuable due to the increased chance of landing on Free Parking, at the expense of the Light Purple and Orange groups.
A Monopoly Stock Exchange Edition was released in 2001, this time adding an electronic calculator-like device to keep track of the complex stock figures. This was a full edition, not just an add-on, that came with its own board, money and playing pieces. Properties on the board were replaced by companies on which shares could be floated, and offices and home offices (instead of houses and hotels) could be built. 21
&quot;Playmaster&quot;, another add-on, kept track of all player movement and dice rolls as well as what properties are still available. It then uses this information to call random auctions and mortgages that will be advantageous for some players and a punishment for others, making it easier to free up cards of a color group. It also plays eight short tunes when key game functions occur, for example when a player lands on a railroad it will play I've Been Working on the Railroad. 22
Spinoffs
Monopoly Tycoon is a PC game in the Tycoon series that makes strategy and speed into determining factors for winning the game, eliminating completely the element of luck inherent in the dice rolls of the original. The game uses the U.S. standard Atlantic City properties as its basis, but the game play is unique to this version. The game also allows for solo and multiplayer online games.
Parker Brothers has also sold several games which are spinoffs of Monopoly. These are not add-ons as they don't function as an addition to the Monopoly game, but are simply additional games in the flavor of Monopoly.

A short-lived Monopoly game show aired on Sunday evenings during the summer of 1990 on ABC. The show was produced by Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! creator Merv Griffin. The show was hosted by a former Jeopardy! contestant Mike Riley. Three contestants competed by answering crossword puzzle like clues to acquire the properties on the board. After the properties were acquired, a Monopoly game round was played. The winner then went on to play the bonus game. In the bonus game, the contestant had to choose 4 properties on the board to convert to &quot;Go To Jail&quot; spaces. Along with the actual &quot;Go To Jail&quot; space, the contestant rolled the dice and had to pass GO without landing on a &quot;Go To Jail&quot; space. If the contestant passed Go, they won US$25,000; however if the contestant landed on Go, they would win US$50,000. The show was paired on ABC with a summer long Super Jeopardy! tournament.
In North America, a variety of slot machines have been produced with a Monopoly theme. In Europe, there were also Monopoly &quot;fruit machines&quot;, some of which remain popular through emulation. The British quiz machine brand itbox also supports a Monopoly trivia and chance game, which, like most other itbox games, costs 50p (GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;0.50) to play and has a GB&lt;U+00A3&gt;20 jackpot, although this is very rarely won.
There is also a live, online version of monopoly. Six painted taxis, drive around London picking up passengers. When the taxis reach their final destination, the region of London that they are in is displayed on the online board. This version takes far longer to play than board-game monopoly, with one game lasting 24 hours. Results and position are sent to players via e-mail at the conclusion of the game.23
Variants
Because Monopoly evolved in the public domain before its commercialization, Monopoly has seen many variant games. Most of these are exact copies of the Monopoly games with the street names replaced with locales from a particular town, university, or fictional place. National boards have been released as well. Many of these are listed at Localized versions of the Monopoly game. Details, including box cover art, can be seen in the List of licensed Monopoly game boards. Over the years, many speciality Monopoly editions, licensed by Parker Brothers/Hasbro, and produced by them, or their licensees (including USAopoly and Winning Moves Games) have been sold to local and national markets worldwide. Two well known &quot;families&quot; of -opoly like games, without licenses from Parker Brothers/Hasbro, have also been produced.
Late for the Sky
Late for the Sky Production Company produces a huge range of Monopoly based games with similar rules and board layout as Monopoly but with a large selection of special themes. They also offer Monopoly based games based on your own theme. Major product lines of theirs include nearly sixty titles based on US college and university campuses and the City in a Box line. 24 Late for the Sky has also licensed many of their -Opoly products to Outset Media in Canada for sales there. Outset Media has also produced further games exclusively for the Canadian market that build upon the Late for the Sky product lines.
Help On Board
Help On Board is a company that specializes in creating fundraising board games for various charities. Many of these have been made in an &quot;-opoly&quot; style using locales within a variety of communities in the United States and Canada. Proceeds from sales of the games go to various local causes. A gallery of images of some of these fundraising board games can be seen on their website. 25

The game and its sequel, however, are available directly from the designer's website.

Popular culture
Since Parker Brothers first published and marketed the board game Monopoly in 1935, it has influenced popular culture in many ways. It has been referenced in cartoons, comic strips, novels, and comedy routines, among others.
