Fatiha Boudiaf (Oran, 1944) was married to former Algerian president Muhammad Boudiaf. After his assassination, she set up the Boudiaf Foundation to spread her husband's message of peace and to help Algerian widows.
She received the Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation in 1988.
Ms Boudiaf has denounced the official investigation of her husband's death, suggesting that it was not the work of a lone fanatic but part of a greater plot.
