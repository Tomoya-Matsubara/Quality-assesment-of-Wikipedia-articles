Life
Augustus was born in 1564 as the fifth of fifteen children and the son of William the Younger and his wife Dorothea of Denmark. As a young man he was a colonel in the service of Rudolf II and fought in the campaigns against France and Turkey. In 1610 Augustus became the evangelical Bishop of Ratzeburg. As a priest he was not allowed to marry, but lived with Ilse Schmidtchen in a 'marriage-like relationship.'1 and had 12 children by her. These were later elevated to the hereditary peerage under the name von L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg. In 1633 Augustus followed his brother, Christian, who had died, as Prince of L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg. During the Thirty Years War he continued the policy of neutrality started by his brother. He died in Celle in 1636.
