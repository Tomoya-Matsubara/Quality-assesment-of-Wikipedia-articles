The Ruskin School of Drawing &amp; Fine Art, known as the Ruskin, is an art school at the University of Oxford in Oxford, England.1 Operating across two sites, the School provides undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in the production and study of visual art and the subject is taught as a living element of contemporary culture with a broad range of historical and theoretical references.2 The Head of School is Dr Jason Gaiger.
Ruskin
The School can trace its origins to 1871 when John Ruskin founded a drawing school in the University Galleries (subsequently the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology) to encourage artisanship and technical skills. The Ruskin remained at the Ashmolean until 1974 when it moved to 74 High Street. It also occupies a further building at 128 Bullingdon Road.
The School was originally called the Ruskin School of Drawing. Fine Art was added as a discrete focus in 1945.
The Slade School of Fine Art relocated to the Ruskin for the duration of the Second World War.
