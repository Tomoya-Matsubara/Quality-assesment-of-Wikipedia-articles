So Paulo, named after So Paulo the city, was an early dreadnought built for the Brazilian Navy. Authorized in 1905 as the second of two ships in the Sclass Minas Geraes battleship 4, she was launched on 19 April 1909 and commissioned on 12 July 1910. Soon after, she was involved in the Revolt of the Whip, in which crews on Brazilian warships mutinied over bad pay and harsh punishments for even minor offenses. 
When Brazil entered the First World War, the British declined its offer to send So Paulo and her Sister ship sister Ship Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes  2 to Britain to serve in the Grand Fleet because both ships were in poor condition and neither had been modernized with any of the improvements in fire control technology that had been developed since the vessels' commissioning. To address this, Brazil sent So Paulo to the United States for a full refit, which was not completed until 7 January 1920, well after the war had ended. On 6 July 1922, So Paulo fired her guns in anger for the first time when she fired on a fort that had been taken during the Tenente revolts. Two years later saw the dreadnought embroiled in a second mutiny; the mutineers sailed the ship to Montevideo where they obtained Right of asylum asylum.
In the 1930s, So Paulo was passed over for modernization due to the bad condition the ship was in&mdash;she could only reach a top speed of convert 10 kn mph km/h. For the rest of her career, the ship was reduced to a reserve coast defense role. When Brazil entered the Second World War, So Paulo traveled to the port of Recife and remained there as the port's main defense for the duration of the war. Stricken in 1947, the dreadnought remained as a training vessel until 1951, when she was taken under tow to be scrapped in the United Kingdom. The tow lines broke during a strong gale on 6 November when the ships were convert 150 nmi mi km abbr=on north of the Azores, and the So Paulo was not seen again.
 Background 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Brazil had fallen to the third largest South American naval power, behind Chile and Argentina. After the revolution of 1889, in which Deodoro da Fonseca deposed Pedro II of Brazil, the navy fell into disrepair. By 1900 the only relatively new ships larger than convert 3000 t ST abbr=on lk=on displacement ship displacement were two Coastal defence ship coastal defense battleships of the Sclass Deodoro battleship 4 and two cruisers.Two other coastal defense ships, Riachuelo and Aquidab, had been rebuilt in 18931895 and 18971898, respectively.
At the turn of the twentieth century, however, soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought prosperity to the Brazilian economy.Sondhaus 2001, p. 216Gardiner and Gray 1984, p. 403 The government of Brazil used some of the extra money from this economic growth to finance a large name building program in 1904;Gardiner and Gray 1984, p. 404 this authorized the construction of 28 ships, including three battleships and three armored cruisers. The program was approved by the Brazilian Congress in 1905. The battleships' design was derived from that of the Norwegian Coastal defence ship HNoMS Norge Norge and the British formerly Chilean HMS Triumph 1903 2. They were intended to be ships of convert 12000 t ST abbr=on with twelve convert 10 in cm abbr=on guns in five twin turrets, driven at up to 19&nbsp;Knot speed knots by Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines triple-expansion engines, with convert 9 in cm abbr=on of belt armor and convert 1.5 in cm abbr=on deck armour.Whitley 1999, pp. 2324
The government ordered the three ships from Armstrong Whitworth, who subcontracted parts of the work out to Vickers. However, the advent of dreadnoughts forced Brazil to halt construction almost immediately after the battleships were laid down,Whitley 1999, p. 24 as they would have been obsolete if completed as originally planned. Instead, all construction that had been done was torn down, and the naval architects prepared an entirely new design. This required a new contract, which the Brazilians signed on 20 February 1907. The new design called for a modern dreadnought that would have a maximum speed of convert 21 kn mph km/h and carry twelve EOC 12 inch /45 naval gun convert 12 in cm abbr=on/45 caliber guns for its main armament. Even though this meant that only two ships could be completed immediately, plans went ahead. So Paulo, the largest and most powerful battleship in the world, along with her sister, was ordered on 4 March 1907.Cite news  date = 5 March 1907  title = A Dreadnought for Brazil  work = The New York Times  page = 5  url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9906E1DE1E30E233A25756C0A9659C946697D6CF  format = PDF Vickers Barrow-in-Furness Barrow laid them down on 30 April 1907.
The news shocked Brazil's neighbors, especially Argentina, as the new dreadnoughts outclassed the entire Argentinian fleet.Gardiner and Gray 1984, p. 400 In addition, Brazil's order meant that they had laid down a dreadnought before many of the other major maritime powers, such as Germany, France or Russia;Although Germany laid down SMS Nassau  2 two months after Minas Geraes, Nassau was commissioned first. See: Gardiner and Gray 1984, p. 145 and 403 Minas Geraes and So Paulo made Brazil the third country to have dreadnoughts under construction, behind the United Kingdom and the United States.Whitley 1999, p. 13 In particular, the United States now actively attempted to court Brazil as an ally; caught up in the spirit, U.S. naval journals began using terms like Pan Americanism and Hemispheric Cooperation. Across the sea, British and German professional magazines each speculated that Brazil was just covering for a larger naval power and was planning to hand over the ships to a 'real' owner when they were complete.Miller 2001, p. 84
 Service 
 Early career 
So Paulo was Ship naming and launching launched on 19 April 1909 with many South American diplomats and naval officers in attendance. She was christened by the wife of Brazil's minister to Great Britain, Senhora Regis de Oliveira.Cite news  date = 20 April 1909  title = Launch Brazil's Battleship  work = The New York Times  page = 5  url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9F00E7DA1539E733A25753C2A9629C946897D6CF  format = PDF After she was completed, she left Greenock on 16 September 1910.Whitley 1999, p. 28 Shortly thereafter, she stopped in Cherbourg, France Cherbourg, France to embark the President of Brazil Brazilian President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca. While there, The New York Times reported that officers aboard So Paulo attempted to visit the Maritime Prefect but were rebuffed; the paper speculated that this could cause an International incident diplomatic incident.Cite news  date = 25 September 1910  title = French Criticise Brazil  work = The New York Times  page = C4  url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F00E2DD1F39E333A25756C2A96F9C946196D6CF  format = PDF Departing the city on 28 September, she voyaged to Lisbon, Portugal, where Fonseca was a guest of Portugual's King Manuel II of Portugal Manuel II.Cite news  date = 8 October 1910  title = Keeping Good Order in New Republic  work = The New York Times  page = 12  url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D03E1DB1F39E333A2575BC0A9669D946196D6CF  format = PDF However, soon after they arrived, the 5 October 1910 revolution began. Although the President offered Right of asylum political asylum to the King and his family, the offer was refused, which may have been a fortunate choice: leftists hunting for the missing king boarded and searched the dreadnought while she was in Lisbon.Schenia 2003, p. 73 So Paulo left on 7 October bound for Rio de Janeiro, where she arrived on 25 October.
Just a little more than a month later, she was involved in the Revolt of the Whip. A combination of factors spawned the mutiny, including an economic depression, low pay and the frequent mistreatment of and discrimination against black crew members by white officers. Beginning on Minas Geraes, the mutiny quickly spread to other ships, including So Paulo, the old coastal defence ship Deodoro, and the new cruiser Bahia.Smallman 2002, p. 28Scheina 2003, p. 74Andrews 2004, p. 148
Led by an experienced member of Minas Geraes's crew, Joo Cndido Felisberto the Black Admiral, the rebels stayed disciplined, aided by Felisberto's order that to throw all liquor overboard and his requirement of daily drills.Scheina 2003, p. 74 Afraid that the most powerful warships in the Brazilian Navy would bombard the capital, and with the army unable to help as they were confined to the shores, the National Congress of Brazil gave in to the rebels' demands. These demands included the abolition of flogging, the improvement of living conditions, and the granting of amnesty. However, Congress passed a decree on 28 November that many considered as reversing the amnestythe decree allowed the Minister of the Navy to fire any sailor undermining discipline.Smallman 2002, pp. 2829
So Paulo carried the foreign minister of Brazil to the United States in May 1913. A year later, the World War I First World War began. Brazil declared on 4 August 1914 that they would be neutral, but the sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German U-boats led them first to revoke their neutrality and then to declare war on 26 October 1917.Scheina 2003, pp. 3536 By this time, So Paulo was no longer one of the world's most powerful battleships. She had not been fitted with any of the advances in fire-control that had appeared since her construction, and she was in poor condition.Schenia 2003, p. 37 For these reasons the Royal Navy rejected a Brazilian offer to send her and Minas Geraes to the Grand Fleet. In an attempt to bring battleship up to international standards, Brazil sent So Paulo to the United States in June 1918 to receive a full refit. However, soon after she departed the naval base in Rio de Janeiro, fourteen of the eighteen boilers powering the dreadnought broke down. The USS Nebraska BB-14 6, which was in the area after transporting the deceased Uruguyan Minister to the United States to Montevideo,cite DANFS   title = Nebraska   url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/n3/nebraska.htm   accessdate=17 April 2009 dateformat=dmy rendered assistance in the form of temporary repairs after the ships put in at Salvador, Bahia Bahia. Escorted by Nebraska and the protected cruiser USS Raleigh C-8 6, So Paulo made it to the New York Naval Yard after a 42-day journey.
 1920s 
So Paulo underwent refitting from 7 August 1918 to 7 January 1920. She receuved Sperry Corporation Sperry fire control equipment and Bausch and Lomb range-finders for the two Superfire superfiring Gun turret turrets Bow ship fore and aft. A vertical armor Bulkhead partition bulkhead was fitted inside of all six main turrets, and the secondary battery of convert 4.7 in mm abbr=on casemate guns wasreduced from 22 to four guns. A few modern Anti-aircraft warfare AA guns were fitted as well: two 3/50 caliber guns from Bethlehem Steel were added on the aft superstructure, 37&nbsp;mm guns were added near each turret, and Ordnance QF 3 pounder Vickers 3 pounders were removed from the top of turrets. During this refit, the second-in-command of the ship, Lieutenant Freire, married Ms. M. Rosich of Puerto Rico after a two-week courtship.Cite news  date = 8 October 1919  title = Wed Brazilian Officer  work = The New York Times  page = 19  url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E03E3DD1038EE32A2575BC0A9669D946896D6CF  format = PDF
So Paulo returned home in early 1920 after gunnery practice at Guantanamo Bay. August 1920 saw the dreadnought voyaging across the Equator to Belgium, where she embarked King Albert I of Belgium Albert I and Queen Elisabeth of Bavaria 18761965 Elisabeth on 1 September to transport them to the centennial celebrations in Brazil.cite web url=http://www.naval.com.br/historia/dreadnought/dreadnought-port1.htm title=Os Dreadnoughts Da Marinha Do Brasil: Minas Geraes e So Paulo accessdate=16 April 2009 author=Paulo de Oliveira Ribeiro date=1997 publisher=Brazilian Navy language=PortugueseCite news  date = 1 September 1920  title = King Albert and His Queen Sail for Brazil Today  work = The New York Times  page = 1  url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C04E1DB103FE432A25752C0A96F9C946195D6CF  format = PDF

In 1922, So Paulo and her sister ship helped to put down the first of the Tenente revolts. Soldiers seized Fort Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro on 5 July, but no other men joined them. As a result, some men deserted the rebels, and by the next morning only 200 people remained in the fort.Schenia 2003, p. 128 So Paulo bombarded the fort, firing five salvos and obtaining at least two hits; the fort surrendered half an hour later.cite web url=http://www.naval.com.br/historia/SP_x_Copacabana/SP_x_Copacabana_p2.htm title=Um encouraado contra o forte: 2 Parte author=Guilherme Poggio date=n.d. publisher=Poder Naval Online language=Portuguese
Crewmen aboard So Paulo rebelled again on 4 November 1924, when First Lieutenant Hercolino Cascardo, seven second lieutenants and others commandeered the ship.Scheina 2003, p. 129 After the boilers were fired, So Paulo steamed menacingly around her sister in an attempt to entice her and other ships to join the rebellion. However, So Paulo was only able to sway one old torpedo boat to her cause. Her crew, angry that Minas Geraes would not join them, shot a six-pounder at Minas Geraes which wounded the ship's cook. The mutineers then sailed out of the harbor, exchanging shots with forts at the entrance along the way, and set course for Montevideo in Uruguay., where they arrived on 10 November. The rebellious members of the crew disembarked and were granted Right of asylum asylum, and Minas Geraes, which had been pursuing So Paulo, escorted the wayward ship home to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on the 21st.
 Late career 
By the 1930s, So Paulo and Minas Geraes were showing their age, so a decision to modernize both ships was made. However, the terrible state that So Paulo was inSandler 2004, p. 98she could go at a maximum of only 10&nbsp;knots,Whitley 1999, p. 29 less than half of her design speed of 21&nbsp;knotsmade this uneconomical. As a result, while Minas Geraes was totally refitted from 193135 in the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard,Whitley 1999, p. 27Gardiner and Chesneau 1980, p. 416 So Paulo became a reserve coast defense ship, a role in which she remained for the rest of her service life.
As in the First World War, Brazil stayed neutral during the opening years of the World War II Second World War until U-boat attacks drove the country to declare war on Germany and Italy on 21 August 1942.Schenia 2003, p. 163164 The age and condition of So Paulo relegated her to the role of floating battery; she set sail for Recife on 23 November 1942 with the escort of two American destroyers USS Badger DD-126 2 and USS Davis DD-395 2 and defended the port for the war.

Stricken on 2 August 1947, the ship remained as a training vessel until August 1951, when she was sold to the British Iron and Steel Corporation. So Paulo was taken under tow by two tugs, Dexterous and Bustler, in Rio de Janeiro on 20 September 1951 for one last voyage to the breakers. Somewhere around convert 150 nmi mi km north of the Azores on 6 November, the two lines snapped during a gale, and So Paulo, with the eight men who had been stationed on her still on board, sank shortly thereafter.
