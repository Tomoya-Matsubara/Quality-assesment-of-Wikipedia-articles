A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant is a satirical musical about Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard, written by Kyle Jarrow from a concept by Alex Timbers, the show's original director. The musical runs for an hour in duration, and consists of one act.12 Jarrow based the story of the musical on L. Ron Hubbard's writings and Church of Scientology literature. Early on in the production of the musical, the president of the Church of Scientology in New York sent a letter to the producer pointing out the Church's history of litigation. This led Timbers and Jarrow's attorneys to advise them to insert the word &quot;Unauthorized&quot; into the title of the play.
The musical follows the life of L. Ron Hubbard as he develops Dianetics and then Scientology. Though the musical pokes fun at Hubbard's science fiction writing and personal beliefs, it has been called a &quot;deadpan presentation&quot; of his life story.3 Topics explored in the piece include Dianetics, the E-meter, Thetans, and the story of Xenu. The show was originally presented by Les Freres Corbusier, an experimental theatrical troupe and debuted in November 2003 in New York City, where it had sold-out Off-Off-Broadway and Off-Broadway productions. Later performances have included Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Atlanta and Philadelphia. During the Los Angeles production, representatives of the Church of Scientology visited the production staff in the midst of rehearsals, and handed out documentation of prior successful litigation against critics of Scientology. Parents of some of the Los Angeles cast members also received phone calls from Scientologists in the entertainment industry, asking them not to allow their children perform in the musical.
The productions of A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant in 2003, 2004 and 2006 were well received. The musical received an Obie Award for the 2003 New York production, and director Alex Timbers received a Garland Award for the 2004 Los Angeles production. The play also received positive reviews in the press. The New York Times characterized it as a &quot;cult-hit,&quot; and The Village Voice put the play on a par with The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui. The Los Angeles Times and The Guardian gave the 2004 production favorable reviews, and Variety and The Boston Globe had kind words for the updated 2006 edition. A 2004 cast recording was released by Sh-K-Boom Records, and the CD release received four out of five stars from All Music Guide and positive mention in The Los Angeles Daily News.
Background
Alex Timbers initially developed the concept and directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music and lyrics.4 Jarrow's script was &quot;almost entirely based on Hubbard's own writings and the church's literature,&quot;5 though Jarrow was also influenced by critical journalistic accounts.6 Timbers explained to Variety why they chose to stick to Church of Scientology primary source material for background on the script, stating: &quot;We thought that the best way to satirize the Church of Scientology was to let the Church speak for itself.&quot;7 Jarrow was initially motivated to write the script by what he saw as a shift in religious teachings - from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace.8 Jarrow commented on Timbers' initial idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: &quot;I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of turn you into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants to be taken care of and given answers. And so it all began to make sense to me.&quot;9 During production, the producers were cognizant of the potential for ignorance about some of the content being depicted in the play, and the creative team worked with cast members to educate them about the background behind what they were performing. On preparing cast members for the play, Jarrow stated: &quot;Kids shouldn't just be saying things that they don't understand. That's what we're criticizing...people who just parrot behavior and language. We wanted to have an honest conversation with them.&quot;10
The producers deliberately wanted the musical to appear like a &quot;corny and low-rent production.&quot;11 The ensemble includes ten actors from ages eight to twelve.1213 Though professionals, the child actors perform with a &quot;realistic lack of polish&quot;, as they are actually playing non-professional children of Scientologists, performing in a holiday pageant.14 The chorus portrays Thetans, and the reactive and analytical portions of the mind are depicted by two children who share a conjoined right brain costume.1516 During the Xenu story the narrator is outfitted in a cardboard robot suit, and the actor portraying Xenu wears a &quot;tacky headdress.&quot;17 Staging, costumes and set design are all made to appear to be the &quot;earnest work of schoolteachers and supportive parents trying to provide a colorful and cheery atmosphere on a small budget.&quot;18 The stage design includes a &quot;colorful, crayon-colored backdrop of space age-like, semi-circular set pieces.&quot;19 Costumes include white robes and rainbow-striped socks.20 Props used to denote locations include &quot;a waving cardboard palm frond for Hawaii, a street sign and cell phones for New York.&quot;21 The play ends with a tableau vivant, where the audience sees the cast standing at the back of the theater holding candles and singing cheerfully as a door closes and they are blocked from view.22
Early in the production of the play, John Carmichael, president of the Church of Scientology in New York, found out that a theatrical production involving Scientology was in the works.23 After showing up unannounced to a rehearsal, Carmichael sent a letter to the play's New York producer, Aaron Lemon-Strauss, citing his concerns at the possibility of being ridiculed.2425 In the letter, Carmichael also pointed out the church's many past lawsuits.26 Alex Timbers was quoted as saying: &quot;We've been told that the letter is a precursor to a lawsuit.&quot;27 Carmichael visited the artistic staff a total of three times to voice his concerns before the play's debut.28 After this occurrence, Jarrow and Timbers' attorneys advised them to insert the word &quot;Unauthorized&quot; into the title of the play.2930 This move was done in order to avoid potential litigation from the Church of Scientology.3132 In an interview with The New York Times, Carmichael later stated: &quot;These folks have a right to write whatever play they want.. but they've sunk to cliches.&quot;33
Plot summary
The characters gather on a cold winter night to rejoice in telling the story of L. Ron Hubbard &quot;Hey! It's a Happy Day!&quot;34 A narrator notes: &quot;Today we relate the life of L. Ron Hubbard: Teacher, author, explorer, atomic physicist, nautical engineer, choreographer, horticulturist, and father of Scientology!&quot;35 Hubbard is born in a nativity scene, surrounded by parents and barnyard animals, as an angel proclaims, &quot;Billions of years of evolution had climaxed with his birth.&quot;3637 He begins to question the nature of his existence. He is adrift on a boat in the Pacific ocean during his service in World War II, when he begins to think about starting a religion.38 Hubbard tells his followers about what he has learned through his travels in &quot;Science of the Mind,&quot; singing about &quot;the key to being free, the way to be happy.&quot;39 He tells his followers that during the War &quot;I saw how emotion can make you blind,&quot; and he begins to teach his followers about the reactive mind.40
Hubbard thanks the analytical mind (portrayed by two characters) for helping him to find the answers he was searching for, and proclaims: &quot;Thinking rationally is the way to be happy and the key to learning more.&quot;41 He announces to his followers, &quot;You'll operate with your analytical mind only.... There won't be any emotions to stand in the way of your success.&quot;42 As Hubbard tells his followers about his new ideas, they each proclaim to him: &quot;You&lt;U+2019&gt;re right!&quot; Hubbard answers: &quot;Of course I&lt;U+2019&gt;m right!&quot;43 Hubbard's followers thank him for teaching them his new ideas: &quot;Now the sun will shine / And the world is fine / We have got the science of the mind.&quot;44 A Church of Scientology Auditor explains some technical Scientology jargon to new recruits, and the E-meter is described in a puppet show.4546
As Hubbard's followers progress in their Scientology teachings, they learn of the story of evil alien prince Xenu.47 Celebrity actor characters describe their relationships with Scientology: John Travolta explains how Scientology &quot;fueled his cool&quot;; Kirstie Alley says that it helped her conquer drug addiction &quot;enabling me to star in the fine television series 'Fat Actress' and to promote the quality products of weight loss expert Jenny Craig&quot;; and Tom Cruise interacts with sock-puppet incarnations of his new wife and daughter.48 The Internal Revenue Service brings a case against Hubbard, but he is able to defeat the tax charges by brainwashing his accuser.4950 Celebrities Cruise, Alley and Travolta testify on Hubbard's behalf during the trial.51 Skeptics question Hubbard about the Church of Scientology's finances and methods of recruiting and retaining members.52 One young boy, left alone on the stage, sings about profound alienation.53 The entire company finally comes together to sing the chilling finale, which includes the refrain: &quot;Just don't ask questions / And everything is clear.&quot;54
Musical analysis
In developing the music for the play, Kyle Jarrow incorporated themes from The Road to Freedom, a 1986 pop album which featured performances from John Travolta, Leif Garrett, Frank Stallone, Chick Correa, and Karen Black, because the lyrics to the album were written by L. Ron Hubbard.55 Jarrow also incorporated musical themes from 1980s pop, explaining: &quot;..the liturgical music of Scientology is 1980s pop, which seems strangely appropriate because of the science fiction books. So that's what we did [in the show]. It's a pastiche of synth-pop and pageant choir music.&quot;56 The song, &quot;Hey! It's a Happy Day!&quot; contains an excerpted quote from Hubbard's Scientology: A New Slant On Life.57
Songs are set to &quot;cheesy synth-keyboard backing&quot; and feature &quot;sublimely clunky dance breaks.&quot;58 An electronic score emphasizes the musical's &quot;loony conviction,&quot; and sleigh bells are incorporated into the music which give the play a feeling of a &quot;jazzed-up saint's play.&quot;59 The songs also incorporate video game music, and &quot;beats from a child's keyboard synthesizer with the otherworldly sound of the symphonic band Polyphonic Spree.&quot;60
Productions
2003 - 2004
 A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant first debuted in November 2003, and had sold-out Off-Off-Broadway and Off-Broadway runs that winter, both directed by Alex Timbers.61 The play was initially shown at The Tank theatre on 42nd Street where it ran for three weeks, and later moved to The John Houseman Theatre, where it was performed for an additional three weeks.6263 The play opened in Los Angeles at the Powerhouse Theatre, in October 2004, again directed by Timbers. The run was initially scheduled for October 15 through November 21 2004, but was extended through December 21 2004.6465 Timbers said that he was excited to take the production to Los Angeles, commenting: &quot;Since the whole goal of the show is to imagine how the Scientologists might stage a nativity pageant, there&lt;U+2019&gt;s no better place to try than in their Jerusalem.&quot;66
When the production company first arrived in Los Angeles, the cast and crew were &quot;intimidated&quot; by Scientologists.67 Scientology officials visited the theatre in the midst of rehearsals and handed out &quot;documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods.&quot;68 Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as &quot;terrifically wonderful and intimidating.&quot;69 Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play.7071 In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, &quot;it might be bad for their future career.&quot;72 The parents politely informed these callers &quot;We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't share your concerns.&quot;73 When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: &quot;This is not litigation material. This is nothing.&quot;74
2006 - present
In 2006, the play was performed at New York Theatre Workshop's 4th Street Theatre in New York City. The show ran from November 29, to January 7, 2006, with Alex Timbers reprising his role as director and Gabriel Kahane as musical director.757677 That same year, the show was also presented at the Center for the Arts in Boston, and at Dad's Garage Theatre in Atlanta.7879 When contacted by The Boston Globe for a statement on the 2006 Boston production of the play, Boston Church of Scientology president Gerard Renna stated that the musical: &quot;is not something we're addressing,&quot; and that they were instead focused on antidrug education.80 A 2007 edition of the play will be shown in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with performances December 13, through December 30, 2007.81 There will also be a 2007 production again at Dad's Garage Theatre, from November 30 to December 23 2007, directed by Mary Claire Dunn.82
Reception
Awards
A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant received a 2004 Obie Award for its 2003 production in New York City.8384 Kyle Jarrow and Alex Timbers were given &quot;Special Citations&quot; from The Village Voice for developing the piece.85 Timbers and Jarrow were honored with the award at the May 17, 2004 Obie Award presentation, at New York's Webster Hall.8687 Alex Timbers also received a Garland Award for best director, for the 2004 Los Angeles production of the play.8889
Reviews
A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant received positive reviews from the press. A review in the The New York Times described the play as having a &quot;crude, faux-na&lt;U+00EF&gt;f sensibility&quot;, and stated that it &quot;provides a cult-hit blueprint for a young generation that prefers its irony delivered with not a wink but a blank stare.&quot;90 A 2003 review in New York City's The Village Voice compared the play to The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, stating: &quot;Just as Ui doesn't explain the complex phenomenon of the Third Reich, Scientology Pageant doesn't probe the psychology of cults; instead, both demystify subjects whose appeal stems in no small part from the mystique their acolytes have attributed to them.&quot;91 Though most of the media reception of the play was positive, New York Church President John Carmichael did not have kind words for the production. Carmichael asserted that L. Ron Hubbard was portrayed in the play as &quot;an authoritarian demagogue whose methods create emotionless followers.&quot;92 Other critics complained that the young members of the cast were portraying characters and depicting content that they could not understand.93
The Los Angeles Times reviewed the play in 2004, and stated that: &quot;The show found a New York audience willing to move from the tongue-in-cheek children's pageant concept to something that became startlingly adult.&quot;94 In a 2004 review in The Guardian, the article cited notable quotes from other reviews, including The New York Times, The Village Voice, and The New York Observer. The review stated that audiences &quot;have a chance to witness a wide-eyed, straight-faced, scrappy and touching telling of the story of L Ron set to a cheesy electro-pop score. See the great man, clad in a white Plyphonic Spree-style gown, wander from inquisitive soul to wounded war veteran to writer of pulp science fiction to leader of world religion. Sort of.&quot;95
Of the updated 2006 version, Variety stated that &quot;..the breezy one-hour show is equal parts adorable and creepy, hilarious and unsettling, making it way more compelling than your average holiday entertainment.&quot;96 The Boston Globe also reviewed the 2006 edition of the play, and its review spent more time giving background on some of the cast and crew, particularly writer Kyle Jarrow, stating that &quot;..Jarrow has created a musical about L. Ron Hubbard that is, in its own sardonic way, much more funny and touching than any of Cruise's diatribes against Ritalin.&quot;97 The New York Sun described the production as an: &quot;ingenious musical account of L. Ron Hubbard's life and times,&quot; and compared the discomfort produced by watching the piece to the 2006 documentary Jesus Camp.98
Cast recording
A cast recording of the play was released by Kurt Deutsch's Sh-K-Boom Records, on November 2, 2004.99 &quot;Hey! It's a Happy Day!,&quot; &quot;Science of the Mind,&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; and &quot;Finale&quot; are tracks from the original 2004 production.100 The other songs on the album were written by Jarrow &quot;.. to further explore the subjects and themes of the stage production.&quot;101 The first track on the album is entitled &quot;Disclaimer&quot;, and is a general announcement to the audience. The Los Angeles Daily News surmised that this disclaimer served to &quot;keep the creators of this acidic little send-up from getting hauled into court&quot;:102
The CD release received four out of five stars from All Music Guide, where it was described as &quot;Funny, weird and wonderful&quot;, and &quot;the offbeat theater offering of the year.&quot; Specific tracks highlighted by All Music Guide included &quot;L. Ron Hubbard,&quot; in which the chorus centers on the question: &quot;What does the &quot;L.&quot; stand for?,&quot; and &quot;The Way [sic] It Began,&quot; which begins with the preface statement: &quot;The following is completely secret and absolutely serious. It is the story of the universe as described in the most sacred literature of the Church of Scientology.&quot; In the song &quot;Mister Auditor,&quot; the children actually sing some of the typical questions asked in Scientology auditing, and in the song &quot;Something Special,&quot; allegations that the Church of Scientology: &quot;preys on the weak and confused&quot; are discussed, but the narrator states that none of these allegations are true.103
