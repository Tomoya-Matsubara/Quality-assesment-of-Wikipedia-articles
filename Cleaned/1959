The 5 Point Cafe is a bar and 24-hour cafe and bar in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. It is located by Tilikum Place near a five-way intersection. Open since 1929, it is a drinking establishment that is considered the oldest in the neighborhood. The bar has received accolades from local media for being one of the best dive bars in the city.
History
The building was originally constructed by the Webb Investment Company in 1922 for use as a dairy warehouse. It was built in what was known as the Denny Regrade, named after a project to flatten Denny Hill. C. Preston Smith opened the cafe during an economic downturn in 1929. Coffee, two eggs, a ham steak, hashbrowns, and four pieces of buttered toast with jelly cost 40 cents.1 Smaller dishes were 25 cents or less. A barroom was opened adjacent to the cafe upon the repeal of prohibition in 1933 to sell beer and wine. It became a lounge when state law allowed for the sale of hard liquor in 1944.2
Smith's son, Dick, took over in 1975.3 Along with political activities in the neighborhood, the younger Smith was known for installing a periscope over the men's room urinal to provide views of the Space Needle.45
The 5 Point Cafe made headlines in August 2004 when radio personality Tom Leykis was ejected and then assaulted outside. Leykis said his assailant kicked him in the head and knocked him to the ground. He was cut above the eye and needed 17 stitches.67
There were rumors of the establishment's pending closure in September 2009.8 In November 2009, it was purchased by David Meinert. He has changed little but the menu was expanded slightly with vegetarian options.9
Culture
 The 5 Point Cafe serves large portions of traditional American food and stiff drinks at inexpensive prices. Located in what is now an affluent neighborhood, it has historically catered to working class and eclectic patrons. Brassieres dangle from a stuffed moose head and there is a juke box with an expansive collection.101112
The cafe has been called one of the best dive bars in the world by the alternative weekly newspaper The Stranger.13 It has been voted &quot;Best Dive Bar&quot; in Seattle several times by Seattle Magazine.14
The younger Smith installed quirky signs throughout the location. Before Washington banned smoking in restaurants and bars, the cafe touted it as smoker-friendly with a sign that read: &quot;Smokers welcome, non-smokers beware&quot;.15 Other signs have slogans such as &quot;We cheat tourists-n-drunks since 1929&quot;16 and &quot;Alcoholics Serving Alcoholics since 1929&quot;.17
