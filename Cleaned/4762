Richie Ramsay (born 23 June 1983) is a Scottish professional golfer.
In 2006, Ramsay became the first British golfer in almost a century to win the United States Amateur Championship.1 He also won several other amateur titles and played in the 2005 Walker Cup.
Ramsay turned professional in 2007, and played two seasons on the second tier Challenge Tour, winning twice in 2008. He finished 8th on the end of season rankings that year to graduate to the elite European Tour for 2009.
Personal life
Ramsay was born in Aberdeen. He is an honorary member of Royal Aberdeen Golf Club and was a student at the Stirling University in Scotland, where he graduated in 2007.
Amateur career
Ramsay won the Scottish Amateur Open Stroke Play Championship in 2004, and the Irish Amateur Open Stroke Play Championship in 2005. He went on to represent Great Britain &amp; Ireland in the Walker Cup later that year.
In 2006, Ramsay won the U.S. Amateur Championship, defeating American John Kelly 4 &amp; 2 in the 36-hole final. He was the first British player to win the championship since 1911, and the first Scot since 1898.2 He topped the first edition of the World Amateur Golf Ranking, which was issued by the R&amp;A on 23 January 2007.
After playing in the 2007 Masters, U.S. Open and Open Championship, for which he had qualified through his U.S. Amateur victory, Ramsay turned professional. The move meant that he would not be eligible to play in a second Walker Cup later that year.3
Professional career
Ramsay made his professional d&lt;U+00E9&gt;but in August 2007 at the European Tour's Russian Open.4 He finished that event in a tie for 53rd place, and completed the remainder of the season playing tournaments on the second tier Challenge Tour. Having failed to come through final qualifying school at the end of the season, he again played on the Challenge Tour in 2008. He won his first professional tournaments during the 2008 season, the Vodafone Challenge in Germany and the AGF-Allianz Golf Open Grand Toulouse.5 He ended the year in 8th place on the Challenge Tour Rankings to graduate directly to the European Tour for 2009.6
