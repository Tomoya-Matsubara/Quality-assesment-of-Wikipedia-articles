 Anthony (Tony) Steven Christiansen (born 23 October 1958) is a world-leading motivational and inspirational speaker. He authored the best-sellers Race You To The Top,1 Attitude Plus!2 and Don't Just Sit There.
In his presentations, he exudes a strong presence and speaks with clarity and purpose, and eliminates redundant words.3 Christiansen starts by climbing a 1.5-metre high scaffolding, a show that leaves his audience gobsmacked.4
The basis of Christiansen's presentation is self belief;5 the theme is simply &quot;Your attitude determines your altitude in life&quot;.6 Christiansen has no legs, a result of a horrific train accident when he was a child yet has achieved remarkable feats in his life. He shares his life story and the secrets to his success7 and encourages his audience to set their own challenges, rather than accept the limitations imposed by their own attitudes and other people's perception.8
Early Life 9
Christiansen was born in Tauranga, New Zealand. His father Bernard worked in a timber yard and his mother Doreen was a homemaker who immigrated to New Zealand from England after the World War II. He is the youngest of 3 siblings which include brother Frank and sister Susan. 
Hit By A Train
On the morning of 3 June 1967 which was Queen's Birthday weekend, Christiansen had followed friend Gary Winters and his father Mick to the railway yard near Te Maunga to bag coal for sale to raise money for charity. As the 2 children were crossing the tracks, the train shunted backwards dragging Christiansen under and the dual set of wheels ran over his legs almost severing them.10
As a result of this accident, both his legs could not be saved and were amputated. 48 hours after the accident, Christiansen was found sitting up in a wheelchair and in good spirits.11
Extraordinary Achievements
Christiansen very quickly got on with life after his wounds healed. His extraordinary achievements following the accident made him New Zealand's most notable motivational speaker12 and one of the world's most interesting.13
Confidence in the Water
After his accident, many people including strangers, visited Christiansen and wanted to help. Among them, 2 people made a significant difference to Christiansen&lt;U+2019&gt;s life. They were swimming coaches Dave Franklin and Allan Guthrie.14
Even before his accident, Christiansen hated water but Franklin and Guthrie were very persistent in teaching the now disabled young boy how to swim. Within 5 months of his first lesson, less than a year after his accident, Christiansen at 10 years of age, swam a mile non-stop.15
The following year, Christiansen joined the Tauranga Swimming Club and continued to improve as a swimmer while he became physically stronger. He set a goal to compete in the Tauranga mayor&lt;U+2019&gt;s annual sponsored swimming race held by the Lions Club.
On 6 May 1971, Christiansen came just behind the mayor Bob Owen in that 2-mile race 16 and in February 1974, he beat the mayor in the Annual Harbour &lt;U+201C&gt;Swimathon&lt;U+201D&gt;.17

Surf Lifesaving
During his years in school, Christiansen was alienated from most of the physical activities. In his fifth form, week-long school camps were held, none of which he could participate in. As a result, his old swimming coach Dave Franklin invited him to join the surf lifesaving camp at the Omanu surf club. By the end of that week, Christiansen earned his surf lifesaving Bronze Medallion (New Zealand and Australia) 1819 and joined the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club.
In 1978, Christiansen was granted a Special Achievement Award from World Life Saving 2021 which today is known as the International Life Saving Federation. In the same year, he gained his instructor&lt;U+2019&gt;s certificate.22
Christiansen remained a member of the Omanu Pacific Surf Lifesaving Club and worked as a surf lifeguard until the age of 23. He was also the club's canoe team captain.23 Throughout his career as a surf lifesaver, Christiansen made 33 rescues.2425 He was believed to be the only paraplegic lifeguard in the Southern Hemisphere.26

The Successful Business37
In the book about his life, Race You To The Top, Christiansen described his performance in school as &lt;U+201C&gt;having artistic talent but never very academic&lt;U+201D&gt;.
While at school, Christiansen worked part-time doing signwriting jobs on stockcars and the same for Woolworths. These credentials later led to a job as a ticket writer in New World (supermarket). At the same time, he also worked for the Tauranga Museum where he learned many new skills.38
Christiansen tried applying for jobs with signwriting companies but his numerous attempts failed. He eventually hassled Lance Styles, the owner of Commercial Signs, enough to land a job. Within 3 months, he had proven himself and impressed Styles who made him foreman.
Christiansen later left Commercial Signs. In 1985, he returned and took a stake in the company. In 1995, he bought over the rest of the shareholding and became the sole owner of the company. For the next 2 years, he turned it into one of the largest commercial signwriting business in New Zealand and sold it in 1997 39 to begin his career as a professional speaker.

More Recent Achievements
Kilimanjaro74
 In 2002, Christiansen was invited by Korean Broadcasting System to scale Mount Kilimanjaro with 2 other Koreans &lt;U+2013&gt; Soo Young, a blind young woman and Hong Bin, an experienced mountaineer who lost all his fingers to frostbite on a climbing expedition in Canada.75
After about 2 weeks of preparations and media interviews in Korea, the group departed for Dar es Salaam, Nairobi and travelled onwards to Arusha in northern Tanzania. They spent 3 days filming in a village with the Masai people.
Christiansen climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in his mountain-climbing wheelchair as much as he could and the rest of the journey on his backside with only a pair of hi-tech, New Zealand-designed vinyl pants and a pair of gloves protecting him from the sharp volcanic rocks.76
The group reached the summit of the mountain on 21 December 2002. Christiansen reached Gilman&lt;U+2019&gt;s Point, the second highest peak at 5,685 metres. He did not reach Uhuru, the highest peak at 5,895 metres as he admitted in his book that he could not physically go on through the incredibly steep and rough terrain at the summit. It was also snowing and raining and it was getting dark, all making it too dangerous to carry on.
It took Christiansen 10 hours to reach Gilman&lt;U+2019&gt;s Point from Kibo Hut which is the last station on the Marangu Route, and only 2 hours to descent.
Christiansen&lt;U+2019&gt;s Kilimanjaro experience is told in detail in his second book &lt;U+201C&gt;Attitude Plus!&lt;U+201D&gt;.77 He considers his climb to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro one of his proudest moment.78
