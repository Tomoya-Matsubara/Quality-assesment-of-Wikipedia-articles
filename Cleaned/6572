Randal &quot;Randy&quot; Brecker (b. Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, November 27, 1945) is an American trumpeter1 and flugelhornist. His versatility in musical tastes have made him a sought-after player, equally accomplished in playing jazz, rock, and R&amp;B. He has also worked as a studio player for many famous musicians. He has performed or recorded with Stanley Turrentine, Billy Cobham, Bruce Springsteen, Lou Reed, Sandip Burman, Charles Mingus, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Horace Silver, Frank Zappa, Parliament-Funkadelic, Chris Parker, Jaco Pastorius, Dire Straits, Todd Rundgren, Blue &lt;U+00D6&gt;yster Cult, Richard Barone, Spyro Gyra, Barbara Dennerlein and many others. In his formative years, Brecker studied trumpet with Bill Adam at Indiana University.
Early Life
Born in 1945 in Philadelphia to a musical family, he attended Indiana University from 1963 to 1966 studying with Bill Adam, David Baker2 and Jerry Coker and later moved to New York and performed with Clark Terry&lt;U+2019&gt;s Big Bad Band, the Duke Pearson and the The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra.
Career
In 1967, Randy ventured into jazz-rock with the band Blood, Sweat and Tears, recording their first album Child Is Father to the Man, but left to join the Horace Silver Quintet. He recorded his first solo album, ''Score&lt;U+2019&gt;', in 1968, featuring Michael Brecker.
After Horace Silver, Randy joined Art Blakey&lt;U+2019&gt;s Jazz Messengers before teaming up with brother Michael, Barry Rogers, Billy Cobham, and John Abercrombie to form the fusion group Dreams. The group recorded two albums: Dreams and &lt;U+2018&gt;'Imagine My Surprise&lt;U+2019&gt;' for Columbia Records before they disbanded in 1971.
In the early 1970s, Randy performed live with many artists including [[The Eleventh House], Stevie Wonder and Billy Cobham. He also recorded several albums with his brother under pianist/composer Hal Galper.
By 1975, Randy and Michael formed the Brecker Brothers band. They released six albums on Arista and garnered seven Grammy nominations between 1975 and 1981.3 Their first record featured Randy&lt;U+2019&gt;s composition &quot;Some Skunk Funk&quot;.
After the Brecker Brothers disbanded in 1982, Randy recorded and toured as a member of Jaco Pastorius' Word of Mouth big band. It was soon thereafter that he met and later married Brazilian jazz pianist Eliane Elias. Eliane and Randy formed their own band, touring the world several times and recording one album together, Amanda on Passport Records.
In 1992 Randy and Michael reunited for a world tour and the triple-Grammy nominated GRP recording &lt;U+2018&gt;'The Return of the Brecker Brothers&lt;U+2019&gt;'.4 The follow-up, 1994&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+2018&gt;'Out of the Loop'', was a double-Grammy winner.5
In 1997, Into the Sun (Concord), a recording featuring Brecker's impressions of Brazil, garnered Brecker his first Grammy as a solo artist.
In 2001, Randy released &lt;U+2018&gt;'Hangin&lt;U+2019&gt; in the City&lt;U+2019&gt;' (ESC), a solo project that introduced his alter-ego Randroid with lyrics and vocals by Randroid himself. This CD was released in Europe, [where Randy toured extensively with his own line-up.6
Randy&lt;U+2019&gt;s next CD for ESC Records, 34th N Lex, won him his third Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album in 2003. That summer he went back to Europe with the [Bill Evans (saxophonist)|]] Soulbop Band.7
In the summer of 2003 the Brecker Brothers appeared in Japan at the Mount Fuji Jazz Festival.8
2004 saw Randy touring Europe as co-leader (with Bill Evans) of the band Soulbop. The WDR Big Band also invited Randy to perform at the [Jazz Fest]. The date was of significance to Randy as it was the last time he played with his brother, who took ill shortly thereafter with a rare form of leukemia known as MDS.
In 2005, Brecken's wife Ada sat in for the first time.9 Brecker's schedule continued with the Randy Brecker Band performing throughout Eastern Europe.
In 2007, [Randy was awarded his fourth Grammy for Randy Brecker Live with the WDR Big Band (Telarc/BHM), the live recording (also available in DVD format) of his performance with Michael at the Leverkusen Jazz Fest in 2004.10 Michael died that same year on January 13.11
2007 also saw the release of a two-CD set of live recordings of the band Soulbop (BHM) featuring Dave Kikoski, Victor Bailey, Steve Smith, Rodney Holmes and []Hiram Bullock]].12
Brecker returned to Brazilian music in 2008 for the album &lt;U+2018&gt;'Randy in Brazil&lt;U+2019&gt;', which was recorded in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo with Brazilian musicians and released on Summit Records. Chosen one of the top 10 CDs of 2008 by All About Jazz, the CD won the Grammy for &quot;Best Contemporary Jazz Album&quot;, bringing his Grammy total to five.13
A Tribute to the Brecker Brothers featuring Randy and recorded live at the Hamamatsu Jazz Festival in Japan with Yoichi Murata&lt;U+2019&gt;s Solid Brass &amp; Big Band was released by JVC Victor in Japan in late 2008.14
in 2009, Brecker released &lt;U+2018&gt;'Jazz Suite Tykocin&lt;U+2019&gt;', a project initiated and conceived by the Polish pianist and composer W&lt;U+0142&gt;odek Pawlik, featuring Randy as a soloist with members of the Bialystok Philharmonic. Tykocin is the area in Poland where Brkecken's ancestors (mother&lt;U+2019&gt;s maiden name: Tecosky) hail from, a fact that Pawlik discovered.15
2011 saw the release of &lt;U+2018&gt;'The Jazz Ballad Song Book: Randy Brecker with the Danish Radio Big Band and The Danish National Chamber Orchestra&lt;U+2019&gt;', which garnered four Grammy nominations and critical acclaim.16 In 2012, Legacy Recordings released the boxed setThe Brecker Brothers &lt;U+2013&gt; The Complete Arista Albums Collection.
A Brecker Brothers Band Reunion tour of European festivals in the summer of 2013 supported Brecker&lt;U+2019&gt;s Brecker Brothers Band Reunion, a dual-disk project which was released on September 25, 2013 on Piloo Records. It features a live DVD recorded at the Blue Note in New York City with a new 11-song studio recording featuring members of the Brecker Brothers bands from throughout the years including David Sanborn, Mike Stern, Bill Lee, and Dave Weckl. George Whitty produced the album, and Brecker's wife Ada Rovatti also played saxophone. The recording was released in North America by Magenta/E-One, in Europe by Moosicus Records in November and in Japan by Victor. It is dedicated to his brother, Michael, and other departed Brecker Brothers Band members.1718
