An embedded database system is a database management system (DBMS) which is tightly integrated with an application software that requires access to stored data, such that the database system is &quot;hidden&quot; from the application&lt;U+2019&gt;s end-user and requires little or no ongoing maintenance. It is actually a broad technology category that includes database systems with differing application programming interfaces (SQL as well as proprietary, native APIs); database architectures (client-server and in-process); storage modes (on-disk, in-memory and combined); database models (relational, object-oriented, entity&lt;U+2013&gt;attribute&lt;U+2013&gt;value model and network/CODASYL); and target markets.
The term embedded database can be confusing because only a small subset of embedded database products is used in real-time embedded systems such as telecommunications switches and consumer electronics devices.1 (See mobile database for small-footprint databasees that could be used on embedded devices.)

ElevateDB is a royalty-free, SQL:2003-compliant, compact, embedded database engine available for Delphi (Win32), C++Builder (Win32), Lazarus (Win32/WinCE), Visual Studio (.NET and .NET CF), and any ODBC-compliant application. Under Delphi, Lazarus, and C++Builder, ElevateDB can be compiled directly into the application, whereas under .NET it is one assembly and the ODBC driver is implemented as one .DLL. ElevateDB operates in single-user, multi-user file-sharing, and client-server modes, and includes the ElevateDB Server for client-server operation.
Embedded InnoDB
Embedded InnoDB is a standalone, embeddable form of the InnoDB Storage Engine. Given that Embedded InnoDB is based on the same code base as the InnoDB Storage Engine, it contains many of the same features: high-performance and scalability, multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), row-level locking, deadlock detection, fault tolerance, automatic crash recovery, etc. However, because the embedded engine is completely independent from MySQL, it lacks server components such as networking, object-level permissions, etc. By eliminating the MySQL server overhead, InnoDB has a small footprint and is well-suited for embedding in applications which require high-performance and concurrency. As with most embedded database systems, Embedded InnoDB is designed to be accessed primarily with an ISAM-like C API rather than SQL (though an extremely rudimentary SQL variant is supported).
Embedded InnoDB has not seen any product updates since 2009 (and downloads currently seem to be broken), but a non-Oracle maintained fork exists with HailDB.
Empress Embedded Database
Empress Software, Inc., developer of the Empress Embedded Database, is a privately held company founded in 1979. Empress Embedded Database is a full-function, relational database that has been embedded into applications by organizations small to large, with deployment environments including medical systems, network routers, nuclear power plant monitors, satellite management systems, and other embedded system applications that require reliability and power.2 Empress is an ACID compliant, SQL database engine with C, C++, Java, JDBC, ODBC, SQL, ADO.NET and kernel level APIs. Applications developed using these APIs may be run in standalone and/or server modes. Empress Embedded Database runs on Linux, Unix, Microsoft Windows and real-time operating systems.
Extensible Storage Engine
ESE is an Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM) data storage technology from Microsoft. ESE is notably a core of Microsoft Exchange Server and Active Directory. Its purpose is to allow applications to store and retrieve data via indexed and sequential access. Windows Mail and Desktop Search in the Windows Vista operating system also make use of ESE to store indexes and property information respectively.
eXtremeDB
McObject launched eXtremeDB as the first in-memory embedded database designed from scratch for real-time embedded systems. The initial product was soon joined by eXtremeDB High Availability (HA) for fault tolerant applications. The product family now includes 64-bit and transaction logging editions, and the hybrid eXtremeDB Fusion, which combines in-memory and on-disk data storage. In 2008, McObject introduced eXtremeDB Kernel Mode, the first embedded DBMS designed to run in an operating system kernel.3 Today, eXtremeDB is used in millions of real-time and embedded systems worldwide. McObject also offers Perst, an open source, object-oriented embedded database for Java, Java ME, .NET, .NET Compact Framework and Silverlight.
Firebird Embedded
Firebird Embedded is a relational database engine. It's an open source fork of InterBase, is ACID compliant, supports triggers and stored procedures, and is available on Linux and Win32/Win64 systems. It has the same features as the classic and superserver version of Firebird, two or more threads (and applications) can access the same database at the same time starting with Firebird 2.5. So Firebird embedded acts as a local server for one threaded client accessing its databases (that means it works properly for ASP.NET web applications, because there, each user has its own thread, which means two users could access the same database at the same time, but they would not be in the same thread, because ASP.NET opens a new thread for each user). It exports the standard Firebird API entrypoints. The main advantage of Firebird embedded databases is, that unlike SQlite or Access databases, they can be plugged-in to a full Firebird server without any modifications at all also is multiplatform (runs on Linux, OS X with full asp.net mono support)
H2
Written in Java Open source very fast database engine. Embedded and Server mode, Clustering support, can run inside the Google App Engine. Supports encrypted database files (AES or XTEA).

InfinityDB provides a data integrity guarantee through all non-media failures, provides a simple API with only a few basic methods, and requires no administrative support. Version 2 offers full ACID transactionality without a log and with fine-grained locks. Programmers can superimpose their own data model, or employ the entity&lt;U+2013&gt;attribute&lt;U+2013&gt;value model, by direct low-level access. The basic engine provides multi-valued or set attributes, all primitive Java types, unlimited large objects, heterogenous values, composite keys (Entities) and values, and unlimited sparse attributes, all extensible in-place with no schema changes.

LevelDB
LevelDB is an ordered key/value store created by Google as a lightweight implementation of the BigTable storage design. As a library (which is the only way to use LevelDB), its native API is C++. It also includes official C wrappers for most functionality. Third-party API wrappers exist for Python, PHP, Go (pure Go LevelDB implementation exists but is in progress still), and Objective C. Google distributes LevelDB under the New BSD License.
LightningDB
LightningDB is a memory-mapped database developed by Symas for the OpenLDAP Project. It is written in C and the API is modeled after the Berkeley DB API, though much simplified. The library is extremely compact, compiling down to under 40KB of x86 object code, corruption proof, and orders of magnitude faster, more robust, more scalable, and more efficient than similar libraries like Berkeley DB, LevelDB, etc. The library implements B+trees with multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), Single_level_store, Copy_on_write and provides full ACID transactions with no deadlocks. The library is optimized for high read concurrency; readers need no locks at all. Readers don't block writers and writers don't block readers, so read performance scales perfectly linearly across arbitrarily many threads and CPUs. Third-party wrappers exist for C++, Erlang and Python. Lightning DB is distributed by the OpenLDAP Project under the OpenLDAP Public License. As of 2013 the OpenLDAP Project is deprecating the use of Berkeley DB, in favor of LightningDB.
MySQL Embedded Server Library
The libmysqld, MySQL Embedded Server Library provides most of the features of regular MySQL as a linkable library that can be run in the context of a client process. After initialization clients can use the same C API calls as when talking to a separate MySQL server but with less communication overhead and with no need for a separate database process.
NexusDB
NexusDB is the commercial successor to the FlashFiler database which is now open source. They can both be embedded in Delphi applications to create stand-alone executables with full database functionality.

It was originally developed at the University of California.5 Berkeley DB is a fast, open-source embedded database and is used in several well-known open-source products, including the Linux and BSD Unix operating systems, Apache Web server, OpenLDAP directory, OpenOffice productivity suite.6
RDM Embedded
RDM Embedded, produced by Raima was one of the first database management systems to be categorized as an embedded database when it made its debut in 1984 under the name db_Vista. According to Raima's definition, the product is embedded in two senses: first, it is embedded within an application, becoming an extension to the application, second, it is possible to use it in embedded computer/OS or real-time environments because of its small footprint and efficient operation. Its APIs (for C/C++ and SQL) have been designed to support the limited resources of embedded environments. Since its initial release, RDM Embedded has been continually evolving and is currently released as version 10.1. Today Raima produces two products under the product names RDM Embedded and RDM Server.
