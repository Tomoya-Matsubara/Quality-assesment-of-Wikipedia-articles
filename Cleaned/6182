Rancho La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada was a  Mexican land grant in present day Los Angeles County, California given in 1843 by Governor Manuel Micheltorena to a Mexican schoolteacher from Los Angeles, Ygnacio Coronel. The name means &quot;ranch of the canyon&quot;. The rancho included the current day cities of La Canada, La Crescenta and Flintridge.12
History
In 1843, Ygnacio Coronel was granted a property he called La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada Atras de Rancho Los Verdugos (&quot;canyon behind the Verdugo ranch&quot;).3 Julio Verdugo disputed the grant claiming it was part of his Rancho San Rafael. Ygnacio Coronel built a small house near where is now Glendale College, and farmed there until outlaws threatened his family. During the American-Mexican War (1847), Coronel abandoned the rancho, and in 1852 sold Rancho La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada to the law partners Jonathan R. Scott and Benjamin Hayes. Scott had come to Southern California from Missouri in 1849, and became the first American justice of the peace in Los Angeles. He administered the oath of office to the first Los Angeles City Council on July 3, 1850. Scott bought out Hayes portion of Rancho La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada.
A claim for Rancho La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852 and Scott received a US patent in 1866.45
In 1857, Scott traded Rancho La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada to Julio and Catalina Verdugo, heirs of Jose Maria Verdugo, for  on the west side of Rancho San Rafael - what is today Burbank.6 In 1875 Rancho La Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;ada was sold to two healthseekers from Michigan, Jacob Lanterman, a dentist, and Colonel Adolphus Williams, a Civil War veteran.7
