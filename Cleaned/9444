Biography
In 1984, James Marra, Todd Dyer, Rudy Goryance, and Will Palmer formed the metal band AndzVolt. Palmer was later replaced by 2 guitarists, Todd Boese and Charlie Cook. After 2 years of touring they replaced Cook for guitarist Eddie Rice, and Goryance for drummer Hal Loo and changed the band's name to Powersurge.
Later that year, Powersurge released the demo Elements of Metal, bringing the band to the attention of Roadrunner Records. Loo left the band, and Goryance returned to play drums. In 1991, Powersurge released their debut album, MCMXCI. Shortly afterwards, Marra and Boese left, and the band split up. However, between 1986 to 1990 the band had recorded 38 original songs. This material was remixed and came out in 4 releases: two on O.P.M. Records in 2000 and 2003, and two on Battle Cry Records in 2006.
On June 21st 2009, Todd Dyer, the long time bass player and core member of Powersurge, died after being recently diagnosed with throat cancer.
