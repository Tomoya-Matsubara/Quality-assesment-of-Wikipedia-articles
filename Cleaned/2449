Bolton Wanderers end the year bottom of the Premier League; Blackburn Rovers (who were bottom on Christmas) and Wigan Athletic remain in the relegation zone, although the pressure is building up on Wolverhampton Wanderers and QPR.54 In the Championship, Southampton remain top and still well placed for a second successive promotion. Middlesbrough now occupy second, while West Ham United, Cardiff City, Reading and Hull City complete the top six. The relegation zone remains unchanged from end of November.55
31 January 2012: January ends with Manchester City still top of the Premier League, but with United now level on points with them, five points ahead of third-place Tottenham.

29 February 2012: February ends with Manchester City two points clear of Manchester United in second and 10 points clear of Tottenham Hotspur, whose title charge now appears to be over following a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;2 defeat at rival Arsenal, who end the month in the crucial fourth place.

The rest of the top seven remains unchanged, except that Everton have now moved ahead of their Merseyside rivals Liverpool, who are in eighth place with a game in hand. Wolves have only managed to pick up one point following the sacking of Mick McCarthy and look doomed for relegation as they stand six points adrift of safety with seven games left to play. Blackburn Rovers, with a game in hand, are ahead of QPR and Wigan only by virtue of goals scored; Bolton are a point ahead of Blackburn, having played the same number of games as their Lancashire rivals.71 In the Championship, Southampton look certain for promotion as they are six points clear of third-placed West Ham with six games left, although their challenge for the Football League title is coming under threat from Reading, who stand two points behind. Birmingham (with a game in hand), Blackpool and Brighton make up the play-off places, with Middlesbrough only outside on goal difference.

14 April 2012: Charlton Athletic become the first League side to gain promotion after a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win at Carlisle United meant that Charlton were promoted and would be playing Championship football in 2012/13 after a three-year exile.

17 April 2012: Reading are promoted back to the Premier League after a four-year exile by beating Nottingham Forest 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 at home.73
21 April 2012: Already-relegated Doncaster Rovers drag Coventry City down to League One with them by winning 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the Championship clash at the Ricoh Arena, meaning that the midlanders will be playing third tier football next season for the first time in nearly 50 years.74 Portsmouth's relegation is also confirmed by a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 home defeat by Derby County, a mere two years after being in the Premier League and four years after winning the FA Cup.75 Rochdale become the first League One side of the season to suffer relegation, after losing 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 at Chesterfield, whose victory keeps their own survival hopes alive.76 Swindon Town seal promotion from League Two despite a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 defeat at Gillingham,77 Shrewsbury's chances of sealing promotion are put on hold by a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw at Accrington.78
22 April 2012: Wolves are relegated from the Premier League after a three-year stay with a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 home defeat to Manchester City, whose title hopes are kept alive by Manchester United being held to a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;4 draw at Old Trafford by Everton.79
28 April 2012: Southampton are promoted to the Premier League after a seven-year exile, achieving promotion for the second year running.80 Shrewsbury Town secure automatic promotion to League One.81 Macclesfield Town drop back into the Conference after 15 years in the Football League.82
30 April 2012: April ends with Manchester City top of the Premier League after a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 home win over rivals Manchester United, who are level on point with City but wield an inferior goal difference &lt;U+2013&gt; both have two games left to play. The race for the last two Champions League places is reaching its climax, with five points separating Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle and Chelsea, although Arsenal have played one game more. However, should Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League final the West London side will automatically qualify for the Champions League regardless of their final place in the table. Everton's belated challenge for European qualification is over; the sole remaining aim of the season is to finish above archrivals Liverpool, who are two points behind in eighth. Wolves have already been mathematically relegated, while Blackburn and Bolton (the latter with a game in hand) remain in the bottom three, but QPR, Wigan and Aston Villa are not yet certain of safety.83 In the Championship, Reading and Southampton have achieved promotion to the Premier League. West Ham, Birmingham, Blackpool and Cardiff will compete in the play-offs, while Portsmouth, Coventry and Doncaster are relegated.84
1 May 2012: Roy Hodgson of West Bromwich Albion is confirmed as the next England Manager.85 Manchester City go top of the Premier League on goal difference with two games remaining with a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 home win over United.86

In League Two Crawley Town won back to back promotions to League One with a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory at Accrington Stanley.89 Southend United, Torquay United, Cheltenham Town and Crewe Alexandra make up the Play-Offs. At the other end of the table Barnet survived to fight another season in League Two after beating Burton Albion, this result condemned Hereford United to Conference Football next season.90
6 May 2012: Manchester City remain top of the Premier League with a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win at Newcastle United, but their neighbours remain level on points with them by beating Swansea 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 at Old Trafford.91
7 May 2012: Blackburn are relegated from the Premier League after a 1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 home defeat to Wigan Athletic, ending an 11-year stint in the top flight &lt;U+2013&gt; the result confirms Wigan's Premier League status for an eighth successive season. Bolton Wanderers occupy the final remaining relegation place and need to win their final game of the season to stand any chance of survival. The only other team in real danger of relegation are QPR, as Aston Villa's much better goal difference means that they will almost certainly stay up.92
13 May 2012: Manchester City scored twice in stoppage time to be crowned champions for the first time in 44 years as they beat Queen's Park Rangers to win the Premier League on goal difference from Manchester United. In scenes of near bedlam, City looked to be suffering a dramatic collapse as QPR - safe after Stoke City drew with Bolton - held on to an unlikely advantage with United leading at Sunderland. Edin Dzeko equalised in the second of five minutes of stoppage time before Sergio Aguero scored the goal that won the title.93

Premier League
In one of the most memorable finishes to a season in recent memory, Manchester City ended a 44-year wait to win their first Premier League title on goal difference. The off-field antics of controversial bad-boy striker Mario Balotelli, coupled with the exile of fellow striker Carlos T&lt;U+00E9&gt;vez for refusing to warm up during a Champions League game had threatened to derail their title challenge. But Roberto Mancini welcomed Tevez back into the fold, the gamble ultimately paying off as City won their final 6 games while cross-city neighbours Manchester United squandered an eight-point lead in what was largely a trophyless season for Sir Alex Ferguson's men for the first time in 6 years. Arsenal recovered from a terrible start to the season to take third place, while striker Robin van Persie won the Players' Player of the Year Award by scoring 30 goals. Chelsea's European Cup triumph under Roberto Di Matteo ensured Champions League football for the 10th consecutive time, meaning that 4th placed Tottenham had to settle for a Europa League place instead.
Newcastle finished 5th to also qualify for the Europa League, recording their first top 6 finish in 8 years under Alan Pardew, who won the Manager of the Year award. Liverpool recorded their lowest Premier League finish since 1994; their season marred by striker Luis Su&lt;U+00E1&gt;rez racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra during a league game. They put this incident behind them by winning the League Cup, ending five consecutive seasons without winning a major trophy. Kenny Dalglish was sacked 3 days after the end of the season following a poor run of 13 points from their remaining 14 games.
For only the second time in Premier League history, all three promoted teams survived, though all finished in the bottom half. Swansea City were the pundit's choice to be relegated, but they defied their critics with their own unique style of football and claimed shock victories over the likes of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool to finish a respectable 11th. Norwich City finished below them in 12th, impressing on their return to the top flight. Queens Park Rangers were left needing to rely on other results on the last day to help them survive, though a run of 19 points from their last nine home fixtures played some part in their survival.
The sacking of Mick McCarthy and appointment of first team coach Terry Connor ended Wolverhampton Wanderers' three-year spell in the top-flight, a terrible second half to the season saw them take just 4 points from 13 games and they finished bottom. Having been clear of the relegation zone at the start of April, Blackburn Rovers were also undone by poor late-season form; losing 8 of their last 9 games to finish second bottom as growing anger from the supporters toward owners Venky's and manager Steve Kean continued. Bolton Wanderers, who coincidentally had been promoted alongside Blackburn in 2001, went down on the last day of the season.
Leading goalscorer: Robin van Persie (Arsenal) &lt;U+2013&gt; 30
Championship
A year after suffering heartbreak in the play-off final, an excellent run of 50 points from their remaining 21 games saw Reading crowned divisional champions, earning promotion to the top flight for only the second time in their history. Having been in the top two for the majority of the season, Southampton finished in the runners-up spot to claim their second successive promotion, returning to the Premier League after a seven-year absence as their revival under Nigel Adkins continued, one year after Norwich won a second successive promotion. West Ham United, who lost out to Southampton on the last day of the season, won promotion via the play-offs, with manager Sam Allardyce passing his former clubs Blackburn and Bolton on the way up.
Doncaster Rovers' luck finally ran out after four years of operating on the division's lowest budget, and they were relegated in bottom place. 11 years after dropping out of the Premier League, Coventry City finally hit rock bottom as they suffered from an ongoing financial crisis and the loss of several key players pre-season, their never-ending downward spiral culminating in relegation to the third tier for the first time since 1964. Portsmouth fell back into financial difficulties and went into administration for the second time in three seasons, with the resulting ten point deduction dealing a fatal blow to their survival hopes and sending them down to League One (had it not been for Portsmouth's points deduction, Barnsley would have been the third relegated side).
&lt;U+2021&gt;Portsmouth deducted 10 points for entering administration.98

League One
Chris Powell's first season in charge of Charlton earned the Addicks promotion at the third time of asking, leading the division for virtually the entire season to win the title with a club record of 101 points. The two Sheffield clubs contested the second automatic promotion spot; United were in the top two for most of the season, but struggled with form after top scorer Ched Evans was imprisoned for rape, allowing Wednesday to claim second place and a return to the Championship after a two-year absence. It was ultimately to be another Yorkshire side, Huddersfield Town, who were victorious over United in the play-offs, meaning they would be playing in the second tier for the first time since 2001.
After equalling their highest league finish last season, the departure of Keith Hill to Barnsley during the summer meant that Rochdale finished bottom, bringing their long-awaited spell in League One to an end after just two years. Exeter City also failed to build on their near-miss of the previous season's play-offs and finished second bottom, returning to League Two after three years. Chesterfield couldn't adjust to life in the third tier and they too were relegated, despite winning the Football League Trophy. Wycombe Wanderers, who finished six points behind the Spireites last season, didn't last long either, and they also suffered immediate relegation back to League Two.
Leading goalscorer: Jordan Rhodes (Huddersfield) &lt;U+2013&gt; 36
League Two
Swindon Town made an immediate return to League One, as Paolo Di Canio won the League Two title in his first season as a manager. Shrewsbury took the runners-up spot, going the entire season unbeaten at home and earning veteran manager Graham Turner his second promotion with the club 33 years after his first. Crawley Town were the third automatically promoted team, and earned their second successive promotion. Despite the resignation of legendary manager Dario Gradi early in the season, Crewe Alexandra rallied under new manager Steve Davis and won promotion via the play-offs.
Macclesfield Town dropped out of the Football League after fifteen years, ultimately being undone by a horrific second half of the season in which they didn't win a single game after the turn of the year. Hereford United suffered their second relegation from the League on the last day of the season, with Barnet securing last-day survival for the third season in a row.
Joining the League for the following season were newcomers Fleetwood Town, and York City, who returned to the League after an eight-year absence.
&lt;U+2021&gt;Port Vale deducted 10 points for entering administration.99
Leading goalscorers: Jack Midson (AFC Wimbledon), Izale McLeod (Barnet), Lewis Grabban (Rotherham United), and Adebayo Akinfenwa (Northampton Town) &lt;U+2013&gt; 18
