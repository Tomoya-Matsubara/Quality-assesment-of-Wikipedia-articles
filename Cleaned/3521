Medal count
This is the full table of the medal count of the 2006 Winter Olympics, based on the medal count of the International Olympic Committee IOC. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC.
The host country Italy is highlighted in lavender blue and the greatest number of medals in each medal category gold, silver, bronze, and total is in boldface.
