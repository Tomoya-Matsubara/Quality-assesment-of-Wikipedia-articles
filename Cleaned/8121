 Trevor David Pinnock CBE (born 16 December 1946) is an English conductor and harpsichordist. He is best known for directing the period-performance orchestra The English Concert from the harpsichord for over 30 years in baroque and early classical music.
Biography and career
Early life
Trevor Pinnock was born in Canterbury, where his grandfather had run a Salvation Army band. His father was Kenneth Alfred Thomas Pinnock, a publisher, his mother, Joyce Edith, n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Muggleton, was an amateur singer.12 He is left-handed. He became a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral when he was 7, attending the choir school from 1956 to 1961 and later Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys.34 After receiving instruction in piano and organ, he served as a church organist; by the time he was 15, he had begun to play the harpsichord.5 At age 19, he entered the Royal College of Music, on a Foundation Scholarship for organ and later studied harpsichord, winning the major prizes for performance on both instruments.67 His teachers were Ralph Downes and Millicent Silver.8 A strong early influence was Gustav Leonhardt, though he did not study with him.9
Directing from the harpsichord
As a harpsichordist, he toured Europe with the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.10 While a student at the RCM, he was told by the registrar, John Stainer, that it would be impossible to make a living as a harpsichordist.11 To maximise his possibilities for work early on in his career, he included in his repertoire not only the regular baroque repertoire, but also modern harpsichord concertos including Roberto Gerhard's concerto for harpsichord, percussion and strings, Manuel de Falla's concerto for harpsichord, Frank Martin's Petite symphonie concertante for harp, harpsichord, piano and double string orchestra and Francis Poulenc's Concert Champ&lt;U+00EA&gt;tre.1213
He made his London debut at the Royal Festival Hall in 1966 with the Galliard Harpsichord Trio, which he co-founded with Stephen Preston, flute, and Anthony Pleeth, cello. At this stage, they were playing baroque music on modern instruments.14 His solo harpsichord debut was in 1968 at the Purcell Room in London.15 In November 1972 the Galliard Trio expanded to become The English Concert, an orchestra specialising in performances of baroque and early classical music on period instruments.1617 They initially started with seven people but soon grew in size. The decision to move to period performance was taken for a number of reasons:18   Trevor Pinnock was at the forefront of the period performance movement and the revitalisation of the baroque repertoire; the reaction of Leonard Bernstein to his performances is typical: &quot;In my opinion, the work of the conductor Trevor Pinnock in this area is particularly exciting - his performances of Bach and Handel make me jump out of my seat!&quot;19
The English Concert's London debut was at the English Bach Festival in 1973.20 In 1975, Pinnock played the harpsichord in the first ever performance of Rameau's last opera, Les Bor&lt;U+00E9&gt;ades, under John Eliot Gardiner.21 He toured North America with The English Concert for the first time in 1983; he had earlier spent two periods as Artist in Residence at Washington University, St. Louis.22 His debut at The Proms was in 1980; he later directed Handel's Solomon in 1986 and many other large-scale works with his orchestra.23 They toured worldwide and made numerous recordings, Pinnock directing &quot;with a characteristic energy and enthusiasm which are readily communicated to audiences.&quot;24 The Choir of the English Concert was at first an ad-hoc group of singers assembled as needed, originally in 1983 for the first performance this century of Rameau's Acante et C&lt;U+00E9&gt;phise; it became a standing choir in the mid-1990s at the time they were performing Bach's Mass in B minor. This allowed the ensemble to regularly perform baroque operas, oratorios and other vocal works; a series of Bach's major choral works followed.2526
He directed The English Concert, usually from the harpsichord or chamber organ,27 for over 30 years, deciding, with the other orchestra members, to hand it over to violinist Andrew Manze in 2003.2829 He explained the decision as follows:30
New conducting projects
He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1988 conducting Handel's opera Giulio Cesare, the same year he made his debut at the Salzburg Festival with Handel's Messiah.3132 In 1989 he founded The Classical Band in New York, signing an 18-disc recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon before the ensemble's first rehearsal.33 He led the group in performances of the classical repertoire from Haydn to Mendelssohn on period instruments, including playing as fortepiano soloist.34 After a disappointing series of concerts, he resigned in 1990 and was succeeded by Bruno Weil.35
From 1991-1996 he was artistic director and principal conductor of the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, a group he had first directed in 1985.36 He subsequently served as its artistic advisor during the 1996-1997 and 1997-1998 seasons, including a tour of the USA with the performance and recording of Beethoven's 1st and 5th piano concertos with Grigory Sokolov as soloist.37
He conducted Opera Australia and Michael Chance in Handel's Rinaldo at the Sydney Opera House in 2005.38 He also played William Babell's virtuoso harpsichord transcriptions with some of the arias (which Babell claimed were of Handel's actual improvisations).39
With the European Brandenburg Ensemble, a baroque orchestra founded by him to mark his 60th birthday, he is touring Europe, Asia and America in 2007. Founded to perform Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, they are playing a wide variety of the core baroque repertoire.40414243
Guest conducting
He has appeared frequently as a guest conductor with many of the world's leading orchestras, including the Boston, Birmingham, San Francisco and Detroit symphony orchestras, the Saint Paul, Los Angeles and Mito44 chamber orchestras, the Freiburger Barockorchester, Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra,45 Mozarteum Orchestra of Salzburg, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, and at the Tanglewood, Mostly Mozart and Salzburg festivals.46 He is a regular guest conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie, and principal guest conductor of the Royal Academy of Music's Baroque Orchestra and Chorus.4748
Recent years
Trevor Pinnock directs the European Brandenburg Ensemble
In 2004 he commissioned modern harpsichord music by English composer John Webb: Surge (2004), &quot;is built up over an implacable rhythmic repeat-figure. Though neither is explicitly tonal, each skilfully avoids the merely percussive effect that the harpsichord's complex overtones can all too easily impart to more densely dissonant music.&quot; He has also played the same composer's Ebb (2000), which &quot;comprises a spasmodic discourse against a manic background of descending scale patterns like a kind of out-of-kilter change-ringing.&quot;49
Trevor Pinnock and Maxim Vengerov toured together in 2000, with Vengerov taking up the baroque violin for the first time and Pinnock taking up the modern grand piano. These concerts consisted of a first half of harpsichord and baroque violin, followed by a 2nd half of piano and modern violin.5051
Today he divides his time between performing as a harpsichordist and conducting both modern- and period-instrument orchestras.52
His next recording project will be the Bach flute sonatas together with Emmanuel Pahud.
