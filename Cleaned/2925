liligo.com is a search engine that specialises in travel. Launched in 2006, the website allows users to compare travel products (flight tickets, hotels, holidays, car hires) in order to find the cheapest price. It can also be categorised as a comparison shopping website.1
Searches are made from hundreds of travel agencies, airlines, hotel chains, booking sites, tour operators and car hire agencies&lt;U+2026&gt;
The site is also available in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Hungarian and Romanian.
History
liligo.com is a production of Findworks Technologies, a start-up founded by Pierre Bonelli, Bertrand de la Ruelle, Xavier Corbel and Mika&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Quilfen in 2005. Based in Paris and Budapest in Hungary, the company currently employs around 50 people.
In May 2009, the site launched its first television ad2.
In September 2010, SNCF, via its site Voyages-sncf, announced it would take a major stake in liligo.com for the amount of 20 million Euros, according to Les Echos.3 liligo.com was resold 3 years later to European tourism giant .
Technology
Using Java and Ajax technology,]4 the site allows users to search for travel products (flight tickets, hotels, etc.) from among a number of online travel agencies. It distinguished itself early on for its use of widgets.5.
liligo.com sells nothing but instead redirects users to the supplier site of the selected offer. A price calendar allows users to compare flight prices over several months in order to find the cheapest time of the year to travel. Creating an alert warns users of rising or dropping prices for desired flight routes. Finally, the price map gives users the possibility to find the best flights according to different criteria (journey duration, expected temperature, maximum price).
Mobile and tablet applications are also available.67
Performance
Available in 11 European countries, liligo.com attracts more than 3 million unique visitors per month and distinguishes itself from other meta-search sites by displaying real-time flight prices that include all additional fees (credit card fee, booking fee&lt;U+2026&gt;) and also searches low cost airlines.8 Website traffic has steadily increased since its launch in 2006.
With more than 50 million searches made in 2013, traffic has doubled since 2010 and has increased by 30% compared to 2012.9
