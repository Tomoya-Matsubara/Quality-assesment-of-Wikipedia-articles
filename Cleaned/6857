Its motto is the Greek phrase &quot;&lt;U+0388&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03CE&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+039A&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03CE&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;,&quot; which translates to &quot;Achieve the Honorable.&quot;
History
Founded in 1834 as the Worcester County Manual Labor High School, it did not change its name until 1847. The school moved to its current location on Union Hill in Worcester in 1869. Worcester Academy was all-male from its founding until 1856, and again from 1890 to 1974. It has been coeducational since.
Campus
  Worcester Academy's campus is currently spread over four main parcels: the main campus, which contains approximately twelve acres; Francis A. Gaskill Field, a twelve-acre parcel two blocks from the main campus; and the New Balance Fields on Stafford Street, comprising about thirty acres. Worcester Academy also recently relocated some of its offices and alumni facilities to a renovated Victorian home two blocks from the main campus. In 2006, Worcester Academy signed a purchase and sale agreement to purchase an additional thirteen acres between Gaskill Field and the main campus, with the intent of creating a new indoor athletic complex.
On the main campus, several beautiful brick buildings are listed on the national historic register, including Chester W. Kingsley Laboratories, Joseph H. Walker Hall, Reverend Robert J. Adams Hall, and William H. Dexter Hall. The headmaster lives in the Daniel W. Abercrombie House, named for the principal of Worcester Academy from 1882 to 1918.
One of the most famous and remarkable architectural buildings on the campus is the Lewis J. Warner Memorial Theater, a gift from Warner Brothers Studio President Harry Warner. He donated the building in memory of his son Lewis Warner '28, who died shortly after graduating from the academy. The Academy's formal student assemblies are held in Warner Theater to this day, though the theater is no longer able to seat the entire middle and upper school student bodies at once.
