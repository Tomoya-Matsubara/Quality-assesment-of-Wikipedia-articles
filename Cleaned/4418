X1 sailing upwind on the Alster, Hamburg.
The X1 is a fast, light-weight sailing dinghy designed for sailing on rivers, estuaries and inland waters by Phil Morrison. The dinghy is sailed by 2 or 3 people and has a main, a jib and a symmetric_spinnaker. The boat is designed to be easily driven in very light wind, easy to sail and rig and quick to tack.1 It has a PY of 949.. Currently the PY is the same as an RS400 but can perform better in light wind and slower in heavier winds.
The X0 is a variant of the original X1 with the same hull etc. but a smaller rig. The mast and three sails are different and can easily be substituted. This version is intended for beginners or lighter weight crew. Differences in specification: Mast height: , Sail area - Main and Jib: , Sail area - Spinnaker: .
Race results include 3rd and 4th in the 2013 Three Rivers Race on the Norfolk Broads2 , 1st in Reinwoche and Letzte Helden 2012 - Hamburg.
The X1 was boat tested by Yachts &amp; Yachting3 and Yachting Life 4. The X0 by Yacht 5
