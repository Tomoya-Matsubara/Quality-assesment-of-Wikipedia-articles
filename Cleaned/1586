Nomination to First Circuit
On January 23, 2012, President Obama nominated Kayatta to serve as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.11 He received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 14, 2012,12 and his nomination was reported to the floor on April 19, 2012, by voice vote, with Senator Sessions and Senator Lee recorded as voting no.13
Kayatta's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was uncontroversial.14 His nomination needed only confirmation by the full Senate, but the process was stalled by GOP filibusters for a series of tactical reasons, such as to block the consideration of another of President Obama's judicial appointments, Robert E. Bacharach.15 With the adjournment of the Senate session on January 2, 2013, the nomination expired.
On January 3, 2013, he was renominated to the same office.16 On February 7, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the floor by voice vote, with Senator Jeff Sessions recorded as a no vote.17 The Senate confirmed his nomination on February 13, 2013, by a vote of 88 ayes to 12 nays.18 He received his commission on February 14, 2013.19 Kayatta will fill the seat vacated by Judge Kermit Lipez, who took senior status at the end of 2011.20
