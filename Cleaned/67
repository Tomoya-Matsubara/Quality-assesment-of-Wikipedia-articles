Diaspora Yeshiva Band () was an Orthodox Jewish band founded at the Diaspora Yeshiva on Mount Zion, Jerusalem, by baal teshuva students from the United States. In existence from 1975 to 1983, the band infused rock and bluegrass with Jewish lyrics, creating a style of music it called &quot;Hasidic rock&quot; or &quot;Country and Eastern&quot;.12 The band was very popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s, and was famous in Jerusalem for its Saturday-night concerts at David's Tomb. It had a considerable influence on contemporary Jewish religious music, inspiring later bands such as Blue Fringe, Even Sh'siyah, Piamenta, Reva l'sheva, Soulfarm, the Moshav Band, and Shlock Rock. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revamped the band under the name &quot;Avraham Rosenblum &amp; Diaspora&quot; and produced several more albums.
Background
The Diaspora Yeshiva was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva in Queens, New York, and a colleague of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. The Diaspora Yeshiva was the first outreach yeshiva for baalei teshuva. Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional Torah or Talmud study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle. To appeal to students who identified with the hippie subculture prevalent on college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a neo-Hasidic approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.
Numerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.3 In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.4 The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using Jewish music to draw them into the milieu of Torah study.5
History
The Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the Beit Ha'am hall in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem during Hanukkah 1975.6 After that, the band became well-known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to David's Tomb (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.7 These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth; yeshiva and seminary students; and Israeli soldiers.8 Band members continued to perform with the group even after they had married and begun studying in kollel.9
The band released its first album in 1976.10 In 1977 it was invited to compete in the Hasidic Song Festival, an Israeli contest that ran from 1969 to 1984 and that was broadcast on national television.11 Diaspora was the first yeshiva band to perform in the largely secular music event, and won first prize for its song &quot;Hu Yiftach Libeinu&quot; (He will open our hearts).12 Interviews in the general media followed, increasing name recognition and visitors to the Saturday-night concerts.13 The band was invited back for the 1978 Hasidic Song Festival, and won first prize for its song &quot;Malchutcha&quot; (Your sovereignty).14
The band embarked on its first North American concert tour in 1979, visiting 26 cities.15 It went on to tour the U.S., Canada, Europe, and South Africa on five additional tours.1617 The band was highly popular on college campuses in the early to mid-1980s.18
In the 1980s, Lynard Skynard drummer Artimus Pyle came to study in the Diaspora Yeshiva for several years.19 He played with the band and bequeathed his drum set to the yeshiva.2021 In 1987 the Diaspora Yeshiva Band performed and was interviewed on MTV's Musical Passport series, Rock Israel, as part of the coverage of the visit of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers to Israel and Egypt.2223 Band leader Avraham Rosenblum was filmed accompanying Tom Petty, Benmont Tench, and Roger McGuinn at the Western Wall.24
The Diaspora Yeshiva Band released a total of six albums.2526 It disbanded in 19832728 as its members began pursuing both solo careers and careers in Torah learning and outreach.29
Reunions
In December 1992 the band reconvened for a month-long30 reunion tour beginning with a performance at Carnegie Hall.3132 It reunited again in 1996 with a show at The Town Hall in New York City.33
In 2014, Rosenblum, Abramson, Goldstein, Harris, and Herman performed at the HASC 27 concert at Lincoln Center.3435 That same year, the group held another reunion concert at Congregation Shomrei Emunah in Baltimore, where Rosenblum is a member.36
Avraham Rosenblum &amp; Diaspora
In 1998 band leader Avraham Rosenblum and his son, drummer Moe Rosenblum, revamped the band under the name &quot;Avraham Rosenblum &amp; Diaspora&quot; and produced the album Jerusalem is Calling.373839 The pair went on to produce The Diaspora Collection (2000), a digitally-remastered double-CD of Diaspora Yeshiva Band hits, and Kedem (2003), an album featuring solo material by Avraham Rosenblum.404142
Music style
The band members viewed their music as a means of expressing their newfound connection to God, the Jewish people, and the Land of Israel in a medium that they were familiar with.4344 Their arrangements reflected the musical trends of secular American culture in the late 1960s and early 1970s.45 The band's repertoire included rock, soft rock, acid rock, country, bluegrass, blues, folk, jazz, klezmer, and Yiddish ballads.464748 Strom describes their music as blending &quot;a San Francisco rock 'n' roll sound with Israeli, Middle Eastern, and Hasidic music&quot;.
Instrumentation included electric guitar, rhythm guitar, bass guitar, saxophone, fiddle, banjo, and drums.4950 The band was noted for its guitar harmonies51 and &quot;virtuoso&quot; instrument playing.5253
The lyrics, in contrast, expressed Jewish values. Lyrics were both original and drawn from the Torah and Book of Psalms.5455 The band sang in Hebrew, Yiddish, and English. Their on-stage presence also belied the traditional rock band image: they sported full beards, payot, and tzitzit, and dressed in the dark-colored attire typical of yeshiva students.5657
Influence
The Diaspora Yeshiva Band was considered an influential group in the history of contemporary Jewish religious music.58 Bands that name them as an inspiration include Blue Fringe,59 8th Day,60 and Shlock Rock.6162 Besides Rosenblum, other original band members who pursued musical careers are Ruby Harris, founder of the Ruby Harris Electric Violin Blues Band in Chicago,63 Adam Wexler, co-founder of Reva l'sheva,64 and Rabbi Moshe Shur, founder of the Moshe Shur Band and Moshe Shur and Sons.65 Sons of original band member Ben Zion Solomon founded Soulfarm, the Moshav Band, and HaMakor.666768
