I'm Your Baby Tonight is the third studio album by American pop and R&amp;B recording artist Whitney Houston. It was released by Arista Records on November 6, 1990. Following the run of this album, Houston continued to achieve widespread commercial success throughout the 1990s, venturing heavily into films&lt;U+2014&gt;while continuing to record via their adjoining soundtrack albums. Subsequently, I'm Your Baby Tonight would not be followed up with another studio album until 1998's My Love Is Your Love.
Background
Like many artists, Houston's previous efforts featured material mostly chosen by the label. With this project, however, she had more control over the album's content. In addition to working with the previous producers of Narada Michael Walden and Michael Masser, she also worked with the production team of L.A. Reid and Babyface, as well as singer Luther Vandross, and did a collaboration with Stevie Wonder. Houston would also produce the song &quot;I'm Knockin'&quot;, with tour music director Ricky Minor and co-write the song &quot;Takin' a Chance&quot;.
Music
I'm Your Baby Tonight features funk and dance-driven pop music. The Walden-produced songs are divided by contemporary dance-pop tracks and ornate ballads, while Reid and Babyface's productions reappropriate 1970s black pop and danceable funk with aggressive 1980s dance rhythms.1 According to Allmusic's Ashley S. Battel, Houston &quot;attempts to make a larger foray into dance music&quot; with this album,2 while David Browne observed light synthesizer flourishes, thumping drum beats, and &quot;dance-fever settings&quot; throughout.3 James Hunter of Rolling Stone described the album as &quot;a case study in how much [Houston] can get out of her luscious and straightforward vocal gifts within a dancepop framework.&quot;4 J. D. Considine wrote that Houston's singing on the album features &quot;sultry moans, note-bending asides, [and] window-rattling gospel shouts&quot;.5 Rolling Stone magazine's Jim Macnie said that the album &quot;displayed a slick R&amp;B edge.&quot;6
