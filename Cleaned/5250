 This list of tallest buildings in Portland, Oregon ranks skyscrapers in the U.S. city of Portland, Oregon. The tallest building in Portland is currently the 41-story Wells Fargo Center, which rises 546 feet (166 m).1 The building has been the tallest skyscraper in the State of Oregon since its completion in 1972.2 The second-tallest building in Portland is the US Bancorp Tower, which rises 536 feet (163 m) and 42 floors.3 The building is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;Big Pink&quot; for its similarly colored granite exterior.4
Portland's history of skyscrapers is generally thought to begin in 1907 with the completion of the Wells Fargo Building.56 Since then, over 100 highrise buildings have been constructed in the city, with the majority being completed between 1970 and 2000.78 No Portland buildings are among the tallest in the United States, but the city is home to three buildings over 500 feet (152 m).9 Overall, Portland's skyline is ranked (based on existing and under construction buildings over 500 feet (152 m) tall) second in the Northwest (after Seattle), fifth in the Pacific Coast region (after Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Las Vegas), and 25th in the United States.
The city is undergoing an era of highrise construction, especially in the South Waterfront area, where several residential towers and an office building have been built over the past few years, including the John Ross Tower.101112 More residential buildings will be built close to the Willamette River as development of the South Waterfront progresses.13 Meanwhile, in Downtown Portland, Park Avenue West Tower, a 33-story skyscraper, is scheduled to break ground.14 At 515 feet (157 m) with its spires included, Park Avenue West would be Portland's first skyscraper over 500 feet (152 m) since 1984 and become the third-tallest building in the city upon completion.15
