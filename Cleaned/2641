He averaged 21 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, and led the team to a conference championship behind a 22-4 record.1
Following his high school years, Qvale was listed as a two-star recruit by Rivals.com and 247Sports.com. On August 17, 2006, he committed to Montana, and officially enrolled with University of Montana on June 30, 2007. He also considered Boise State, Colorado State, Portland State, Utah State, Washington State and Wyoming as possible college choices.
College career
With the Montana Grizzlies, Qvale was recognized as one of the premier centers in the Big Sky Conference. He led the team in blocks in his true freshman season, and ranked fourth in rebounding. In his sophomore year, Qvale was tied for being the top rebounder on Montana, and recorded his first double-double in the season opener against Colorado State. He was awarded the John Eaheart Memorial Award, given to the most outstanding defensive player on the team, after finishing his second season with 1.8 blocks per game. As a junior in 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10, Qvale earned the title as the team's top rebounder and was second in blocks in the Big Sky. He also ranked 47th in the NCAA Division I under the category. He earned the John Eaheart Award for the second consecutive season. Prior to his final year with the Grizzlies, Qvale received comments from head coach Wayne Tinkle, who said, &quot;Brian is a guy who we saw grow up right before our eyes in the second half of the season, especially down the stretch. He's carrying himself a lot differently. He's got more pep in his step and he's a lot more confident. He knows that he is the man for us, and needs to be kind of like our enforcer as well as our go-to guy. If he stays comfortable in that role, we look for Brian to have just a huge senior season. A lot of our success will be based around a lot of what he can do on both ends of the floor for us.&quot; Qvale finished his stint with Montana averaging a team-high 7.1 rebounds per game, and became the second-leading scorer with 10.2 points each game. He ranked as one of the top shot-blockers in Big Sky Conference history.2
Professional career
On June 8, 2011, Qvale signed a one-year deal with Alia&lt;U+011F&gt;a Petkim of the Turkish Basketball League.3 His decision was reportedly made partly due to the NBA lockout, on which he said, &quot;That's why I'm taking this as an opportunity to make some money and to get some experience at the pro level. Then I can come back next year or try to move up to a team over there.&quot;4
