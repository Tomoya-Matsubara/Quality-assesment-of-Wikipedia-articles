The popularity of the first-person shooter computer game Doom has resulted in a large number of spin-offs and homages.
Spin-offs
A set of four novels based on Doom were written with permission of id Software by Dafydd Ab Hugh and Brad Linaweaver. The books, listed in order, are titled Knee Deep in the Dead, Hell on Earth, Infernal Sky and Endgame. All were published between June 1995 and January 1996 by Pocket Books. Some in the Doom community started calling the unnamed marine in the games &quot;Flynn Taggart&quot;, after the main character of the novels, at least for a time. The first two books featured recognizable locations and situations from the first two games.
 Additionally, a comic book was issued in May 1996, produced by Tom Grindberg of Marvel Comics as a giveaway for a video game convention, and original art from that project was put up for auction on eBay in April of 2004. It was criticized for ridiculous dialogue and a poor story, as well as erroneous representations of some weapons from the game. In September of 2005, a member of the Doom community released an unofficial &quot;dramatic rendition&quot; of the lines from the comic, with music and sound effects, for comedic effect. Notable lines include &quot;Now I'm radioactive! That can't be good!&quot;, &quot;Sweet Christmas! Big-mouthed floating thingies! It's always something!&quot;, and (pictured below) the infamous &quot;Rip and tear your guts! You are huge! That means you have huge guts!&quot;.
On January 31 of 2005, a board game resembling the classic Space Hulk was released, entitled Doom: The Board Game. 1
There is also a movie based on Doom.

Homages
In games
In Jazz Jackrabbit 2, in the episode-selection screen, the player is allowed to try the shareware demo of the game. The episode screen is a parody of the Doom II box-art and even the text &quot;Shareware Demo&quot; is written using the Doom font. This is ironic since the game was released by Epic, the creator of Unreal and the biggest competitor of id's Quake franchise.
Duke Nukem 3D contains a reference to Doom: a slaughtered &quot;Doom Guy&quot; that causes Duke to say &quot;Hmmmm, that's one Doomed space marine&quot;.
Quake 3 features the Doomguy as a playable character - he is referred to simply as &quot;Doom&quot;. The same model, with a different skin, is used for the character &quot;Phobos&quot;.
The PC release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features the Doomguy as a secret skater.
Numerous unofficial maps have been made by players of newer games that recreate maps from Doom and Doom II.
The PC game Muppets Inside features a Doom parody starring the Swedish Chef taking on giant killer vegetables with various kitchenware.
In the Simpsons game Virtual Springfield there is a minigame with a parody of Doom in which Apu fights off squishee-throwing bullies in his shop with a broom, shotgun and a weapon similar the BFG, causing them to explode in a bloody mess (but, for some reason, ending the game and supposedly killing the in-game Apu).
In fiction
Doom, as well as Labyrinth of Death (&lt;U+041B&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt; &lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;), a fictional virtual reality multiplayer game inspired by Doom ideas and images, is extensively featured in the &quot;Labyrinth of Reflections&quot; trilogy by Russian author Sergey Lukyanenko.
In a Simpsons Comic, the nerds from Springfield University become rich after a computer game resembling Doom (but with Homer as the marine) is accidentally uploaded onto the Internet by Bart.

In television

The game was shown briefly during an episode of Family Guy (Season 4B, Episode 4, &quot;PTV&quot;).

During this sequence, Stewie drives through the fifth level of Doom and rams an Imp, killing it.

In movies

Wild Hogs: When the police officer is describing how he acquired his badge over the internet, he says &quot;for firearms training, they just told us to play Doom&quot;. After the large battle at the end of the film, he also says &quot;wow, that was like, level twelve of Doom&quot;.

The Smashing Pumpkins credit id Software for the Doom rocket launcher sound effect which is used as a sample on the song &quot;Where Boys Fear to Tread&quot; off the album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.
