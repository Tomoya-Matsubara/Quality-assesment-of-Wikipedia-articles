The Right Reverend David Standish Ball (born June 11, 1926) was the seventh Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Albany in the United States from 1984 to 1998. 
Childhood, education and calling
David Standish Ball was born in June 1926 in Albany, New York, and attended The Milne School, a preparatory school in Albany. Ball served in the United States Navy during World War II. He graduated from Colgate University in 1950.1
He answered the call to holy orders in the Episcopal Church. He attended The General Theological Seminary in New York City during the 1950s.
He was ordained a deacon and priest in Albany, and served as a curate at Bethesda Church in Saratoga Springs, in upstate New York. He was elected Canon in 1956, serving until 1961 as Canon Ball. 2 He was then elected Dean of the Cathedral of All Saints in Albany in 1960, and served over two decades, through 1984. As an urban parish in a downtown neighborhood, that entailed what was called slum work.
Bishop of Albany
In 1984, Ball was elected Bishop coadjutor of Albany. He was consecrated under apostolic succession by Presiding Bishop John Maury Allin,3 bishop David E. Richards, formerly suffragan of Albany and then bishop of the Anglican diocese of Central America, and the incumbent sixth bishop Wilbur Emory Hogg.4 Upon bishop Hogg's retirement, Ball was installed in the cathedra in the choir at the Cathedral of All Saints, as the 7th Bishop of Albany.
David S. Ball served from 1984 to 1998 as the seventh Diocesan bishop of Albany. 5
Ball opposed female ordination in the 1970s, but later changed his position, serving with and ordaining female priests and deacons since at least 1989.6
He took part in several consecrations of other bishops, including that of his successors.7 8 He was considered a conservative on issues such as apostolic succession.9
In retirement
Upon his retirement, Ball was succeeded by then-bishop Daniel W. Herzog. Ball became active in the Alpha Christian movement10 and many other local charities. 11 The Bishop Ball Golf Tournament, an annual fundraiser for the Cathedral, is named in his honor. 12 The Doane Stuart School, on whose board he sat until mid-2008, has named a trustee award for him. 13 14
Ball continues to serve as Bishop-in Residence at the Cathedral of All Saints.15 In recent years, he has gained a reputation on such issues as ecumenism16 17 and alternate oversight in the Anglican Community. 18 19 20
In March 2007, Bena joined the Convocation of Anglicans in North America. Ball expressed concern at Bena's leave to the Anglican Convocation, 21 as well as to Herzog's return to the Roman Catholic Church, also in March 2007.22 23
