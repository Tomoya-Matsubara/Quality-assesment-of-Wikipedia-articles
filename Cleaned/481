calendars
Image:Hindu calendar 1871-72.jpg right 250px thumb A page from the Hindu calendar 1871-72.
The Hindu calendar used in ancient times has undergone many changes in the process of regionalization, and today there are several regional Indian calendars, as well as an Indian national calendar. In Pakistan it is called 'desi' or native calendar.
Most of these calendars are inherited from a system first enunciated in Vedanga Jyotisha of Lagadha, a late BCE adjunct to the Vedas, standardized in the Surya Siddhanta 3rd century CE and subsequently reformed by astronomers  such as Aryabhata 499 CE, Varahamihira 6th c. CE, and Bhaskara 12th c. CE.  There are differences and regional variations abound in these computations, but the following is a general overview of Hindu lunisolar calendar. 
Day
The Hindu calendrical day starts with local sunrise. It is allotted five properties, called anga-s. They are:
# the tithi active at sunrise
# the vaasara or weekday
# the nakshatra in which the moon resides at sunrise
# the yoga Hindu calendar yoga active at sunrise
# the karana Hindu calendar karana active at sunrise.
Together these are called the panchnga-s where pancha means five in Sanskrit. An explanation of the terms follows.
Tithi
The anticlockwise angular distance between the sun and moon as measured from the earth along the ecliptic circle on the sky in which the sun, moon and planets seem to move can vary between 0 and 360. This is divided into 30 parts. Each part ends at 12, 24 etc. The time spent by the moon in each of these parts i.e. the time taken for the angular distance to increase in steps of 12 starting from 0 is called one tithi.
The month has two paksha-s or fortnights. The first 15 tithi-s constitute the bright fortnight or shukla paksha and the next 15 tithi-s constitute the dark fortnight or krishna paksha. tithi-s are indicated by their paksha and ordinal number within the paksha. The 15th tithi of the bright fortnight full moon is called prnim and the 15th tithi of the dark fortnight new moon is called amvsy.
The tithi in which the moon is at the time of sunrise of a day is taken to be the tithi for the day.
Vaasara
Vaasara, often abbreviated as vaara in Sanskrit-derived languages,
refers to the days of the week, which are possibly of Sumerian/Babylonian origin

, and bear striking similarities with the names in many cultures:
; Following are the Hindi and English language English analogues  in parentheses:
# Ravi vsara ravi-vaara or Sunday; ravi = sun
# Soma vsara som-vaara or Monday; soma = moon
# Mangala vsara mangal-vaara or Tuesday; mangala = Mars
# Budha vsara budh-vaara or Wednesday; budh = Mercury planet Mercury
# Guru vsara guru-vaara or vrihaspati-vaara or Thursday; vrihaspati/guru = Jupiter
# Shukra vsara shukra-vaara or Friday; shukra = Venus
# Shani vsara shani-vaara or Saturday; shani = Saturn
There are many variations of these names in the regional languages, 
mostly using alternate names of the celestial bodies involved.
Nakshatra
Nakshatras
The ecliptic is divided into 27 nakshatras, which are variously called lunar houses or asterism astronomy asterisms. 
These reflect the moon's cycle against the fixed stars, 27 days and 7 hours, the fractional part being compensated by an intercalary 28th nakshatra. 
Nakshatra computation appears to have been well known at the time of the Rig Veda 2nd1st millennium BCE.
The ecliptic is divided into the nakshatras eastwards starting from a 
reference point which is traditionally a point on the ecliptic directly 
opposite the star Spica called Chitr in Sanskrit. Other slightly-different definitions exist. It is called Meshdi or the start of Aries astrology Aries; this is when the equinox  where the ecliptic meets the equator  was in Aries today it is in Pisces, 28 degrees before Aries starts.  The difference between Meshdi and the present equinox is known as ayanngsha or fraction of ecliptic.  Given the 25,800 year cycle for the precession of the equinoxes, the equinox was directly opposite Spica in 285 CE., around the date of the Surya Siddhanta

Note that nakshatra-s are in this context not just single stars but are segments on the ecliptic characterised by one or more stars. Hence there are more than one star mentioned for each nakshatra.

The nakshatra in which the moon lies at the time of sunrise of a day is the nakshatra for the day.
Yoga
Yoga computation involves dividing the sum of the longitudes of the sun and moon into 27 parts.  First one computes 
the angular distance along the ecliptic of each object, taking the ecliptic to start at Mesha or Aries Meshdi, as defined above: this is called the longitude of that object. 
The longitude of the sun and the longitude of the moon are added, and normalized to a value ranging between 0 to 360 if greater than 360, one subtracts 360. This sum is divided into 27 parts. Each part will now equal 800' where ' is the symbol of the arcminute which means 1/60 of a degree. These parts are called the yoga-s. They are labeled:
# Vishkambha
# Prti
# yushmn
# Saubhgya
# Shobhana
# Atiganda
# Sukarman
# Dhriti
# Shla
# Ganda
# Vriddhi
# Dhruva
# Vyghta
# Harshana
# Vajra
# Siddhi
# Vyatpta
# Varigha
# Parigha
# Shiva
# Siddha
# Sdhya
# Shubha
# Shukla
# Brhma
# Mhendra
# Vaidhriti
Again, minor variations may exist. The yoga that is active during sunrise of a day is the yoga for the day.
Karana
A karana is half of a #tithi tithi. To be precise, a karana is the time required for the angular distance between the sun and the moon to increase in steps of 6 starting from 0. Compare with the definition of a tithi above.
Since the tithi-s are thirty in number, one would expect there to be sixty karana-s. But there are only eleven. There are four fixed karana-s and seven repeating karana-s. The four fixed karana-s are:
# Kimstughna
# Shakuni
# Chatushpd
# Ngava
The seven repeating karana-s are:
# Bava
# Blava
# Kaulava
# Taitula
# Garaj
# Vanij
# Vishti Bhadr
 Now the first half of the first tithi of the bright fortnight is always Kimstughna karana. Hence this karana is fixed.
 Next, the seven repeating karana-s repeat eight times to cover the next 56 half-tithi-s. Thus these are the repeating karana-s.
 The three remaining half-tithi-s take the remaining fixed karana-s in order. Thus these are also fixed.
 Thus one gets sixty karana-s from eleven.
The karana active during sunrise of a day is the karana for the day.

Months of the lunisolar calendar
When a new moon occurs before sunrise on a day, that day is said to be the first day of the lunar month. So it is evident that the end of the lunar month will coincide with a new moon. A lunar month has 29 or 30 days according to the movement of the moon.
The tithi at sunrise of a day is the only label of the day. There is no running day number from the first day to the last day of the month. This has some unique results, as explained below:
Sometimes two successive days have the same tithi. In such a case, the latter is called an adhika tithi where adhika means extra. Sometimes, one tithi may never touch a sunrise, and hence no day will be labeled by that tithi. It is then said to be a tithi kshaya where kshaya means loss.
Naming lunar months
There are twelve lunar month names:
# Chaitra
# Vaishkh
# Jyaishtha
# shdha
# Shrvana
# Bhdrapad
# shwin
# Krtik
# Mrgashrsha
# Paush
# Mgh
# Phlgun
Determining which name a lunar month takes is somewhat indirect. It is based on the rshi into which the sun transits within a lunar month, i.e. before the new moon ending the month.
There are twelve rshi names, there are twelve lunar month names. When the sun transits into the Mesha rshi in a lunar month, then the name of the lunar month is Chaitra. When the sun transits into Vrishabha, then the lunar month is Vaishkh. So on.
The Sanskrit grammatical derivation of the lunar month names Chaitra etc is: the lunar month which has its central full moon occurring at or near the nakshatra Chitr is called Chaitra. Similarly, for the nakshatra-s Vishkh, Jyeshth, Prva Ashdh, Shravan, Bhdrapad, Ashvin old name Ashvayuj, Krittik, Mrigashrsha, Pushya, Megh and Prva/Uttara Phalgun the names Vaishkh etc are derived.
The lunar months are split into two pakshas of 15 days. 
The waxing paksha is called shuklapaksha, light half, and the waning paksha the krishnapaksha, dark half. There are two different systems for making the lunar calendar: 
amanta or mukhya mana system - a month begins with a new moon, mostly followed in the southern states
purnimanta or gauna mana system - a month begins with a full moon, followed more in the North. 
=Extra months=
When the sun does not at all transit into any rshi but simply keeps moving within a rshi in a lunar month i.e. before a new moon, then that lunar month will be named according to the first upcoming transit. It will also take the epithet of adhik or extra. For example, if a lunar month elapsed without a solar transit and the next transit is into Mesha, then this month without transit is labeled adhik Chaitra. The next month will be labeled according to its transit as usual and will get the epithet nija original or shuddha clean. Note that an adhik msa month is the first of two whereas an adhika tithi is the second of two.
An adhik msa occurs once every two or three years meaning, with a gap of one or two years without adhik msa-s. Extra Month, or adhik mas msa mas = lunar month or  purushottam mas It is known so to give it a religious name, purushottam = krishna falls every 32.5 months. Thus 12 Hindu mas msa is equal to approximate 356 days, while solar year have 365 or 366 in leap year which create differece of 9 to 10 days, which is subset every 3rd year. But no adhik mas falls during Kartik to Maha.  User:Sapovadia Sapovadia 16:06, 15 November 2007 UTC
=Lost months=
If the sun transits into two rshi-s within a lunar month, then the month will have to be labeled by both transits and will take the epithet kshay or loss. There is considered to be a loss because: if the sun had transited into only one raashi in a lunar month as is usual, there would have been two separate months labeled by the two transits in question; but now there is only one month labeled by both transits! 
For example, if the sun transits into Mesh and Vrishabh in a lunar month, then it will be called Chaitra-Vaishaakh kshaya. There will be no separate months labeled Chaitra and Vaishkh.
A kshay msa occurs very rarely. Known gaps between occurrence of kshaya msa-s are 19 and 141 years. The last was in 1983. Jan-15 through Feb-12 were Pausha-Mgha kshay. Feb-13 onwards was adhik Phlguna.
Special Case:
If there is no solar transit in one lunar month but there are two transits in the next lunar month,
 the first month will be labeled by the first transit of the second month as usual and take the epithet adhik and 
 the next month will be labeled by both its transits as is usual for a kshay msa.
This is a very very rare occurrence. The last was in 1315. Oct-08 to Nov-05 were adhik Krtik. Nov-06 to Dec-05 were Krtik-Mrgashrsh kshaya. Dec-06 onwards was Paush.
Religious observances in case of extra and lost months
Among normal months, adhika months, and kshaya months, the earlier are considered better for religious purposes. That means, if a festival should fall on the 10th tithi of the shvayuja month this is called Vijayadashami Vijayadasham and there are two shvayuja months caused by the existence of an adhika shvayuja, the first adhika month will not see the festival, and the festival will be observed only in the second nija month. However, if the second month is shvayuja kshaya then the festival will be observed in the first adhika month itself.
When two months are rolled into one in the case of a kshaya msa, the festivals of both months will also be rolled into this kshaya msa. For example, the festival of Maha Shivaratri Mahshivartri which is to be observed on the fourteenth tithi of the Mgha krishna paksha was, in 1983, observed on the corresponding tithi of Pausha-Mgha kshaya krishna paksha, since in that year, Pausha and Mgha were rolled into one, as mentioned above.
Year of the lunisolar calendar
The new year day is the first day of the shukla paksha of Chaitra. In the case of adhika or kshaya months relating to Chaitra, the aforementioned religious rules apply giving rise to the following results:
 If an adhika Chaitra is followed by a nija Chaitra, the new year starts with the nija Chaitra.
 If an adhika Chaitra is followed by a Chaitra-Vaishkha kshaya, the new year starts with the adhika Chaitra.
 If a Chaitra-Vaishkha kshaya occurs with no adhika Chaitra before it, then it starts the new year.
 If a Phlguna-Chaitra kshaya occurs, it starts the new year.
Another kind of lunisolar calendar
There is another kind of lunisolar calendar which differs from the former in the way the months are named. This section describes the differences involved, and may be skipped if the article is already too complicated for the reader. It is only included for completeness.
When a full moon instead of new moon occurs before sunrise on a day, that day is said to be the first day of the lunar month. In this case, the end of the lunar month will coincide with a full moon. This is called the prnimnta mna or full-moon-ending reckoning, as against the amnta mna or new-moon-ending reckoning used before.
This definition leads to a lot of complications:
 The first paksha of the month will be krishna and the second will be shukla.
 The new year is still on the first day of the Chaitra shukla paksha. The next paksha-s will be the Vaishkha krishna, Vaishkha shukla, Jyaishtha krishna and so on, till Phlguna krishna, Phlguna shukla and Chaitra krishna, which is now the last paksha of the year.
 The shukla paksha of a given month, say Chaitra, comprises the same actual days in both systems, as can be deduces from a careful analysis of the rules. However, the Chaitra krishna paksha-s defined by the two systems will be on different days, since the Chaitra krishna paksha precedes the Chaitra shukla paksha is the prnimnta system but follows it in the amnta system.
 Though the regular months are defined by the full moon, the adhika and kshaya lunar months are still defined by the new moon. That is, even if the prnimnta system is followed, adhika or kshaya months will start with the first sunrise after the new moon, and end with the new moon.
 The adhika month will therefore get sandwiched between the two paksha-s of the nija months. For example, a Shrvana adhika msa will be inserted as follows: 
# nija Shrvana krishna paksha
# adhika Shrvana shukla paksha
# adhika Shrvana krishna paksha and 
# nija Shrvana shukla pakshaafter which Bhdrapada krishna paksha will come as usual. 
 If there is an adhika Chaitra, then it will follow the nija Chaitra krishna paksha at the end of the year. Only with the nija Chaitra shukla paksha will the new year start. The only exception is when it is followed by a kshaya, and that will be mentioned later.
 The kshaya month is more complicated. If in the amnta system there is a Pausha-Mgha kshaya, then in the prnimnta system there will be the following paksha-s:
# Pausha krishna paksha
# Pausha-Maagha kshaya shukla paksha
# Maagha-Phaalguna kshaya krishna paksha and a 
# Phlguna shukla paksha.
 The special kshaya case where an adhika msa precedes a kshaya msa gets even more convoluted. First, we should remember that the shvayuja shukla paksha is the same in both the systems. After this come the following paksha-s:
# nija Krtika krishna paksha
# adhika Krtika shukla paksha
# adhika Krtika krishna paksha
# Krtika-Mgashrsha kshaya shukla paksha
# Mgashrsha-Pausha kshaya krishna paksha 
# Pausha shukla pakshafollowed by the Mgha krishna paksha etc as usual.
 The considerations for the new year are:
# If there is a Chaitra-Vaishkha kshaya shukla paksha:
## if an adhika Chaitra precedes it, then the adhika Chaitra shukla paksha starts the new year
## if not, the kshaya shukla paksha starts the new year
# If there is a Phlguna-Chaitra kshaya shukla paksha then it starts the new year
It must be noted, however, that none of these above complications cause a change in the day of religious observances. Since only the name of the krishna paksha-s of the months will change in the two systems, festivals which fall on the krishna paksha will be defined by the appropriate changed name. That is, the Maha Shivaratri Mahshivartri, defined in the amnta mna to be observed on the fourteenth of the Mgha krishna paksha will now in the prnimnta mna be defined by the Phlguna krishna paksha.
Correspondence of the lunisolar calendar to the solar calendar
A lunisolar calendar is always a calendar based on the moon's celestial motion, which in a way keeps itself close to a solar calendar based on the sun's apparent celestial motion. That is, the lunisolar calendar's new year is to kept always close within certain limits to a solar calendar's new year. 
Since the Hindu lunar month names are based on solar transits, and the month of Chaitra will, as defined above, always be close to the solar month of Mesha, the Hindu lunisolar calendar will always keep in track with the Hindu solar calendar.
The Hindu solar calendar by contrast starts on April 14-15 each year. This signifies the sun's entry into Mesha rasi and is celebrated as the New Year in Assam, Bengal, Orissa, Manipur, Nepal, Kerala, Punjab, TamilNadu and Tripura. The first month of the year is called Chitterai in Tamil, Medam in Malayalam and Baisakh in Bengali/Punjabi. This solar new year is now celebrated on the same day in Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand due to Hindu influence on those countries.
Year numbering
The epoch starting point or first day of the zeroth year of the current era of Hindu calendar both solar and lunisolar is February 18 4th millennium BCE 3102 BCE in  the proleptic Julian calendar or January 23 4th millennium BCE 3102 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. Both the solar and lunisolar calendars started on this date. After that, each year is labeled by the number of years elapsed since the epoch.
This is a unique feature of the Hindu calendar. All other systems use the current ordinal number of the year as the year label. But just as a person's true age is measured by the number of years that have elapsed starting from the date of the person's birth, the Hindu calendar measures the number of years elapsed. As of 2005 As of May 18, 2005, 5106 years had elapsed in the Hindu calendar, so this is the 5109th Hindu calendar year. Note that the lunisolar calendar year will usually start earlier than the solar calendar year.
Other systems of numbering the Hindu years can be read about at the Samvat article.
Year names
Apart from the numbering system outlined above, there is also a cycle of 60 calendar year names, called Samvatsaras, which started at the first year at elapsed years zero and runs continuously:

Eras
Hinduism has of four eras or ages, of which we are currently in the last. The four are:
# Krita Yuga or Satya Yuga
# Treta Yuga Tret Yuga
# Dvapara Yuga Dvpara Yuga
# Kali Yuga
They are often translated into English as the golden, silver, bronze and Iron Ages. Yuga means era or age. The ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span and emotional and physical strength. The epoch provided above is the start of the Kali Yuga. The Kali Yuga is 432,000 years long. The Dvpara, Tret  and Krita Satya Yuga-s are two, three and four times the length of the Kali Yuga respectively. Thus they together constitute 4,320,000 years. This is called a Chaturyuga.
A thousand and a thousand i.e. two thousand chaturyuga-s are said to be one day and night of the creator Brahma Brahm. He the creator lives for 100 years of 360 such days and at the end, he is said to dissolve, along with his entire Creation, into the Eternal Soul or Hindu philosophy Paramtman.
A different view of the timespan of a yuga is given by Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, the guru of Paramahansa Yogananda. This is detailed in his book, The Holy Science. According to this view, one complete yuga cycle is equal to one complete precession of the equinox, a period of aprroximately 24,000 years. The ascending phase consists of a 1200 year Kali, 2400 year Dwapara, 3600 year Treta and 4800 year Krita Satya yuga. The descending phase reverses this order, thus both ascending and descending phases equal 24,000 years. According to calculations given in the book, the most recent yuga change was in 1699, when the Earth passed from Kali Yuga the lowest material age to Dvpara Yuga the second age associated with electrical, atomic and finer forces. We are in an ascending spiral right now, and will pass into the Tret Yuga in 4100 AD. According to the book, the motion of the stars moving across the sky a.k.a.precession is the observable of the Sun's motion around another star. The quality of human intellect depends on the distance of the Sun and Earth from a certain point in space known as the Grand Center, Magnetic Center or Vishnunabi Vishnu. The closer the Sun is to it, the more subtle energy the Solar System receives, and the greater is the level of human spiritual and overall development. As the Sun moves around its companion star, it brings us closer to or drives us farther away from Vishnunabi, resulting in the rising and falling ages here on Earth.
Yukteswar tells us that the calendars of the higher ages were based on the Yugas, with each era named after its Yuga. Hence, the year 3000 BC/BCE was known as descending Dwapara 102 because the last descending Dwapara yuga began 102 years earlier in 3102 BC/BCE. He stated that this method was used up until the recent Dark Ages, when knowledge of the connection with the yugas and the precession cycle was lost; The mistake crept into the almanacs for the first time during the reign of Raja Parikshit, just after the completion of the last descending Dwapara Yuga. At that time Maharaja Yudhisthira, noticing the appearance of the dark Kali Yuga, made over his throne to his grandson, the said Raja Parikshit. Maharaja Yudhisthira, together with all the wise men of his court, retired to the Himalaya Mountains... thus there was no one who could understand the principle of correctly calculating the ages of the several Yugas. Consequently, when the Dwapara was over and the Kali era began no one knew enough to restart the calendar count. They knew they were in a Kali Yuga which is why the old Hindu calendar now begins with K.Y. but the beginning of this calendar which in 2006 stands at 5108 can still be traced to 3102 BC/BCE, 3102+2006=5108 the start of the last descending Dwapara Yuga. To this day there is still much confusion why the Kali starts at this date or what the correct length of the Yugas should be. Yukteswar suggests that a return to basing the Yuga calendar on the motion of the equinox would be a positive step.
History
The Hindu Calendar descends from the Vedic times. There are many references to calendrics in the Vedas. The Vednga adjunct to Veda called Jyautisha literally, celestial body study prescribed all the aspects of the Hindu calendars. After the Vedic period, there were many scholars such as Aryabhata ryabhata 5th century CE, Varahamihira Varhamihira 6th century and Bhskara 12th century who were experts in Jyautisha and contributed to the development of the Hindu Calendar.
The most widely used authoritative text for the Hindu Calendars in the Srya Siddhnta, a text of uncertain age, though some place it at 10th century.
The traditional Vedic calendar used to start with the month of agrahayan agra=first + ayan = travel of the sun, equinox or Mrgashirsha.  This is the month where the Sun crosses the equator, i.e. the vernal equinox.  This month was called mrgashirsha after the fifth nakshatra around lambda orionis.  Due to the precession of the earth's axis, the vernal equinox is now in Pisces, and corresponds to the month of chaitra.  This shift over the years is what has led to various calendar reforms in different regions to assert different months as the start month for the year.  Thus, some calendars e.g. Vikram start with Chaitra, which is the present-day month of the vernal equinox, as the first month.  Others may start with Vaisakha e.g. Bangla Calendar Bangabda.  The shift in the vernal equinox by nearly four months from agrahaayana to chaitra in sidereal terms seems to indicate that the original naming conventions may date to the fourth or fifth millennium BCE, since the period of precession in the earth's axis is about 25,800 years.
Regional variants
The Indian Calendar Reform Committee, appointed in 1952 shortly after Indian independence, identified more than thirty well-developed calendars, all variants of the Surya Siddhanta calendar outlined here, in systematic use across different parts of India. These include the widespread Vikrama and Shalivahana calendars and regional variations thereof. The Tamil calendar, a solar calendar, is used in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
Vikrama and Shalivahana calendars
The two calendars most widely used in India today are the Vikrama calendar followed in Western and Northern India and Nepal, and the Shalivahana calendar Shalivahana or Saka calendar which is followed in  South India and Maharashtra.
Both the Vikrama and the Shalivahana eras are lunisolar calendars, and feature annual cycles of twelve lunar months, each month divided into two phases: the 'bright half' shukla and the 'dark half' bahula; these correspond respectively to the periods of the 'waxing' and the 'waning' of the moon. Thus, the period beginning from the first day after the new moon and ending on the full moon day constitutes the shukla paksha or 'bright half' of the month; the period beginning from the day after the full moon until and including the next new moon day constitutes the bahula paksha or 'dark half' of the month.
The names of the 12 months, as also their sequence, are the same in both calendars; however, the new year is celebrated at separate points during the year and the year zero for the two calendars is different. In the Vikrama calendar, the zero year corresponds to 58 BCE, while in the Shalivahana calendar, it corresponds to 78 CE. The Vikrama calendar begins with the month of Baishakh April. The Shalivahana calendar begins with the month of Chaitra March and the Ugadi/Gudi Padwa festivals mark the new year. 
Another little-known difference between the two calendars exists: while each month in the Shalivahana calendar begins with the 'bright half' and is followed by the 'dark half', the opposite obtains in the Vikrama calendar. Thus, each month of the Shalivahana calendar ends with the no-moon day and the new month begins on the day after that, while the full-moon day brings each month of the Vikrama calendar to a close.
National calendars in South and South East Asia
A variant of the Shalivahana Calendar was reformed and standardized as the Indian National calendar in 1957. This official calendar follows the Shalivahana calendar in beginning from the month of Chaitra and counting years with 78 CE being 0 year year zero. It features a constant number of days in every month with leap years. 
The Bengali Calendar, or Bangla calendar introduced 1584, is widely used in eastern India in the state of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam. A reformation of this calendar was introduced in present-day Bangladesh in 1966, with constant days in each month and a leap year system; this serves as the national calendar for Bangladesh. Nepal follows the Nepali calendar Bikram Sambat. Parallel months and roughly the same periods apply to a number of Hindu-influenced calendars in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Correspondence between calendars
As an indicator of this variation, Whitaker's Almanac reports that the Gregorian year 2000 AD/CE corresponds, respectively with:
#Year 5101 in the Kaliyuga calendar;
#Year 2544 in the Buddha Nirvana calendar;
#Year 2057 in the nepali calendar  Bikram Samvat  calendar;
#Year 1922 in the Saka calendar;
#Year 1921 shown in terms of 5-yearly cycles of the Vedanga Jyotisa calendar;
#Year 1407 in the Bengali calendar;
#Year 1176 in the Kolla Varsham calendar.
