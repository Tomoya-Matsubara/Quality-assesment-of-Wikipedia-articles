Fun Home (subtitled A Family Tragicomic) is a graphic memoir by Alison Bechdel, author of the comic strip Dykes to Watch out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, focusing on her complex relationship with her father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide and the role of literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.1234
Fun Home was both a popular and critical success, and spent two weeks on the New York Times' bestseller list.56 In the New York Times Sunday Book Review, Sean Wilsey called it &quot;a pioneering work, pushing two genres (comics and memoir) in multiple new directions.&quot;7 Several publications named Fun Home as one of the best books of 2006; it was also nominated for several awards, including the National Book Critics Circle Award and three Eisner Awards (one of which it won).89 A French translation of Fun Home was serialized in the newspaper Lib&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration; the book was an official selection of the Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me International Comics Festival and has been the subject of an academic conference in France.101112
Fun Home also generated controversy: a public library in Missouri removed Fun Home from its shelves for five months after local residents objected to its contents.1314
Plot and thematic summary
 The narrative of Fun Home is non-linear and recursive.15 Incidents are told and re-told in the light of new information or themes.16 In an essay on memoirs and truth in the academic journal PMLA, Nancy K. Miller explains that as Bechdel revisits scenes and themes &quot;she re-creates memories in which the force of attachment generates the structure of the memoir itself.&quot;17 Additionally, the memoir derives its structure from allusions to various works of literature, Greek myth and visual arts; the events of Bechdel's family life during her childhood and adolescence are presented through this allusive lens.18 Miller notes that the narratives of the referenced literary texts &quot;provide clues, both true and false, to the mysteries of family relations.&quot;19
The memoir centers on her family but gives particular attention to Alison Bechdel's relationship with her father, Bruce. Bruce Bechdel was a funeral director and high school English teacher in Beech Creek, where Alison Bechdel and her siblings grew up. The book's title comes from the family nickname for the funeral home, the family business in which Bruce Bechdel grew up and later worked.20 His two occupations are reflected in Fun Home's focus on death and literature.21
On one level, the memoir traces Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home.22 His concentrated pursuit of this long-term aesthetic quest is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of rage.2324 This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his closeted homosexual tendencies.25 Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters.26 At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed.27 Although the evidence is equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.282930
The story also deals with Alison Bechdel's own struggle with her sexual identity, culminating in the realization that she is a lesbian and her coming out to her parents.3132 The memoir frankly examines her sexual development, including transcripts from her childhood diary, anecdotes about masturbation, and tales of her first sexual experiences.33 In addition to their common homosexuality, Alison and Bruce Bechdel share obsessive-compulsive tendencies and artistic leanings, albeit with opposing aesthetic senses: &quot;I was Spartan to my father's Athenian. Modern to his Victorian. Butch to his nelly. Utilitarian to his aesthete.&quot;34 This opposition was a source of tension in their relationship, as both tried to express their dissatisfaction with their given gender roles: &quot;Not only were we inverts, were were inversions of each other. While I was trying to compensate for something unmanly in him, he was attempting to express something feminine through me. It was a war of cross-purposes, and so doomed to perpetual escalation.&quot;35 However, shortly before Bruce Bechdel's death he and his daughter have a conversation which is presented as a partial resolution to this conflict.36
At several points in the book, Bechdel questions whether her decision to come out as a lesbian was one of the triggers for her father's suicide.3738 This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.394041
Allusions
The allusive references used in Fun Home are not merely structural or stylistic: Bechdel writes, &quot;I employ these allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms. And perhaps my cool aesthetic distance itself does more to convey the arctic climate of our family than any particular literary comparison.&quot;42 Bechdel, as the narrator, considers her relationship to her father through the myth of Daedalus and Icarus.43 As a child, she confused her family and their Gothic Revival home with the Addams Family seen in the cartoons of Charles Addams.44 Bruce Bechdel's suicide is discussed with reference to Albert Camus' novel A Happy Death and essay The Myth of Sisyphus.45 His careful construction of an aesthetic and intellectual world is compared to The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the narrator suggests that Bruce Bechdel modeled elements of his life after Fitzgerald's, as portrayed in the biography The Far Side of Paradise.46 His wife Helen is compared with the protagonists of the Henry James novels Washington Square and The Portrait of a Lady.47 Helen Bechdel was an amateur actress, and plays in which she acted are also used to illuminate aspects of her marriage. She met Bruce Bechdel when the two were appearing in a college production of The Taming of the Shrew, and Alison Bechdel intimates that this was &quot;a harbinger of my parents' later marriage&quot;.48 Helen Bechdel's role as Lady Bracknell in a local production of The Importance of Being Earnest is shown in some detail; Bruce Bechdel is compared with Oscar Wilde.49 His homosexuality is also examined with allusion to Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time.50 The father and daughter's artistic and obsessive-compulsive tendencies are discussed with reference to E. H. Shepard's illustrations for The Wind in the Willows.51 Bruce and Alison Bechdel exchange hints about their sexualities by exchanging memoirs: the father gives the daughter Earthly Paradise, an autobiographical collection of the writings of Colette; shortly afterwards, in what Alison Bechdel describes as &quot;an eloquent unconscious gesture&quot;, she leaves a library copy of Kate Millett's memoir Flying for him.52 Finally, returning to the Daedalus myth, Alison Bechdel casts herself as Stephen Dedalus and her father as Leopold Bloom in James Joyce's Ulysses, with parallel references to the myth of Telemachus and Odysseus.53
In addition to the literary allusions which are explicitly acknowledged in the text, Bechdel incorporates visual allusions to television programs and other items of pop culture into her artwork, often as images on a television in the background of a panel.54 These visual references include the film It's a Wonderful Life, Bert and Ernie of Sesame Street, Yogi Bear, Batman, the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, the resignation of Richard Nixon and The Flying Nun.5556
Artwork
Fun Home is drawn in black line art with a gray-green ink wash.57 Sean Wilsey wrote that Fun Home's panels &quot;combine the detail and technical proficiency of R. Crumb with a seriousness, emotional complexity and innovation completely its own.&quot;58 Writing in the Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide, Diane Ellen Hamer contrasted &quot;Bechdel's habit of drawing her characters very simply and yet distinctly&quot; with &quot;the attention to detail that she devotes to the background, those TV shows and posters on the wall, not to mention the intricacies of the funeral home as a recurring backdrop.&quot;59 Bechdel told an interviewer for The Comics Journal that the richness of each panel of Fun Home was very deliberate:
 Bechdel wrote and illustrated Fun Home over the course of seven years.60 Her laborious artistic process made the process of illustration slow. She began each page by creating a framework in Adobe Illustrator, on which she placed the text and drew rough figures.6162 She used extensive photo reference and, for many panels, posed for each human figure herself, using a digital camera to record her poses.63646566 Bechdel also used photo reference for background elements. For example, to illustrate a panel depicting fireworks seen from a Greenwich Village rooftop on July 4, 1976, she used Google Images to find a photograph of the New York skyline taken from that particular building in that period.676869 She also painstakingly copied by hand many family photographs, letters, local maps and excerpts from her own childhood journal, incorporating these images into her narrative.70 After using the reference material to draw a tight framework for the page, Bechdel copied the line art illustration onto plate finish Bristol board for the final inked page, which she then scanned into her computer.7172 The gray-green ink wash for each page was drawn on a separate page of watercolor paper, and combined with the inked image using Photoshop.737475 Bechdel chose the greenish wash color for its flexibility, and because it had &quot;a bleak, elegaic quality&quot; which suited the subject matter.76 Bechdel attributes this detailed creative process to her &quot;barely controlled obsessive-compulsive disorder&quot;.7778
Publication and reception
Fun Home was first printed in hardcover by Houghton Mifflin (Boston, New York) on June 8, 2006.79 This edition appeared on the New York Times' Hardcover Nonfiction bestseller list for two weeks, covering the period from June 18&lt;U+2013&gt;July 1, 2006.8081 It continued to sell well, and by February 2007 there were 55,000 copies in print.82 A trade paperback edition was published in the United Kingdom by Random House under the Jonathan Cape imprint on September 14, 2006; Houghton Mifflin published a paperback edition under the Mariner Books imprint on June 5, 2007.8384
 In the summer of 2006, a French translation of Fun Home was serialized in the Paris newspaper Lib&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration (which had previously serialized Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi).85 This translation, by Corinne Julve and Lili Sztajn, was subsequently published by &lt;U+00C9&gt;ditions Deno&lt;U+00EB&gt;l on October 26, 2006.86 In January 2007, Fun Home was an official selection of the Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me International Comics Festival.87 In the same month, the Anglophone Studies department of the Universit&lt;U+00E9&gt; Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Rabelais, Tours sponsored an academic conference on Bechdel's work, with presentations in Paris and Tours.88 At this conference, papers were presented examining Fun Home from several perspectives: as containing &quot;trajectories&quot; filled with paradoxical tension; as a text interacting with images as a paratext; and as a search for meaning using drag as a metaphor.899091 These papers and others on Bechdel and her work were later published in the peer-reviewed journal GRAAT (Groupe de Recherches Anglo-Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;ricaines de Tours, or Tours Anglo-American Research Group).9293
In October 2006, a resident of Marshall, Missouri attempted to have Fun Home and Craig Thompson's Blankets, both graphic novels, removed from the city's public library.94 Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as &quot;pornography&quot; and expressed concern that they would be read by children.9596 Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in &quot;reputable, professional book review journals,&quot; and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards &quot;the slippery slope of censorship&quot;.9798 On October 11, 2006, the library's board appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed Fun Home and Blankets from circulation until the new policy was approved.99100 The committee &quot;decided not to assign a prejudicial label or segregate [the books] by a prejudicial system&quot;, and presented a materials selection policy to the board.101102 On March 14, 2007, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees voted to return both Fun Home and Blankets to the library's shelves.103 Bechdel described the attempted banning as &quot;a great honor&quot;, and described the incident as &quot;part of the whole evolution of the graphic-novel form.&quot;104
Reviews and awards
Fun Home was positively reviewed in many publications. The Times of London described Fun Home as &quot;a profound and important book;&quot; Salon.com called it &quot;a beautiful, assured piece of work;&quot; and the New York Times ran two separate reviews and a feature on the memoir.105106107108109 In one New York Times review, Sean Wilsey called Fun Home &quot;a pioneering work, pushing two genres (comics and memoir) in multiple new directions&quot; and &quot;a comic book for lovers of words&quot;.110 Jill Soloway, writing in the Los Angeles Times, praised the work overall but commented that Bechdel's reference-heavy prose is at times &quot;a little opaque&quot;.111 Similarly, a reviewer in The Tyee felt that &quot;the narrator's insistence on linking her story to those of various Greek myths, American novels and classic plays&quot; was &quot;forced&quot; and &quot;heavy-handed&quot;.112 By contrast, the Seattle Times' reviewer wrote positively of the book's use of literary reference, calling it &quot;staggeringly literate&quot;.113 The Village Voice said that Fun Home &quot;shows how powerfully&lt;U+2014&gt;and economically&lt;U+2014&gt;the medium can portray autobiographical narrative. With two-part visual and verbal narration that isn't simply synchronous, comics presents a distinctive narrative idiom in which a wealth of information may be expressed in a highly condensed fashion.&quot;114
 Several publications listed Fun Home as one of the best books of 2006, including the New York Times, Amazon.com, The Times of London, New York magazine and Publishers Weekly, which ranked it as the best comic book of 2006. 115116117118119120 Salon.com named Fun Home the best nonfiction debut of 2006, admitting that they were fudging the definition of &quot;debut&quot; and saying, &quot;Fun Home shimmers with regret, compassion, annoyance, frustration, pity and love&lt;U+2014&gt;usually all at the same time and never without a pervasive, deeply literary irony about the near-impossible task of staying true to yourself, and to the people who made you who you are.&quot;121 Entertainment Weekly called it the best nonfiction book of the year, and Time named Fun Home the best book of 2006, describing it as &quot;the unlikeliest literary success of 2006&quot; and &quot;a masterpiece about two people who live in the same house but different worlds, and their mysterious debts to each other.&quot; 122123
Fun Home was a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award, in the memoir/autobiography category, and was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book. 124125126 In 2007, Fun Home won the Stonewall Book Award for non-fiction, the Publishing Triangle-Judy Grahn Nonfiction Award, and the Lambda Literary Award in the &quot;Lesbian Memoir and Biography&quot; category.127128129 Fun Home was nominated for the 2007 Eisner Awards in two categories, Best Reality-Based Work and Best Graphic Album, and Bechdel was nominated as Best Writer/Artist.130 Fun Home won the Eisner for Best Reality-Based Work.131
