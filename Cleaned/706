Artwork
Olsen&lt;U+2019&gt;s artwork uses abstracted geographical forms and memory from the places he knew best, including Merthyr Tydfil, the Cotswolds, Rome, Florence and Miami.161718 Together with painting, during his later life in Miami, he also worked on producing books in collaboration with the writer Jerome Fletcher19 using both hyper-text and conventional narratives.20
Poet, art historian and critic Tony Curtis described his collaborative artist book with the bookbinder David Sellars, as &quot;one of the outstanding artists' books of recent years&quot;. The book combined images of Florence alongside those of Merthyr Tydfil, using laser prints, screen-printing and acrylic paint on Kh&lt;U+0101&gt;d&lt;U+012B&gt; paper.21
His work is held in a number of collections including Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum, University of Southampton and Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.22
