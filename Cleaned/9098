Joyce Green Hospital was a hospital near Dartford in Kent, England.
The hospital was planned in the late 19th century to accommodate sufferers of smallpox, which had reached epidemic levels in London. It replaced a number of hospital boats based in Long Reach along the River Thames. It was built on the former Joyce Green estate, whose area totalled 218 acres. The building of the hospital was delayed due to disagreements with the Local Government Board over the proposed size. It opened in 1903 with a capacity of 986 beds. The threat of smallpox had subsided by 1910.
In the 1950s, the hospital became used as a training ground for fever nurses, due to the existing facilities for treating infectious diseases.
The hospital eventually closed and was demolished in 2000.
