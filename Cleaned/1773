Early life
Jay Chou grew up in the small town of Linkou Township Linkou, Taiwan. Both his parents were secondary school teachers: his mother Ye Hui Mei zh-tsp t= s= p=Y Humi taught fine arts while his father Zhou Yao Zhong zh-cp c= p=Zhu Yozhng was a biology instructor. His mother noticed his sensitivity to music and took him to piano lessons at the age of 4. During his childhood, he was fascinated with capturing sounds and songs with his tape recorder, something he carried everywhere with him. In the third grade, he became interested in music theory and also started cello lessons. As an only child, he enjoyed being the family's center of attention; he loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks.His parents divorced when he was 14; as a result, he became reclusive and introverted. Although he had friends, he often preferred to be alone listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At Dan Jiang Senior High School, he majored in piano and minored in cello. He showed talent for improvisation, became fond of pop music and began to write songs.zh icon cite book  last = Chou  first = Jay  title = Grandeur de D Major  format = Book  date = 2004-11-01  publisher = Hua Ren Ban Tu  location = China   isbn = 9572937146   pages = p.8, 12 
Chou graduated from high school with inadequate grades for university, so he prepared for military service, which was compulsory for all Taiwanese men at the age of 18. However, a sports injury triggered by an unexplainable and severe back pain eventually led to the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, a hereditary spine inflammation disease; as a result, he was exempted from conscription.zh icon cite news  url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2003-04-28/2225147402.html  title = Jay Chou discusses the wonder of life in illness     date = 2003-04-28   accessdate = 2007-06-02   publisher = sina.com.cn  format = News articlezh icon cite news  url = http://stars.zaobao.com/pages3/zhoujielun060225.html  title = Jacky Wu: Jay Chou takes 12 painkillers 12  publisher = zaobao.com  date = 2006-02-25   accessdate = 2007-06-02   format = News article  Meanwhile, he found himself a job as a waiter. Without his knowing, his friend had entered both their names in a talent show called Super New Talent King. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as lousy. Although they did not win, the show's host Jacky Wuan influential character in Taiwan's entertainment businesshappened to glance at Chou's music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist Vincent Fang zh-cp c= p=Fng Wnshn.
Over the next two years he wrote songs for Chinese pop artists, and also learned recording and sound mixing; his dedication was apparent as he even slept in the music studio. There were no plans to make him a singer because his mentor Wu thought he was too shy and not good-looking. Wu's music studio was later sold to Alfa Music, and the new manager Yang Jun Rong asked him to release his own album. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD Jay album Jay that was released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of R&B, hip hop music rap, classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly not only in Chinese-speaking regions, but in non-Chinese countries as well throughout Southeast Asia.zh icon cite web  url = http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/2007-01-08/23381402205.html  title = King of the new generation   date = 2007-01-08   accessdate = 2007-06-02   publisher =sina.com.cn   format = Web article Since 2000, Chou has released one album per year, each selling several million copies see Jay Chou#Discography Discography, and has been recognized with hundreds of awards.

He has held two world tours, The One 2002 and Incomparable 2004, performing in cities such as Taipei, Hong Kong, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Las Vegas, and Vancouver. Unlike most singers, Chou has an enormous amount of creative control over his music. He is not only the songwriter but also the producer in all of his albums; since 2005 he is also the music director and also directs his own music videos. 
While continuing to release an album yearly, he also entered the movie business with his debut role as the lead actor in Initial D film Initial D, for which he won Best Newcomer at the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Golden Horse Awards in 2005.cite news  url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/01/12/features/peepfri.php  title =  People: Jay Chou, Pete Doherty, Penlope Cruz   date = 2006-01-12   accessdate = 2007-06-02  publisher = International Herald Tribune  format = News article The following year, Chou was cast as a supporting character in the world-wide release of Curse of the Golden Flower, starring international Chinese stars Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li, giving Chou his brief but formal introduction to North American audiences.

Lyrics
Strictly speaking, Chou is more often a singer-composer than a lyricist. Several regulars write the lyrics for most of his music, but the content and style is unified with his own personality and image, covering a diverse range of topics and ideas. Vincent Fang accounts for more than half of the lyrics in his albums, helping to establish an important element in Chou's music: the use of meaningful, imagery- and emotionally-rich lyrics, sometimes written in the form of ancient Chinese poetry with reference to Chinese history or folklore.Ref_label C c none In addition to writing romantic hits,Ref_label D d none he also broaches on war, the Holy Bible Bible, sports, and martial arts.Ref_label E e none Vivian Hsu is a singer herself and has helped with Chou's earlier hits,Ref_label F f none while Huang Jun Lang zh-tsp t= s= p=Hung Jnlng is noted for his work surrounding unusual themes such as a detective story and chess game.Ref_label G g none Chou himself has written lyrics for many love ballads,Ref_label H h none but has also discussed societal ills such as drug addiction in Coward zh-cp c= p=nuf and loss of the rural countryside to urbanization in Terrace fields zh-cp c= p=ttin.

Book: Grandeur de D Major
Chou published his first book titled Grandeur de D Major zh-tsp t=D s=D p=D dio de hul on November 25, 2004.Ref_label K k none This 200-page book features a prologue written by his family, friends, and co-workers; the main section is a compilation of his personal attitudes, philosophies, and recollections of childhood experiences along with pictures from his music videos, many of which have never been released; and lastly, a list of the artist's major awards, musical and lyrical compositions, and discography. For the usually low-profile singer, this book revealed his personality and convictions that has served as the basis of his musical and public image. He demonstrated a strong appreciation of family values with an especially deep connection with his mother and maternal grandmother. His confidence and dedication towards music is evident as he dedicated 2 out of 7 chapters to music: the current state of the industry, his composition methodology, and the importance of individualism to his success in music. This pride is contrasted against his modesty and self-assessed naivety about many aspects in life, particularly regarding relationships and marriage.

Response to the news media and paparazzi
As with other stars, Chou has expressed a strong dislike of the paparazzi. In the early years of his career, unwanted attention by the media was usually dealt with by avoidance. In-line with his quiet nature, he frequently wore baseball caps and hoods while lowering his head and evading eye contact during interviews. In the recent years however, he has been less passive about the invasion of his privacy. To discourage the paparazzi from taking unsolicited pictures, Chou is known to photograph the paparazzi that follow him.zh icon cite news  url = http://www.singtao.com/index_archive.asp?d_str=20051223&htmlpage=main&news=1223fo01.html  title= Jay Chou and the paparazzi in a direct confrontation   publisher=Singtao Daily Hong Kong  date=2005-12-23   accessdate = 2007-06-02  He openly calls the paparazzi dogs and tabloids dog magazines, as shown in his lyrics for Besieged From All Sides zh-cp c= p=sminchg.

Fanbase
It is difficult to estimate the size and global spread of Chou's fanbase. The Chinese-speaking population of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China make up the majority of his fans. Despite rampant Copyright infringement piracy issues in this region, particularly in China, every album Chou has released so far has surpassed 2 million sales. According to Baidu, the most popular internet search engine in China, Chou is the number one searched male artist in 2003,zh icon http://top.baidu.com/ Baidu's Top Searches 2003 05,zh icon http://www.baidu.com/2005/ Baidu's Top Searches 2005 and 06.zh icon http://www.icif.china.cn/2006ndssfyb/ Baidu's Top Searches 2006 In Hong Kong, he has been the best-selling Mandarin artist for the past 4 years.zh icon cite web  title = Hong Kong Top Sales Music Awards presented  url=http://www.ifpihk.org/www/public/dcm/dis_dcmcontent.php?langsel=0&catid=3&rkey=gold   accessdate = 2007-06-02  According to a 2004 survey in five Chinese urban centers for children ages 9 to 14, 1 in 6 named Chou as their favorite idol; cite news  url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/09/content_363431.htm   title = Born in the 1990s   date = 2004-08-09   accessdate = 2007-06-02   publisher = China Daily   format = News article  he was also reported as the favorite singer of youths aged 8 to 25 in a study conducted in seven Asian countries 2006. cite web  url = http://www.synovate.com/current/news/extra/20061108/061108%20Young%20Asians%20Regional%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf   title = Synovate Young Asians survey reveals the hearts, minds, and wawllets of Asia's digital youth   date = 2006-11-08   accessdate = 2007-06-02   publisher = Synovate   format = Report PDF  He has a solid fanbase throughout Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. In Singapore, Chou was the second most searched celebrity behind Britney Spears in the Music category.Hitwise SingaporeTop 10 Industry Search TermsJanuary, 2007 
Currently, Chou remains largely unknown outside of Asia, except in cities with large Chinese immigrant populations such as Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Sydney, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. He has held concerts in major venues such as the MGM Grand Las VegasDecember 25, 2002, Shrine Auditorium Los AngelesDecember 18, 2004 cite news  last = Quah   first = Junie   url = http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=20302   title = Jay Chou in LA: An Incomparable Breakthrough   date = 2005-03-02   accessdate = 2007-06-02   publisher = UCLA Asia Institute   format = Review , and Galen Center Los AngelesDecember 24, 2007. His intention to increase his prominence in the Western world beyond Chinese audiences is clear. In 2006, Chou composed and sang the theme song for Fearless 2006 film Fearless, a movie released in major theatres in most English-speaking countries,cite news  url=http://english.sina.com/taiwan_hk/1/2006/0111/61386.html  title=Jay Chou pens theme song for new Jet Li movie 'Fearless'  publisher=Associated Press  date=2006-11-01   accessdate = 2007-06-02  though the impact to his fame has been minimal. His role in Curse of the Golden Flower limited release marks his acting debut in North America. Despite having a supporting but important role in the story's plot, the North American version of the official posters only featured a view of his back, greatly contrasting the Asian versions where his face and name were clear and placed between the leading actor and actress. Although Chou is still far from being well-known to English audiences, this movie has brought him international exposure.
