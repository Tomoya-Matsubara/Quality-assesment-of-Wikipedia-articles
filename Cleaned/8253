A Saudi candidate to become one of the September 11th hijackers, Khalid Saeed Ahmad al Zahrani was an al-Qaeda member, and has been imprisoned in the Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo Bay detainment camp since at least April 20, 2002 when his first interrogation is recorded.
According to the 9/11 Commission, he attended &quot;terrorist training camps&quot;, including Al Farouq in Afghanistan for eleven years. The 9/11 Commission reports:12
''&quot;Khalid Saeed Ahmad al Zahrani. He traveled to Afghanistan illegally after being prohibited by Saudi authorities from leaving Saudi Arabia. After being assigned to a mission in the U.S., he secretly reentered the Kingdom but failed in an attempt to have his name removed from the list of prohibited travelers so that he could obtain a U.S. visa. See Intelligence reports, interrogations of detainee, April 20, 2002; October 4, 2002; April 3, 2003.
He was sent, but failed, to convince Mushabib al-Hamlan not to abandon his training, after al-Hamlan left the training camp to remain with his ill mother.
He was later selected for an unknown mission in the United States, believed to have been the 9/11 hijackings, and re-entered Saudi Arabia to apply for a legitimate travel visa, but was denied an application because his name was on a Saudi watchlist of persons to be refused to travel outside the country.
In 2005, he partook in a hunger strike to protest the Qur'an desecration controversy1
