Rex Grossman (born August 23, 1980) is a quarterback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League. An Indiana native, Grossman graduated from Bloomington High School South and attended the University of Florida on an athletic scholarship.1 He led the Florida Gators to two championship games, and was the runner-up for the 2001 Heisman Trophy.2
Grossman began his professional career with the Chicago Bears as the twenty-second overall selection in the 2003 NFL Draft, but spent most of his first three seasons sidelined with injures.3 He completed his first full season in 2006, leading the Bears to a National Football Conference Championship, and helping the team score the second most points in the league.4
Early life
Rex Grossman was born in Bloomington, Indiana to Daniel and Maureen Grossman. Under the motivation and guidance of his father, Grossman began to play football at an early age in grade school. He originally started his football career as a running back. Despite his success as a running back, Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s mother asked his coach to convert him to a quarterback, while he was in the sixth grade.5
He attended Bloomington South High School, where he threw 97 touchdowns for 7,518 yards.6 Grossman threw 44 touchdown passes during his senior year, including a game where he threw six and two games where he threw four. His senior season reached its pinnacle on November 28, 1998, when he led his team to a 34-14 5A championship title over Homestead High School. Grossman threw five touchdowns for 216 yards, setting a state record for most touchdowns thrown in a championship game.7
Grossman received national recognition as the 1998 Indiana Player-of-the-Year by USA Today, and was ranked among the top fifteen players in the nation by the National Recruiting Advisor.8 Parade Magazine also named him to their &quot;All-America team&quot;.9 He received state-wide honors when he was named &quot;Indiana's Mr. Football&quot; later that year.10 Residents of his hometown community still remember his accomplishments and passing records. Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s high school retired his jersey in the summer of 2007 to commemorate his initial return and success during the 2006 season.11
Collegiate career
After completing high school, Grossman elected to attend the University of Florida as opposed to Indiana University, where his father and grandfather played football.12 After redshirting his freshman year, Grossman became Florida&lt;U+2019&gt;s third string quarterback, behind Jesse Palmer and Brock Berlin. Grossman struggled during his first game as the Gators' starting quarterback. After being called to fill in for the injured Palmer, Grossman threw three interceptions against the University of Georgia, prompting coach Steve Spurrier to bench him in favor of Berlin. Grossman rebounded during the following week by completing 21 of 34 passes for 334 yards and two touchdowns.13
Grossman continued his success by leading the Gators to a 10-2 season in 2001. He came in second to University of Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch in one of the closest votes in Heisman Trophy history, losing only by 62 votes.14The closest voting was in 1985, when Auburn University's Bo Jackson beat Chuck Long of Iowa by 16 points. He also earned accolades as the AP National Player-of-the-Year, and finalist for other awards, including the Walter Camp National Player-of-the-Year Award, Maxwell College Player-of-the-Year Award and Davey O'Brien National Quarterback-of-the-Year Award.1516 Grossman played in the famed &quot;Slingin' in the Rain&quot; game against Louisiana State University, where he threw 22 completions in 32 attempts, for 464 yards and 5 touchdowns, en route to a 44-15 victory over the Tigers. 1718 In 2006, in an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Grossman claimed the victory to be his most memorable game at the University of Florida.19 He ended his sophomore season with a 56-23 victory over the University of Maryland in the 2002 Orange Bowl.20
Grossman completed his junior year by leading the Gators to the 2003 Outback Bowl, where the University of Michigan defeated the team, 38-30. Nevertheless, he completed 21-of-41 passing for 323 yards and two touchdowns.21 Under the helm of Ron Zook, Steve Spurrier's successor, Grossman decided to forego his final year of collegiate eligibility and declared for the NFL draft. Grossman achieved many feats during his collegiate career, including either breaking or approaching many of the records set by Danny Wuerffel, and earned a 146.77 passer rating, becoming the third most efficient passer in the Southeastern Conference's history.22 He also threw 77 touchdowns for 9,164 yards.23
Professional career
Early setbacks
The Chicago Bears selected Grossman during the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft. Under the leadership of coach Dick Jauron, Grossman was sidelined in favor of veteran quarterbacks Chris Chandler and Kordell Stewart.24 Grossman only saw playing time during the later portion of the season after the Bears had been eliminated from playoff contention. His season ended when he was forced to leave the final game with a broken finger.25 Prior to the start of the 2004 NFL season, the Bears fired Jauron and hired Lovie Smith, who declared Grossman the team's starting quarterback. Grossman was criticized when he threw a game-ending interception against the Detroit Lions on opening day.26 Criticism of his durability intensified when he damaged his knee ligaments while scrambling for a touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings in the Metrodome. The injury forced Grossman to spend the remainder of the season recuperating.27
Grossman missed most of the 2005 NFL season after breaking his ankle in a pre-season game. Grossman appeared in a press conference after the game, where he remarked, &lt;U+201C&gt;Shit happens&lt;U+201D&gt; to a crowd of spectators.28 On December 18, 2005, Grossman returned to the field, leading the Bears to a 16-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. In the following game against the Green Bay Packers, he completed eleven of sixteen passes for 166 yards for a touchdown and one interception in a 24-17 victory. Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s victory enabled the Bears to clinch a playoff berth and the National Football Conference's second playoff seed.29 In his first playoff game, Grossman struggled to anchor the Bears&lt;U+2019&gt; offense, throwing 17 of 41 passes for 192 yards for one touchdown and an interception in a 29-21 loss against the Carolina Panthers.30
Return
During the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Grossman became the first Bears&lt;U+2019&gt; quarterback to start sixteen games since Erik Kramer in 1995.31 In a season dubbed as a &quot;roller coaster ride&quot; by Grossman himself, the fourth-year quarterback had several productive performances, which were seemingly diluted by a handful of turnover-ridden games.32 While earning a passer rating of at least 100 in seven games, he earned a sub 50 rating in five games during the latter portion of the season. Grossman, who was named as the &lt;U+201C&gt;NFC Offensive Player of the Month&lt;U+201D&gt; in September, concluded the season&lt;U+2019&gt;s final month with a 64.4 passer rating, including a zero rating during the season&lt;U+2019&gt;s finale game against the Green Bay Packers.3334 Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s work ethic drew criticism, when he admitted that he was not adequately prepared to play, and later claimed the game to be &quot;meaningless&quot;.35 After noticing that his words had been misinterpreted, he rationalized his statement days later.36 His inconsistent performance drew criticism, and calls for Lovie Smith to bench Grossman in favor of the newly acquired veteran Brian Griese.37
Nevertheless, Smith, who supported Grossman throughout the season, declared that Grossman would remain the Bears&lt;U+2019&gt; starting quarterback throughout the playoffs38, causing much skepticism within the Chicago area.39 He temporarily silenced his critics by leading the Bears to a 27-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks, completing 21 of 38 passes for 282 yards and one interception, fumble, and touchdown.40 The following week, he led the Bears to 39-14 victory over the New Orleans Saints, which allowed the Bears&lt;U+2019&gt; to claim the NFC Championship and advance to Super Bowl XLI.41 Grossman completed 20 of 28 passes, including a one-yard touchdown pass. However, he later threw two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown, and fumbled twice due twice due to miscues between him and center Olin Kreutz.42 Despite additional criticism from his detractors, Grossman received the Ed Block Courage Award after the season ended. The award is award to one player from every team, who possesses ideal characteristics of sportsmanship, spirituality, and professionalism, and is believed to be positive role models to their community.43
Playing style
Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s gunslinger attitude is illustrated in his desire to throw long passes, similar to his youth mentor, Brett Favre.4445 During the 2006 season, Grossman had an above average completion rate when throwing passes worth twenty or more yards, but struggled to complete shorter passes. This attitude attributed to Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s inconsistent play.46 During week twelve of the 2006 season, Grossman threw a game-ending interception while attempting a deep pass to Rashied Davis.47 However, during the Divisional Game of the 2006 Playoffs, he threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian on the opening play of the Bears&lt;U+2019&gt; second drive.48
Additionally, Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s ability to elude pursuers and scramble has significantly decreased since his season ending leg injury in 2004.49 Although he only played three games in 2004, Grossman amassed more rushing yards than he did in sixteen games in 2006.50 However, he showed his potential to scramble during a game against the St. Louis Rams, after he converted a third and long with a twenty-two yard run. Though the run was the longest of Grossman&lt;U+2019&gt;s career, it only gave him zero net yards for the season at that point.51
Personal life
Grossman's family has a rich football history. His father and grandfather were football players for Indiana University. His grandfather, Rex, also played for the Baltimore Colts during the 1940s.52 He resides in Bloomington, Indiana during the offseason with his wife Alison Miska, whom he has been married to since July 9, 2005.53 Grossman also has a sister and nephew who live in Lincolnwood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Also, his parents are friends with Archie Manning, an ex-New Orleans Saints quarterback and the father of Peyton and Eli Manning.54
Despite the bitter Bears-Packers Rivalry, Grossman has been a longtime admirer of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre and former Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh.55 Grossman was also an avid Indianapolis Colts and Indiana Pacers fan. Outside of football, he enjoys playing basketball and watching movies.56 Additionally, he is a regular guest on FOX News Chicago&lt;U+2019&gt;s The Final Word, a Sunday night sports show that is co-hosted by former Bears' wide receiver Tom Waddle. He also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated for Kids' February 2007 issue. The cover featured Grossman with teammates Devin Hester and Tommie Harris posing with Bears in a museum exhibit.
Grossman has also earned several nicknames over the course of his football career. While at the University of Florida, head coach Steve Spurrier dubbed him &lt;U+201C&gt;Sexy Rexy.&quot; The nickname earned national recognition when teammate Muhsin Muhammad used the nickname while introducing Grossman during a starting line-up segment on ESPN Monday Night Football.57 Grossman was also infamously known as &lt;U+201C&gt;Rex Glassman&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;Wrecks Grossman&lt;U+201D&gt; due to his injury-prone years.58
NFL career statistics
The following is a list of Grossman's statistics from his regular and post-season games. Grossman has occasionally put up notable statistics; among all quarterbacks during the 2006 NFL season, Grossman ranked tenth in number of pass attempts, seventh in touchdowns thrown, and third in interceptions.59 He completed his first full season with a relatively low 73.9 quarterback rating. His supporters have pointed out that this was better than quarterback ratings of Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, and Terry Bradshaw during their first full seasons;60 however, many quarterbacks with relatively undistinguished careers have performed similarly or better in their first years, including Grossman's backup Brian Griese.61 His twenty-three touchdowns in one season rank Grossman among the best Bears quarterbacks in the franchise&lt;U+2019&gt;s history.62 However, his twenty interceptions in one season are among the most thrown by any Bears&lt;U+2019&gt; quarterback in almost two decades.63 The unusual combination ranked Grossman as statistically the most inconsistent quarterback in almost a decade, just ahead of Ben Roethlisberger.64
