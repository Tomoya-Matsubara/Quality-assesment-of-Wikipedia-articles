ESPN Xtra is a satellite radio station that combines the existing audio simulcast of ESPNEWS programs with sports talk programming produced by ESPN, most notably three local programs produced by ESPN Radio owned-and-operated stations. This channel is on XM141.
The three shows added to the XM 141 lineup include The Michael Kay Show and The Max Kellerman Show both from WEPN, and Galloway and Company from KESN (on a 4 hour delay). Bill Simmons's The B.S. Report podcast from ESPN.com is also aired on the new channel1. In addition, the channel will air exclusive content to satellite radio throughout the year, and will include live events such as the ESPY Awards and the X Games.
XM announced the addition of this channel on 2008-01-28. Sirius announced changes to its audio simulcast of ESPNEWS, now called ESPN All Access, on 2007-12-11, but will not be adding any content announced for XM as it will be exclusive to XM.
