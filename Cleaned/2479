 No Name 1 is a census-designated place in Garfield County, Colorado. The population as of the 2010 Census was 123.2 It is located east of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, off exit 119 of Interstate 70 in Glenwood Canyon. It is named for No Name Creek and No Name Canyon. The No Name Tunnel of I-70 is nearby. The exit sign for No Name is visible in passing in the film Vanishing Point.
When the Interstate 70 in Colorado was being built, developers planned an exit at a then unnamed area. They decided to mark the exit sign &quot;No Name&quot; and, after the area was built up, the name stuck.3
