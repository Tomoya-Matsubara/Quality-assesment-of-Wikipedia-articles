Thriller is the sixth studio album by American pop musician Michael Jackson. The album was released on November 30, 1982 by Epic Records as the follow-up to Jackson's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off the Wall. Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off the Wall, including funk, disco, soul, soft rock, jazz and pop. However, Thriller's lyrics deal with generally darker themes, including paranoia and the supernatural.
With a production budget of $750,000, recording sessions took place between April and November of 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Assisted by producer Quincy Jones, Jackson wrote four of Thriller's nine tracks. Following the release of the album's first single &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;, some observers assumed Thriller would only be a minor hit record. With the release of the second single &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, the album topped the charts in many countries. It reached number one in the US and the UK simultaneously, becoming the first album to do so. At its peak, the album was selling a million copies a week worldwide. In just over a year, Thriller became the best-selling album of all time. Sales are estimated to be between 47&lt;U+2013&gt;108 million copies sold worldwide. Seven of the album's nine songs were released as singles, and all reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won a record-breaking seven Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys. Despite numerous five-star reviews, Thriller was not universally praised.
Thriller cemented Jackson as one of the predominant pop stars of the late 20th century, and enabled him to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meetings with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools&lt;U+2014&gt;the videos for Thriller, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Beat It&quot; all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo recording and the song &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot;, which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook.1 In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD.
Thriller ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in their Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. Thriller was preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry, as it was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot;.
Background
Jackson's previous album Off the Wall (1979) was a critical success and recieved generally favorable reviews.23 It was also a commercial success, eventually selling over 15 million copies worldwide.45 The years between Off the Wall and Thriller were a transitional period for the singer, a time of increasing independence and struggles with his family. When Jackson turned 21 in August 1979, he fired his father Joseph Jackson as his manager and replaced him with John Branca.6 Jackson confided in Branca that he wanted to be &quot;the biggest star in show business&quot; and &quot;the wealthiest&quot;. The singer was upset about what he perceived to be the under-performance of Off the Wall, stating, &quot;It was totally unfair that it didn't get Record of the Year and it can never happen again.&quot;7 He also felt undervalued by the music industry; when Jackson asked the publicist of Rolling Stone if they would be interested in doing a cover story on him, he declined, to which Jackson responded, &quot;I've been told over and over that black people on the cover of magazines doesn't sell copies ... Just wait. Someday those magazines are going to be begging me for an interview. Maybe I'll give them one. And maybe I won't.&quot;8 In 1980, Jackson secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37% of wholesale album profit.9
In 1973, Jackson's father began a secret affair with a woman 20 years younger than him; the couple had a child in secret. In 1980, Joseph Jackson told his family of the affair and child. Jackson, already angry with his father over his childhood abuse, felt so betrayed that he fell out with Joseph Jackson for many years.10 The period saw the singer become deeply unhappy; Jackson explained, &quot;Even at home, I'm lonely. I sit in my room sometimes and cry. It's so hard to make friends ... I sometimes walk around the neighborhood at night, just hoping to find someone to talk to. But I just end up coming home.&quot;11
Recording
Jackson reunited with Off the Wall producer Quincy Jones to record his sixth studio album. The pair worked together on 300 songs, nine of which were eventually included.221&quot;/&gt; Thriller was recorded between April and November in 1982, at a production budget of $750,000. Several members of the band Toto were also involved in the album's recording and production.12 Jackson wrote four songs for the record: &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; (with Paul McCartney), &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.13 Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write these songs on paper. Instead, he would dictate into a sound recorder; when recording he would sing from memory.1415
The relationship between Jackson and Jones became strained during the album's recording. Jackson spent much of his time rehearsing dance steps alone.16 When the album's nine songs were completed, both Jones and Jackson were unhappy with the result and remixed every song, spending a week on each.17 Jones believed that &quot;Billie Jean&quot; was not strong enough to be included on the record, but Jackson disagreed and kept it. Jones told Jackson that Thriller would be unlikely to sell successfully like Off the Wall had, because the market had since weakened. In response, Jackson threatened to cancel the album's release.221&quot;/&gt;
In one interview, Jackson said that he was inspired to create an album where &quot;every song was a killer&quot; and focused the basis of Thriller as to ask, &quot;Why can't every one be like a hit song?&quot;.18 Jones and songwriter Rod Temperton gave detailed accounts of what occurred for the 2001 reissue of the album. Jones discussed &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and why it was so personal to Jackson, who struggled to deal with a number of obsessed fans. Jones wanted the long introduction on the song to be shortened; however, Jackson insisted it remain because it made him want to dance.19 Jones and Jackson were determined to make a rock song that would appeal to all tastes and spent weeks looking for a suitable guitarist for the song &quot;Beat It&quot;, a song Jackson wrote and played drums on. Eventually, they found Eddie Van Halen of the rock band Van Halen.2021
When Rod Temperton wrote the song &quot;Thriller&quot;, he originally wanted to call it &quot;Starlight&quot; or &quot;Midnight Man&quot; but settled on it because he felt the name had merchandising potential.22 Always wanting a notable person to recite the closing lyrics, Temperton brought in actor Vincent Price, who completed his part in just two takes. Temperton wrote the spoken portion in a taxi on the way to the recording studio. Jones and Temperton said that some recordings were left off the final cut because they did not have the &quot;edginess&quot; of other album tracks.23
Music
According to Steve Huey of Allmusic, Thriller refined the strengths of Jackson's previous album Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.24 Notable tracks include the ballads &quot;The Lady in My Life&quot;, &quot;Human Nature&quot;, and &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;; the funk pieces &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;; and the disco set &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot; and &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;.25262728 &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; was written a few years prior to 1982 and has a similar sound to the material on Off The Wall. The song is accompanied by a bass and percussion background and the song's centrepiece, a climaxing Swahili chant, gave the song an international flavour.29 &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; tells of two friends' fight over a woman, arguing over who loves her more and concludes with a spoken rap.225&quot;/&gt;30
Despite the light pop flavour of these two records, Thriller, more so than Off the Wall, displayed foreshadowings of the contradictory thematic elements that would come to characterize Jackson's later work.31 With Thriller, Jackson would begin his association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.32 This is evident on the songs &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;.33 In &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, Jackson sings about an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered a child of hers; in &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; he argues against gossips and the media.3435 In the former song, Jones had Jackson sing vocal overdubs through a six-foot-long cardboard tube, and brought in jazz saxophonist Tom Scott to play a rare instrument, the lyricon, a wind-controlled analog synthesizer. Bassist Louis Johnson ran through his part on a Yamaha bass guitar. The song opens with a long bass-and-drums introduction.36 In the song &quot;Thriller&quot;, sound effects such as creaking door, thunder, feet walking on wooden planks, winds and howling dogs can be heard.37
The anti-gang-violence &quot;Beat It&quot; became a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece.3839 Jackson later said of &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;the point is no one has to be the tough guy, you can walk away from a fight and still be a man. You don't have to die to prove you're a man&quot;.225&quot;/&gt; &quot;Human Nature&quot; is a moody, introspective, this is conveyed in lyrics such as, &quot;Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street&quot;.225&quot;/&gt;
By the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded; Allmusic described him as a &quot;blindingly gifted vocalist&quot;.40 Rolling Stone compared his vocals to the &quot;breathless, dreamy stutter&quot; of Stevie Wonder. Their analysis was also that &quot;Jackson's feathery-timbered tenor is extraordinary beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very daringly&quot;.41 With the release of Thriller, Jackson could sing low&lt;U+2014&gt;down to a basso low C&lt;U+2014&gt;but he preferred to sing higher because pop tenors have more range to create style.42 Rolling Stone were of the opinion that Jackson was now singing in a &quot;fully adult voice&quot; that was &quot;tinged by sadness&quot;.43 &quot;P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)&quot;, credited to James Ingram and Quincy Jones, and &quot;Lady in My Life&quot; by Rod Temperton, both gave the album a stronger R&amp;B direction; the latter song was described as &quot;the closest Jackson has come to crooning a sexy, soulful ballad after his Motown years&quot; by Taraborrelli.225&quot;/&gt; The singer had already adopted a &quot;vocal hiccup&quot; which he continued to impalement in Thriller. The purpose of the hiccup&lt;U+2014&gt;somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping&lt;U+2014&gt;is to help promote a certain emotion; be it excitement, sadness or fear.44
Release and reception
Thriller was released on November 30, 1982, and simultaneously reached number one in the US and the UK; becoming the first album to do so.45 At its peak, Thriller sold one million copies worldwide per week.46 Seven singles were released from the album, including &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot;—which was seen as a poor choice for the lead release and led some to believe that the album would be a disappointment, and to suggestions that Jackson was bowing to a white audience.225&quot;/&gt; &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; was followed by the hit single &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, which made Thriller a chart-topper.4748 Success continued with the single &quot;Beat It&quot;, which featured guitarists Eddie Van Halen and Steve Lukather.49 The title track &quot;Thriller&quot; was released as a single and also became a hit internationally.225&quot;/&gt;
Thriller was mostly well received by critics. A four-star Rolling Stone review by Christopher Connelly described it as &quot;a zesty LP&quot; with a &quot;harrowing, dark message&quot;. Despite the positive response, the title track came under strong criticism. Rolling Stone expressed a negative sentiment, critising its &quot;degenerat[ion] into silly camp&quot;. The magazine expressed confusion at the use of Vincent Price over Count Floyd for the track's concluding rap.50 The New York Times gave a positive review of the album, and dedicated a large amount of its coverage to the song &quot;Human Nature&quot;. They described it as the most &quot;striking&quot; song on the record, and wrote, &quot;this is a haunting, brooding ballad by Steve Porcaro and John Bettis with an irresistible chorus and it should be an enormous hit&quot;. Concluding their review The New York Times added; &quot;there are other hits here, too, lots of them. Best of all, with a pervasive confidence infusing the album as a whole, Thriller suggests that Mr. Jackson's evolution as an artist is far from finished&quot;.51
Robert Christgau published a positive (A&lt;U+2212&gt;) graded overview of the album a few days before its release. He acknowledged that there were &quot;fillers&quot; on the record but still labeled it &quot;almost classic&quot;. He expressed the opinion that &quot;Beat It&quot; was the album's best track, calling it &quot;the triumph and the thriller&quot;, but criticized &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; as &quot;Michael's worst idea since 'Ben'&quot;. He was of the opinion that the collaboration did not work well, but still praised it for &quot;getting interracial love on the radio&quot;.52 A year after the album's release, Time summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, &quot;The pulse of America and much of the rest of the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, the asphalt aria of &quot;Beat It&quot;, the supremely cool chills of &quot;Thriller&quot;.53 Conversely, in a Melody Maker publication, Paolo Hewitt stated &quot;[t]his is not a good LP&quot;; in his opinion there were only &quot;two songs worthy of mention&quot;. &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; was praised as an &quot;exciting&quot;, &quot;uptempo electro-funk song&quot;, as was &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. Hewitt's stance was that as a whole, the album could only be described as &quot;bland&quot;, particularly the closing tracks. He summed up: &quot;Jackson seems to have lost his talent for turning gross into gold&quot;.54
The album won a record-breaking seven Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year.55 That same year, Jackson won eight American Music Awards, the Special Award of Merit and three MTV Video Music Awards.56 Thriller was recognized as the world's best-selling album on February 7, 1984, when it was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records.57 It is one of only three albums to remain in the top ten of the Billboard 200 for a full year, and spent 37 weeks at number one out of the 80 consecutive weeks it was in the top ten. The album was also the first of three to have seven Billboard Hot 100 top ten singles, and was the only album to be the best-seller of two years (1983&lt;U+2013&gt;1984) in the US. Thriller was certified 27x platinum in 2005 by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments of at least 27 million copies in the US giving it Double Diamond Award status there.5859 The album topped the charts in many countries, and sold 3.7 million copies in the UK.6061 Still popular today, Thriller sells an estimated 130,000 copies in the US per year; it reached number two in the US Catalog charts in February 2003 and number 39 in the UK in March 2007.62 The album is cited as having sold between 47 and 108 million copies worldwide; the Guinness Book of World Records lists Thriller as having sold 65 million copies as of 2007.63646566
Influence and legacy
Music industry
Blender described Jackson as the &quot;late twentieth century pre-eminent pop icon&quot;, while The New York Times gave the opinion that he was a &quot;musical phenomenon&quot;, and that &quot;in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else&quot;.6768 Jackson changed the way the industry functioned: both as an artistic persona, and as a financial, profitable entity. His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point; approximately $2 for each album sold. Jackson was at that time earning record-breaking profits from compact disc sales, and from the sale of copies of the documentary The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller; produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album.69 The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.70 Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, &quot;At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item&lt;U+2014&gt;like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie&lt;U+2014&gt;and started selling like a household staple&quot;.71
At the time of the albums release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&amp;M Records, read that, &quot;The whole industry has a stake in this success&quot;.72 Time magazine speculated that &quot;the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of $4.1 billion&quot;.73 Time summed up Thriller's impact as a &quot;restoration of confidence&quot; for an industry bordering on &quot;the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop&quot;. The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, &quot;Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too&quot;.74
Music videos and racial equality
Before the success of Thriller, many felt Jackson had struggled to get MTV airing because he was black.75 In an effort attain air time for Jackson, CBS Records President Walter Yetnikoff pressured MTV and declared, &quot;I'm not going to give you any more videos and I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy&quot;.76 His position persuaded MTV to begin airing &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and later &quot;Beat It&quot;, which led to a long partnership and later helped other black music artists to gain mainstream recognition.77 The popularity of his videos, such as &quot;Beat It&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, helped to place young channel &quot;on the map&quot;, and MTV's focus shifted in favour of pop and R&amp;B.7879  Jackson transformed the medium of music video into an art form and promotional tool through the use of complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and cameo appearances by well known personalities.80 When the 14-minute-long Thriller video aired, MTV ran it twice an hour to meet demand.81 The short film marked an increase in scale for music videos and has been named the best music video ever.82 The popularity of the video sent the album back to number one in the album chart, but Jackson's label did not support the release of the third music video from the album. They were already pleased with its success, so Jackson convinced MTV to fund the project.83271&quot;/&gt; Author, music critic and journalist Nelson George wrote in 2004, &quot;It's difficult to hear the songs from Thriller and disengage them from the videos. For most of us the images define the songs. In fact it could be argued that Michael is the first artist of the MTV age to have an entire album so intimately connected in the public imagination with its imagery&quot;.84 Short films like Thriller largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in &quot;Beat It&quot; has been frequently imitated.85 The choreography in Thriller has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from Bollywood to prisons in the Philippines.8687
For a black artist in the 1980s to that point, Jackson's success was unprecedented. According to The Washington Post, Thriller paved the way for other African-American artists such as Prince.88 &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; was credited for getting interracial love on the radio.89 Time noted, &quot;Jackson is the biggest thing since The Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular black singer ever&quot;.90
Contemporary appeal
Today, the albums is still viewed in a positive light by critics some two decades later. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album the maximum five stars, and wrote that the record had something to interest everyone. He believed it showcased harder funk and rock while remaining &quot;undeniably fun&quot;. He went on to compliment &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot; and said, &quot;The record's two best songs: 'Billie Jean, ...and the delirious 'Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'{{'}}, the freshest funk on the album [but] the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded.&quot; Erlewine gave the openion that it was an improvement on the artist's previous album, although Allmusic was critical of the title track, describing it as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and as having the effect of &quot;arriving in the middle of the record and sucking out its momentum&quot;.91 Slant Magazine gave the album five stars and, like the Allmusic review and the original Rolling Stone review, paid compliment to the lyrics of &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;.92
The author Nelson George wrote that Jackson &quot;has educated R. Kelly, Usher, Justin Timberlake and countless others with Thriller as a textbook&quot;.93 As a sign of the album's longevity, in 2003 Thriller was ranked at number 20 on the Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time.9495 In 2008, 25 years after its release, the record was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and, a few weeks later, was among 25 recordings preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally significant&quot;.9697
Reissues
Thriller was reissued in 2001 in an expanded set titled Thriller: Special Edition. The original tracks were re-mastered, and the album included a new booklet and bonus material, including the songs &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot;, and Jackson's original &quot;Billie Jean&quot; demo, as well as audio interviews with Jones and Temperton discussing the recording of the album.9899
In February 2008, Epic Records released Thriller 25; Jackson served as executive producer.100 Thriller 25 appeared on CD and vinyl with seven bonus tracks, a new song called &quot;For All Time&quot;, Vincent Price's voice-over, and five re-mixes featuring American artists Fergie, will.i.am, Kanye West, and Akon.101102103 It also included a DVD featuring three music videos, the Motown 25 &quot;Billie Jean&quot; performance, and a booklet with a message from Jackson.104 The ballad &quot;For All Time&quot; supposedly dates from 1982, but is often credited as being from Dangerous sessions.105 Two singles were released from the reissue: &quot;The Girl Is Mine 2008&quot; and &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008&quot;.
Thriller 25 was a commercial success and did particularly well as a reissue. It peaked at number one in eight countries and Europe. It peaked at number two in the US, number three in the UK and reached the top 10 in over 30 national charts. It was certified Gold in 11 countries including the UK, received a 2x Gold certification in France and received platinum certification in Poland.106107108 In the US, Thriller 25 was the second best-selling album of its release week, selling 166,000 copies, 14,000 short of reaching the number one position. It was ineligible for the Billboard 200 chart as a re-release, but stayed on the Pop Catalog Charts at number one for 10 weeks, the best sales on that chart since December 1996.109110111112 This was Jackson's best launch since Invincible in 2001; in 12 weeks the album had sold 556,000 copies in the US and three million copies worldwide.113114
