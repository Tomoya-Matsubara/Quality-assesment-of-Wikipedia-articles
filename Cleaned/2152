Culinary diplomacy, also known as gastrodiplomacy, is a type of cultural diplomacy, which itself is a subset of public diplomacy. Its basic premise is that &quot;the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach.&quot;1 Official government-sponsored culinary diplomacy programs have been established in Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, Peru, and the United States.2
Background and Definitions
The terms &quot;culinary diplomacy&quot; and &quot;gastrodiplomacy&quot; have been in use since the early 2000s, and have been popularized by the work of public diplomacy scholars Paul Rockower and Sam Chapple-Sokol. An early mention of the concept was in a 2002 Economist article about the Thai Kitchen of the World program.34 In a 2011 article published in the Taiwanese journal Issues &amp; Studies, Rockower wrote that &quot;Gastrodiplomacy is predicated on the notion that the easiest way to win hearts and minds is through the stomach.&quot;5 Chapple-Sokol wrote in a 2013 article in the journal The Hague Journal of Diplomacy that culinary diplomacy is &quot;the use of food and cuisine as an instrument to create cross-cultural understanding in the hopes of improving interactions and cooperation.&quot;6
Culinary Diplomacy versus Gastrodiplomacy
The two terms &quot;culinary diplomacy&quot; and &quot;gastrodiplomacy&quot; are used interchangeably by many, though some scholars have differentiated the terms. Rockower, for example, claims that gastrodiplomacy refers to a tool of public diplomacy, while culinary diplomacy serves as &quot;a means to further diplomatic protocol through cuisine.&quot;7 Chapple-Sokol writes that both of these fall under the broad categorization of &quot;culinary diplomacy,&quot; and differentiates between public and private culinary diplomacy.8 The former refers to culinary diplomacy being used as a tool of public diplomacy, and more specifically cultural diplomacy, while the latter &quot;occurs behind closed doors,&quot; akin to Rockower's definition.
Examples of Culinary Diplomacy Programs
Thailand
The Global Thai program, launched in 2002, was the first government-led culinary diplomacy initiative.9 Its intention was to build the number of Thai restaurants worldwide; according to the Thai government, the number went from 5,500 in 2002 to more than 10,000 in 2013, as well as to encourage more people worldwide to eat Thai cuisine.10
That program was followed by Thailand: Kitchen of the World, an eBook published to promote the program states the following:
Thai food and Thai cuisine from the past to the present are distinctive in their charms and characters. The cuisine is a proud heritage of the Thai people that they believe is second to none, and it has been handed down through generations. Apart from the delicate blend of tastes and the rich nutritional value, the elaborate arrangement of Thai food and the decorations with fruit and vegetable carvings make it all the more inviting. At the same time, Thai food and Thai cooking reflect the wisdom and culture of the Thai nation. Today, Thai food and Thai cuisine stand ready to make Thailand a proud Kitchen of the World.11
South Korea
South Korea launched its own culinary diplomacy program in 2009, a $77m investment entitled &quot;Korean Cuisine to the World or &quot;Global Hansik&quot;.12 The goals of the program, run by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, are to promote the unique nature and health qualities of Korean cuisine (hansik), as well as to increase the number of Korean restaurants worldwide to 40,000 by 2017.13 Projects undertaken by the Korean government include the opening of a kimchi institute, working to establish Korean cuisine as a course in internationally-recognized cooking schools, and the launch of a touring Korean food truck.14
Malaysia
In 2010, Malaysia undertook a similar project and launched the &quot;Malaysian Kitchen for the World.&quot; 15 The program, carried out by the Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation, has focused most of its efforts to promote Malaysian cuisine in the United States and United Kingdom.16 Malaysia is an especially appropriate country to conduct culinary diplomacy due to its history as a culinary crossroads and its current mix of Malay, Chinese, and Indian populations.
Peru
An official Peruvian culinary diplomacy program started in 2011, with Peru's application for its cuisine to be included in UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage like its neighbor Mexico.17 The Cocina Peruana Para El Mundo campaign has also been promoted by Peruvian chef Gaston Acurio, the owner of multiple restaurants worldwide as well as a co-creator of the documentary Per&lt;U+00FA&gt; Sabe, along with Spanish chef Ferran Adri&lt;U+00E0&gt;.18
The United States
In September 2012, the United States officially launched its Culinary Diplomacy Partnership Initiative.19 More than 80 chefs, including White House Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford, White House Executive Pastry Chef William Yosses, and Spanish-born chef Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s, were named to be members of the &quot;American Chef Corps.&quot; The initiative is organized by the United States State Department Office of Protocol. One goal of the program is to send members of the Chef Corps to American embassies abroad on public diplomacy missions to teach about American cuisine.

At the summit of culinary diplomacy is the Club des Chefs des Chefs,20 or the Leaders' Chefs' Club.

Current club members include Executive Chef Cristeta Comerford from The White House, Chef Bernard Vaussion of the &lt;U+00C9&gt;lys&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Palace, Chef Mark Flanagan, Chef to Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom, and Chef Machindra Kasture, Chef to the Indian President. The 2011 meeting of the Club took place in Paris, France and in Berlin, Germany, where the chefs met with both French President Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.21
The 2013 meeting of the Club will be hosted by White House Chef Cristeta Comerford and will take place in New York City and Washington, DC.22
