First Internet Bank of Indiana, sometimes called First Internet Bank or First IB, is one of the first state-chartered, FDIC-insured institutions to operate solely via the Internet.
The bank was founded in 1997 by entrepreneur David B. Becker, incorporated on October 28, 1998, and opened to the public on February 22, 1999. It is engaged primarily in online retail banking and investment in securities. Services include interest-bearing checking accounts, regular and money market savings accounts, CDs, IRAs, credit cards, and check cards. The bank also offers personal lines of credit, installment loans, real-time transfers between accounts, and the ability to display checking, savings and loan information on a single screen.
First IB is a privately capitalized institution with over 300 private and corporate investors. On March 21, 2006, the bank consummated a Plan of Exchange by which the bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp, a single-bank holding company.
