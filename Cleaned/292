&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; is a song written by American singer-songwriters Ne-Yo and Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles, and Norwegian songwriters Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Espen Lind, and Amund Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rklund for Knowles' second studio album B&lt;U+2019&gt;Day. Produced by Norwegian production team Stargate and Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;, the song was released as the album's third single domestically, and the second single outside North America in October 2006. &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 16, 2006, making it Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s eighth Billboard number-one, and her fourth as a solo artist (her first without a guest rapper). It has sold over two million copies in digital sales.1 It was the last U.S. #1 of 2006 and the first of 2007.
&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; was the Billboard Hot 100 number-one single for ten weeks, and has received world wide critical acclaim. In the United States, it has become the most successful song of her solo career. In December of 2006, a Spanish-language version of &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; entitled &quot;Irreemplazable&quot; (which means &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;) was released. This remix has peaked on #4 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs. It has also been faring fairly well on charts in Latin countries and will be included in her Spanish language re-release of B'Day. In the UK the song was used, along with Beyonce, in TV commercials for the Samsung Ultra Music SGH-F300 cell-phone.
Writing and inspiration
What started this song was a musical idea. Stargate Produced the track, using acoustic guitar parts made by Espen Lind and Amund Bj&lt;U+00F8&gt;rklund, and then making it into a full track with drums, bass and strings. This beat was presented to Ne-Yo who loved the idea, and wrote lyrics and melody on the spot. The song was then played to Beyonce&lt;U+00B4&gt; and she recorded the song for her B&lt;U+00B4&gt;Day album.
According to Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; is meant to empower her female fans by encouraging them to end bad relationships: &quot;[Irreplaceable] is a secret weapon...It's a celebration of a breakup and makes women feel like they're worth more.&quot;2
Music and structure
&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; is an R&amp;B song written in the key of B&lt;U+266D&gt; major.3 It is written in common time and moves at a moderate 100 beats per minute.4 Knowles' vocal range spans nearly an octave and a half, from B&lt;U+266D&gt;3 to E&lt;U+266D&gt;5.5
Critical reception
The song was well-received by critics. While many of the tracks from B&lt;U+2019&gt;Day have been upbeat club-bangers, featuring heavy 808-driven beats, &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; has been praised by critics for its simple, guitar-driven melody. Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song four and a half stars, and characterized it as &quot;one of the strongest&quot; tracks from the album. He praised Stargate for the &quot;simple, pop-oriented production&quot; and the &quot;subject matter of female strength and independence.&quot;6 Lamb ranked &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; the fourth best R&amp;B song of 2006.7 Barry Schwartz of Stylus Magazine wrote that &quot;[Irreplaceable] recaptured &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;&lt;U+2019&gt;s near-perfection....[and features] her most genuinely emotional vocal to date, equal parts vulnerable, upset, pissed off, vindictive, resigned, and apathetic.&quot;8
For Entertainment Weekly, Jody Rosen said the track was &quot;a lilting tune unlike anything Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; has ever performed,&quot;9 while Billboard magazine praised &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;'s simplicity and 'radio-friendliness,' noting that the &quot;song dilutes the excessive instrumentation of B's first two singles in favor of smooth drum taps and guitar strumming&quot; and &quot;should blast off at radio.&quot;10 In their review of B'Day, the popular indie-oriented website Pitchfork Media declared &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; the album's best song, calling it &quot;(Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s) most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date&quot;.11 Irreplaceable won the Soul Train Music Award for &quot;Best R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Single, Female,&quot; and the Nickelodeon Kid's Choice Award for &quot;Favorite Song&quot;. Beyonce also won Video of the Year at the 2007 BET Awards for Irreplaceable and also winning Best Female R&amp;B Artist of the Year.

Chart performance
&quot;Irreplaceable&quot; has entered various charts around the world, and has become the most successful single from B&lt;U+2019&gt;Day. The single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated November 4, 2006 at position eighty-seven, and climbed the charts rapidly because of heavy airplayâ€” it received the &quot;Greatest Airplay Gainer&quot; certification for seven weeks, six of which were consecutive.

Only Mariah Carey's &quot;We Belong Together&quot; has bested that total; it garnered 223 million impressions during a week in July 15, 2005.14
