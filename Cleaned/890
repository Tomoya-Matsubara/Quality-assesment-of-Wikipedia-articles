Baby Boy is a song recorded by American recording artist Beyonc, featuring Jamaican reggae singer Sean Paul. It was composed by Knowles, Paul, Scott Storch, Robert Waller and Jay-Z for her 2003 debut studio album Dangerously in Love. It was also on the Grammy Awards winning album Dutty Rock which was re-released in 2003.   Containing a lyrical interpolation of No Fear by hip hop music hip hop group Originoo Gunn Clappaz O.G.C, Baby Boy is an R&B and dancehall song with Arabic music influences; its lyrics detail a woman's fantasies. The song was considered to be a sequel to Knowles' 2002 collaboration with Jay-Z on '03 Bonnie & Clyde.
Columbia Records released Baby Boy, the second single from Dangerously in Love, to United States radios on August 3, 2003. It was well received by music critics, who complimented the Music of India Indian, Middle Eastern music and dancehall styles in the song, as well as Knowles' collaboration with Paul. Baby Boy topped the US Billboard Hot 100 Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks, and was Knowles' longest-running solo number-one single until 2007. It reached the top ten in many countries, and was certified platinum in Australia and the US.
The song's music video was directed by Jake Nava and mostly shows Knowles dancing in various locations. Baby Boy has remained a staple of Knowles' concert set list. The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers ASCAP recognized it as one of the most performed songs of 2005. During the same year, US singer-songwriter Jennifer Armour filed a copyright infringement lawsuit claiming that Knowles had used the primary musical hook music hook from her song Got a Little Bit of Love for You. The suit was dismissed.

A short section of the reggae classic Murder She Wrote was incorporated into Baby Boy. Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised the performance, writing that Knowles needs no distractions from her singing, which can be airy or brassy, tearful or vicious, rapid-fire with staccato syllables or sustained in curlicued melismas. But she was in constant motion, strutting in costumes. She performed in a similar arrangement at the Los Angeles' Staples Center on September 2, 2007. She was dressed in a belly dancing outfit, and the performance was executed with several male backup dancers and live instrumentation.cite video people=Beyonc Knowles title=The Beyonc Experience Live date=2007 publisher=Columbia Records Knowles re-produced the dance she executed in the song's  music video.

With regard to the musical hook, the Expert stated in his report, When the aural comparisons of the two songs are presented in the key of C Minor for easy comparison and presented back-to-back, in ABAB fashion, even the least musically inclined listener should immediately determine that the two songs are strikingly similar; I daresay that many listeners may even perceive them as being the same song! And again, transposing a song for this purpose does not alter any fundamental qualities or characteristics of the song but merely assists the ability of those unfamiliar with the technicalities of music in making a comparison.  The district court judge nonetheless ruled that she, herself, could not hear the similarities between the two songs and dismissed the case, denying the motion for the songs or case to be heard by a jury.
On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling, but ruled with different reasoning.  It held that there was no infringement based on Knowles' claim that Armour's demo tape was received shortly after the writing of Knowles' song had been substantially completed.  However, the court did not address the issue of substantial similarity.cite web url=http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cpub%5C06/06-20934-CV0.wpd.pdf  title=Armour v.
