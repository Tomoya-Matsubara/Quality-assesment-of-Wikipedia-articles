Incidents and accidents

The incident was caused by the aircraft being overweight, due to excess fuel having been uploaded, making the aircraft  overweight. After being informed of the tailstrike, the crew continued the flight to the Cape Verde Islands, where inspection revealed that a tailstrike had occurred, although the tailstrike indicator was within limits. The incident was investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which made four safety recommendations.
