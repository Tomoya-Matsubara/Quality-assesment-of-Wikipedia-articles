The AM (A Modified) type submarine was a large seaplane-carrying submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with a hangar space for 2 aircraft. These giant submarines were originally of the A2 type, but their design was revised after construction started so that they could carry a second aircraft. The seaplanes were to be the Aichi M6A1, bomber carrying 800 kg bombs.
The range and speed of these submarines was remarkable (21,000 nm at 16 knots), but their underwater performance was compromised, making them easy targets. I-13 was sunk on 16 July 1945 by the destroyer escort USS Lawrence C. Taylor and aircraft action from escort carrier USS Anzio about 550 miles east of Yokosuka. I-14 surrendered at sea at the end of the war, and was later scuttled off Oahu in 1946.
