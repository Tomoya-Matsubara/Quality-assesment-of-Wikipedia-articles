One of the contacts was Daws Butler, who voiced characters such as Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, The Jetsons Elroy Jetson and Yogi Bear. Cartwright decided to try to call him, and left a message on his answering machine in which she used a cockney accent. Butler immediately called her back and agreed to mentor her on voice acting. He sent her a script in the mail, instructing her to make a tape recording of herself reading it and to send it back to him. He would then critique it and send her notes. Butler continued to train her in this method for the next year, sending her a new script every few weeks. Cartwright described Butler as absolutely amazing, always encouraging, and always polite.Cartwright, p. 14.

After about twenty minutes, he said, 'considering your background, I don't see how I could cast anyone but you in this part!' It was her first role in a feature film.Cartwright, pp. 26&ndash;27. She continued to work in voice-over roles, including Pound Puppies, Popeye and Son, Snorks, My Little Pony TV series My Little Pony, Saturday Supercade and the film The Chipmunk Adventure.Cartwright, pp. 27&ndash;28. She joined a Dubbing filmmaking loop group, and recorded vocals for characters in the background of films, although in most cases the sound was turned down so very little of her voice could be heard. She did minor voice-over work for several films, including Clan of the Cave Bear, Silverado film Silverado, Sixteen Candles, Back to the Future 2 and The Color Purple.Cartwright, p. 29. The most notable of these was a role in Who Framed Roger Rabbit as a shoe that was dipped in acid. It was her first off-screen death scene and she worked hard to correctly convey the scene's emotion.

The Simpsons

Cartwright became most famous for her role as Bart Simpson on the long-running animated television show The Simpsons. On March 13, 1987, Nancy Cartwright went in to audition for the role of a series of animated shorts about a dysfunctional family on The Tracey Ullman Show, a live-action variety show. The show featured shorts as bumpers, and aired between sketches. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. After arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the middle child and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, and clever.Cartwright, pp. 3540 Creator Matt Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot.cite web url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1017238.stm title=Bart's voice tells all accessdate=2009-02-05 date=2000-11-10 publisher=BBC News Bart's voice came naturally to Cartwright; prior to The Tracey Ullman Show, she had used elements of it in My Little Pony, Snorks, and Pound Puppies. Cartwright describes Bart's voice as easy to perform compared to other characters. The recording of the shorts was often primitive, the dialog was recorded on a portable tape deck in a makeshift studio which consisted of the video engineer suite, above the bleachers on The Tracey Ullman show set. Cartwright described the sessions as great fun, but she also wanted to appear on the live-action portion of the show. She occasionally showed up for recording sessions early in hopes of being noticed by a producer and used in a sketch.Cartwright, pp. 43&ndash;50. 
In 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show on Fox Broadcasting Company Fox called The Simpsons.

Cartwright is the only one of the six main Simpsons cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show.#Turner Turner, p. 21 She traditionally does five or six readings of every line in order to give the producers more to work with. The catchphrase Eat My Shorts was an ad-lib by Cartwright in one of the original table readings, harking back to an incident when she was in high school. Cartwright was a member of the marching band at Fairmont High School, and one day while performing, the band chanted Eat my shorts rather than the usual Fairmont West!
