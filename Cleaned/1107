 Skywalker Sound is the sound effects, sound editorial, sound design and music recording division of George Lucas's Lucas Digital motion picture group. Its main facilities are located in Lucas Valley, near Nicasio, California. It began as Sprocket Systems in San Anselmo, California and changed names soon after the release of The Empire Strikes Back.
While located in San Anselmo, Sprocket Systems came into contact with the local residents from time to time. For instance, Kentfield resident Pat Walsh, &quot;discovered&quot; while shopping at a camera store, provided the voice for E.T.. During the sound recording of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford could be spied practicing his bullwhip technique in the parking lot.1
Sprocket Systems moved from San Anselmo following a disastrous flood in January of 1982.
Its staff of Sound Designers and Re-Recording Mixers have either won or been nominated for the Best Sound or Best Sound Editing Academy Award every year since Star Wars in 1978 (in that year Ben Burtt was given a Special Achievement Award, since the category for Sound Editing had not yet been established).
Dubbing facilities, editorial services and scoring stages are all located in a central &quot;Tech Building,&quot; with dining areas and living quarters in the vicinity but separate from the main work area.
