This article is about Airport Station of the MTR, for the line of the same name, see Airport Express (MTR).
Airport (Traditional Chinese: &lt;U+6A5F&gt;&lt;U+5834&gt;; Jyutping: gei1 coeng4; pinyin: j&lt;U+012B&gt; ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;ng) was the western terminus station on Airport Express of Hong Kong's MTR, before the opening of the AsiaWorld-Expo station on 20 December 2005. It serves the Hong Kong International Airport. The station is integrated with the Passenger Terminal of the airport, and for the convenience of the travellers, no exit or entry gates are installed. Therefore, travellers can walk straight into the terminal building through the exit for their check-in procedures. (If they have not completed In-Town Check-in.) Ticket baskets are provided on the departure level for the travellers to dump their used tickets in. A souvenir shop is also found there.
Platform 3 has been constructed opposite to platform 1 to allow for access to SkyPlaza and Terminal 2. The new platform started operation on February 28, 20071 when the additional check-in facilities opened at Terminal 2. Airport Express trains stopping at the station now opens its two doors simultaneously for both platforms - doors on the left opens for travellers going to Terminal 1, and doors on the right opens for travellers going to SkyPlaza (Terminal 2).
