In probability theory, the central limit theorem CLT states that, given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of Statistical independence independent random variables, each with a well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately normal distribution normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.cite web url=http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/sample/CLT.html That is, suppose that a Sample statistics sample is obtained containing a large number of Random variate observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic average of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the computed values of the average will be Probability distribution distributed according to the normal distribution commonly known as a bell curve.
The central limit theorem has a number of variants. In its common form, the random variables must be identically distributed. In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions, given that they comply with certain conditions.
In more general probability theory, a central limit theorem is any of a set of Weak convergence of measures weak-convergence theorems. They all express the fact that a sum of many Independent and identically distributed random variables independent and identically distributed i.i.d. random variables, or alternatively, random variables with specific types of dependence, will tend to be distributed according to one of a small set of attractor distributions. When the variance of the i.i.d. variables is finite, the attractor distribution is the normal distribution. In contrast, the sum of a number of i.i.d. random variables with power law tail distributions decreasing as  x 1 where 0   as the number of variables grows.Citation  first1=Johannes  last1=Voit  page=124  year=2003 title=The Statistical Mechanics of Financial Markets publisher=Springer-Verlag isbn=3-540-00978-7

 Classical CLT 
Let X1, ..., Xn be a random sample of size n  that is, a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from distributions of expected values given by  and finite variances given by 2. Suppose we are interested in the sample mean sample average
:S_n := \fracX_1+\cdots+X_nn
of these random variables. By the law of large numbers, the sample averages Convergence of random variables#Convergence in probability converge in probability and Convergence of random variables#Almost sure convergence almost surely to the expected value  as n  . The classical central limit theorem describes the size and the distributional form of the stochastic fluctuations around the deterministic number  during this convergence. More precisely, it states that as n gets larger, the distribution of the difference between the sample average Sn and its limit , when multiplied by the factor sqrt n that is sqrt nSn  , approximates the normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2. For large enough n, the distribution of Sn is close to the normal distribution with mean  and variance frac2 2 n. The usefulness of the theorem is that the distribution of sqrt nSn   approaches normality regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual Xis. Formally, the theorem can be stated as follows:
LindebergLvy CLT. Suppose X1, X2, ... is a sequence of independent and identically distributed i.i.d. random variables with EXi =  and VarXi = 2 . Then as n approaches infinity, the random variables sqrt nSn   convergence in distribution converge in distribution to a normal distribution normal N0, 2:Billingsley 1995, p.357
:\sqrtn\bigg\bigg\frac1n\sum_i=1^n X_i\bigg - \mu\bigg\ \xrightarrowd\ N0,\;\sigma^2.
In the case    0, convergence in distribution means that the cumulative distribution functions of sqrt nSn   converge pointwise to the cdf of the N0, 2 distribution: for every real number z,
:\lim_n\to\infty \Pr\sqrtnS_n-\mu \le z = \Phiz/\sigma,
where x is the standard normal cdf evaluated at x. Note that the convergence is uniform in z in the sense that
:\lim_n\to\infty\sup_z\in\mathbf R\bigl \Pr\sqrtnS_n-\mu \le z - \Phiz/\sigma\bigr  = 0,
where sup denotes the least upper bound or supremum of the set.Bauer 2001, Theorem 30.13, p.199
 Lyapunov CLT 
The theorem is named after Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov. In this variant of the central limit theorem the random variables Xi have to be independent, but not necessarily identically distributed. The theorem also requires that random variables  Xi  have moment mathematics moments of some order 2 + , and that the rate of growth of these moments is limited by the Lyapunov condition given below.
Lyapunov CLT.Billingsley 1995, p.362 Suppose X1, X2, ... is a sequence of independent random variables, each with finite expected value i and variance SubSup  i 2. Define
:s_n^2 = \sum_i=1^n \sigma_i^2
If for some    0, the Lyapunovs condition
: \lim_n\to\infty \frac1s_n^2+\delta \sum_i=1^n \operatornameE\big\, X_i - \mu_i ^2+\delta\,\big = 0
is satisfied, then a sum of Xi  i/sn converges in distribution to a standard normal random variable, as n goes to infinity:
: \frac1s_n \sum_i=1^n X_i - \mu_i \ \xrightarrowd\ \mathcalN0,\;1.
In practice it is usually easiest to check the Lyapunovs condition for  = 1. If a sequence of random variables satisfies Lyapunovs condition, then it also satisfies Lindebergs condition. The converse implication, however, does not hold.
 Lindeberg CLT 
Main Lindeberg's condition
In the same setting and with the same notation as above, the Lyapunov condition can be replaced with the following weaker one from Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg Lindeberg in 1920.
Suppose that for every    0
:  \lim_n \to \infty \frac1s_n^2\sum_i = 1^n \operatornameE\bigX_i - \mu_i^2 \cdot \mathbf1_\   X_i - \mu_i     \varepsilon s_n \  \big = 0
where 1 is the indicator function. Then the distribution of the standardized sums \frac1s_n\sum_i = 1^n \left X_i - \mu_i \right converges towards the standard normal distribution N0,1.
 Multidimensional CLT 
Proofs that use characteristic functions can be extended to cases where each individual X1, ..., Xn is an independent and identically distributed random vector in Rk, with mean vector  = EXi and covariance matrix  amongst the individual components of the vector. Now, if we take the summations of these vectors as being done componentwise, then the multidimensional central limit theorem  states that when scaled, these converge to a multivariate normal distribution.Citation last = Van der Vaart first = A.

Let
:\mathbfX_i=\beginbmatrix X_i1 \\ \vdots \\ X_ik \endbmatrix
be the i-vector. The bold in Xi means that it is a random vector, not a random univariate variable. Then the sum of the random vectors will be
:\beginbmatrix X_11 \\ \vdots \\ X_1k \endbmatrix+\beginbmatrix X_21 \\ \vdots \\ X_2k \endbmatrix+\cdots+\beginbmatrix X_n1 \\ \vdots \\ X_nk \endbmatrix = \beginbmatrix \sum_i=1^n \left  X_i1 \right  \\ \vdots \\ \sum_i=1^n \left  X_ik \right  \endbmatrix = \sum_i=1^n \left  \mathbfX_i \right 
and the average will be

 Central limit theorems for dependent processes 
 CLT under weak dependence 
A useful generalization of a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables is a Mixing mathematics mixing random process in discrete time; mixing means, roughly, that random variables temporally far apart from one another are nearly independent. Several kinds of mixing are used in ergodic theory and probability theory. See especially Mixing mathematics#Mixing in stochastic processes strong mixing also called -mixing defined by n  0 where n is so-called Mixing mathematics#Mixing in stochastic processes strong mixing coefficient.
A simplified formulation of the central limit theorem under strong mixing is:Billingsley 1995, Theorem 27.4
Theorem. Suppose that X1, X2,  is stationary and -mixing with n = On5 and that EXn = 0 and EXn2 . Denote Sn = X1 +  + Xn, then the limit
: \sigma^2 = \lim_n \fracES_n^2n 
exists, and if   0 then  S_n / \sigma \sqrt n  converges in distribution to N0, 1.
In fact,
:\sigma^2  = EX_1^2 + 2 \sum_k=1^\infty EX_1 X_1+k,
where the series converges absolutely.
The assumption   0 cannot be omitted, since the asymptotic normality fails for Xn = Yn  Y'n1 where Yn are another stationary sequence.
There is a stronger version of the theorem:Durrett 2004, Sect. 7.7c, Theorem 7.8 the assumption EXn12  is replaced with nowrap E!Xn!2 +  ,  and the assumption n = On5 is replaced with \sum_n \alpha_n^\frac\delta22+\delta  Existence of such    0 ensures the conclusion.

 Remarks 
 Proof of classical CLT 
For a theorem of such fundamental importance to statistics and applied probability, the central limit theorem has a remarkably simple proof using characteristic function probability theory characteristic functions.  It is similar to the proof of a weak Proof of the law of large numbers law of large numbers.  For any random variable, Y, with zero mean and a unit variance varY = 1, the characteristic function of Y is, by Taylor's theorem,
:\varphi_Yt = 1 - t^2 \over 2 + ot^2, \quad t \rightarrow 0
where o t2 is Big O notation little o notation for some function of t that goes to zero more rapidly than t2.
Letting Yi be Xi  /, the standardized value of Xi, it is easy to see that the Standard score#Standardizing in mathematical statistics standardized mean of the observations X1, X2, ..., X'n is
:Z_n = \fracn\overlineX_n-n\mu\sigma \sqrtn =\sum_i=1^n Y_i \over \sqrtn
By simple properties of characteristic functions, the characteristic function of the sum is:
:\varphi_Z_n =\varphi_\sum_i=1^n Y_i \over \sqrtn\leftt\right = \varphi_Y_1 \leftt / \sqrtn \right \cdot \varphi_Y_2 \leftt / \sqrtn \right\cdots \varphi_Y_n \leftt / \sqrtn \right = \left\varphi_Y\leftt \over \sqrtn\right\right^n
so that, by the limit of the exponential function math  ex= lim1+x/nn the characteristic function of Z'n is
:\left\varphi_Y\leftt \over \sqrtn\right\right^n = \left 1 - t^2 \over 2n + o\leftt^2 \over n\right \right^n \, \rightarrow \, e^-t^2/2, \quad n \rightarrow \infty.
But this limit is just the characteristic function of a standard normal distribution N0, 1, and the central limit theorem follows from the Lvy continuity theorem, which confirms that the convergence of characteristic functions implies convergence in distribution.
Convergence to the limit
The central limit theorem gives only an asymptotic distribution. As an approximation for a finite number of observations, it provides a reasonable approximation only when close to the peak of the normal distribution; it requires a very large number of observations to stretch into the tails.
If the third central Moment mathematics moment EX1  3 exists and is finite, then the above convergence is uniform convergence uniform and the speed of convergence is at least on the order of 1/n1/2 see Berry-Esseen theorem.

The convergence to the normal distribution is monotonic, in the sense that the information entropy entropy of Z'n increases monotonic function monotonically to that of the normal distribution.
The central limit theorem applies in particular to sums of independent and identically distributed discrete random variables.  A sum of discrete random variables is still a discrete random variable, so that we are confronted with a sequence of discrete random variables whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable namely that of the normal distribution.  This means that if we build a histogram of the realisations of the sum of n independent identical discrete variables, the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as n approaches infinity, this relation is known as de MoivreLaplace theorem. The binomial distribution article details such an application of the central limit theorem in the simple case of a discrete variable taking only two possible values.
Relation to the law of large numbers
More footnotes section date=April 2012
Law of large numbers The law of large numbers as well as the central limit theorem are partial solutions to a general problem: What is the limiting behaviour of S'n as n approaches infinity? In mathematical analysis, asymptotic series are one of the most popular tools employed to approach such questions.
Suppose we have an asymptotic expansion of fn:
: fn= a_1 \varphi_1n+a_2 \varphi_2n+O\varphi_3n \qquad  n \rightarrow \infty.
Dividing both parts by 1n and taking the limit will produce a1, the coefficient of the highest-order term in the expansion, which represents the rate at which fn changes in its leading term.
: \lim_n\to\infty\fracfn\varphi_1n=a_1.
Informally, one can say: fn grows approximately as a1 1n. Taking the difference between fn and its approximation and then dividing by the next term in the expansion, we arrive at a more refined statement about fn:
: \lim_n\to\infty\fracfn-a_1 \varphi_1n\varphi_2n=a_2 .
Here one can say that the difference between the function and its approximation grows approximately as a2 2n.  The idea is that dividing the function by appropriate normalizing functions, and looking at the limiting behavior of the result, can tell us much about the limiting behavior of the original function itself.
Informally, something along these lines is happening when the sum, Sn, of independent identically distributed random variables, X1, ..., Xn, is studied in classical probability theory.Citation needed date=April 2012  If each Xi has finite mean , then by the law of large numbers, Sn/n  .Rosenthal, Jeffrey Seth 2000 A first look at rigorous probability theory, World Scientific, ISBN 981-02-4322-7.Theorem 5.3.4, p. 47  If in addition each Xi has finite variance 2, then by the central limit theorem,
:  \fracS_n-n\mu\sqrtn \rightarrow \xi ,
where  is distributed as N0, 2.  This provides values of the first two constants in the informal expansion
: S_n \approx \mu n+\xi \sqrtn. \, 
In the case where the X'is do not have finite mean or variance, convergence of the shifted and rescaled sum can also occur with different centering and scaling factors:
:\fracS_n-a_nb_n \rightarrow \Xi,
or informally
: S_n \approx a_n+\Xi b_n. \, 
Distributions  which can arise in this way are called stable distribution stable.Johnson, Oliver Thomas 2004 Information theory and the central limit theorem,  Imperial College Press, 2004, ISBN 1-86094-473-6. p. 88  Clearly, the normal distribution is stable, but there are also other stable distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution, for which the mean or variance are not defined.  The scaling factor bn may be proportional to nc, for any c  1/2; it may also be multiplied by a slowly varying function of n.Vladimir V. Uchaikin and V. M. Zolotarev 1999 Chance and stability: stable distributions and their applications, VSP. ISBN 90-6764-301-7.pp. 6162Borodin, A. N. ; Ibragimov, Il'dar Abdulovich;  Sudakov, V. N. 1995 Limit theorems for functionals of random walks,  AMS Bookstore, ISBN 0-8218-0438-3. Theorem 1.1, p. 8 
The law of the iterated logarithm specifies what is happening in between the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Specifically it says that the normalizing function  \sqrtn\log\log n  intermediate in size between n of the law of large numbers and n of the central limit theorem provides a non-trivial limiting behavior.
Alternative statements of the theorem
=Density functions=
The probability density function density of the sum of two or more independent variables is the convolution of their densities if these densities exist.  Thus the central limit theorem can be interpreted as a statement about the properties of density functions under convolution: the convolution of a number of density functions tends to the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound. These theorems require stronger hypotheses than the forms of the central limit theorem given above. Theorems of this type are often called local limit theorems. See,Citation last=Petrov first=V.V. title=Sums of Independent Random Variables year=1976 publisher=Springer-Verlag location=New York-Heidelberg Chapter 7 for a particular local limit theorem for sums of i.i.d. random variables.
=Characteristic functions=
Since the characteristic function probability theory characteristic function of a convolution is the product of the characteristic functions of the densities involved, the central limit theorem has yet another restatement: the product of the characteristic functions of a number of density functions becomes close to the characteristic function of the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound, under the conditions stated above. However, to state this more precisely, an appropriate scaling factor needs to be applied to the argument of the characteristic function.
An equivalent statement can be made about Fourier transforms, since the characteristic function is essentially a Fourier transform.
Extensions to the theorem
Products of positive random variables
The logarithm of a product is simply the sum of the logarithms of the factors.  Therefore when the logarithm of a product of random variables that take only positive values approaches a normal distribution, the product itself approaches a log-normal distribution.  Many physical quantities especially mass or length, which are a matter of scale and cannot be negative are the products of different random factors, so they follow a log-normal distribution.
Whereas the central limit theorem for sums of random variables requires the condition of finite variance, the corresponding theorem for products requires the corresponding condition that the density function be square-integrable.
Beyond the classical framework
Asymptotic normality, that is, Convergence of random variables#Convergence in distribution convergence to the normal distribution after appropriate shift and rescaling, is a phenomenon much more general than the classical framework treated above, namely, sums of independent random variables or vectors. New frameworks are revealed from time to time; no single unifying framework is available for now.
Convex body
Theorem.  There exists a sequence n  0 for which the following holds. Let n  1, and let random variables X1, , Xn have a Logarithmically concave function log-concave Probability density function#Probability functions associated with multiple variables joint density f such that nowrap fx1, , xn = f!x1!, , !xn! for all x1, , xn,  and EXk2 = 1 for all k = 1, , n. Then the distribution of
: \fracX_1+\cdots+X_n\sqrt n 
is n-close to N0, 1 in the Total variation distance of probability measures total variation distance.Klartag 2007, Theorem 1.2
These two n-close distributions have densities in fact, log-concave densities, thus, the total variance distance between them is the integral of the absolute value of the difference between the densities. Convergence in total variation is stronger than weak convergence.
An important example of a log-concave density is a function constant inside a given convex body and vanishing outside; it corresponds to the uniform distribution on the convex body, which explains the term central limit theorem for convex bodies.
Another example: nowrap fx1, , xn = const  exp  !x1! +  + !xn! where    1 and    1. If  = 1 then fx1, , xn factorizes into nowrap const  exp   !x1!exp  !xn!,  which means independence of X1, , Xn. In general, however, they are dependent.
The condition nowrap fx1, , xn = f!x1!, , !xn! ensures that X1, , Xn are of zero mean and uncorrelated;Citation needed date=June 2012 still, they need not be independent, nor even Pairwise independence pairwise independent.Citation needed date=June 2012 By the way, pairwise independence cannot replace independence in the classical central limit theorem.Durrett 2004, Section 2.4, Example 4.5

The distribution of  X_1+\dots+X_n/\sqrt n  need not be approximately normal in fact, it can be uniform.Klartag 2007, Theorem 1.1 However, the distribution of c1X1 +  + cnXn is close to N0, 1 in the total variation distance for most of vectors c1, , cn according to the uniform distribution on the sphere c12 +  + cn2 = 1.

In the bottom-right graph, smoothed profiles of the previous graphs are rescaled, superimposed and compared with a normal distribution black curve.
A simple example of the central limit theorem is rolling a large number of identical, unbiased dice. The distribution of the sum or average of the rolled numbers will be well approximated by a normal distribution. Since real-world quantities are often the balanced sum of many unobserved random events, the central limit theorem also provides a partial explanation for the prevalence of the normal probability distribution. It also justifies the approximation of large-sample statistics to the normal distribution in controlled experiments.

It also compares the observed distributions with the distributions that would be expected for a normalized Gaussian distribution, and shows the Pearson's chi-squared test chi-squared values that quantify the goodness of the fit the fit is good if the reduced Pearson's chi-squared test chi-squared value is less than or approximately equal to one.  The input into the normalized Gaussian function is the mean of sample means ~50 and the mean sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size ~28.87/sqrt n, which is called the standard deviation of the mean since it refers to the spread of sample means.

Published literature contains a number of useful and interesting examples and applications relating to the central limit theorem.Dinov, Christou & Sanchez 2008 One sourcehttp://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_GCLT_Applications SOCR CLT Activity wiki states the following examples:
The probability distribution for total distance covered in a random walk biased or unbiased will tend toward a normal distribution.
Flipping a large number of coins will result in a normal distribution for the total number of heads or equivalently total number of tails.
From another viewpoint, the central limit theorem explains the common appearance of the Bell Curve in density estimation density estimates applied to real world data. In cases like electronic noise, examination grades, and so on, we can often regard a single measured value as the weighted average of a large number of small effects. Using generalisations of the central limit theorem, we can then see that this would often though not always produce a final distribution that is approximately normal.
In general, the more a measurement is like the sum of independent variables with equal influence on the result, the more normality it exhibits. This justifies the common use of this distribution to stand in for the effects of unobserved variables in models like the linear model.
Regression
Regression analysis and in particular ordinary least squares specifies that a dependent variable depends according to some function upon one or more independent variables, with an additive Errors and residuals in statistics error term. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption can be justified by assuming that the error term is actually the sum of a large number of independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be assumed to be normally distributed.

Main Illustration of the central limit theorem
Given its importance to statistics, a number of papers and computer packages are available that demonstrate the convergence involved in the central limit theorem.

History
Tijms writes:
quote The central limit theorem has an interesting history. The first version of this theorem was postulated by the French-born mathematician Abraham de Moivre who, in a remarkable article published in 1733, used the normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the number of heads resulting from many tosses of a fair coin. This finding was far ahead of its time, and was nearly forgotten until the famous French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace rescued it from obscurity in his monumental work Thorie Analytique des Probabilits, which was published in 1812.  Laplace expanded De Moivre's finding by approximating the binomial distribution with the normal distribution. But as with De Moivre, Laplace's finding received little attention in his own time. It was not until the nineteenth century was at an end that the importance of the central limit theorem was discerned, when, in 1901, Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov defined it in general terms and proved precisely how it worked mathematically. Nowadays, the central limit theorem is considered to be the unofficial sovereign of probability theory.
Sir Francis Galton described the Central Limit Theorem as:Galton F. 1889 Natural Inheritance , http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/books/natural-inheritance/pages/natural-inheritance_0073.htm p. 66
quote I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the Law of Frequency of Error. The law would have been personified by the Greeks and deified, if they had known of it. It reigns with serenity and in complete self-effacement, amidst the wildest confusion. The huger the mob, and the greater the apparent anarchy, the more perfect is its sway. It is the supreme law of Unreason. Whenever a large sample of chaotic elements are taken in hand and marshaled in the order of their magnitude, an unsuspected and most beautiful form of regularity proves to have been latent all along.
The actual term central limit theorem in German: zentraler Grenzwertsatz was first used by George Plya in 1920 in the title of a paper.Citation last=Plya first=George authorlink=George Plya year=1920 title=ber den zentralen Grenzwertsatz der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und das Momentenproblem journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift volume=8 pages=171181 language=German url=http://www-gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/cgi-bin/digbib.cgi?PPN266833020_0008 doi=10.1007/BF01206525 issue=34 Plya referred to the theorem as central due to its importance in probability theory. According to Le Cam, the French school of probability interprets the word central in the sense that it describes the behaviour of the centre of the distribution as opposed to its tails. The abstract of the paper On the central limit theorem of calculus of probability and the problem of moments by Plya in 1920 translates as follows.
quote text=The occurrence of the Gaussian probability density 1 = e'x2 in repeated experiments, in errors of measurements, which result in the combination of very many and very small elementary errors, in diffusion processes etc., can be explained, as is well-known, by the very same limit theorem, which plays a central role in the calculus of probability. The actual discoverer of this limit theorem is to be named Laplace; it is likely that its rigorous proof was first given by Tschebyscheff and its sharpest formulation can be found, as far as I am aware of, in an article by Liapounoff. ... 
A thorough account of the theorem's history, detailing Laplace's foundational work, as well as Augustin Louis Cauchy Cauchy's, Friedrich Bessel Bessel's and Simon Denis Poisson Poisson's contributions, is provided by Hald. Two historical accounts, one covering the development from Laplace to Cauchy, the second the contributions by Richard von Mises von Mises, George Plya Plya, Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg Lindeberg, Paul Lvy mathematician Lvy, and Harald Cramr Cramr during the 1920s, are given by Hans Fischer. Le Cam describes a period  around 1935. Bernstein presents a historical discussion focusing on the work of Pafnuty Chebyshev and his students Andrey Markov and Aleksandr Lyapunov that led to the first proofs of the CLT in a general setting.
A curious footnote to the history of the Central Limit Theorem is that a proof of a result similar to the 1922 Lindeberg CLT was the subject of Alan Turing's 1934 Fellowship Dissertation for King's College, Cambridge King's College at the University of Cambridge.  Only after submitting the work did Turing learn it had already been proved.  Consequently, Turing's dissertation was never published.Hodges, Andrew 1983 Alan Turing: the enigma.
