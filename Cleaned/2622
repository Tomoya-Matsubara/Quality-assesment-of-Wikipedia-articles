'''Contrareloj is the second album of Enanitos Verdes published on 1986.
Originally released in 1986, Contra Reloj was Los Enanitos Verdes sophomore effort but the first that the group recorded for CBS (now Sony). Produced by Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Calamaro, the album is a good collection of simple pop/rock songs and probably one of the strongest albums that the band has ever recorded. It's like a greatest-hits collection in itself: &quot;La Muralla Verde,&quot; &quot;Conciencia Contra Reloj,&quot; &quot;Cada Vez Que Digo Adi&lt;U+00F3&gt;s,&quot; and &quot;Simulacro de Tensi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n&quot; were massive hits at the time and still are covered by the band in its shows.
Track listing
La muralla verde
Conciencia contrarreloj
Cada vez que digo adi&lt;U+00F3&gt;s
Tus viejas cartas
La luz del r&lt;U+00ED&gt;o
Simulacro de tensi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n
S&lt;U+00F3&gt;lo dame otra oportunidad
Luchas de poder
Es una m&lt;U+00E1&gt;quina
Algo termin&lt;U+00F3&gt; mal
