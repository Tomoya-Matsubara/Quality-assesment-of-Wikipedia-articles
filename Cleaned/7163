The shooting of Michael Brown occurred on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, United States. Brown was an unarmed, 18-year-old African-American male who was shot multiple times by an unnamed Ferguson police officer.1 The incident sparked protests and acts of vandalism in the St. Louis suburb, as well as national calls for an investigation.2
Brown, who had recently graduated from high school, was days away from starting college3 and had no criminal record.4
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a civil rights investigation of the shooting on August 11, and the next day U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement expressing condolences to Brown's family, also committing federal resources to conduct an investigation.
Shooting
The incident began around 2:00 p.m. on August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, when Michael Brown, 18, and Dorian Johnson, 22, both African American men, were walking to Brown's grandmother's house.56 A Ferguson police officer drove up to the two men shortly after 2:00 p.m. and ordered them off of the street and onto the sidewalk. After a gunshot was fired either in or from within the vehicle, Brown and Johnson then began to flee. The officer pursued the two men, then fired an as-of-yet unspecified number of shots, fatally wounding Brown. Brown's body was approximately  away from the cruiser when he died,7 and his body was not removed from the scene for an extended period of time. Johnson was not injured in the event. The Ferguson City Police Department has, as of August 13, 2014, declined to identify the officer involved in the shooting; he is currently on administrative leave.8
St. Louis County Police account of events
In a news conference held the day after the shooting, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar stated, &quot;The genesis of this was a physical confrontation...,&quot; during which Brown &quot;physically assaulted the police officer.&quot;9 According to Belmar, the officer tried to exit his vehicle when Brown pushed him back into the car and allegedly assaulted the officer inside the car. Belmar also stated that Brown attempted to seize the officer's gun. According to Belmar, during the struggle in the vehicle, at least one shot was fired. Police acknowledge that &quot;more than a couple&quot; of shots were fired, in the course of the encounter. 101112
Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson has since stated that the officer who shot Brown was injured in the incident.13
According to the Ferguson Police Department, dashboard cameras are not used in Ferguson police cars.14
Other eyewitness accounts of events
Dorian Johnson's account
According to Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown at the time, the police officer pulled up beside them in his police cruiser and said, &quot;Get the fuck on the sidewalk.&quot;1516171819 The young men replied that they were &quot;not but a minute away from [their] destination, and we would shortly be out of the street,&quot; Johnson said.
According to Johnson's account, the officer drove a short distance forward, stopped and then backed up, almost hitting the pair. Johnson recalled, &quot;We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer.&quot; The officer, still in his car, grabbed Brown through the door by his neck. Brown tried to pull away, but the officer kept pulling Brown toward him. The officer drew his weapon, and &quot;he said, 'I'll shoot you' or 'I'm going to shoot' &quot; and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown.
Johnson told Chris Hayes of MSNBC that the claim by the St. Louis County Police that that Brown went for the officer's gun is wrong, that Brown &quot;did not reach for the officer's weapon at all.&quot;2021222324
The men ran, and then the officer shot Brown in the back. Brown turned, holding his hands in the air and said &quot;I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!&quot; The officer then shot him several more times.2526
Multiple witnesses corroborate various elements of Johnson's account, denying, for example that Brown reached for the officer's gun, and supporting the claim that after being hit in the back while fleeing, Brown put his hands in the air to make clear that he had no weapon and as a gesture of surrender.
Tiffany Mitchell's account
Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, whose upper-level apartment is directly adjacent to the location of the shooting, said she heard the sound of tires screeching and came out of her apartment to see what was going on. Mitchell said she witnessed the altercation between the police officer and Brown virtually from its inception. She stated that she was watching as the first gun shot was fired while the police officer, but not Brown, was still in the vehicle, at which point she went back into her apartment to get her cell phone in order to make a video recording of the unfolding event.27
Excerpts of Mitchell's video recording are shown in a report by St. Louis CBS television affiliate KMOV, as part of a broadcast interview the station did with Mitchell. Mitchell's video shows both Brown's dead body and the police vehicle, positioned at about the distance estimated by the police during their Sunday press conference. In the video, the empty vehicle is positioned diagonally across one lane of the two-lane road.28
In an interview with St. Louis CBS television affiliate KMOV, Mitchell stated that &quot;After the shot, the kid just breaks away. The cop follows him, kept shooting, the kid's body jerked as if he was hit. After his body jerked he turns around, puts his hands up, and the cop continues to walk up on him and continues to shoot until he goes all the way down.&quot;29
Piaget Crenshaw's account
One witness, Piaget Crenshaw, stated it looked like the police officer and Brown were &quot;arm wrestling&quot;&quot; before the officer initial shot Brown. Then the officer chased Brown for about 20 feet before shooting him again. When Brown then raised his arms in compliance, the officer shot him two more times.303132
Investigations
On August 10, Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, announced that their department would be in charge of the investigation, after receiving a request from Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson to investigate the shooting.3334 When the investigation is complete, the St. Louis County police will turn over the case to St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch, who will determine whether or not charges need to be filed.35
The Ferguson Police department declined to name the officer involved in the shooting, citing concerns for his safety and refused to commit to a deadline for releasing a full autopsy report.36 On August 11, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a parallel civil rights investigation into the incident,37 and Attorney General Eric Holder instructed the Justice Department staff to monitor the developments.38

A hacktivist group claiming an association with Anonymous and operating under the codename &quot;Operation Ferguson&quot; organized cyberprotests by setting up a web site and a Twitter account.48 The group promised that if any protesters were harassed or harmed, they would attack the city's servers and computers, taking them offline.49 City officials said that e-mail systems were targeted and phones died, while the Internet crashed at the City Hall.5051 Members of Anonymous corresponding with Mother Jones said that they are working on confirming the identity of the police officer who shot Brown and will release his name as soon as they do.52 On August 14, Anonymous posted on its Twitter feed what it claims is the name of the officer involved in the shooting.5354

Between August 12 and 13, police officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at lines of protesters and reporters. At least seven protesters were arrested on the evening of August 12 and 13, after police told protesters to &quot;'go home' or face arrest.&quot;57
Reporters Wesley Lowery and Ryan Reilley, of The Washington Post and The Huffington Post, respectively, were arrested by police on August 13, while attempting to use a local McDonald's restaurant's Internet service to report on the incidents.58 Martin Baron, Executive Editor of The Washington Post, issued a statement saying &quot;there was absolutely no justification for [Wesley Lowery's] arrest&quot; and that the police's behavior &quot;was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news.&quot;59 On the night of August 13&lt;U+2013&gt;14, Antonio French, an alderman from the 21st ward of St. Louis, was also arrested by police.6061
Protests
On August 10, a day of vigils began peacefully, but some crowd members started to behave in an unruly manner after the candlelight vigil.62 Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear.63 The crowd then began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles and confronting police who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.64 At least 12 businesses were looted or vandalized, a gas station was set on fire, and police arrested over 30 people afterwards. Many windows were broken and several nearby businesses closed on Monday.65 The people arrested face charges of assault, burglary and theft. Police used a variety of equipment, including riot gear and helicopters, to disperse the crowd by 2 a.m.66 Two police officers suffered minor injuries during the events.67
On August 11, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse a crowd at the shell of the QuikTrip68 convenience store burnt out the night before. According to reports, gunshots were fired in Ferguson and five people were arrested.6970
On August 12, several hundred protestors gathered in Clayton, the county seat seeking criminal prosecution of the officer involved in the shooting.71 Protestors in Ferguson carried signs and many held their hands in the air while shouting &quot;don't shoot&quot;. According to police, some protestors threw bottles at the officers, prompting the use of tear gas to disperse the crowd.72 The following day, a heavily-armed SWAT team of around 70 officers arrived at a protest demanding that protesters disperse.73 On the night of August 13, some people threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at police who responded with smoke bombs, flash grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Video footage of the events recorded by KARG Argus Radio shows Ferguson Police firing tear gas into a residential neighborhood and ordering the journalist to cease recording.747576
According to The Washington Post, the Ferguson Police Department &quot;bears little demographic resemblance&quot; to the mostly African-American community, which already harbored &quot;suspicions of the law enforcement agency&quot; preceding Brown's shooting. An annual report last year by the office of Missouri's attorney general concluded that Ferguson police were &quot;twice as likely to arrest African Americans during traffic stops as they were whites.&quot;77
