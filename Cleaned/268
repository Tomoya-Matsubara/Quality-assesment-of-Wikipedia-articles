His elder brother, John, was the 10th Duke of Marlborough. His stepmother was the former Gladys Deacon, and his stepfather was Col. Jacques Balsan.
Spencer-Churchill was educated at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford before joining the Royal Army Service Corps in 1917 and gaining the rank of lieutenant. He fought in the First World War and was decorated with the French Legion of Honour.
A conveyance dated 26 September 1930 documents the purchase of three parcels of land and premises known as Springhead situated along Mill Street at Fontmell Magna in the county of Dorset.1 Another conveyance dated 8 November 1934 documents Lord Ivor Churchill selling one of these parcels (31 Mill Street, a semi-detached cottage) to Henry Rolf Gardener (see Rolf Gardiner.) 2
He married Elizabeth Cunningham on 15 November 1947 and had a son, Robert William Charles (born 1954).
He developed an inoperable brain tumor and died in September 1956. He is buried beside his cousin, Sir Winston Churchill, and close to his mother at St Martin's Church, Bladon, near Woodstock, Oxfordshire.
