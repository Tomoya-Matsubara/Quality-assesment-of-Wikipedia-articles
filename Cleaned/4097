Phillip (Phil) John Lamason DFC &amp; Bar was an officer of the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) during the Second World War who rose to prominence as the senior officer in charge of 168 allied airmen taken to Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany, in August 1944.1
Early life and RNZAF career
Lamason was born in Napier on 15 September 1918, but was raised in Dannevirke, a small rural community in New Zealand's North Island.2 Prior to the war, Lamason worked for the Department of Agriculture as a stock inspector. He was described as a tall, good looking man with blue eyes.34
Lamason joined the RNZAF in September 1940 and by April 1942, he was a pilot officer in No. 218 Squadron RAF. During a bombing raid on Pilsen, the aircraft he was captaining was attacked by an enemy fighter and badly damaged, but managed to return to base. As a result of his actions, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 15 May 1942. The full citation read:
On 2 June 1943, he was Mentioned in Despatches,5 and, having received promotion to acting squadron leader, he was again Mentioned on 14 January 1944.6 He was awarded a Bar to his DFC on 27 June 1944.7
Buchenwald
On 8 June 1944, Lamason was serving as a flight commander in a Lancaster of No. 15 Squadron RAF, when he was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards near Paris.8 Lamason recalled: 
Lamason (centre) and another airman playing chess in Chevreuse with a Frenchwoman whose family hid them for two weeks after they were shot down.
Lamason was hidden by the French Resistance for seven weeks before being captured by the Gestapo in August after he was betrayed by the French double agent Jacques Desoubrie.9 Many fliers were classified as &quot;Terrorflieger&quot; (terror flier) by the Germans, and were not given a trial. The German Foreign Office decided that captured enemy airmen should not be given the legal status of prisoner of war (POWs) but should instead be treated as criminals and spies.1011 Consequently, Lamason was amongst 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand,12 who were taken by train from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald concentration camp and arrived there on 20 August 1944.131415
Buchenwald was a labor camp of about 60,000 inmates of mainly Russian POWs, but also common criminals, religious prisoners (including Jews), and various political prisoners from Germany, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.16 Upon arrival, Lamason, as ranking officer, demanded an interview with the commandant, which he was granted. He insisted that the airmen be treated as POWs under the Geneva Conventions and be sent to a POW camp. The commandant agreed that their arrival at Buchenwald was a &quot;mistake&quot; but they remained there anyway.17 The airmen were given the same poor treatment and beatings as the other inmates.18 For the first three weeks at Buchenwald, the prisoners were totally shaven, denied shoes and forced to sleep outside without shelter.19
After their first meal, Lamason stepped forward and stated:

82 American
48 British
26 Canadian
9 Australian
2 New Zealander
1 Jamaican
Lamason proceeded to organise the airmen into groups by nationality and appointed a Commanding Officer within each group. Lamason did not do this just to improve their morale but because he also saw it as his responsibility to carry on his war duties despite the adverse circumstances.22 Lamason's leadership boosted the airmen's spirits and gave them hope while instilling a level of discipline and bearing.2324 One of the first assignments Lamason gave was to mount a guard detail, both day and night, to prevent pilfering by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp.25
For the next six weeks, Lamason negotiated with the German camp authorities, but his requests to have the airmen transferred to proper POW camps were denied.2627 One captured British airman, Pilot Officer S.A. Spierenburg, was a Dutchman flying for the Royal Air Force.2829 Spierenburg, who spoke fluent German, regularly acted as an interpretor for Lamason when he negotiated with the camp authorities.30
Most airmen doubted they would ever get out of Buchenwald because their documents were stamped with the acronym &quot;DIKAL&quot; (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or &quot;not to be transferred to another camp&quot;.3132 At great risk, Lamason secretly got word out to the German Luftwaffe of their captivity at the camp.3334 Lamason understood that the Luftwaffe would be sympathetic to their predicament, as they would not want their captured men treated in the same way; he also knew that the Luftwaffe had the political connections to get the airmen transferred to a POW camp.3536 Eventually, his persistence paid off and on the night of 19 October, 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.3738 Unknown to all except Lamason, their execution had been scheduled for 26 October, had they remained at Buchenwald.394041 The twelve remaining POWs were too sick to travel and remained at Buchenwald. Two subsequently died from sickness and the other ten were transported to Stalag Luft III several days later.42 In late January 1945, all Stalag Luft III POWs were forced marched to Luckenwalde, where they remained until liberated by the Russian army at the end of the war in Europe.4344
Many airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason.4546 Captured pilot, Stratton Appleman, stated that &quot;they were very fortunate to have Lamason as their leader&quot;.47 Another airman, Joe Moser, stated that Lamason was a great leader who he would have been glad to follow anywhere he asked.48
Aftermath
Following their liberation and return to England, Lamason was asked to consider commanding one of the Okinawa squadrons for the final attack on Japan. However, the RNZAF refused and Lamason returned to New Zealand, arriving there the day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.49 After the war, Lamason was discharged from the air force on 16 December 1945.50 He returned to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. In April 2005, Lamason, then 86, recollected the events of Buchenwald on TV New Zealand.51
