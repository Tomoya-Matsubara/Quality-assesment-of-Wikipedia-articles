Oliver Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; (Serbian Cyrillic: &lt;U+041E&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt; &lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+045B&gt;; born July 13, 1953 in Titovo U&lt;U+017E&gt;ice, Serbia, Yugoslavia) is a Serbian pop musician, composer, and producer - very prominent and popular throughout the 1980s.
Early biography
Musically involved from a young age, he first started playing the accordion before taking up the piano. In his early youth, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s family moved to the capital Belgrade where he pursued a career of a pianist after getting accepted at highly reputable Kornelije Stankovi&lt;U+0107&gt; musical high school. However, despite a lot of promise, he left school in 1969 to try to branch out into pop music.
Early career
Towards the end of 1971 he started playing in a jazz-rock band Oliver with members of Pop Ma&lt;U+0161&gt;ina along with Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an Prelevi&lt;U+0107&gt; on vocal. The group performed only once - January 2, 1972 at Hala sportova. Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; then played with Pop Ma&lt;U+0161&gt;ina several times, and was in talks to join YU grupa and Time, but neither transfer took place. Around the same time, he took part in his first studio recording (made with Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an Prelevi&lt;U+0107&gt;): single &quot;Tajna&quot; / &quot;Pro&lt;U+0161&gt;lo je sve&quot;.
Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s next notable outing came during the 1976 BOOM festival at Ta&lt;U+0161&gt;majdan Stadium where he led the especially assembled group called Oliverova Beogradska Reprezentacija. The ad-hoc band included some notable musicians of the time: bassist Robert Neme&lt;U+010D&gt;ek, guitarist Zoran Bo&lt;U+017E&gt;inovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, drummer Lazar To&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;, trumpet player Stjepko Gut, and saxophonists Jovan Maljokovi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Ivan &lt;U+0160&gt;vager. That gig brought Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; his first eccentric episode in public, something he would become known for later on, as he smashed his synthesizer on stage and walked out in the middle of performing unhappy with the level of commitment his fellow musicians were putting forth.
Solo career
1970s
Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s solo performing career began almost by chance in 1978 with &quot;Ljuljaj me ne&lt;U+017E&gt;no&quot; single. He composed that song, with text supplied by Marina Tucakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, for singer Maja Od&lt;U+017E&gt;aklijevska, but since she failed to show up in Split studio Tetrapak for a booked recording session, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; was persuaded by producer Enco Lesi&lt;U+0107&gt; to record it himself. The material was released the same year as a 2-side single &quot;Ljuljaj me ne&lt;U+017E&gt;no&quot; / &quot;&lt;U+0160&gt;uma&quot; by PGP-RTB, garnering positive reactions both commercially and critically. A year later, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; put out another successful single release with &quot;Sutra imam prazan stan&quot; and effective ballad &quot;Osloni se na mene&quot;, cementing his place on the scene.
Zdravko &lt;U+010C&gt;oli&lt;U+0107&gt; came calling next, inviting Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; as guest on his country-wide tour that included stadiums and sports arenas. Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s part in the show consisted of coming out in the middle of &lt;U+010C&gt;oli&lt;U+0107&gt;'s performance and doing only &quot;Ljuljaj me ne&lt;U+017E&gt;no&quot;, which had by that time become a sizable hit.
In 1979 he wrote and recorded a track &quot;Cve&lt;U+0107&gt;ke i zlo&lt;U+0107&gt;e&quot;, which was included in Goran Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s movie Nacionalna klasa.
1980s
Probaj me
Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; then took some time off to concentrate on his debut album Probaj me (Try Me) which came out in 1980, featuring hit &quot;Samo nebo zna (Polude&lt;U+0107&gt;u)&quot; and a re-recorded &quot;Osloni se na mene&quot;. The record was promoted somewhat unconventionally - through TV show Beograd no&lt;U+0107&gt;u (Belgrade by Night) directed by Stanko Crnobrnja. The ambitiously avantgarde programme even won Rose d'Or award at the 1981 Montreux TV festival. Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s controversial image on the show, created by conceptual artist Kosta Bunu&lt;U+0161&gt;evac, raised quite a public furor due to the singer's cross-dressing and aggressive makeup. It was noted at the time that a viewer from Zemun smashed his TV set at the sight of Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; in high heels and tight mini-skirt.1
Zbog tebe bih tucao kamen
In 1982, second album Zbog tebe bih tucao kamen (I Would Break Rocks for You) came out, delivering a new batch of hits: &quot;Smejem se, a plakao bih&quot;, &quot;Neverne bebe&quot;, and controversial disco track &quot;Sve su seke jebene&quot; (using motives from Crven ban, book of erotic folk poetry collected by Vuk Stefanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; Karad&lt;U+017E&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt;). Recorded in Switzerland and produced by Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Peter Taggart, the album featured Nenad Stefanovi&lt;U+0107&gt; on bass, &lt;U+0110&gt;i&lt;U+0111&gt;i Jankeli&lt;U+0107&gt; on drums, Sr&lt;U+0111&gt;an Miodragovi&lt;U+0107&gt; on guitar, Laza Ristovski on organ, Mi&lt;U+0107&gt;a Markovi&lt;U+0107&gt; on saxophone, Stjepko Gut on trumpet, while Bebi Dol provided the backing vocals. In addition to singing, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; played the acoustic and electric piano.
In the mid-1980s Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; incorporated slight folk music elements into his sound. In late 1984 he won top prize at the inaugural MESAM festival with the folkish sounding &quot;Pitaju me pitaju, oko moje&quot; written by Marina Tucakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;.
Do&lt;U+0111&gt;e mi da vrisnem tvoje ime
Next year, in 1985, he triumphed at the same festival again with another folkish track &quot;Pomagajte drugovi&quot;. He used the widely publicized festival appearance to promote his third album Do&lt;U+0111&gt;e mi da vrisnem tvoje ime (I Feel like Screaming Your Name), produced again by Peter Taggart. In addition to the title track, the album brought further hits that flirt with folk. The same year also saw him take part in YU Rock Misija, Yugoslav contribution to Bob Geldof's Band Aid.
For all intents and purposes, this is when Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s solo recording career ended, at least in the classic album-tour-album sense, as he began keeping a noticeably lower profile on the pop scene. He got an executive job at the PGP-RTB record label, where he stayed for most of 1986 and 1987, before releasing a greatest hits compilation Sve najbolje (All the Best) that marked the 10th anniversary of his solo career. The same year, 1987, saw Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; team up with Nik&lt;U+0161&gt;a Brato&lt;U+0161&gt; to produce Boris Novkovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s second album Ja&lt;U+010D&gt;i od sudbine, which sold very well. Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; also received an offer to produce Plavi Orkestar's second album Smrt fa&lt;U+0161&gt;izmu, but turned it down.
For the remainder of the decade Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; recorded an album of children's music Deca bez adrese (Children without an Address) with popular children's entertainer and TV personality Branko Kockica, and in 1989 he again collaborated with his old friend Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an Prelevi&lt;U+0107&gt; who wrote a screenplay for the movie Poslednji krug u Monci. Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; recorded the movie's title track &quot;Odlazim, a volim te&quot;, which became a sizable commercial hit. The song, along with some other material that Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; used in the movie, all came from the recordings he made with different musicians such as Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny while staying in the United States during the late 1980s.
1990s and 2000s
The beginning of the new decade saw Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; appear with Marina Perazi&lt;U+0107&gt; on the Jugoton-released 12-track various artists collection of duets called 12 popularnih dueta - udvoje je najljep&lt;U+0161&gt;e. Their track, recorded some years earlier (1984.), was &quot;Mandarina i banana&quot;.
Around a year later, towards the end of 1991, he took part in an interesting project - becoming in essence an extended member of hard rock band Riblja &lt;U+010C&gt;orba. The idea was to include Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; in the creative process of the band's planned farewell album Labudova pesma by having him write and compose half of the songs, and later, upon its release, tour as their keyboards player. The material was recorded in Vienna, but as it was being prepared for wide release a huge row erupted between Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; and band leader Bora &lt;U+0110&gt;or&lt;U+0111&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;. As a result, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; demanded that all his tracks be removed, and even obtained a court-ordered junction prohibiting their release. In the end, the album's released version contained only eight tracks - half of the originally planned number, and it also ended up not being Riblja &lt;U+010D&gt;orba's last as they soon changed their minds, deciding to continue playing and recording. On the other hand, raw studio versions of Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s unreleased tracks have since then become rare and valuable collecter's items.
Over the next period Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; placed music on the back-burner completely, choosing to live off releasing greatest hits compilations. First Smejem se a plakao bih (I'm Laughing but I Feel like Crying) in 1993 which sold surprisingly well in the hyperinflation-ridden FR Yugoslavia, followed by The Best of in 1994, which included the previously never officially released, although already widely played hit track &quot;Odlazim, a volim te&quot;.
He then composed a couple of songs for his friend Serbian paramilitary &lt;U+017D&gt;eljko Ra&lt;U+017E&gt;natovi&lt;U+0107&gt; Arkan's new girlfriend and later bride Svetlana &quot;Ceca&quot; Veli&lt;U+010D&gt;kovi&lt;U+0107&gt;, including the Marina Tucakovi&lt;U+0107&gt;-written &quot;Lavlje srce&quot;, and even appeared as guest at her Pionir Hall concert in 1994 along with Knez, &lt;U+017D&gt;eljko &lt;U+0160&gt;a&lt;U+0161&gt;i&lt;U+0107&gt; and Mira &lt;U+0160&gt;kori&lt;U+0107&gt;.
In 1997 Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; finally ventured back into music, recording the album Kad ljubav ubije. In addition to the material he recorded in the United States during his late-1980s stay, it featured fresh music with Freddie Hubbard, Vlatko Stefanovski, Bebi Dol, and Radomir Mihailovi&lt;U+0107&gt; To&lt;U+010D&gt;ak among the guests. However, the material was never released due to never fully explained reasons. Initially, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; was not satisfied with the financial terms and promotional commitment record companies were offering, but after some time the whole thing fell into oblivion and the material is still unreleased. The material is currently owned by Maksa &lt;U+0106&gt;atovi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s Komuna record label, and in early 2008 he indicated that they might release it.2
Coming years brought more musical inactivity for Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;, only briefly interrupted in 2002 when City Records decided to re-release the 1994's Best Of compilation with a bonus track - previously unheard and unreleased &quot;Ako la&lt;U+017E&gt;em tu me seci&quot;. After almost fifteen years, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; even shot a video to accompany the song, appearing in traditional Serbian attire with Ksenija Paj&lt;U+010D&gt;in as dancing eye candy.
In early 2006 Banca Intesa's Serbian subsidiary used his song &quot;Osloni se na mene&quot; in a series of TV spots as part of their credit loan marketing campaign.
In early 2008, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; made another partial comeback with a song &quot;Vreme za ljubav isti&lt;U+010D&gt;e&quot; featuring Svetlana &quot;Ceca&quot; Ra&lt;U+017E&gt;natovi&lt;U+0107&gt;. The song was already recorded during the 1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1996 period for Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s eventually unreleased album Kad ljubav ubije. For his latest comeback, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; originally wanted to come up with a brand new song, but in the end decided to use the updated version of the unreleased track - the only difference being that Ceca now appears in the re-recorded chorus line. Promoting the release of &quot;Vreme za ljubav isti&lt;U+010D&gt;e&quot; on January 24, 2008 in Belgrade's Ruski car restaurant, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; made it clear that this does not mean he is returning to a full singing career that ended in 1985. Among other things he also touched on the unreleased album: &quot;I've got people like Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Freddie Hubbard, and Michael Baker playing on that album - the absolute cream of the crop in the world of jazz - however I can't make any dough with them. The only person I can do that with is Ceca&quot;.3
Personal life, public image and controversy
Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s outrageous transvestite image, which the Yugoslav audience found especially shocking in the early 1980s, attracted considerable media scrutiny.4 Rumours of homosexuality persisted early in his career, followed by reports of heavy drug use.
He also holds a longstanding reputation of being difficult and fussy to work with. His various in-studio and on-stage temper tantrums are well documented, painting him as an arrogant perfectionist.
He occasionally gave outspoken and opinionated interviews in which he viciously went after certain fellow performers whose abilities and music he considered substandard. Some of his favourite targets in the 1980s included Sarajevo populist pop/rock bands such as Merlin, Hari Mata Hari, Crvena Jabuka and Plavi Orkestar, which he collectively referred to as abortus rock.5 He also frequently called out Goran Bregovi&lt;U+0107&gt; for his complete lack of formal musical education and a practice of &quot;borrowing/stealing and re-arranging riffs and bars from foreign hits&quot;. On the other hand Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; often praised the work of Korni Grupa, Josipa Lisac, Indexi, Time, and even Zdravko &lt;U+010C&gt;oli&lt;U+0107&gt;.
In the early 1990s, he became involved with Serbian paramilitary &lt;U+017D&gt;eljko Ra&lt;U+017E&gt;natovi&lt;U+0107&gt; Arkan whom he knew since childhood. Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; was often seen wearing the Serbian Volunteer Guard uniform around Belgrade and even made a couple of trips to the front-lines in Slavonia where according to most accounts his role was distributing food and cigarettes in the Guard's Erdut headquarters.6
In the mid-1990s Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; moved to his cottage in the village of Zaovine in the Tara Mountain. For a while he entertained the idea of building a theme park named Oliwood there, but soon abandoned it due to lack of funds.
Since the late 1990s Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; has been active as a club owner and restaurateur. He still owns multiple nightspots in downtown Belgrade including a cafe named Jazz on Obili&lt;U+0107&gt;ev Venac Street, as well as Ku&lt;U+0107&gt;a umetnosti club on Zmaja od No&lt;U+0107&gt;aja Street.
During mid 2000s, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt; was mentioned in several reports in the Serbian tabloids. In one of them his neighbours at the Zaovine village accused him of arrogant, borderline psychopathic behavior, including shooting their sheep with a rifle.7 Another described him as being fond of masked orgies.8
On December 27, 2010, Mandi&lt;U+0107&gt;'s partner Maja Kozlica gave birth to their baby daughter.9
