Johanna &quot;Anne&quot; Mansfield Sullivan Macy (1866 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1936), also known as Annie Sullivan, was an American teacher best known as the instructor and companion of Helen Keller.1
Early life
Sullivan was born on April 14, 1866 in Feeding Hills, Massachusetts. When Anne was six her mother, Alice, died; later when she was eight her father, Thomas, left, after which Anne was sent to an almshouse. In 1880, Anne, who was nearly blind from untreated trachoma, was sent to the Perkins School for the Blind. Anne had a brother, Jimmie,2 and a sister, Mary.
Career
Michael Anaganos, director of the Institute, then located in South Boston, was approached to suggest a teacher for the Keller's deafblind daughter. He asked Anne Sullivan, a former student, herself visually impaired and only 20 years old, to become Helen's instructor. It was the beginning of a 49-year relationship, Sullivan evolving into governess and then eventual companion.
Anne Sullivan arrived at Keller's house in March 1887, and immediately began to teach Helen to communicate by spelling words into her hand, beginning with &quot;d-o-l-l&quot; for the doll that she had brought Keller as a present. Keller was frustrated, at first, because she did not understand that every object had a word uniquely identifying it. In fact, when Sullivan was trying to teach Keller the word for &quot;mug&quot;, Keller became so frustrated she broke the doll.3 Keller's big breakthrough in communication came the next month, when she realized that the motions her teacher was making on the palm of her hand, while running cool water over her other hand, symbolized the idea of &quot;water&quot;; she then nearly exhausted Sullivan demanding the names of all the other familiar objects in her world.
As lifelong companions Sullivan and Keller continually lived, worked, and traveled together.
Personal life
On May 2 or May 9, 1905, Sullivan married a Harvard University instructor and literary critic, John Albert Macy (1877&lt;U+2013&gt;1932), who had helped Keller with her publications. The three lived together. However, within a few years, their marriage began to disintegrate. By 1914 they had separated, they never officially divorced. In the early years after their separation, John wrote and asked for money.
In the 1920 census, Helen Keller was 38 years old and listed as head of her household in the Queens, New York Census. Anne is listed as living with her, age 52, listed as a private teacher of Helen. John Macy is also listed as living with them (entered as a Lodger, writer/author, age 44). As the years progressed Macy appears to have faded from Sullivan's life. Helen never married.
Awards
In 1932 they were each awarded honorary fellowships from the Educational Institute of Scotland. They also were awarded honorary degrees from Temple University.4
Death
By 1935, Sullivan became completely blind just one year before her death on October 20, 1936 in Forest Hills, New York. She died after a coma at age 70, with Keller holding her hand.5 When Keller herself died in 1968, her ashes were placed in the Washington National Cathedral next to Anne's.
