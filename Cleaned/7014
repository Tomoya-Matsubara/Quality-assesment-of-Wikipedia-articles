Prospekt's March is an EP by English alternative rock band Coldplay, initially released on 21 November 2008 in Europe and Japan, and worldwide the following week.12 It features several tracks left over from the studio sessions for Coldplay's fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends.34 It is also available in the deluxe edition of Viva la Vida.5
The cover features Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Delacroix's original painting6 Battle of Poitiers,7 similar to the cover art featured on Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (which included another Delacroix-created painting). On 5 November, Coldplay offered an exclusive preview of the EP via their Facebook application8 and through their website.9
There were two singles that anchored the EP. The song &quot;Glass of Water&quot; entered the iTunes Top 100 songs and went on to be performed live by the band on 4Music. &quot;Life in Technicolor II&quot; began its existence in the charts at #90 in the UK Singles Chart despite not being released as an official single. It was later confirmed to be the EP's first single.10 It later peaked at #28 upon its physical release on 8 February 2009. The song was nominated at the 52nd Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Best Short Form Music Video.11
As of January 2010, Prospekt's March has sold 537,000 copies worldwide.12
Recording and release
Throughout the recording of Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, Coldplay communicated to fans through their website, some of the songs names were revealed during the recording. The name &quot;Poppyfields&quot; was first revealed in September 2007, in late October 2007, a message said that &quot;Famous Old Painters&quot; and &quot;Glass of Water&quot;, had been written and were being considered for the album, &quot;Prospekt's March&quot; appeared for the first time in December of the same year, all the notes were signed by the pseudonym Prospekt, strengthening rumours that this would be the album's title. But those songs never made to the album's final tracklisting, so were featured on the Prospekt's March EP, except for Famous Old Painters that was never released.
In an interview for Coldplay's official website Chris Martin said that all the songs on the EP came very close to be on Viva la Vida, and that they were &quot;all part of the same family&quot;. On the same interview the frontman stated that the idea was always to put these songs out by the end of 2008.13
Track listing
