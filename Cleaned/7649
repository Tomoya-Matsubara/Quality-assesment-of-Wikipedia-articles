  Alice Springs is a town in the Northern Territory of Australia. Alice Springs (23.8S, 133.89E) has a population of 26,486 (in 2005[http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/ Australian
Bureau of Statistics] Retrieved on 25 September 2006 ). The town is 576 metres above sea level in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is the second largest centre in the Northern Territory and is popularly known as &quot;the Alice&quot; or simply &quot;Alice.&lt;U+201D&gt; The town is 200 km south of the absolute centre of Australia and nearly equidistant from Adelaide and Darwin, Alice Springs is known as Mparntwe to its traditional inhabitants, the Arrernte, who have lived in the Central Australian desert in and around Alice Springs for more than 50,000 years.
Alice Springs is best-known outside the region from the title of the Nevil Shute novel A Town Like Alice, even though little of the story takes place in Alice Springs, and because of its proximity to Uluru (Ayers Rock), the monolithic rock that is one of Australia's best-known natural landmarks and an important focus of Aboriginal culture.
History
Early city
 In 1862, John McDouall Stuart led an expedition into Central Australia and the area where Alice Springs is located. Until the 1930s, however, the town was known as Stuart. The Overland Telegraph Line linking Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain was completed in 1872. It traced Stuart&lt;U+2019&gt;s route and opened up the interior for permanent settlement. It wasn&lt;U+2019&gt;t until alluvial gold was discovered at Arltunga, 100 km east of Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant settlement occurred.

Precinct]]
The telegraph station was sited near what was thought to be a permanent waterhole in the normally dry Todd River and was optimistically named Alice Springs after the wife of the former Postmaster General of South Australia, Sir Charles Todd. The Todd River was named after Sir Charles himself. The original mode of transportation in the outback were camel trains, operated by immigrants from Pathan tribes in the North-West frontier of the then British India and Pakistan who were misnamed &lt;U+2018&gt;Afghan&lt;U+2019&gt; Camellers.
In 1929 the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway was completed from Darwin as far as Birdum, while the Great Northern Railway had been completed in 1891 from Port Augusta as far as Oodnadatta, South Australia, 700 km south of Alice Springs. The lines wouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t meet until 2003. On February 4, 2004, the first passenger train arrived in Darwin.
During the 1960s it became an important defence location with the development of the U.S/Australian Pine Gap joint defence satellite monitoring base, home to about 700 workers from both countries, but by far the major industry in recent times is tourism. Almost in the exact center of the continent, Alice Springs is some 1200 km from the nearest ocean and 1500 km from the nearest major cities, Darwin and Adelaide. Alice Springs is now the midpoint of the Adelaide&lt;U+2013&gt;Darwin Railway.1
Indigenous history
 The Arrernte Aboriginal people have made their home in the Central Australian desert in and around Alice Springs for more than 50,000 years. The Aboriginal name for Alice Springs is Mparntwe.
According to the Arrernte traditional stories, in the desert surrounding Alice Springs, the landscape was shaped by caterpillars, wild dogs, travelling boys, two sisters, euros and other ancestral figures. There are many sites of traditional importance in and around Alice Springs, such as Anthwerrke (Emily Gap), Akeyulerre (Billy Goat Hill), Ntaripe (Heavitree Gap), Atnelkentyarliweke (Anzac Hill) and Alhekulyele (Mt. Gillen).
Modern city
The modern town of Alice Springs has both western and Aboriginal influences. The town&lt;U+2019&gt;s focal point, the Todd Mall hosts a number of Aboriginal art galleries and community events. Alice Springs&lt;U+2019&gt; desert lifestyle has inspired several unique and interesting events such as the Camel Cup, the Henley on Todd Regatta and the Beanie Festival.
