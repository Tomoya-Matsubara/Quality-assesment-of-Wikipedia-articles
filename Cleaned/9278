Tirpitz was the second of two sclass Bismarck battleships built for the German Kriegsmarine War Navy during World War II. Named after Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the architect of the Imperial German Navy Kaiserliche Marine Imperial Navy, the ship was laid down at the Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven in November 1936 and her Hull watercraft hull was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship German battleship Bismarck Bismarck, Tirpitz was armed with a main battery of eight convert 38 cm adj=on sp=us guns in four twin turrets. After a series of wartime modifications she was convert 2000 MT sp=us heavier than Bismarck.
After completing sea trials in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War Soviet Baltic Fleet. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, Tirpitz was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being, forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.
In September 1943, Tirpitz, along with the battleship German battleship Scharnhorst Scharnhorst, bombarded Allied positions on the island of Spitzbergen, the only time the ship used her main battery :wikt:fire in anger in anger. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in Operation Source an attack by British mini-submarines and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British Avro Lancaster Lancaster bombers equipped with convert 12000 lb Tallboy bombs destroyed the ship; two direct hits and a near miss caused the ship to capsize rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. The wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation after the war from 1948 to 1957.

British bombers repeatedly attacked the harbour in which the ship was being built; no bombs struck Tirpitz, but the attacks did slow construction work.Garzke & Dulin, p. 247 Tirpitz was commissioned into the fleet on 25 February for sea trials,Grner, p. 35 which were conducted in the Baltic.

Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. As built, Tirpitz was equipped with Model 23 search radarsrefn   group = Note   Named FuMO for Funkmessortungsgert Radio direction-finding device.Williamson, p. 42 mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array.

Service history
After sea trials, Tirpitz was stationed in Kiel and performed intensive training in the Baltic. While the ship was in Kiel, Germany Operation Barbarossa invaded the Soviet Union. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible break-out of the Soviet fleet based in Leningrad. Tirpitz was briefly made the flagship of the squadron, which consisted of the heavy cruiser German cruiser Admiral Scheer Admiral Scheer, the light cruisers German cruiser Kln Kln, German cruiser Nrnberg Nrnberg, German cruiser Leipzig Leipzig, and German cruiser Emden Emden, several destroyers, and two flotillas of Minesweeper ship minesweepers. The Baltic Fleet, under the command of Admiral Otto Ciliax, patrolled off the Aaland Islands from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit disbanded and Tirpitz resumed training.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 247248 During the training period, Tirpitz tested her primary and secondary guns on the old pre-dreadnought battleship SMS Hessen  2,Sweetman, p. 11 which had been converted into a radio-controlled target ship.Grner, p. 20 The British Royal Air Force RAF continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on Tirpitz while she was stationed in Kiel.Sweetman, p. 12
Deployment to Norway
File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg thumb Tirpitz camouflaged in the Fttenfjord
Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander of the Kriegsmarine, proposed on 13 November that Tirpitz be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a fleet in being to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of Bismarck, agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the catapult were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.Garzke & Dulin, p. 248 The ship's commander, Kapitn zur See KzS&mdash;Captain at Sea Karl Topp,Williamson, p. 40 pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942. The following day, Tirpitz left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.
The ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for Trondheim. British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the Enigma machine Enigma messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.Sweetman, p. 16 Admiral John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey John Tovey, the commander in chief of the British Home Fleet, was not made aware of Tirpitz's activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.Sweetman, p. 17 On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. Tirpitz then moved to the Fttenfjord, just north of Trondheim.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 248250 The movement was codenamed Operation Polarnacht Polar Night; the battleship was escorted by the destroyers German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen Richard Beitzen, German destroyer Z5 Paul Jakobi Paul Jacobi, German destroyer Z8 Bruno Heinemann Bruno Heinemann and German destroyer Z29 Z-29 for the voyage.Hildebrand, Rhr and Steinmetz, p. 240 She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest. The ship's crew cut down trees and placed them aboard Tirpitz to camouflage her. Additional antiaircraft batteries were installed around the fjord, as were anti-torpedo nets and heavy booms in the entrance to the anchorage.Sweetman, p. 19 Life for the crew of Tirpitz was very monotonous during the deployment to Norway. Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting. The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning antiaircraft defences. Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.Zetterling & Tamelander, p. 207
Operations against Allied convoys
Several factors served to restrain Tirpitz's freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support Operation Cerberus Operation Cerberus, the movement of the battleships German battleship Scharnhorst Scharnhorst and German battleship Gneisenau Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser German cruiser Prinz Eugen Prinz Eugen up through the English Channel. These caused a planned attack against the outbound convoy PQ 8 at the end of January to be abandoned.Garzke & Dulin, p. 250 A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.Sweetman, pp. 2324 In early February, Tirpitz took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation Cerberus. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the North Sea.Sweetman, pp. 2425 Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers German cruiser Admiral Scheer Admiral Scheer and Prinz Eugen and several destroyers. Prinz Eugen had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the Fttenfjord, and was therefore temporarily out of action.Sweetman, pp. 2526

Tirpitz and Admiral Scheer, along with the destroyers German destroyer Z14 Friedrich Ihn Friedrich Ihn, Paul Jacobi, German destroyer Z7 Hermann Schoemann Hermann Schoemann and German destroyer Z25 Z-25 and a pair of torpedo boats, were intended to attack the homebound convoy Convoy QP 8 QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound Convoy PQ 12 PQ&nbsp;12 in March 1942 as part of Operation Sportpalast Operation Sportpalast Sports Palace.Sweetman, p. 27 Admiral Scheer, with a design speed of convert 26 kn abbr=on,Grner, p. 60 was too slow to operate with Tirpitz, and was left in port, as was the destroyer Paul Jacobi. The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation. On 5 March, Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ&nbsp;12 near Jan Mayen Island; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship HMS Duke of York 17 6 or the battlecruiser HMS Renown 1916 6, both of which escorted the convoy, along with four destroyers. Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey provided distant support to the convoys with the battleship HMS King George V 41 6, the aircraft carrier HMS Victorious R38 6, the heavy cruiser HMS Berwick 65 6, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of Tirpitz's attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue Tirpitz on 9 March, but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and Tirpitz successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 250251 Tirpitz's anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.Rohwer, p. 149 After the conclusion of the attack, Tirpitz made for Vestfjord, and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.Garzke & Dulin, p. 253 On 30 March, thirty-three Handley Page Halifax Halifax bombers attacked the ship; they scored no hits and five aircraft were shot down.Rohwer, p. 156 The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 2728 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve Avro Lancaster Lancasters; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.Rohwer, p. 162
The actions of Tirpitz and her escorting destroyers in March used up convert 8230 MT sp=us of fuel oil, which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. Convoy PQ 17, which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by Tirpitz and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway, during Operation Rsselsprung 1942 Operation Rsselsprung Knight_chess#Movement Knight's Move.Sweetman, p. 54 Escorting the convoy were the battleships Duke of York and USS Washington BB-56 6 and the carrier Victorious. Tirpitz, German cruiser Admiral Hipper Admiral Hipper, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of German cruiser Deutschland Ltzow, Admiral Scheer, and six destroyers operated out of Narvik.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 253255 Ltzow and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port. Shortly after Tirpitz left Norway, the Soviet submarine Soviet K class submarine K-21 fired a pair of torpedoes at the ship, both of which missed.Garzke & Dulin, p. 255 The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship.Blair, p. 644 Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty, which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to U-boats and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. Tirpitz returned to Altafjord via the Lofoten Islands.

Following Operation Rsselsprung, the Germans moved Tirpitz to Bogen, Evenes Bogenfjord near Narvik. By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to Fttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional antiaircraft guns were installed and double anti-torpedo nets were erected around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, such that Tirpitz would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A Caisson engineering caisson was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders. During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two Human torpedo Chariot human torpedoes; rough seas incapacitated the boat carrying torpedoes. By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and Tirpitz began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4 January 1943 in the Trondheimfjord.Garzke & Dulin, p. 258 On 21 February, Topp was promoted to Rear Admiral and was replaced by Captain Hans Meyer; five days later the battleship Scharnhorst was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral Oskar Kummetz was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.Sweetman, pp. 7374
By the time Scharnhorst arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased. To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral Karl Dnitz, who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, ordered Operation Zitronella an attack on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base. Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile.Torkildsen, p. 221 The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6 September; in a Ruse of war ruse de guerre, Tirpitz flew a white flag on the approach to the island the following day.Sweetman, p. 76 During the bombardment, Tirpitz fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.Sweetman, p. 77 This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy target. An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.Sweetman, pp. 7677 By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.
British attacks on Tirpitz
=Operation Source=
File:Tirpitz altafjord.jpg thumb Tirpitz in the Altafjord
The British were determined to neutralise Tirpitz and remove the threat she posed to Allied lines of communication in the Arctic. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed X class submarine X Craft midget submarines. The planned attack, Operation Source, included attacks on Tirpitz, Scharnhorst, and Ltzow.Zetterling & Tamelander, pp. 195196 The X Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets to attach a powerful naval mine mine to the bottom of the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 2025 September 1943. Only eight of the vessels reached Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September. Three of the vessels, X5, X6, and X7, successfully breached Tirpitz's defences, two of whichX6 and X7managed to lay their mines. X5 was detected some convert 200 m abbr=on from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 258259
The mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar and the second detonated convert 45 to 55 m abbr=on off the port bow.Garzke & Dulin, p. 259 A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship and bulkheads in the double bottom buckled. Some convert 1430 MT abbr=on of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a List watercraft list of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all save one generator in generator room No. 1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be trained; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 259261 The ship's two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes were thrown by the explosive concussion and completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship German repair ship Neumark Neumark; historians Robert Garzke and Robert Dulin remarked that the successful repair effort was one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War.Garzke & Dulin, p. 262 Repairs lasted until 2 April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.Garzke & Dulin, p. 264
=Operation Tungsten=
File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg thumb Tirpitz under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944
The British were aware that Neumark and the repair crews left in March, which intimated Tirpitz was nearly operational. A major air strikeOperation Tungsteninvolving the fleet carriers Victorious and HMS Furious 47 2 and the escort carriers HMS Emperor D98 2, HMS Fencer D64 2, HMS Pursuer D73 2, and HMS Searcher D40 2,Breyer, p. 26 was set for 4 April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that Tirpitz was to depart at 05:29 on 3 April for sea trials. The attack consisted of 40 Fairey Barracuda Barracuda dive-bombers carrying convert 1600 lb adj=on armor-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.Brown 2009, pp. 25, 27 The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave;  it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of Tirpitz's antiaircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German antiaircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.Garzke & Dulin, p. 265
The air strike caused significant damage to the ship and inflicted serious casualties. William Garzke and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others, while Hildebrand, Rhr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, KzS Hans Meyer.Hildebrand, Rhr, & Steinmetz, p. 243 Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some convert 2000 MT abbr=on of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 265267 Dnitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood Tirpitz could no longer be used in a surface action due to insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2 June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage antiaircraft fire were supplied.Garzke & Dulin, p. 267
=Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot, and Goodwood=
A series of carrier strikes were planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from Victorious and Furious, was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. Victorious and Furious were joined by HMS Indefatigable R10 2 for Operation Mascot, which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. The weather finally broke in late August, which saw the Goodwood series of attacks. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers Furious, Indefatigable and HMS Formidable 67 2 and the escort carriers HMS Nabob D77 2 and HMS Trumpeter D09 2 launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on Tirpitz, and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down. Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage. One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No. 4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a convert 500 lb adj=on bomb, exploded but caused only superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.Garzke & Dulin, pp. 267268Brown 2009, p. 28 Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from Formidable and Indefatigable. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored. One Fairey Firefly Firefly and a Vought F4U Corsair Corsair were shot down by Tirpitz's gunners. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light antiaircraft ammunition.Brown 1977, p. 39
=Operations Paravane and Obviate=
The ineffectiveness of the vast majority of the strikes launched by the Fleet Air Arm in mid-1944 led to the task of Tirpitz's destruction being transferred to the RAF's No. 5 Group RAF No. 5 Group. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry convert 6 ST adj=on Tallboy bomb Tallboy bombs to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.Sweetman, pp. 132139 The first attack, Operation Paravane, took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at Yagodnik in Russia, 23 Lancasters 17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve Johnny Walker bomb#Inventions JW mines, scored a single hit on the ship's bow. The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. convert 800 to 1000 MT abbr=on of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in Glossary_of_nautical_terms#T trim forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to convert 8 to 10 kn abbr=on. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing Tirpitz to be moved further south to Troms. On 15 October, the ship made the convert 200 nmi abbr=on trip to Troms under her own power, the last voyage of her career.Garzke & Dulin, p. 268
The RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off Hky Island outside Troms. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate. As on Operation Paravane, No. IX Squadron RAF No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss, partially the result of bad weather over the target.Sweetman, p. 193 The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. Tirpitz's 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based antiaircraft guns. Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing and anti-torpedo nets were installed. Tirpitz retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the turbo-generators and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.Garzke & Dulin, p. 270

Operation Catechism, the final British attack on Tirpitz, took place on 12 November 1944. The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; Tirpitz's main guns forced the bombers to temporarily disperse, but could not break up the attack.Garzke & Dulin, p. 272 A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss. Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit amidships between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown into the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the ship on the port side of turret Caesar. The amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes, the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees; the captain issued the order to abandon ship. Progressive flooding increased the list to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50, though this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown convert 25 m abbr=on into the air and over into a group of men swimming to shore. Tirpitz then rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.Garzke & Dulin, p. 273
In the aftermath of the attack, rescue operations attempted to reach men trapped in the hull. Workers managed to rescue 82 men by cutting through the bottom hull plates. Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.refn   group = Note   John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,Sweetman, p. 248 while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.Zetterling & Tamelander, p. 327 Siegfried Breyer and Erich Grner agree on 1,204 deaths, and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971. William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at about 950. Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser Ltzow in January 1945.Prager, p. 287 The wreck remained in place until after the war, when a joint German-Norwegian company began salvage operations. Work lasted from 1948 until 1957; fragments of the ship are still sold by a Norwegian company. Ludovic Kennedy wrote in his history of the vessel that she lived an invalid's life and died a cripple's death.Van der Vat, p. 508
The performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of Tirpitz was highly criticised after her loss. Major Heinrich Ehrler, the commander of III./Jagdgeschwader 5 3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing, was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was subsequently court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was shown that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but he was released after a month, demoted, and reassigned to an Messerschmitt Me 262 Me 262 fighter squadron in Germany.Morgan & Weal, p. 60 On 4 April 1945, he was shot down over Berlin; he had told a comrade that he intended to ram a bomber after running out of ammunition, stating We'll meet again in Valhalla.Zetterling & Tamelander, p. 233
References in the Wehrmachtbericht
Tirpitz was referenced three times in the Wehrmachtbericht, a radio information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour.The dispatch regarding the air attack on 4 April claims Tirpitz shot down four British aircraft, along with two more by a patrol boat, though only two aircraft were destroyed during the attack.

  The Soviet claim that the German battleship Tirpitz had received a torpedo hit is fictional. The battleship is not damaged and has not even been under attack.
