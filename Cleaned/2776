Berkelium forms a number of chemical compounds, where it normally exists in an Oxidation number oxidation state of +3 or +4, and behaves similarly to its lanthanide analogue, terbium.cite journal doi=10.2172/932812 last1=Thompson year=1950 first1=Stanley G. last2=Seaborg first2=Glenn T. url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/932812-Rk9Mcq/ Like all actinides, berkelium easily dissolves in various aqueous solution aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the trivalent oxidation state. This trivalent state is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts.cite journal last1=Sullivan first1=Jim C. last2=Schmidt first2=K.

The color of the Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid.Peterson, p. 55Holleman, p. 1956Greenwood, p. 1265 Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide surface layer; however, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds.cite book first1 = David E. last1 = Hobart first2 = Joseph R. last2 = Peterson contribution = Berkelium title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements editor1-first = Lester R. editor1-last = Morss editor2-first = Norman M. editor2-last = Edelstein editor3-first = Jean editor3-last = Fuger edition = 3rd year = 2006 volume = 3 publisher = Springer location = Dordrecht, the Netherlands pages = 144498 url = http://radchem.nevada.edu/classes/rdch710/files/berkelium.pdf doi = 10.1007/1-4020-3598-5_10Peterson, p. 45 Berkelium can also form several organometallic compounds.
Oxides
Two oxides of berkelium are known, with berkelium in the +3 Bk2O3 and +4 BkO2 oxidation states.cite journal last1=Peterson first1=J title=Crystal structures and lattice parameters of the compounds of berkelium I. Berkelium dioxide and cubic berkelium sesquioxide journal=Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry Letters volume=3 pages=327 year=1967 doi=10.1016/0020-16506780037-0 BerkeliumIV oxide is a brown solid that crystallizes in a cubic fluorite crystal structure with the space group Fmoverline 3m and the coordination numbers of Bk8 and O4. The lattice parameter is 533.4  0.5 picometer pm.cite journal last1=Baybarz first1=R.D. title=The berkelium oxide system journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry volume=30 pages=1769 year=1968 doi=10.1016/0022-19026880352-5
BerkeliumIII oxide, a yellow-green solid, is formed from BkO2 by redox reduction with hydrogen:
:\mathrm2\ BkO_2\ +\ H_2\ \longrightarrow \ Bk_2O_3\ +\ H_2O
The compound has a melting point of 1920 C,Holleman, p. 1972 body-centered cubic crystal lattice and a lattice constant a = 1088.0  0.5 pm. Upon heating to 1200 C, the cubic Bk2O3 transforms to a monoclinic structure, which further converts to a hexagonal phase at 1750 C; the latter transition is reversible. Such three-phase behavior is typical for the actinide sesquioxides.Peterson, p. 51
A divalent oxide BkO has been reported as a brittle gray solid with a Cubic crystal system face centered cubic fcc structure and a lattice constant a = 496.4 pm, but its exact chemical composition is uncertain.
Halides
In halides, berkelium assumes the oxidation states +3 and +4.Holleman, p. 1969 The +3 state is most stable, especially in solutions, and the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only known in the solid phase.Peterson, p. 47 The coordination of the berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped Octahedral molecular geometry#Trigonal prismatic geometry trigonal prismatic, with a coordination number of 9. In the trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic coordination 8 or Octahedral molecular geometry octahedral coordination 6, and in the iodide it is octahedral.

BerkeliumIV fluoride BkF4 is a yellow-green ionic solid which crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system Pearson symbol mS60, space group C2/c No. 15, lattice constants a = 1247 pm, b = 1058 pm, c = 817 pm and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconiumIV fluoride.Peterson, p. 48cite journal last1=Keenan first1=Thomas K. last2=Asprey first2=Larned B. title=Lattice constants of actinide tetrafluorides including berkelium journal=Inorganic Chemistry volume=8 pages=235 year=1969 doi=10.1021/ic50072a011
BerkeliumIII fluoride BkF3 is also a yellow-green solid, but it has two crystalline structures. The most stable phase at low temperatures has an Orthorhombic crystal system orthorhombic symmetry, isotypic with yttriumIII fluoride Pearson symbol oP16, space group Pnma, No. 62, a = 670 pm, b = 709 pm, c = 441 pm. Upon heating to 350 to 600 C, it transforms to a trigonal crystal system trigonal structure found in lanthanumIII fluoride Pearson symbol hP24, space group Poverline 3c1, No. 165, a = 697 pm, c = 714 pm.cite journal last1=Ensor first1=D title=Absorption spectrophotometric study of berkeliumIII and IV fluorides in the solid state journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry volume=43 pages=1001 year=1981 doi=10.1016/0022-19028180164-9cite journal last1=Peterson first1=J.R. last2=Cunningham first2=B.B. title=Crystal structures and lattice parameters of the compounds of berkeliumIV berkelium trifluoride journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry volume=30 pages=1775 year=1968 doi=10.1016/0022-19026880353-7
Visible amounts of berkeliumIII chloride BkCl3 were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature of about 500 C. This green solid has a melting point of 603 C and crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system isotypic with uraniumIII chloride Pearson symbol hP8, space group P63/m, No. 176.cite journal last1=Peterson first1=J.R. last2=Cunningham first2=B.B. title=Crystal structures and lattice parameters of the compounds of berkeliumIIBerkelium trichloride journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry volume=30 pages=823 year=1968 doi=10.1016/0022-19026880443-9cite journal last1=Peterson first1=J.

G. title=Absorption spectrophotometric and x-ray diffraction studies of the trichlorides of berkelium-249 and californium-249 journal=Inorganic Chemistry volume=25 pages=3779 year=1986 doi=10.1021/ic00241a015 Upon heating to just below its melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic crystal system orthorhombic phase.Peterson, p. 52 The hexahydrate BkCl36H2O berkelium trichloride hexahydrate has a monoclinic crystal system monoclinic structure with the lattice constants a = 966 pm, b = 654 pm and c = 797 pm.cite journal last1=Burns first1=John H. last2=Peterson first2=Joseph Richard title=Crystal structures of americium trichloride hexahydrate and berkelium trichloride hexahydrate journal=Inorganic Chemistry volume=10 pages=147 year=1971 doi=10.1021/ic50095a029 Another berkeliumIII chloride, Cs2NaBkCl6 can be crystallized from a chilled aqueous solution containing berkeliumIII hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and caesium chloride. It has a face-centered cubic structure where BkIII ions are surrounded by chloride ions in an octahedral configuration.
The ternary berkeliumIV chloride Cs2BkCl6 is obtained by dissolving berkeliumIV hydroxide in a chilled solution of caesium chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid. It forms orange hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 745.1 pm and c = 1209.7 pm. The average radius of the BkCl62 ion in this compound is estimated as 270 pm.
Two forms of berkeliumIII bromide are known, a monoclinic with berkelium coordination 6 and orthorhombic with coordination 8;Peterson, p. 38 the latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350 C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied for these two crystal forms: the structures of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples were studied using X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of 249Bk had beta decayed to 249californium Cf. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3249CfBr3 transformation, even though the orthorhombic bromide was previously unknown for californium. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to249CfBr2, but the former could be not  this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides. The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Besides a chemical contamination, 249Cf, as an alpha emitter brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice due to the resulting self-heating. This can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.
BerkeliumIII iodide forms hexagonal crystals with the lattice constants a = 758.4 pm and c = 2087 pm. The known oxyhalides of berkelium include BkOCl, BkOBr and BkOI; they all crystallize in a tetragonal lattice.
Other inorganic compounds
Pnictides
The monopnictides of berkelium-249 are known for the elements nitrogen,cite journal last1=Stevenson first1=J last2=Peterson first2=J title=Preparation and structural studies of elemental curium-248 and the nitrides of curium-248 and berkelium-249 journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals volume=66 pages=201 year=1979 doi=10.1016/0022-50887990229-7 phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They are prepared by the reaction of either berkeliumIII hydride BkH3 or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperatures about 600 C under high vacuum in quartz ampoules. They crystallize in the cubic crystal system with the lattice constant of 495.1 pm for BkN, 566.9 pm for BkP, 582.9 for BkAs and 619.1 pm for BkSb.cite journal last1=Damien first1=D. last2=Haire first2=R.G. last3=Peterson first3=J.R. title=Preparation and lattice parameters of 249Bk monopnictides journal=Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry volume=42 pages=995 year=1980 doi=10.1016/0022-19028080390-3 These lattice constant values are smaller than those in curium pnictides, but are comparable to those of terbium pnictides.
Chalcogenides
BerkeliumIII sulfide, Bk2S3, has been prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfidevapors at 1130 C, or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals with a cubic symmetry and lattice constant a = 844 pm.
Other compounds
BerkeliumIII and berkeliumIV hydroxides are both stable in 1 Molar concentration M sodium hydroxide solutions. BerkeliumIII phosphate BkPO4 has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under Ion laser argon laser 514.5&nbsp;nm line excitation.Peterson, pp. 3940 Berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 C. They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x 0 Peterson, p. 53 Several other salts of berkelium are known, including Bk2O2S, BkNO334H2O, BkCl36H2O, Bk2SO4312H2O and Bk2C2O434H2O. Thermal decomposition at about 600 C in an argon atmosphere to avoid oxidation to Bk2O of Bk2SO4312H2O yields the body-centered orthorhombic crystals of berkeliumIV oxysulfate Bk2O2SO4. This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 C in an inert atmosphere.Peterson, p. 54
Organoberkelium compounds
Berkelium forms a trigonal 5C5H53Bk complex with three Cyclopentadienyl complex cyclopentadienyl rings, which can be synthesized by reacting berkeliumIII chloride with the molten beryllocene BeC5H52 at about 70 C. It has an amber color and orthorhombic symmetry, with the lattice constants of a = 1411 pm, b = 1755 pm and c = 963 pm and the calculated density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound within a period of weeks.cite journal last1=Laubereau first1=Peter G. last2=Burns first2=John H. title=Microchemical preparation of tricyclopentadienyl compounds of berkelium, californium, and some lanthanide elements journal=Inorganic Chemistry volume=9 pages=1091 year=1970 doi=10.1021/ic50087a018Christoph Elschenbroich Organometallic Chemistry, 6th Edition, Wiesbaden 2008, ISBN 978-3-8351-0167-8, pp. 583584 One C5H5 ring in 5C5H53Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield BkC5H52Cl2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound are very similar to those of 5C5H53Bk.Peterson, p. 41
