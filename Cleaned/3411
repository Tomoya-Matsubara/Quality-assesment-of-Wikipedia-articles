Desperate Teenage Lovedolls is a 1984 low budget underground film, shot on super-8 film by David Markey, about a rock band of teenage runaways (loosely based on the story of The Runaways, the 1970s band that launched the careers of Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and Cherie Currie) and their misadventures. The film was released on DVD in 2003. A sequel, Lovedolls Superstar, was released in 1986.
Plot
Two girls rediscover their love for playing rock (evidently there is a back story, and they had had a band before), find a drummer and begin practicing. When one of their mothers intervenes, they run away from home and are forced to fend for themselves on the streets against gangs and rival bands. Soon they are discovered and taken under the wing of rock manager Johnny Tremaine (played by Steven Shane McDonald) who uses them for sex and his own aspirations of wealth, and set out to get revenge on those who have wronged them, and rise to the top of the rock world.
Trivia
The film contains a cameo by a then-unknown Saul Hudson, who would go on to become known as Slash, the world-famous lead guitarist of Guns N' Roses.
DVD Release
In 2003, the film was released in extended DVD format as Desperate Teenage Lovedolls (20th anniversary edition).
