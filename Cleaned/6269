History
WNVZ originally signed on the air in 1967 as a simulcast of Country music outlet 1270 WTID, (which is now separately owned Religious outlet WTJZ ) but by 1973 they would break off the simulcast and become WQRK, broadcasting a Top 40 format with custom made jingles, sped up records, and a lot of on air audio processing (Then known as &quot;QRK&quot; and &quot;Super Q&quot; at the time).In 1975 WQRK went from live to automated Top 40,in the late 70s and early 80s they evolved into a Live Adult Contemporary format.
But that would all change in August 1982 when they returned to a mainstream Top 40 format as Z104,and debuted the WNVZ calls and Z104 name. (The station marked the retiring of the &quot;Q104 1/2&quot; moniker and hailed the return of the CHR format on the air with the slogan &quot;The Half Has Become a Whole.&quot;) About a year later they were using Mike Joseph's &quot;Hot Hits&quot; format, which had been done in several larger markets, but dropped Joseph by summer of 1985 By 1993 they would evolve into a Rhythmic Top 40 direction. Today, it uses the slogan &quot;Today's Best Music&quot; to describe its broad-based mix of Hip-Hop/R&amp;B and Rhythmic Pop hits. This pits the station against its urban contemporary hip hop/R&amp;B competitor WOWI.

Trivia
The station flipped its format and positioning several weeks before acquiring its new call letters in late 1982, which meant that for a short period of time the station was using a new nickname (Z104) that was completely unrelated to its call letters (which were still WQRK). This resulted in a very curious-sounding top-of-the-hour station IDs that went something like: &quot;Z-104 is WQRK, Norfolk&quot;
