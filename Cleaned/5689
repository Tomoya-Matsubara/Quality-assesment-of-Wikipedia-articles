King's Head Mill or Caldbec Hill Mill is a grade II listed1 smock mill at Battle, Sussex, England which has been converted to residential accommodation.
History
King's Head Mill was built in 1805, replacing a post mill. The mill was working until the First World War and in 1924 was stripped of its machinery and house converted. The work was done by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights.2
Description
King's Head Mill is a four storey smock mill on a single storey brick base. It has a Kentish style cap winded by a fantail. When working it had four shuttered sails carried on a cast iron windshaft, driving three pairs of millstones. The current windshaft is a dummy, added when the mill was converted. The original windshaft is displayed at Polegate windmill.3
