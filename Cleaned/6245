Reception
Critical reception
These Are Special Times garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Paul Verna from Billboard gave it a very positive review, praising Dion's maturity and the album's production.31 He wrote, &quot;sounding at complete ease and wielding a wildly creative wand, an ever-maturing Dion conjures up surprise on what should be regarded as her next &quot;big&quot; album.&quot;32 Verna noted that this &quot;grade-A effort&quot; is &quot;no ordinary holiday project.&quot;33 He praised &quot;grandiose versions of standards&quot; (&quot;O Holy Night,&quot; &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot;), &quot;modern classics&quot; (&quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over),&quot; &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot;) and a &quot;thoughtfully produced original compositions&quot; (&quot;Another Year Has Gone By,&quot; &quot;Don't Save It All for Christmas Day&quot;).34 According to him, other highlights include &quot;The Prayer,&quot; a &quot;gorgeous duet&quot; with Andrea Bocelli, the &quot;Phil Spector-esque&quot; &quot;Christmas Eve,&quot; and a &quot;sparkling reading&quot; of &quot;Ave Maria.&quot;35
Chuck Taylor from Billboard also praised &quot;I'm Your Angel,&quot; a duet with R. Kelly. He wrote that &quot;this wonderfully restrained ballad delights with the most graceful vocal performances either of these artists has ever offered to radio.&quot;36 Taylor commented, &quot;what raises the roof is the tune's elegant, epic instrumental base, which includes sweeping strings, a soulful choir, and gentle but determined percussive drive.&quot;37 He continued, that &quot;I'm Your Angel&quot; &quot;sells big at the bridge, where the instrumentation drops and Kelly and Dion harmonize in a gorgeous minor key &lt;U+2013&gt; it truly makes the song.&quot;38 Chuck Taylor also reviewed &quot;The Prayer&quot;, calling it &quot;a breathtaking, ultra-lush song, and the tour de force combination of Dion and Bocelli [which] will send a half-dozen chills up your spine.&quot;39 Although he felt that the song is &quot;an unorthodox track for the radio&quot;, Taylor called it &quot;affecting,&quot; &quot;heartwarming,&quot; &quot;absolutely exquisite&quot; and &quot;one of Dion's most radiant performances ever.&quot;40
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that &quot;any fan of Dion, or of '90s adult contemporary pop in general, should find this [album] very enjoyable.&quot;41 Although according to him, &quot;at times, the production is too slick&quot; and &quot;at other times Dion's vocals are a little mannered,&quot; overall, These Are Special Times &quot;is very effective, because the songs are good and she's committed to the material.&quot;42 Erlewine wrote that These Are Special Times is &quot;an especially successful holiday album since Dion wisely balances&quot; popular carols (&quot;Blue Christmas,&quot; &quot;The Christmas Song,&quot; &quot;Feliz Navidad&quot;) with new songs (&quot;I'm Your Angel,&quot; &quot;Don't Save It All for Christmas&quot;), hymns (&quot;Adeste Fideles,&quot; &quot;Ave Maria&quot;), and Christmas songs with a distinct religious theme (&quot;The Prayer,&quot; &quot;O Holy Night&quot;).&quot;43
