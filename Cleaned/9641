The WWS-3 Delphin Dolphin was a single-seat glider designed and built in Poland from  1936.
 Development 
To provide a higher performance glider, to complement the W.W.S.1 Salamandra and W.W.S.2 aba,  Wacaw Czerwiski designed an all wood glider with smooth lines derived from wind tunnel tests at the Lwow technical University. With a stiff structure optimised for higher speeds the W.W.S. 3 had pleasant flying characteristics. The first prototype was built with two alternative tailplanes, one conventional with separate elevator, the other an all-flying surface, both of which were evaluated in airworthiness trials at the I.B.T.L. Instytut Bada Technicznych Lotnictwa  Institute of Aviation Technical Research during 1937. Production aircraft were produced at W.W.S and at L.W.L.Lwwskie Warsztaty Lotnicze  Lww Avaition Workshops with the all-flying tail for pitch control.
The cantilever gull wings were constructed as a divided pair with diagonal supplementary spars and plywood skinned leading edge D torsion box. The fuselage was constructed as a semi-monocoque shell with integral fin carrying the rudder and all-flying tailplane. A pneumatically-sprung nose skid formed the undercarriage.
Production continued till the outbreak of WWII, with most aircraft being destroyed except for examples confiscated by the German and Soviet authorities. One example taken by German forces was left behind in Denmark at the end of the war and refurbished for the Stamgruppen Gliding Club regn OY-DYX, where it flew for several yearsCynk, Jerzy B.
