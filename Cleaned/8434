The Magnificent Mile, sometimes referred to as The Mag Mile, is a prestigious section of Chicago's Michigan Avenue, running from the Chicago River to Oak Street in the Near North Side.1 The district is located adjacent to downtown, and one block east of Rush Street, which is known for its nightlife. The Magnificent Mile serves as the main thoroughfare between Chicago's Loop business district and its Gold Coast.2 It also serves as the western boundary of the Streeterville neighborhood.
Real estate developer Arthur Rubloff of Rubloff Company gave the nickname to one of the city's most prestigious residential and commercial thoroughfares in the 1940s.3 Currently Chicago's largest shopping district, various mid-range and high-end shops line this section of the street and approximately  is currently occupied by retail stores, restaurants, museums and hotels.4 Several of the tallest buildings in the United States, such as the John Hancock Center and the Trump International Hotel and Tower, lie in the district. Numerous landmarks are located along the Magnificent Mile, such as the Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, the Chicago Water Tower and the Allerton Hotel.
History
 After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, State Street (anchored by Marshall Field's) in the downtown Loop, especially the Loop Retail Historic District, was the city's retailing center.5 The convenience of mass transit including streetcars and elevated trains, supported a retail corridor along State Street from Lake Street to Van Buren Street.6 By the 1920s, commuter suburbs began to have significant retail districts.7 Prior to the bascule bridge construction, swing bridges across the river were open for ship traffic during half the daylight hours.8 The Rush Street Bridge was the swing bridge for this area.9 The opening of the Michigan Avenue Bridge in 1920 created a new commercial district.10 After 1950, suburban development reduced the role of the Loop's daily significance to many Chicagoans as downtown retail sales slipped. However, the Magnificent Mile kept a luxury shopping district close to the central business district.11
The concept for the Magnificent Mile was actually part of Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago.12 It was constructed during the 1920s to replace Pine Street, which had formerly been lined with factory and warehouses near the river and fine mansion and rowhouse residences farther north.13 The earliest building constructions varied in style, but challenged new heights in construction.14 The name the &quot;Magnificent Mile&quot; is a registered trademark of the Greater North Michigan Avenue Association (GNMAA).15
After the Great Depression and World War II, Arthur Rubloff and William Zeckendorf bought or controlled most of the property along this stretch of the avenue and supported a plan by Holabird &amp; Root to construct new buildings and renovation of old ones that took advantage of new zoning laws.16 Soon the property values driven by the luxury shopping districts were pricing out the nearby artists of Towertown, just south west of the Chicago Water Tower.17 Having acquired most of the rights to property along the Magnificent Mile at Depression-level prices, Rubloff and Zeckendorf successfully developed and promoted the area until it became one of the most prestigious addresses of the city. That distinction continues to hold today,18 and spurred the continuing erection of more high-rise apartments and new investment along the Magnificent Mile and throughout the Near North Side.19
The opening of the 74-story Water Tower Place in 1975 marked the return of Chicago to retailing prominence.20 By 1979, the State Street commercial corridor had lost its commercial vitality and was closed to street traffic for renovation including sidewalk widening until 1996.21
Today

The area also has a high concentration of the city's major media firms, such as the Chicago Tribune newspaper, and advertising agencies. The Magnificent Mile includes  of retail space, 460 stores, 275 restaurants, 51 hotels, and a host of sightseeing and entertainment attractions to more than 22 million visitors annually.22 The American Planning Association selected The Magnificent Mile as one of the 10 Great Streets for 2007 through its Great Places in America program.23 In recent years, The Magnificent Mile has added trees and flower-filled medians to reflect the changing seasons.

Seasonal events
 With each season, the ambiance of The Magnificent Mile changes. This change is signaled by several official events:4849
Median planters were constructed as part of a streetscape improvement project in 1994. In the spring, Tulips on The Magnificent Mile occurs from mid April until the end of May. Hundreds of thousands of tulips bloom on The Magnificent Mile. Typically, they bloom between April 16 and May 7. In 2008, a public art installation of kinetic sculptures designed by local and international architects was placed in the garden beds.50
During the summer, the &quot;Gardens of The Magnificent Mile&quot; festival event occurs. It is a self-guided landscape display walking tour. In 2007 and 2008, fashion dress forms graced the garden beds. The forms were designed by students from the Illinois Institute of Art &lt;U+2013&gt; Chicago and the International Academy of Design and Technology, as well as prominent designers located on the Avenue.5152 In 2009 and 2010 the first ever Summer Concert Series presented by Walgreens brought top level musical talent to the Avenue for free lunchtime shows for guest, locals and employees of the Avenue. Past artists include: Collective Soul, Better Than Ezra, Mat Kearney, Michael Franti, Kris Allen and Guster.
 The tradition of lighting the trees of The Magnificent Mile to start the holiday season extends for more than forty years. More than one million lights are lit and fireworks follow the event.53 2010 will host the 19th annual Magnificent Mile Lights Festival, presented by Harris, which will be the annual kick-off to the nation's holiday season.54 The day of the event has special activities and offers across Magnificent Mile businesses, plus interactive holiday booths in Pioneer Court and a free concert with free concerts featuring popular artists all afternoon on the Harris Stage (past artists have included Jason Mraz, Mitchel Musso, Cheetah Girls, KT Tunstall and more). In the evening, Mickey Mouse leads a procession down Michigan Avenue from Oak Street to Wacker Drive, stopping at each block to light the trees. He brings along a lot of friends, including Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, other Disney friends, marching bands, celebrities and more! It is considered the first annual Holiday procession of the year.55
Transportation &amp; Infrastructure
North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane two-way street that is serviced by Chicago Transit Authority public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect the area to the entire Chicago metropolitan area. It is also serviced by seasonal trolley service along the street, and the foot of the Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via its Red Line. Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.56
In autumn 2011, North Michigan Ave. was completely repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a durable stone-matrix asphalt pavement mix that incorporated high levels of recycled materials, including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and asphalt millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills.57 The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street. In July 2012, the City of Chicago and CDOT were honored with the Environmental Leadership Award from the National Asphalt Pavement Association.58
