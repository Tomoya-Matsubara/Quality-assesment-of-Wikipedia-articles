New York State Route 245 is a state highway in the Finger Lakes District of the U.S. state of New York. The southern terminus of the route is at NY 21 in Naples. The northern terminus is at NY 5, U.S. Route 20 and NY 14A west of Geneva. From Geneva to Naples, NY 245 traverses the land from the north end of Seneca Lake to the south end of Canandaigua Lake in roughly a northeast to southwest direction.

NY 245 begins at an intersection with NY 21 immediately north of Naples in Ontario County.1 The route heads to the northeast along the base of a series of mountains delimiting the Canandaigua Lake valley, entering Yates County before following the valley surrounding the West River at a fork in the primary valley near the southern end of Canandaigua Lake. NY 245 follows the eastern edge of the valley to Middlesex, where it intersects NY 364 in the village center. NY 245 and NY 364 run concurrent for a block before NY 364 splits from NY 245 to ascend the eastern edge of the valley and continue towards Potter. North of Middlesex, the valley becomes less prominent as NY 245 progresses northward.23 Near the Ontario County line, NY 245 turns northeast to serve the dual-county village of Rushville. Within the village, NY 245 meets NY 247. The two routes embark on an overlap northward into Ontario County.45
Shortly into Ontario County, NY 247 separates from NY 245, taking a due north alignment through the town of Gorham. NY 245 continues eastward through predominantly hilly terrain, passing through the hamlets of Gorham (where it crosses Flint Creek) and Stanley (centered around a former junction between the Pennsylvania and Lehigh Valley railroads adjacent to NY 245) before meeting NY 14A at a rural junction in the town of Seneca. The routes merge, forming a concurrency northward to the outskirts of Geneva, where both routes end at the concurrent routes of US 20 and NY 5.678
History
NY 245 was originally assigned to what is now NY 39 between Pike and Leicester as part of the 1930 renumbering.9 Between 1938 and 1946, the routings of NY 245 and NY 39 east of Pike were swapped,1011 placing NY 39 on its modern alignment12 and routing NY 245 along what is now Griffith Road to Portageville, NY 436 from Portageville to Dansville,13 NY 63 from Dansville to Wayland, NY 21 from Wayland to Naples, and its current alignment from Naples to Geneva.14
In 1972, NY 245 was truncated to its current western terminus in Naples. The former routing of NY 245 between Pike and Dansville was redesignated as NY 436 while the segment from Dansville from Wayland became part of an extended NY 63. The Wayland-Naples portion remained part of NY 21, which NY 245 overlapped between the two villages.1516 By the following year, NY 245 was extended back to Wayland via NY 21. Instead of continuing west as it did pre-1972, NY 245 followed then-U.S. Route 15 (now NY 15) and NY 21 south to what is now Interstate 390 exit 3 south of the village. NY 245 turned west onto the partially-completed freeway (only Wayland to Dansville had been built at the time), following the expressway to NY 36 near Dansville Municipal Airport, where NY 245, as well as the freeway, ended at what was then an at-grade intersection near the current exit 5.1718 The length of the freeway was formerly designated as NY 401 before becoming part of NY 245.19 By 1976, NY 245 was truncated on its western end to Naples while the freeway became I-390. The portion in between remained part of NY 15 (from I-390 to Wayland) and NY 21.20
