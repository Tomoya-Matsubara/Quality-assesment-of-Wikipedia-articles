He last played for the AAA Quintana Roo Tigres of the Mexican Baseball League1, however he was banned from the Mexican League in 2012 for refusing to submit to a drug test and admitting to taking testosterone.2 He played for the Oakland Athletics (1985&lt;U+2013&gt;1992, 1997) Texas Rangers (1992&lt;U+2013&gt;1994), Boston Red Sox (1995&lt;U+2013&gt;1996), Toronto Blue Jays (1998), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000), New York Yankees (2000) and Chicago White Sox (2001). During his career, Canseco was a six-time All-Star, four-time Silver Slugger Award winner, American League (AL) Rookie of the Year, and AL Most Valuable Player.
Canseco has admitted using performance enhancing drugs during his playing career, and wrote a tell-all book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits &amp; How Baseball Got Big, in which he claimed that the vast majority of MLB players use steroids.
Canseco is the identical twin brother of former major league player Ozzie Canseco. After retiring from Major League Baseball, he also competed in boxing and mixed martial arts.
Early years
Canseco was born in Havana, Cuba, and left Cuba with his cousins and family when he and his identical twin brother were infants. They relocated to the United States, with Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Ozzie growing up in the Miami, Florida area, and attending Coral Park High School.
Baseball career (1982–present)
Minor league baseball (1982&lt;U+2013&gt;1985)
The Oakland Athletics drafted Canseco in the 15th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft. He played minor league baseball with the Madison Muskies, Idaho Falls A's, and the Modesto A's. Canseco started the 1985 season with the Class-AA Huntsville Stars and became known as &quot;Parkway Jose&quot;, for his long home runs (25 in half a season), that went close to the Memorial Parkway behind Joe Davis Stadium.
Major League Baseball (1985–2001)
Oakland Athetics (1985&lt;U+2013&gt;92)
In 1985, Canseco won the Baseball America Minor League Player of the Year Award, and was a late season call-up for the Oakland Athletics, playing in 29 games in the major leagues in . He gained notoriety in , his first full season, being named the American League's Rookie of the Year, with 33 home runs and 117 runs batted in. In , Mark McGwire joined Canseco on the Athletics; McGwire hit 49 home runs that year and was also named the American League Rookie of the Year. Together, he and Canseco formed a fearsome offensive tandem, known as the &quot;Bash Brothers&quot;.
In , Canseco became the first player in major league history to hit at least 40 home runs and steal at least 40 bases in the same year, by hitting 42 home runs and stealing 40 bases. After that, the street in front of his former high school was named after him and later rescinded in 2008 after he admitted to previously using drugs throughout his career.34 That same year, he helped the Athletics to the World Series but they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games. Canseco was unanimously named the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1988, with a .307 batting average, 120 runs scored, 124 RBI, 42 home runs, and 40 stolen bases.
In , Canseco missed all but 65 of the regular season games with a broken wrist, but he still managed to hit 17 home runs as the Athletics won their first World Series since 1974, beating the San Francisco Giants in four games. The 1989 Series was interrupted before Game 3 by a major earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Canseco came back to form in , hitting 37 home runs despite being hampered in the latter part of the season by what would become a recurring back problem. The A's returned to the World Series once again, but were swept by the Cincinnati Reds in four games. Canseco continued to be productive, hitting 44 home runs in , but his career hit a plateau, and in the face of frequent injuries and controversy he never accomplished what many felt he was capable of.
Texas Rangers (1992&lt;U+2013&gt;94)
On August 31, , in the middle of a game and while he was in the on-deck circle, the A's traded Canseco to the Texas Rangers for Rub&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Sierra, Jeff Russell, and Bobby Witt.
On May 26, , during a game against the Cleveland Indians, Carlos Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;nez hit a fly ball that Canseco lost sight of as he was crossing the warning track. The ball hit him in the head and bounced over the wall for a home run.5 The cap6 Canseco was wearing on that play, which This Week in Baseball rated in 1998 as the greatest blooper of the show's first 21 years, is in the Seth Swirsky collection. After the incident, the Harrisburg Heat offered him a soccer contract.7 Three days later, Canseco asked his manager, Kevin Kennedy, to let him pitch the eighth inning of a runaway loss to the Boston Red Sox; he injured his arm, underwent Tommy John surgery, and was lost for the remainder of the season. In his pitching appearance, Canseco allowed three earned runs on two hits and three walks, throwing 33 pitches, but only 12 for strikes.8
In the 1994 strike shortened season, Canseco again returned to his former status of power hitter with 31 home runs and 90 RBI in 111 games. Canseco also stole 15 bases and posted a .282 batting average. He was named comeback player of the year in 1994, and finished in eleventh place in the American League Most Valuable Player voting.
Final MLB seasons (1995&lt;U+2013&gt;2001)
After playing with the Rangers from 1992 to 1994, Canseco moved on to play with the Boston Red Sox from 1995 to 1996. Following an unsuccessful return with the A's in , Canseco did have a productive season again with the Toronto Blue Jays in , when he hit 46 home runs and stole 29 bases, the most he had stolen since the 40 he stole in 1988. He won the AL Silver Slugger award, but his comeback was missed by most fans because of the home run race in the National League between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
Canseco went to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in , where he hit 34 home runs in 114 games and was named to the AL All-Star team, until he injured his back and was lost for the season. He was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees in August 2000, which caught many, including Yankees manager Joe Torre off guard, as the Yankees had four other players who fulfilled a similar role to Canseco.9 Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman made the claim to prevent the Blue Jays, who were in a close race with the Yankees, from acquiring Canseco.10 He made one appearance in the 2000 World Series against the New York Mets. Canseco later called his Yankees tenure &quot;the worst time of [his] life&quot; due to receiving limited playing time.11
Canseco played with the Chicago White Sox in , after being cut by the Anaheim Angels in spring training and spending half of the season with the Newark Bears of the independent Atlantic League. In , Canseco was signed by the Montreal Expos but was released prior to the regular season. Canseco retired in May 2002. He made a brief comeback attempt in , but was not offered a spot with the Los Angeles Dodgers after a spring tryout.
Awards
His 462 career home runs rank him 32nd on the MLB all-time list. Canseco was at one time the all-time leader in home runs among Latino players; he was later surpassed by Manny Ramirez, Carlos Delgado, Rafael Palmeiro, Alex Rodriguez, and Sammy Sosa. Canseco has been distinguished four times with the Silver Slugger award: three times as an AL outfielder in 1988, 1990, and 1991, and once as a Designated Hitter in 1998.
Independent League career (2006-present)
 On June 29, , the independent Golden Baseball League announced Canseco had agreed to a one-year contract to play with the San Diego Surf Dawgs. The League said Canseco had agreed to be subjected to its drug-testing policy &quot;that immediately expels any players found using steroids or illegal drugs.&quot;
On July 5, 2006, Canseco was traded to the Long Beach Armada after only one game. He requested the trade due to &quot;family obligations.&quot; On July 31, 2006, Canseco won the Golden Baseball League's Home Run Derby. Canseco signed a short team deal with the Laredo Broncos of the United Baseball League on August 14, 2010. He served as bench coach and designated hitter.12 On April 11, 2011, Canseco signed a deal as a player/manager for the Yuma Scorpions of the North American League.13
Canseco joined the Quintana Roo Tigres of the Mexican League in 2012, but was reportedly banned for using testosterone.14
Steroids
In 2005, Canseco admitted to using anabolic steroids with Jorge Delgado, Damaso Moreno and Manuel Collado in a tell-all book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits &amp; How Baseball Got Big. Canseco also claimed that up to 85% of major league players took steroids, a figure disputed by many in the game. In the book, Canseco specifically identified former teammates Mark McGwire, Rafael Palmeiro, Jason Giambi, Iv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Rodr&lt;U+00ED&gt;guez and Juan Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez as fellow steroid users, and admitted that he injected them.15 Most of the players named in the book initially denied steroid use, though Giambi admitted to steroid use in testimony before a grand jury investigating the BALCO case and on January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted publicly to using steroids.
At a Congressional hearing on the subject of steroids in sports, Palmeiro categorically denied using performance-enhancing drugs, while McGwire repeatedly and somewhat conspicuously refused to answer questions on his own suspected use, saying he &quot;didn't want to talk about the past.&quot; Canseco's book became a New York Times bestseller. On August 1, 2005, Palmeiro was suspended for 10 days by Major League Baseball after testing positive for steroids.
On December 13, 2007, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Canseco and Jorge Delgado were cited in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball.16 On December 20, 2007, Canseco was also named in Jason Grimsley's unsealed affidavit as a user of steroids. Canseco and Grimsley were teammates on the 2000 New York Yankees.17
On December 30, 2007, it was announced that Canseco has reached a deal for his sequel to Juiced. The new book is Vindicated, which Canseco's lawyer, Robert Saunooke, said would hit bookstores by Opening Day 2008. This book is said to have &quot;stuff&quot; on Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Belle as suggested by Canseco. The book will be a &quot;clarification&quot; of names that should've been mentioned in the Mitchell Report. On January 5, 2008, a potential editor for his upcoming book, Don Yaeger, a former Sports Illustrated associate editor, said he would not edit the book. He told the New York Daily News that he thought Canseco didn't have a book in the material he gave him. However, on February 7, 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that A-Rod did test positive during his 2003 season, which could make Canseco's book seem more real than it was believed.18 Finally, on Monday, February 9, 2009 A-Rod confirmed Canseco's previous allegations of steroids use in an exclusive interview; A-Rod admits to using steroids from 2001 to 2003. However, Rodriguez denied the allegations written in Canseco's book that Canseco introduced him to a steroid deal, calling that information &quot;100% false&quot;.

In , he received 6 Hall of Fame votes. This accounted for 1.1% of the ballots, failing to reach the 5% threshold necessary to stay on the ballot for another year. However, he can be elected to the Hall of Fame by the Committee of Baseball Veterans.
In May 2008, Philadelphia sportscaster and former NFL football player Vai Sikahema accepted a challenge from Canseco to fight him for $30,000. Canseco claims to have earned black belts in Kung Fu and Taekwondo, while Sikahema fought in the Golden Gloves tournament won by Sugar Ray Leonard. The fight took place on July 12 in Atlantic City at the Bernie Robbins stadium.21 The  Sikahema knocked out the  Canseco in the first round.
