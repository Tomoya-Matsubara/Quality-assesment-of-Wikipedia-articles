The Colin Archer Peninsula is located on the northwestern Devon Island, a part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of the Canadian territory of Nunavut. It stretches eastward into Baffin Bay.
Cape Vera, at the eastern end of the peninsula, has been designated as an International Biological Programme site, and has been identified as a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site by the Canadian Wildlife Service. The cape includes a high coastal cliff, grassy to bare-rock cliff ledges, and a talus beach. The cliffs are a breeding site for the Northern Fulmar.1
The peninsula is frequented by wintering Bearded seals, Ringed seals, polar bears, and walrus.
