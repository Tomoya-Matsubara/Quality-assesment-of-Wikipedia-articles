Karl Heinrich Marx (5 May 1818 &lt;U+2013&gt; 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, sociologist, economic historian, journalist, and revolutionary socialist who developed the socio-political theory of Marxism. His ideas have since played a significant role in the development of social science and the socialist political movement. He published various books during his lifetime, with the most notable being The Communist Manifesto (1848) and Capital (1867&lt;U+2013&gt;1894), many of which were co-written with his friend, the fellow German revolutionary socialist Friedrich Engels.1
Born into a wealthy middle class family in Trier, Prussia, Marx went on to study at both the University of Bonn and the University of Berlin, where he became interested in the philosophical ideas of the Young Hegelians. In 1836, he became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, marrying her in 1843. Following the completion of his studies, he became a journalist in Cologne, writing for a radical newspaper, the Rheinische Zeitung, where he began to use Hegelian concepts of dialectical materialism to influence his ideas on socialism. Moving to Paris in 1843, he began writing for other radical newspapers, the Deutsch-Franz&lt;U+00F6&gt;sische Jahrb&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher and Vorw&lt;U+00E4&gt;rts!, as well as writing a series of books, several of which were co-written with Engels. Exiled to Brussels in Belgium in 1845, he became a leading figure of the Communist League, before moving back to Cologne, where he founded his own newspaper, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung. Exiled once more, in 1849 he moved to London together with his wife Jenny and their children. In London, where the family was reduced to poverty, Marx continued writing and formulating his theories about the nature of society and how he believed it could be improved, as well as campaigning for socialism and becoming a significant figure in the International Workingmen's Association.
Marx's theories about society, economics and politics, which are collectively known as Marxism, hold that all societies progress through the dialectic of class struggle. He was heavily critical of the current socio-economic form of society, capitalism, which he called the &quot;dictatorship of the bourgeoisie&quot;, believing it to be run by the wealthy middle and upper classes purely for their own benefit, and predicted that, like previous socioeconomic systems, it would inevitably produce internal tensions which would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system, socialism.2 Under socialism, he argued that society would be governed by the working class in what he called the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;, the &quot;workers state&quot; or &quot;workers' democracy&quot;.34 He believed that socialism would, in its turn, eventually be replaced by a stateless, classless society called pure communism. Along with believing in the inevitability of socialism and communism, Marx actively fought for the former's implementation, arguing that both social theorists and underprivileged people should carry out organised revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic change.56
While Marx remained a relatively unknown figure in his own lifetime, his ideas and the ideology of Marxism began to exert a major influence on socialist movements shortly after his death. Revolutionary socialist governments following Marxist concepts took power in a variety of countries in the 20th century, leading to the formation of such socialist states as the Soviet Union in 1922 and the People's Republic of China in 1949, whilst various theoretical variants, such as Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism and Maoism, were developed. Marx is typically cited, with &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Durkheim and Max Weber, as one of the three principal architects of modern social science.7 Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and in a 1999 BBC poll was voted the &quot;thinker of the millennium&quot; by people from around the world.89
Biography
Early life: 1818&lt;U+2013&gt;1835
Marx's birthplace in Trier, Rhineland-Palatinate, which is now a museum devoted to him.
Karl Heinrich Marx was born on 5 May 1818 at 664 Br&lt;U+00FC&gt;ckergasse in Trier, a town located in the Kingdom of Prussia's Province of the Lower Rhine.10 His ancestry was Jewish, with his paternal line having supplied the rabbis of Trier since 1723, a role that had been taken up by his own grandfather, Merier Halevi Marx; Merier's son and Karl's father would be the first in the line to receive a secular education.11 His maternal grandfather was a Dutch rabbi.12 Karl's father, Hirschel Marx, was middle-class and relatively prosperous, owning a number of Moselle vineyards; he converted from Judaism to the Protestant Christian denomination of Lutheranism prior to his son's birth, taking on the German forename of Heinrich over Hirschel.13 In 1815, he began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved his family from a five-room rented apartment into a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra.14 A man of the Enlightenment, Heinrich Marx was interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire, and took part in agitations for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, which was then governed by an absolute monarchy.15 Karl's mother, born Henrietta Pressburg, was a Dutch Jew who, unlike her husband, was only semi-literate. She claimed to suffer from &quot;excessive mother love&quot;, devoting much time to her family, and insisting on cleanliness within her home.16 She was from a prosperous business family. Her family later founded the company Philips Electronics: she was great-aunt to Anton and Gerard Philips, and great-great-aunt to Frits Philips.17
Little is known about Karl Marx's childhood.18 He was privately educated until 1830, when he entered Trier High School, which was then run by the headmaster Hugo Wyttenbach, a friend of his father. Wyttenbach had employed many liberal humanists as teachers, something which angered the government, and so the police raided the school in 1832, discovering what they labelled seditious literature espousing political liberalism being distributed amongst the students.19 In 1835, Karl, then aged seventeen, began attending the University of Bonn, where he wished to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field of study.20 He was able to avoid military service when he turned eighteen because he suffered from a weak chest.21 Being fond of alcoholic beverages, at Bonn he joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (Landsmannschaft der Treveraner) and at one point served as its co-president.22 Marx was more interested in drinking and socialising than studying law, and due to his poor grades, his father forced him to transfer to the far more serious and academically oriented University of Berlin,23 where his legal studies became less significant than excursions into philosophy and history.24
Hegelianism and early activism: 1836&lt;U+2013&gt;1843
In 1836, Marx became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, a beautiful baroness of the Prussian ruling class--&quot;the most desirable young women in Trier&quot; 25 --who broke off her engagement with a young aristocratic second lieutenant in order to be with him.26 Their eventual marriage was controversial for breaking three social taboos of the period; it was a marriage between a daughter of a noble background and a man of Jewish origin as well as being between individuals who belonged to the middle and upper class (aristocracy), respectively, and between a man and an older woman. Such issues were lessened by Marx's friendship with Jenny's father, Baron Ludwig von Westphalen, a liberal thinking aristocrat. Marx dedicated his doctoral thesis to him.27 The couple married seven years later, on 19 June 1843, at the Pauluskirche in Bad Kreuznach.28
Marx became interested in, but critical of, the work of the German philosopher G.W.F Hegel (1770&lt;U+2013&gt;1831), whose ideas were widely debated amongst European philosophical circles at the time.29 Marx wrote about falling ill &quot;from intense vexation at having to make an idol of a view I detested.&quot;30 He became involved with a group of radical thinkers known as the Young Hegelians, who gathered around Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer.31 Like Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's metaphysical assumptions, but still adopted his dialectical method in order to criticise established society, politics and religion. Marx befriended Bauer, and in July 1841 the two scandalised their class in Bonn by getting drunk, laughing in church, and galloping through the streets on donkeys.32 During that period, Marx concentrated on his criticism of Hegel and certain other Young Hegelians.33

Marx also wrote for his own enjoyment, writing both non-fiction and fiction. In 1837, he completed a short novel, Scorpion and Felix; a drama, Oulanem; and some poems; none of which were published.34 In 1971, Marx's one act play Oulanem was made available in English by author Robert Payne. According to Payne, the title Oulanem is an anagram for &quot;Manuelo&quot; which is a variant of &quot;Emmanuel&quot; meaning &quot;God is with us&quot;.35 He soon gave up writing fiction for other pursuits, including learning English and Italian.36
He was deeply engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature, which he finished in 1841. The essay has been described as &quot;a daring and original piece of work in which he set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy&quot;,37 and as such was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided to submit it instead to the more liberal University of Jena, whose faculty awarded him his PhD based on it.3839
From considering an academic career, Marx turned to journalism.4041 He moved to the city of Cologne in 1842, where he began writing for the radical newspaper Rheinische Zeitung, where he expressed his increasingly socialist views on politics.42 He criticised the governments of Europe and their policies, but also liberals and other members of the socialist movement whose ideas he thought were ineffective or outright anti-socialist.43 The paper eventually attracted the attention of the Prussian government censors, who checked every issue for potentially seditious material before it could be printed. Marx said, &quot;Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the newspaper is not allowed to appear.&quot;44 After the paper published an article strongly criticising the monarchy in Russia, the Russian Tsar Nicholas I, an ally of the Prussian monarchy, requested that the Rheinische Zeitung be banned. The Prussian government shut down the paper in 1843.45 Marx wrote for the Young Hegelian journal, the Deutsche Jahrb&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher, in which he criticised the censorship instructions issued by Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. His article was censored and the newspaper closed down by the authorities shortly after.46
In 1843, Marx published On the Jewish Question, in which he distinguished between political and human emancipation. He also examined the role of religious practice in society.47 That same year he published Contribution to Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, in which he dealt more substantively with religion, describing it as &quot;the opiate of the people&quot;.48 He completed both works shortly before leaving Cologne.49
Paris: 1843&lt;U+2013&gt;1845
Following the government-imposed shutdown of the Rheinische Zeitung, Marx got involved with a new radical newspaper, the Deutsch-Franz&lt;U+00F6&gt;sische Jahrb&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher (German-French Annals), which was then being set up by Arnold Ruge, another German socialist revolutionary.50 The paper was based not in Germany, but in the city of Paris in neighbouring France, and it was here that both Marx and his wife moved in October 1843. They initially lived with Ruge and his wife communally at 23 Rue Vaneau, but finding these living conditions difficult, the Marxes moved out following the birth of their daughter Jenny in 1844.51 Although it was intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the Deutsch-Franz&lt;U+00F6&gt;sische Jahrb&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher was dominated by the latter, with the only non-German writer being the exiled Russian anarcho-communist Michael Bakunin.52 Only one issue was ever published, but it was relatively successful, largely due to the inclusion of Heinrich Heine's satirical odes on King Ludwig of Bavaria, which led to those copies sent to Germany being confiscated by the state's police force.53
It was in Paris that, on 28 August 1844, Marx met German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; de la R&lt;U+00E9&gt;gence after becoming interested in the ideas that the latter had expressed in articles written for the Rheinische Zeitung and the Deutsch-Franz&lt;U+00F6&gt;sische Jahrb&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher. Although they had briefly met each other at the offices of the Rheinische Zeitung in 1842, it was here in Paris that they began their friendship that would last for the rest of their lives.54 Engels showed Marx his recently published book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844,55 which convinced Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.56 Engels and Marx soon set about writing a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, the Young Hegelian Bruno Bauer, which would be published in 1845 as The Holy Family.57 Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the other Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually also abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.58
In 1844 Marx wrote The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, a work which covered numerous topics, and went into detail to explain Marx's concept of alienated labour.59 A year later Marx would write Theses on Feuerbach, best known for the statement that &quot;the philosophers have only interpreted the world, the point is to change it&quot;.60 This work contains Marx's criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory) and overall, criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world.61 It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx's historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.6263
After the collapse of the Deutsch-Franz&lt;U+00F6&gt;sische Jahrb&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher, Marx, still living on the Rue Vaneau, began writing for what was then the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper in Europe, Vorw&lt;U+00E4&gt;rts!.64 Based in Paris, the paper had been established and was run by many activists connected to the revolutionary socialist League of the Just, which would come to be better known as the Communist League within a few years.6566 In Vorw&lt;U+00E4&gt;rts!, Marx continued to refine his views on socialism based upon the Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, whilst at the same time criticising various liberals and other socialists operating in Europe at the time.67 However in 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the French government agreed to shut down Vorw&lt;U+00E4&gt;rts!, and furthermore, Marx himself was expelled from France by the interior minister Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Guizot.68
Brussels: 1845&lt;U+2013&gt;1847
The first edition of The Manifesto of the Communist Party, published in German in 1848
Unable either to stay in France or move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium, but had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics in order to enter.69 In Brussels, he associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer, and soon Engels moved to the city in order to join them.70 In 1845 Marx and Engels visited the leaders of the Chartists, a socialist movement in Britain, using the trip as an opportunity to study in various libraries in London and Manchester.71 In collaboration with Engels he also set about writing a book which is often seen as his best treatment of the concept of historical materialism, The German Ideology; the work, like many others, would not see publication in Marx's lifetime, only being published in 1932.727374 He followed this with The Poverty of Philosophy (1847), a response to the French anarcho-socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's The Philosophy of Poverty and a critique of French socialist thought in general.75
These books laid the foundation for Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as The Communist Manifesto. First published on 21 February 1848, it laid out the beliefs of the Communist League, a group who had come increasingly under the influence of Marx and Engels, who argued that the League must make their aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding them as they had formerly been doing.76 The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Marxism, that &quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.&quot;77 It goes on to look at the antagonisms that Marx claimed were arising between the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie (the wealthy middle class) and the proletariat (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, the Manifesto presents the argument for why the Communist League, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and replace it with socialism.78
Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals, the Revolutions of 1848.79 In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic.80 Marx was supportive of such activity, and having recently received a substantial inheritance from his father of either 600081 or 5000 francs,8283 allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.84 Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,8586 the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused him of it, subsequently arresting him, and he was forced to flee back to France, where, with a new republican government in power, he believed that he would be safe.8788
Cologne: 1848-1849
Temporarily settling down in Paris, Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to the city and also set up a German Workers' Club with various German socialists living there.89 Hoping to see the revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Marx moved back to Cologne where he began issuing a handbill entitled the Demands of the Communist Party in Germany, in which he argued for only four of the ten points of the Communist Manifesto, believing that in Germany at that time, the bourgeoisie must overthrow the feudal monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.90 On 1 June, Marx started publication of the daily Neue Rheinische Zeitung (&quot;New Rhenish Newspaper&quot;), which he helped to finance through his recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with his own Marxist interpretation of events, Marx remained one of its primary writers, accompanied by other fellow members of the Communist League who wrote for the paper, although despite their input it remained, according to Friedrich Engels, &quot;a simple dictatorship by Marx&quot;, who dominated the choice of content.919293
Whilst editor of the paper, Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police, and Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, an alleged press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting,9495969798 although each time he was acquitted.99100 Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed, and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of his reactionary supporters, who implemented counter-revolutionary measures to expunge leftist and other revolutionary elements from the country.101 As a part of this, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was soon suppressed and Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May.102103 Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counter-revolution and a cholera epidemic, and was soon expelled by the city authorities who considered him a political threat. With his wife Jenny expecting their fourth child, and not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London.104105
London: 1849&lt;U+2013&gt;1883
 Marx moved to London in May 1849 and would remain in the city for the rest of his life. It was here that he founded the new headquarters of the Communist League, and got heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society, who held their meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district.106107 Marx devoted himself to two activities: revolutionary organising, and an attempt to understand political economy and capitalism. For the first few years he and his family lived in extreme poverty.108109 His main source of income was his colleague, Engels, who derived much of his income from his family's business.110 Marx also briefly worked as correspondent for the New York Tribune in 1851.111
From December 1851 to March 1852 Marx wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, a work on the French Revolution of 1848, in which he expanded upon his concepts of historical materialism, class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the argument that victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.112
The 1850s and 1860s also marks the line between what some scholars see as idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically-minded mature Marx writings of the later period.113114115116 This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school.117 Nor do all scholars agree that it indeed exists.118119
In 1864 Marx became involved in the International Workingmen's Association (also known as First International).120 He became a leader of its General Council, to whose General Council he was elected at its inception in 1864.121 In that organisation Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred around Mikhail Bakunin (1814&lt;U+2013&gt;1876).122 Although Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.123 The most important political event during the existence of the International was the Paris Commune of 1871 when the citizens of Paris rebelled against their government and held the city for two months. On the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Marx wrote one of his most famous pamphlets, The Civil War in France, a defense of the Commune.124
Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx also sought to understand capitalism, and spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data.125 By 1857 he had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state, foreign trade and the world market; this work did not appear in print until 1941, under the title Grundrisse.126127 In 1859, Marx published Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, his first serious economic work. In the early 1860s he worked on composing three large volumes, the Theories of Surplus Value, which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly Adam Smith and David Ricardo.128 This work is often seen as the fourth book of Capital, and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the history of economic thought.129 In 1867 the first volume of Capital was published, a work which analyzed the capitalist process of production.130 Here, Marx elaborated his labour theory of value and his conception of surplus value and exploitation which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism.131 Volumes II and III remained mere manuscripts upon which Marx continued to work for the rest of his life and were published posthumously by Engels.132
 During the last decade of his life, Marx's health declined and he became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.133 He did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. His Critique of the Gotha Programme opposed the tendency of his followers Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel to compromise with the state socialism of Ferdinand Lassalle in the interests of a united socialist party.134 This work is also notable for another famous Marx's quote: &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&quot;135
In a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Marx even contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village mir.136137 While admitting that Russia's rural &quot;commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia&quot;, Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage, it &quot;would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it (the rural commune) from all sides.&quot;138 Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Marx allowed, that &quot;normal conditions of spontaneous development&quot; of the rural commune could exist.139 However, in the same letter to Vera Zaulich, Marx points out that &quot;at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production.&quot;140 In one of the drafts of this letter, Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology, motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. He wrote that 'the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak, a crisis that will end in its destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type &lt;U+2014&gt; collective production and appropriation'. He added that 'the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies'.141 Before he died, Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.
Death
 Following the death of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx developed a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883. He died a stateless person;142 family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery, London, on 17 March 1883. There were between nine to eleven mourners at his funeral.143144145
Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including Wilhelm Liebknecht and Friedrich Engels. Engels's speech included the passage:  Marx's daughter Eleanor and Charles Longuet and Paul Lafargue, Marx's two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance.146 Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social-Democratic Party, gave a speech in German, and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French.147 Two telegrams from workers' parties in France and Spain were also read out.148 Together with Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral.149 Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne communist trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as &quot;an old member of the Communist League&quot; and Carl Schorlemmer, a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the Royal Society, and a communist activist involved in the 1848 Baden revolution.150 Another attendee of the funeral was Ray Lankester, a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.151
Upon his own death, Engels left Marx's two surviving daughters a significant portion&quot; of his $4.8 million estate. 152
Marx's tombstone bears the carved message: &quot;WORKERS OF ALL LANDS UNITE&quot;, the final line of The Communist Manifesto, and from the 11th Thesis on Feuerbach (edited by Engels): &quot;The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways&lt;U+2014&gt;the point however is to change it&quot;.153 The Communist Party of Great Britain had the monumental tombstone built in 1954 with a portrait bust by Laurence Bradshaw; Marx's original tomb had had only humble adornment.154 In 1970 there was an unsuccessful attempt to destroy the monument using a homemade bomb.155156
The later Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm remarked that &quot;One cannot say Marx died a failure&quot; because, although he had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, his writings had already begun to make an impact on the leftist movements in Germany and Russia. Within 25 years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Marx's influence on their politics were each gaining between 15 and 47% in those countries with representative democratic elections.157
Marx's thought
Inspirations
Marx's thought demonstrates influences from many thinkers, including but not limited to:
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's philosophy;158
The classical political economy (economics) of Adam Smith and David Ricardo;159
French socialist thought,160 in particular the thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Henri de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier;161162
Earlier German philosophical materialism, particularly that of Ludwig Feuerbach;163
The working class analysis by Friedrich Engels.164
Marx's view of history, which came to be called historical materialism (controversially adapted as the philosophy of dialectical materialism by Engels and Lenin) certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) dialectically.165 However, Hegel had thought in idealist terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.166167 Where Hegel saw the &quot;spirit&quot; as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world.168 He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet.169
Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,170 Marx criticised utopian socialists, arguing that their favoured small scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty, and that only a large scale change in the economic system can bring about real change.171
The other important contribution to Marx's revision of Hegelianism came from Engels's book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which led Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution.172
Marx believed that he could study history and society scientifically and discern tendencies of history and the resulting outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Marx concluded, therefore, that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of his Theses on Feuerbach that &quot;philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change it&quot;, and he clearly dedicated himself to trying to alter the world.173174
Philosophy and social thought
Marx polemic with other thinkers often occurred through critique, and thus he has been called &quot;the first great user of critical method in social sciences.&quot;175176 He criticised speculative philosophy, equating metaphysics with ideology.177 By adopting this approach, Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.178 This set him apart from many contemporary philosophers.179
Human nature
Fundamentally, Marx assumed that human history involves transforming human nature, which encompasses both human beings and material objects.180 Humans recognise that they possess both actual and potential selves.181182 For both Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal alienation stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a subjective agent, renders its potential counterpart an object to be apprehended.183 Marx further argues that, by molding nature184 in desired ways,185 the subject takes the object as its own, and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human. For Marx, then, human nature&lt;U+2014&gt;Gattungswesen, or species-being&lt;U+2014&gt;exists as a function of human labour.186187188 Fundamental to Marx's idea of meaningful labour is the proposition that, in order for a subject to come to terms with its alienated object, it must first exert influence upon literal, material objects in the subject's world.189 Marx acknowledges that Hegel &quot;grasps the nature of work and comprehends objective man, authentic because actual, as the result of his own work&quot;,190 but characterises Hegelian self-development as unduly &quot;spiritual&quot; and abstract.191 Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that &quot;the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that he has actual, sensuous objects for his nature as objects of his life-expression, or that he can only express his life in actual sensuous objects.&quot;192 Consequently, Marx revises Hegelian &quot;work&quot; into material &quot;labour&quot;, and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term &quot;labour power&quot;.193
Labour, class struggle and false consciousness
Marx had a special concern with how people relate to that most fundamental resource of all, their own labour power.194 He wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of alienation.sz&lt;U+00E1&gt;ros2006&quot;/&gt; As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.195 Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.196 For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour&lt;U+2014&gt;one's capacity to transform the world&lt;U+2014&gt;is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature; it is a spiritual loss.197 Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behavior merely adapt.198
Commodity fetishism provides an example of what Engels called &quot;false consciousness&quot;,199 which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By &quot;ideology&quot;, Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.200 Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths; they serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production includes not only the production of food or manufactured goods; it includes the production of ideas as well (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to their own interests).201202 An example of this sort of analysis is Marx's understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface203 to his 1843 Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right:
Whereas his Gymnasium senior thesis argued that religion had as its primary social aim the promotion of solidarity, here Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic status quo and inequality.204
Economy, history and society
Marx thoughts on labour were related to the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism).205206207 Accumulation of capital shapes the social system.208 Social change, for Marx, was about conflict between opposing interests, driven, in the background, by economic forces.209 This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory.210 In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.211 Marx noted that this was not an intentional process; rather, no individual or even no state can go against the forces of economy.212
The organisation of society depends on means of production. Literally those things, like land, natural resources, and technology, necessary for the production of material goods and the relations of production, in other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production.213 Together these compose the mode of production, and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system, and superstructure, to the cultural and political system.214 Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.215
Despite Marx's stress on critique of capitalism and discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, as he saw it as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal).216 Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.217
 Marx's view of capitalism was two sided.218219 On one hand, Marx, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system, noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical depressions leading to mass unemployment; on the other hand capitalism is also characterised by &quot;revolutionizing, industrializing and universalizing qualities of development, growth and progressivity&quot; (by which Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, technological progress, increased productivity and growth, rationality and scientific revolution), that are responsible for progress.220221222 Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history, because it constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history, and was responsible for the overthrow of feudalism and its transition to capitalism.223224 Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist can, and has an incentive to, reinvest profits in new technologies and capital equipment.225
According to Marx capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference &quot;surplus value&quot; and argued that this surplus value had its source in surplus labour, the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce.226 Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as to vampires sucking worker's blood, but at the same time,227 he notes that drawing profit is &quot;by no means an injustice&quot;228 and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system.229 The true problem lies with the &quot;cancerous cell&quot; of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners &lt;U+2013&gt; the economic system in general.230
At the same time, Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable, and prone to periodic crises.231 He suggested that over time, capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies, and less and less in labour.232 Since Marx believed that surplus value appropriated from labour is the source of profits, he concluded that the rate of profit would fall even as the economy grew.233 Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this cycle of growth, collapse, and more growth.234 Moreover, he believed that in the long-term this process would necessarily enrich and empower the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.235236 In section one of The Communist Manifesto Marx describes feudalism, capitalism, and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process: 
Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society: 
Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop a class consciousness, in time realising that they have to change the system.237238 Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class, and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.239 Marx argued that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class:
In this new society the self-alienation would end, and humans would be free to act without being bound by the labour market.240 It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.241 In such a utopian world there would also be little if any need for a state, which goal was to enforce the alienation.242 He theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, a dictatorship of the proletariat&lt;U+2014&gt;a period where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production&lt;U+2014&gt;would exist.243 As he wrote in his &quot;Critique of the Gotha Program&quot;, &quot;between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;244 While he allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the US and the Netherlands), he suggested that in other countries with strong centralised state-oriented traditions, like France and Germany, the &quot;lever of our revolution must be force.&quot;245
Personal life
 Marx married Jenny von Westphalen in 1843. Together had seven children, but partly due to the poor living conditions they were forced to live in whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood.246 The children were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844&lt;U+2013&gt;83); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845&lt;U+2013&gt;1911); Edgar (1847&lt;U+2013&gt;1855); Henry Edward Guy (&quot;Guido&quot;; 1849&lt;U+2013&gt;1850); Jenny Eveline Frances (&quot;Franziska&quot;; 1851&lt;U+2013&gt;52); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855&lt;U+2013&gt;98) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). There are allegations that Marx also fathered a son, Freddy,247 out of wedlock by his housekeeper, Helene Demuth.248
Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track him down. Whilst in Paris, he used that of 'Monsieur Ramboz', whilst in London he signed off his letters as 'A. Williams'. His friends referred to him as 'Moor', due to his dark complexion and black curly hair, something which they believed made him resemble the historical Moors of North Africa, whilst he encouraged his children to call him 'Old Nick' and 'Charley'.249 He also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on his friends and family as well, referring to Friedrich Engels as 'General', his housekeeper Helene as 'Lenchen' or 'Nym', whilst one of his daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as 'Qui Qui, Emperor of China' and another, Laura, was known as 'Kakadou' or 'the Hottentot'.250 Italic text
Legacy
Widespread influence
 Marx has widely been thought of as one of the most influential thinkers in history, who has had a significant influence on both world politics and intellectual thought.251 Marx's biographer Francis Wheen considered the &quot;history of the twentieth century&quot; to be &quot;Marx's legacy&quot;,252 whilst Australian philosopher Peter Singer believed that Marx's impact could be compared with that of the founders of the two major world religions, Jesus Christ and Muhammad.253 Singer noted that &quot;Marx's ideas brought about modern sociology, transformed the study of history, and profoundly affected philosophy, literature and the arts.&quot;254 Stokes said that Marx's ideas led to him becoming &quot;the darling of both European and American intellectuals up until the 1960s&quot;,255 and have influenced a wide variety of disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology,256 media studies,257 political science, theater, history, sociological theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology, and philosophy.258
In July 2005, 27.9% of listeners in a BBC Radio 4 series In Our Time poll selected Marx as their favorite thinker.259
The reasons for Marx's widespread influence revolve around his ethical message; a &quot;morally empowering language of critique&quot; against the dominant capitalist society.260 No other body of work was so relevant to the modern times, and at the same time, so outspoken about the need for change.261 In the political realm, Marx's ideas led to the establishment of governments using Marxist thought to replace capitalism with communism or socialism (or augment it with market socialism) across much of the world, whilst his intellectual thought has heavily influenced the academic study of the humanities and the arts.
Marxism
Followers of Marx have drawn on his work to propose grand, cohesive theoretical outlooks dubbed &quot;Marxism&quot;. This body of works has had significant influence on the both political and scientific scenes.262 Nevertheless, Marxists have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and how to apply his concepts to their contemporary events and conditions.263 The legacy of Marx's thought has become bitterly contested between numerous tendencies which each see themselves as Marx's most accurate interpreters, including (but not limited to) Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism, and libertarian Marxism.264 In academic Marxism, various currents have developed as well, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, Analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.265
Moreover, one should distinguish between &quot;Marxism&quot; and &quot;what Marx believed&quot;; for example, shortly before he died in 1883, Marx wrote a letter to the French workers' leader Jules Guesde, and to his own son-in-law Paul Lafargue, accusing them of &quot;revolutionary phrase-mongering&quot; and of lack of faith in the working class. After the French party split into a reformist and revolutionary party, some accused Guesde (leader of the latter) of taking orders from Marx; Marx remarked to Lafargue, &quot;if that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist&quot; (in a letter to Engels, Marx later accused Guesde of being a &quot;Bakuninist&quot;).266
Founder of social science
Marx is typically cited, along with &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Durkheim and Max Weber, as one of the three principal architects of modern social science.267 In contrast to philosophers, Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method.268 Both Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Whilst Marx, working in the Hegelian tradition, rejected Comtean sociological positivism, in attempting to develop a science of society he nevertheless came to be recognised as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning.269 In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. For Isaiah Berlin, Marx may be regarded as the &quot;true father&quot; of modern sociology, &quot;in so far as anyone can claim the title.&quot;270
Criticism
Predictions and theories
While many Marxist concepts are still of importance for modern social science, some specific predictions Marx made have been shown to be unlikely.271 Marx is often criticised for expecting a wave of socialist revolutions, originating in the most highly industrialised countries,272 to overturn capitalism. However others, pointing to Marx's encounter with late 19th-century Russian populism and Marx and Engels' preface to the second Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1882), have argued that Marx evinced a growing conviction in his late writings that revolution could in fact emerge first in Russia.273 Marx predicted the eventual fall of capitalism, to be replaced by socialism, yet since the late 20th century state socialism is in retreat, as the Soviet Union collapsed, and the People's Republic of China shifted towards a market economy.274 Additionally, his argument that profits are generated only through surplus labour has been challenged by the counterclaim that profits also come from investments in human capital and technology.275 Marx predicted that over time, inequality would grow (correctly276) but also that this would mean growing impoverishment of the growing worker class, increasingly exploited by the capitalists.277 The latter has not borne true, as in the developed world, through liberal reforms, trade unions won many concessions, improving the situation of the workers (something that Marx considered very unlikely). The working class is also growing smaller, as the industrial sector is replaced by the service sector, and worldwide poverty has decreased since the end of the 19th century.278279280281 (It should be noted that scholars have debated whether Marx's comments about the proletariat can be analyzed in the context of the working class).282 In addition to specific predictions, certain of Marx's theories, such as his labour theory of value, have also been criticised.283284 However, in the wake of the economic crisis of 2008 some thinkers like Terry Eagleton, David Harvey, and David McNally have given renewed impetus to the debate on whether Marx was right that capitalism inherently tends towards crisis (which Marx discussed as the &quot;contradictions of capital&quot;).285
Marxism as the ideology of totalitarian states
100 Mark der DDR note used in the German Democratic Republic. 100-Mark banknotes with Marx's portrait circulated from 1964 until monetary union with West Germany in July 1990.
While Marxist thought may be used to empower marginalised and dispossessed people, it has also been used to prop up governments who have utilised violence to remove those seen as impeding the revolution.286287 In some instances, his ultimate goals have been used as justification for the end justifies the means logic.288 Moreover, contrary to his goal, his ideas have been used to promote dogmatism and intolerance.289 Polish historian Andrzej Walicki noted that Marx's and Engels's theory was the &quot;theory of freedom&quot;, but a theory that, at the height of its influence, was used to legitimise the totalitarian socialist state of the Soviet Union.290 This abuse of Marx's thought is perhaps most clearly exemplified in Stalinist Marxism, described by critics as the &quot;most widespread and successful form of mass indoctrination... a masterly achievement in transforming Marxism into the official ideology of a consistently totalitarian state.&quot;291 The controversy is further fueled as some left-wing theorists have tried to shield Marxism from any connection to the Soviet regime.292 Lastly, the undue focus on the Marxist thought in the former Eastern Bloc, often forbidding social science arguments from outside the Marxist perspective,293294 led to a backlash against Marxism after the revolutions of 1989. In one example, references to Marx drastically decreased in Polish sociology after the fall of the revolutionary socialist governments, and two major research institutions which advocated the Marxist approach to sociology were closed.295

This being the case, we must also recognise the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must some day appeal to erect the rule of labour.&quot; La Libert&lt;U+00E9&gt; Speech delivered by Karl Marx on 8 September 1872, in Amsterdam↩
