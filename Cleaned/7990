&quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows (Interlude)&quot; (commonly referred to as only &quot;LoveStoned&quot;) is a song by American singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake from his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006). It was released on June 14, 2007 by Jive Records as the fifth single from the album. The song was co-written and produced by Timberlake, Timbaland, and Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills.
In contrast to the album's theme about sexual innuendos with themes of love, &quot;LoveStoned&quot; contains sexually suggestive lyrics. Musically &quot;LoveStoned&quot; is an upbeat dance song, while the interlude of &quot;I Think She Knows&quot; has a more slower, quiet, guitar-driven sound.1 Overall, the song also includes a string section. &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; was well-received by music critics, who noted the track's general sound and lyrics.
The track entered the top ten on most charts, topping several of Billboard magazine's component charts, including reaching the number one spot on the Hot Dance Club Play and Hot Dance Airplay charts, respectively. The international chart performance of the single failed to match its domestic success, never reaching the top spot. After its release, &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; was downloaded 39,000 times on iTunes. The song won Best Dance Recording at the 2008 Grammy Awards. The single has been widely sampled, with different covers and sounds.
Background
&quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; was written by Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, and Nate &quot;Danja&quot; Hills as a sexual love song.23 In an interview with MTV News, while promoting his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake revealed that the first half of the album generally focuses on sex. &quot;LoveStoned&quot; contains sexually suggestive lyrics, with the line, &quot;She's going home with me tonight&quot;.4
&quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; is a dance pop-R&amp;B song.5 The first part of the song, &quot;LoveStoned&quot;, starts off to &quot;a boast&quot; and the interlude &quot;I Think She Knows&quot; transitions into &quot;an adoring two-minute love song about someone special&quot;.6 The musicscape features string arrangements on both songs and also includes Timberlake's &quot;famous falsetto&quot;.7 In an interview with Rolling Stone, Timberlake admitted that the &quot;drony guitar interlude&quot; featured in &quot;I Think She Knows&quot; was inspired by the alternative rock band Interpol.8 The Guardian's Alexis Petridis in regards of &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows, noted the &quot;...slap-bass funk vanishes, in favour of vigorously strummed, vaguely Sonic Youth-ish guitars, luscious strings and a gorgeous Kraftwerk-inspired counter-melody&quot;.9 Martin Turenne of The Georgia Straight described &quot;LoveStoned&quot; as having &quot;a space-age disco track in which he [Timberlake] rhapsodizes about a statuesque goddess who casts a lustfully narcotic spell, leaving him defenceless against her predatory wiles&quot;.10 Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald reported that the song has a &quot;prowling funk&quot; sound.11 Jon Pareles of The New York Times also noted that the sound was similar of Michael Jackson's 1983 song &quot;Billie Jean&quot;.12 Pareles concluded that the track's &quot;pulsating guitar arrangement&quot; were those similar to U2.13
Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described the back story behind the song; Timberlake sees a &quot;gorgeous girl on the [dance] floor and longs to bring her back to the VIP Room and/or just cut to the chase and take her directly home&quot;.14 Dagny Salas of North by Northwestern commented that the lyrics &quot;She&lt;U+2019&gt;s got me love stoned/Man I swear she&lt;U+2019&gt;s bad and she knows&quot; are all about the dance floor prelude to the hookup.15 Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun said that FutureSex/LoveSounds is a &quot;bedroom&quot; album and included &quot;LoveStoned&quot; as part of it.16 Turenne concluded that the single is not just a song, &quot;its the start of an S&amp;M porno script&quot;.17
Reception
The song received positive reception from critics. In the Entertainment Weekly review of the album, critic Chris Willman wrote: &quot;Superior tracks, like 'LoveStoned' and 'What Comes Around', suggest a happy middle path, where Timberlake can equally embrace Timbaland's canny beats and his own vocal helium.&quot;18 Tim Finney of Pitchfork described the song as &quot;brilliantly ... tight, clipped disco funk&quot; and went onto say that it &quot;descends precipitously into the gorgeous melancholy of 'I Think That She Knows', all MOR-rock guitar churn and weightless strings, the same chorus ('She's got me love stoned...and I think that she knows') transformed from infatuation to the paranoid and elegiac admission of an addict&quot;.19 Lauren Murphy of Entertainment.ie noted &quot;LoveStoned&quot; as excellent and &quot;a sexy, layered affair with inspired violin intervals, and the consecutive interlude is a classy sliver of deftly-produced pop&quot;.20 Lucy Davies of the BBC wrote: &quot;'Lovestoned' is a great track, with chopping violins, beatboxing, and bongos. 'I Think She Knows', the interlude which follows, is quite beautiful, shimmering, and brilliantly constructed.&quot;21 Jonah Weiner of Blender wrote, &quot;From the grinding 'SexyBack' to the percolating 'LoveStoned' ... the vibe is all infectious, feverish build-up.&quot;22
In November 2007, musician John Mayer wrote in his blog that he very much preferred the interlude. &quot;Not so much for the 'LoveStoned' part, but for the 45 seconds of ultimate sonic bliss that is 'I Think She Knows'.&quot;23 Mayer went onto say that the song was Timberlake's &quot;breakthrough moment as an artist&quot; and complimented him on the musical style of the song.24 Upon its release, &quot;LoveStoned/I Think She Knows&quot; was downloaded 39,000 times on iTunes.25 At the 50th Grammy Awards, &quot;LoveStoned&quot; won a Grammy Award in the category of Best Dance Recording.2627 It was ranked at the number four spot on Entertainment Weekly's &quot;Best Songs of 2007&quot;.28 Timberlake performed the song live at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards.29
