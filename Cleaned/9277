Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr{{#tag:ref|His name is also sometimes referred to as Liotholfus,1 Liotolf,2 Li&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lf,3 Liotulf,4 Ljotolf,5 and Ljotulf.6|group=note}} is a minor character in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga, who is purported to have flourished in the mid-12th century. The Orkneyinga saga was compiled in about 1200, and documents the reigns of the earls of Orkney. It depicts Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr as a nobleman who lived on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. During the 12th century, the Hebrides formed part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.
The Orkneyinga saga relates how Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr was a friendly acquaintance of the Viking chieftain Sveinn &lt;U+00C1&gt;sleifarson, who is one of the major characters of the entire saga. The saga states that Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr housed Sveinn for some time on Lewis, and took in Sveinn's brother, who was banished from Orkney. Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr's son, Fugl, appears in the saga, although he is depicted at being at odds with Sveinn, until a relative of Fugl's negotiates peace between the two. Several historians have considered Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr to be an ancestor of Clan MacLeod; one of these considered Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr to be the eponymous ancestor of the clan—although the current understanding of the clan's ancestry regards another man as the eponym.
Background
Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr is a minor character in the Orkneyinga saga. He is purported to have flourished in the mid-12th century, and to have lived on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis. Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr has a son, Fugl, another minor character in the saga, who is also described as being from the island.{{#tag:ref|According to Aslak Liest&lt;U+00F8&gt;l in 1983, the name Fugl, in a West Norse context, is only found in this character, and in a runic inscription found in 1962 on the Inner Hebridean island of Iona.7 This inscription has been dated to the late 10th century, or 11th century.8 The name is also known in pre-Conquest England, and in mediaeval Danish and Swedish sources.9 The name originated as a byname derived from the Old West Norse fugl, which means &quot;fowl&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;.10 Historian Alan Orr Anderson noted in 1922, that the mediaeval Chronicle of Man records for the year 1183: &quot;Fogolt, the sheriff of Man, died&quot;. Anderson stated that it is possible that Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr's son was the mentioned sheriff.11 Later in 1937, Manx linguist John Joseph Kneen noted this sheriff, and two other instances of the name on the island, and stated that these names (Fogolt, Fogal) are derived from the Manx Gaelic Foghial, meaning &quot;under promise or pledge&quot;.12|group=note}}
Sources
The main source for Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr is the Orkneyinga saga, which was compiled sometime around 1200 by an unknown Icelander. The saga is thought to have been based upon poetry, oral tradition, and other written material. It can be summed up as an account of the lives of many of the earls of Orkney between the 9th and 13th centuries. According to research fellow Ian Beuermann, the saga is useful not for the specific events it describes, but rather for what it reveals about &quot;the ideas shaping the texts during the periods of composition or revision&quot;. For example, it is possible that even one of the main characters of the saga, Sveinn &lt;U+00C1&gt;sleifarson, never existed, or at least that the historical Sveinn differed from the saga's portrayal of him.13 Another source which mentions Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr is &lt;U+00DE&gt;orm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;ur Torfason's 17th-century Latin history of Orkney, which follows the Orkneyinga saga.
The Hebrides in the 12th century
Locations mentioned in the article 
In the 11th century, the earls of Orkney were at the height of their power. The Earl of Orkney, &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rfinnr Sigur&lt;U+00F0&gt;arson, also ruled Caithness and Sutherland, and seems to have controlled the western seaboard of Scotland, and the Hebrides.14 Historian Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s Stef&lt;U+00E1&gt;nsson described the political situation of the Hebrides and the Isle of Man during the 11th and early 12th century as being unstable, and suffering from the rivalries of petty kings and chieftains.15 In 1079, the Hebridean warlord Gofraidh Crobh&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was able to unite the Hebrides and the Isle of Man into an effective independent kingdom.16 In 1098–9, the Norwegian king Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s &lt;U+00D3&gt;l&lt;U+00E1&gt;fsson invaded the Hebrides, and asserted his right over the islands; he did so again in 1102–3. He is thought to have planned to unite Orkney, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Mann, under the control of his son.17 In 1103, Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s was slain in Ireland, and no Norwegian king set foot in the islands for over a century and a half.18 With Magn&lt;U+00FA&gt;s' death, the Outer Hebrides were brought back under the control of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles,19 whose kings tactfully recognised Norwegian sovereignty.20 In 1156, the kingdom was partitioned following an inconclusive sea battle between the warlord Somhairle mac Gille Brighde, and the Manx king Gofraidh mac Amhlaibh: the Outer Hebrides remained under the control of Gofraidh, but the Inner Hebrides were ruled separately by Somhairle. Two years later, Somhairle successfully invaded the Isle of Man, took the throne, and ruled the entire Kingdom of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1164.21
Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr in the Orkneyinga saga
One of the most prominent characters of the Orkneyinga saga is the Viking chieftain Sveinn &lt;U+00C1&gt;sleifarson, who lived on the island of Gairsay, in Orkney.22 The saga relates how Sveinn's father, &lt;U+00D3&gt;l&lt;U+00E1&gt;fr Hr&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfsson, was one of several chieftains who supported P&lt;U+00E1&gt;ll H&lt;U+00E1&gt;konsson, Earl of Orkney, in a victorious sea battle against a fleet led by &lt;U+00D6&gt;lvir R&lt;U+00F3&gt;sta in support of R&lt;U+00F6&gt;gnvaldr Kolsson,23 who had been appointed the earl of half of Orkney by the King of Norway.24{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson suggested the date of this battle to be 26 June 1136.25|group=note}} &lt;U+00D3&gt;l&lt;U+00E1&gt;fr was later burned to death inside his own house by &lt;U+00D6&gt;lvir,26 the grandson of Frak&lt;U+00F6&gt;kk, an ambitious woman, portrayed as a villain in the saga. Frak&lt;U+00F6&gt;kk attempted to win the Earldom of Orkney for her descendants—particularly &lt;U+00D6&gt;lvir.27
The saga relates how in Orkney, Sveinn murdered one of the earl's followers, and immediately fled to the Bishop of Orkney. The bishop protected Sveinn by sending him away to the Su&lt;U+00F0&gt;reyjar, into the care of Holdbo&lt;U+00F0&gt;i Hundason, a chieftain on the Inner Hebridean island of Tiree.28 Later, in early spring,{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson dated this to the spring of 1136.29|group=note}} the saga relates how Sveinn travelled to Atholl, where he stayed for a long period of time. From Atholl, Sveinn made his way back towards Orkney by land, and on the journey northwards, he passed through Thurso, in Caithness. The saga notes that Sveinn was accompanied by Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr, and that Sveinn had spent much of the previous spring with Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr.30 The chieftain who lived at Thurso was an earl named &lt;U+00D3&gt;ttarr, who is described as &quot;a man worthy of honour&quot;.31 Earl &lt;U+00D3&gt;ttarr was a brother of Frak&lt;U+00F6&gt;kk, and the saga relates how Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr negotiated a truce between Sveinn and Earl &lt;U+00D3&gt;ttarr, after Sveinn's father was killed by &lt;U+00D6&gt;lvir.32
The saga states that Sveinn made numerous Viking expeditions throughout the Hebrides, and into the Irish Sea zone. On one such occasion, Sveinn set up a base on the Isle of Man, where he married a wealthy widow. Some time later, Sveinn and his men were attacked by a force led by Holdbo&lt;U+00F0&gt;i, and in consequence Sveinn left the island and sailed north into the Hebrides to Lewis.33{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson dated the marriage to no earlier than 1140; he dated the attack to no earlier than 1141; and dated Sveinn leaving the island for Lewis, no earlier than the year 1142.34|group=note}}
Further on in the saga, it is stated that Sveinn's brother, Gunni &lt;U+00D3&gt;l&lt;U+00E1&gt;fsson, had children with Margr&lt;U+00E9&gt;t H&lt;U+00E1&gt;konard&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir, mother of Haraldr Madda&lt;U+00F0&gt;arson, Earl of Orkney, Mormaer of Caithness. Because of this relationship with his mother, Haraldr banished Gunni from the earldom, and enmity arose between Sveinn and the earl. Sveinn then sent Gunni to stay with Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr on Lewis, with whom Sveinn himself had stayed at an earlier time. The saga also states that at this time, Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr's son, Fugl, was with Haraldr, and consequently there was a &quot;coldness&quot; between Fugl and Sveinn.35 The saga relates that Sveinn stole a ship from Fugl, who had been travelling to Orkney to meet Haraldr.36 However, subsequently a relation of Fugl's, named Anakol, who became a friend of Sveinn, succeeded in making peace between the two.37{{#tag:ref|A.O. Anderson dated the events concerning Fugl to the year 1154.38|group=note}} Historian Garreth Williams noted that Anakol's name is Gaelic in origin, and like Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr and Fugl, he is described as being originally from the Hebrides. The saga also states that he was from a good family.39{{#tag:ref|According to Anderson's English edition of the saga (1873), later on Anakol's brother, Arnfinnr, and three other men, including a man named Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr, were all taken prisoner by followers of Haraldr following a brief skirmish.40 Vigfusson's Icelandic edition (1887) gives the man's name as Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr, but a corresponding footnote reads &quot;Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr] Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr, Fl.&quot;.41 P&lt;U+00E1&gt;lsson and Edwards' English edition (1981) gives this man's name as Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr.42|group=note}}
Links to Clan MacLeod
Captain F. W. L. Thomas, a 19th-century antiquarian, proposed that Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr was the eponymous progenitor of Clan MacLeod.4344 However, today the accepted understanding is that the clan's eponymous ancestor is another man, Leod, who flourished about a century after Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr.45 Leod's name, and the modern surname MacLeod, are considered to be ultimately derived from the Old Norse personal name Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr.46{{#tag:ref|Specifically, the modern forms Leod and MacLeod, are Anglicised forms of the Scottish Gaelic Le&lt;U+00F2&gt;d and MacLe&lt;U+00F2&gt;id, which are in turn derived from the older Old Norse Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr.|group=note}} This name is derived from the Old West Norse word lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr, meaning &quot;foul&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot;, &quot;misshapen&quot;. The personal name Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr is composed of two elements—the first, li&lt;U+00FA&gt;t, is derived from the Germanic word meaning &quot;light&quot;, &quot;shining&quot;; the second element, &lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr, is derived from a Germanic word meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.47{{#tag:ref|While it has been suggested that the Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;tr may be derived from the element li&lt;U+00FA&gt;t, like Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr, this is currently thought to be improbable.48|group=note}} While the current understanding of Leod's ancestry does not include a man named Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr,49 the 20th-century clan historian Alick Morrison considered it possible that Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr could be an ancestor of Leod, albeit on his distaff side; Morrison even suggested that Leod's name could have been derived from Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr.5051  The MacLeods have two main branches—S&lt;U+00EC&gt;ol Thormoid (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;seed of Tormod&quot;) and S&lt;U+00EC&gt;ol Thorcaill (&quot;seed of Torcall&quot;). S&lt;U+00EC&gt;ol Thorcaill was the dominant family on Lewis from the Late Middle Ages until the end of the 16th century.52 The Gaelic names Tormod and Torcall are derived from the Old Norse names &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r and &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rketill.53 Thomas noted that these names were also those of two men with Lewis connections, who are both recorded in the 13th-century kings' saga H&lt;U+00E1&gt;konar saga H&lt;U+00E1&gt;konarsonar. One of these men was &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rketill &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;sson, who according to the saga, was slain near the Isle of Skye in about the year 1230. Thomas proposed that this man could be a grandson of Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr.54 Another man who appears in the saga, &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rketilson, was forced to flee Lewis, leaving behind his wife, retainers, and goods; according to Thomas, this shows that &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r was a resident on the island. Thomas noted that &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rketilson was married in about 1231, and on the assumption that each generation could be estimated to be 30 years, Thomas gave &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r's birth at 1201; his (supposed) father, &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rketill, at 1171; &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rketill's father &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r at 1141; and this man's father at 1111. Thomas concluded that the elder &lt;U+00DE&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;rm&lt;U+00F3&gt;&lt;U+00F0&gt;r would have been born at about the time Lj&lt;U+00F3&gt;t&lt;U+00F3&gt;lfr flourished on Lewis.55
