Plot
The episode begins with general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) performing a special surgery, and to her dismay, the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) is absent from the operating room. At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged. In the next room, Meredith begins arguing with her husband, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), over whether or not he should report the chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.)'s alcoholism to Larry Jennings (Mitch Pileggi), the hospital's president. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) returns home after being on a hiatus, due to her being fired from the hospital, to rekindle her relationship with Karev. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez) and Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) are being intimate in the hospital's on-call room, until Torres discovers that she has the chicken pox. Robbins places her in isolation, because she wants a &quot;sexy&quot; relationship, and does not think the chicken pox can account to that.
Meredith is set to perform a Pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure with Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), under the supervision of Webber, but under the influence of alcohol, he falls asleep, and Bailey performs the surgery. In an effort to reason with Meredith, Shepherd offers her a proposition. Shepherd is aware that he will receive Webber's job if he is reported, and therefore will be in charge of hiring. He explains to Meredith that if she lets him report the chief, he will let Stevens re-obtain her job. Stevens enters the hospital to receive a PET scan, due to her cancer. When it is revealed that she is now cancer-free, her happiness leads Meredith to allowing Shepherd to report Webber. In the previous episode, &quot;Blink&quot;, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) told cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) that she could have Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), her boyfriend, if she continued to work at Seattle Grace Mercy West. An appalled Altman reveals this to Hunt, however, him and Yang subsequently mend their relationship, and Altman continues to work at the hospital. Lexie meets up with Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), her ex-boyfriend, and reveals that she had sex with Karev. Sloan reveals that he too was involved in sexual activity, but is unable to forgive Lexie. At the conclusion of the work-day, Stevens approaches Karev, seeking reconciliation, but he explains that he does not deserve to be treated the way he was, and asks her to leave. Meredith informs Stevens that she is getting her job back, but disinterested, Stevens departs, seeking a fresh start to life.

While writing the scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater explained that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: &quot;This is a real grown-up argument.

She's staying and fighting.&quot;9 While writing the episode, writers intended the theme of the episode to be &quot;exposure&quot;, but after the episode was filmed, realized it was &quot;ambition&quot;.10 Rater commented on this: &quot;Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn&lt;U+2019&gt;t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay.&quot;11 In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery.

And some of us came down on the Cristina side, and some of us came down on the Izzie side &lt;U+2013&gt; that in the end love is all that matters.&quot;12 At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens.
