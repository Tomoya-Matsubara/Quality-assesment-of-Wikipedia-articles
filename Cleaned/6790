Biography
 Johnson grew up in Mayfield and he has two siblings.12 He moved to Christchurch after his parents split up and attended Christ's College for two terms.3
Johnson is a student at Canterbury University, studying towards a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a Bachelor of Laws.45
Johnson successfully stood for the Riccarton-Wigram Community Board of the Christchurch City Council in the October 2010 local body elections.6 A member of the National Party, but not the Young Nats, he was endorsed by Prime Minister John Key for his election campaign. Key said of Johnson that he would become Prime Minister one day.7
In the days immediately following the earthquakes, while the university's Ilam campus was closed to enable the buildings to be checked for structural safety, 21-year-old Johnson and other students formed informal groups to help to assist with non-lifesaving tasks, in particularly cleaning up soil liquefaction residue on the streets and gardens of the city. Johnson and the other members of the Student Volunteer Army were highly visible and featured in much of the news reporting of the earthquake.
In 2011 Johnson won a Sir Peter Blake leadership award.89
