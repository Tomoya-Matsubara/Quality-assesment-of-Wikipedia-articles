 This list of tallest buildings in Dubai ranks skyscrapers in the city of Dubai by height. Dubai is the most populous city of the United Arab Emirates. It has 48 buildings that stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft), and 38 buildings stand taller than 200 metres (656 ft). Only Hong Kong and New York City are ahead of Dubai in highrises taller than 200 metres (656 ft) with 52 and 50 highrises respectively. However, Dubai has the most highrises over 300 metres (984 ft) of any city in the world, in comparison, Hong Kong has six. The tallest freestanding structure in Dubai is the 818 Meter (2,684 ft) Burj Dubai which topped out on January 17, 2009. Upon completion, the Burj Dubai will officially be the tallest building, freestanding structure, and man-made structure of any kind ever built on the planet. The second tallest building in Dubai is the 68-storey Almas Tower, which rises  in height.1 It is currently topped out, and is scheduled to be completed in late 2008. The tallest completed building in Dubai is the Emirates Office Tower, which rises 54 stories and 355 metres (1,163 ft) along Sheikh Zayed Road.2 It is currently the 19th-tallest building in the world. Another notable Dubai skyscraper is the Rose Tower, which stands as the fourth-tallest building in the city and the tallest all-hotel building in the world.The skyscrapers of Dubai are, for the most part, clustered in two different locations. The land along Sheikh Zayed Road was the first to develop, followed by the Dubai Marina neighborhood.
The history of skyscrapers in Dubai began with the construction of the  Dubai World Trade Centre in 1979, which is regarded to be the first skyscraper in the city. At the time of its completion, it also stood as the tallest building in the Middle East. Since 1999, and especially from 2005 onwards, Dubai has been on an extremely large skyscraper building boom, with all 28 of its buildings over  tall completed after 1999. Dubai currently has 390 completed highrises,3 but that number will increase greatly in the near future. With 321 highrises currently under construction, and 551 planned highrises, Dubai's skyline is rapidly growing.4 In addition, Dubai is expected to be the site of more buildings with 100 floors or more than any other city in the world by 2015. As well as it will have the most number of Highrises taller than 200 metres (656 ft), surpassing New York City and Hong Kong.5
The largest and arguably the most famous construction project currently taking place in Dubai is the Burj Dubai, which began construction in 2004. The Burj Dubai is now topped out and it is the tallest building, freestanding structure, and man-made structure of any kind ever built on the planet. The Burj Dubai topped out on January 17, 2009 at 818 Meters (2,684 ft) and it became the tallest free-standing structure in the world on September 12, 2007, surpassing the 553-metre (1,815 ft) CN Tower in Toronto, Canada.6 The building also surpassed the height of Taipei 101, the current tallest building in the world, on July 21, 2007. However, as only completed structures are measured as buildings, Burj Dubai will not officially gain the title of tallest building in the world until its completion in 2009. In April 2008, Burj Dubai became the tallest man-made structure in the world, surpassing the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, United States. On May 19, 2008 it surpassed the height of the now-destroyed Warsaw radio mast in Konstantyn&lt;U+00F3&gt;w, G&lt;U+0105&gt;bin, Poland, becoming the tallest man-made structure in history at 649.7 metres (2,131 ft). The proposed Nakheel Tower is another extremely tall development planned for construction in Dubai. Set to rise at least 1,400 metres (4,593 ft) in height, with 200 Floors, this building would surpass the Burj Dubai to become the tallest structure in the world if constructed.7
