Dream, After Dream, performed by American rock group Journey, is the soundtrack to the Japanese film of the same title. It was released in 1980 on the Columbia Records label.
The soundtrack consists mostly of instrumental tracks with sparse vocals on two tracks, &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Sand Castles&quot;. The closing song, &quot;Little Girl&quot; is the only true vocal track. Little Girl was initially the B-Side of the Open Arms single and was later featured on Journey's Time3 collection. The track also appears as a bonus track on the 2006 reissue of Departure.
