Octavio M. Salati (1914-2001) was Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in the field of Electromagnetic Compatibility.
Family
Octavio (Tav) Salati was born to Armando Salati and Julia LaFazia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tav married Marie Pattani (1919-2010) and they had three children.
Career
Tav Salati received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1936. Following graduation, he was employed by Philco Radio and Television Company, Radio Corporation of America, C.G. Conn Ltd., and Hazeltine Corporation. Tav returned to the Moore School of Electrical Engineering as a research associate in 1948, received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1963, and became professor of electrical engineering in 1975. Dr. Salati was made a Fellow of the IEEE in 1975, and he retired from Penn in 1984.1
Role in BNC connector development
While working at Hazeltine Corporation, Dr. Salati was awarded United States patent #2,540,012 which was the basis for what is now commonly known as the BNC connector.2 The patent for Electrical Connector was filed May 19, 1945, and issued January 30, 1951.3 BNC is an acronym for Bayonet Neill-Concelman. The BNC connector is still in common use for coaxial cables that carry high frequency currents between pieces of electronics and communications equipment.4 Canadian patent #487446 was also awarded to Dr. Salati for this invention on October 21, 1952.5

Reviewers, please see BNC connector. As Paul Neill and Carl Concelman have Wikipedia stubs, it would seem appropriate for the patent holder to be recognized in a similar manner. Thank you ! Eyeze (talk) 02:36, 24 June 2013 (UTC)
