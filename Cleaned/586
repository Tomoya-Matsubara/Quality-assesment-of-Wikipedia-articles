The Grumman JF &quot;Duck&quot; was a single-engine amphibious biplane. It first flew in May 1933 and was produced from 1933 until 1935 when it was replaced by the J2F.
The Duck's main pontoon was part of the fuselage, making it a flying boat, though it appears more like a standard aircraft with an added float.
It set an amphibian speed record in December 1934, at 191 mph (307 km/h).
