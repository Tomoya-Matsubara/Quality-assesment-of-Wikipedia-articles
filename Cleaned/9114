The definition of Macedonia is a major source of confusion and debate because of the overlapping use of the term to describe geographical, political and historical areas, languages and peoples. Ethnic groups inhabiting the area use different terminology for the same entity, or the same terminology for different entities, which is often confusing to other inhabitants of the region and foreigners alike.
Macedonia lies in the middle of the Balkans, and Balkan history is complex. Historically, the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula. Geographically, no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups. Demographically, it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups, three of which self-identify as Macedonians: one Slavic group does so at a national level, while a Bulgarian and a Greek one do so at a regional level. Linguistically, the names and origins of the languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy. Politically, the use of the name Macedonia has led to a diplomatic dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. Despite intervention from the United Nations, the dispute is still pending full resolution.
Etymology
There are a number of theories regarding the etymology of the name Macedonia.
Mythological personage
According to ancient Greek mythology, Makednos was the name of the first phylarch (tribal chief) or progenitor of the tribe that initially settled western, southern and central Macedonia and founded the kingdom of Macedon.
Tall men
According to Herodotus, the Makedno&lt;U+00ED&gt; were a tribe akin to the Dorians,1 one of the principal ancient Greek tribes. The name probably derives from the adjective  makedn&lt;U+00F3&gt;s, meaning &quot;tall&quot;, which Homer uses for a poplar tree,2 and which the grammarian Hesychius of Alexandria records as a Doric word meaning &quot;large&quot; or &quot;heavenly&quot;.3 It has been commonly suggested that both the Macedonians (Maked&lt;U+00F3&gt;nes) and their Makedno&lt;U+00ED&gt; tribal ancestors were regarded as tall people.4
Highland and highlanders
According to the World Book Encyclopedia, the names Macedonia and Macedonians derive from the Greek word Macednon which means high — a reference to the group's mountainous homeland. The Online Etymology Dictionary summarizes these theories as: 
There would appear to be a synonymy among the names of different tribes living in the region: the most likely meanings of Dorians and Bryges also are &quot;highlanders.&quot; All the previous names are of Indo-European origin, the root of makednos being *m&lt;U+0101&gt;k-, &quot;long, thin&quot;, which becomes &quot;long, large&quot; in Greek.5 The syllables beyond *m&lt;U+0101&gt;k- are not a compound resulting from the process of production, but are an inherited extension of unknown prehistoric origin; in this case, *-dno-.6
Another hypothesis suggests that Maked&lt;U+00F3&gt;nes may derive from an unattested ancient Macedonian bahuvrihi * *maki-ked&lt;U+00F3&gt;nes meaning &quot;of the high earth&quot; or &quot;highlanders&quot;,7 which means the same thing but achieves the meaning with a compound rather than an extension.
In history
The region of Macedonia has been home to several historical political entities; the main ones are given below. The borders of each of these entities were different. The area occupied by ancient Macedon approximately coincided with contemporary Macedonia in Greece.8
In early history
Main articles: History of the region of Macedonia and Macedon
The ancient kingdom of Macedon had more or less definite borders, although the question of whether the upland areas, like Lyncestis, were part of the kingdom or independent states tended to be fought out under most of the Macedonian kings. Under Philip II of Macedon, Macedonia expanded markedly, growing to include Chalcidice, and northward to the Danube; Philip personally controlled much of Greece. Under Alexander the Great, Macedon expanded within decades to an Empire, occupying most of the known world; one part of it then became the Hellenistic kingdom of Macedonia. After the Roman conquest following the Macedonian Wars, the Roman Senate established a province of Macedonia, which had various borders in different centuries. The Roman provincial system stopped working at the fall of the Roman Empire, and when the Byzantines set up a theme of Macedonia, it was much further to the East, excluding even Chalcidice, to say nothing of Thessalonica. The Ottoman Empire did not use Macedonia as the name of an administrative unit.
Historical political entities which have used the name Macedonia were:
Macedon, the ancient kingdom, existed in the northernmost part of ancient Greece, bordering the kingdom of Epirus on the west and the region of Thrace to the east. The first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BCE. Its notable ruler Alexander the Great conquered all of the known world to the east of Greece until his early death in 323 BCE. The kingdom lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168 BCE.9
The Romans had two different entities called Macedonia, at different levels:
Macedonia was established as a Roman province in 146 BC Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience, but it usually extended west to the Adriatic. Diocletian divided it into Macedonia prima and Macedonia salutaris.
Macedonia, was a late Roman diocese, organized some time around 300; authorities differ, but it certainly existed under Constantine. In addition to the two Macedonian provinces, it included Epirus vetus, Epirus nova, Thessaly, Achaea, and Crete - almost all of modern Greece and the present Republic, as well as much of Albania. Both the diocese and the provinces ceased to function as administrative units when the late Roman Empire lost control of the Balkans around 600 or 700.
Macedonia, during the Byzantine period, was a new theme organised by Empress Irene, out of the Theme of Strymon, stretching of Adrianople and the Evros valley east along the Sea of Marmara (ancient Macedon was the Theme of Thessalonica). John I Tzimisces replaced this with a ducate of Adrianople, which included much of his Bulgarian conquests.10
The Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder, Basil I the Macedonian; he was born in this theme of Macedonia. His ancestry is disputed; contemporary accounts call him an Armenian by descent.
The Ottomans held Macedonia for five centuries; they did not keep Macedonia as an administrative unit. The region of European Turkey lying between Thessaly and Serbia continued to be called Macedonia, however. In 1904, when most of it was placed under international administration, it contained the districts of Salonica, Monastir, &lt;U+00DC&gt;sk&lt;U+00FC&gt;b, Kossovo, Drama, and Serres. In 1912&lt;U+2013&gt;3, this was divided among the Balkan states.11121314
The ancient Christian sect, the Macedonians, derived their name from their founder, Bishop Macedonius I of Constantinople, not from any political or geographical region of Macedonia.
In modern history
Since the early stages of the Greek Revolution, the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory, but the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary between Arta and Volos.15 When the Ottoman Empire started breaking apart, Macedonia was claimed by all members of the Balkan League (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria), and by Romania. Under the Treaty of San Stefano that ended the Russo-Turkish War, 1877&lt;U+2013&gt;78 the entire region, except Thessaloniki, was included in the borders of Bulgaria, but after the Congress of Berlin in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire. The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied Macedonia in the First Balkan War in 1912. Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region, the Second Balkan War erupted, and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into definite borders. The political entities that existed or still exist in this region, under the name Macedonia are:
Macedonia (as a region of Greece) refers to a region of three peripheries in northern Greece, incorporated in 1913, as a result of the Balkan Wars, between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League.16
Macedonia (as a People's Republic within Yugoslavia) used to refer to the People's Republic of Macedonia established in 1946, later known as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of the constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, renamed in 1963.17
Macedonia (as a contemporary sovereign state) refersN- to the conventional short form name of the Republic of Macedonia, which held a referendum and established its independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991.18
In geography
Macedonia (as a current geographical term) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in south-eastern Europe, covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Ali&lt;U+00E1&gt;kmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strym&lt;U+00F3&gt;nas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.
 In a historic context, the region presents markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula, since borders were loosely defined according to the administrative requirements of its conquerors. Under the Ottoman conquest, which lasted five centuries, Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire.19 H.R. Wilkinson, the geographer, suggests that the region &quot;defies definition&quot;, but that many mappers agree &quot;on its general location&quot;.20 Macedonia was well enough defined in 1897 for Gladstone to propose &quot;Macedonia for the Macedonians&quot;, implying all the inhabitants of the region, irrespective of their ethnicity.21 The Balkan nations began to proclaim their rights to it after the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 and its revision at the Congress of Berlin.
Many ethnographic maps were produced in this period of controversy; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia. This was in part a result of the choice of definition: an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was denomination, descent, language, self-identification or personal choice. In addition, the Ottoman census, taken on the basis of religion, was misquoted by all sides; descent, or &quot;race&quot;, was largely conjectural; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home, and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian &quot;with Bulgarian influences&quot;, Macedonian, or West-Bulgarian.
These maps would also differ somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the Aegean Sea and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered on Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman Rumelia) was debatable.22
The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides, the Austrian Meinhard, and the Bulgarian K&lt;U+01CE&gt;n&lt;U+010D&gt;ev accepted the &lt;U+0160&gt;ar Mountains and the Crna hills; as had scholars before 1878.23 The Serb Gop&lt;U+010D&gt;evi&lt;U+010D&gt; preferred a line much further south, assigning the entire region from Skopje to Strumica to &quot;Old Serbia&quot;; and some later Greek geographers have agreed to a more restricted Macedonia.24 In addition, maps might vary in smaller details: as to whether this town or that was Macedonian. One Italian map included Prizren, where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it. On the south and west, Grevena, Kor&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00EB&gt;, and Konitsa varied from map to map; on the east, the usual line is the lower Mesta / Nestos river and then north or northwest, but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude Bansko and Nevrokop / Gotse Delchev.25
Subregions
The region of Macedonia is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub-regions.26 The name Macedonia appears under certain contexts on the major regions, while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local toponyms:
Major
The region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub-regions, especially when discussing the Macedonian Question. The terms are used in non-partisan scholarly works, although they are also used in ethnic Macedonian literature of an irredentist nature:27
Aegean MacedoniaN- (or Greek Macedonia) is a term that refers to an area in the south of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are, overall, those of ancient Macedonia in Greece. It covers an area of 34,200 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;28 (for discussion of the reported irredentist origin of this term, see Aegean Macedonia).
Pirin MacedoniaN- (or Bulgarian Macedonia) is an area in the east of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area approximately coincide with those of Blagoevgrad Province in Bulgaria.29 It covers an area of 6,449 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;.30
Vardar Macedonia (formerly Yugoslav Macedonia) is an area in the north of the Macedonia region. The borders of the area are those of the Republic of Macedonia.31 It covers an area of 25,333 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;.32
Minor
In addition to the above named sub-regions, there are also two smaller regions, in Albania and Serbia respectively. These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia. They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows,33 but typically aren't referred to by non-partisan scholars.
Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in Albania, mainly around the Lake Ohrid. It includes parts of the Kor&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00EB&gt;, Pogradec and Devoll districts. These districts in whole occupy about 3,000 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;, but the area concerned is significantly smaller.
Gora and Prohor Pchinski are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia. They roughly correspond to the Serbian municipality of Draga&lt;U+0161&gt; (435 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;) and the monastery of Prohor P&lt;U+010D&gt;injski.
In demographics
The region, as defined above, has a total population of about 5 million. The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self-identifying name of two contemporary groups. The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self-identify as Macedonian on a national level, while the Greek Macedonians self-identify as both Macedonian on a regional, and Greek on a national level. This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups, more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section.

The self-identifying Macedonians (collectively referring to the inhabitants of the region) that inhabit or inhabited the area are:
As an ethnic group, Macedonians refersN- to the majority of the population of the Republic of Macedonia. Statistics for 2002 indicate the population of ethnic Macedonians within Republic of Macedonia as 1,297,981.3435 On the other hand, as a legal term, it refers to all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia, irrespective of their ethnic or religious affiliation.36 However, the preamble of the constitution37 distinguishes between &quot;the Macedonian people&quot; and the &quot;Albanians, Turks, Vlachs, Romanics and other nationalities living in the Republic of Macedonia&quot;, but for whom &quot;full equality as citizens&quot; is provided. As of 2002 the total population of the country is 2,022,547.38
As a regional group in Greece, Macedonians refers to ethnic Greeks living in regions referred to as Macedonia, and particularly Greek Macedonia. This group composes the vast majority of the population of the Greek region of Macedonia. The 2001 census for the total population of the Macedonia region in Greece shows 2,625,681.39
The same term in antiquity described the inhabitants of the kingdom of Macedon,40 including their notable rulers Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great who self-identified as Greeks.41
As a regional group in Bulgaria, Macedonians refers to the inhabitants of Bulgarian Macedonia, who in their vast majority self-identify as Bulgarians at a national level and as Macedonians at a regional, but not ethnic level.42 As of 2001, the total population of Bulgarian Macedonia is 341,245, while the ethnic Macedonians living in the same region are 3,117.43 The Bulgarian Macedonians also self-identify as Piriners (&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0446&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;, pirintsi)44 to avoid confusion with the neighboring ethnic group.
Macedo-Romanians can be used as an alternative name for Aromanians, people living throughout the southern Balkans, especially in northern Greece, Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and as an emigrant community in Northern Dobruja, Romania. According to Ethnologue, their total population in all countries is 306,237.45 This not very frequent appellation is the only one with the disambiguating portmanteau, both within the members of the same ethnic group and the other ethnic groups in the area.46 To make matters more confusing, Aromanians are often called &quot;Machedoni&quot; by Romanians, as opposed to the citizens of Macedonia, who are called &quot;Macedoneni&quot;.
The ethnic Albanians living in the region of Macedonia, as defined above, are mainly concentrated in the Republic of Macedonia (especially in the northwestern part that borders Kosovo and Albania), and less in the Albanian minor sub-region of Macedonia around the Lake Ohrid. As of 2002, the total population of Albanians within the republic is 509,083 or 25.2% of the country's total population.47
In linguistics
As language is one of the elements tied in with national identity, the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics. There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon, be it a language or a dialect:
Linguistic Macedonia
MacedonianN-
Macedonian       
Macedonian
Macedo-Romanian
The origins of the Ancient Macedonian language are currently debated. At this time it is not determined whether the language / dialect was a Greek dialect related to Doric Greek4849 and/or Aeolic Greek50 dialects among others, a sibling language of ancient Greek forming a Greaco-Macedonian or Hellenic supergroup, or an independent Indo-European language close to Greek, Thracian and Phrygian languages.51 The scientific community generally agrees that, although some sources are available (e.g. Hesychius' lexicon, Pella curse tablet)52 there is no decisive evidence for supporting either hypothesis.53
The (south Slavic) Macedonian languageN- is unrelated to the Ancient Macedonian language. It is currently the subject of two major disputes. The first is over the name (alternative ways of referring to this language can be found in the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute). The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups,54 and also by many ordinary Bulgarians. Further information on this can be found in the Macedonian language article.
Macedonian is also the name of a dialect of Modern Greek, a language of the Indo-European family. Additionally, Macedo-Romanian is an Eastern Romance language, spoken in Southeastern Europe by the Aromanians.55
In politics
The controversies in geographic, linguistic and demographic terms, are also manifested in international politics. Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the break up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, was the (until then) subnational entity of SFRJ, by the official name of Socialist Republic of Macedonia, the others being Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. The peaceful break-away of that nation resulted in a necessary change for its name, to signify disassociation from federal Yugoslavia.  Republic of MacedoniaN- is the constitutional name56 of the sovereign state which occupies the northern part of the geographical region of Macedonia, which roughly coincides with the geographic subregion of Vardar Macedonia. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) is a term used to refer to this state by the main international organisations, including United Nations,57 European Union,58 NATO,59 IMF,60 WTO,61 IOC,62 World Bank,63 EBRD,64 OSCE,65 FIFA,66 and FIBA.67 The term was introduced in 1993 by the United Nations, following a naming dispute with Greece. Some countries use this term as a stop-gap measure, pending resolution of the naming dispute.68
Greece and the Republic of Macedonia each consider this name a compromise:69 it is opposed by some Greeks for containing the Greek self-identifying name Macedonia, and by many in the Republic of Macedonia for not being the short self-identifying name.70 Greece uses it in both the abbreviated (FYROM or &lt;U+03A0&gt;&lt;U+0393&gt;&lt;U+0394&gt;&lt;U+039C&gt;)N- and spellout form (&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03CE&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; &lt;U+0393&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03B3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B2&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03AE&gt; &lt;U+0394&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+039C&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;).
Macedonia refers also to a geographic region in Greece, which roughly coincides with the southernmost major geographic subregion of Macedonia. It is divided in the three administrative sub-regions (peripheries) of West, Central, and East Macedonia. The region is overseen by the Ministry for Macedonia&lt;U+2013&gt;Thrace. The capital of Greek Macedonia is Thessaloniki, which is the largest city in the region of Macedonia. Thessaloniki is also the joint capital city (&quot;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03C9&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03CD&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&quot;-symprot&lt;U+00E9&gt;vousa)71 of Greece, the capital being Athens.
Ethnic Macedonian nationalism (Extreme and moderate)
Extremist ethnic Macedonian nationalists of the &quot;United Macedonia&quot; movement have expressed irredentist claims to what they refer to as &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot; (in Greece),727374 &quot;Pirin Macedonia&quot; (in Bulgaria),75 &quot;Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo&quot; (in Albania),76 and &quot;Gora and Prohor Pchinski&quot; (in Serbia).77 Greek Macedonians, Bulgarians, Albanians and Serbs form the overwhelming majority of the population of each part of the region respectively.
Loring M. Danforth, a professor of anthropology working at Bates College in the United States who has written many award winning books and articles on Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Australia and nationalism, reports:
Schoolbooks and official government publications in the Republic have shown the country as part of an &quot;unliberated&quot; whole,7879808182838485 although the constitution of the Republic, especially after its amendment in 1995, does not include any territorial claims.8687
Greek nationalism
Professor Danforth describes the Greek nationalist position on Macedonia as follows:

Terminology by group
All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways. Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they may be perceived as such by the receiving ethnic group. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.
A proportion of Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians have extremist views about their inter-relatedness. On the one hand, extremist ethnic Macedonians88 seek to deny the possibility of any national, linguistic and historical relatedness to the Bulgarians. On the other hand, extremist Bulgarians seek to downplay this distinctiveness,89 and are often supported by extremist Greeks.90 Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self-identification of the Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece,91 which mostly self-identifies as Greek. Extremists on all sides have been known to fabricate and reproduce falsified information, along with denying genuine information and propagating unscientific and pseudoscientific theories.929394
Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below. Any denial of self-identification by any side, or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side, can be seen as highly offensive. General usage of these terms follows:
 Bulgarian
G&lt;U+0103&gt;rkomani (&lt;U+0413&gt;&lt;U+044A&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;) is a derogatory term used to refer to the largest portion of the Slavic-speaking minority of Macedonia in Greece who self-identify as Greeks.95
Macedonian (&lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0446&gt;) - a person originating from the region of Macedonia - the term has only regional, not ethnical meaning, and it usually means a Bulgarian, or a clarification is made (Greek, Albanian...).
Macedonian (&lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;) and the Slavic dialects of Greece are considered dialects of Bulgarian by Bulgarian linguists, not independent languages or dialects of other languages (e.g. Serbian). This is also the popular view in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government, therefore, has officially recognized the language merely as &quot;the constitutional language of the Republic of Macedonia&quot;.9697 Translations are officially called &quot;adaptations&quot;.
Macedonism (&lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0437&gt;&lt;U+044A&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;) is a term referring to the political ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It is also used to describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.98 (see Macedonism).
Macedonistics (&lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;) is a term, generally synonymous with disciplines such as study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia. It is generally considered in Bulgaria to be a kind of pseudoscience.
Macedonist (&lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;) is a term for a person (typically Macedonian Slav) who believes that Macedonian Slavs are not ethnic Bulgarians but a separate ethnic group, directly descended from the ancient Macedonians. It is a more negatively charged synonym of &quot;Macedonian nationalist&quot;. More rarely it is used for someone associated with the study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people (not necessarily from the Republic of Macedonia or Yugoslavia), whose studies support the official historical doctrine of the Republic of Macedonia or former Yugoslavia.99
Old Bulgarian (&lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+044A&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0433&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;) is the name Bulgarians give to the Old Church Slavonic language used in the Ohrid Literary School among others. In contrast, Old Church Slavonic is rarely referred to by Macedonians as Old Macedonian, but is referred to as Old Slavic.100

Notes
n-[1]  During the Greek Civil War, in 1947, the Greek Ministry of Press and Information published a book, I Enandion tis Ellados Epivoulis (&quot;Designs on Greece&quot;), namely of documents and speeches on the ongoing Macedonian issue, many translations from Yugolsav officials. It reports Josip Broz Tito using the term &quot;Aegean Macedonia&quot; on the October 11, 1945 in the build up to the Greek Civil War; the original document is archived in &lt;U+2018&gt;GFM A/24581/G2/1945&lt;U+2019&gt;. For Athens, the &lt;U+201C&gt;new term, Aegean Macedonia&lt;U+201D&gt;, (also &lt;U+201C&gt;Pirin Macedonia&lt;U+201D&gt;), was introduced by Yugoslavs. Contextually, this observation indicates this was part of the Yugoslav offensive against Greece, laying claim to Greek Macedonia, but Athens does not take issue with the term itself. The 1945 date concurs with Bulgarian sources. Further information on this can be found in the article Aegean Macedonia.
n-[2]  Despite a history of use by Bulgarian nationalists,125 the term &quot;Pirin Macedonia&quot; is today regarded as offensive by certain Bulgarians,126 who assert that it is widely used by Macedonists as part of the irredentist concept of United Macedonia. However, many people in the country also think of the name as a purely geographical term, which it has historically been. Its use is, thus, controversial.
n-[3]  The constitutional name of the country &quot;Republic of Macedonia&quot; and the short name &quot;Macedonia&quot; when referring to the country, can be considered offensive by most Greeks, especially inhabitants of the Greek province of Macedonia. The official reasons for this, as described by the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, are:
n-[4] The abbreviated term &quot;FYROM&quot; can be considered offensive when used to refer to the Republic of Macedonia. The spellout of the term, the &quot;former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot;, is not necessarily considered offensive, but some ethnic Macedonians may still find it offensive due to their right of self-identification being ignored. The term can also be offensive for Greeks under certain contexts, since it contains the word Macedonia.
n-[5]  Although acceptable in the past, current use of the name &quot;Slavomacedonian&quot; in reference to both the ethnic group and the language can be considered pejorative and offensive by ethnic Macedonians living in Greece. The Greek Helsinki Monitor reports:
