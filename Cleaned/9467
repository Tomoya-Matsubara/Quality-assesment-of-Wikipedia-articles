Glastonbury Lake Village was an iron age village on the Somerset Levels near Godney, some  north west of Glastonbury. It covers an area of  north to south by  east to west.1
The village was built in about 300BC and occupied into the early Roman period (around 100AD) when ity was abandoned, possibly due to a rise in the water level.2 It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracen, rubble and clay.3
The village housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for an extended family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade.
The village was close to the old course of the River Brue.
Excavation
The lake village, a 'crannog' or man made island, was discovered in 1892 by Arthur Bulleid a local medical student, and son of a local mayor and the founder of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society.4 The excavation of the area was started in 1897. It found timber remains of the village.5 Much of the timber was reburied as the best way of preserving it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful,6 despite reports warning of the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced.7
Artifacts
The artifacts recovered include fragments of pottery, charcoal, bone and a whetstone (a stone for sharpening blades). Later, on excavation, spinning whorls and weaving combs were found, suggesting textile production. Evidence of bronze-casting and iron-smelting were found.8 Fine jewellery made from bronze bone have also been found showing a high degree of craftsmanship.9
Files and hammer heads were examined by metallography which showed that carbon compositions were found to be generally low.10
Bronze Bowl
A key find was a sheet bronze bowl which was examined in 2007 and suggested that the bowl has been made from the remnants of two seperate vessels, before it was deposited in the peat. Further investigation by electron microprobe analysis and optical microscopy has been proposed.11
Wooden objects
The site yielded a number of wooden object preserved in the peaty soil including five wheel spokes and an unfinished nave.12
Woven baskets recovered from the site provided evidence of woven baskets up to 700mm in width and 480mm in height.13
Exhibition
The site and the finds from it are the property of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society.
Many of the finds from the site are on display in the Glastonbury Lake Village Museum at The Tribune in Glastonbury High Street, and in the Somerset County Museum in Taunton.
Representations of the houses have been recreated at the nearby Peat Moors Centre.
