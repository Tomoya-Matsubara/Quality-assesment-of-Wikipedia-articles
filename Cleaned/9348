1 The system of using goal average to separate two teams tied on points was used up to and including the 1976&lt;U+2013&gt;77 season.
2 The points system: 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for losing.
3 The tables as published at the time contained errors, hence the totals do not balance in some columns.3
