Mossad (, ), meaning &quot;institute&quot; or &quot;institution&quot; in Hebrew, known in full as the Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations ( HaMossad leModi'in uleTafkidim Meyuchadim,  al-M&lt;U+016B&gt;ss&lt;U+0101&gt;d li'l-Istikhb&lt;U+0101&gt;r&lt;U+0101&gt;t wa'l-Mah&lt;U+0101&gt;mm al-Kh&lt;U+0101&gt;&lt;U+1E63&gt;&lt;U+1E63&gt;a) is the national intelligence agency of Israel.
The Mossad is responsible for intelligence collection and covert operations including assassinations and paramilitary activities beyond Israel's borders, and bringing Jews to Israel from countries where official Aliyah agencies are forbidden. It is one of the main entities in the Israeli Intelligence Community, along with Aman (military intelligence) and Shin Bet (internal security), but its director reports directly to the Prime Minister.
Organization
Executive offices
The largest department of the Mossad is Collections, tasked with many aspects of conducting espionage overseas. Employees in the Collections Department operate under a variety of covers, including diplomatic and unofficial.1 Their field intelligence officers, called katsas (Hebrew: acronym, meaning &quot;Collections Officer&quot;), are similar to case officers of the CIA. Thirty to forty operate at a time, mainly in Europe and the Middle East.2The Political Action and Liaison Department is responsible for working both with allied foreign intelligence services, and with nations that have no normal diplomatic relations with Israel.3Additionally, the Mossad has a Research Department, tasked with intelligence production, and a Technology Department concerned with the development of tools for Mossad activities.4
History
The Mossad was formed on December 13, 1949 as the &quot;Central Institute for Coordination&quot; at the recommendation of Reuven Shiloah to Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Shiloah wanted a central body to coordinate and improve cooperation between the existing security services &lt;U+2013&gt; the army's intelligence department (AMAN), the General Security Service (GSS or &quot;Shin Bet&quot;) and the foreign office's &quot;political department&quot;. In March 1951, it was reorganized and made a part of the prime minister's office, reporting directly to the prime minister.
Mossad's former motto: be-tachb&lt;U+016B&gt;l&lt;U+014D&gt;t ta`aseh lekh&lt;U+0101&gt; milch&lt;U+0101&gt;m&lt;U+0101&gt;h (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; &lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05DA&gt; &lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;) is a quote from the Bible (Proverbs 24:6): &quot;For by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory&quot; (NRSV). The motto was changed recently to another Proverbs passage: be-'&lt;U+00E9&gt;yn tachb&lt;U+016B&gt;l&lt;U+014D&gt;t yippol `&lt;U+0101&gt;m; &lt;U+016B&gt;-tesh&lt;U+016B&gt;`&lt;U+0101&gt;h be-rov y&lt;U+014D&gt;'&lt;U+00E9&gt;ts (Hebrew: &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt; &lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt;, &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05E5&gt;) (Proverbs 11:14). This is translated by NRSV as: &quot;Where there is no guidance, a nation falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.&quot;

Relations with other agencies
Over the last 60 years, the Mossad has experienced a mixed relationship with Western intelligence agencies. A secret addendum was promised to Anwar Sadat by the CIA if he agreed to the terms of the Camp David Accords. The CIA would supply Sadat with all of Israel's military secrets, as part of a covert intelligence liaison between Washington and Cairo. According to a former US army officer:
We gave Sadat everything. Satellite photos, intercepts, the location of Israel's nuclear force, everything he wanted. As it turned out, the Israelis discovered that we had bribed Sadat, but Begin told everyone to keep their mouths shut. America was the only ally Israel had left. Still, betraying all of Israel's secrets was a pretty shitty thing for us to do.6
Starting in 1979, the CIA started sharing intelligence provided by the Mossad with Saudi Arabia. The CIA was &quot;pouring intelligence about Israel into the Saudi's military headquarters.&quot; The Saudis lacked the skills to interpret and analyze most of the Israeli intelligence, so the CIA would provide the expertise, and in exchange the Saudis would share US supplied-information about Israel's weak points with other Arab nations.7
In the aftermath of the Six Day War, the French government and military terminated all weapons support for Israel in a &quot;fawning attempt to please Arab oil kingdoms.&quot; Despite the ban, the Mossad was able to convince French intelligence to force their contractors to finish construction on Israel's nuclear weapons project. Prior to the ban, the Mossad uncovered Charles De Gaulle's scandalous role in recruiting Fascist fugitives as French agents to fight the Communists in the Balkans. The Mossad revealed that several prominent members of de Gaulle's administration had been Nazi collaborators, among them Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois-Poncet.8
The Israelis threatened to expose de Gaulle if he were to implement the weapons ban. No matter how furious French leaders became at Israel, their military intelligence continued to supervise the construction of the plutonium factory at Dimona.9
During the Eisenhower administration, CIA director Allen Welsh Dulles was responsible for recruiting Nazi war criminals as intelligence agents and sponsored their immigration to the United States. United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles actively betrayed British, French and Israeli military secrets to the Arab nations in order to gain the dominant role in the Middle East. In response to Eisenhower's policies, the Mossad temporarily abandoned intelligence sharing with the United States and switched allegiances to MI6 and French intelligence.10
Alleged operations
United States
During the 1990s, the Mossad discovered a Hezbollah agent operating within the United States in order to procure materials needed to manufacture IEDs and other weapons. In a joint operation with U.S. intelligence, the agent was kept under surveillance in hopes that he would betray more Hezbollah operatives, but was eventually arrested.11
Shortly before the September 11 attacks, the Mossad warned the FBI and CIA that it had detected as many as 200 terrorists slipping into the United States and planning a major attack against a large-scale target.12
Argentina
In 1960, the Mossad discovered that Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann was in Argentina. A team of five Mossad agents slipped into Argentina and through surveillance, they confirmed that he had been living there under the name of Ricardo Klement. He was abducted on May 11, 1960 and taken to a hideout, where the agents put an SS cap on him and compared him to a photograph of Eichmann in SS uniform, confirming that it was Eichmann. He was subsequently smuggled to Israel aboard an El Al flight where he was tried and executed. Argentina protested what it considered as the violation of its sovereignty, and the United Nations Security Council noted that &quot;repetition of acts such as [this] would involve a breach of the principles upon which international order is founded, creating an atmosphere of insecurity and distrust incompatible with the preservation of peace&quot; while also acknowledging that &quot;Eichmann should be brought to appropriate justice for the crimes of which he is accused&quot; and that &quot;this resolution should in no way be interpreted as condoning the odious crimes of which Eichmann is accused.&quot;1314 Mossad abandoned a second operation, intended to capture Josef Mengele.
Uruguay

Europe
Austria
The Mossad gathered information on Austrian politician Jorg Haider using a Mole.15
Belgium
The Mossad is alleged to be responsible for the assassination of Canadian engineer and ballistics expert Gerald Bull March 22, 1990. He was shot multiple times in the head outside his Brussels apartment.16 Bull was at the time working for Iraq on the Project Babylon supergun.17 The most common theory is that the Mossad was responsible, and its representatives have all but claimed responsibility for his assassination. Others, including Bull's son, believe that the Mossad is taking credit for an act they did not commit to scare off others who may try to help enemy regimes. The alternative theory is that Bull was killed by the CIA. Iraq and Iran are also candidates for suspicion.18

On April 5, 1979, Mossad agents triggered an explosion which destroyed 60 percent of components being built in Toulouse for an Iraqi reactor. An environmental organization, Groupe des &lt;U+00E9&gt;cologistes fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ais, unheard of before this incident, claimed credit for the blast.26 The reactor was subsequently destroyed by an Israeli air strike in 1981.2728
Germany
Operation Plumbat (1968) was an operation by Lekem-Mossad to further Israel's nuclear program. The German freighter &quot;Scheersberg A&quot;, disappeared on its way from Antwerp to Genoa along with its cargo of 200 tons of yellowcake, after supposedly being transferred to an Israeli ship.29
The sending of letter bombs during the Operation Wrath of God campaign. Some of these attacks were not fatal. Their purpose might not have been to kill the receiver. Some of the more famous examples of the Mossad letter bombs were those sent to Nazi war-criminal Alois Brunner.30
The alleged assassination of Dr Wadie Haddad, using poisoned chocolate, in 1978. The PFLP-EO movement dissolved after his assassination.31
The Mossad discovered that Hezbollah had recruited a German national named Steven Smyrek, and that he was travelling to Israel. In an operation conducted by the Mossad, the CIA, the German Internal Security agency Bundesamt f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Verfassungsschutz, and the Israeli Internal Security agency Shin Bet, Smyrek was kept under constant surveillance, and arrested as soon as he landed in Israel.32

Norway
On July 21, 1973, Ahmed Bouchiki, a Moroccan waiter in Lillehammer, Norway, was killed by Mossad agents while walking with his pregnant wife. He had been mistaken for Ali Hassan Salameh, one of the leaders of Black September, the Palestinian group responsible for the Munich massacre, who had been given shelter in Norway. The Mossad agents had used fake Canadian passports, which angered the Canadian government. Six Mossad agents were arrested, and the incident became known as the Lillehammer affair. Israel subsequently paid compensation to Bouchiki's family.383940
United Kingdom
In 1986, Mossad used an undercover agent to lure nuclear whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu from the United Kingdom to Italy where he was abducted and transported to Israel where he was tried for treason because of his role in exposing Israel's nuclear program.41
Mossad assisted the UK Intelligence organization MI5 following the 7/7 bombings in London. According to the 2007 edition of a book about the Mossad entitled &lt;U+201C&gt;Gideon&lt;U+2019&gt;s Spies,&lt;U+201D&gt; shortly after the 7/7 London underground bombings, the British domestic intelligence agency MI5 gathered evidence that a senior al-Qaeda operative known only by the alias Mustafa travelled in and out of England shortly before the 7/7 bombings. For months, the real identity of Mustafa remained unknown, but in early October 2005, Mossad told MI5 that this person was, in fact, Azhari Husin, a bomb-making expert with Jemaah Islamiyah, the main al-Qaeda affiliate in Southeast Asia. Husin studied in Britain and reports claim that he met the main 7/7 bomber, Mohammad Sidique Khan, in late 2001 in a militant training camp in the Philippines (see Late 2001). Meir Dagan, the head of Mossad, apparently also told MI5 that Husin helped plan and recruit volunteers for the bombings. Mossad claimed that Husin may have been in London at the time of the bombings, and then fled to al-Qaeda&lt;U+2019&gt;s main safe haven in the tribal area of Pakistan, where he sometimes hid after bombings. Husin was killed in a shootout in Indonesia in November 2005.42 Later official British government reports about the 7/7 bombings did not mention Husin. 43
Switzerland
In February 1998, five Mossad agents were caught wiretapping the home of a Hezbollah agent in a Bern suburb. Four agents were freed, but the fifth was tried, found guilty, sentenced to one year in prison, and following his release was banned from entering Switzerland for five years.44
Soviet Union/Russia
In February 1956, a friendly member of the Politburo provided the Mossad with a copy of Nikita Khrushchev's speech denouncing Joseph Stalin. The Mossad passed it on to the United States, which published the speech, embarrassing the USSR. This was a major intelligence coup that raised the prestige of the organization.45
In the summer of 2009 the Mossad was reported to have been involved in the hijacking of the MV Arctic Sea, allegedly carrying Russian missiles to Iran in the Baltic Sea.46
Asia
Pakistan
In a September 2003 news article, it was alleged by Rediff News (One of India's leading online portals) that General Pervez Musharaf, the then-President of Pakistan, decided to establish a clandestine relationship between Inter-Services Intelligence and Mossad via officers of the two services posted at their embassies in Washington, DC. The article further claimed that the ISI had offered Mossad information about Libyan, Syrian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian military which it had acquired through officers on official military deputations on those countries. However, no proof was offered to back up these allegations.47
Middle East
Egypt
Provision of intelligence for the cutting of communications between Port Said and Cairo in 1956.
Directed missions for Israeli spy Wolfgang Lotz in Egypt 1957-1965.
Provision of intelligence on the Egyptian Air Force for Operation Focus, the opening airstrike of the Six-Day War.
Operation Bulmus 6 - Intelligence assistance in the Commando Assault on Green Island, Egypt during the War of Attrition.
India
After discovering that an Indian nuclear scientist was trying to sell the Prithvi missile to Libya, the Mossad leaked the information to the Indian government, press, and the CIA, resulting in an investigation, as well as editorials in the Indian press about the need to monitor India's military exports.
Iran
Prior to the Iranian Revolution of 1978&lt;U+2013&gt;79 in Iran, SAVAK (Organization of National Security and Information), the Iranian secret police and intelligence service was created under the guidance of United States and Israeli intelligence officers in 1957 to protect the regime of the shah by arresting, torturing, and executing the dissidents (especially Leftists). After security relations between the United States and Iran grew more distant in the early 1960s which led the CIA training team to leave Iran, Mossad became increasingly active in Iran, &quot;training SAVAK personnel and carrying out a broad variety of joint operations with SAVAK.&quot;4849
The Mossad discovered Iran's covert nuclear program before it officially became known, and conducted espionage operations against nuclear facilities in the country.It was alleged by private intelligence agency Stratfor, based on &quot;sources close to Israeli intelligence&quot;, that Dr. Ardeshir Hosseinpour, a scientist involved in the Iranian nuclear program, was killed by the Mossad on January 15, 2007.50
A US intelligence official told The Washington Post that Israel orchestrated the defection of Iranian general Ali Reza Askari on February 7, 2007.51 This has been denied by Israeli spokesman Mark Regev. The Sunday Times reported that Askari had been a Mossad asset since 2003, and left only when his cover was about to be blown.52
Jordan
In what is thought to have been a reprisal action for a Hamas suicide-bombing in Jerusalem on July 30, 1997 that killed 16 Israelis, Benjamin Netanyahu authorised an operation against Khaled Mashal, the Hamas representative in Jordan.53 On the 25th September, 1997, Mashal was injected in the ear with a toxin (thought to have been the synthetic opiate Fentanyl54). Jordanian authorities apprehended two Mossad agents posing as Canadian tourists and detained a further six. In exchange for their release, an Israeli physician had to fly to Amman and administer an antidote to Mashal.The fall out from the failed assassination eventually led to the release of Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the founder and spiritual leader of the Hamas movement, and scores of Hamas prisoners. Mr. Netanyahu flew into Amman on the 29th September to apologize personally to King Hussein, but was met instead by the Kings brother, Crown Prince Hassan.55
Lebanon
The provision of intelligence and operational assistance in the 1973 Operation Spring of Youth special forces raid on Beirut. The sending of letter bombs to PFLP member Bassam Abu Sharif. Sharif was severely wounded, but survived.56
The targeted killing of Ali Hassan Salameh, the leader of Black September, on January 22, 1979 in Beirut by a car bomb.5758
The assassination of Ghassan Kanafani, also by a car bomb.59
Providing intelligence for the assassination of Abbas al-Musawi, secretary general of Hezbollah, in Beirut in 1992.60
The alleged assassination of Jihad Ahmed Jibril, the leader of the military wing of the PFLP-GC, in Beirut in 2002.61
The Mossad is suspected of establishing a large spy network in Lebanon, recruited from Druze, Christian, and Sunni Muslim communities, and officials in the Lebanese government, to spy on Hezbollah and its Iranian Revolutionary Guard advisors. Some have allegedly been active since 1982. In 2009, Lebanese Security Services supported by Hezbollah's intelligence unit, and working in collaboration with Syria, Iran, and possibly Russia, launched a major crackdown which resulted in the arrests of around 100 alleged Israeli spies.62
Syria
Eli Cohen, a spy for the Mossad, infiltrated the highest echelons of the Syrian government, was a close friend of the Syrian President, and was considered for the post of Minister of Defense. He gave his Mossad handlers a complete plan of the Syrian defenses on the Golan Heights, the Syrian Armed Forces order of battle, and a complete list of the Syrian military's weapons inventory. He also ordered the planting of trees by every Syrian fortified position under the pretext of shading soldiers, but the trees actually served as targeting markers for the Israel Defense Forces. He was discovered by Syrian and Soviet intelligence, tried in secret, and executed in 1965.63 His information played a crucial role during the Six Day War.
The alleged assassination of Muhammad Suleiman, the alleged head of Syria's nuclear program, in 2008. Suleiman was killed by a sniper firing from a boat while on a beach in Tartus.64
The alleged assassination of Imad Mughniyah, a senior leader of Hezbollah, with an exploding headrest in Damascus in 2008.65
United Arab Emirates
The Mossad is suspected of assassinating Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas military commander, in January 2010 at Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The team which carried out the killing is estimated, on the basis of CCTV and other evidence, to have consisted of at least 26 agents traveling on bogus passports. The operatives entered al-Mabhouh's hotel room, where Mabhouh was subjected to electric shocks and interrogated. The door to his room was reported to have been locked from the inside.6667686970 Although the UAE police and Hamas have declared Israel responsible for the assassination, no direct evidence linking Mossad to the crime has been found. The agents' bogus passports included six British passports, cloned from those of real British nationals resident in Israel and suspected by Dubai; five Irish passports, apparently forged from those of living individuals;71 forged Australian passports that raised fears of reprisal against innocent victims of identity theft;72 a genuine German passport and a false French passport. Emirati police say they have fingerprint and DNA evidence of some of the attackers, as well as retinal scans of 11 suspects recorded at Dubai airport.7374 Dubai's police chief has said &quot;I am now completely sure that it was Mossad,&quot; adding: &quot;I have presented the (Dubai) prosecutor with a request for the arrest of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the head of Mossad,&quot; for the murder.75
Africa
Morocco
In early 1991, two Mossad operatives infiltrated the Moroccan port of Casablanca and planted a tracking device on the freighter Al-Yarmouk, which was carrying a cargo of North Korean missiles bound for Syria. The ship was to be sunk by the Israeli Air Force, but the mission was later called off by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.76
Tunisia
The 1988 assassination of Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad).77
The alleged assassination of Salah Khalaf.78
Uganda
The provision of intelligence regarding Entebbe International Airport and grant of refueling rights in Kenya for Operation Entebbe in 1976.
South Africa
After the Mossad discovered the presence of two Iranian agents in Johannesburg on a mission to procure advanced weapons systems from Denel, a Mossad agent was deployed, and met up with a local Jewish contact. Posing as South African intelligence, they abducted the Iranians, drove them to a warehouse, and beat and intimidated them before forcing them to leave the country.79
Sudan
After the 1994 AMIA bombing, the Mossad began gathering intelligence for a raid by Israeli Special Forces on the Iranian embassy in Khartoum as retaliation. The operation was called off due to fears that another attack against worldwide Jewish communities might take place as revenge. The Mossad also assisted in Operation Moses, the evacuation of Ethiopian Jews to Israel from a famine-ridden region of Sudan in 1984, also maintaining a relationship with the Ethiopian government.
Zimbabwe
The Mossad secretly evacuated Zimbabewan Jews out of the country due to fears of persecution by the Zimbabwean government, which was allied with the Palestine Liberation Organization and Libya. The Mossad infiltrated the Zimbabwean government's Central Intelligence Organization, in response to the supply of plutonium from the Congo via Zimbabwe to North Korea, Syria, and Iran. 
Oceania
New Zealand
In July 2004, New Zealand imposed diplomatic sanctions on Israel over an incident in which two Australian based Israelis, Uriel Kelman and Eli Cara, who were allegedly working for Mossad, attempted to fraudulently obtain New Zealand passports by claiming the identity of a severely disabled man. Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom later apologized to New Zealand for their actions. New Zealand cancelled several other passports believed to have been obtained by Israeli agents.80 Both Kelman and Cara served half of their six month sentences and, upon release, were deported to Israel. Two others, an Israeli, Ze'ev Barkan, and a New Zealander, David Reznick, are believed to have been the third and fourth men involved in the passport affair but they both managed to leave New Zealand before being apprehended.81

Argentina claimed that the &quot;illicit and clandestine transfer of Eichmann from Argentine territory constitutes a flagrant violation of the Argentine State's right of sovereignty[.]&quot; Bass, Gary J. (2004.) The Adolf Eichmann Case: Universal and National Jurisdiction. In Stephen Macedo (ed,) Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes. (ch.4) Philadelphia: U.Penn. Press. In Eichmann's case, the most salient feature from the perspective of international law was the fact of Israeli law enforcement action in another state's territory without consent; the human element includes the dramatic circumstances of the capture by Mossad agents and the ensuing custody and transfer to Israel[.] Damrosch, Lori F. (2004.) Connecting the Threads in the Fabric of International Law. In Stephen Macedo (ed,) Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes. (ch.5) Philadelphia: U.Penn. Press. The principle of territorial integrity (in Art. 2(4) UN Charter) At its most obvious level this means that the exercise of enforcement jurisdiction within the territory of another state will be a violation of territorial integrity 32 Note 32: E.g. after Adolf Eichmann [...] was abducted from Argentina by a group of Israelis, now known to be from the Israeli Secret Service (Mossad), the Argentine Government lodged a complaint with the UN Security Council [...] It is however unclear whether as a matter of international law the obligation to make reparation for a violation of territorial sovereignty such as that involved in the Eichmann case includes an obligation to return the offender.
