Ryan Martinez (born August 27, 1987) is an American mixed martial artist who competes in Bellator's heavyweight division.
Background
Martinez was born in Greeley, Colorado. He grew up wrestling and had a very promising future, being a top ranked wrestler in the state of Colorado (third in the country as a senior) while at Greeley West High School, and a two-time All-American. The young Martinez was offered full-scholarships from many different colleges, but began getting involved with drugs and alcohol, and eventually dropped out of high school as he began dealing drugs.
Martinez was addicted to methamphetamines and was arrested once for drug trafficking. He spent three and a half years in prison and two years on parole. The time in prison was especially hard on Martinez because he missed the first two years of his daughter Taylor's life.
After his time in prison, he got a job as an ironworker and started to train MMA, which helped him to overcome his past.1
