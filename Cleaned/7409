Jerzy Janowicz, Jr. (; born 13 November 1990) is a Polish professional tennis player. Runner-up in two Junior Grand Slam tournaments, Janowicz rose to fame on the pro circuit following his run to the final of the 2012 Paris Masters, during which he defeated five top-20 players, including US Open champion and world no. 2 Andy Murray and world no. 9 Janko Tipsarevi&lt;U+0107&gt;. The run made him the second man to reach the final of a Masters tournament as a qualifier since Guillermo Ca&lt;U+00F1&gt;as in 2007, and the first unseeded man to make the final at the Paris Masters since Andrei Pavel in 2003. He fell in the final to David Ferrer in straight sets. However, the run to the 2012 Paris Masters final enabled Janowicz to become the Polish no. 1 and crack the top 30, with a ranking of world no. 26.1 His current coach is Finnish former tennis player Kim Tiilikainen. For his sport achievements, he received the Silver Cross of Merit 
Career
Juniors
Janowicz inherits his athleticism and height from his parents, who were both volleyball players.2 At the age of 10 or 11, his parents sold off their chain of sports stores and apartments to support their son's training, recognizing that he had a future in tennis from a young age.3 As a junior Janowicz posted a 59&lt;U+2013&gt;23 win/loss record and reached a combined ranking of No. 5 in the world in 2008.4 He reached the Boys' Singles final at the 2007 US Open and 2008 French Open, losing in straight sets to Ri&lt;U+010D&gt;ardas Berankis and Yang Tsung-Hua, respectively.5
Junior Slam results:
Australian Open: QF (2008)
French Open: F (2008)
Wimbledon: 2R (2008)
US Open: F (2007)
2012
Janowicz ended 2011 ranked 221 in the world.6 At the start of 2012 he couldn't play in the 2012 Australian Open due to lack of sponsorship.7 In February he was the runner up in a Challenger tournament in Wolfsburg, Germany. Later in the year he won three Challenger tournament finals. At the 2012 French Open he got as far as the third round of qualifying, but failed to make it into the actual tournament. At the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, he made it through the three rounds of qualifying to be in the main draw of a grand slam tournament for the first time, where he defeated a qualifier, Simone Bolelli, in the first round, Ernests Gulbis in the second, then lost to the 31st seed Florian Mayer in the third. At the 2012 US Open, he made it directly into a Grand Slam without having to compete in the qualifying rounds. He lost to young American wildcard Dennis Novikov.
Jerzy Janowicz, tennis player from Poland, Davis Cup &lt;U+0141&gt;&lt;U+00F3&gt;d&lt;U+017A&gt; 2012
In November 2012 Janowicz qualified for the main draw of the 2012 BNP Paribas Masters, an ATP 1000 tournament. He defeated the world No. 19, Philipp Kohlschreiber, in the first round, the world No. 14, Marin &lt;U+010C&gt;ili&lt;U+0107&gt;, in the second, and the world no. 3 and Olympic Gold medalist and US Open Champion, Andy Murray, in the third. He defeated Murray in three sets, saving one match point en route. He said afterwards, &quot;This was the most unbelievable day in my life.&quot;8 In the quarterfinals he defeated world No. 9, Janko Tipsarevi&lt;U+0107&gt;, to go on to play in the semifinals where he beat Frenchman and world No. 20 Gilles Simon to reach his first ATP tour-level final. He was the first qualifier to do this since Andrei Pavel in 2003 and the first player to reach the final on his ATP World Tour Masters 1000 debut since Harel Levy in 2000.9 In the final he was defeated by fourth seed David Ferrer, but afterwards said &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve got a lot of confidence right now. I learned if you have big heart and you want to do something amazing and you&lt;U+2019&gt;re going to fight for this, you have a big chance to make it.&quot;1011 His run led him to the world's Top 30 for the first time in his career.12
2013
Janowicz began his season at the Heineken Open in Auckland, New Zealand where he was seeded fifth; however, was knocked out in his opening match against American Brian Baker. He then competed for the first time in the main draw of the Australian Open, where he was the 24th seed, the first time he had been seeded at a Grand Slam tournament. He won his first two matches against Italian Simone Bolelli in straight sets, and Somdev Devvarman of India, against whom he had to recover from a two-set deficit to win in five. In his third round match, he lost to 10th seed Nicol&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Almagro in straight sets.
He played the Indian Wells Masters, where he reached the third round and was eventually eliminated by Richard Gasquet. He then played at the Miami Masters, where he was seeded 21st, but lost his first match in the second round to Brazilian, Thomaz Bellucci. At the Monte Carlo Masters, he again lost his first match in the first round to South African, Kevin Anderson. He continued to play at the Madrid Masters, where he won his first-round match against Sam Querrey, but was eliminated in the second round by eventual semifinalist, Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+0161&gt; Berdych. He then played at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where he reached the quarterfinals with consecutive wins over two top-10 players, Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He lost to Roger Federer in quarterfinal. Federer said: &quot;He obviously has a big game, unconventional shot selection at times, but really fun to watch... I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve got to be careful.&quot;13
At the French Open, he reached the third round, where he was eliminated in four sets by Stanislas Wawrinka.
At Wimbledon, he defeated Nicol&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Almagro for a spot in the round of 16 and J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen Melzer for a spot in his first career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He then beat fellow Pole &lt;U+0141&gt;ukasz Kubot in straight sets, becoming the first Polish man to reach a Grand Slam semifinal. There, he was beaten by world no. 2 Andy Murray in four sets. Janowicz had beaten Murray in their previous encounter.
Davis Cup
In 2009 Janowicz played a major role in Poland's 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 Davis Cup win over Great Britain at Liverpool's Echo Arena. Janowicz defeated Daniel Evans but lost to World No. 4 Andy Murray. In 2013 Jerzy Janowicz won the decisive fourth rubber for Poland with Slovenia to secure a Europe/Africa Zone Group I second round tie against South Africa. Janowicz fended off early resistance to defeat Grega &lt;U+017D&gt;emlja in straight sets at Centennial Hall in Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw. Earlier Janowicz won with Bla&lt;U+017E&gt; Kav&lt;U+010D&gt;i&lt;U+010D&gt;, with the final tie result at 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 to Poland.
Playing style
Janowicz is one of the fastest servers in game, hitting a first serve generally between 130 and 140 mph and often hitting a second serve from 115 to 120 mph. His ball toss is extremely high, even for a man who is 6 ft 8, producing a high trajectory.14 However, he is prone to a number of double faults. Janowicz also moves remarkably well considering his size, and hits powerful strokes from the back of the court and has an excellent drop shot. He has a double handed backhand, and is known to constantly mix up the game by playing numerous drop shots, slices and top spins.
