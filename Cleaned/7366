The Arrow or Hetz (, ) is a family of anti-ballistic missiles designed to fulfill an Israeli requirement for a theater missile defense system that would be more effective against ballistic missiles than the MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile. Jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States, development of the system began in 1986 and has continued since,1 drawing some contested criticism.2 Undertaken by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Boeing, it is overseen by the Israeli Ministry of Defence's &quot;Homa&quot; (, , &quot;rampart&quot;) missile defense agency and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.
The Arrow system consists of the joint production hypersonic Arrow anti-missile interceptor, Elta EL/M-2080 &quot;Green Pine&quot; early-warning AESA radar,3 the Tadiran Telecom &quot;Golden Citron&quot; (&quot;Citron Tree&quot;) C3I center,4 and the Israel Aerospace Industries &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; (&quot;Hazelnut Tree&quot;) launch control center. The system is transportable rather than mobile, as it can be moved to other prepared sites but cannot be set up just anywhere.5
Following construction and testing of the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator,6 production and deployment began with the Arrow 2 version of the missile. The Arrow is considered one of the most advanced missile defense programs currently in existence.78 It is the first operational missile defense system specifically designed and built to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles.910 Arrow 3 is expected in the near future.11 The first Arrow battery was declared fully operational in October 2000.12 Although several of its components have been exported, the Israeli Air Defense Network within the Israeli Air Force (IAF) of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is currently the sole user of the complete Arrow system.
Background
The Arrow program was launched in light of the acquisition by Arab states of long ranged surface-to-surface missiles.1314 The United States and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to co-fund it on May 6, 1986,1516 and in 1988 the United States Department of Defense Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) placed an order with Israel Aircraft Industries for the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator.1718 The Gulf War, which exposed the controversial performance19 of the Patriot missile against Iraqi &quot;Al Hussein&quot; missiles, gave further impetus to the development of the Arrow.20 It was initially designed to intercept missiles such as &quot;Al Hussein&quot;, its original - SS-1 &quot;Scud&quot;, USSR-made SS-21 &quot;Scarab&quot; of Syria, and China-made CSS-2 of Saudi Arabia.21 Yitzhak Rabin, then Prime Minister of Israel and Defense Minister of Israel, viewed the emerging missile threat as one of the most dangerous future threats on Israel's security.22 He said of the program that:  The Israeli Administration for the Development of Weapons and the Technological Industry, part of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, runs the Arrow development project under the &quot;Homa&quot; missile defense agency which binds together Israel's different defense industries. It is also commonly referred to as the IMDO - Israel Missile Defense Organization.
Funding
The multi-billion dollar development program of the Arrow is undertaken in Israel with the financial support of the United States. When the development program began, the projection for the total cost of its development and manufacture &lt;U+2014&gt; including the initial production of missiles &lt;U+2014&gt; was an estimated $1.6 billion.23 The price of a single Arrow missile was estimated at $3 million.24 Between 1989 and 2007 some $2.4 billion had been reportedly invested in the Arrow program, 50%&lt;U+2013&gt;80%25 of which was funded by the federal government of the United States.26 Israel contributes approximately $65 million annually.27

Criticism
A criticism of the concept of missile defense for Israel was aired by Dr. Reuven Pedatzur in a comprehensive study31 published in 1993 by the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies32 The arguments made in the study conformed to the opinions of numerous defense officials and analysts, and echoed many of the arguments made by the Strategic Defense Initiative critics in the United States.33
Pedatzur argued that it was exceedingly simple to fool an Arrow-type defensive system with simple, cheap, and easily installed countermeasures, which would render the Arrow system ineffective. He doubted Israel's defense industries could rise to the challenge of such a complex system, citing anonymous experts in the IDF who predicted that the system would not be available before 2010. He envisaged enormous costs, some $10 billion,34 that would distort budgeting priorities and divert funds from the vital enhancement of the IDF's warfighting capability, thus forcing a profound revision of Israel's national security doctrine. He further argued that even if effective against missiles with conventional, chemical or biological warheads, the Arrow would not be relevant against future threats of missiles with nuclear warheads, since it would never be able to supply hermetic defense and the impact of even a single nuclear warhead in Israel's densely populated urban area would be an existential threat to Israel.3536
At the same time, John E. Pike, who worked then with the Federation of American Scientists, stated that &quot;given technical problems with the systems radar and command system, coupled with its high development cost, the Arrow program may soon fall by the wayside&quot;.37
According to Dr. Uzi Rubin, first Director of IMDO, with the passage of time most of the pessimistic predictions have proven to be unfounded. Israel's defense industries overcame the technical challenge, the system's development was completed a full decade ahead of what was predicted, and there are no indications that the expenditures for the Arrow harmed other IDF procurement plans to any degree whatsoever.38 Rubin insists that Israel's missile defense is now an established fact and that most of the warnings issued by critics have failed to materialize.39 Pedatzur, however, remains unconvinced.4041

Arrow 1
The first launch of the Arrow interceptor took place on August 9, 1990, designed to test the missile's control and guidance systems. The test came to a halt seconds after take off and the missile was intentionally destroyed due to fears it might go off track and hit a settled location. This was caused by the failure of the ground tracking radars to track the missile's trajectory.42 Test number two took place on March 25, 1991. Designed to check missile components during launch, it was conducted from a ship at sea. Once again a missile malfunction resulted in the abortion of the experiment.43 A third test, designed to examine the Arrow's interception capabilities, was conducted on October 31, 1991. The missile was once again launched from a ship at sea, and was once more aborted because of a repeat of previous malfunctions.44
On September 23, 1992, in another test of the missile components during launch, the systems finally operated as planned and the Arrow reached its designated point in the sky, 45 seconds after launch. As planned, the missile was then destroyed. This successful experiment ended the system's preliminary testing phase.45 The fifth, sixth, and seventh tests took place on February 28, July 14, and October 14, 1993 respectively. During these, the Arrow managed to pass in close proximity to the target missiles, thereby proving its ability to intercept surface-to-surface missiles.46 During test number eight on March 1, 1994, the missile was not launched due to a ground computer failure.47 The ninth test launch on June 12, 1994, also known as ATD#1 (Arrow Demonstration Test 1), saw an Arrow 1 successfully intercept a target missile launched from a ship anchored in the middle of the Mediterranean.4849
The Arrow 1 was a two stage solid propellant missile, with an overall length of , a body diameter of , and a launch weight of around . It was estimated that the second stage had a length of , and that it had inertial and command update mid-course guidance, with a terminal infrared focal plane array. The missile was described as being relatively high-speed and maneuverable, with thrust vectoring in the both stages. The range capability has been described as around .50 On the other hand, the Arrow 1 could be a single stage missile.51 Development of the &quot;big and cumbersome&quot;52 Arrow 1 then ceased and further research continued with the &quot;smaller, faster and more lethal&quot; Arrow 2.5354
Arrow 2
 Two successful tests (designated IIT#21 and IIT#22) of the steering, control and cruising systems were conducted without target missiles on July 30, 1995 and February 20, 1996.5556 Two successful interceptions took place on August 20, 1996 and March 11, 1997, and were designated AIT#21 and AIT#22.5758 thumb|upright=0.9|left|alt=Arrow 2 launch in August 1996.|Arrow 2 launch in August 1996. Another interception test (AIT#23) was conducted on August 20, 1997, but the missile was destroyed when the its steering system malfunctioned.5960 The fault was corrected in time to ensure the success of AST#3,6162 the first comprehensive test of the entire system. On September 14, 1998, all system components successfully countered a computer-simulated threat.6364 On November 29, 1998, Israel Aerospace Industries delivered the first operational Arrow 2 interceptor to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.65
A full system interception test (AST#4) was held on November 1, 1999. During this test the Arrow system located, tracked and intercepted a TM-91C target missile simulating a &quot;Scud&quot; missile, launched on a very steep trajectory from a ship located offshore.6667 The IAI TM-91C target missile was itself based on the Arrow 1 interceptor.68 On March 14, 2000, the first complete Arrow 2 battery was rolled out in a ceremony at Palmachim Airbase.69 In his speech, then IAF commander Aluf Eitan Ben Eliyahu said: 
Another Arrow 2 test (AST#5) took place on September 14, 2000, this time with a new target missile, the Rafael Advanced Defense Systems &quot;Black Sparrow&quot;.70 This airborne ballistic target missile, launched by an IAF F-15 towards Israel's coastline at a ballistic trajectory simulating an aggressor &quot;Scud&quot;, was intercepted and destroyed.7172 Consequently, the following month saw the Palmachim Arrow battery declared operational by the Israeli Air Defense Network.73 The &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; has since been used as the aggressor target in the AST#6, AST#9, and AST#10 tests.74 On August 27, 2001 (AST#6), the Arrow system successfully intercepted its target at some  from shore, the highest and farthest that the Arrow 2 had been tested to date.7576 In October 2002 the second battery was declared operational.77

A successful test of the Arrow 2 block-2 took place on January 5, 2003 (AST#8). Four missiles were launched towards four simulated targets in order to examine the interceptor's performance during special flight conditions as well as system performance during a sequence of launches.787980 The test did not include actual interceptions.81 Another successful test held on December 16, 2003 (AST#9), examined the system's ability to intercept and destroy incoming missiles at significantly high altitudes,82 around .83 Reportedly, AST#8 and AST#9 also tested integration of the Arrow with Patriot batteries.8485
On July 29, 2004, Israel and the United States carried out a joint test at the Naval Air Station Point Mugu (NAS Point Mugu) Missile Test Center in California, in which the Arrow interceptor was launched against a real &quot;Scud-B&quot; missile. The test represented a realistic scenario that could not have been tested in Israel due to test-field safety restrictions.86 To enable the test a full battery was shipped to Point Mugu. The &quot;Green Pine&quot; radar and command-and-control systems were deployed at the base, while the Arrow launcher was installed  offshore on an island that forms part of the test range.87 The test was a success, with the interceptor destroying the &quot;Scud&quot; that flew a  trajectory88 at an altitude of ,89 west of San Nicolas Island.90 This was the twelfth Arrow interceptor test and the seventh test of the complete system, the first interception of a real &quot;Scud&quot;.91 This significant test became known as the AST USFT#1.92 Following this test, then Defense Minister of Israel, Shaul Mofaz, said: 
AST USFT#2 was conducted at NAS Point Mugu a month later, on August 26. This test was aimed at examining the Arrow's ability to detect a splitting warhead of a separating ballistic missile.93 It detected the true target, but a technical malfunction reportedly prevented it from maneuvering to strike it,94 leading to a suspension of testing.95 Testing was resumed in December 2005, when the system successfully intercepted a target at an unspecified but reported record low altitude.96 This test (AST#10) was the fourteenth test of the Arrow missile and the ninth test of the complete system.97
Block-3
 In February 11, 2007 an Arrow 2 block-398 successfully intercepted and destroyed a &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; target missile simulating a ballistic missile at high altitude.99 It was the first so-called distributed weapon system test conducted in Israel, which required two Arrow units deployed some  apart to share data on incoming threats and coordinate launching assignments. It was also the first time the Link 16 data distribution system was used to connect two Arrow units, although the system had been used in previous tests to connect Arrow and Patriot batteries.100 Furthermore, an improved launcher was used.101
A precursor of the next block was launched without a target on March 26, 2007 in order to gather information on its flight and performance,102 introducing unspecified modifications to its hardware and electronics and reduced manufacturing costs by some 20%.103 Arieh Herzog, Director of IMDO, has said: &quot;Our Arrow operational system can without a doubt deal with all of the operational threats in the Middle East, particularly in Iran and Syria.&quot;104
Block-4
On April 15, 2008 the Arrow weapon system successfully detected and made a simulated intercept of a new target missile,105 the &quot;Blue Sparrow&quot;, a successor of the &quot;Black Sparrow&quot; capable of simulating &quot;Scud-C/D&quot; missiles106 and reportedly the Iranian Shahab-3 as well.107 During the test, a target missile was launched from an IAF F-15 at a height of 90,000 feet (27.5 km). The missile split into multiple warheads, making it harder to intercept it. Nevertheless, the Arrow's radar tracked the missile, simulating an intercept.108 In September 2008 the IDF attempted a test of actual Arrow 2 block-4 missile against the &quot;Blue Sparrow&quot;. The drill had to be aborted, however, when the target missile malfunctioned shortly after launch.109 Eventually the Arrow 2 block-4 was successfully tested against the &quot;Blue Sparrow&quot; on April 7, 2009.110111112 The test also witnessed the first integration of the Arrow with the U.S. AN/TPY-2 X band radar deployed at Dimona Radar Facility.113
A July 22, 2009, joint test of the Arrow 2 block-4 against an airborne target missile with a range of over  once again at the NAS Point Mugu,114 was reportedly aborted after the missile failed to establish a communications link.115 A target had been released from a C-17 Globemaster III aircraft,116117 the radar detected the target and transferred its tracks,118 but the interceptor was not launched.119 The aborted test was widely referred to as a failure,120121 however objectives of interoperability with other ballistic missile defense systems were achieved.122 The test continued under a simulative mode, with by the Aegis destroyer, USS Benfold (DDG-65) which also participated in the test.123124
Arrow 3
By August 2008 the United States and Israeli governments have initiated development of an upper-tier component to the Israeli Air Defense Network, known as Arrow 3, &quot;with a kill ratio of around 99 percent&quot;.125 The development is based on an architecture definition study conducted in 2006-2007, determining the need for the upper-tier component to be integrated into Israel's ballistic missile defense system. According to Arieh Herzog, the main element of this upper tier will be an exoatmospheric interceptor, to be jointly developed by IAI and Boeing.126 Lieutenant General Patrick J. O&lt;U+2019&gt;Reilly, Director of the Missile Defense Agency, said:  The new component will also require the integration of longer range detection, tracking and discrimination capability, beyond what the &quot;Green Pine&quot; and &quot;Super Green Pine&quot; radars employed with the Arrow 2 are providing. Among the advanced sensors considered for Israel's future multi-tier system, are airborne electro-optical sensors deployed on high flying unmanned aerial vehicles and future enhanced &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars, as well as the AN/TPY-2 radar already deployed in Israel, and operated by U.S. forces.127
Israel Aerospace Industries announced in June 2009, that the Arrow 3 patented128 exoatmospheric interception method includes a two stage interceptor, like the Arrow 2, but purely based on hit-to-kill technology.129 IAI also displayed a full-sized model of the Arrow 3 at the June 2009 Paris Air Show.130 Arrow 3 should be able to intercept ballistic missiles, including intermediate-range ballistic missiles,131 at altitudes of over ,132 and in greater ranges.133 It is slightly smaller than the Arrow 2,134 faster,135 and may have a reduced 30-year life-cycle cost.136 Reportedly it will only cost $1.5&lt;U+2013&gt;$2 million per unit,137 while program cost is estimated at some $700&lt;U+2013&gt;$800 million over three years.138 It is expected to be operational by 2012.139 Lieutenant General O'Reilly, however, expressed concern about the schedule proposed by the Israelis.140 Reportedly, the U.S. will provide the full funding for the development and production of the Arrow 3.141
Specifications
upright=0.54|thumb|alt=Arrow 2 at the Paris Air Show. |Arrow 2 at the Paris Air Show. The Arrow system was exclusively designed to intercept medium- and short-range ballistic missiles, with an eye on the advanced missile programs of Iran and Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It is not intended to intercept either military aircraft or artillery rockets, the second of which are relatively small and short ranged. In contrast to both THAAD, RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (exoatmospheric), and MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3 (low altitude), the Arrow intercepts its targets in the high stratosphere, high enough so that any nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons do not scatter over Israel.142 The developers' intention was to perform the destruction sequence away from populated locations.143 According to Dr. Uzi Rubin, the missile was tested to determine whether chemical warfare agents would reach the ground should such a warhead be intercepted. The conclusion was that nothing would reach the ground if the warhead is destroyed above the jet stream, which flows from west to east and would therefore blow any chemical residue back to its point of origin.144145 Nevertheless, Arrow is also capable of low altitude interception, as well as multi&lt;U+2014&gt; tactical ballistic missiles interception.146
The two-stage missile is equipped with solid propellant booster and sustainer rocket motors.147 The missile uses an initial burn to carry out a vertical hot launch from the container and a secondary burn to sustain the missile's trajectory towards the target at a maximum speed of Mach 9, or .148 Thrust vector control is used in the boost and sustainer phases of flight.149 At the ignition of the second stage sustainer motor, the first stage assembly separates.150 The Arrow missile is launched before the threat missile's trajectory and intercept point are accurately known.151 As more trajectory data becomes available, the optimum intercept point is more precisely defined, towards which the missiles is then guided.152 The  kill vehicle section of the missile, containing the warhead, fusing and the terminal seeker, is equipped with four moving delta aerodynamic control fins to give low altitude interception capability.153 The dual mode missile seeker has a passive infrared seeker for the acquisition and tracking of tactical ballistic missiles and an active radar seeker used to home on air breathing targets at low altitudes.154 The infrared seeker is an indium antimonide focal plane array.155 The kill vehicle is designed to achieve a hit-to-kill interception, but if this is not achieved, the proximity fuze will direct the warhead fragments at the target shortly before reaching the closest point to the target.156 The high explosive directed blast fragmentation warhead is capable of destroying a target within a  radius.157
According to Dov Raviv, a senior developer dubbed &quot;the father of the Arrow anti-ballistic missile&quot;,158159160 a single Arrow interceptor has a 90% probability of destroying a target missile at the highest altitude possible.161162163 In case of failure two more interceptors can be launched towards the target at short time intervals.164165166 If the first of these destroys the target, the second can be directed to another target.167 Using this technique, three independent interception possibilities are provided which raise the interception probability from 90% to 99.9%, thus satisfying the leakage rate requirement.168169 The Arrow also has the capability to simultaneously intercept a salvo of more than five incoming missiles, with the target missiles arriving within a 30-second span.170 Such capability is currently possessed only by the United States and Russia.171 According to Raviv, the Arrow can discriminate between a warhead and a decoy.172
Each battery is equipped with typically four to eight launch trailers, its manning requires about 100 personnel.173 Each trailer-mounted erector-launcher weighs 174 when loaded with six launch tubes with ready-to-fire missiles.175 After firing the launchers can be reloaded in an hour.176

Green Pine
Elta, a subsidiary of IAI, was awarded the contract to develop and manufacture the EL/M-2080 &quot;Green Pine&quot; (, ) radar in 1992.178 The &quot;Green Pine&quot; was developed from the Elta &quot;Music&quot; phased array radar,179 presented in November 1994,180 rolled out in 1995,181 and turned operational in November 1998.182 In 2000 it was revealed that the &quot;Green Pine&quot; detected the launch of a Syrian &quot;Scud-D&quot; missile from its base outside Aleppo in northern Syria, and tracked its full trajectory until its impact point, some  in the southern desert.183 The &quot;Green Pine&quot; reportedly detected and tracked similar launches of Syrian &quot;Scuds&quot; also in 2005184 and in 2008.185
The &quot;Green Pine&quot; is an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) solid state radar operating at L band in the range 500 MHz to 1,000 MHz,186 or 1,000 MHz to 2,000 MHz.187 It operates in search, detection, tracking, and missile guidance modes simultaneously.188 It is capable of detecting targets at ranges of up to about  and is able to track targets at speeds over . The radar illuminates the target and guides the Arrow missile to within  of the target.189 The effective radiated power of the &quot;Green Pine&quot; also makes it a possible candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon.190
The radar system includes a  wide by  high191 trailer-mounted rotatable antenna array, a power generator, a cooling system and a radar control center.192 The radar comprises 2,000 transmit-receive modules and weighs .193 Its deployment at a new operational site takes &quot;less than 24 hours&quot;.194
An advanced version of the radar, called &quot;Super Green Pine&quot;,195 &quot;Green Pine&quot; Block-B,196 or &quot;Great Pine&quot; (, ), is to take the place of the original &quot;Green Pine. As of 2008 both versions were active.197 The &quot;Super Green Pine&quot; is believed to produce double the power output,198 extending detection range to about .199200201
The Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation is also an acknowledged derivative of the original &quot;Green Pine&quot;.202
Golden Citron
The &quot;Golden Citron&quot; (, ) truck-mounted net-centric open systems architecture203 Battle Management Command, Control, Communication &amp; Intelligence Center204 can control up to 14 intercepts simultaneously.205 As of 2007 it was one of the world's most advanced net-centric systems.206 The system provides fully automatic as well as Human-in-the-Loop options at every stage207 of battle operation management.208 It is also capable of interoperability with other theater missile defense systems and C3I systems.209 Notably Link 16, TADIL-J, communications were being altered to allow interoperability with Patriot fire control units. Assigned targets can be handed over to the Patriot's AN/MPQ-53 fire control radar. Tests carried out by the U.S and Israel have successfully linked the Arrow with both U.S and Israeli versions of the Patriot.210
The &quot;Citron Tree&quot; has three banks of operator consoles laid out in a U shape. In the center sits the officer in command who oversees the engagement, but also has links to the other parts of the battery as well as to IAF headquarters. On the commander's right sits the engagement officer, who ensures that targets are assigned to other engagement officers sitting on the right-hand leg of the U. Each is assigned a geographical area to defend and two of the officers are more senior as they have an overview of Patriot batteries. To the left of the commander is the resource officer, who monitors the status and readiness of the missiles. On the left of the U sits the sky picture officer, who is in contact with the Home Front Command and uses the center's ability to predict impact point to alert the civil authorities. Also at these consoles are an intelligence officer and an after-action / debrief officer, who uses recordings as it is impossible to absorb all the information during engagements.211 All in all, the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; is manned by 7&lt;U+2013&gt;10 operators.212
Brown Hazelnut
The &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; (, ) launch control center is located at the launch site,213 up to  from the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; fire control center.214 It employes microwave and radio data and voice communications links to the &quot;Green Pine&quot; and &quot;Golden Citron&quot;. The launch method is a vertical hot launch from a sealed canister,215216 providing all-azimuth coverage.217 &quot;Brown Hazelnut&quot; also has missile maintenance and diagnostic capabilities.218

Deployment
The first operational Arrow battery was deployed in March 2000 in Palmachim Airbase, near the city of Rishon LeZion, south of the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. It was declared operational in October 2000, and reached its full capacity in March 2001.239 Deployment of the second battery at Ein Shemer,240 near the city of Hadera, Haifa District, northern Israel, was delayed by strong opposition from local residents who feared its radar would be hazardous to their health.241 The situation was eventually resolved and Israel's second battery completed its deployment, turned operational and linked up with first battery in October 2002. In 2007, however, the IDF has reportedly decided to modify its missile defense doctrine and in order to counter possible Syrian and Iranian missile barrages and has modified its deployment of the Arrow in northern Israel.242
Israel had originally planned to deploy two Arrow 2 batteries but has since sought and won promises of funding for a third battery.243 Some reports state that a third battery is already deployed,244 or in development in the south,245 while others claim that a decision on deployment of a third battery has not yet been made, although it is under discussion for service entry in 2012.246 Unconfirmed reports suggest that the first battery is actually in the southern Negev desert, at the Negev Nuclear Research Center near the town of Dimona.247 Another report states that Israel plans to deploy not one, but two additional Arrow 2 batteries to defend the country's southern region, also covering sensitive sites such as the Negev Nuclear Research Center.248 The IDF plans to procure 50249&lt;U+2013&gt;100 interceptors for each battery.250 As of 1998, a battery was estimated to cost about $170 million.251252253
Export
Apart from Israel no country has yet to purchase a full Arrow system, although India had acquired and deployed two &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars around July 2002 and another one in August 2005.254 The Indian government has sought to purchase the Arrow system since 1999,255 however in early 2002 the U.S. vetoed Israel's request to sell the Arrow 2 missiles to India,256257 exercising its right as a major funding contributor.258 U.S. officials argued that the sale would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).259 Although the Arrow 2 could possibly achieve a range of , it is designed for intercepts at shorter ranges, and it is unclear whether it could carry a  payload to this range specified in the MTCR.260261
South Korea was also considering buying two &quot;Green Pine&quot; radars, which would become operational in 2012.262263 Reportedly, South Korea has finally preferred two &quot;Super Green Pine&quot; radars at a cost of $83 million each over its counterpart - ThalesRaytheonSystems' M3R radars.264265 Turkey also planned to buy anti-missile air defense systems worth more than $1 billion. The Arrow was considered a potential contender,266 however Turkey has apparently chosen the Patriot PAC-3.267
In the late 1990s officials of Jordan have expressed concern that any conflagration between Israel and Iraq or Iran would impact its territory. The problem becomes more difficult for Jordan when the warheads are not conventional. Therefore Benjamin Netanyahu, during his first term of office as Prime Minister of Israel, reportedly offered Jordan &quot;a defensive umbrella of Arrow 2&quot;. Without allowing Israel to forward deploy the Arrow launchers close to the Iraqi border, the other option is for Israel to sell Jordan the Arrow system. This is most likely what Prime Minister Netanyahu meant above. In May 1999 Israel reportedly requested U.S. approval for selling Arrow batteries to Jordan, but apparently no such approval has been given yet.268
In the past, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Singapore were mentioned as then potential foreign customers of the Arrow system.269270 Netherlands reportedly expressed interest in the &quot;Golden Citron&quot; C3I center in November 1999.271
For the United States, the Arrow has provided important technical and operational data.272 It remains a key element in the Missile Defense Agency&lt;U+2019&gt;s plan for a layered missile defense architecture, and an example of a successful, affordable program. At the moment, however, the United States does not have any plans to procure and deploy the Arrow.273 Nevertheless in September 2009 the Arrow system was mentioned by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright among the alternative to the proposed U.S. missile defense assets in Europe.274275 Currently the Arrow system is being incorporated into U.S. anti-ballistic capability in Europe, they said.276
