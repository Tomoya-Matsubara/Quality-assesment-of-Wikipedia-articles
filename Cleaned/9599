Andrews' performance has been criticized since she joined Fox Sports' MLB coverage in 2012. For example,21 Andrews during postseason trophy presentations, has been accused of showing an extreme lack of knowledge by reading off notes.

Stalking incident
In 2008, Michael David Barrett, 46, filmed Andrews in her hotel room through peepholes at the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Radisson Airport Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. On July 16, 2009, one of these videos, in which Andrews appeared totally nude, was posted online and quickly went viral.26 Barrett was arrested on October 2, 2009, by the FBI for interstate stalking, and pleaded guilty to the charges on December 15, 2009. A second tape of Andrews was discovered on Barrett's computer by authorities in which she is nude in her room at the Radisson Airport Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This tape was never made public.2728 On March 15, 2010, Barrett was sentenced to 30 months in prison, three years of probation, $5,000 in fines, and $7,366 in restitution.29 He served his sentence at the Seattle Community Corrections and was released on July 3, 2012.30
Andrews has sued Barrett, Marriott International, Radisson Hotels, and five other entities for negligence and invasion of privacy in connection with the secret videotaping.31 In her lawsuit against Marriott, Andrews alleged that hotel employees gave Barrett the dates she would be at a hotel and a room next to hers.32 In 2011 Andrews worked with U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, to enact a new federal anti-stalking law.33 As of July 2011 Andrews still was trying to get the video removed from the internet.34
In March 2013, Andrews' lawyers filed a motion in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking to quash a subpoena from Marriott &quot;seeking her payroll records, contracts, performance reviews, any disciplinary reports, as well as other employment information from her current employer, Fox.&quot;35 The attorneys say Marriott is also seeking &quot;physician letters, notes, annual physicals, and other related medical records&quot; and that the request is an attempt to &quot;harass and embarrass&quot; Andrews.36
