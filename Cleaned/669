The Battle of Achelous took place in 1359 near the river Achelous, in Aetolia, modern Greece fought between Albanian troops, under Peter Losha, and forces of the Despotate of Epirus, under Nikephoros II Orsini. The Albanians defeated Orsini's army, which suffered massive casualties during the battle. The battle established two despotates from regions previously part of the Despotate of Epirus: the Despotate of Arta and the Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto.
Prelude
Since the early 14th century the power of the Despotate of Epirus had been decreasing while the Albanian rulers had been increasing their control over many areas of the despotate.1 Nikephoros II Orsini, Despot of Epirus decided to establish closer relations to the Serbian Empire by dropping his previous wife Maria Cantacuzena and marrying the sister of Stefan Uro&lt;U+0161&gt; IV Du&lt;U+0161&gt;an's widow. The Albanians of the Despotate threatened revolt if Orsini married Helena of Bulgaria's sister and didn't recall Maria, who was part of the Cantacuzene family allied with them.2 Orsini was forced to recall Maria but decided to wage war against the Albanians to stop their increasing power in the despotate.3
Battle
Nikephoros II Orsini gathered his forces and marched against the Albanians in the regions they had settled in Aetolia, modern western Greece. The Albanians gathered their forces and under the leadership of Peter Losha fought against Orsini in the late spring of 1359 near the Achelous river. The Albanians won the battle. Orsini was killed and his whole army was destroyed.456
Aftermath
After Nikephoros's death the remaining major towns in the Despotate Epirus, being under risk of capture by the Albanian troops, submitted to Simeon Uro&lt;U+0161&gt; and the remaining areas of the despotate were divided between him and Radoslav Hlapen.7 Simeon unable to expel the Albanian leaders tried to maintain indirect control of the Despotate of Epirus by recognizing as Despots of the regions of Arta and Aetolia Peter Losha and Gjin Bua Shpata, who created the Despotate of Arta and the Despotate of Angelokastron and Lepanto.8
Although most of Epirus was under Albanian rule due to their tribal structure and lack of central authority the Albanians didn't replace any existing Greek or Serbian rule with a centralized Albanian state.9 As an aftermath by 1366-7 only the city of Ioannina wasn't under Albanian control.10
