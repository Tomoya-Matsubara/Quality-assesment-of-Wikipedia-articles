Sheffield Wednesday Football Club are a football club based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, who are currently competing in the Football League One in the 2010/11 season, in England. Sheffield Wednesday are one of the oldest professional clubs in the world and the third oldest in the English league. The Wednesday, as they were named until 1929, were founding members of The Football Alliance in 1889, and its first champions that inaugural season. The Wednesday joined The Football League three years later when the leagues merged. Sheffield Wednesday were also one of the founding members of The Premier League in 1992. Their main rivals are Sheffield United, the two clubs having contested the Steel City derby on a regular basis for some 100 years. Barnsley, Leeds United, Bradford City, Huddersfield Town, Rotherham United, Chesterfield and Doncaster Rovers are also local rivals.The Owls have spent the majority of their history in the top flight of English football since joining the Football League in 1892. They have won four League titles, three FA Cups and one League Cup, but their League Cup triumph in 1991 is their only major trophy since 1935. They did reach both domestic cup finals in 1993, but lost 2-1 to Arsenal at Wembley on both occasions.
They play their home matches at Hillsborough Stadium in the north-western suburb of Hillsborough. It is a 39,812 all-seater stadium built in 1899 when the lease expired at their previous ground of Olive Grove.1
History
Early years
The club was a cricket club when it formed in 1820 as The Wednesday Cricket Club (named after the day of the week when they played their matches). A meeting on the evening of Wednesday 4 September 1867 at the Adelphi Hotel established a footballing side to keep the team together and fit during the winter months. They played their first match against The Mechanics on 19 October the same year.2
It soon became apparent that football would come to eclipse the cricketing side of the club. On 1 February 1868, Wednesday played their first competitive football match as they entered the Cromwell Cup, a four-team competition for newly formed clubs. They went on to win the cup, beating the Garrick Club 1-0 after extra time in the final at Bramall Lane.3
Charles Clegg joined Wednesday in the 1870s, starting a relationship that would last the rest of his life and eventually lead to his becoming the club's chairman. He also became president and chairman of the Football Association and known as the &quot;Napoleon of Football&quot;.4 In 1876 they acquired Scot James Lang. Although he was not employed by the club, he was given a job by a member of the Sheffield Wednesday board that had no formal duties. He is now acknowledged as the first professional football player in England.5
The 1880s saw two major events that radically changed the face of the club. In 1882 the cricket and football clubs parted company;6 the cricket club went later out of existence in 1925. The football club turned professional in 1887 after pressure from players threatening to defect to other clubs. Sheffield Wednesday won their first game as a professional club against The Mechanics 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0.
Professional football
The move to professionalism took the club from Bramall Lane, which had taken a share of the ticket revenue, to the new Olive Grove.7 In 1889 the club became founder members of the Football Alliance, of which they were the first champions in a season where they also reached the 1890 FA Cup Final, losing 6&lt;U+2013&gt;1 to Blackburn Rovers at Kennington Oval, London. Despite finishing the following season bottom of the Alliance, they were eventually elected to the expanded Football League in 1892. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1896, beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 at Crystal Palace.
Due to an expansion of the local railway lines, the club was told that they would have to find a new ground for the 1899&lt;U+2013&gt;1900 season.8 After a difficult search the club finally bought some land in the village of Owlerton, which at the time was several miles outside the Sheffield city boundaries. Construction of a new stadium (now known as Hillsborough Stadium) was completed within months and the club was secured for the next century. In a strong decade Wednesday won the League twice in the 1902&lt;U+2013&gt;03 and 1903&lt;U+2013&gt;04 seasons and the FA Cup again in 1907, beating Everton 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1, again at Crystal Palace. After this the club went through a relatively fallow period for another two decades.
The club was almost relegated in the 1927&lt;U+2013&gt;28 season, but with 17 points in the last 10 matches they pulled off a great escape, rising from bottom to 14th. Wednesday went on to win the League title the following season (1928&lt;U+2013&gt;29), which started a run that saw the team finishing lower than third only once until 1936.9 The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club's history in 1935.
Post-war turmoil
The 1950s saw Wednesday unable to consistently hold on to a position in the top flight. After being promoted back up in 1950, they were relegated three times, although each time they bounced back up by winning the Second Division the following season. The decade ended on a high note with the team finally finishing in the top half of the First Division for the first time since the Second World War.
This led to a decade of successfully remaining in the First Division, which included a run to the FA Cup Final in 1966 &lt;U+2013&gt; notable in that Wednesday played all their ties away from home. Off the field the club was embroiled in the British betting scandal of 1964 in which three of their players, Peter Swan, David Layne and Tony Kay, were accused of match fixing and betting against their own team in an away game at Ipswich Town. The three were subsequently convicted and, on release from prison, banned from football for life.10 The three were reprieved in the early 1970s with Swan and Layne returning to Hillsborough and though their careers were virtually over Swan at least played some league games for The Owls.
Wednesday were relegated at the end of the 1969&lt;U+2013&gt;70 season, starting the darkest period in the club's history. After going into free-fall they dropped to the Third Division for the first time in their history and were marooned there for five seasons. The club was almost relegated to the Fourth Division in 1976, but a revival under the management of Jack Charlton, and the aid of coach Tony Toms, and after Charlton resigned in 1983, Howard Wilkinson, saw them return to the First Division in 1984.
Modern highs and lows
Sheffield Wednesday spent the majority of the 1980s and 1990s in the top tier of English football. 1990&lt;U+2013&gt;91 was the only season out of sixteen in a row that Wednesday spent in a lower division, but the season is best remembered by fans for Wednesday's swift return to the top flight under the management of Ron Atkinson and their League Cup victory over Manchester United to win their first major trophy for over 50 years. This League Cup triumph was the last domestic cup to be won by a club competing outside the top level of English football. The following season Wednesday finished third in the league. The 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93 season established Sheffield Wednesday as a top club as they visited Wembley four times during the season &lt;U+2013&gt; a League Cup final and an FA Cup semi-final, final and replay. In the FA Cup semi-finals they recorded a historic win over the city rivals Sheffield United, 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1. However Wednesday failed to win any silverware, losing to Arsenal in both League and FA Cup finals, the latter after Andy Linighan's late extra-time winner in the replay to give The Gunners the victory.
 Wednesday's fortunes took a turn for the worse when a succession of managers failed to maintain this form, first David Pleat and later Danny Wilson spent small fortunes building squads that were ultimately ineffective, and the club's debts got out of control as a result.11 Danny Wilson was sacked in March 2000 and his assistant Peter Shreeves took temporary charge but was unable to stave off relegation. The club's flirtation with relegation continued in Division One and after yet more managerial changes Chris Turner was hired as boss and made a strong effort to rejuvenate the side. However, a failure to beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the penultimate game of the 2002&lt;U+2013&gt;03 season condemned them to another relegation.
After narrowly avoiding yet another relegation in 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04 and a poor start to the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 Football League One campaign, Turner was replaced by former Southampton manager Paul Sturrock. Sturrock revitalised Sheffield Wednesday's fortunes and they finished fifth in League One at the end of the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 season, qualifying for the promotion playoffs. Over 40,000 Owls fans travelled to Cardiff to watch Wednesday beat Hartlepool United 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2 after extra time in the playoff final, and return to the Championship.12 Sturrock guided Sheffield Wednesday to Championship survival in 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 but was sacked after a poor start to the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 season and replaced by Brian Laws, who led Wednesday to a 9th place finish in the Championship after having an outside chance of reaching the play offs until the penultimate game of the season.13 The following season began with Wednesday's worst ever start to a season, losing six league games in a row. Chairman Dave Allen resigned in November 2007,14 and Wednesday avoided relegation with a win on the last day of the season.15 The Owls improved in 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 and 12th place with the best home defensive record in the division. Halfway through Sheffield Wednesday's 2009-10 season Brian Laws was sacked, and was replaced by Alan Irvine. On the last day of the season, needing a win to stay up, Wednesday drew 2–2 with Crystal Palace and were relegated to League One.16
On Friday 23 July 2010, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs presented a winding up petition to the club to which the club has responded by stating that they are 'surprised and disappointed' at the decision.17 The club survived the petition with the help of a bank loan, but the crisis sparked anger amongst the fanbase leading to calls for the board to resign.. This first order was followed by two more and thus began a summer and autumn of considerable anxiety for Owls fans, who feared an inevitable slide into administration. However after days of speculation, it was announced on Radio Sheffield's &quot;Football Heaven&quot; programme on 8 October that &lt;U+00A3&gt;2m had been transferred to the club from a consortium still in advance talks with the club.
Name origins and nicknames
Sheffield Wednesday are the only English League club with a day of the week in their name.
The club was initially a cricket club named The Wednesday Cricket Club after the day of the week on which they played their matches. The footballing side of the club was established to keep the team together and fit during the winter months.
The reason the games were played on a Wednesday was due to the team being formed by local butchers who had a half day finishing on a Wednesday.
The club was formerly known as &quot;The Wednesday Football Club&quot; until 1929, when the club was officially renamed &quot;Sheffield Wednesday Football Club&quot; under the stewardship of manager Robert Brown. The club is sometimes still referred to as simply 'The Wednesday'.18 However the name Sheffield Wednesday dates back as far as 1883: the former ground at Olive Grove had the name Sheffield Wednesday painted on the stand roof.
Wednesday's original nickname was &quot;The Blades&quot;, a common name for Sheffield clubs during the 19th century due to the city's links to the cutlery industry and now the nickname of their long-term local rivals Sheffield United. At the start of the 20th century, when a player presented them with an owl mascot to honour their stadium at Owlerton, adjacent to Hillsborough, the club became known as &quot;The Owls&quot;.
Colours
Since its founding the club has played their home games in blue and white shirts, traditionally in vertical stripes. However this has not always been the case and there have been variations upon the theme. A monochrome photograph from 1874&lt;U+2013&gt;75 shows the Wednesday team in plain dark shirts,19 while the 1871 &quot;Rules of the Sheffield Football Association&quot; listed the Wednesday club colours as blue and white hoops.20 A quartered blue and white design was used in 1887 and a blue shirt with white sleeves between 1965 and 1973.21 This design would have received greater notoriety had Wednesday not worn their away kit for all of their games in the 1966 FA Cup run, when all of their ties were drawn away. Given the option in the final of wearing their first strip, they chose the away strip for luck; but Everton managed to claw back a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0 deficit after 54 minutes and eventually won the game 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2.
There is a superstition among many older Wednesday fans that the team tends to have a poor season when they abandon the traditional evenly spaced blue and white stripe designs in favour of some broad stripe or narrow stripe design. However, in an age of marketing-driven decisions, the team only reverts to the familiar style every so often.
Wednesday have often favoured black shorts or, more recently, blue. There have been times where Wednesday have opted to play in white shorts, sometimes to minimise colour clashes with the opposing team. The socks were invariably blue and white hoops but these too have gone through changes including blue with a white roll over top, all blue and all white.
The away strip has changed regularly over the years although an all yellow strip has been used for many of the recent seasons in the club's history. Traditionally white was the second choice for many teams, including Wednesday. Other colours used for away kits in previous years include black, silver, green and orange. Wednesday have always avoided red as an alternative colour but for years had the players' numbers in red on the first-choice shirt backs, which was not easy to discern against blue and white stripes.
The shirt sponsors Lotto finish their contract at the end of the 2008-09 season and the new shirts are supplied by Puma with whom the club had a successful partnership in the Premier League. Home colours are the traditional shirt of blue and white stripes, coupled with black shorts and the away strip is yellow shirts with blue shorts.
Grounds
Since 1899 Wednesday have played their home games at Hillsborough Stadium in the Owlerton district of Sheffield. The stadium was originally named Owlerton Stadium but in 1914 Owlerton became part of the parliamentary constituency of Hillsborough and the ground took on its current name.22 With 39,812 seats, Hillsborough has the second highest capacity of stadiums in the Championship, after 's St James' Park, and the 12th highest in England. The club intends to increase Hillsborough's capacity to 44,825 by 2012 and 50,000 by 2016 and make several other improvements in the process.23
Originally, Wednesday played matches at Highfield, but moved several times before adopting a permanent ground. Other locations included Myrtle Road, Heeley and Hunter's Bar. Major matches were played at Sheaf House or Bramall Lane, before Sheffield United made it their home ground.24 Sheffield Wednesday's first permanent home ground was at Olive Grove, a site near Queen's Road originally leased from the Duke of Norfolk. The first game at Olive Grove was a 4&lt;U+2013&gt;4 draw with Blackburn Rovers on 12 September 1887. Extensions to the adjacent railway forced the club to move to their current ground in 1899.
The stadium has hosted FIFA World Cup football (1966), The 1996 European Championships (Euro 96) and 27 FA Cup Semi Finals. The Kop at Hillsborough was re-opened in 1986 by Queen Elizabeth II and was once the largest covered stand of any football stadium in Europe.25
The Hillsborough disaster occurred on 15 April 1989 at an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. 96 Liverpool fans were crushed to death after the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of the ground became overcrowded. The following report concluded that the root cause of the disaster was the failure of local police to adequately manage the crowds.2627 A memorial to the victims of the disaster stands outside Hillsborough's South Stand, near the main entrance on Parkside Road.
Support
 Wednesday have enjoyed good support despite their recent decline in fortunes. They had the highest average attendance during both seasons in Division Two/League One2829 and continued the trend when returning to the Championship with the highest attendances in that division.30 At the 2005 playoff final Wednesday took over 42,000 fans to the Millennium Stadium,31 which remains the highest number of supporters any football team has taken to the Millennium Stadium.
The Owls have many famous fans from the world of sport&amp; music including with former England Cricket Captain Michael Vaughan;32 Champion boxer Johnny Nelson;33 the Arctic Monkeys;34 Jarvis Cocker from Pulp;35 Martin Ware of Heaven 17 &amp; The Human League;36 Paul Carrack from Mike &amp; the Mechanics and Ace (who recorded &quot;Singing the Blues&quot; for The Owls); Rick Savage from Def Leppard;37 MPs Roy Hattersley &amp; David Blunkett; Coronation Street actor Tommy Craig.
One of their most famous fans is Paul Gregory. Known to many as &quot;Tango&quot; or &quot;Tango Man&quot; due to his similarity to a character appearing in advertisements for the eponymous soft drink in the 1990s, he takes his shirt off for every away match.38 He achieved national fame during the 1990s appearing on The Big Breakfast and The Sunday Show. Another famous Wednesday institution was the Wednesday Band, a brass band that played during matches. Although unpopular amongst many rival fans (and some home fans),39 they have released several records and have been invited to regularly attend England matches.40 They were often banned from away grounds and suffered the same fate at home until 22 March 2009, when the band returned to Hillsborough. The future of the band is unknown, their return was a success and now decisions have to be made at boardroom level to see if their position back on the Kop is long-term.
Supporters' groups include Wednesdayite, an independent football supporters' organisation which owns over 10% of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and The London Owls, an active supporters' club for Wednesday fans living in London and South East England.
Sheffield Wednesday have had a large variety of fanzines over the years; examples include Just Another Wednesday, Out of the Blue, Spitting Feathers, Boddle, A View From The East Bank, Cheat! and War of the Monster Trucks, which acquired its name from the programme that Yorkshire Television elected to show instead of the celebrations after the 1991 League Cup victory over Manchester United.41 More recently, an on-line fanzine has been set up by fan-site Owlsonline.
Below are recent average attendances at Hillsborough:
2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10: 23,179 (Football League Championship) second tier
2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09: 21,542 (Football League Championship) second tier
2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08: 21,410 (Football League Championship) second tier
2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07: 23,638 (Football League Championship) second tier
2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06: 24,853 (Football League Championship) second tier
2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05: 23,107 (Football League One) third tier
2003&lt;U+2013&gt;04: 22,336 (Division Two) third tier
Rivalry
Sheffield Wednesday's main rivals are city neighbours Sheffield United. Matches between these two clubs are nicknamed Steel City derbies, so called because of the steel industry the city of Sheffield is famous for. These matches are usually the highlight of the season for both sets of supporters and attract large attendances. Sheffield Wednesday's other rivals include Barnsley, Rotherham, Doncaster and Leeds United.
Famous Steel City derbies include:
The Boxing Day Massacre; a Football League Third Division match which took place at Hillsborough on 26 December 1979. To date, it is the only season (1979/1980) the two clubs have played each other outside of the top two divisions. A record Third Division crowd of 49,309 supporters watched Wednesday beat United 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0, therefore becoming part of Sheffield Wednesday folklore.
The Semi-Final Match; an FA Cup Semi-Final match which took place at Wembley on 3 April 1993. The match was scheduled to take place at Elland Road but due to the sheer number of supporters wanting to see the match the Football Association decided to switch venue to Wembley. A crowd of 75,365 supporters made the trip down to London to watch Wednesday beat United 2-1 after extra time in a fiercely contested game. Wednesday went on to lose against Arsenal in the final.
Sheffield United have the better record in Steel City Derby matches, having won 44 times compared to Wednesday's 41 victories. Of the most recent ten encounters, Wednesday have won 4 matches, whilst United have won 3. On 7 February 2009, Wednesday beat United 2-1 at Bramall Lane. This, on the back of a 1-0 victory for Wednesday at Hillsborough earlier in the season, gave Wednesday their first double over United since the 1913/1914 season, a 92 year wait.
Crest and mascots
   Since their move to Owlerton, the owl has become a theme that has run throughout the club. The original club crest was introduced in 195642 and consisted of a shield showing a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch. The White Rose of York43 was depicted below the branch alluding to the home county of Yorkshire and the sheaves of Sheffield (Sheaf field) were shown at either side of the owl's head. The club's Latin motto, Consilio et Animis, was displayed beneath the shield.44 This translates into English as &quot;By Wisdom and Courage&quot;.45
The crest was changed in 1970 to a minimalist version that shows a stylised owl with a large round head and eyes perched on the letters S.W.F.C. Various different colours were used on this badge, regularly changing with the kit design. The predominant colours however were black and yellow. This version remained in use throughout the 1970s and 1980s before being replaced in 1995.46
The new crest reverted to a similar design to the original crest. It again featured a traditionally drawn owl perched on a branch although the design of both had changed. The sheaves were replaced by a stylised SWFC logo that had been in use on club merchandise for several years prior to the introduction of the new crest. The Yorkshire Rose was moved to above the owl's head to make way for the words Sheffield Wednesday. The word Hillsborough was also curved around the top of the design. The club motto was absent on the new design. The crest was encased in a new shape of shield. This crest remained in use for only a few years, during which several versions were used with different colouration including a white crest with blue stripes down either side and the colouring of the detail inverted. Most recently the shield shape has remained but the detailed owl logo has been replaced, yet again, by the minimalist version, echoing the badge's course of history in the 1970s. The most recent change was the addition of a copyright symbol in 2002.47
Over the years Sheffield Wednesday have had several Owl themed matchday mascots. Originally it was Ozzie The Owl and later two further Owls, Baz &amp; Ollie were added. All three were replaced in 2006 by Barney Owl, a similar looking owl but with more defined eyes to make it look cuter. Ozzie Owl was reintroduced as Wednesday's main mascot during the home game with Charlton Athletic on 17 January 2009.

Dickinson, who was in charge for 29 years, is Wednesday's longest-serving manager, and helped establish the club among the finest in the country during the first two decades of the 20th century.
Brown succeeded Dickinson and remained in charge for 13 years; in 1930 he secured their most recent top division league title to date.
Taylor took over during the Second World War and remained in charge until 1958, but failed to win a major trophy, even though Wednesday were in the top flight for most of his reign.
Charlton took Wednesday out of the Third Division in 1980 and in his final season (1982&lt;U+2013&gt;83) he took them to the semi-finals of the FA Cup.
Wilkinson succeeded Charlton in the summer of 1983 and was in charge for more than five years before he moved to Leeds United. His first season saw Wednesday gain promotion to the First Division after a 14-year exile. He guided them to a fifth place finish in 1986, but Wednesday were unable to compete in the 1986&lt;U+2013&gt;87 UEFA Cup due to the ban on English teams in European competitions due to the Heysel Disaster of 1985.
Francis took over as player-manager in June 1991 after Ron Atkinson (who had just guided them to Football League Cup glory and promotion to the First Division) departed to Aston Villa. He guided them to third place in the league in 1992, and earned them a UEFA Cup place. They finished seventh in the inaugural Premier League and were runners-up of the FA Cup and League Cup that year. He was sacked in 1995 after Wednesday finished 13th &lt;U+2013&gt; their lowest standing in four years since winning promotion.

Historical league position (the four bars represent the four tiers of the Football League)
Wednesday's biggest recorded win was a 13-0 victory over Halliwell in the first round of the FA Cup on 18 January 1891. The biggest league win was against Birmingham City in Division 1 on 13 December 1930; Wednesday won 9-1. Both of these wins occurred at home.
The heaviest defeat was away from home against Aston Villa in a Division 1 match on 5 October 1912 which Wednesday lost 10-0.
The most goals scored by the club in a season was the 106 scored in the 1958&lt;U+2013&gt;59 season. The club also accumulated their highest league points total in the same season when they racked up 88 points.
The highest home attendance was in the FA Cup fifth round on 17 February 1934. A total of 72,841 turned up to see a 2-2 draw with Manchester City. Unfortunately for Wednesday, they went on to lose the replay 2-0. (Manchester City won the FA Cup that season)
The most capped Englishman to play for the club was goalkeeper Ron Springett who won 33 caps while at Sheffield Wednesday. Springett also held the overall record for most capped Sheffield Wednesday player until Nigel Worthington broke the record, eventually gaining a total of 50 caps for Northern Ireland whilst at the club.
The fastest sending off in British League football is held by Sheffield Wednesday keeper Kevin Pressman - who was sent off after just 13 seconds for handling a shot from Wolverhampton's Temuri Ketsbaia outside the area during the opening weekend of 2000.49
The fastest shot ever recorded in the Premier League was hit by David Hirst against Arsenal at Highbury in September 1996 - Hirst hit the bar with a shot clocked at 114 mph.
