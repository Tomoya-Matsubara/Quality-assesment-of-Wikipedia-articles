It was presented by Microsoft's Xbox and took place on November 14, 2004 at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio and starred talent from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands.
The main match on the Raw brand was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match, a type of elimination match, between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista, and Snitsky), which Team Orton won after Orton last eliminated Triple H.1 The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) versus Booker T for the WWE Championship, which JBL won by pinfall after hitting Booker with the title belt.2 The primary match on the undercard was a 4 on 4 Survivor Series match between Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) and Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Carlito, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak), which Team Guerrero won after Big Show last eliminated Angle.3
Several of the existing feuds carried on following the event. Triple H continued feuding with Randy Orton, and at New Year's Revolution in January, Triple H last eliminated Orton in an Elimination Chamber match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship.4 John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield also continued his feud with Booker T, defeating him, Eddie Guerrero, and The Undertaker at Armageddon.5 Following the event, Carlito sustained a legitimate injury and lost the WWE United States Championship to John Cena, with whom he was in a storyline.6
Background
The event featured seven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWE script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned storylines that took place before, during and after the event. All wrestlers were from one of the WWE's brands &lt;U+2013&gt; SmackDown and Raw &lt;U+2013&gt; the two storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees.
 The main feud on the Raw brand was between Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) and Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky). On the October 25, 2004 episode of Raw, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) were put in charge of Raw, after General Manager Eric Bischoff took the night off. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch with Orton,78 as he lost a Steel Cage match to Orton at Taboo Tuesday.9 Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series.1011 Orton, however, lost the match after interference by Triple H, giving the win to Flair, so Orton did not receive an opportunity for the World Heavyweight title.1213 On the November 1 episode of Raw, General Manager Eric Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match between Orton, Jericho, Maven and Benoit and Triple H, Batista, Edge and Snistky at Survivor Series.

At ringside, a fight broke out between Triple H and Orton's team, which caused the match to end in a No Contest.1819
 The predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) versus Booker T, with the two battling over JBL's WWE Championship. On the October 21, 2004 episode of SmackDown!, SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long booked a six man tag team match involving Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL, Kenzo Suzuki, and Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Dupr&lt;U+00E9&gt;e. At the time, Booker T was a heel and congratulated JBL's success with the company in a segment backstage.2021 The tag team match got underway, and JBL was led to believe that Booker T was going to betray Van Dam and Mysterio, as Booker T warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match. The match concluded with Booker T pinning JBL after an axe kick, thus turning Booker face.2223 The following week on SmackDown!, Booker T defeated Orlando Jordan to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series.24 On the November 4 episode of SmackDown!, JBL interfered in a match between Booker T and Orlando Jordan, which ended in a disqualification, giving Booker T the win.2526 After the disqualification by JBL, Theodore Long scheduled a tag team match between Booker T and Josh Mathews versus JBL and Orlando Jordan.

Aftermath
 As Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Maven) defeated Team Triple H (Triple H, Edge, Batista and Snitsky) at Survivor Series, they were given the opportunity to be in charge of Raw for a month; On the November 29 episode of Raw, Randy Orton was in charge and scheduled a World Heavyweight title Battle Royal. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, however, overruled the Battle Royal match and instead booked Triple H to face the winner of the Battle Royal.5152 The battle royal match saw Chris Benoit and Edge, as the final two participants, going over the top rope at the same time, ostensibly ending the match.5354 Orton, acting as General Manager, booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Edge, and Triple H for the World Heavyweight title. The match resulted in Benoit applying the Crossface on Edge, only for Edge to manage to roll Benoit over, while the Crossface was still locked in, causing Benoit&lt;U+2019&gt;s shoulders to touch the mat.
