 This is a list of acquisitions by Electronic Arts. Electronic Arts is a company that is an American developer, marketer, publisher, and distributor of computer and video games, that was founded in 1982. Products of the company include EA Sports franchises, Sims, and other titles on both handheld and home gaming consoles.1
Electronic Arts often acquires new companies to expand or add to new product lines. For instance, EA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Probst said after the acquisition of JAMDAT Mobile that &quot;we intend to build a leading global position in the [...] business of providing games on mobile phones&quot;.2 EA followed through with this later, making the company into EA Mobile, and allowing people to purchase and download content produced by them directly onto their phones.3 After the acquisition of Origin Systems, some staff in that company claimed that Electronic Arts initially gave them more resources, but allowed little lattitude if employees made a mistake, and in some cases no longer trusted them, and even worked against them.45 EA has shut down studios of companies after acquiring them, including DICE Canada and Origin Systems.67 Gaming blogger Brian Crecente has said that fears that EA doesn't care about the quality of their products after they are acquired are debatable.8
As of April 2008, Electronic Arts' largest acquisition is the purchase of VG Holding Corp., the owner of video game developers Bioware and Pandemic Studios, for $775 million. Of the 26 companies acquired by EA, 15 are based in the U.S., three in the United Kingdom, five in Continental Europe, and three elsewhere.
Each acquisition listed is for the entire company. The acquisition date listed is the date of the agreement between Electronic Arts (EA) and the subject of the acquisition. The value of each acquisition is listed in U.S. dollars, because EA is headquartered in the U.S. If the value of the acquisition is not listed, then it is undisclosed. If the EA service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed. __TOC__
