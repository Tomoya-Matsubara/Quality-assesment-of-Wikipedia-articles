Ryj Lang-ja  prancing dragon was a light aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy IJN during the early 1930s. Small and lightly built in an attempt to exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, she proved to be top-heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the shipyard for modifications to address those issues within a year of completion. With her stability improved, Ryj returned to service and was employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II, she provided air support for operations in Philippines Campaign 19411942 the Philippines, Malayan Campaign Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies Campaign Dutch East Indies, where her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea. During the Indian Ocean raid in April 1942, the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with both her guns and her aircraft. Ryj next participated in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands in June. She was sunk by American carrier aircraft at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942.
Design
Ryj was planned as a light carrier of around convert 8000 t LT sp=us Displacement ship#Standard displacement standard displacement to exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 that carriers under convert 10000 LT t standard displacement were not regarded as aircraft carriers.See: s:Washington_Naval_Treaty,_1922#AIRCRAFT_CARRIER Washington Naval Treaty, Chapter II, Part 4, Definitions While Ryj was under construction, Article Three of the London Naval Treaty of 1930 closed the above-mentioned loophole; consequently, Ryj was the only light aircraft carrier of her type to be completed by Japan.cite web url=http://www.microworks.net/pacific/road_to_war/london_treaty.htm title=International Treaty for the Limitation and Reduction of Naval Armament year=1930 accessdate=21 June 2013; See Part 1, Article 3, Paragraph 1.
Ryj had a length of convert 179.9 m ftin sp=us length overall overall.Chesneau, p. 163 She had a beam nautical beam of convert 20.32 m ftin sp=us and a draft ship draft of convert 5.56 m ftin sp=us. She displacement ship displaced convert 8000 t LT sp=us at standard load and convert 10150 t LT sp=us at normal load. Her crew consisted of 600 officers and enlisted men.Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 45
File:Japanese aircraft carrier Ryj Front.jpg thumb left Bow view of Ryj, 1933
To keep Ryj's weight to 8,000 metric tons, her hull was lightly built and no armor could be provided, although some protective plating was added abreast the machinery spaces and magazine artillery magazines. She was also designed with only a single hangar, which would have left her with an extremely low profile there being just convert 4.6 m ftin sp=us of freeboard nautical freeboard amidships and convert 3.0 m ftin sp=us aft. Between the time the carrier was laid down in 1929 and launched in 1931, however, the Navy doubled her aircraft stowage requirement to 48 in order to give her a more capable air group. This necessitated the addition of a second hangar atop the first, raising freeboard to convert 14.9 m ftin sp=us. Coupled with the ship's narrow beam, the consequent top-heaviness made her minimally stable in rough seas, despite the fitting of Sperry Corporation Sperry active stabilizer ship stabilizers. This was a common flaw amongst many treaty-circumventing Japanese warships of her generation.Brown 1977, p. 17
The Tomozuru Incident of 12 March 1934, in which a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the IJN to investigate the stability of all their ships, resulting in a number of design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength. Ryj, already known to be only marginally stable, was promptly docked at the Kure Naval Arsenal for modifications that strengthened her keel and added ballast and shallow torpedo bulges to improve her stability. Her funnel ship funnels were moved higher up the side of her hull and curved downward to keep the deck clear of smoke.Parshall, Tully & Casse
Shortly afterward, Ryj was one of many Japanese warships caught in a typhoon on 25 September 1935 while on maneuvers during the 4th Fleet Imperial Japanese Navy#The Fourth Fleet Incident Fourth Fleet Incident. The ship's bridge nautical bridge, flight deck and superstructure were damaged and her hangar was flooded. Her forecastle was raised one deck and her bow was remodeled with more flare ship flare to make her less wet forward. After these modifications, her beam and draft increased to convert 20.78 m ftin sp=us and convert 7.08 m ftin sp=us respectively. Her displacement also increased to convert 10600 t LT sp=us at standard load and convert 12732 t LT sp=us at normal load. Her crew also grew to 924 officers and enlisted men.
Machinery
The ship was fitted with two geared steam turbine sets with a total of convert 65000 shp kW lk=in, each driving one propeller shaft ship propeller shaft, using steam provided by six Kampon water-tube boilers. Ryj had a designed speed of convert 29 kn lk=in, but reached convert 29.5 kn during her sea trials from convert 65270 shp abbr=on. The ship carried convert 2490 LT t of fuel oil, which gave her a range of convert 10000 nmi lk=in at convert 14 kn. The boiler uptakes were trunked to the ship's starboard side amidships and exhausted horizontally below flight deck level through two small funnels.Brown 1977, p. 18
Flight Deck & Hangars
Ryj was a flush deck flush-decked carrier without an Glossary of nautical terms#I island superstructure; her navigating and control bridge was located just under the forward lip of the flight deck in a long glassed-in greenhouse. Her superstructure was set back convert 23.5 m ftin sp=us from the ship's stem ship stem, giving Ryj a distinctive open bow. Her convert 156.5 m ftin sp=us adj=on flight deck was convert 23 m ftin sp=us wide and extended well beyond the aft end of her superstructure, supported by a pair of pillars. Six transverse arrestor wires were installed on the flight deck and were later modernized in 1936 to stop a convert 6000 kg lb abbr=on aircraft. The ship's hangars were both convert 102.4 m ftin sp=us long and convert 18.9 m ftin sp=us wide, and had an approximate area of convert 3871 sqm 0.Peattie, p. 235 Between them, they gave the ship the capacity to store 48 aircraft, although only 37 could be operated at one time. After the Fourth Fleet Incident, Ryj's bridge and the leading edge of the flight deck were rounded off to make them more streamlined. This reduced the length of the flight deck by convert 2 m ftin sp=us.
Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two Elevator#Aircraft_elevators elevators; the forward platform measured convert 15.7 x 11.1 m ft 1 sp=us and the rear convert 10.8 x 8.0 m ft 1 sp=us. The small rear elevator became a problem as the IJN progressively fielded larger and more modern carrier aircraft. Of all the aircraft in front-line service in 1941, only the Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bomber would fit, when positioned at an angle with its wings folded. This effectively made Ryj a single-elevator carrier and considerably hindered transfer of aircraft in and out of the hangars for rearming and refueling during combat operations.
Armament
As completed, Ryj's primary anti-aircraft gun anti-aircraft AA armament comprised six twin-gun mounts equipped with 40-caliber artillery caliber 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval gun 12.7-centimeter Type 89 dual-purpose guns mounted on projecting sponsons, three on either side of the carrier's hull. When firing at surface targets, the guns had a range of convert 14700 m yd sp=us; they had a maximum ceiling of convert 9440 m ft sp=us at their maximum elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute.Campbell, pp. 19293 Twenty-four anti-aircraft AA Type 93 13.2 mm Hotchkiss machine guns were also fitted, in twin and quadruple mounts. Their effective range against aircraft was convert 700 - 1500 m yd sp=us. The cyclic rate was adjustable between 425 and 475 rounds per minute, but the need to change 30-round magazine firearms magazines reduced the effective rate to 250 rounds per minute.Campbell, p. 202
During the carrier's 193436 refit, two of the convert 12.7 cm sp=us adj=on mountings were exchanged for two twin-gun mounts for license-built 25 mm Hotchkiss anti-aircraft gun Hotchkiss Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun 25&nbsp;mm Type 96 light AA guns, resulting in a savings of approximately convert 60 LT t abbr=on of top-weight that improved the ship's overall stability. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the weapon had many faults including an inability to handle high-speed targets because it could not be trained or elevated fast enough by either hand or power, its sights were inadequate for high-speed targets, and it possessed excessive vibration and muzzle blast.Stille, p. 51 These convert 25 mm in adj=on sp=us guns had an effective range of convert 1500 - 3000 m yd sp=us, and an effective ceiling of convert 5500 m ft sp=us at an elevation of +85 degrees. The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen-round magazines.Campbell, p. 200 The machine-guns were replaced during a brief refit in AprilMay 1942 with six triple-mount convert 25 mm sp=us adj=on AA guns.
Construction and service

Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions for aircraft carriers, Ryj was named Prancing Dragon.Silverstone, p. 335 The ship was Keel laid down at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Mitsubishi's Yokohama shipyard on 26 November 1929. She was Ship naming and launching launched on 2 April 1931, towed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 25 April for fitting out, and Ship commissioning commissioned on 9 May 1933 with Captain Toshio Matsunaga in command. While training in mid-1933, her initial air group consisted of nine Mitsubishi B1M2 Type 13 torpedo bombers, plus three spares, and three Nakajima A1N A1N1 Type 3 fighter plane fighters, plus two spares. Matsunaga was relieved by Captain Torao Kuwabara on 20 October. After the Tomozuru Incident, the ship was reconstructed from 26 May to 20 August 1934.Tully & Casse
Captain Ichiro Ono assumed command on 15 November 1934 and Ryj became the flagship of Rear Admiral Hideho Wada's Carrier Division 1. The following month the ship was chosen to evaluate dive bomber dive-bombing tactics using six Nakajima E4N2-C Type 90 reconnaissance aircraft, six Yokosuka B3Y1 Type 92 torpedo bombers, and a dozen Nakajima A2N A2N1 Type 90 fighters. The reconnaissance aircraft proved to be unsuitable after several months' testing. Ryj participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 where she was attached to the IJN Fourth Fleet. The fleet was caught in a typhoon on 25 September and the ship was moderately damaged. Ryj arrived at Kure on 11 October 1935 for repairs, modifications, and a refit that lasted until 31 May 1936. On 31 October Ono was relieved by Captain Shun'ichi Kira.
In mid-1936, the ship was used to evaluate a dozen Aichi D1A dive bombers and dive-bombing tactics. She also embarked at that time 24 Nakajima A4N A4N1 fighters, plus four and eight spare aircraft respectively. In September, Ryj resumed her role as flagship of Carrier Division 1, now commanded by Rear Admiral Sabur Sat. Her air group now consisted of a mixture of B3Y1 torpedo bombers, D1A1 dive bombers and A2N fighters, but her torpedo bombers were transferred after fleet maneuvers in October demonstrated effective dive bombing tactics. Captain Katsuo Abe assumed command of the ship on 16 November.
Carrier Division 1 arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 to support operations of the Japanese Army in Republic of China 1912-1949 China. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters plus four spares and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai. The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 Nationalist Chinese Air Force Nationalist Curtiss Hawk III fighters and claimed to have shot down six without loss. The following day, four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves.Hata, Izawa & Shores, p. 144 The carriers returned to Sasebo, Nagasaki Sasebo at the beginning of September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near Guangzhou Canton. Nine fighters from Ryj escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that same day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down. The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and Nanking. Ryj returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral Tomoshige Samejima's Carrier Division 2.
In February 1938 the ship replaced her A4N biplanes with nine Mitsubishi A5M Claude monoplane fighters. The division supported Japanese operations in Southern China in MarchApril and again in October. Captain Kiichi Hasegawa assumed command on 15 November 1939. Ryj was given a refit that lasted from December 1939 through January 1940 and became a training ship until November when she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta's Carrier Division 3. Hasegawa was relieved by Captain Ushie Sugimoto on 21 June. The ship's air group then consisted of 18 Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and 16 A5M4 fighters. When the First Air Fleet was formed on 10 April 1941, Ryj became flagship of Carrier Division 4.
World War II

The ship's assignment at the beginning of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines, initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao, Mindanao on the morning of 8 December.Japan Standard Time is 19 hours ahead of Hawaiian Standard Time, so in Japan, the attack on Pearl Harbor happened on 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each type of aircraft were spares. Ryj's initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes on the ground for the loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao.Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. I, pp. 164, 19192 In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula.
In mid-February 1942, Ryj's aircraft attacked ships evacuating from Singapore, claiming eight ships damaged, three burnt, and four sunk. They also covered convoys carrying troops to Sumatra. The ship was unsuccessfully attacked by several Bristol Blenheim light bombers of No. 84 Squadron RAF on 14 February. The following day two waves of B5Ns, totalling 13 aircraft, attacked the British heavy cruiser HMS Exeter 68 2, but only managed to damage the ship's Supermarine Walrus seaplane. Follow-on attacks later that day were also unsuccessful. Two days later, B5Ns destroyed HNLMS Van Ghent 1926 6, a Dutch destroyer that had run aground in the Gaspar Strait and been abandoned on 14 February.Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. II, pp. 88, 90, 93, 109, 12324, 199 The carrier sailed to Saigon, French Indochina the next day and arrived on 20 February. A week later she was assigned to cover the convoy taking troops to Jakarta, Java. Her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea on 1 March and six B5Ns sank the American destroyer USS Pope DD-225 2 after it had been abandoned by its crew.Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. II, p. 306 Six other B5Ns bombed the port of Semarang, possibly setting one merchantman on fire.
Ryj arrived in Singapore on 5 March and the ship supported operations in Sumatra and escorted convoys to Burma and the Andaman Islands for the rest of the month. On 1 April, while the 1st Air Fleet was starting Indian Ocean raid its raid in the Indian Ocean, Malay Force, consisting of Ryj, six cruisers, and four destroyers, left Burma on a mission to destroy merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal. B5Ns damaged one freighter on 5 April before the force split into three groups. Ryj's aircraft bombed the small ports of Cocanada and Vizagapatam on the southeastern coast of India the next day, doing little damage, in addition to claiming two ships sunk and six more damaged during the day. The carrier and her escorts, the light cruiser ship Japanese cruiser Yura  2 and the destroyer ship Japanese destroyer Yugiri  2 claimed to have sunk three more ships by gunfire. All together, Malay Force sank 19 ships totalling almost GRT 100,000 first=yes,Shores, Cull & Izawa, Vol. II, pp. 393, 40811 before reuniting on 7 April and arriving at Singapore on 11 April. A week later, her B5Ns were detached for torpedo training and the ship arrived at Kure on 23 April for a brief refit.
The newly commissioned carrier ship Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y  2 joined Carrier Division 4, under the command of Kakuta, with Ryj on 3 May 1942. They formed the core of the 2nd Carrier Strike Force, part of the Northern Force, tasked to attack the Aleutian Islands, an operation planned to seize several of the islands to provide advance warning in case of an American attack from the Aleutians down the Kurile Islands while the main body of the American fleet was occupied Battle of Midway defending Midway. Ryj's air group now consisted of 12 A6M2 Zeros and 18 B5Ns,Parshall & Tully, pp. 4346, 459 plus two spares of each type. The ship transferred to Mutsu Bay on 25 May and then to Paramushiro on 1 June before departing the same day for the Aleutians.
At dawn on 3 June, she launched nine B5Ns, escorted by six Zeros, to attack Battle of Dutch Harbor Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. One B5N crashed on takeoff and only six of the B5Ns and all of the Zeros were able to make it through the bad weather, destroying two PBYs and inflicting significant damage on the oil depot oil storage tanks and barracks. A second airstrike was launched later in the day to attack a group of destroyers discovered by aircraft from the first attack, but they failed to find the targets. One Zero from Ryj from the second strike was damaged by a Curtiss P-40 and crash landed on the island of Akutan. The aircraft, later dubbed the Akutan Zero, remained largely intact and was later salvaged and test-flown. Another airstrike was launched on the following day by the two carriers that consisted of 15 Zeros, 11 D3As, and 6 B5Ns and successfully bombed Dutch Harbor. Shortly after the aircraft were launched, the Americans attacked the carriers, but failed to inflict any damage. A Martin B-26 Marauder bomber and a PBY were shot down by Zeros, and a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber was shot down by flak during the attack.Brown 2009, pp. 14748
Ryj arrived back at Mutsu Bay on 24 June, but departed for the Aleutians four days later to cover the second reinforcement convoy to Attu Island Attu and Kiska Islands and remained in the area until 7 July in case of an American counterattack. She arrived at Kure on 13 July for a refit and was transferred to Carrier Division 2 a day later.

The destroyer Amatsukaze lower left is moving away from Ryujo at full speed and the destroyer Tokitsukaze faintly visible, upper right is backing away from the bow of Ryujo in order to evade the B-17s' falling bombs.
The Guadalcanal Campaign American landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi on 7 August caught the Japanese by surprise. The next day, Ryj was transferred to Carrier Division 1 and departed for Chuuk Lagoon Truk on 16 August together with the other two carriers of the division, ship Japanese aircraft carrier Shkaku  2 and ship Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku  2. Her air group consisted of 24 Zeros and nine B5N2s.Lundstrom, pp. 9294 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, ordered Truk to be bypassed and the fleet refuelled at sea after an American carrier was spotted near the Solomon Islands on 21 August.Brown 2009, p. 169 At 01:45 on 24 August, Vice Admiral Chichi Nagumo, commander of the Mobile Force, ordered Ryj and the heavy cruiser ship Japanese cruiser Tone 1937 2, escorted by two destroyers, detached to move in advance of the troop convoy bound for Guadalcanal and to attack the Allied air base at Honiara International Airport Henderson Field if no carriers were spotted. This Detached Force was commanded by Rear Admiral Chichi Hara in Tone.Lundstrom, p. 109
Ryj launched two small airstrikes, totalling six B5Ns and 15 Zeros, beginning at 12:20 once the Diversionary Force was convert 200 nmi north of Lunga Point. Four Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters from United States Marine Marine Fighter Squadron VMF-223 on combat air patrol CAP near Henderson Field spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft around 14:20 and alerted the defenders. Ten more Wildcats from VMF-223 and VMF-212 Scrambling military scrambled, as well as two United States Army Air Corps Bell P-400s from the 67th Fighter Squadron in response. Nine of the Zeros strafed the airfield while the B5Ns bombed it with convert 60 kg adj=on sp=us bombs to little effect. The Americans claimed to have shot down 19 aircraft, but only three Zeros and three B5Ns were lost, although another B5N was forced to crash-land. Only three Wildcats were shot down in turn.Lundstrom, pp. 11619
Around 14:40, the Detached Force was spotted again by several search aircraft from the carrier USS Enterprise CV-6 6, although the Japanese ships did not immediately spot the Americans. They launched three Zeros as CAP at 14:55, shortly before two of the searching Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers near-missed Ryj convert 150 m sp=us astern with four convert 500 lb adj=on bombs three minutes later. Two more Zeros reinforced the CAP shortly after 15:00, just in time to intercept two more searching Avengers, shooting down one. In the meantime, the carrier USS Saratoga CV-3 6 had launched an airstrike against the Detached Force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses and eight Avengers; the long range precluded fighter escort. They sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked. They hit Ryj three times with convert 1000 lb kg adj=on bombs and one torpedo; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms. No aircraft from either Ryj or Saratoga were shot down in the attack.Lundstrom, pp. 116, 11922
The bomb hits set the carrier on fire and she took on a list watercraft list from the flooding caused by the torpedo hit. Ryj turned north at 14:08, but her list continued to increase although the fires were put out. The progressive flooding disabled her machinery and caused her to stop at 14:20. The order to abandon ship was given at 15:15 and the destroyer ship Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze  2 moved alongside to rescue the crew. The ships were bombed several times by multiple B-17s without effect before Ryj capsized about 17:55 at coordinates Coord 06 10 S 160 50 E display=inline,title with the loss of 7 officers and 113 crewmen.
