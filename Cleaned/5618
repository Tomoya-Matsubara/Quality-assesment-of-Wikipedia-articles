Lisa del Giocondo (June 15 1479 – July 15 1542 or c. 1551), born and also known as Lisa Gherardini, Lisa di Antonio Maria (Antonmaria) Gherardini and Elisabetta Gherardini, also known as Lisa del Gioconda, was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany in Italy. Her name, Mona Lisa, was given to her portrait which was commissioned by her husband and painted by Leonardo da Vinci during the Italian Renaissance.
Little is known about Lisa's life. Married as a teenager, she was mother to five children and led what is thought to have been a comfortable and ordinary middle-class life. Lisa outlived her husband who became a local elected official and who was about twenty years her senior.
Hundreds of years after her death, her portrait took on a life separate from Lisa, the woman. For much of the 20th century, popular and scholarly speculation made Mona Lisa an icon, an object of ridicule and commercialization1 and the &quot;world's most famous painting&quot;.2 A researcher's discovery during the early 21st century was powerful enough evidence to end speculation about the sitter's identity, and finally reunited Lisa's portrait with her person.3
Life and family
 Lisa was the daughter of Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini and Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de Carducci who married in 1466. The family had income from nearby farmland and lived in Florence near Santa Trinita and also had a small country home about  south of the city, in St. Donato in the village of Poggio. When their city home was damaged the family moved to rented space near Santo Spirito.4
On March 5 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo (1460&lt;U+2013&gt;1528 or c. 15395), a modestly successful cloth and silk merchant, becoming his third wife at the age of fifteen. Camilla di Mariotto Rucellai, whom he married in 1491, and Tommasa di Mariotto Villani, whom he married in 1493, both may have died in childbirth. Lisa's dowry was land near her family's country home and 170 florins, a sign the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and one reason to think she and her husband may have loved each other. The couple lived a middle-class life, neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status somewhat because her husband's family was better off financially.6 Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an &quot;old name&quot;.7
 They had five children, Piero, Camilla, Andrea, Giocondo and Marietta, four of them between 1496 and 1507.8 One of their daughters died in 1499 and is buried in the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella.9 Lisa's stepmother Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai and Francesco's first wife were sisters.10
Francesco was elected in 1499 to the Dodici Buonomini and may have had some ties to Medici family political or business interests.11 The family shared accommodation until March 5 1503 when Francesco bought a house in the Via della Stufa and they had their own household. Leonardo is thought to have started to paint Lisa's portrait the same year.12 In 1512 during fears the Medici would return from exile, Francesco was imprisoned, fined 1,000 florins, and released in September when the Medici returned to Florence. That year he was elected to the Signoria13 and in 1524 he was confirmed as a Priori.14
By one account by an amateur scholar, Francesco died in the plague of 1528. Lisa fell ill and her daughter Marietta, a nun, brought her to the convent of Sant'Orsola where she died about four years later at the age of 63.1516 In a scholarly account of their lives, Francesco lived to be 80 years old. He died in 1539 and Lisa may have lived until at least 1551 and reached age 71 or 72.17
Mona Lisa
 Like other Florentines of their financial means, Francesco's family were art lovers and patrons&lt;U+2014&gt;the family's burial site in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze gained a painting through the efforts of his son Bartolommeo, and Andrea del Sarto painted a Madonna for another member of his family.18 When he commissioned Leonardo with Mona Lisa and later Domenico Puligo with a painting of Saint Francis, Francesco was a patron like his peers. Mona Lisa was painted beginning in 1503, following Andrea's birth and when the family was celebrating owning its own home.19 Lisa was 24 years old when Leonardo started her portrait.
The painting fulfilled 15th and early-16th century requirements for portraying a woman of virtue and also succeeded in presenting Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Lisa is painted as a faithful wife, not with a wedding ring, but through gesture&lt;U+2014&gt;her right hand rests over her left hand. Her dark garments and black veil do not depict mourning for her first daughter as some scholars have proposed, but rather, high fashion, in a style she and her contemporaries drew from Spanish influence. Equal in size to commissions paid for by wealthier art patrons of the time, the portrait is strikingly large and shows some social aspiration on the part of Francesco and Lisa.20
 Leonardo had no income that spring, which may in part explain his interest in a private commission,2122 but shortly after he began to paint Lisa's portrait, he received payment for starting the The Battle of Anghiari which was a more valuable commission, and one he was contracted to complete by February 1505.23 In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished.24 He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client.25 The artist's paintings traveled with him and he may have completed Mona Lisa years later in France26 in one estimation by 1516.27
Mona Lisa was first identified as Lisa in 1503.28 The painting's title dates to 1550 when Giorgio Vasari, an acquaintance of at least some of Francesco's family,29 wrote, &quot;Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife&quot;30 ().31 The portrait's Italian (La Gioconda) and French (La Joconde) titles are Lisa's married name as well as nickname32&lt;U+2014&gt;in English, &quot;jocund&quot; or the &quot;the happy one&quot;.
Through the heirs33 of Leonardo's assistant Salai most likely, Francis I purchased the Mona Lisa for 4,000 gold crowns to add it to the art collection at Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau de Fontainebleau.34 The people of France have owned it since the French Revolution.35 Speculation assigned Lisa's name to at least four different paintings36 and her identity to at least ten different people.37 By the 20th century, the painting, not Lisa, was a global icon. In 2005, a researcher discovered a margin note in the collection of the library of the University of Heidelberg, establishing with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa.38 Today part of a national collection, Mona Lisa hangs in the Louvre in Paris, titled Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo.3940
