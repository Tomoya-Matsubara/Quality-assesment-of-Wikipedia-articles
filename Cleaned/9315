Janusz (John) Antoni Brzozowski (born on May 10, 1935 in Warsaw, Poland) is a Polish-Canadian computer scientist.
In 1962, Brzozowski earned his PhD in the field of electrical engineering at Princeton University under Edward J. McCluskey. The topic of the thesis was Regular Expression Techniques for Sequential Circuits. From 1967 to 1996 he was Professor at the University of Waterloo. He is best known for his influential contributions to mathematical logic, circuit theory and automata theory.
Achievements in research
Brzozowski is renowned in particular for his fundamental work on regular expressions and on syntactic semigroups of formal languages.1 A notable achievement was the algebraic characterization of locally testable events together with Imre Simon, which had a similar impact2 on the development of the algebraic theory of formal languages as Sch&lt;U+00FC&gt;tzenberger's famous characterization of the star-free languages.
In the area, there are today at least three concepts bearing Brzozowski's name in honour of his contributions: The first is the Brzozowski conjecture3 about the regularity of noncounting classes. Second, Brzozowski's algorithm 4 is a conceptually simple algorithm for performing DFA minimization. Third, Eilenberg's reference work on automata theory has a chapter devoted to the so-called Brzozowski hierarchy5 inside the star-free languages, also known as dot-depth hierarchy. Curiously, Brzozowski was not only co-author of the paper6 that defined the dot-depth hierarchy and raised the question whether this hierarchy is strict, he later also was co-author of the paper7 resolving that problem after roughly ten years. The Brzozowski hierarchy gained further importance after Thomas discovered a relation between the algebraic concept of dot-depth and the alternation depth of quantifiers in first-order logic via Ehrenfeucht-Fra&lt;U+00EF&gt;ss&lt;U+00E9&gt; games.8
