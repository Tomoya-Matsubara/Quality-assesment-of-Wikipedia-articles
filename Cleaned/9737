Jan &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka z Trocnova a Kalicha ( or Johann Schischka; ) (c. 1360â€“1424), Czech general and Hussite leader, follower of Jan Hus, was born in the small village of Trocnov (now part of Borovany) in Bohemia, into a gentried family. He was nicknamed &quot;One-eyed &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka.&quot; Since his youth, he was attached to the royal court and held the office of Chamberlain to Queen Sophia.
He fought in the Battle of Grunwald (July 15, 1410), where he defended Radzy&lt;U+0144&gt; against the Teutonic Order. Later he played a prominent role in the civil wars in Bohemia during the reign of Wenceslas IV. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka's tactics were unorthodox and innovative. In addition to training and equipping his army according to their abilities, he used armored wagons armed with small cannons and muskets, presaging the tank of five hundred years later. He was also a master at using geography to full advantage as well as managing the discipline of his troops. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka is considered to be among the greatest military leaders and innovators of all time and is one of six commanders in history who never lost a battle (alongside Alexander the Great, Scipio Africanus, Genghis Khan, Alexander Suvorov, and Khalid ibn al-Walid).1
Grunwald
&lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka was on the winning side of the Battle of Grunwald, also called the 1st Battle of Tannenberg, one of the largest battles in Medieval Europe.23 It was fought on July 15, 1410, during the Polish&lt;U+2013&gt;Lithuanian&lt;U+2013&gt;Teutonic War. The alliance of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Jogaila (W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Jagie&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+0142&gt;o) and Grand Duke Vytautas (Witold), decisively defeated the Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership were killed or taken prisoner. The Knights never recovered their former power and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in their lands. The battle shifted the balance of power in Eastern Europe.
Rise to prominence
&lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka's name first became prominent during the Hussite Wars. The Hussites were a Christian movement following the teachings of Czech priest, philosopher, reformer, and master at Charles University in Prague, Jan Hus (c. 1369&lt;U+2013&gt;1415). On November 13, 1419 a temporary armistice was concluded between the partisans of King Sigismund, the last Emperor of the House of Luxemburg and the citizens of Prague. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka disapproved of this compromise and left Prague for Plze&lt;U+0148&gt;, one of the richest cities of the kingdom with his followers, but soon left that city. On March 25, 1420 he defeated the partisans of Sigismund at Sudom&lt;U+011B&gt;&lt;U+0159&gt;, the first pitched battle of the Hussite wars. He later arrived at T&lt;U+00E1&gt;bor, the then-recently established stronghold of the Hussite movement. The ecclesiastical organization of Tabor had a somewhat puritanical character with a very strict military discipline being instituted though the government was established on a thoroughly democratic basis. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka took a large part in the organization of the new military community and became one of the four captains of the people (hejtman) who were at its head.
Wagenburg tactics
 &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka helped develop tactics of using tabors, called vozov&lt;U+00E1&gt; hradba in Czech or Wagenburg by the Germans, as mobile fortifications. When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent they prepared carts for the battle by forming them into squares or circles. The carts were joined wheel to wheel by chains and positioned aslant, with their corners attached to each other, so that horses could be harnessed to them quickly, if necessary. In front of this wall of carts a ditch was dug by camp followers. The crew of each cart consisted of 16-22 soldiers: 4-8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6-8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails (the flail was the Hussite &quot;national weapon&quot;), 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers.
The Hussites' battle consisted of two stages, the first defensive, the second an offensive counterattack. In the first stage the army placed the carts near the enemy army and by means of artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle. The artillery would usually inflict heavy casualties at close range.
In order to avoid more losses, the enemy knights finally attacked. Then the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, weakening the enemy. The shooters aimed first at the horses, depriving the cavalry of its main advantage. Many of the knights died as their horses were shot and they fell.
As soon as the enemy's morale was lowered, the second stage, an offensive counterattack, began. The infantry and the cavalry burst out from behind the carts striking violently at the enemy - mostly from the flanks. While fighting on the flanks and being shelled from the carts the enemy was not able to put up much resistance. They were forced to withdraw, leaving behind dismounted knights in heavy armor who were unable to escape the battlefield. The enemy armies suffered heavy losses and the Hussites soon had the reputation of not taking captives.
Gunpowder weapons
The Hussite wars also marked the earliest successful use of pistols on the battlefield and &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka was an innovator in the use of gunpowder. He was the first European commander to maneuver on the field with cannon of medium caliber mounted on carts in between the wagons.4 The Czechs called the handgun a p&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+0161&gt;tala, and anti-infantry field guns houfnice, from which the English words &quot;pistol&quot; and &quot;howitzer&quot; have been derived. The Germans had just started corning gunpowder, making it suitable for use in smaller, tactical weapons. A gunman on an open field armed with only a single-shot weapon was no match for a charging knight on a horseback; however, from behind a castle wall, or from within the enclosure of the wagenburg, massed and disciplined gunmen could use the handgun to its greatest potential. From his experiences at the Battle of Grunwald, &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka knew exactly how his enemies would attack, and he found new ways to defeat forces numerically superior to his own.
Hussite Crusades
The Hussite Wars became one of the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation and though predominantly a religious movement it was also propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. The Catholic Church deemed Hus' teachings heretical. He was excommunicated in 1411, condemned by the Council of Constance, and burned at the stake in 1415. The wars proper began in July 1419, with the First Defenestration of Prague, when protesting Hussites threw the town councillors from the windows of the New Town Hall. It has been reputed that King Wenceslaus IV was so stunned by the defenestration that he died from the shock shortly after on 16 August 1419. This led to the armed conflict in which &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka would earn his fame.
The first anti-Hussite crusade
 King Sigismund was king of Hungary but only the titular king of Bohemia. Sigismund had acquired a claim on the Bohemian crown, though it was then, and remained till much later, in question whether Bohemia was an hereditary or an elective monarchy. A firm adherent of the Church of Rome, Sigismund was successful in obtaining aid from Pope Martin V, who issued a bill on 17 March 1420 which proclaimed a crusade &lt;U+201C&gt;for the destruction of the John Wycliffe, Hussites and all other heretics in Bohemia&quot;. Sigismund and many German princes arrived before the walls of Prague on June 30 at the head of a vast army of crusaders from all parts of Europe, largely consisting of adventurers attracted by the possibility of pillage. They immediately began a siege of the city and &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka was compelled to defend the Kingdom. He was a pragmatist in developing his military strategy. His army consisted of farmers and peasants, lacking both the funds and equipment to be classic soldiers with sword, horse and armor, &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka used their farmers' skills to boost their military efficiancy. He adapted the tools of agriculture into the tools of war. The agricultural flail was transformed into the flail.
Menaced by Sigismund, the citizens of Prague entreated the Taborites for assistance. Led by &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka and their other captains, the Taborites set out to take part in the defence of the capital. At Prague, &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka and his men took up a strong position on the hill just outside the city known as the V&lt;U+00ED&gt;tkov, now in &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;kov, a district of Prague named after the battle in his honour. On July 14 the armies of Sigismund made a general attack. A strong German Crusader-led force assaulted the position on the V&lt;U+00ED&gt;tkov, the stronghold that secured the Hussite communications with the open country. Thanks to &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka's personal leadership, the attack was thrown back and the forces of Sigismund abandoned the siege. A monument was erected on the top of this hill to honor Jan &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka (The statue has &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka sitting on the probably third largest bronze horse statue in the world. It is 9 meters or greater than 27 feet tall.)5 On August 22 the Taborites left Prague and returned to T&lt;U+00E1&gt;bor. Though Sigismund had retired from Prague, the castles of Vy&lt;U+0161&gt;ehrad and Hrad&lt;U+010D&gt;any remained in possession of his troops. The citizens of Prague laid siege to the Vy&lt;U+0161&gt;ehrad (see Battle of Vy&lt;U+0161&gt;ehrad), and towards the end of October the garrison was on the point of capitulating through famine. Sigismund attempted to relieve the fortress, but was decisively defeated by the Hussites on November 1 near the village of Pankr&lt;U+00E1&gt;c. The castles of Vy&lt;U+0161&gt;ehrad and Hrad&lt;U+010D&gt;any now capitulated, and shortly afterwards almost all Bohemia fell into the hands of the Hussites.
&lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka now engaged in constant warfare with the partisans of Sigismund, particularly with the powerful Romanist, Old&lt;U+0159&gt;ich II of Ro&lt;U+017E&gt;mberk. Through this struggle, the Hussites obtained possession of the greater part of Bohemia from Sigismund. It was proposed to elect the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas to the throne. However, the estates of Bohemia and Moravia met at &lt;U+010C&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;slav on June 1, 1421 and decided to appoint a provisional government, consisting of twenty members chosen from all the political and religious parties of the country. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka, who took part in the deliberations at &lt;U+010C&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;slav, was elected as one of the two representatives of T&lt;U+00E1&gt;bor.
&lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka summarily suppressed some disturbances on the part of a fanatical sect called the Adamites.
He continued his campaigns against the Romanists and the adherents of Sigismund, and having captured and rebuilt a small castle near Litom&lt;U+011B&gt;&lt;U+0159&gt;ice (Leitmeritz) he retained possession of it, the only reward for his great services that he ever received or claimed. According to the Hussite custom he gave the biblical name of Chalice (Kalich in Czech) to this new possession, and henceforth adopted the signature of &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka of the Chalice. Jan &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka didn't capture more estates during hussite wars. This fact wasn't usual at this time and made huge difference between &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka and his contemporaries.
Later that year he was severely wounded while besieging the castle of R&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;, and lost the use of his remaining eye. Though now totally blind, he continued to command the armies of T&lt;U+00E1&gt;bor.
The second anti-Hussite crusade
At the end of 1421, Sigismund, again attempted to subdue Bohemia and gained possession of the important town of Kutn&lt;U+00E1&gt; Hora. The mainly German citizens of the city killed a few of the Hussites in the town and closed the city to &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka, whose armies were camped outside the city walls. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka was at the head of the united armies of T&lt;U+00E1&gt;bor and Prague and though trapped managed to execute what some historians call the first mobile artillery manoeuver in history. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka broke through the enemy lines and retreated to Kol&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, but having received reinforcements he attacked and defeated Sigismund's unsuspecting army at the village of Nebovidy between Kol&lt;U+00ED&gt;n and Kutn&lt;U+00E1&gt; Hora on January 6, 1422. Sigismund lost 12,000 men and only escaped himself by rapid flight. Sigismund's forces made a last stand at N&lt;U+011B&gt;meck&lt;U+00FD&gt; Brod (Deutschbrod) on 10 January, but the city was stormed by the Czechs, and contrary to &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka's orders, its defenders were put to the sword.
Civil war
 Early in 1423, internal dissent among the Hussites led to civil war. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka, as leader of the Taborites, defeated the men of Prague and the Utraquist nobles at Ho&lt;U+0159&gt;ice on April 20. Shortly afterwards came news that a new crusade against Bohemia was being prepared. This induced the Hussites to conclude an armistice at Konopi&lt;U+0161&gt;t&lt;U+011B&gt; on June 24. As soon as the crusaders had dispersed, internal dissent broke out anew. During his temporary rule over Bohemia, Prince Sigismund Korybut of Lithuania had appointed Bo&lt;U+0159&gt;ek, the lord of Milet&lt;U+00ED&gt;nek, governor of the city of Hradec Kr&lt;U+00E1&gt;lov&lt;U+00E9&gt;. Bo&lt;U+0159&gt;ek belonged to a moderate Hussite faction, the Utraquist party. After the departure of Sigismund Korybut, the city of Hradec Kr&lt;U+00E1&gt;lov&lt;U+00E9&gt; refused to recognize Bo&lt;U+0159&gt;ek as its ruler, due to the democratic party gaining the upper hand. They called &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka to its aid. He acceded to the demand and defeated the Utraquists under Bo&lt;U+0159&gt;ek at the farm of Strachov, near the city of Hradec Kr&lt;U+00E1&gt;lov&lt;U+00E9&gt; on August 4, 1423.
&lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka now attempted to invade Hungary, which was under the rule of his old enemy King Sigismund. Though this Hungarian campaign was unsuccessful owing to the great superiority of the Hungarians, it ranks among the greatest military exploits of &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka, on account of the skill he displayed in retreat. In 1424, civil war having again broken out in Bohemia, &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka decisively defeated the &quot;Praguers&quot; and Utraquist nobles at Skalice on January 6, and at Male&lt;U+0161&gt;ov on June 7. In September, he marched on Prague. On the 14th of that month, peace was concluded between the Hussite parties through the influence of John of Rokycan, afterwards Utraquist archbishop of Prague. It was agreed that the now reunited Hussites should attack Moravia, part of which was still held by Sigismund's partisans, and that &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka should be the leader in this campaign. However, he died of the plague at P&lt;U+0159&gt;ibyslav on October 11, 1424 on the Moravian frontier. According to chronicler Piccolomini, &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka's dying wish was to have his skin used to make drums so that he might continue to lead his troops even after death. &lt;U+017D&gt;i&lt;U+017E&gt;ka was so well regarded that when he died, his soldiers called themselves the Orphans (sirotci) because they felt like they had lost their father. His enemies said that &quot;The one whom no mortal hand could destroy was extinguished by the finger of God&quot;.
He was succeeded by Prokop the Great.
