Nokian Tyres PLC () is a Finnish manufacturer of tyres for cars, trucks, buses and heavy duty equipment. Nokian is also known for its winter tyres. It is the largest manufacturer of car tyres in the Nordic region and also produces tyres in other countries.
The company has a long lineage, with corporate roots as a pulp mill in the Nokia, Finland area and later merging with a tire company. The company headquarters and main factory is located in Nokia, Finland. The company also sells tires and performs car servicing on the retail level through its Vianor subsidiary.
History
Nokia, Finland
The predecessors of the modern Nokia corporate entity includes the Nokia Aktiebolag (Nokia Company) and Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd).1 In 1865, mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a groundwood pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland.2 In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, Finland, fifteen kilometres (nine miles) west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta river, which had better resources for hydroelectric production. In 1871, Idestam, with the help of his close friend statesman Leo Mechelin, renamed and transformed his mills into a share company, thereby founding the Nokia Company.3
Suomen Gummitehdas Oy was founded in 1898. Car tyre production was started by the Suomen Gummitehdas Oy in 1932. The Hakkapeliitta tyre name was started in 19364 and some tyres sold under the Nokian tyre name still use the Hakkapeliitta model name.5 Hakkapeliitta (Finnish pl. hakkapeliitat) is a historiographical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman in the service of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648).6
In 1967, Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (which, by then, had changed the corporate name to Suomen Kumitehdas Oy) merged with both Suomen Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) and the forest and power industry company Nokia Aktiebolag to create Nokia Corporation.7 Nokian (which were earlier branded as Nokia tyres; Nokian is the genitive) was split from the then conglomerate Nokia (which later became the world's largest mobile phone vendor) when Nokia Corporation established Nokian Tyres Limited in 1988 as a joint venture company. Nokian Tyres PLC shares were floated on the Helsinki Stock Exchange (OMX Helsinki) in 1995. Nokia ended its ownership interest in Nokian Tyres in 2003, selling its shareholding of 2 million shares to Bridgestone Europe NV/SA, a subsidiary of the Japanese tyre manufacturer Bridgestone, for U.S. $73.2 million.8 This made Bridgestone the largest shareholder, with a 18.9% stake.9 Bridgestone announced then that Nokian would be operated independently, but that the idea of complementing each company's product development, testing, and distribution would be examined.10
Production of bicycle tires and inner tubes started in 1974 in Lieksa, Finland11 and continues at the present time.12 In the bicycle industry, the successor company remains one of the few manufacturers of tungsten carbide studded snow tyres. In 2004, Nokian Tyres sold its bicycle tyres business to Suomen Rengastehdas Oy13 for EUR 3.6 million14.
In 2007, Nokian began a joint venture, Ordabasy - Nokian Tyres JSC, with Ordabasy Corporation JSC, a multi-industry Kazakhstani company to manufacture passenger car tyres at a planned new factory in Kazakhstan. Nokian was to bring technical expertise to build a tyre factory and to produce tyres. The products were to be sold in Kazakhstan, Central-Asia, Russia and Eastern Europe.15
Nokian Tyres' three principal activities are the manufacture of passenger car tyres, heavy commercial tyres, and retail tyre sales.16 Nokian Tyre currently has the highest profit in the tire industry worldwide.17 In 2008, Nokia achieved &lt;U+20AC&gt;168.9 million profit on sales of &lt;U+20AC&gt;1.081 billion.18. Nokian has experienced strong revenue growth of 18% annually in the 2003-2007 period.19 Nokian Tyres is also publically traded on the Berlin Stock Exchange.20 Mr. Kim Gran is the President and Chief Executive Officer, having served since 1 September 2000 and having been a Vice President in the company for five years previous to that time.21
Tyre factories
Nokian produces 23,000 tyres per day at a factory in Nokia, Finland. The original factory was built in 1904. The current factory was built in 1945. It has been expanded several times since then.22 The company also has a 30 hectares road testing facility in Nokia, where it tests tyres from April to November. From November to May, the company tests tyres at their Ivalo Proving Grounds, a 700 hectare facility in the arctic Lapland.23
Nokian produces approximately 6,000 tyres daily and employes 510 employees at its factory in Vsevolozhsk, Russia near the city Saint Petersburg.2425 The factory was established in 2005.26 In 2006, it expanded its facilities there, adding a mixing department and a 19,000 square metre warehouse capable of housing approximately 600,000 tyres. The new mixing department gives the factory the capability to produce rubber compounds instead of importing them from the factory in Nokia, Finland. The Vsevolozhsk factory manufactures Nokian-branded car tyres, the majority of which are sold in Russia and countries of the former USSR.27
Nokian licenses production of its tyres to companies in the United States, Slovakia, Indonesia, and the People's Republic of China.28 Because of the short summer duration in Finland, Nokian tests summer tyres at other locations. During the northern winter, the testing of summer tyres is performed in South Africa.29 Nokian also tests tyres in Idiada, Spain, and Papenburg, Germany.30

Passenger car tyres
Nokian produces tyres for passenger cars, SUVs, and vans.31 Nokian tyres are sold in over 60 countries.
Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in the 1930s and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer.32 Nokian is known for its winter tyres33, which have been described as a critics' favorite34 and have been received favorable winter test results by several publications.3536 Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance which results in less fuel consumption/better gas mileage.3738
Nokian Tyres is the first tyre manufacturer in the world to have fully eliminated high-aromatic oils, which are used as plasticising agents in tread production and facilitates compounding of rubber and contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which is a carcinogen. Low aromatic oils have been used as replacement compounds.39 In 2006, Nokian Tyres received a commendation in the Finnish round of the European Business Awards for the Environment.40
Commercial vehicle tyres
Nokian manufactures truck and bus tyres under the Nokian Hakkapeliita name.41 Steer, traction, and trailer tyres are marketed.42 Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is a manufacturer of special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well as the replacement tyre market. Forestry tyres are a key product of the subsidiary and is a world market leader.43
Nokian also produces retreading materials. These are used to retread and refurbish used tyres. Nokian Noktop and industry competitor, Kraiburg, produce the most retreading materials for the European market.44 The RoadSnoop Pressure Watch, a tire pressure monitor for race cars, is also produced by Nokian.45
Vianor tyre chain franchise
Nokian Tyres owns 100% of Vianor Holding Oy46, which administers the Vianor tyre chain, the largest and most extensive tyre franchise in the Nordic countries with approximately 190 company owned retail outlets across Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Baltic countries, Ukraine, Russia and other countries and 470 total outlets, including franchises. Twelve outlets are located in the United States in the American states of Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts.47 Company owned outlets are located in the United States, Switzerland, Russia, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Estonia. Countries with only franchised outlets include Latvia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.48 There are also Vianor outlets in Armenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Poland.49
The Vianor name was launched in 1999 at the time of expansion to Finland and Estonia. Previously, Nokian had operated retail tire stores since 1987 in Norway with the acquisition of Larsen &amp; Lund50 and since 1998 in Sweden and Latvia.51 The Vianor name originates from the Latin phrase &lt;U+201C&gt;northern way&lt;U+201D&gt; or &quot;northern road&quot;52 and reflects the tyre chain's image as a tyre expert in winter conditions.53
Vianor sells approximately two million tyres annually including the Michelin and Bridgestone brands, in addition to Nokian tyres. Other car servicing and a tyre hotel service are offered.54 Tyre hotel services are facilities for customers to store summer or winter tyres during the off-season.55
