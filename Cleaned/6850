An Inconvenient Book is a non-fiction book on politics by Conservative Talk radio host and CNN Headline News commentator Glenn Beck. The full title is An Inconvenient Book: Real Solutions to the World&lt;U+2019&gt;s Biggest Problems.
The book also attributes persons other than Beck as partial writers of the book: Kevin Balfe, Steve &lt;U+201C&gt;Stu&lt;U+201D&gt; Burguiere, Dan Andros, and Paul Starke.1.
Explanation of the book's title
The title of An Inconvenient Book is a parody of the title of the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth, and one section of the book provides a response to the claims of Al Gore and other anthropogenic global warming advocates.
The book offers further explanation of the book&lt;U+2019&gt;s title: &lt;U+201C&gt;Have you ever wondered why some of the biggest problems we face, from illegal immigration to global warming to poverty, never seem to get fixed? The reason is simple: the solutions just aren&lt;U+2019&gt;t convenient&lt;U+2019&gt;. Fortunately, radio and television host Glenn Beck doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t care much about convenience; he cares about common sense&lt;U+201D&gt;2.
Issues discussed
Beck discusses his political views on a number of subjects. Issues include Beck&lt;U+2019&gt;s arguments that man made global warming is not a proven science, divorce rates, liberal bias on school campuses, the income gap, the anti-Americanism of the United Nations, and Illegal immigration.
