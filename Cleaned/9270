SS Ohioan was a cargo ship built in 1914 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. During World War I she was taken over by the United States Navy and ship commissioning commissioned as USS Ohioan ID-3280.
Ohioan was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships ordered by the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company for inter-coastal service cargo via the Panama Canal. When the canal was temporarily closed by landslides in late 1915, Ohioan sailed via the Straits of Magellan until the canal reopened in mid 1916. During World War I, USS Ohioan carried cargo, animals, and a limited number of passengers to France, and returned over 8,000 American troops after the Armistice with Germany Armistice, including the highly decorated American soldier Alvin York. After Ohioan's naval service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners.
Ohioan's post-war career was relatively uneventful until 8 October 1936, when she ran aground near Seal Rock San Francisco County, California Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, California San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo Joseph Rossi Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioan's hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioan's rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.
 Design and construction 
In May 1912, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for two new cargo shipsSS Iowan  2 and Ohioan.Maryland Steel Company Maryland Steel had built three shipsSS Kentuckian  2, Georgian, and Honolulanfor American-Hawaiian in 1909 in what proved to be a satisfactory arrangement for both companies. In September 1911 and November 1912, American-Hawaiian placed an order for Ohioan's six older sister ships; SS Minnesotan  2, SS Dakotan  2, SS Montanan  2, and SS Pennsylvanian  2 in the earlier order, SS Washingtonian  2 and SS Panaman  2 in the latter. The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal allowed for some of the nine installments could be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of Ohioan, including financing costs, was $73.58 per deadweight tonnage deadweight ton, which came out to just under $730,000.
Ohioan Maryland Steel yard no. 133 was the second ship built under the contract. She was ship naming and launching launched on 24 January 1914, and delivered to American-Hawaiian on 30 June. The ship was GRT 6,649 first=yes, and was convert 407 ft 7 in m in length length between perpendiculars between perpendiculars and convert 53 ft 8 in m beam nautical abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of DWT 9,920 long, and her cargo holds, which had a storage capacity of convert 438154 cuft, were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the West Coast of the United States West Coastsuch as fresh produce from Southern California farmsto the East Coast of the United States East Coast.cite news   title = California cargo of produce shipped to East   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 3 October 1914   page = II-8  Ohioan had a single steam engine powered by oil-fired boilers that drove a single screw propeller at a speed of convert 12 knots km/h.Cochran and Ginger, p. 357.
 Early career 
When Ohioan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast of the United States East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast of the United States West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa.Prior to the 21 April 1914 United States occupation of Veracruz, American-Hawaiian had used the Tehuantepec Route, but after the U.S. action, that route was closed by the Victoriano Huerta Huerta-led Mexican government. Shipments on that Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican portsSalina Cruz Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargoand would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. See: Hovey, p. 78. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, but westbound cargoes were more general in nature.Cochran and Ginger, p. 35556. Following the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August 1914, American-Hawaiian ships switched to take that route.Cochran and Ginger, p. 360.
As World War I continued in Europe and increased the demand for defense-related shipping, American-Hawaiian stopped its sugar service. Ohioan's specific activities during this time are not known. She may have been in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was ship chartering chartered for transatlantic service, or she may have been in the group of American-Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America, delivering coal, gasoline, and steel in exchange for coffee, nitrates, cocoa, rubber, and manganese manganese ore.Cochran and Ginger, p. 362.
 World War I 
Unlike her surviving sister ships,SS Washingtonian  2 had been in a collision and sank in New York Harbor in January 1915. there is no evidence that Ohioan was ever ship chartering chartered by the United States Army;SS Dakotan  2, SS Montanan  2, SS Pennsylvanian  2, SS Minnesotan  2, SS Panaman  2, and SS Iowan  2 had all been chartered by the U.S. Army and most carried cargo and horses in that duty. Montanan was torpedoed and sunk while in Army service in 1917. Ohioan's activities between the United States' declaration of war on German Empire Germany in April 1917, and her acquisition by the United States Navy on 5 August 1918, are unknown. She was commissioned into the NOTS first=yes two days later, under a ship chartering loan charter. After a refit and taking on a load of cargo, Ohioan sailed for Saint-Nazaire, France, where she arrived on 29 August. Dividing the next month between that port and Brest, France Brest, Ohioan sailed for New York on 1 October.  Fitted there with horse stalls, she loaded 60officers and men,Crowell and Wilson, p. 562. and equestrian and general cargo, before sailing on 1 November for La Pallice harbour La Pallice.

With the signing of the Armistice with Germany Armistice on 11 November the fighting came to an end, and the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.Gleaves, p. 31. Upon her return to the United States on 5 December, Ohioan was selected to become a troop transport and transferred from the NOTS to the Cruiser and Transport Force. Before she could begin returning troops, Ohioan had to be converted from a cargo and animal ship. Although sources do not indicate the specific modifications Ohioan underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard.Crowell and Wilson, p. 316. Similar modifications on Ohioan's sister ship USS Minnesotan ID-4545 2 took three months,cite DANFS   author = Naval Historical Center   title = Minnesotan   url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m11/minnesotan.htm   short = on  but it is not known how long Ohioan's refit took.
In March, Ohioan returned 1,627men to New York, mostly from the 348th Infantry Regiment of the 87th Infantry Division United States U.S. 87th Infantry Division,cite news   url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9404E1DB1E39E13ABC4A52DFB5668382609EDE   format = pdf   title = More 27th troops return from front   work = The New York Times   date = 12 March 1919   accessdaymonth = 25 August   accessyear = 2008   page = 8  followed by another 1,596&nbsp;officers and men, and 1,000&nbsp;homing pigeons on 16 April.

On 20 June, Ohioan returned another load of troops that included Base Hospital 98,cite news   title = The friend of the soldier   work = Chicago Daily Tribune   date = 17 June 1919   page = 8  and the 20th Engineers.cite news   title = The friend of the soldier   work = Chicago Daily Tribune   date = 1 July 1919   page = 8  By the time Ohioan had completed her sixth and final trooping voyage on 16 September 1919, Ohioan had carried home 8,383 healthy and wounded men. USS Ohioan was decommissioned on 6 October 1919, and returned to American-Hawaiian.
 Later career 
Image:US Soldiers on deck of USS Ohioan, 1919.jpg right thumb U.S. soldiers crowd the deck during their return home on USS Ohioan
Ohioan resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Although the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by that time,Cochran and Ginger, p. 363 Ohioan continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal relatively uneventfully for the next 17&nbsp;years.
In early morning hours of 8 October 1936, however, Ohioan ran aground near Seal Rock San Francisco County, California Seal Rock on the south shore of the Golden Gate, just outside San Francisco Bay. The ship, sailing in a dense fog, strayed too close to shore and grounded on the rocks, sending a shower of sparks that lit up the night.Sprout and Sprout, p. 54. When the fog cleared later in the morning, the ship was firmly seated on the rocks at the base of a convert 250 ft m sing=on cliff, and some convert 300 ft m from the mainland. United States Coast Guard Coast Guardsmen on shore attached three lines to the ship and set up a breeches buoy to take off the harbor pilot, but the crew stayed on board the ship in hopes that the high tide would free her from the rocky perch. As word of the shipwreck spread, spectators clambered over the cliff to get a view of the scene; one man died from a heart attack and two women broke ankles in separate falls. Newsboys soon arrived on the scene, selling newspapers telling of Ohioan's woe within sight of the stranded ship. Policemen were called out to keep order as the crowd grew into the thousands.
The next day, as the seas battered the ship and drove her farther on the rocks, two Coast Guard boats took 31 men from the ship.Three officers and two cooks remained on board Ohioan to prevent a completely abandoned ship from becoming a salvage prize. American-Hawaiian announced that a Los Angeles salvage firm had been hired to retrieve the convert 1500 LT t -1 adj=on cargo,cite news   agency = Associated Press   title = 31 saved off ship as crowds watch    work = The New York Times   date = 10 October 1936   page = 19  which included explosives and oil.cite news   title = Flames menace explosives   work = The Washington Post   date = 7 March 1937   page = 13  Two heavy-duty electric pumps were lowered to the ship via the breeches buoy, and plans were drawn up for connecting them to the San Francisco municipal electric system in order to pump out the ship.

The crowds of onlookers continued to watch as salvage efforts progressed; a 75-year-old woman from Oakland, California Oakland fell down the embankment while watching the action on 13 October.cite news   agency = Associated Press   title = Woman viewing ship salvaging injured   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 14 October 1936   page - 12  The mayor of San Francisco, Angelo Joseph Rossi Angelo J. Rossi, rode the breeches buoy to the ship and toured it for 45minutes on 19 October.cite news   agency = Associated Press   title = Bay City mayor visits stranded ship   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 19 October 1936   page = 3  On 22 October, the Los Angeles Times ran an Associated Press story saying that marine experts were considering the use of a method first patented by Abraham Lincoln in May 1849 in order to re-float the stranded ship.cite news   agency = Associated Press   title = Lincoln's old patent found   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 22 October 1936   page = 10 The patent, No. 6469, dated 22 May 1849, was entitled Buoying vessels over shoals. All efforts, however, were unsuccessful, and by 31 October, American-Hawaiian placed an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times requesting bids for the purchase of the ship and her cargo as and where she now lies... on the rocks near Point Lobos, San Francisco.cite news   title = For Sale: S. S. Ohioan and Cargo...   format = display advertisement   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 31 October 1936   page = 6  E. J. Mitchell was the winning bidder, securing rights to the ship and its cargo for $2,800.
In March 1937, five months after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioanstill aground near Seal Rockcaught fire when a watchman aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck.cite news   title = Grounded for five months ...   work = The Washington Post   date = 8 March 1937   page = 5  A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two.cite news   title = Havoc wrought by storms, east and west   work = Chicago Daily Tribune   date = 12 December 1937   page = 2  By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioan's rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.Riesenberg, p. 216.
Author Mark Ellis Thomas suggests that English poet and novelist Malcolm Lowry may have been inspired by the wreck of Ohioan in his poem In Tempest's Tavern. One excerpt from the poem refers to The Ohio sic smoking in Frisco on a sharp pen / Of rock. At the time of Ohioan's grounding, Lowry was in San Diego, California San Diego, preparing to sail to Acapulco.Thomas, p. 233.
