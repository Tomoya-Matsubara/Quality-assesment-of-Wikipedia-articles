Federer is an all-court, all-round player known for his fluid style of play and shot making. Federer mainly plays from the baseline but is also comfortable at the net being one of the best volleyers in the game today. David Foster Wallace described Federer's exceptional speed, fluidity and brute force of this forehand motion as a great liquid whip,cite news  url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html?ex=1313726400&en=716968175e36505e&ei=5090  author=David Foster Wallace  title=Federer as Religious Experience  date=2006-08-20  work=Play Magazine  publisher=New York Times accessdate=2007-06-21 while John McEnroe has referred to Federer's forehand as the greatest shot in our sport.cite web url=http://msn.foxsports.com/other/story/6741576?MSNHPHCP&GT1=10035 title=Who's the best athlete in the world right now? author=Kevin Hench date=7 May 2007 publisher=Fox Sports accessdate=2009-03-31 Federer plays with a single-handed backhand which gives him great variety. He employs the use of the Backspin slice, can also fire top-spin winning shots and he also possesses a 'flick' backhand where he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His Serve tennis serve is difficult to read because he tosses the ball in the same spot no matter where he intends to serve it and he turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200&nbsp;km/h 125&nbsp;mph,cite web url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/stats/day19/1701ms.html title=Match Statistics: Federer vs. Murray author=Australianopen.com accessdate=2010-02-16cite web url=http://2009.wimbledon.org/en_GB/scores/stats/day21/1701ms.html title=Match Statistics:Federer vs. Roddick author=Wimbledon.org accessdate=2010-02-16cite web url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/wimbledon08/columns/story?columnist=ubha_ravi&id=3471097 title=Federer's serve allowing him to manufacture easy points author=Ubha, Ravi publisher=ESPN.com date=2008-07-02 accessdate=2010-02-16 however, he is capable of serving at 220&nbsp;km/h 137&nbsp;mph Federer also utilizes a well-disguised drop shot off of both wings.cite web url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article6540564.ece author=Jamie Murray title=Drop shot can be Andy Murray's deadly weapon on grass publisher=Timesonline.com date=2009-06-22 accessdate=2010-02-16
