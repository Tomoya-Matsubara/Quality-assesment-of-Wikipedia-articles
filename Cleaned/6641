Pontiff or Pontificate was a title of certain religious leaders, now used principally to refer to the Pope.
Etymology
The term derives from the French word pontife, from the Latin pontifex, a title used for high priests of the Roman Empire. The word pontifex is commonly held to derive from the Latin root words pons, &quot;bridge&quot; + facere, &quot;to do&quot; or &quot;to make&quot;, with a literal meaning of &quot;bridge-builder&quot;. This, however, is disputed - it may be only a folk etymology.1 See Pontifex Maximus for more details on the original Roman term.
Usage in the Catholic Church
Pontiffs were originally simply chiefs or high priests of any religion; thus writers from the 16th through to the 18th centuries referred equally to Christian pontiffs (bishops) and &quot;Mahometan [Muslim] Pontiffs&quot; (caliphs) or Swami ( Hindu ). Over time, however, the term became associated with the highest religious authority in the Catholic Church &lt;U+2014&gt; the Pope. It is often modified by an adjective - for instance, &quot;Supreme Pontiff&quot;, &quot;Sovereign Pontiff&quot;, &quot;Roman Pontiff&quot; - to distinguish the Pope from &quot;ordinary&quot; pontiffs.2
In the modern era, the modifying adjective is usually dropped, with the term being used exclusively to refer to the Pope, as in &quot;The Pope visited Cuba in 1998, the first visit by a reigning pontiff to the island.&quot;
