Early years
Ameondola attended The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, Texas, under coach Weldon Willig.1 He completed his high school career by leading his team to its first ever Texas State championship game. Although they lost to North Shore High School, Amendola finished his senior season with 1,045 receiving yards, 129 rushing yards, and 8 touchdowns.2
College career
 Amendola finished his college career at Texas Tech with 204 receptions for 2,246 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also returned 116 punts for 1,283 yards and one TD, an 11.06 yards per return average ranking Amendola third all-time in school history in punt returns and yardage, behind only Wes Welker and Tyrone Thurman.3 Amendola's best year was his senior year, in which he was overshadowed by teammate Michael Crabtree, but still recorded 109 catches for 1,245 yards and 6 TDs.4
During the 2005 season, Amendola made two memorable plays that led to Red Raider victories. The first was late in the 2005 game against Oklahoma. Tech was trailing. On fourth down, a Cody Hodges pass attempt was tipped, and Amendola made a leaping catch in traffic. He was tackled immediately and appeared to have been stopped just short of a first down. However, the spot was reviewed by the replay officials and the final spot of the ball resulted in a first down. The drive was kept alive and resulted in yet another disputed call&lt;U+2014&gt;Taurean Henderson's stretch over the goal line on the final play of regulation, which gave the Red Raiders the victory over the Sooners.5
Another game-changing play came when Amendola recovered the fumble from an intercepted pass during the final drive of the 2005 game against Nebraska. Tech needed a touchdown to win. Tech quarterback Cody Hodges' pass was tipped and intercepted. Instead of taking a knee to seal the victory, the Nebraska defender decided to run with the ball and had it stripped. Amendola dove for the loose ball and recovered it.6 Tech retained possession, resulting in a game-winning touchdown pass from Hodges to Joel Filani on fourth down with under 30 seconds remaining.7 Amendola graduated with a major in Communication Studies.8
