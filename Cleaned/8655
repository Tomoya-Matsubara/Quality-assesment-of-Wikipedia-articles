Lisa del Giocondo (June 15 1479 – July 15 1542 or c. 1551), born and also known as Lisa Gherardini, Lisa di Antonio Maria (Antonmaria) Gherardini and Elisabetta Gherardini, also known as Lisa del Gioconda, was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany in Italy. Her name was given to Mona Lisa, her portrait commissioned by her husband and painted by Leonardo da Vinci during the Italian Renaissance.
Little is known about Lisa's life. Married as a teenager to a cloth and silk merchant who later became a local official, she was mother to five children and led what is thought to have been a comfortable and ordinary middle-class life. Lisa outlived her husband, who was about 20 years her senior.
Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa became the world's most famous painting1 and took on a life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made the work of art a globally-recognized icon and an object of commercialization. During the early 21st century, a discovery made at a university library was powerful enough evidence to end speculation about the sitter's identity, and reunited Lisa's portrait with her person.
Life and family
 Lisa was the daughter of Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini and Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de Carducci, who married in 1466 and lived on farm income. The family lived in Florence, originally near Santa Trinita and later in rented space near Santo Spirito, most likely because they could not afford repairs to their former house when it was damaged. They also owned a small country home in St. Donato in the village of Poggio about  south of the city.2
On March 5, 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo (1460&lt;U+2013&gt;1528 or c. 15393), a modestly successful cloth and silk merchant, becoming his third wife at age 15. Francesco's first two wives, Camilla di Mariotto Rucellai whom he married in 1491 and Tommasa di Mariotto Villani whom he married in 1493, both may have died in childbirth. Lisa's dowry was 170 florins and land near her family's country home, a sign that the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband loved each other. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer than her own.4 Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an &quot;old name&quot;.5
 Lisa and Francesco had five children: Piero, Camilla, Andrea, Giocondo and Marietta, four of them between 1496 and 1507.6 One of their daughters died in 1499 and was buried in the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella.7 Lisa's stepmother Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai and Francesco's first wife, both members of the prominent Rucellai family, were sisters. Lisa and her new family lived in shared accommodation until March 5, 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.89
Francesco became an official in Florence. He was elected to the Dodici Buonomini in 1499 and to the Signoria in 1512, where he was confirmed as a Priori in 1524. He may have had ties to Medici family political or business interests. In 1512 when the government of Florence feared the return of the Medici from exile, Francesco was imprisoned and fined 1,000 florins. He was released in September when the Medici returned.1011
In one account by an amateur scholar, Francesco died in the plague of 1528. Lisa fell ill and was taken by her daughter Marietta, a nun, to the convent of Sant'Orsola, where she died about four years later at the age of 63.1213 In a scholarly account of their lives, Francesco lived to be 80 years old. He died in 1539, and Lisa may have lived until at least 1551, when she would have been 71 or 72.14
Mona Lisa
 Like other Florentines of their financial means, Francesco's family were art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolommeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco at the family's burial site in the Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze. Andrea del Sarto painted a Madonna for another member of his family.15 Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait of his wife and to Domenico Puligo for a painting of Saint Francis of Assisi. He is thought to have commissioned Lisa's portrait to celebrate both Andrea's birth and the purchase of the family's home.16
Mona Lisa fulfilled 15th- and early 16th-century requirements for portraying a woman of virtue. The position of Lisa's right hand, which rests over her left, signals that she was a faithful wife. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were a Spanish-influenced high fashion style; they are not a depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is also strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.17
 Leonardo had no income during the spring of 1503, which may in part explain his interest in a private portrait.1819 But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting the The Battle of Anghiari which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February 1505.20 In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished.21 He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client.22 The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life and he may have completed Mona Lisa many years later in France,23 in one estimation by 1516.24
The painting's title dates to 1550. An acquaintance of at least some of Francesco's family,25 Giorgio Vasari wrote, &quot;Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife&quot;26 ().27 The portrait's Italian (La Gioconda) and French (La Joconde) titles are Lisa's married name as well as nickname28&lt;U+2014&gt;in English, &quot;jocund&quot; or the &quot;the happy one&quot;.
Speculation assigned Lisa's name to at least four different paintings29 and her identity to at least ten different people.30 By the end of the 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in over 300 other paintings and in 2,000 advertisements that appeared at the rate of a new advertisement each week.31 In 2005, an expert at the University Library of Heidelberg discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa.32
Francis I purchased the Mona Lisa for 4,000 gold crowns to add it to the art collection at Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau de Fontainebleau,33 most likely through the heirs34 of Leonardo's assistant Salai. The people of France have owned it since the French Revolution.35 Today about 6 million people visit Mona Lisa each year at the Louvre in Paris, where it is part of a French national collection.36
