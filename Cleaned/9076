British war crimes are crimes committed by the armed forces of the United Kingdom from its formation in 1707 to the present day. Actions labeled &quot;war crimes&quot; range from independent actions of individual soldiers, such as the abuse of prisoners in the Iraq War,1 to officially sanctioned actions such as the bombing of Dresden in 1945.23
India
Some crimes reportedly perpetrated by UK troops during the suppression of India's 1857 uprising were recorded in passing.  These included widespread summary executions across the countryside, particularly by forces under the command of Neill and Renaud, as well as the indiscriminate murder of civilians during the capture of Delhi and the summary execution of the princes of Delhi and other Indian leaders.4
The massacre of Amritsar occurred on 13 April 1919 when British troops fired on a crowd of unarmed Indian protesters, killing 379 - 1,000 people.56 The incident left a permanent scar on Indo-British relations and was the prelude to Mahatma Gandhi&lt;U+2019&gt;s noncooperation movement of 1920&lt;U+2013&gt;22.7
Boer War
 During the later stages of the Second Boer War, the British Empire ordered the civilian internment of the Afrikaner population into concentration camps,8 one of the earliest uses of this method by modern powers.910 Though intended as a humanitarian gesture to protect the civilian population from the British Army's scorched earth policy, the women and children were rounded up and transported to the camps in open cattle trucks in freezing rain during winter, without being given adequate food and water.11 Many Afrikaners consider these to be war crimes,1213 which ended with the deaths of around 34,000 people.14 A later Prime Minister, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, declared in the British Parliament on 14 June 1901: &quot;When is a war not a war? When it is waged in South Africa by methods of barbarism.&quot;15
World War I
Two German submarines, U-27 and U-41 were sunk by the British Q-ship HMS Baralong between August and September 1915. In the first case, a number of survivors were summarily executed by Baralong&lt;U+00B4&gt;s crewmembers under orders of Lieutenant Godfrey Herbert on 19 August 1915. The massacre was reported to a newspaper by American citizens on board Nicosia, a British freighter loaded with war supplies which was stopped by U-27 just minutes before the incident.16 On 24 September, Baralong destroyed U-41, which was in the process of sinking the cargo ship Urbino. According to Karl Goetz, the U-41's commander, the British vessel continued flying the U.S. flag after opening fire on the submarine, and the lifeboat carrying the German survivors was rammed and sunk by the British Q-ship.17
Chemical weapons in warfare
Poison gas was introduced by Imperial Germany, and was subsequently used by all major belligerents (including Britain) in the war against enemy soldiers, in violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited the use of &quot;poison or poisoned weapons&quot; in warfare.1819
Irish War of Independence
On 9 August 1920, the British Parliament passed the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act during the Anglo-Irish War. It replaced the trial by jury by courts-martial by regulation for those areas in Ireland where IRA activity was prevalent.20 To break the Irish Republican Army, Winston Churchill, then UK Secretary of State for War, suggested recruiting World War I veterans into paramilitary units. Lloyd George agreed and advertisements were filed in British newspapers. Former enlisted men were formed into the Black and Tans, so called because of their mixture of British Army and police uniforms. Veterans who had held officers rank were formed into the Auxiliary Division, who were better paid and received better supplies. 
Kevin Barry, an 18-year-old medical student and Irish Republican Army paramilitary, was captured following a gun battle between IRA paramilitaries and British soldiers, which resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers, Privates Humphries, Washington and Whitehead, at least two of whom were around the same age as Barry.21 Following his capture, Barry was interrogated and allegedly subjected to violence and threats of murder by British soldiers.22 The British Government denied POW status to IRA paramilitaries and Barry was reportedly interrogated under torture by British servicemen without access to a solicitor or civilian constable. He refused to name the others present at the ambush, and was subsequently charged and convicted of first degree murder by a military tribunal on 28 October 1919, and executed by hanging on 1 November 1919.23 John Ainsworth, author of Kevin Barry, the Incident at Monk's bakery and the Making of an Irish Republican Legend, has pointed out that Barry had been captured by the British not as a uniformed soldier but disguised as a civilian and in possession of flat-nosed &quot;Dum-dum&quot; bullets, in contravention of the Hague Convention of 1899.24
Bloody Sunday began when Michael Collins' assassin squad, known as &quot;The Twelve Apostles&quot;, assassinated 13 British intelligence agents, including most of the &quot;Cairo Gang&quot;. That same afternoon, British security forces opened fire on a crowd attending a Gaelic football match in Croke Park, killing 14 civilians.25
Iraqi revolt (1920)
During the first years of British rule in Iraq, numerous attacks on civilians were carried out, including village burning and indiscriminate bombing.26
World War II
Crimes against prisoners, civilians, and civilian property
In violation of the Hague Conventions, British line of communication troops conducted small scale looting in Bayeux and Caen in France, following their liberation, during Operation Overlord.27 At Seedorf, in Germany, British armoured forces randomly selected and burned two cottages on 21 April 1945, as a reprisal against local civilians who had hidden German soldiers in their cellars.28
On 23 May 1945, British troops in Schleswig-Holstein, after holding at gunpoint Prince Ferdinand of Holstein, plundered Gl&lt;U+00FC&gt;cksburg castle, stealing jewelry, and desecrating 38 coffins from the castle's mausoleum.29 The British Government closed public access to the official report about the incident for 75 years.30
The &quot;London Cage&quot;, a MI19 prisoner of war facility in the United Kingdom during and immediately after the war, was subject to allegations of torture.31 The Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre in occupied Germany, managed by the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, was the subject of an official inquiry in 1947, which found that there was &quot;mental and physical torture during the interrogations&quot; and that &quot;personal property of the prisoners were stolen&quot;.32
Unrestricted submarine warfare
In response to Germany's intensive unrestricted submarine warfare during the Battle of the Atlantic and its invasion of Denmark and Norway, the British Navy carried on its own unrestricted submarine warfare contrary to the 1936 Second London Naval Treaty after the British Admiralty announced on 4 May 1940 that all vessels in the Skagerrak were to be sunk on sight without warning.3334
Rapes
Austin J. App's book, Ravishing the Women of Conquered Europe, claims that some 2,000,000 German women were raped in 1945, not only by members of the Red Army but also by American and British troops.35 According to writer Sean Longden, although far from the scale of those committed by the Soviets, rapes of local women were a common feature among British troops in Germany. Even elderly women were targeted. The Royal Military Police tended to turn a blind eye towards abuse of German prisoners and civilians but rape was a major issue for them. Some officers reportedly treated this behaviour with leniency.36
Many rapes resulted from alcohol or post-traumatic stress, but there were also instances of premeditated attacks, such as the assault on three German women in the town of Neustadt am R&lt;U+00FC&gt;bemberge and the attempted gang-rape of two local girls at gunpoint in the village of Oyle, near Nienburg, which ended in the death of one of the women when a soldier (it is not clear if unintentionally or otherwise) discharged his gun, striking her in the neck. There were also reports of &quot;sexual assault and offences&quot; committed by British soldiers against children in Belgium and the Netherlands; a number of servicemen were convicted of these crimes while fraternizing with Dutch and Belgian families during the winter of 1944-45.37
Bombing of Dresden
The British, with other allied nations (mainly the U.S.) carried out air raids against enemy cities during World War II, including the bombing of the German city of Dresden, which killed more than 25,000 people. While &quot;no agreement, treaty, convention or any other instrument governing the protection of the civilian population or civilian property&quot; from aerial attack was adopted before the war,38 the Hague Conventions did prohibit the bombardment of undefended towns. Allied forces inquiry concluded that an air attack on Dresden was militarily justified on the grounds the city was defended.39
This city was filled with refugees fleeing the oncoming Red Army.4041 When asked whether the bombing of Dresden was a war crime, British historian Frederick Taylor replied: &quot;I really don't know. From a practical point of view, rules of war are something of a grey area. It was pretty borderline stuff in terms of the extent of the raid and the amount of force used.&quot;42 Historian Donald Bloxham claims that &quot;the bombing of Dresden on 13&lt;U+2013&gt;14 February 1945 was a war crime&quot;. He further argues that there was a strong prima facie for trying Winston Churchill among others and that there is theoretical case that he could have been found guilty. &quot;This should be a sobering thought. If, however it is also a startling one, this is probably less the result of widespread understanding of the nuance of international law and more because in the popular mind 'war criminal', like 'paedophile' or 'terrorist', has developed into a moral rather than a legal categorisation.&quot;43
Malaya
The Batang Kali massacre involved the indiscriminate killing of 24 unarmed villagers by British troops on 12 December 1948 during the Malayan Emergency.44 British authorities do not recognise the event,45 although six of the eight soldiers interviewed under caution by detectives corroborated accounts that the villagers had been unlawfully killed.46
Kenya
The Hola massacre was an incident during the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya against British colonial rule at a colonial detention camp in Hola, Kenya. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded &lt;U+201C&gt;closed camp&lt;U+201D&gt;. This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial &quot;rehabilitation process&quot; or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action &lt;U+2013&gt; as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.47 77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries.48 The British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.49
Northern Ireland
Various unarmed male civilians (some of whom were named during a 2013 television programme) were shot, two (Patrick McVeigh, Daniel Rooney) fatally, in 1972, allegedly by the Military Reaction Force (MRF), an undercover military unit tasked with targeting Irish Republican Army paramilitaries during the last installment of the Troubles. Two brothers, whose names and casualty status were not mentioned in an article regarding the same matter in The Irish Times, ran a fruit stall in west Belfast, and were shot after being mistaken for IRA paramilitaries.50
&quot;We were hunting down hardcore baby-killers, terrorists, people that would kill you without even thinking about it ... If you had a player who was a well-known shooter who carried out quite a lot of assassinations ... then he had to be taken out&quot;, several soldiers stated during interviews with the British news series Panorama.51
Falklands War
In 1993, Argentina's president, Carlos Menem, ordered an investigation into allegations that Argentine soldiers captured during the Battle of Mount Longdon had been executed by British paratroopers. The statements  were said to confirm seven executions.52
Former corporal Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Carrizo claimed British paratroopers shot him in the head after he had surrendered.53 Carrizo's reports were confirmed by another soldier named as Santiago Mambrin.54 Then commander of land forces in the Falklands, former Brigadier-General Oscar Jofre pointed out that &quot;I never heard of anything like this happening, throughout the war or after it. If it happened, it was something that happens in every war, not accepting surrender through tiredness or fear or because of the loss of comrades. Of course it is not the norm, but since soldiers are men they can deviate from the norm.&quot;55
In 1994, The Independent (newspaper), using eyewitness statements from both Argentine and British soldiers, revealed new evidence about alleged British war crimes. Nestor Flores, stated that he had seen British soldiers shoot a wounded, unarmed soldier called Quintana; stab to death with a bayonet another one named Gramissi; and toss a grenade into a foxhole where a soldier surnamed Delgado was lying.56 The British Government dispatched a team of Scotland Yard detectives to Argentina to investigate the allegations. A report of the results of this investigation was submitted. It was referred to the public prosecutor, Dame Barbara Mills, who determined that the evidence was insufficient for prosecution. The Scotland Yard investigation kept the total number of interviewees and the content of their statements secret &quot;because we think that to do otherwise would damage the integrity of the investigation. However, we are very grateful to those who volunteered to speak to us, as well as to the Argentine authorities for their cooperation.&quot;57
Iraq War
Corporal Donald Payne (born 9 September 1970)58 is a former soldier of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment of the British Army who became the first member of the British armed forces to be convicted of a war crime under the provisions of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 when he pleaded guilty on 19 September 2006 to a charge of inhumane treatment.5960 He was jailed for one year and dismissed from the army as a result of his actions.61
Afghan War
In 2011 a Royal Marine Sergeant, identified as Sergeant Alexander Blackman from Taunton, Somerset,62 was convicted at court martial in Wiltshire of having murdered an unarmed, reportedly wounded Afghan fighter in Helmand Province.63 On 6 December 2013 Sergeant Blackman received a life sentence, with a minimum of ten years before he is eligible for parole, from the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire. Furthermore he has been dismissed with disgrace from the Royal Marines.6465
