 Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n Buddhism (&lt;U+79AA&gt;&lt;U+5B97&gt; Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n T&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng) is the Vietnamese name for the Zen school of Buddhism. Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n is ultimately derived from Chinese Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Z&lt;U+014D&gt;ng (&lt;U+79AA&gt;&lt;U+5B97&gt;).
History
According to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580, an Indian monk named Vin&lt;U+012B&gt;taruci () traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chinese Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. This, then, would be the first appearance of Vietnamese Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n Buddhism.
The sect that Vin&lt;U+012B&gt;taruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n. After a period of obscurity, the Vin&lt;U+012B&gt;taruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly so under the patriarch V&lt;U+1EA1&gt;n-H&lt;U+1EA1&gt;nh (died 1018).
Other early Vietnamese Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n schools included that of Wu Yantong, called V&lt;U+00F4&gt; Ng&lt;U+00F4&gt;n Th&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng in Vietnamese, which was associated with the teaching of Mazu Daoyi, and the Th&lt;U+1EA3&gt;o &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+01B0&gt;&lt;U+1EDD&gt;ng, which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks. A new school was founded by one of Vietnam's religious kings; this was the Tr&lt;U+00FA&gt;c L&lt;U+00E2&gt;m school, which evinced a deep influence from Confucian and Taoist philosophy. Nevertheless, Tr&lt;U+00FA&gt;c L&lt;U+00E2&gt;m's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court.
In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguy&lt;U+00EA&gt;n Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;u established a vigorous new school, the L&lt;U+00E2&gt;m T&lt;U+1EBF&gt;, which is the Vietnamese pronunciation of Linji. A more domesticated offshoot of L&lt;U+00E2&gt;m T&lt;U+1EBF&gt;, the Li&lt;U+1EC5&gt;u Qu&lt;U+00E1&gt;n school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n.
Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n master Th&lt;U+00ED&gt;ch Thanh T&lt;U+1EEB&gt; is credited for renovating Tr&lt;U+00FA&gt;c L&lt;U+00E2&gt;m in Vietnam. He is one of the most prominent and influential Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n masters currently alive. He was a disciple of Master Th&lt;U+00ED&gt;ch Thi&lt;U+1EC7&gt;n Hoa.
The most famous practitioner of syncretized Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n Buddhism in the West is Th&lt;U+00ED&gt;ch Nh&lt;U+1EA5&gt;t H&lt;U+1EA1&gt;nh who has authored dozens of books and founded Dharma center Plum Village in France together with his colleague, Thi&lt;U+1EC1&gt;n Master bhikkhuni Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;n Kh&lt;U+00F4&gt;ng.
