J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht (also Jambert, Jaenbeorht,1 J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nbert, Jaenberht, Jaenbert, or Jaenberht; died 792) was a medieval monk, and later the abbot, of St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury who was named Archbishop of Canterbury in 765. As archbishop, he had a difficult relationship with King Offa of Mercia, who at one point confiscated lands from the archbishopric. By 787, some of the bishoprics under Canterbury's supervision were transferred to the control of the newly-created Archbishopric of Lichfield, although it is not clear if J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht ever recognized its legitimacy. Besides the issue with Lichfield, J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht also presided over church councils in England. He died in 792 and was considered a saint after his death.
Early life
J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was a monk at St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury before being selected as abbot of that monastic house.2 He came from a prominent family in the kingdom of Kent, and a kinsman of his, Eadhun, was the reeve of King Egbert II of Kent. J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht himself was on good terms with Egbert.3
Archbishop of Canterbury
J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on 2 February 765,4 at the court of King Offa of Mercia; this location implies that his election was acceptable to the king.5 In 766, he received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority given by the papacy. At this time, Kent had been subjected by Offa; in 776, perhaps at the urging of J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht, Kent rebelled and secured its freedom.6 In 780 and 781, J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht attended church councils at Brentford that were led by King Offa. Although initially on good terms with Offa, J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's ties to Egbert were also strong: after the Battle of Otford, Egbert granted a number of estates to Christ Church. When Offa reasserted control over Kent, which occurred by 785 at the latest, he confiscated these lands and regranted to some of his thegns.7
Elevation of Lichfield
During J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's term of office, a dispute arose between the see of Canterbury and Offa which led in 787 to the creation of the rival Archdiocese of Lichfield under Hygberht.8 Originally, Offa attempted to bring the southern archbishopric of Canterbury to London, but when the papacy refused permission, Offa secured the creation of a third archbishopric in the British Isles. Lichfield was the main Mercian bishopric, and thus the new archbishopric was under Offa's control.9 There were several reasons for the conflict between J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht and Offa. J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's opposed Offa's deposition of the Kentish dynasty. They conflicted over land which they both claimed as theirs, and J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht refused to crown Offa's son Ecgfrith.10 Problems were also caused by the archbishop minting his own coins at Canterbury.11 Matthew Paris, writing in the thirteenth century, stated that J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht conspired to admit Charlemagne to Canterbury if he invaded Britain. This story may reflect a genuine tradition recorded at St Albans Abbey, where Paris was based, or it may be a fabrication to fill in details of J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's life where Paris had no other information.12 A rumour during J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht's reign also falsely claimed that Offa was plotting with Charlemagne to depose Pope Hadrian I; at least one modern historian, Simon Keynes, believes it possible J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was behind the rumour.13 Offa's eventual successor later admitted to the papacy that Offa's actions had been motivated by hatred of J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht and the Kentish people.14
In 787, Pope Hadrian sent a pallium to Hygberht of Lichfield, elevating Lichfield to an archbishopric, and Ecgfrith was crowned. There is no extant contemporary evidence, however, that J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht ever recognized Hygberht as an archbishop.15{{#tag:ref|The archbishopric at Lichfield was abolished after Offa's death, and was no longer an archdiocese by 803.16|group=notes}} Canterbury retained as suffragans the bishops of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.17
Later life
J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht presided at a council held at London, sometime after the elevation of Lichfield, attended by most of the bishops from southern Britain.18 J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht died on 12 August 792.1920 J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht was buried in the abbey church of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury.2122 J&lt;U+00E6&gt;nberht has since been revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 August.23
