Linimo train approaching Banpaku Kinen Koen, towards Fujigaoka Station
, formally the  is a magnetic levitation train line in Aichi, Japan, near the city of Nagoya. While primarily built to serve the Expo 2005 fair site, the line is still operating to serve the local community.
Linimo is owned and operated by . Linimo claims1 to be the world's first commercial automated &quot;Urban Maglev&quot;, although it was predated by the Birmingham Maglev (1984-1995), the Berlin M-Bahn (1989-1991) and the Shanghai Maglev (2004-).
Specifications
The linear motor magnetic-levitated train has a top speed of , floating  above the track when in motion, and is intended as an alternative to conventional metro systems, not high-speed operation. The line has nine stations and is  long, with a minimum operating radius of  and a maximum gradient of 6%. The trains were designed by the Chubu HSST Development Corporation, which also operates a test track in Nagoya. Construction of the track cost &lt;U+00A5&gt;60 billion (US$575 million) while the Linimo trains themselves, built by Nippon Sharyo, cost &lt;U+00A5&gt;40.5 billion (US$380 million).2 The overall construction cost thus came to roughly $100 million per km.
Technical and financial difficulties
Being the first commercial implementation of a new type of transport system, the line suffered a number of highly publicized technical breakdowns during the Expo, with far higher demand during peak hours than the line's carrying capacity of 4,000 passengers per direction per hour. On March 19, 2005 and again on March 24, the number of people inside the trains exceeded the design capacity of 244 passengers and the train was unable to levitate. The line also has to be shut down for safety reasons when wind speed exceeds 25 m/s, a relatively common occurrence in the area.
During the Expo, the line carried an average of 31,000 passengers per day, but ridership dropped to only 12,000 in the first six months after the Expo, and the line lost over &lt;U+00A5&gt;3 billion in 2006. While ridership gradually increased to 16,500 passengers per day in 2008,3 the line still made a financial loss of &lt;U+00A5&gt;2.1 billion in fiscal year 2009.4

Cancelled plan in Taiwan
In 2006, there was a plan to use the system for Xinyi LRT (&lt;U+4FE1&gt;&lt;U+7FA9&gt;&lt;U+8F15&gt;&lt;U+8ECC&gt;), a proposed line in Xinyi, Taipei, Taiwan.5 The line was later cancelled in 2007.6
