The Potez 220 was a prototype French twin-engined, three-seat Reconnaissance aircraft reconnaissance and army cooperation aircraft. Two examples were built in 1939, but no production followed.
Design and development
On 6 February 1937, the French air ministry issued specification A.24 for a three-seat reconnaissance and army-cooperation aircraft.Green 1967, p. 64. To meet this requirement, the nationalised Socit Nationale de Constructions Aronautiques du Nord SNCAN, formed in January 1937 from ANF Les Mureaux, Potez, Chantiers Aro-Maritimes de la Seine and parts of Breguet Aviation Breguet and Avions Amiot Amiot,Gunston 2005, p. 337. gave the task to the design team inherited from Les Mureaux. Their design, the Potez 220#tag:ref All SNCAN designs, no matter what part of the conglomerate they originated from, were named as Potez aircraft owing to the prestige associated with the name.Breffort and Jouineau 2005, p. 80. group=lower-alpha was a twin-engined monoplane of all metal construction. The fuselage was an oval section monocoque, which accommodated the aircraft's crew of three, consisting of a pilot, a radio operator gunner and an observer, with a glazed gondola slung under the fuselage provided for the observer. It was powered by two convert 700 hp kW disp=flip abbr=on Gnome-Rhne 14M radial engines driving three-bladed propellers, which were fed from fuel tanks located within the wing. A retractable conventional landing gear tailwheel undercarriage was fitted.Green 1967, pp. 6566.Breffort and Jouineau 2005, pp. 8081.
The first prototype made its maiden flight at Sartrouville on 7 April 1939, with the second prototype following on 20 October that year. Performance was slightly better than the Potez 63 Potez 63.11 which had recently entered production in the reconnaissance role, while orders had also been placed for the much more powerful and better performing Bloch 174 and Martin Maryland Martin 167F aircraft to meet the same requirement as the Potez 220. Development of the type was therefore abandoned.Green 1967, pp. 64, 66.
