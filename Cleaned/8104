Characters
Detective Chrys Liszt: The protagonist and playable character of the game. She is Roachy's partner. She regards everyone with suspicion after a hard life on the streets, relying on her street-smarts, grit, and intelligence. Her name is a pun on chrysalis.
Detective Roachy Caruthers: Chrys's partner. Roachy has served on the police department for 30 years, and is one of the veterans of the department. He's been shot 47 times in the line of duty.
Chief Chigger: He's described as the typical screaming, over the top, always-upset police chief, but with a few more limbs to wave around. He has been on the force longer than anyone can remember, and got Roachy to recruit new officers.
