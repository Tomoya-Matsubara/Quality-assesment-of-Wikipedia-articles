For a complete overview of all Commodore models see Holden Commodore.
The Holden VE Commodore is the fourteenth and current model of the Holden Commodore, a full-size car produced by Holden, the Australian subsidiary of General Motors.
The car was officially presented at a media launch in Melbourne on July 16 2006, which was broadcasted live on the internet.1 With a sales debut on August 14 2006, it is the first Commodore to be entirely designed and engineered in Australia.2 All previous generations from the original VB Commodore had been based on European sourced platforms from Opel that had been adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market.
The engines and transmissions of the VE are mainly carry-overs from the previous VZ model, except for a new six-speed automatic transmission offered on selected trim levels.3
Holden released the VE Commodore to the New Zealand market in September 2006.4 This was followed by the achievement of the prestigious Wheels Car of the Year award on January 23 2007.5 Before the release of the VE model, Holden confirmed that station wagon and utility body styles of the VE would not be launched for some time. Holden will instead manufacture two parallel generations of Commodores until the VE variants are released.6
History of development
Holden's designers and engineers began laying down the basics of a clean-sheet Commodore in 1999. In the seven years of development, the car came to be Holden's largest and most costly project representing an expenditure exceeding AU$1 billion and 3.4 million kilometres (2.1 million mi) of testing.78
Design
In 1999, Holden's manager of exterior design, Peter Hughes produced a two-dimensional image of a sketch drawn earlier by Michael Simcoe, Holden's design director at the time. Known in house as the &quot;Bill of Design&quot;, the sketch formed the design basis for the production ready car. Various elements of the sketch were changed, including the rear tail lamps, the low-profile side window cluster and the drawn out wheelbase, but the aggressive stance remained.9
Several safety initiatives were implemented in the design of the new Commodore. One of these being the fuel tank that would be located ahead of the rear-axle line, instead of behind.10 A more crash-resistant rear-end structure was seen necessary. The design though would have to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest sized wheel to be fitted to the car. 
In 2004, just two years prior to the release of the VE Commodore, the Torana TT36 concept car was unveiled at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and gauge public reaction to the styling. Much of the Torana&lt;U+2019&gt;s fundamental styling draws from the VE design essence, including some production ready components carrying over from the TT36. Such components include the steering wheel, window and rear-view mirror switch cluster, and handbrake lever.11
Engineering
Shortly after the first design sketches were penned, Holden engineers began work on chassis development. These initial stages of development saw Holden face a dilemma. Opel, the company which had provided the basis for all previous Commodore generations had ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega, therefore leaving Holden with the decision of either developing an all-new vehicle, or using another platform sourced from within General Motors.12 At the time, GM was readying its new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform, to later make a debut in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform but ultimately decided it was not what they were after.13 The Sigma platform&lt;U+2019&gt;s double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium was too costly for a car that was to be sold for around AU$35,000. The luggage compartment was deemed too small, and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car, particularly the rear-seat shoulder width being too tight.
 These major drawbacks made the decision to develop an all new platform essential, which became known as the GM Zeta platform.14 A number of forthcoming General Motors vehicles will employ the platform, which has already replaced the GM V-body and will eventually replace the front-wheel drive W-body, K-Body and G-body platforms after 2010.
Another contentious issue was engine packaging: Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well behind the front axle to create short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance. However, the crash engineers were concerned that this would limit the room needed to absorb impact energy in the event of an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving of some of the engine components &lt;U+2014&gt; such as the battery &lt;U+2014&gt; into the boot, thus freeing up valuable front-end space. While not achieving the design department's original targets, the new compromise retained much of the sporting profile while meeting crash standards.15 By moving the engine back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling.16
The Alloytec V6 engine introduced in the VZ Commodore was originally intended to be first fitted to the VE. However, Holden was concerned that introducing a new platform and drivetrain at the same time would be a risky proposition. As a result, the Alloytec V6 was first introduced in the proven VZ model and allowing Holden to address any issues or faults before fitting it to the VE. The decision proved prudent and a refined version of the engine was introduced for the new platform, featuring some updated components as well as giving five&lt;U+2013&gt;seven kilowatts (7&lt;U+2013&gt;9 hp) more power.17
Innovations
Denny Mooney was appointed chairman of Holden in September 2003. At this stage, development was well under way. Key design and engineering work was being finalised, and money being spent on cutting the tooling used to manufacture the car. One of Mooney's foremost endeavours was to improve the perceived quality issues that surrounded the previous generations of Commodores. The interior quality benefited dramatically from this additional emphasis; Mooney pushed for panel gaps to be reduced by a further 0.5 millimetres (0.02 in) over previous targets.1819 Smaller panel gaps are just one of the ways that Holden have developed the VE to pitch it against the European competitors. Through the use of advanced steels and intensive design, the body structure is 50% stiffer than the outgoing model, benefiting from noise and vibration reductions, handling and crash safety.20 However the new body has resulted in substantially increased weight over the outgoing model.21 
The development of the new car led Holden to redesign the Elizabeth plant in South Australia so that entire sections of the car can be assembled off the foremost production line. This new production method allows for complete sub-sections like the engine and transmissions to be constructed seamlessly together on rigs that simplify production. This process is applied to the front-end module of the VE Commodore, consisting of the headlights, bumpers, airbag sensors and other accessory components. It can be easily removed as one-piece leading to lower repair costs and easier access to the engine bay.22 This design represents the first time such a method has been used within General Motors, and garnered the SAE Australasia's 2006 Automotive Engineering Excellence Award.23 A modular design structure known within Holden as &quot;flex strategy&quot; has been applied to the interior where fundamentally different components such as audio units and instrument clusters can be swapped out for the different Commodore variants, creating radically varied interior look and feel without much higher costs.24 The upshot of this is much greater differentiation between the variants than the outgoing model creating three distinct interior looks, dubbed Functional, Performance and Luxury.
Additional detail touches were added to the VE, such as a new four-strut hinge system for the boot (as used on upmarket European models) to replace space intrusive, much maligned &quot;gooseneck&quot; hinges as used on previous Commodores.25 High-specification variants see expandable door pockets and a Saab-like &quot;blackout&quot; feature which illuminates only the speedometer at night to enhance driver focus on the road.26 An innovative flush-fitting handbrake set into a symmetrical centre console means the lever can be easily reversed to sit on the opposite side of console for left-hand drive export markets, minimising redesign costs.27
Another first for the Commodore are the V-Series variants for selected models, providing a fully optioned version of the respective specification level. This was largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range known as the SSZ being rather successful.28 Before the VE, the SS badge was a well-known flagship name, and the SV8 model was a lower-spec version of the SS. For the VE, Holden essentially rebadged the SV8 as the SS, and used the new SS V name to replace the old SS specification level.
Engine and mechanicals
 Six-cylinder variants receive a revised version of the Australian-built Alloytec V6 engine. Power has increased over the VZ Commodore and engine noise reduced by using new timing chains, among other modifications. Fuel economy figures for variants utilizing the 180 kilowatt (241 hp) V6 show a small reduction in consumption over the previous Alloytec engines, bringing it into line with its then current rival, the Ford BF Falcon at 10.9 L/100 km (21.6 mpg U.S.). Fuel consumption results for other variants are mixed when compared to VZ models, due primarily to increased weight.29
An updated version of the long-serving four-speed automatic transmission remains for the 180 kilowatt (241 hp) V6. A modified version of the L76 V8 engine is also carried-over, producing an extra 10 kilowatts (13 hp) of power. This new engine, designated (L98) does not readily support fuel-saving Displacement on Demand technology, unlike the L76.30
In October 2006, Holden introduced a dual-fuel version of the Alloytec V6, able to run on both petrol and LPG. Featuring an advanced Sequential Vapour Gas Injection (SVGI) system and hardened valve seats to cope, the new V6 produces five kilowatts (7 hp) and five newton metres (5 ft&lt;U+00B7&gt;lbf) less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, for a total of 175 kilowatts (235 hp).31 Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large 100 kilogram (220 lb) cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption.
Holden was able to take advantage of a small loophole in government legislation, allowing an AU$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a AU$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG.32 The dual-fuel option is available on the Commodore Omega, Berlina and the soon to be discontinued VZ Executive station wagon.33
Transmission options comprise of the Aisin AY6 and Tremec T-56 six-speed manuals, the four-speed automatic GM 4L60E, and the five-speed automatic GM 5L40E. The GM 6L80E six-speed automatic transmission is offered on variants sporting the 6.0 litre V8 engine. Both the five and six-speed automatics feature Active Select controls allowing manual gear selection. Having undergone significant revisions, the T-56 gains extra synchromesh, shorter clutch action and a more tightly-spaced M10 gearset shared with the Chevrolet SSR.34
New double-pivot MacPherson strut front suspension and a four-link independent rear suspension have been introduced to replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension for dramatically improved ride and handling.35

Specification levels
Commodore Omega
Replacing the outgoing Commodore Executive and Acclaim, the Omega offers a halfway point in terms of equipment levels. The most significant gain over the Executive is the Bosch Electronic Stability Program (ESP) 8.0 system, now standard across the range.39 Again like all VE models, the Omega uses a spacesaver spare tyre. A full-sized, matching 16 inch (400 mm) spare tyre is available as an optional extra.40
Commodore SV6
Building on the Omega, the SV6 is equipped with a more powerful 195 kilowatt variant of the Alloytec V6, coupled to an Aisin six-speed manual transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the Omega, comes standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black center console and red lighting, as opposed to the silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.41
Commodore SS
 Offering similar equipment levels to the SV6, the Commodore SS uses the 6.0 litre V8 engine and T-56 six-speed manual transmission. The SS is recognisable from its quad exhaust outlets in place of the SV6 dual outlets. The resulting specification level is much higher than the outgoing minimalist SV8 and only missing a few cosmetic touches of the previous flagship Commodore SS.42
Commodore SS V-Series
Sitting at the top of hierarchy in the sports sector, the SS V-Series represents the first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of the General Motors family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features.43
Based on the Commodore SS variant, the SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the old SS. Inside, the SS V is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black.44 The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19 inch (480 mm) alloy wheels and the option of larger 20 inch (500 mm) wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.45
Berlina
 Priced lower than the outgoing model, the second tier Berlina retains a similar amount of equipment. The exterior styling is similar to the Omega but gaining extra touches such as front fog lamps and seven-spoke 17 inch (430 mm) alloy wheels. It features the Luxury-type interior with a large LCD centre display and is the only model in the VE range that uses wood grain highlights.46
Calais
Like the Berlina, the Calais retains the features of the outgoing model but at a significantly lower price point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the 195 kilowatt V6 of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension.47
Calais V-Series
Based on the Calais, the V-Series edition shares Luxury-style interior of the Berlina and Calais, but adds real aluminium highlights. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range.48
Market
 At the time of launch in Australia, Ford&lt;U+2019&gt;s BF Falcon directly competed with the VE Commodore. Ford has since revised its Falcon line-up, and in November 2006 Toyota released their key Aurion model to the Australian market.49 The Mitsubishi 380 may also indirectly compete with the Holden Commodore.50
Market for the VE Commodore extends further than Australia. Designed with export markets in mind, VE Commodores are sold in New Zealand, the Middle East and South Africa. For the latter two markets, they are rebadged as the Chevrolet Lumina and marketed alongside the WM Statesman/Caprice-based Chevrolet Caprice.51 Shanghai GM announced that a WM Statesman derived Buick Park Avenue will be manufactured for the Chinese market, utilizing Australian-built versions of the GM High Feature engine. The Park Avenue replaces the Buick Royaum; a rebadged version of the WL Statesman.52 This announcement came only days after a multi-million dollar deal was made to market the WM Caprice in South Korea as the Daewoo L4X.53
GM and Holden confirmed V6 and V8 versions of the Commodore will be exported to the United States as the 2008 Pontiac G8 to replace the ageing Pontiac Grand Prix, in a deal to last the life cycle of the car.5455 This announcement coincided with a Pontiac unveiling at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. VE Commodores have also been sampled by Opel in Germany, while Opel's equivalent in the United Kingdom, Vauxhall has expressed interest in importing HSV modified versions, announcing their plans to sell the HSV Clubsport R8 as the 2007 Vauxhall VXR8.56
Issues and criticism
The fitment of a space-saver tyre to all models across the range has come under heavy criticism, as Holden is the first manufacturer to fit a temporary spare tyre to an Australian-built car. The tyre can be driven for 500 kilometres (300 mi) at a maximum speed of 80 kilometres per hour (50 mph). Concerns have been raised by the public over its usefulness in remote Australian outback areas, far from any tyre repair centres and asserts that it is a cost-cutting measure.57 Similar concerns have been raised in the media, although Holden maintains that this is a weight-saving feature and allows for full-size spare tyres to be purchased at an additional cost.5859
On the base Omega model, air conditioning is an extra-cost option. Critics have seen this as unforgivable considering Australia is a country well known for its overall hot climate and especially since its Falcon and Aurion rivals have it as standard.60
Concerns have also been levelled at VE fuel consumption figures, where the heavier body has negatively impacted and produced mixed official fuel economy results, particularly for V8 variants.61 Arch-rival Ford has taken advantage of this to criticise the Commodore, as its latest Ford BFII Falcon update brings improved fuel consumption figures of 10.7 L/100 km (22.0 mpg U.S.) for the base XT model and 10.2 L/100 km (23.1 mpg U.S.) with an optional six-speed automatic.6263 Real-world testing have confirmed the difference in fuel consumption.6465
The introduction of the new model has resulted in a few embarrassing &quot;teething&quot; issues. The Commodore has been recalled twice since its release. The initial October 16 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore, Statesman and Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin.66 A second November 10 2006 recall affecting 12,830 early-build Commodores, Statesmans and Caprices resulted from defective rear seatbelt anchors.67
