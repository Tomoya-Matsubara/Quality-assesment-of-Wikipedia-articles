Tropical Storm Debby caused extensive flooding in North Florida and the Florida Panhandle. The fourth tropical cyclone and named storm of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a trough of low pressure in the central Gulf of Mexico on June 23 Despite a projected track toward landfall in Louisiana or Texas, the storm headed the opposite direction, moving slowly north-northeast or northeastward. The storm steadily strengthened, and at 1800 UTC on June 25, Debby attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Dry air, westerly wind shear, and upwelling prevented further intensification. Instead, Debby weakened, and by late on June 26, it was a minimal tropical storm. At 2100 UTC, the storm made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Debby continued to weaken while crossing Florida, and dissipated shortly after emerging into the Atlantic on June 27.
The storm dropped immense amounts of precipitation near its path. Rainfall peaked at  in Curtis Mill, Florida, located in southwestern Wakulla County. The Sopchoppy River, which reached its record height, flooded at least 400 structures in Wakulla County. Additionally, the Suwannee River reached its highest level since Hurricane Dora in 1964. Further south in Pasco County, the Anclote River and Pithlachascotee River overflowed, flooding communities with &quot;head deep&quot; water and causing damage to 106 homes. An additional 587 homes were inundated after the Black Creek overflowed in Clay County. Several roads and highways in North Florida were left impassable, including Interstate 10 and U.S. Route 90. U.S. Routes 19 and 98 were also inundated by coastal flooding. In Central and South Florida, damage was primarily caused by tornadoes, one of which caused a fatality. Overall, Debby at least $210 million in losses and 10 deaths, 8 in Florida and 1 each in Alabama and South Carolina.
Meteorological history
The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrated northward into the southern Gulf of Mexico in mid-June. Coinciding with a Madden&lt;U+2013&gt;Julian oscillation, a weak surface low pressure area developed on June 19, and subsequently moved inland over the Yucat&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Peninsula. While the system crossed the peninsula, a tropical wave moved through the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 18. The wave reached the Gulf of Mexico on June 20 and merged with the low a few days later, spawning a trough of low pressure on June 22. Located in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, moderate vertical wind shear caused the system to remain disorganized. Nonetheless, Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the trough acquired a low-level circulation on June 23, while ships in the area reported tropical storm force winds. Thus, it is estimated that Tropical Storm Debby developed at 1200 UTC on June 23, centered about  south of mouth of the Mississippi River.1
Becoming a tropical storm on June 23, Debby became the earliest fourth named storm in the Atlantic basin, surpassing the old record set by Hurricane Dennis on July 5, 2005. Initially, Debby was predicted to curve westward and potentially threaten Texas.2 A deepening trough would curve the storm westward, while wind shear was predicted to decrease.3 Although the storm generated very cold cloud tops, much of the convection was located more than  from the center and still displaced to the east.4 By 1200 UTC on June 24, the forecast path was shifted from east-central Texas to southeastern Louisiana.5 Despite persistent wind shear, Debby was strengthening and around that time, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 65 mph (100 km/h).6 Later on June 24, the National Hurricane Center noted in its next advisory that this &quot;is a very difficult and highly uncertain forecast&quot;, citing Debby's slow movement and widespread computer forecast models.7  The forecast track for Debby was shifted significantly to the east late on June 24, and it was predicted that the storm would move northward and make landfall near Panama City, Florida.8 Based on a dropsonde estimate, Debby attained its minimum barometric pressure of  at 0000 UTC on June 25. However, the storm began to weaken due to increasing wind shear, drier air, and upwelling, caused by Debby's slow movement.9 It was initially composed of multiple small swirls, but consolidated into one well-defined low-level circulation by early on June 25.10 Due to its excessively slow movement and no prediction for acceleration, the National Hurricane Center remarked that, &quot;the cyclone does not seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.&quot;11 A burst in deep convection occurred later on June 25, though adverse environmental conditions prevented re-intensification. Debby began curving east-northeastward and began to speed up on June 26, in response to a mid-latitude trough digging into the western Atlantic Ocean. While approaching the Florida Big Bend, Debby produced only a small area of deep convection on satellite imagery.12
At 2100 UTC June 26, Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm weakened quickly after moving inland, and by early on June 27, it was downgraded to a tropical depression, while located about  north of Gainesville, Florida. Debby maintained tropical cyclone status while crossing Florida, but degenerated into a trough of low pressure by 1800 UTC on June 27.13 In the final advisory issued by the National Hurricane Center three hours later, the agency noted that Debby could eventually reacquire tropical characteristics.14 After its dissipation, however, the remnants did not regenerate into a tropical cyclone, but re-developed a new center of circulation and strengthened slightly due to baroclinic conditions. As it accelerated northward, Debby's remnants became increasingly frontal in nature, and once again degenerated into an open trough at 1800 UTC on June 30; at this time, the disturbance was located south of Newfoundland.15
Preparations
Upon development of Debby on June 23, a tropical storm warning was issued from the mouth of the Pearl River to Morgan City, Louisiana, excluding New Orleans or Lake Pontchartrain. On the following day, a separate tropical storm warning was put into effect from the Mississippi and Alabama border to the mouth of the Ochlockonee River in Florida. At 1500 UTC on June 24, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of the Suwannee River. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to Anclote Key. These were all canceled at 1500 UTC on June 25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from Destin to Englewood, Florida. Early on June 26, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mexico Beach to Englewood, Florida. By 2100 UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of Steinhatchee River in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.16 In addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches, voluntary evacuations were issued for several areas in northwest Florida during the approach of the storm; a mandatory evacuation was issued for St. George Island.17
Impact
 Throughout the Southeastern United States, nine people were killed in relation to Tropical Storm Debby. Of these, seven took place in Florida and one each in Alabama and South Carolina.18 Throughout Central and South Florida, the outerbands of the storm spawned 13 tornadoes: five in Collier County, two in Glades County, one in Hardee County, two in Highlands County, one in Miami-Dade County, and two in Palm Beach County.
Florida
North Florida and Panhandle
The outerbands of Debby produced locally heavy rainfall across much of Florida. Gainesville picked up its second-highest daily rain total of 6.95 inches on June 24. In Tallahassee, more than  of rain fell in four hours.19 In Apalachicola, a gust of  was observed as well as a record daily rainfall of  on June 24.2021 Throughout June 25, an intense complex of thunderstorms developed to the north of Debby's center and produced torrential rains over the Florida Panhandle for much of the day. Many areas received rainfall in excess of , resulting in widespread flash flooding. Just outside of Curtis Mill in Wakulla County, a resident measured a storm total rainfall of . In Panacea, a Mesonet station recorded a 24 hour rainfall of . Due to the flooding, several civil emergency messages were sent out to the public throughout North Florida.22 Across Wakulla County, at least 42 homes were destroyed and 476 others were affected in some by the storm. Losses throughout the county were assessed at $9.09 million.23 In Columbia County, preliminary losses were placed in excess of $20 million as of July 3 and did not take into account hundreds of homes that remained flooded at the time.24 Several bridges were washed out due to the heavy rain; both U.S. Route 319 and U.S. Route 98 were closed due to flooding.25
The John Gorrie Memorial Bridge (US 98/US 319) connecting Apalachicola to Eastpoint was closed on June 24 due to high winds.26 About  south of the island, a Coastal-Marine Automated Network station recorded a peak wind gust of .27 The St. George Island Bridge (State Road 300), a  bridge connecting Eastpoint to St. George Island over the Apalachicola Bay, was also closed on June 24 due to high winds.28 The bridge was opened later that day as both St. George Island and Alligator Point were put under a mandatory evacuation, requiring all people to leave immediately, and those remaining on the islands subject to arrest.2930 St. George Island, a popular resort community and tourist destination, lost all power on June 24 due to high winds destroying three power poles in the Apalachicola Bay; a Progress Energy spokesperson stated that it could be days before power was restored because the conditions are too unsafe for workers.31
Central and South Florida
 Along the Anclote and Pithlachascotee Rivers in Pasco County, emergency managers ordered mandatory evacuations for 14,000–20,000 people as the rivers rose dramatically. The Anclote River rose from  to , well above major flood stage, leaving surrounding areas in &quot;head-deep&quot; water. At least 106 homes in the county have been damaged by flood waters so far.32 Throughout the county, damage to private property was $1.5 million (2012 USD), while public property losses were estimated at $26 million (2012 USD).33
In St. Petersburg, a gust of  was observed, while  of rain fell in a one-hour period.34 With the substantial loss of beaches, tourism in the region is expected to suffer significantly.35 Portions of Upham Beach in Pinellas County were completely eroded up to the seawall and other areas in that county had lost  of sand. On Treasure Island, coastal dunes were eroded by . In Pass-a-Grille, Debby's storm surge flooded coastal hotels with ankle-deep water as the dunes were washed away.36 Throughout St. Pete Beach, 30–40 homes were damaged by a tornado spawned by Debby. Losses throughout the city were estimated at $1.5 million.37 In Hillsborough County, several street signs were severely bent and damaged in Tampa. Also, localized flooding occurred throughout Tampa's neighborhoods including: Bayshore, Davis Islands, Interbay, Macdill, and West Shore. Power outages were also reported in Tampa.
A man drowned near Lake Dorr in Lake County after his canoe capsized along a river in Ocala National Forest.38 In Polk County, a woman died after her car hydroplaned on a flooded road. Another person drowned on a river in the after his canoe capsized; however, it is unknown whether or not his death was attributable to Debby.39 Throughout Polk County, 115 homes were damaged by the storm, mainly as a result of tornadoes, and losses were estimated at $5 million.40 The lone tornado in Hardee County felled several trees and damaged a tractor and barn. In Glades County, one tornado caused minor roof damage to a barn in Muce, while the other resulted in no effects. In Highlands County, four homes were destroyed and twenty-four more were damaged to varying degrees by two tornadoes. Losses in the county reached approximately $1.4 million. Several homes were damaged by the two twisters in Highlands County, with one resulting in a fatality near Venus.  The first tornado in Collier County caused minor roof damage to a few structures near Naples on June 23. A second tornado in the county later that day broke light poles and snapped tree limbs in North Naples, with one person being injured by a falling branch. Three others twisters were spawned in Collier County on June 24, though damage was no more than a few downed trees.41 On Anna Maria Island in Manatee County, water reached the retention walls of several condos, some of which were undermined, allowing water to enter beach-side pools. The most significant losses were on the south side of the island where up to half of the dunes were lost.42 In Sarasota County, they had declared a State of Emergency because of storm surge and widespread flooding elsewhere. They had 4 inches of rain in Sarasota. A State of Emergency was declared on account of storm surge and widespread flooding elsewhere;  of rain fell at the Sarasota airport.
At the Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, of precipitation fell in only one hour.43 Further south in Pompano Beach,  of rain was reported in a 24-hour period.44 A tornado in Palm Beach County damaged a few houses and some vegetation in Lake Worth. The other twister in Palm Beach County snapped some trees, blew a gate across a street, and broke a railroad crossing arm. A waterspout offshore Miami-Dade County moved inland near Golden Beach and twisted three gates and blew open a garage door.45
Elsewhere
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, nine oil production platforms and one drilling rig were damaged. Overall, United States oil production decreased by 2%.46 On June 25, 44% of the daily oil and 33% of the daily natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico was shut down. The following day, companies began returning employees to platforms and production was rapidly restored.47 A man in Orange Beach, Alabama drowned after being swept away by heavy surf.48 Off the coast of South Carolina, one person went missing and is presumed dead after rescuers failed to find him after several days.49 Heavy rainfall from Debby extended northward into southern Georgia, peaking at  in Fargo.50 Localized and isolated flooding occurred in nearby Lowndes County, with up to  of water in the parking lot at a Sonny's restaurant in Lake Park.51 The remnants of Debby passed about  north of Bermuda on June 29 and produced tropical storm force winds on the island, but caused no damage.52
