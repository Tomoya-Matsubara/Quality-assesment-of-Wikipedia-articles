Garnet Francis Malley, MC, AFC (2 November 1892 &lt;U+2013&gt; 20 May 1961) was an Australian fighter ace of World War I, credited with six aerial victories. He was an aviation adviser to Chiang Kai-shek's government in China during the 1930s, and an intelligence officer in World War II.
Born and educated in New South Wales, Malley first saw service in World War I as an artilleryman with the Australian Imperial Force. He transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in 1917, and the following year flew Sopwith Camels with No. 4 Squadron on the Western Front. Malley was awarded the Military Cross for his achievements in combat, and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the Air Force Cross. After a spell in civilian life following the war, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1925, serving with No. 3 Squadron. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and worked closely with Madame Chiang Kai-shek from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the Sino-Japanese War at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.
Early life
Garnet Malley was the penultimate of six children born to Clara Ellen Merritt and Francis Malley in Mosman, a suburb of Sydney, on 2 November 1892. He attended the Church of England Preparatory School in Mosman, The School in Mount Victoria, and Hawkesbury Agricultural College in Richmond. At the outbreak of World War I he was apprenticing as a mechanic in his father's whitegoods firm, Malley's Ltd, in Sydney.12
World War I
Malley joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 12 October 1915.34 He departed Melbourne for Egypt as a gunner with reinforcements of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade aboard HMAT Wandilla on 9 November.5 In March 1916, he was posted to the Western Front in France, and joined his unit in May.6 The 1st Brigade took part in the Battles of Pozi&lt;U+00E8&gt;res and Mouquet Farm in July and August 1916.78 Malley transferred to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as a mechanic in April 1917, before undertaking flying instruction at the Oxford University air school. He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 9 October and assigned to No. 4 Squadron AFC, then based in Birmingham.9
Equipped with Sopwith Camel fighters, No. 4 Squadron deployed to Bruay, France, in December 1917, and commenced operations on 9 January 1918.10 Nicknamed &quot;Garnie&quot; (or &quot;George&quot;, by No. 4 Squadron's leading ace, Harry Cobby), Malley was promoted lieutenant the same day.1112 On 16 March, he achieved his first aerial victory, sending an Albatros fighter belonging to Manfred von Richthofen's Red Circus out of control near Douai.131415 Malley was promoted captain and appointed a flight commander on 26 March.1617 By 1 June, he had destroyed three more German fighters, an observation balloon, and an unidentified observation plane.18 Twice wounded in action, he was awarded the Military Cross on 22 June.1920 Promulgated in The London Gazette, the citation read:21 
In August 1918, Malley was posted to No. 5 (Training) Squadron AFC at Minchinhampton, England.22 His rotation to home establishment was in accordance with Royal Air Force policy requiring pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat.23 Known for flying a white Camel trainer, he received the Air Force Cross for his instructional work; the award was promulgated on 3 June 1919.2425

He was discharged from the AIF on 4 October, and rejoined the family firm as warehouse manager in 1921. On 25 January 1922, he married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman.26 The union would produce one son, Maldon.27 Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter's volume on the Australian Flying Corps that was first published in 1923 as part of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914&lt;U+2013&gt;1918.28
On 19 June 1925, Malley was commissioned as a flight lieutenant in the part-time Citizen Air Force, serving as a pilot with No. 3 Squadron, which operated Airco DH.9s and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. Formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, the squadron transferred to the newly opened RAAF Richmond, New South Wales, on 30 June.2930 From 1925 to 1928, Malley was vice president of the Australian Flying Corps Association. In January 1928, he was promoted to honorary squadron leader, and temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron in March&lt;U+2013&gt;April.3132 That year, he gave up his position with Malley's Ltd to become an aviation consultant to Australian National Airways (ANA), as well as a director of the company.3334 In January&lt;U+2013&gt;February 1929, he again temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron.35 That April, he was a member of the citizens' committee responsible for organising and funding the search for the missing Southern Cross and its crew.36 The following year, he transferred to the RAAF Reserve.37
By 1931, ANA was in financial difficulties and Malley travelled to China to take up a position as an aviation adviser to the Chinese government in Kwangtung.38 On 1 February 1937, through the influence of the British Foreign Office, Malley's status was bolstered by his appointment as an honorary wing commander in the RAAF Reserve. He was by this time serving as adviser to Madame Chiang Kai-shek in her capacity as secretary-general of the aeronautical commission that directed China's air force; Madame Chiang extended to Malley her &quot;warmest congratulations&quot; for his &quot;well deserved&quot; promotion.39 One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the air force.40 Malley's stay increasingly involved him in the fighting in China; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940.41 Some members of the RAAF, however, including the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Williams, may have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role with the Chinese, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. At any rate, his reports of Japanese air tactics during 1938, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.4243
World War II and after
Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940.44 He rejoined the RAAF as a squadron leader in October, and took up the position of Deputy Director of the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre (COIC).45 Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident in the wake of the attack on Darwin in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented.4647 He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded Rupert Long as Director of COIC.48 Malley was raised to acting group captain on 1 July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3 October.4950 He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9 June 1943.5152 General Douglas MacArthur praised Malley for his &quot;foresight, planning, and organizational ability&quot;.53 He went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the Commonwealth Security Service in Canberra from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain.5455
In 1948, Malley's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the Legion of Merit. By 1949, he had procured a yacht, the Royal Flight, which was used as a setting in the film The Blue Lagoon.56 The following year, the family bought a coconut plantation on Vanua Balavu, Fiji.57 In September 1951, Malley and his wife toured the world, visiting Algiers, Guadaloupe, Cura&lt;U+00E7&gt;ao, Martinique, and Tahiti.58 They subsequently returned to live on their Fijian plantation, and rode out the 1953 Suva earthquake and tidal wave.59
Garnet Malley died of a heart attack on 20 May 1961. Survived by his wife and son, he was buried at sea in an Anglican ceremony.60 The commander-in-chief of the Taiwanese air force sent condolences, paying tribute to the &quot;invaluable&quot; contribution Malley had made during his decade in China, which would &quot;be long remembered&quot;.61
