East Technical High School or East Tech is a secondary school under the operation of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in Cleveland, Ohio. The school when it opened on October 5, 1908 was the first public trade school in the city and reported to be only one of five in the entire United States at the time. East Tech's first principal was James F. Barker (1906-1911) from Muskegon, Michigan.
The school was a sports powerhouse in the city, winning numerous titles in football, basketball and track and field. Some notable alumni include Olympic Games athletic stars such as Jesse Owens, Harrison Dillard and Dave Albritton. The original building stood for some 64 years until a new building was dedicated and moved into on October 11, 1972. The current structure now sits at the corner of E.55th and Scovill Ave on the east side of Cleveland. The original building has since been demolished.
