No. 410 Squadron RCAF, the &quot;Cougars&quot;, is a Canadian Forces Air Command aircraft squadron currently located at Canada's primary CF-18 training base, Cold Lake, Alberta. The squadron was formed during the Second World War as a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron, but was originally under the Royal Air Force. The first official sortie occurred on 23 July 1941 when Pilot Officer Lucas was flying his Defiant V1183. During the Second World War it was credited as being the top night fighter squadron in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force (TAF) during the period between D-Day and VE-Day.
During the Second World War No. 410 Squadron RCAF flew in major operations such as the Normandy Landings and the Battle of the Bulge. Between these two battles the squadron flew nightly patrols and many members gained ace status. Two members of 410, Flight Lieutenant (F/L) Currie and Flight Officer (F/O) Rose, were the first members of the RCAF to see the German V-2 Rocket Bomb in flight, later that same rocket bomb landed on the British coast.
The squadron was also disbanded in 1964 but was reformed in 1968 and remains active. The squadron trains the most people a year on the CF-18 as 410 Tactical Fighter (Operational Training) Squadron. The TV show Jetstream was filmed with the squadron and showed life on the base and what pilots must endure to become fighter pilots.
Formation and badge
No. 410 Squadron was formed at RAF Ayr in June 1941 as a Royal Canadian Air Force &quot;Article XV squadron&quot;, under Royal Air Force operational control, the third night fighter squadron in the RCAF. At the time it was equipped with the Boulton Paul Defiant. In May 1942 these were removed from service to have the Bristol Beaufighters be introduced, and in October of the same year these were replaced with De Havilland Mosquito Mk II's, with which the first victory for the squadron was claimed. No. 410 was at the time noted as being the top-scoring night-fighter unit in RAF Second Tactical Air Force in the period between D-Day and VE Day,1 although there are other claims that the top-scoring night-fighter unit is really No. 409 Squadron RCAF, on the basis that there were many victories quickly counted up during 1943.2
The No. 410 Squadron badge depicts a cougar's face with a background decrescent (waning moon). The cougar, a North American mammal, was chosen because of its speed and power in its attacks. The waning moon refers to the squadron's night operations.3 The two major devices are in reference to the Second World War fighter days, where the squadron was a night fighting unit that was known for its skill and score. The squadron's motto is Noctivaga, which means &quot;wandering by night&quot;.4

Bases
No. 410 Squadron RCAF began its career in the Second World War at RAF Ayr, which was located at Ayrshire. From there it was moved to RAF Drem, located at East Lothian, but was returned to RAF Ayr 10 months later. On 1 September 1942 the Cougars were again moved, this time to RAF Scorton, in Yorkshire, but just under two months later was relocated to RAF Acklington. Although the Squadron moved three times in 1942, it was relocated four times in 1943 and later, five times in 1944.5 In 1943 they were placed at RAF Coleby Grange, but this would not be the first time. For the sixth time the Squadron was moved, this time to RAF West Malling, but being re-equipped with Mosquito VI from the former Mosquito II. 8 November 1943 the Squadron was placed at RAF Hunsdon, the first of three times at RAF Hundson, but a mere month later it was moved to RAF Castle Camps. Only four months later, and four months into 1944, were the Cougars relocated back to RAF Hundson, this for the second time.6 On 18 June 1944, they were placed at RAF Zeals, only to be moved again in one month and ten days to RAF Colerne, in Wiltshire. On 9 September 1944 No. 410 Squadron RCAF was again, this for the third and final time, moved to RAF Hunsdon. 13 days later, the squadron was relocated back to their sixth base, RAF Coleby Grange.7 On 3 November 1944 the Squadron moved to RAF Amiens-Glisy, for the first of two times. Only two months later the squadron was relocated to RAF Lille-Vendeville, the first movement of the squadron in 1945.8 As of 5 April 1945 the Cougars were located at RAF Amiens-Glisy, the second deployment to that area. The final movement of the war occurred on 9 June 1945, when the squadron moved to RAF Gilze-Rijen.9
Operations
On 23 July 1941, Pilot Officer (P/O) Lucas flew his Defiant V1183 from Ayr for the first official operation of the war for No. 410 Squadron RCAF. The first enemy contact, however, occurred on 6/7 September 1942, when a Beaufighter II from RAF Scorton flown by P/O R.R. Ferguson and P/O D. Creed (navigator), intercepted a Luftwaffe Ju88. The Beaufighter was vectored to the Ju88 approximately 20 miles north east of Whitby. The attack damaged the Ju88.10 Since they did not manage to destroy the aircraft, this not count as the squadron's first outright victory. That came on 22 January 1943, when Flight Sergeant B.M. Haight and Sergeant T. Kipling (RAF, observer), flying a Mosquito II from Acklington, were credited with a Do 217, which was destroyed near Hartlepool.11 This occurred because of &quot;night readiness&quot;, the ability to fly at a moment's notice at night. By the end of the war a total of 75&lt;U+00BE&gt; victories had been claimed.12 The squadron flew 2,972 sorties and accumulated 28,150 hours of flight time. The squadron's victories included 75&lt;U+00BE&gt; destroyed, 2 probably destroyed, and 9 damaged. The squadron had the following casualties: operational: 17 aircraft and 32 aircrew, of whom 10 were killed, 20 presumed dead, and two were made prisoners of war. Non-operational: 14 aircraft and 30 personnel, of whom 29 were killed, 1 injured.13
D-Day and the invasion of Europe
Between November 1943 and May 1944, the squadron was engaged in the night defence of Britain. On 5 June 1944, No. 410 Squadron's CO, Wing Commander G.A. Hiltz, flew a four-aircraft detachment to Colerne where they provided fighter cover for the initial airborne landings. Among the pilots who flew that operation was Flight Lieutenant Charles Emanuel &quot;Pop&quot; Edinger, who would later become a ace. On the night prior to the 6 June 1944 invasion (D-Day), all of the TAF's night fighter squadrons were working late to ensure safety for the landing force. During June 1944, 18 of the 22 fighters were available for the flight. At 01:00 the first of four patrols took off, but the patrol was uneventful, with the pilots reporting clouds at 10,000 feet.14 A further five patrols were flown to help cover the 4,000 ships that were part of Operation Neptune. On 7 June two of the aircraft were fired upon by friendly Lancaster Bombers, who assumed they were hostile. However No. 410 Squadron claimed its first kill, when Flying Officers A. Mcleod and Bob Snowdon destroyed a Junkers Ju188. On 12 June the squadron claimed multiple bomber kills.15 The &quot;little blitz&quot; was moving in full on England. The Cougars shot down 14 raiders with five more probably destroyed or damaged. But the success was overshadowed by the allied invasion Europe. From June to August 1944, the squadron's history was mostly taken up with patrols nightly over the beachheads to guard the Allied troops and shipping against enemy bombers. Thirty-one times No. 410's Mosquitoes brought down their opponent and damaged or destroyed three more. Then the squadron moved to France and in the next eight months added 25 &quot;kills&quot; and a &quot;damaged&quot; to its score.16
Post D-Day
 The squadron was flying patrols and was getting many kills. In one instance Warrant Officer (W/O) W.F. Price and P/O J.G. Costello had shot down two Do.217 aircraft in twenty minutes. Since D-Day the Cougars had destroyed twelve enemy bombers. It was another five days before the squadron scored another kill. In the interval the crews, still maintaining their nine sorties a night schedule, had little to report. One night an engine in W/C Hiltz&lt;U+2019&gt;s Mosquito failed on the take-off run and the aircraft, swerving off the runway, crashed into &quot;A&quot; Flight dispersal. The crews escaped injury, but many buildings went up in flames.17 During an operation that resulted in the thirteenth kill, one aircraft crashed and its occupants never made it out. For the next week the weather was poor, restricting night operations. Most of the crews that did go out had to be diverted to other bases on their return. Enemy activity had also diminished and the beachhead was much quieter than it had been in mid-June. On the first two nights in July there were no sorties at all. Then the weather improved and the nightly round of nine patrols was resumed.18
F/L Currie and F/O Rose were the first to see the V-2 Rocket bomb, on the night of 10/11 September. While on patrol from Brussels to Antwerp and Rotterdam they saw a bright orange light dead ahead and seemingly at their own level, 10,000 feet. At first glance Currie paid no attention to it, taking it for a bright star. Suddenly, Currie said, &quot;it began to climb &lt;U+2013&gt; hell it climbed!&quot; The light appeared to go straight up, so rapidly that within a few seconds it had passed out of sight. On return to base the crew reported the sighting as a V-1 flying bomb, but their account of the spectacular rate of climb and other details aroused great interest at higher levels. That night, a few moments after Currie and Rose made their sighting, a V-2 crashed on the English coast. Two nights later F/Os Fullerton and Gallagher also saw a ball of yellow flame streak vertically into the night sky, and in the weeks that followed there were many more similar reports.19
Battle of the Bulge and end of war
During the battle all of the TAF, including No. 410 Squadron, was on 48 hour alert. In the middle of the month of December, under dreadful weather conditions, the Germans launched a surprise offensive on the Ardennes, also using the Luftwaffe, which caught many squadrons off guard. No. 410 Squadron enjoyed a number of successes, some of them even on Christmas day.20 Although the war was entering its final stages, the squadron had to watch out for flak. The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February while waiting for the Canadian push through the Reichwald on the Rhine to take place. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major fighting with the Luftwaffe occurred when the Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.21
On the evening of 18 December, during the Battle of the Bulge, Edinger was vectored to a Ju87, which Edinger then fired upon. His navigator, C.C. Vaessen, confirmed the kill stating that it had been on fire, having been hit in the starboard engine. The Ju87 crashed into the trees and was engulfed in flame.2223 During the final months of the war Flight Lieutenant Rayne Schultz claimed his fifth kill of the war after having returned from working at the Training Command. His fifth kill was a Ju188, which he claimed on 13/14 February 1944.24 Shortly afterwards he claimed a second Ju188 on 10/11 April 1945. He claimed his final kills on 21/22 April 1945 by downing two Ju88s near Ferrbellen.25
A few days after the Squadron moved to Lille/Vendeville it was called upon to provide a special patrol of four aircraft as air cover for Armistice Day ceremonies being held in Paris; no enemy intruders attempted to intervene. Later in the month there was a tragic accident at base which took the lives of two pilots who had joined the Cougars a short time previously. F/Os H. Connelly and J. Hunt had gone up together to practice circuits and landings. As they made a circuit, preparatory to landing, the Mosquito stalled and crashed from 500 feet. A few days before Christmas there was another disaster, the heaviest blow suffered by the squadron throughout its long career.26 For several days the airfield had been fogbound. When the sky cleared somewhat in the afternoon of the 21st, S/L Fulton, &quot;B&lt;U+201D&gt; Flight commander, took off for England in the Squadron Oxford. With him were three officers and two airmen, all going on leave. Near Wrotham, Kent, the aircraft for some reason crashed and only one of its occupants survived, seriously injured. Killed with S/L Fulton were his navigator F/O A.R. Ayton (RAF), who had accompanied him on posting to the Cougars in October, F/L F.G. Thomson, DFC (RAF), who had arrived late in November to begin a second tour, and LACs E. Wahlers and R. Seefried. F/O W. Rumbold, another RAF navigator, was the injured passenger; he had been with the Squadron for two months.27 The squadron was disbanded with the end of the war on 9 June 1945.28
Wartime commanders
The first commanding officer was Squadron Leader P.Y. Davoud, who was in charge between 30 June 1941 and 4 September 1941. Following his time as commander was Wing Commander (W/C) M. Lipton, who was in charge between 5 September 1941 and 30 July 1942. This position was then given to W/C F.W. Hillock, who was in charge between 19 August 1942 and 19 May 1943, when the position was given to W/C G.H. Elms, who was in charge between 20 May 1943 and 18 February 1944. In the latter part of the war W/C G.A. Hiltz, who was in charge between 19 February 1944 and 1 April 1945, was given command, and the last commander of the war was W/C E.P. Heybroek, who was in charge between 2 April 1945 and 9 June 1945.29

Individual awards
At least 12 members of the squadron were decorated during the war, with the award of 11 Distinguished Flying Crosses (DFC), plus one bar to the DFC, and a Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The first DFCs went to Acting Flight Lieutenant Martin Anthony Cybulski and Flying Officer Harold Herbert Ladbrook on 9 November 194331 The citation does not mention that they had to return to base on a single engine, and with other damage to the aircraft.32 This was followed by Flying Officers Rayne Dennis Schultz and Vernon Albert Williams on 14 January 1944.33 Again, the citation does not mention the severe damage to their own aircraft. At the close of the action with the third Do 217, which the combat report describes as: &quot;a long duel with the enemy pilot showing a high degree of airmanship,&quot; they were hit by return fire, with a cannon shell destroying much of the instrument panel, and narrowly missing the pilot. The starboard engine almost died, then recovered, but then the port engine caught fire. They managed to return to RAF Bradwell on the starboard engine, landing at 19:45 on 10 December 1943.34
Sergeant James Norman was awarded the DFM on 26 September 1944.35 Squadron Leader James Dean Somerville and F/O George Douglas Robinson were also awarded the DFC on 20 October 1944.3637 Then F/L Charles Emanuel Edinger on 5 December 1944, for destroying four Junkers Ju 88, and one unidentified German aircraft between June and October. He subsequently claimed one further Ju 88 and one Junkers Ju 87 in December.3839
Flight Lieutenants Ben Erwin Plumer and William Warren Hargrove also received the DFC on 15 December 1944 for shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 6 October:4041 F/O Dennis George Tongue was awarded the DFC on 29 December 1944,42 and a bar to his DFC on 2 March 1945.43 Tongue was a member of the RAF, and had been commissioned from sergeant, before his promotion to flying officer. His pilot on 25 November 1944, the night he won the bar to his DFC, was A. A. Harrington of the United States Army Air Force. The three aircraft they destroyed were Ju 88s, their own Mosquito was hit by debris from the second Ju 88, and during the fight that led to the downing of the third, Tongue was also having to keep track of a further Ju 88 which was endeavouring to attack them.44
F/O Donald Murdo Mackenzie was awarded the DFC on 27 February 1945,45 he had destroyed a Ju 88 on 30 July 1944, and two more in a single sortie on 24 December.46
Post-World War Two
 No. 410 Squadron was reactivated on 1 December 1946 as an Air Defence squadron flying de Havilland Vampire F.3 aircraft, and was re-formed from a defence role into that of a fighter role at St Hubert (Montreal), Quebec on 1 December 1948. The squadron later converted to Canadair Sabres and was deployed to Europe, flying from RCAF Station North Luffenham in the UK and RCAF Station Marville in France until the squadron was replaced by No. 445 Squadron in 1956. The squadron was the first postwar Regular Force fighter unit to fly Vampire and Sabre aircraft, and the first to join No. 1 (Fighter) Wing of No. 1 Air Division Europe.4748 When No. 445 All Weather (Fighter) [AW(F)] Squadron arrived from Canada, No. 410 was deactivated at Marville on 1 October 1956 and reactivated as an all-weather fighter squadron at Uplands (Ottawa), Ontario on 1 November, flying Avro Canada CF-100s. The CF-100s were removed from service and, in December 1961, the CF-101 Voodoo interceptors, were introduced for North American air defence. The squadron continued to fly Voodoos until defence cuts led to the squadron being deactivated. On 31 March 1964, the Cougars held their final parade, and at midnight No. 410 Squadron ceased to exist. In 1968, No. 3 OTU (Operating Training Unit) at CFB Bagotville, tasked with training pilots and navigators for the three operational CAF Voodoo squadrons was renamed No. 410 Squadron. In 1982, No. 410 Squadron made its most recent move to Cold Lake, Alberta, changing aircraft to become the training unit for Canada's new CF-18 Hornet aircraft.4950
Current
Operational training
No. 410 Squadron is now a Canadian Forces Air Command aircraft squadron located at Canada's primary CF-18 training base, Cold Lake, Alberta. The squadron was renamed 410 Tactical Fighter (Operational Training) Squadron, and has had this name since 1982.51 It runs one fighter pilot course every year, training approximately 20 fighter pilots. The training program consists of nine months of ground school, simulator flights, and operational flying. Graduates are taken from the Fighter Lead-In Training Course and are provided with the knowledge of basic skills in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. Areas covered in depth include aircraft handling, instrument flight, formation flying, night flying, navigation, air-to-air refuelling, and weapons delivery and tactics. No. 410 Squadron runs the annual Fighter Weapons Instructor Course (FWIC) and a Fighter Electronic Warfare and Advanced Radar (FEWAR) Course. The intense and highly challenging FWIC is three months in length.52 Each CF-18 squadron and tactical radar squadron sends candidates (eight students per course) who graduate with the leadership qualities and expertise required to return to their operational squadrons and design tactical training programs themselves. The Advanced Radar Course is conducted in two phases, ground school at 4 Wing and a flying phase at an electronic warfare range. This three-week course is designed to graduate ten pilots annually who return to their squadrons as electronic warfare experts and instructors. Since No. 410 Squadron has always had some of the most experienced CF-18 pilots in the fighter community, it is often charged with carrying out special fighter projects.. The Squadron conducted the operational testing and evaluation of the CF's precision guided munitions, and will be testing the use of night vision devices in the Hornet.53
FOTEF and 2009
A sub-unit of No. 410 Squadron is FOTEF, which is the &quot;Fighter Operational Test &amp; Evaluation Flight&quot;. FOTEF is responsible for the operational testing and evaluation to meet the needs of the Fighter Force (FF). Their efforts are to continue to be integral to the operational effectiveness of all aspects of core and CF-18 capabilities. Some the new systems being evaluated are Night Vision Imaging Systems (NVIS), Multi-function Information Distribution Systems (MIDS), the Advanced Multi-role Infra-Red Sensor, and the evaluation of new mission planning software and the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System.54 Working closely with a variety of key units across the Air Force including the &quot;Aerospace Engineering &amp; Test Establishment&quot; (AETE), FOTEF has enabled the integration of newly modernized CF-18 ECP-583 R2 aircraft into the FF. In 2009, No. 410 Squadron is providing the CF-18 Demonstration Pilot and the air display CF-18 for the year's airshow season. Captain Tim &quot;Donor&quot; Woods, from Dundas, Ontario, was been selected as the year's demonstration pilot and the paint scheme of his air display jet was developed in honour of the &quot;Centennial of Flight&quot; in Canada.55
Recertification and curriculum
The first seven courses the squadron ran were six month full-squadron courses in that the graduating pilots formed new CF-18 squadrons. Following this initial cadre of courses, No. 410 Squadron trained CF-18 pilots at a rate of approximately 50 per year. In 1992, with the closure of three squadrons in Germany, this was reduced to 25. With the recent reduction in size of the remaining operational squadrons, No. 410 Squadron now trains approximately 20 fighter pilots annually.56 At the same time as the current work mandate, No. 410 Squadron is also responsible for training and recertifying about five former CF-18 Hornet pilots annually. These pilots are returning to the CF-18 cockpit after a ground or exchange tour. Furthermore, No. 410 Squadron also trains newly arrived foreign exchange officers who will be joining one of Canada's two operational fighter squadrons. As backgrounds can differ significantly, each course is tailored to the individual based on their experience and demonstrated competencies.57 Areas covered in depth in the Fighter Pilot Course (FPC) include basic and advanced aircraft handling, instrument flight, formation flying, night flying, all-weather interception, air-to-air refuelling, Basic Fighter Manoeuvres (BFM - &quot;dogfighting skills&quot;) and air combat.58 The latter half of each FPC comprises academic air-to-ground weapons delivery and Close Air Support (CAS), as well as advanced Air Interdiction (AI) tactics, the former usually completed during a squadron deployment to the south-western United States in the late spring and early fall due to the significantly better weather and the sheer number of bombing ranges available.59
Jetstream
The television show Jetstream was filmed in 2007 with the squadron and showed life on the base and what pilots must endure to become fighter pilots. They stayed with 410 for nine months to become fighter pilots and in that time some candidates did not graduate.60 The television show was given full access to the candidates lives from ground school to graduation, and was allowed access almost everywhere. The series followed the six members of the Canadian Air Force's &quot;Class of 2006&quot; who had been selected to learn with 410.61 The television show called the air base &quot;fighter town&quot;, but Cold Lake is one of two bases that primarily use fighter/interceptor aircraft.62
Aircraft
A de Havilland Mosquito
Second World War
No. 410 Squadron RCAF began its flying career by flying the North American Harvard training aircraft. The Harvard was a single-engine advanced trainer aircraft designed by North American Aviation, used to train fighter pilots.63 The fighter that was first used was the Boulton Paul Defiant NFI during July 1941 to May 1942. The Boulton Paul Defiant was a &quot;turret fighter&quot; that was used as a night fighter by No. 410 Squadron. The main problem with this aircraft was that it had no forward armament,64 and so was exchanged for the Bristol Beaufighter II, which was used during April 1942 up until January 1943. The Beaufighter was a British long-range heavy fighter. The Mk II used the Rolls Royce Merlin engine for better power than the original Beaufighter.65 Later that year No. 410 changed to the de Havilland Mosquito Mk II in November 1942 through December 1943. Afterward the Squadron only used the Mosquito. It used the variants VI (July 1943 - September 1943), XIII (December 1943 - August 1944), and XXX (August 1944 - June 1945). All of these fighters had the same basic design, that of a low to medium altitude daytime tactical bomber, high altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike and photo reconnaissance aircraft.66
Post War
As a trainer 410 used the Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, a derivative of the T-33 Shooting Star. The Silver Star was a jet trainer aircraft that was powered with the Rolls Royce Nene 10 turbojet.67 After the Second World War No. 410 Squadron began flying the de Havilland Vampire. The Vampire was the second jet-powered aircraft commissioned by the Royal Air Force. It was used as a trainer aircraft that was easy to use.68 410 then reestablished the fighter force with the Sabre, which was one of the finest dogfighters of its day.69 The Canadair Sabre was a fighter aircraft that was designed to combat the early MiG fighters. Although the RAAF and the SAAF had trouble ordering the Sabre, because they were built in Canada by Canadair, under license, Canada was able to purchase them with relative ease. With the Korean War the initial batch of ten aircraft was increased to 100.70 Following the Sabre was the CF-100 Canuck, which came into service in 1953. The CF-100 Canuck, (affectionately known as the Clunk), was a Canadian jet fighter that was the only Canadian designed fighter aircraft that went into mass production. The CF-100 was equipped with an advanced radar and fire control system and so was used as Canada's primary interceptor.71 On 20 December 1961 410 became Canada's first operational CF-101 Voodoo squadron. The Voodoo was an all-weather interceptor aircraft. The Voodoo's primary armament was nuclear AIR-2A Genie unguided air-to-air rockets and was used as Canada's primary means of air defence.
Current
 No. 410 Squadron RCAF is currently equipped with the CF-18 Hornet. The first two CF-18 were formally handed over to 410 (Operational Training Unit) Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, Alberta on 25 October 1982.72 The McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet (CF-188) is a Canadian Forces aircraft, based on the American F/A-18 Hornet. The most visible difference between a CF-18 and a US F-18 is the 600,000 candela night identification light. This spotlight is mounted in the gun loading door on the port side of the aircraft.73 Some CF-18s have the light temporarily removed, but the window is always in place. Also, the underside of the CF-18 features a painted &quot;dummy canopy&quot;. This is intended to disorient and confuse an enemy in air-to-air combat. Many features that made the F/A-18 suitable for naval carrier operations were also retained by the Canadian Forces, such as the robust landing gear, the arrestor hook, and wing-folding mechanisms, which proved useful when operating the fighters from smaller airfields such as those found in the Arctic.74
