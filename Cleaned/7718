Kevin Peter Pietersen, MBE (born 27 June 1980) is a South African-born English cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and occasional off spin bowler who plays for England and Surrey. He had also played for Indian Premier League team Royal Challengers Bangalore for its second and third seasons, captaining the side in his first, prior to being bought by the Deccan Chargers for the fourth season of the competition. He was captain of the England Test and One Day International teams from 4 August 2008 to 7 January 2009 but resigned after just three tests and nine One Day Internationals, following a dispute with England coach Peter Moores, who was sacked the same day. He is regarded as one of the best batsmen in the world, and is certainly the most destructive,as he is capable of taking on any bowling.1
Pietersen was born in Pietermaritzburg, Natal, South Africa. He made his first-class debut for Natal in 1997 before moving to England after voicing his displeasure at the racial quota system in place in South Africa.2 His English mother gave Pietersen eligibility to play for England, and after serving a qualifying period of four years playing at county level, he was called up almost immediately into the national side. He made his international debut in the One Day International match against Zimbabwe in 2004,3 and his Test match debut in the 2005 Ashes series against Australia the following year.4 The England team's subsequent reliance on Pietersen since his debut has resulted in only one first-class appearance for Hampshire since 2005, which resulted in Pietersen looking to leave the club in 2010.5 He subsequently joined Surrey on loan for the remainder on the 2010 English county cricket season after being dropped by England due to a poor run of form, soon before joining the club permanently from the 2011 season onwards.67
Pietersen became the fastest batsman to reach both 1,000 and 2,000 runs in One Day International cricket,89 and the quickest in terms of time to 5,000 Test runs.10 He has the highest average of any England player to have played more than 20 innings of one-day cricket.11 He has the second-highest run total from his first 25 Tests, behind only the Australian Donald Bradman,12 and was the fastest player, in terms of days, to reach 4,000 Test runs.13 He became only the third English batsman to top the ICC One Day International rankings, doing so in March 2007.14 In July 2008, after a century against South Africa, The Times called him &quot;the most complete batsman in cricket&quot;.15 Shane Warne, a close friend, in a September serial for the same newspaper, wrote, &quot;I don't think he has an obvious flaw in his technique.&quot;16
Early and personal life
Born of an English mother, Penny, and an Afrikaner father, Jannie,17 Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three brothers Tony, Greg and Bryan;18 he learned valuable lessons from this &quot;fantastic&quot; approach to parenting, and said: &quot;Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn't always have to have what I wanted; that what I needed was different from what I wanted.&quot;19 Bryan plays club and second XI cricket in England.20
Pietersen attended Maritzburg College, Pietermaritzburg, and made his first-class cricket debut for Natal's B team in 1997, aged 17, where he was regarded predominantly as an off spin bowler and a hard-hitting lower-order batsman.2122 After two seasons, he moved to England for a five-month spell as the overseas player for club side Cannock CC, helping them win the Birmingham and District Premier League in 2000.23 This first spell away from home did not leave him with fond memories for England, in particular &quot;those horrible Black Country accents&quot; referring to the dialect of the Midlands, living in a single room above a squash court, and working in the club bar.24 However, he returned to newly renamed KwaZulu Natal side a better cricketer; a lack of opportunities to bowl had improved his batting.25
Having seen Pietersen play at a school cricket festival, Clive Rice invited him to sign for Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club. Pietersen accepted without hesitation, keen to make the most of top-class cricket under a coach for whom he had the utmost admiration. He did not at this stage contemplate forsaking his nation; nor had it yet occurred to him that the decision would eventually have to be taken.26
Pietersen is widely portrayed in the media as having a self-assured personality, described by Geoffrey Boycott as being &quot;cocky and confident&quot;.27 Former England test captain Michael Vaughan counters this, saying, &quot;KP is not a confident person. He obviously has great belief in his ability but that's not quite the same thing... And I know KP wants to be loved. I try to text him and talk to him as often as I can because I know he is insecure.&quot;28 He has been noted for unusual haircuts, with his peroxide blond dyed streak of hair along the middle of his head during the 2005 Ashes series being described as a &quot;dead skunk&quot; look.29 During the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 Ashes tour, the Australian team, noted for their efforts to dominate opponents psychologically, dubbed him &quot;The Ego&quot;, or &quot;FIGJAM&quot; (Fuck I'm Good, Just Ask Me).30 Other nicknames include KP, Kelves and Kapes.31
Kevin Pietersen published his autobiography: Kevin Pietersen: Crossing the Boundary in early 2007. A second biography: Kevin Pietersen: Portrait of a Rebel written by journalist Marcus Stead, was published in the autumn of 2009. This book includes a detailed account of the controversies of Pietersen's reign as England captain.
Pietersen is married to Liberty X singer Jessica Taylor.32 The couple married on 29 December 2007 at St Andrew's Church in Castle Combe, Wiltshire, with former England team-mate Darren Gough acting as best man.33 Their first child, Dylan Blake Pietersen, was born on 10 May 2010.
Domestic career
He impressed members of Nasser Hussain's England side when playing for KwaZulu Natal in 1999; he took four top-order wickets and, despite batting at number nine, scored 61 not out from 57 balls, hitting four sixes.34 Hussain then recommended that Pietersen secure a contract with an English county side.35
Despite the praise from the England side, Pietersen claimed he was dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen felt that this was due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were required to have at least four non-white players.363738 Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as &quot;heartbreaking&quot; when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected &quot;it turned out it was the best thing that could have happened&quot;.39 Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system,40 which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him &quot;an absolute muppet, childish and strange&quot; and that his behaviour &quot;leaves a lot to be desired&quot;.41 Smith opposed this, saying, &quot;I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa&quot;.42 Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for South African magazine GQ, led to unsuccessful calls for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.4344
In 2000, Nottinghamshire coach Clive Rice, who had seen Pietersen play in 1997 in South Africa at a schools week, heard that Pietersen was playing club cricket for the Cannock Cricket Club and offered him a three-year contract to play for the county.45 His maiden first-class century came on his Nottinghamshire debut against Loughborough UCCE.46 In his first season he made 1,275 runs with an impressive batting average of 57.95,47 including 218 not out in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 352 with John Morris at Derby in July, after having been out lbw for a duck in the first innings.48 These performances led to praise in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack: &quot;If he can maintain his first season's form, the name of Pietersen should be pencilled in for future Test squads.&quot;49 This form did indeed continue into the following year: he made another unbeaten double-century, against Middlesex, taking part in a partnership of 316 for the fourth wicket with Darren Bicknell.50 This period proved to be a purple patch for the batsman, scoring four consecutive centuries (254 not out, 122, 147 and 116) in one week in August.51
In 2003, Pietersen scored 1,546 first-class runs, and 764 runs in limited overs cricket.5253 He was selected for the 2003/04 ECB National Academy tour of India, and had a successful tour scoring 523 runs including three centuries in his six first-class innings to record an average of 104.60,54 and making 131 in a one-day match against India A in Bangalore.55
After Nottinghamshire were relegated in 2003, Pietersen requested a release from his contract, saying &quot;I haven't been happy for a while....The pitch at Trent Bridge has been one of my problems... I could have done so much better if the wicket had been good.&quot;56 This led to a public row with club captain Jason Gallian, where Gallian allegedly threw Pietersen's kit off the Trent Bridge balcony and broke his bat:
During the game I told the captain that I was not happy and that I wanted to leave. After the game we spoke in the dressing room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, 'if he does not want to play for Notts he can f*** off.' I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology.57
Pietersen was made to honour the last year of his contract at Nottinghamshire, but &quot;didn't enjoy it at all&quot;.58 In October 2004, he joined Hampshire under the captaincy of Shane Warne.59
After becoming a regular in the national side, Pietersen rarely gets an opportunity to play domestic cricket. Having an England &quot;central contract&quot; meant that Pietersen was only released to play for Hampshire at the discretion of the national coach. After being left out of the national side to face Bangladesh in May 2005, Pietersen had several good innings in the English County Championship, including two centuries.60 He only played twice for the county in 2006, and appeared just once in 2007, with an unbeaten 66 against Ireland.61 Pietersen's last first-class match for Hampshire came in the 2008 County Championship against Somerset, where he scored 100 runs in Hampshire's first innings,62 and following the birth of his son, a desire to stay in London led to him announcing he would leave Hampshire at the end of the 2010 season.63
Pietersen then joined Surrey on loan from Hampshire for the remainder of the 2010 English county cricket season.64 He scored a century in his first Clydesdale Bank 40 appearance against Sussex, with 116 off 105 deliveries.65 It was his first limited overs century since 2008, and his first century of any kind since March 2009. He subsequently signed permanently for Surrey from the 2011 season onwards, noting his delight for having joined the club.66 Pietersen had also rejoined his old team in South Africa, the Dolphins, for a short stint in October 2010.6768
International career
Success in South Africa
The tour of Zimbabwe caused several players to voice their concerns about the Robert Mugabe regime, the security issues in the country and the standard of the Zimbabwean side.69 Steve Harmison was the first to boycott the tour for &quot;political and sporting reasons&quot;,70 and all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was reported to be considering taking a moral stand himself. The England Chairman of Selectors David Graveney denied that the selectors would leave out players unhappy with touring Zimbabwe and would put their absences down to injury.71 Flintoff was, however, &quot;rested&quot; and Pietersen rushed into the squad &quot;at the earliest opportunity&quot;.72 In the five match ODI series, Pietersen batted in three innings which included a score of 77 not out; he finished the series with an average of 104.00 as England won the series 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0.
Pietersen was upset not to be initially in the squad to tour South Africa.73 With Flintoff withdrawing due to injury,74 Pietersen was recalled to the squad,75 and cemented his place in the first team with 97 off 84 balls in the warm-up match against South Africa A, in the face of a hostile crowd.76 Throughout the tour, Pietersen was subjected to a barrage of abuse from the South African crowd, who regarded him somewhat like a traitor.77 He said:
I knew I was going to cop a lot of stick but it will be like water off a duck's back...I expected stick at the start of the innings, and I'm sure it will carry on through the whole series. But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.78
Pietersen scored a 96-ball 108 not out in the tied second ODI at Bloemfontein, after which the crowd turned their backs on him as he returned to the pavilion.79 This score set his ODI average at an incredible record 234.00.8081 He made 75 at Cape Town,82 then at East London Pietersen made an unbeaten 100 from only 69 balls, the fastest century by an England player in a one-day match,83 although England still lost by eight runs. In the final game at Centurion Park, Pietersen came to the wicket at 32/3 and scored 116, but again could not prevent a defeat. Pietersen ended the series, which England lost 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1, with 454 runs in five innings, and the Player of the Series award.8485 By the end of the series, the South African crowds had generally replaced hostility with respect for Pietersen, his final century being awarded a standing ovation.86
Mixed success in Ashes build-up
Despite press speculation, Pietersen was not picked for the Tests against Bangladesh&lt;U+2014&gt;his early season form being dogged by a foot injury8788&lt;U+2014&gt;but with his county form improving, he was selected for the Twenty20 match against Australia at Southampton, making 34 from 18 balls and taking three catches as England won by 100 runs being awarded man of the match in the process.89
In the triangular ODI series against Australia and Bangladesh, Pietersen did not get to bat in the first match at The Oval as England won by 10 wickets, but scored 91 off 65 balls in the match in Bristol against Australia.90 In the remainder of the triangular series, Pietersen scored quickly, although without other half-centuries. In the final of the NatWest Series, he only made 6 as he finished the seven-match series with a total of 278 runs at an average of 46.33.91
Pietersen's performances sparked speculation over whether he would be brought into the Test side for The Ashes later in the summer. A BBC poll of 10 respected cricketers resulted in a minor preference for playing Pietersen and Ian Bell in the middle order, with Graham Thorpe missing out.92
Later in July, Pietersen played in all three matches of the (ODI) NatWest Challenge against Australia. In the final match he was the top scorer for England with 74 runs; however, he was forced off the field in the third over of Australia's reply with a groin injury.93
2005 Ashes triumph
  Speculation over when Pietersen would play for the Test team was ended in July with the announcement by the England chairman of selectors, David Graveney, that Pietersen had been selected ahead of Thorpe.94 He made his debut in the first Ashes Test at Lord's, becoming the 626th player to play for the national side.95 He came into bat at 18-3 and he made 57 on debut in his first innings. In the second innings, he similarly came in after a batting collapse and finished making a second half-century and finished the innings on 64 not out, becoming only the fourth player to top score in both innings on debut for England, the eighth England player to score a half-century in each innings on his debut, and the third cricketer to do so at Lord's.96 England were thrashed by 239 runs before moving onto Edgbaston where he came in in a more comfortable position scoring 71 in the first innings. He had a good partnership with Andrew Flintoff where the pair put on 103 very quickly. He made 20 in the second innings coming in at 31-4. He was involved in two controversial decisions. He gloved his first ball from Brett Lee, but the umpire turned down the appeal. Later, Shane Warne bowled a ball which hit his pad then elbow before being caught by Adam Gilchrist, and he was given out. The match ended with England narrowly winning by 2 runs.97
In the drawn third Test, Pietersen had his first quiet match when he scored 21 in the first innings, getting caught on the boundary. Then, with England looking to push on he was unfortunately dismissed lbw to Glenn McGrath for a golden duck. In the fourth test win at his former home ground Trent Bridge, he scored 45 in the first innings after facing 108 balls looking to build a big score. In the second innings chasing 129 to win, he was in at 57-4 when he scored 23 in a decent partnership again with Flintoff. He was dismissed when he was caught behind wafting at a ball outside off stump. However, England won and went 2&lt;U+2013&gt;1 up.9899 Under pressure to post a large score in the final Test at The Oval, Pietersen did not contribute significantly in the first innings with 14 as he was bowled for the first time in his Test career by Shane Warne. In the second innings, Pietersen was dropped on 0 by a combination of Gilchrist and Hayden, on 15 by his Hampshire colleague Shane Warne and after reaching fifty on 60 by Shaun Tait. He reached his maiden test century with a driven four off the bowling of Tait before making 158, eventually being dismissed by Glenn McGrath. This innings helped to secure the return of the ashes to England for the first time since the late 1980s.100101 His innings included seven sixes, breaking Ian Botham's record for the most sixes by an English player in an Ashes innings.102 Pietersen was named Man of the Match for his efforts,103 and finished the series as top scorer, with 473 runs over the five Tests, an average of 52.55 which also was the highest in the series.104 However, he had a less successful series in the field, dropping six catches in the five Tests, a point he made wryly when questioned about the Australians dropping him three times on the final day.105 Pietersen was given an ECB &quot;central contract&quot; to reflect his place in the national side.106
Less rewarding winter tour
 Pietersen had a less successful time in the three Test matches against Pakistan, which England lost 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0. He made little impact in the first and third test. His first Test match innings since his match winning 158 against Australia was brief as he was caught at short leg for 5. In the second innings, he was criticised for his dismissal. Chasing just 198, he was caught behind after a horrible slog on 19 as England went onto lose by 22 runs. In the third test, he made 34 before edging behind in the first innings. With England indifficulty, Pietersen edged Danish Kaneria to short leg when only on one, as England were to be defeated by an innings.107108 He fared better in the second, however, making his second Test century in the first innings. He brought up his hundred with a six before next ball, he top-edged a pull and was out. In the next innings, with England needing to bat out a draw, England were 20-4 but he made 42 to help England get the draw.109 He was also performing well in the one-day series with two explosive innings of 56 from 39 balls to help England win the first ODI, and 28 from 27 balls in the second.110111 The quick-scoring innings in the second ODI was to be Pietersen's last on the tour. A rib injury sustained in the first ODI proved too painful throughout the second, and Pietersen returned to England to recover fully for the tour of India.112
In March 2006, Pietersen played in the three Tests against India, which England drew 1&lt;U+2013&gt;1. In the first innings on 15, another rash shot brought his downfall. He pulled a ball from Sreesanth onto his stumps. His 87 in the second innings of the first match came during England's acceleration period, helping push the required target over 300.113 England then declared overnight, and India successfully batted out the final day to secure a draw. This half-century was followed by another in the first innings of the second Test. Again, he gave his wicket away on 64 when he offered Munaf Patel a return catch. The second innings was not so good, facing just 13 balls before being given out caught behind off a Harbhajan Singh delivery. The unhappy Pietersen was later fined 30 percent of his match fee for shaking his head and showing signs of dissent.114 &quot;Replays demonstrated that the ball that had dismissed him had brushed his forearm, not his glove, before ballooning up into the hands of Rahul Dravid at slip. But umpire Darrell Hair gave him out for 4 as England collapsed on the fourth afternoon.&quot;115 Pietersen posted a score of 39 in the first innings of the third test before he got a beauty from Sreesanth which moved and took the edge of the bat before being caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. In the second innings, he posted 7 again being caught and bowled, this time by Anil Kumble via a leading edge. Despite a quiet match for him, England won comfortably after a dismal 100 all out in India's second visit to the crease.116
In the one-day series, which England lost 5&lt;U+2013&gt;1, he was top scorer for England in four out of the five matches he played, and had the highest average of any player with 58.20.117 His 71 in the second ODI took him past 1,000 ODI runs, equalling Viv Richards' record of 21 innings to reach this total.118
Sri Lanka and Pakistan in England, 2006
 In May 2006, Pietersen matched his highest Test score of 158 in the first match against Sri Lanka. His innings was ended when he was lbw to Chaminda Vaas.119 In the second test he made 142 at Edgbaston. He made almost half of England's runs. After he made his hundred, his third six, saw the introduction to the Switch hit when he turned out and played a switch hitted sweep of Muttiah Muralitharan. This took him past the milestone of 1,000 Test runs, in his 12th Test match, and he became the first batsman since Graham Gooch in 1990 to score a century in three successive Test innings on English soil.120 This performance moved Pietersen into the top ten of the ICC cricket ratings. In the third test, he was twice removed by Murali. In the first innings, on 41, he top edged a sweep to short fine leg. In the second innings with England chasing 325, he was caught at short leg for just 6. Despite this, his performances in the first two tests earned him the England (Test Match) Player of the Series.121122 In the first and second tests of the Pakistan series, he got starts with the bat but didn't get past 50. He was lbw offering no shot in the first innings at Lords for 21. In the second innings, when England were pushing on, he played some nice strokes in his 41 before being stumped of the bowling of Shahid Afridi. In the second test, he made 38 hen he hit a half-volley loosely to point. In the third test at Headingley, he hit 135 runs from England's total of 515.123 In the final controversial test at The Oval, on a horribly wet pitch, he got the second golden duck of his Test career when he edged behind. In the second innings, he made 96 before edgind behind again before the test came to an unexpected early end.
Pietersen bowled his first delivery in Test match cricket on 4 June, against Sri Lanka.124 His first Test wicket came against Pakistan later in the summer when Kamran Akmal got a thin edge through to Geraint Jones.125
Later in June, Pietersen scored 17 in the Twenty20 International as England lost by 2 runs to Sri Lanka.126 The twenty over match against Pakistan was no better, Pietersen being bowled by Mohammad Asif for a golden duck as Pakistan helped themselves to a five-wicket victory.127
England in Australia, 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07
In the much-anticipated Ashes series in Australia, Pietersen was hyped up as England's best player and this was justified as he scored 490 runs in five matches and averaged over fifty, despite Australia's obvious targeting of him. &quot;I was interested to see how he would get on in Australia in 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 on pitches with more bounce,&quot; wrote Warne, &quot;because bowlers had tried to test him with the short ball. He was still England's best batsman.&quot;128
He started well, in the First Test. Despite a failure of 16 in the first test, he produced a fine spell of batting with a good 92 in the second innings. This wasn't enough to save England from a 277 run defeat.129 In the second Test, he backed up his good form with a century in the Second Test in Adelaide, sharing a 310-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Paul Collingwood. When he was eventually run out, his first reaction was to &quot;giggle&quot; because it was the third time in his Test career that he had scored exactly 158 runs, which was, at that point, his highest Test score. However, he made 2 in a disastrous second innings collapse which cost England dear.130 In the third test, he was the only batsman to offer any resistance with 70 in the first innings and 60 not out in the second innings in a defeat which cost England the Ashes. However, he couldn't carry on that form as he failed to make a half-century in the final two test as England lost five&lt;U+2013&gt;nil.131
In the tour's sole Twenty20 match, Pietersen was run out on eleven as England lost by 77 runs.132 Remarkably, for a powerful hitter, Pietersen has not yet posted a large score in the specialised twenty-over format, in which he averages 15.50.133 In the first One Day International of the 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07 Commonwealth Bank Series, on 12 January at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Pietersen was injured when a ball bowled by Glenn McGrath hit him on the ribs. Despite continuing his innings in some discomfort, making 82, X-rays revealed a fracture, and Pietersen was forced to miss the rest of the series.134
Career in 2007
2007 World Cup
In the 2007 Cricket World Cup, England started in Group C with a game against New Zealand in which KP made 60 before holing out. He made another 50 against Kenya but disappointedly made just 5 against Canada as England sealed qualification. He made 48 in the unconvincing win against Ireland. Pietersen made 58 against Sri Lanka before being caught and bowled by Murali. England lost that game by 2 runs before losing the next game against Australia by 7 wickets. Pietersen crafted 104 runs off 122 balls against Australia. It was the first World Cup century by an Englishman since 1996, and the first ever against Australia.135 His efforts in the World Cup helped him achieve the status of International Cricket Council number-one ranked batsman in the world for ODIs.136 He then failed making 10 against Bangladesh and 3 against South Africa. England lost to South Africa meaning that England did not reach the semi-finals. In England's final match of the World Cup against the West Indies, Pietersen made 100 from 91 balls, and effected the run-out of retiring captain Brian Lara.137 This century took him past 2,000 ODI runs, in doing so equalling the record 51 matches set by Zaheer Abbas.138 He finished the tournament with 444 runs, at an average of 55.5, and was described as shining in the England team &quot;like a 100 watt bulb in a room full of candles&quot;.139
West Indies in England
In the first test of the series he was dismissed for 26 again chasing a wide one when looking set also after 4 centuries were scored by England batsmen in the innings at Lord's,he then scored a hundred in the second innings when England were looking to accelerate.140 Pietersen posted his highest score of 226 in the second Test at Headingley (it was scored in 262 balls, with 24 fours and 2 sixes), surpassing his previous best of 158 which he had achieved three times.141 With this score, Pietersen moved ahead of Everton Weekes and Viv Richards to be the batsman with the second-highest run-total out of his first 25 Tests (behind Don Bradman).142 It is also the highest Test score for England since Graham Gooch scored 333 against India in 1990.143 This innings subjected the West Indies to an innings and 283 runs defeat, their largest against any team. Pietersen, the Man of the Match, said, &quot;I believe the recipe for success is hard work. I've been criticised for throwing my wicket away, and I tried to make it count here&quot;.144
In the third Test at Old Trafford, he carried on his bad run at the ground being bounced out twice for 9 and 68. In the second innings, Pietersen lost his wicket in a bizarre dismissal when West Indian all-rounder Dwayne Bravo delivered a bouncer which knocked Pietersen's helmet off his head and onto his stumps. He is only the fourth batsman in Test cricket to be dismissed &quot;hit wicket&quot; as a result of headgear falling onto the stumps.145 This score took him past the 8,500 first-class runs mark, and 2,500 runs in Test cricket.146 In the final match of the series, he registered his third duck of his Test career in the first innings and 28 in the second innings as England won the series 3-0.
In contrast, Pietersen's batting was poor in the following single innings matches; he scored a total of 77 runs in five matches (two Twenty20 and three ODI), recording a second-ball duck in the final ODI.147 He subsequently fell to second in the official One Day International batting rankings, behind Ricky Ponting.148 Pietersen himself commented that his lack of form was a result of &quot;fatigue&quot;, and reiterated his calls for a less &quot;hectic&quot; match schedule.149
India tour and Twenty20 Championship
Pietersen played in the first Test against India and in the first innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of Zaheer Khan to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, he walked back to the middle and the decision was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very testing conditions.150 In the second test, he was twice lbw to RP Singh for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101.151 In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.
Pietersen was also picked for and played in the Twenty20 Championship in South Africa. In England's first game against Zimbabwe on 13 September, Pietersen hit 79 runs off 37 balls, his highest Twenty20 score, including seven fours and four sixes (one of them being another switch-hit sweep for six) in an English total of 188&lt;U+2013&gt;9. England won the match by 50 runs; however, this was to be Pietersen's largest contribution in the competition. He scored another 99 runs over four more matches, ending the series with an average of 35.60. He also scored the most England fours (17) and jointly held the record for the most England sixes (6) with Owais Shah. He also held the highest strike rate of any England batsman.152
Sri Lanka 2007
Pietersen scored 50 in England's opening game in Sri Lanka against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI,153 but it took until the fourth ODI for Pietersen to find form, scoring 63 not out as England won their first series in Sri Lanka.154 This form was still fluctuating in the warm-up matches for the Test series, scoring 4, 1 and 59 against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI. This run continued in the Test matches when in the first test he got two starts with 31 and 18 but didn't go on. He was unfortunate as in the second innings on 18 he was bowled by a ball that kept low from Dilhara Fernando. In the second test he managed 45 not out to secure a draw in the 2nd Test. In the first innings, Pietersen's dismissal was to be the source of much controversy. He edged his fifth ball to Chamara Silva at slip, who flicked the ball up for wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara to complete the catch. The two on-field umpires conferred over the validity of the catch, as it was unclear whether the ball had touched the ground prior to Silva flicking the ball up. Daryl Harper, standing at the bowler's end gave the decision that the wicket had been taken, but while walking off the field, Pietersen saw a replay on the big screen and questioned the validity of the decision. This led for calls for similar catches to be referred to the third (TV) umpire, but this can only take place if the on-field umpires have not made a decision.155 Pietersen passed 3,000 Test runs during the series, becoming the fastest player (by time) to do so,156157 He only averaged 25.20, and failed to score a half century in a series for the first time.158
Career in 2008
New Zealand tours (home and away)
On England's tour against New Zealand, Pietersen averaged 33.00 in the ODI series, with one score of 50 in the tied fourth match; England lost the series 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1.159 He also made a top score of 43 in the first of two comfortable Twenty20 matches.160 Pietersen had a quiet first two Test matches, making little impression with the bat. He produced 42 and 6 as England collapsed in their second innings. In the next test, he fared little better making 31 and 17. However, in the first innings of the Napier Test he rescued England from a disastrous start of 4-3, guiding them to 259 with 129, his 11th Test century.161
New Zealand then came to tour England and Pietersen again struggled in the first two Test matches, scoring 3 in the first match. He improved slightly in the second but only making 26 in the first innings and then running himself out on 42 having looked well set.162 He seemed to be struggling particularly against Daniel Vettori but he showed no signs of that as he struck a century in the third Test, forming a valuable partnership with Tim Ambrose, making a crucial 115.163 Pietersen hit a winning 42 not out in the Twenty20 match.
The switch-hit
In the first ODI of the NatWest series, Pietersen hit two sixes by &quot;switch-hitting&quot; en route to 110 not out. While facing the bowling of medium pace Scott Styris, Pietersen turned his body around and switched hands (effectively batting as a left-hander) hitting two sixes over cover and long off. Because Pietersen not only reversed his hand position (as some batsman do while playing the reverse sweep), but changed his stance by rotating his body, these &quot;switch-hit&quot; shots were immediately followed by calls to outlaw them from the game.164 Although a similar shot was played when Pietersen reverse-swept Muttiah Muralitharan for six in Sri Lanka in 2006, he only switched hands and executed &quot;the switch&quot; after the ball was bowled, and not before, as in this case.
Several commentators claim that because Pietersen changed from being a right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that &quot;A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming will depend on the placement of the off stump&quot;. Ian Healy seconded this by saying &quot;It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit to one side of the field, you've got to do it in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.&quot; This ideal was echoed by former fast-bowler Michael Holding, who rather than calling for the shot to be banned, advocated the latter scenario whereby bowlers do not have to inform the umpire, or batsman, of a change of delivery.165
Pietersen countered these claims by saying:
&quot;That's ridiculous, absolutely stupid. The reverse-sweep has been part of the game for however long. I am just fortunate that I am able to hit it a bit further. Everybody wants brand new ideas, new inventions and new shots. That is a new shot played today and people should be saying it's a new way to go. There are new things happening for cricket at the moment and people shouldn't be criticising it all the time.&quot;166
Another citation for the shot being outlawed was that the possibility of being out LBW (&quot;a player is out LBW if...the ball pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker's wicket&quot;) is removed, as the off side become the leg side and vice versa.167 The shots were considered by the MCC, governors of the game, who came to the conclusion that the shot was legal, believing that the LBW law (which continues &quot;The off side of the striker's wicket shall be determined by the striker's stance at the moment the ball comes into play for that delivery&quot;) adequately covers the scenario.168169 They cited the variations bowlers can make, such as bowling a googly or a slower ball, and also the inherent risk in the shot to the batsman, in the justification of their decision.170
There are still calls for further review of the stroke, with Jonathan Agnew giving a scenario in which a right-handed batsman can take his stance as a left-hander, then switch stance as the bowler runs in, thus being able to kick away any balls that land outside his now off stump. He also calls for the wide law to be adjusted in one-day cricket, as bowlers are penalised for most deliveries that pass down the leg side.171
England captaincy
Success against South Africa
Pietersen captained England in the fifth ODI against New Zealand after Paul Collingwood was banned for four games for a slow over-rate during the previous match. New Zealand won to finish the series 3-1 and Pieterson scored only 6. England's unofficial vice-captain since Collingwood's appointment in June 2007, Pietersen was named as the stand-in captain for three further matches in August.172
 With Michael Vaughan as captain for the first three tests, Pietersen seemed to thrive in his first Test series against his former countrymen scoring 152 in the opening match of the series. During the third Test against South Africa, Pietersen was criticized for throwing his wicket away attempting a six to complete a century when on 94. Jonathan Agnew and Alec Stewart called the stroke &quot;irresponsible&quot; and Agnew continued, suggesting that Pietersen therefore ruled himself out of the potential reckoning for the England captaincy with Vaughan's place in the starting line-up in doubt after failing to score runs.173 In the event, having lost the match, Vaughan resigned and Pietersen was made the permanent captain of both the Test and ODI sides (Paul Collingwood relinquished the ODI captaincy at the same time).174 Following the news that he had been made England Test and ODI captain, Pietersen paid tribute to both outgoing captains but announced that he would look to captain the team in his own style.175 He scored a century in his debut match as captain in the dead rubber fourth Test, and went on to defeat South Africa 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0 in the ODI matches. In that series he made 90 not out and got 2-22 with the ball. In the fourth ODI, another dead rubber as England were 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 up, he hit a quick 40 to guide England to victory.
Derailment against India
Pietersen continued to lead the team during a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;0 defeat to India in ODI matches; the series was supposed to consist of seven matches, but was abandoned after the fifth due to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Pietersen however had a decent series with the bat hitting a quick 63 in the first match and 111 not out in the fifth match. Pietersen's men returned to England before resuming the tour amid unprecedented security, to play a two-Test series. Pietersen was highly vocal in regards to the resumption of the tour, citing a need to stand up to terrorism. He had an aggregate of 5 runs in 2 innings in the first test being dismissed by Yuvraj Singh in the second innings which showed Pietersen's struggles against Yuvraj from the ODI series carried on. England were defeated in the first, however the team recovered to draw the second with Pietersen scoring 144.
In January 2009, following England's losses in India, the media reported that Pietersen had asked the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to hold emergency meetings to discuss Moores' coaching role with the team.176 Days later, Pietersen made remarks to the media about there being an 'unhealthy situation' that needed to be resolved in the England camp. The media speculated that Moores would shortly be replaced if there was a Pietersen&lt;U+2013&gt;Moores rift. Moores and Pietersen were believed to be in disagreement on several issues, including the team's training regimen, and the possible selection of former England captain Michael Vaughan for the upcoming tour of the West Indies.177 On 7 January 2009, Moores was removed as England's coach by the ECB, and Pietersen unexpectedly resigned as captain.178 In the immediate aftermath of Pietersen's resignation, several commentators connected with English cricket indicated that they believed that Pietersen had miscalculated by openly advocating for the removal of Moores, particularly in making their dispute public.179 In an interview several days after his resignation, Pietersen revealed that he had not intended to resign as captain, but was told by ECB officials that he was resigning.180 Dennis Amiss, the vice-chairman of the ECB, went on record backing up Pietersen in his statement that the story of the rift with Moores had not been leaked to the media by him, saying, &quot;We don't believe Kevin Pietersen leaked the information, we understand his frustration at it being leaked by other parties.&quot;181 Pietersen was captain for three Test matches, and 10 One Day International matches. It was announced that Andrew Strauss would take over the captaincy.182
2009
England in West Indies
In his first match after resigning from the captaincy he scored 97 in the first innings of the first test. West Indies had a lead of 74 and incredibly England were bowled out for 51 with Pietersen making just 1 being bowled by a beautiful out-swinger by Jerome Taylor as England collapsed to an innings defeat. After the second test was abandoned, he scored 51 in the &quot;third test&quot;. His good form carried on as he scored 72 not out to give England the draw at Barbados. In the fifth and final test, with England needing to win, Pietersen hit his quickest test century with 102 of 92 balls including the switch-hit and an incredible flick of his legs. He struggled in the one-day series that followed with his top score being 48.
Indian Premier League
In February 2009, Royal Challengers Bangalore of the Indian Premier League bought Pietersen for USD 1,550,000. This made him the highest-paid IPL player along with Andrew Flintoff surpassing Mahendra Singh Dhoni's USD 1,500,000. On 22 March, the owner Vijay Mallya announced that Pietersen would succeed Rahul Dravid as the Bangalore captain. Pietersen won two out of his six matches in charge before leaving to fulfil his international commitments with England; Anil Kumble took over the captaincy and led the Bangalore team to the IPL final.183
West Indies and the World Twenty20
Pietersen began 2009 with questions over his form, where many pundits viewed him to be in a slump.184 He was dismissed first ball in the first Test against the touring West Indies side dismissed by the full, swinging ball (a delivery which he seemed to struggle against), but in the second Test made a quick 49 before falling to an attacking shot. He then suffered what seemed only a minor right Achilles injury and was subsequently ruled out of the ODI series, which England also won.185 In June 2009, Pietersen played in England's World Twenty20 warm-up match against Scotland, registering an unbeaten 53 in a six-wicket England victory.186 He also appeared in the news after accidentally hitting a 15-year old school boy with a cricket ball from a straight-drive after the boy had bowled to him. Pietersen left the boy, from Suffolk, with a signed bat as compensation.187
Pietersen broke down again ahead of England's first Twenty20 match, against the Netherlands not long after. &quot;It was a huge shock for me,&quot; he reported the day after his come-back against Pakistan, &quot;and a huge shock for everybody, because everything had been going according to plan. I'd played pain-free on Tuesday and Wednesday, and, on Thursday, I had a long training session, but I woke up in the morning [on Friday], and I couldn't walk down the steps of my house.&quot; He went on:
I'm as frustrated as anybody because I hate missing any games of cricket. I love playing cricket for England; there's nothing better than playing for England and being in such a huge tournament here in the UK: it's huge. I didn't want to miss Friday, and I certainly wasn't going to miss last night. I was going to play even if I was only fifty per cent fit because I want to play for England &lt;U+2014&gt; I love playing for England &lt;U+2014&gt; and I didn't want us to get knocked out of the tournament.188
In Pietersen's absence, England incurred a historic loss against the Dutch.189 He returned for the second match against Pakistan and top scored with 58 of 38 balls and hit 3 sixes (one of which was measured at over 100m) in the 48 run victory,190 he also top scored in the three run win over India later in the competition.191 Despite missing the first match Pietersen ended the tournament as England's leading runscorer with 154 at an average of 38.50.192
2009 Ashes
Pietersen joined the England Ashes squad in June 2009 for the upcoming 2009 Ashes series. Despite failing to surpass single figure scores during a warm-up match against Warwickshire,193 he helped England to a score over 400 on July 8 during the first day of the first Test at the SWALEC Stadium, Cardiff with 69 before being dismissed by Nathan Hauritz, top-edging a sweep to a ball outside off stump; the dismissal was heavily criticised. He also seemed to flare up his Achilles injury again suddenly which hampered his batting a bit. In the second innings he was bowled for 8 after leaving a straight ball from Ben Hilfenhaus. Many pundits thought the criticism of England's key batsman from the first innings possibly affected him.194 In the first innings at Lords, after proving his fitness, he came at 222-2 and played some trademark shots before being caught behind off Peter Siddle. In the second innings he came in when England had a lead of almost 300 and he and Ravi Bopara batted for time. Pietersen limped when he ran and many shots ran off the inside edge which raised serious doubts for the rest of the series. He actually did well to reach 44 before being caught behind off Siddle again. After struggling in the field as England won, Pietersen was ruled out of the rest of the series with an Achilles injury.195 This brought to an end 54 consecutive Test matches. As his recovery slowed, Pietersen was not included in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy and Andy Flower speculated that due to an infection of the wound Pietersen &quot;may miss this winter's tour of South Africa because of slow progress in recovery from surgery.&quot;196
Career in 2010
Pietersen returned from injury in time to play a part in the 2009-10 winter tour of South Africa. His contributions, nevertheless, have been significantly below his pre-injury range with an average innings of just 27. He has shown several lapses of concentration, leading some to suggest that off-field distractions and lingering issues with his removal from the captaincy are still affecting his form.197 Former England batsman and commentator Geoffrey Boycott detected a new technical fault of playing across full-length deliveries.198
Bangladesh and return to form
Pietersen went into the two match tour of Bangladesh on the back of poor performances since his return from injury lead to speculation Pietersen's England place was under pressure.199 However, an important first innings of 99 in the first Test and a series clinching score of 74 not out in the second, during a stand of 167 not out with Alastair Cook, saw Pietersen return to much more respectable figures. England won the series 2-0 and Pietersen finished with total runs of 250 and an average for the series of 83.33.
2010 Indian Premier League
Pietersen joined up with his Royal Challengers Bangalore team following the conclusion to England's tour of Bangladesh. Pietersen showed further signs of a return to form in the IPL by scoring 236 runs with a high score of 66*, with an average of 59.00, which was the highest in the IPL.200
2010 ICC World Twenty20
Pietersen was selected in England's 15 man squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies. Pietersen's tournament got off to a poor start as he made was dismissed for duck by Rory Kleinveldt in a warm up match.201 In England's first match against the West Indies, Pietersen started confidently scoring 24 from 20 balls before being dismissed on the pull by Darren Sammy.202 Against Ireland, he struggled to get going, scoring a slow 9 from 18 balls.203 In England's super eights match against Pakistan he scored 73* from 52 balls, guiding England to a 6 wicket win.204 In the following super eights match against South Africa, Pietersen scored an aggressive 53 runs from 33 balls, contributing to a 94 run partnership with Craig Kieswetter and a 39 run victory for England. For his performance, he was named man of the match.205
Following the conclusion of this match, Pietersen returned home to England to be present at the birth of his son.206 Pietersen returned in time for England's semi-final against Sri Lanka, where he scored a vital 42* from 26 balls, guiding England home to a 7 wicket victory207 and a place in their first ICC tournament final since the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. In the final against old foes Australia, he scored 47 runs from 31 balls, which included 4 fours and 1 six. Pietersen shared in a vital stand of 111 with Kieswetter, before holing out to David Warner off the bowling of Steve Smith. Pietersen's knock was vital in helping England secure a 7 wicket victory and their first ever major ICC tournament victory.208 After the match Pietersen was named man of the series for his vital contributions with the bat, which ended with Pietersen being the second highest run scorer with 248 runs at an average of 62.00 and a strike rate of 137.77.209
Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan
 Pietersen played in the Bangladesh home series, however contributed only 18 in the first innings before assisting England in chasing down a modest total with 10*. He made 64 in the second Test, however.210 After the Test series, attention was drawn to Pietersen's lack of games for Hampshire - having not played a County Championship at the Rose Bowl since 2005. Having made one Twenty20 appearance for them against Surrey after the Bangladesh Test series, it was announced that he would be leaving Hampshire, stating that &quot;Geographically it just doesn't work. I live in Chelsea.&quot;211 On June 22, Pietersen played his 100th ODI against Australia at his home ground, the Rose Bowl. 
Pietersen struggled for form in an ODI series against Australia and then a Test series against Pakistan. England beat Australia 3-2, but Pietersen could only manage a top-score of 33. England beat Pakistan 3-1, and although Pietersen top-scored for England with 80 in the second Test, it was the only time he passed 50 and ended the series with a golden duck. His poor form, and an admission by Pietersen before the final Test that he was low on confidence, led to many in the media, including Geoffrey Boycott, to suggest that Pietersen could do with playing County Cricket to regain his form before the 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 Ashes series.
Pietersen was omitted from both of England's limited-overs squads to face Pakistan. However, the ECB brokered a loan move to Surrey for the remainder of the 2010 English cricket season which enables him to play first-class cricket whilst the England side plays Pakistan in the limited overs leg of the tour. Pietersen announced the omission and loan-move to Surrey early through a Twitter message, which contained a swear-word and was quickly removed, and he apologised the following day. The online outburst drew some criticism of him, with national selector Geoff Miller one of those criticising the message. During the lead up to the 2010/11 Ashes Series Pietersen signed up for two first class games in the South African competition with the KwaZulu Natal Dolphins.
The Ashes down under
Pietersen went into the 2010-11 Ashes series without a century since March 2009, and many felt that England would be unable to retain the Ashes unless he found form. In the first Test at The Gabba, Brisbane, Pietersen hit 43 in the first innings but wasn't required in the second as England posted 517-1 declared before a draw was declared.
In the second Test in Adelaide, where he hit 158 on the previous Ashes tour, Pietersen joined opener Alastair Cook (148) to make an century partnership before going onto to score his 17th Test century. He finished with 227, a Test-best and his second Test double-century, as England declared on 620-5. Given a rare bowl at the end of the fourth day, Pietersen claimed the wicket of Michael Clarke (80) to leave Australia 238-4. England then proceeded to bowl Australia out in the final morning to win by an innings and 71 runs, and Pietersen was named man-of-the-match.212

Pietersen gained several awards for his performances in the 2005 season. He was named both the ICC ODI Player of the Year and Emerging Player of the Year in 2005,213 and was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year (alongside team mates Simon Jones and Matthew Hoggard) for his role in the successful Ashes series against Australia.214 Along with the rest of the England team, he was decorated in the 2006 New Year Honours list, being awarded the MBE for his role in the successful Ashes series.215 He also played for the ICC World XI in the ICC Super Series 2005 against Australia.216
