History
Since its construction in 1970 by wealthy businessman Marcel Adams, owner of the company D&lt;U+00E9&gt;veloppement Iberville, Le Concorde has been operated by the luxury hotel management company Loews under the terms of a 99-year lease. In 2069, at the end of this lease, ownership will return to Adams or his successor.
In November 2013, Loews announced that the building would cease operations as a hotel in February 2014.1 Early in January, it was announced that the hotel would be sold to Groupe Savoie in order to transform it into a retirement apartment building.
