Career
1980s: Beginnings and early breakthrough
Arjona began his musical career at age 21,11 when he signed with record label PolyGram12 and released his debut album D&lt;U+00E9&gt;jame Decir Que Te Amo in 1985. The label attempted to portray Arjona as a stereotypical Latin-lover.13 The title track was released as a single, &quot;D&lt;U+00E9&gt;jame Decir Que Te Amo&quot;. This album failed to chart, but received moderate critical success, with Allmusic awarding it 3 stars out of five.14 Because of his negative experience recording the album and its commercial failure, he decided to abandon music to teach school.15
At age 24, Arjona reversed himself and sought the opportunity to represent his country on the OTI Festival with the song &quot;Con Una Estrella En El Vientre&quot;.16 The sessions immediately following this decision produced the song &quot;S.O.S Resc&lt;U+00E1&gt;tame&quot;.17 His second studio album, Jes&lt;U+00FA&gt;s, Verbo No Sustantivo brought him commercial and critical success over Latin America and the U.S. and became a best-seller in many Central American territories.1819

Arjona started the new decade known throughout Latin America. After joining Sony Music in 1990 he released Del Otro Lado del Sol,20 one of his least successful. That year he started composing songs for other artists, such as Yuri's &quot;Detr&lt;U+00E1&gt;s De Mi Ventana&quot;, for her album Nueva era (1993).

The album sold 2 million copies throughout Latin America and received twenty-seven platinum and two diamond certifications,29 including quadruple Platinum in Argentina.30 Historias reached #43 on Top Latin Albums.31 Hit singles included &quot;Te Conozco&quot; (#3 on Billboard Latin Songs) and &quot;Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;ora De Las Cuatro D&lt;U+00E9&gt;cadas&quot; (#7 on Latin Songs).32 The Allmusic review by Jason Birchmeier awarded the album 4.5 stars stating that &quot;If you were to pick only one Arjona album for your collection that wasn't a greatest-hits compilation, this should be the one. Historias was a career-defining success for Arjona.&quot;33 His fourth and fifth studio albums were the best-selling of his career.3435
In 1996, he released his sixth studio album, Si El Norte Fuera El Sur. This was the first album in which Arjona ventured beyond the theme of love to explore nationalism and globalization, among other sociopolitical topics.36 Its four singles were &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; (#9 on Latin Pop Songs),37 whose main theme is the relationship between the United States and Latin America,38 &quot;Tu Reputaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n&quot; (#18 on Latin Songs, #2 on Latin Pop Songs), &quot;Me Ense&lt;U+00F1&gt;aste&quot; (#18 on Latin Pop Songs), and &quot;Ella y &lt;U+00C9&gt;l&quot; (#24 on Latin Songs, #8 on Latin Pop Songs).3940 Birchmeier awarded the album 4.5 stars stating &quot;All in all, it's Arjona's third classic album in a row, each distinct from its predecessor.&quot;41 Billboard named it the Rock Album of the Year in 1997.42 Si El Norte Fuera El Sur received multiple Platinum certifications in the United States43 and Argentina.44
In 1998, he released his seventh studio album, Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros. Terry Jenkins Allmusic review awarded the album 4 stars stating &quot;Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros continues Ricardo Arjona's streak of accomplished, affecting albums that spotlights both his melodic skills and his sharp social consciousness.&quot;45 His fourth consecutive album to receive critical success, Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros also enjoyed commercial success, debuting at #6 on Top Latin Albums, the first to reach the top 10.46 It also reached #3 on the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart.47 It contained the hit singles &quot;Dime Que No&quot; (#6 on Latin Songs, #3 on Latin Pop Songs), and &quot;Mentiroso&quot; (#22 on Latin Songs, #5 on Latin Pop Songs).4849 The album received multiple Platinum certifications from the United States50 and Argentina.51 More than 700,000 copies were sold.52

It produced the hit &quot;Desnuda&quot;, which became his first #1 on Top Latin Songs.54 As of December 2005, Vivo had sold 243,000 copies in the United States, his best-selling album there as of that date.55
2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2005: Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe, world tour, Santo Pecado, hiatus and Adentro
Arjona's eighth studio album, Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe was preceded by the single &quot;Cu&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndo&quot;, which became a commercial success and reached #1 on both Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs.5657 The singer commented that the album consumed twelve months and that before starting, &quot;he had more friends.&quot;58 He also mentioned he had &quot;lived in love with Caribbean culture and music since my childhood.&quot;59 Birchmeier awarded the album 3 stars stating &quot;All in all, Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe is a curious entry in Arjona's catalog that most fans can overlook without missing much.&quot;60 The album became his first to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at #136, while charting at #1 on Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums.616263 It was awarded Platinum certification in Mexico,64 Argentina65 and the US.66 Its three singles were &quot;Lo Poco Que Queda De Mi&quot;; &quot;Mes&lt;U+00ED&gt;as&quot;, which reached #19 on Top Latin Songs and #11 on the Latin Pop Songs chart; and &quot;A Cara O Cruz&quot;, which reached #28 on Latin Pop Songs.6768 To promote the album, which sold more than one million copies, Arjona embarked on his Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe Tour, which began in Mexico in 2000 and finished in 2001.697071
  On &quot;Mesias&quot; Arjona talks about a character who appears &quot;in the form of a wealthy, well-armed magnate with [...] some sinister plan for the world.&quot;72 Some critics argued that it was a &quot;metaphorical attack&quot; on capitalism and imperialism, named as &quot;classic Arjona targets.&quot;73 The song became a subject of some controversy when fans and critics noted connections between its theme and the attacks of September 2001, months after the song's release, which resulted in the FBI investigating Arjona.74 The singer later commented that &quot;Mes&lt;U+00ED&gt;as&quot; had no relationship to the attacks, and that the lyrics were pure coincidence.75 He further stated the FBI had never spoken directly to him, but instead to somebody on his team.76
On 19 November 2002, Arjona released his ninth studio album, Santo Pecado, preceded by singles &quot;El Problema&quot;, which reached #1 on both the Billboard Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts; and &quot;Minutos&quot; which reached #5 on the Top Latin Songs and #3 on the Latin Pop Songs charts.7778 Santo Pecado became a commercial success, selling more than 300,000 copies just in Mexico (double Platinum),79 160,000 in Argentina]] (quadruple Platinum)80 and 200,000 in the United States (double Platinum).81
In 2003 Arjona released Lados B, his second compilation album, including songs that were &quot;not so commercial&quot;, and that he wanted to give a second chance at radio airplay.82 The album contained songs from all his past studio albums. Critical reception for the album was mixed. Birchmeier noted that it was &quot;a misleading entry point into Arjona's catalog.&quot;83 Despite this, the album received a Gold certification in Mexico.84
On 6 December 2005, Arjona released his tenth studio album, Adentro. This was Arjona's first collaboration with Tommy Torres.85 In an interview, the singer commented that he first &quot;tested&quot; Torres by sending him the &quot;hookiest and darkest tracks&quot; on the album, &quot;Acompa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ame A Estar Solo&quot; and &quot;Iluso&quot;.86 Torres said that he &quot;went all out on the first demo, hiring a full band that included a string orchestra&quot;, which grabbed Arjona's attention.87 The album was critically acclaimed, with Evan C. Gutierrez from Allmusic giving it four stars out of five and commenting that &quot;Be it for the stripped, natural production value, the confident performance of Ricardo Arjona, or his relevant-as-ever lyricism, he's got both his loyal fans and the execs at Norte smiling. While the instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette of this project are minimalist and unassuming, there is a depth and brilliance to them. The listener's ear does not tire or want for more, humble as Adentro is.&quot;88 Arjona further commented that Adentro was &quot;a very representative and tremendously complete album,&quot; adding that &quot;having different producers made it rich in possibilities.&quot;89
Adentro became Arjona's second studio album to chart on the Billboard 200, reaching #126.90 It reached #3 on the Top Latin Albums and #2 on the Lain Pop Albums charts.9192 Five singles were released from Adentro: the lead single, &quot;Acompa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ame A Estar Solo&quot; (#7 on Latin Songs, #1 on Latin Pop Songs), &quot;Ping&lt;U+00FC&gt;inos En La Cama&quot; featuring Spanish singer Chenoa (#44 on Latin Songs, #19 on Latin Pop Songs); &quot;Mojado&quot;, featuring American Tejano/Norte&lt;U+00F1&gt;o band Intocable (#34 on Latin Songs, #30 on Latin Pop Songs), &quot;A Ti&quot; (#14 on Latin Songs, #3 on Latin Pop Songs) and &quot;De Vez En Mes&quot; (#49 on Latin Songs, #16 on Latin Pop Songs).9394 The album sold more than a million copies worldwide.95
2006&lt;U+2013&gt;2007: Adentro Tour and Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Dijo Ayer
In 2006, Arjona started the first leg of his world tour, named the Adentro Tour. The tour resumed in 2007 for a second leg, in which he visited more countries. Approximately, two million people attended the performances.a de Ricardo Arjona&quot;/&gt; The tour was officially closed on 14 September 2007 on the mainland city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela, during the International Fair, in front of more than 100,000 people.a de Ricardo Arjona&quot;/&gt;
On 21 August 2007, Arjona released his fifth compilation album, Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Dijo Ayer. The album is a two-disc set which contains, on the first disc, new versions of past hits, some of them including featured artists such as Marta S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez on &quot;Tarde (Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros)&quot; from Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros; Pante&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Rococ&lt;U+00F3&gt; on &quot;Si El Norte Fuera el Sur&quot;, from the album of the same name; Marc Anthony on &quot;Historia de Taxi&quot;, from Historias; Sandro on &quot;Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo&quot;, from Historias; and Eros Ramazzotti on &quot;A Ti&quot;, from Adentro. The second disc contained remastered versions of the hits on the first disc, but in their original versions. It was the second time Arjona collaborated with Torres.
The album became a critical and commercial success, with a positive Birchmeier review, who commented that &quot;while only a couple of the new versions depart stylistically from the originals, the contemporary productions breathe new life into these songs, which should be well known by longtime fans&quot;;96 and reaching double Platinum in Argentina97 and the United States,98 and Platinum in Mexico.99 Also, it went Gold in Colombia, Chile and Venezuela.100 Two singles were released from the album. The first, &quot;Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&quot;, a previously unreleased song and one of those produced by Torres, failed to reach the top 20 on Latin Songs, standing at #21, but reaching #4 on the Latin Pop Songs chart.101102 &quot;Quiero&quot;, the secong single, reached #12 on the Latin Songs chart, and #8 on the Latin Pop Songs chart.103104
2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010: New label, Quinto Piso, world tour and Poquita Ropa
 After spending the majority of his career with Sony, and Sony BMG, Arjona signed a long-term deal with Warner Music Latina in September 2008.105106 I&lt;U+00F1&gt;igo Zabala, chairman of Warner Music Latin America commented. &quot;He's an artist that fits perfectly with our company,&quot; and that &quot;We are a label that has a major catalog of songwriters and quality pop and rock from the likes of Man&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Alejandro Sanz, Laura Pausini, and now, Arjona.&quot;107
Arjona announced his eleventh studio album, 5to Piso, on 18 November 2008. The album was preceded by the first single, &quot;Como Duele&quot; on September, which reached #2 on Top Latin Songs and #1 on Latin Pop Songs.108109 He moved approximately 200,000 copies in the first month at retail and went Platinum in Mexico,110111112 the United States,113114 Spain, Argentina,115116Venezuela,117 Colombia, Guatemala, and several other countries.118 It debuted at #1 on Top Latin Albums, becoming his second chart-topper on that list, and sold more than one million copies worldwide.119120 The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album and a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Singer-Songwriter Album.121 The album received critical positive response. Birchmeier gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that &quot;More typical than exceptional for Arjona at this point in his career, 5to Piso isn't as grand an album as his past few, [...], Yet it's a great album all the same, particularly the opening run of songs that culminates with &quot;C&lt;U+00F3&gt;mo Duele&quot;, and it finds Arjona still at the top of his craft.&quot;122
While Warner Music released his new studio album, Sony Music released a compilation album, Simplemente Lo Mejor. This led to speculation that the labels were in a fight to win Arjona's fanbase and sales.123 Simplemente Lo Mejor contained hits from past albums, namely Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros, Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, among others. This compilation went Gold in Mexico,124 and Platinum in Argentina.125
&quot;Sin Ti... Sin Mi&quot; was released as 5to Piso's second single, and reached #4 on both Top Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs charts. On 24 April 2009, Arjona started the Quinto Piso Tour. The tour included 123 shows in the United States,126 Spain,127128 Argentina,129130 Guatemala, Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico, among many other countries in Latin America, and ended on 18 June 2010.
The Quinto Piso Tour was one of the most successful tours made by a Latin artist, with more than one million attendees from 19 countries.131 He received in 2010 the &quot;Latin Tour of the Year&quot; Billboard Latin Music Award for the tour.132 On 26 February 2010, he participated in the 2010 Vi&lt;U+00F1&gt;a del Mar International Song Festival as one of the top performers.133 His performance was followed by Colombian singer Fanny Lu. One hour after Lu's performance, a 8.8 magnitude massive earthquake affected the south-central regions of Chile. On social networks, Arjona was jokingly blamed, with remarks such as &quot;earthquakes go where he goes&quot;, making reference also to the earthquake felt in Mexico after the singer arrived.134135
After the tour, Arjona announced his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa, which was released on 24 August 2010.136 It was preceded by the genre-mixing track &quot;Puente&quot;, an ode to Havana, Cuba's largest and capital city.137 The song failed to break in the upper tier of Billboard charts, and was reportedly prohibited in Cuba.138 The album became his third to debut or reach #1 on the Top Latin Albums chart.139 Within two weeks of release, the album received a Gold certification in Chile, United States, Colombia and Puerto Rico; and Platinum certification in Mexico and Argentina.140
The album marked a change in Arjona's sound, which himself called a &quot;stripped-down version&quot; of his music.141 Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a &quot;stripped-down acoustic effort&quot; yet considering it &quot;impressive&quot;.142 Two more singles were released from Poquita Ropa, &quot;Vida&quot;, a song the singer dedicated to his recently dead father;143144 and &quot;Marta&quot;, an auto-biographical song whose music video stars Edith Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez.145 Both, like the lead single, failed to gain much airplay in the U.S., and charted poorly.
2011&lt;U+2013&gt;present: Independiente, Metamorfosis and world tour
Arjona released his thirteenth studio album, Independiente, on 4 October 2011. It became his fourth number-one set on Top Latin Albums when it debuted atop the chart for the week ending 22 October; and within a week went Gold in Chile, United States and Mexico; and Platinum in Venezuela and Argentina]].146 Independiente was his first release as an independent artist, appearing on his Metamorfosis label, a company he created to refocus his career.147 The album was distributed by Warner.148 Billboard noted that although other groups have decided to go independent after working with major record labels, Arjona was by far the most important artist in Latin pop to do so.149
The first single off Independiente was &quot;El Amor&quot;, released in 23 August.150 In the United States, the song reached #1 on Top Latin Songs, becoming his fourth number-one hit on that list,151 and #1 on Latin Pop Songs.152 It also became a hit in the rest of Latin America, reaching #1 in several countries.153 The second single off the album was &quot;Fuiste T&lt;U+00FA&gt;&quot;, a collaboration with Guatemalan singer Gaby Moreno. As of February 2012, the song reached the top 20 on Latin Songs, and #1 on the Latin Pop Songs.154155
The Metamorfosis World Tour,156157 began on 27 January 2012 in Toluca,158 where he he had launched all of his concert tours. The tour visited Latin America, North America and several countries in Europe.159
 In 22 March 2012, a controversy surrounded a supposed Iranian law that forbade Arjona's music,160 as disclosed by Venezuelan television channel Globovisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, and other regional newspapers.161162 This claim turned out to be false163 and Globovisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n later issued an apology.164 On 29 March, Billboard confirmed that Moreno had also signed with Metamorfosis.165 &quot;When I turned 17, I was signed by a very important label in the United States, [...], but I didn't feel comfortable when they told me which songs had to go into production&quot;, the singer said in a statement.166
Between 31 March and 1 April, Arjona toured Guatemala as part of world tour. The two concerts he presented in the Mateo Flores stadium were both sellouts, making Arjona the first artist in Guatemalan history to achieve this feat.167 On April 9, 2012, American telecommunications corporation AT&amp;T begun airing a commercial promoting the Nokia Lumia 900 smartphone, featuring the singer.168 Titled &quot;The Shoot&quot;, the spot shows how a teenage boy uses his Nokia smartphone to record Arjona's performance, and then showing it to his mother. It also features the song &quot;Mi Novia Se Est&lt;U+00E1&gt; Poniendo Vieja&quot; from the album Independiente, and was released on Mother's Day.169
As of 16 April 2012, the Metamorfosis World Tour had reached more than 400,000 fans, from which about 160,000 were just from his Buenos Aires tour dates on April 12&lt;U+2013&gt;15.170 On April 25, Arjona's show on Mendoza, Argentina had an attendance of 24,000 people, breaking the record set by Luis Miguel 10 years prior, and thus becoming the highest-grossing artist ever in that province.171 Hours before his performance on Mendoza, the Malvinas Argentinas stadium in which the concert was held, a fire burned close to one of the entries of the complex.172
Artistry
Music and style
 Arjona's primary musical style is Latin pop. Mainly, he sings without the help of featured or additional singers. His style varied over the years, as Arjona showed the confidence to take risks to keep his music from becoming stale. In contrast to the ballad-laden D&lt;U+00E9&gt;jame Decir Que Te Amo, on the latter two albums Arjona experimented with a range of pop/rock styles. Animal Nocturno intersperses energetic rock songs among heartfelt ballads, and the instrumentation is heavy on guitar, synthesizer, and drums.173 On Historias, each song is stylistically distinct and the instrumentation is varied. Around two dozen instruments were used on the album, including horns, piano and Hammond B-3, and strings.174 On Si El Norte Fuera El Sur, he crafted a relatively low-key effort characterized by intimate songs about love, culture, and politics. Most of the songs were written in 1995 while Arjona was touring175 and are performed acoustically with Caribbean touches. Besides a couple of rockers, the songs are fairly even in tone and tempo.176
In Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe, Arjona explored Afro-Caribbean sounds, employing traditional rhythms such as guaracha, bachata, merengue, and salsa.177 On Santo Pecado, Arjona explored the use of symphonic sounds on his ballads, amidst a couple of rock songs stylistically similar to those on Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros.178 This album included the song &quot;La Nena (Bit&lt;U+00E1&gt;cora de un Secuetro)&quot;, in which Arjona relates the story of a girl who is kidnapped by her uncle.179 Then, in 2005, Arjona adopted new sounds in Adentro. Gutierrez considered the instrumentation, performance, and overall sonic palette to be &quot;minimalist&quot; and &quot;unassuming&quot;.180 On this album, Arjona included more Latin sounds, Mexican and Tejano music on &quot;Mojado&quot;,181 a song about immigration;182 merengue and Colombian tones on &quot;Adi&lt;U+00F3&gt;s Melancol&lt;U+00ED&gt;a&quot;, and some on &quot;No Te Cambio Por Nada&quot;.
On 2007's Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Dijo Ayer, Arjona reworked past songs to fit a new style. For example, he gave &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot; a ska beat, and performed with the aid of Pante&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Rococ&lt;U+00F3&gt;.183 He transformed &quot;Historia de Taxi&quot; into a salsa song, with the help of American singer Marc Anthony184 and pianist Sergio George,185 who commented that &quot;It's been interesting to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music.&quot;186 He further stated that &quot;every time a reunion of this kind happens, it's a reason to celebrate.&quot;187 Birchmeier commented, &quot;While only a couple of the new versions depart stylistically from the originals, the contemporary productions breathe new life into these songs.&quot;188 &quot;Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo&quot; was re-recorded with singer Sandro. This turned out to be the last song recorded by the latter, who died 4 January 2010.189 This album included three new songs. The lead single, &quot;Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&quot; was written by Arjona and produced by himself and Torres.190 &quot;Quiero&quot; and &quot;Espantap&lt;U+00E1&gt;jaros&quot; are the other two new songs on the album.
 5to Piso is mainly driven by piano and strings.191 Exceptions are &quot;La Bailarina Vecina&quot;, crafted with pure orchestral arrangements; and &quot;Ni T&lt;U+00FA&gt; Ni Yo&quot;, a ranchera style song featuring Paquita la del Barrio.192 The album also includes a song called &quot;Que Nadie Vea&quot;, in which the artist sings about homosexuality.193 On 5to Piso, Arjona commented that he tried to recoup the freshness of his first albums, saying that he &quot;tried to reconcile a little with the Ricardo Arjona from the first albums to let out some of that freshness that makes so good to the songs.&quot;194
Poquita Ropa offered a drastic change in which Arjona minimized the number of instruments. The result was a set of a capella performances. Arjona commented about this album that &quot;music and women look better with little clothes.&quot;195 Production was handled by Arjona and Dan Warner, who also worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera.196 Birchmeier gave the album a somewhat positive review, saying that it was a &quot;stripped-down acoustic effort&quot;, considering it &quot;impressive&quot;.197 He also commented that Poquita Ropa &quot;finds Arjona at his most naked, backed by spare arrangements of acoustic guitar, piano, and Hammond B-3 along with occasional touches of strings, woodwinds, and chorus vocals.&quot;198
&quot;Puente&quot;, the lead single, is the only notable exception. It lasts eight and a half minutes and is divided in three parts. The first is sung mainly with a piano. The second part is a ballad with Caribbean and Latin sounds, with some salsa and Cuban influences.199 The third mixes salsa and merengue, with Cuban influences. &quot;Puente&quot; resembles Arjona's work on Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe.200 This album was the first since Adentro, that Arjona worked without Torres.
In Independiente, Arjona returned to his trademark sound, which Torres helped craft. David Feffries of Allmusic gave the album a somewhat positive review. He compared the production values and musical style of Independiente with those of past albums Animal Nocturno and Historias, stating, &quot;Returning fans will revel in this combination of freedom and growth, and appreciate the return of producer Tommy Torres, the man who has been behind the boards for quite a few of Arjona's most popular releases&quot;, referring precisely to the absence of Torres in the production of Poquita Ropa.201
Collaborators
Only longtime collaborators Dan Warner and Tommy Torres provided notable background vocals where needed. Five Arjona albums, including one compilation album, feature additional artists. Galer&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Caribe features vocals from artist Ednita Nazario on &quot;Porque Hablamos&quot;. Adentro features vocals from Spanish artist Chenoa on &quot;Ping&lt;U+00FC&gt;inos En La Cama&quot; and as well as American Tejano band Intocable on &quot;Mojado&quot;. The third album, Qui&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Dijo Ayer, features additional vocals from Marta S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez on &quot;Tarde (Sin Da&lt;U+00F1&gt;os a Terceros)&quot;; Pante&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Rococ&lt;U+00F3&gt; on &quot;Si El Norte Fuera El Sur&quot;; Marc Anthony on &quot;Historia de Taxi&quot;; Sandro on &quot;Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo&quot;; and Eros Ramazzotti on &quot;A Ti&quot;. The fourth is 5to Piso, on which Paquita la del Barrio collaborates on the track &quot;Ni T&lt;U+00FA&gt; Ni Yo&quot;. The fifth album is Independiente, in which Moreno starred alongside Arjona on &quot;Fuiste T&lt;U+00FA&gt;&quot;.
