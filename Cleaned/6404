Il Popolo d'Italia (&quot;The People of Italy&quot;), was an Italian newspaper founded by Benito Mussolini on November 15, 1914, as a result of his split with the Italian Socialist Party. Il Popolo d'Italia ran until July 24, 1943 and became the foundation for the Fascist movement in Italy after World War I. The paper, advocating militarism and irredentism, was subsidized by the French and industrialists on the pretext of influencing Italy to join the Entente Powers. This is also where Mussolini spread his ideas about how he wanted Italy to increase its birth rate. From 1936 to 1943 it was edited by Giorgio Pini.
