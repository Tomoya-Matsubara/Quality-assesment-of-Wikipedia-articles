For many years Hudson Place functioned similarly to Exchange Place farther down the Hudson waterfront as a terminus for many trolley lines which crisscrossed Hudson County. One of the few cobbled streets left within it, the streetcar tracks can still be seen.2 At one time more than ten lines operated by the Public Service Railway originated/terminated3, including the Hoboken Elevated. outside the train station. The last to depart was the #7 Jackson on August 7, 1949. The current bus terminal was built soon after bustitution was completed. 4
