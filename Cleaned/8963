Applied Physics Express or APEX is a scientific journal publishing letters, with usually no more than three pages per (concise) article. The main purpose is to rapidly publish original, timely, and novel research papers in applied physics. As part of its aim, the journal intends for papers to be novel research that has a strong impact on relevant fields and society. It is notable that the journal considers satisfaction of this criteria as showing the paper merits priority handling in the review and publication processes. In keeping with this aim, its issues are published online on a weekly basis. The print version is published monthly.12
The journal is the successor of the Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Part 2, i.e., the letter and express letter sections. The two editors-in-chief are Hitoshi Tabata (University of Tokyo) and Kouichi Ono (Kyoto University).
