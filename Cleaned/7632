Abraham Kurkindolle Allison (December 10, 1810 July 8, 1893) was a Florida businessman and politician. He served in the Florida Territorial Legislature and the Florida State House of Representatives. He served as the sixth Governor of Florida, at the end of the American Civil War.
Early life
Allison was born in Jones County, Georgia, on December 10, 1810, to Captain James and Sarah Allison. After he graduated from school, he worked as a merchant in Columbus, Georgia, and in Henry County, Alabama.1 He then moved to Apalachicola, Florida, where he served as the city's first mayor. He also served as the first county judge of Franklin County and as Clerk of the United States Court. He was a member of the Territorial Legislature. In the Seminole War, he was captain of the Franklin Rifles. He moved to Quncy in 1839 and there commenced the practice of law.2
Early political career
He was again elected to the Territorial Legislature, and represented Gadsden County in the State Legislature in 1845, 1847 and 1852. As Speaker of the House, he assumed the duties of acting Governor on September 16, 1853, because both Governor Thomas Brown and Senate President R. J. Floyd were out of the state. He gave up the office on the inauguration of James E. Broome on October 3. Allison did not exercise executive powers and merely held himself in readiness should a need arise.3
He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1861. He served during the Confederacy in the Florida State Senate from 1862 through 1864.4
Governorship and later life
After Governor John Milton committed suicide on April 1, 1865, Allison, as the state senate president, assumed the office of Governor. He resigned his office on May 19, 1865, and went into hiding the day before Federal troops formally occupied Tallahassee. He was captured by Union forces on June 19, 1865 and held for several months at Fort Pulaski.5 He returned to Quincy after his release. In 1872, he was convicted of &quot;intimidating Negroes&quot;, and was jailed again for six months and fined.6 He died in Quincy, Florida, on July 8, 1893.7
