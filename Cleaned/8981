The R512 is a Regional Route in South Africa. Its northern origin is Brits, North West, from which it leaves the R511 in a southerly direction. It meets, and is briefly co-signed with, the R104. It departs to the south, west of the Hartbeespoort Dam, where it gives off the south-westerly R560. It turns east briefly, along the southern edge of the dam, before again heading south, crossing into Gauteng. Passing Lanseria International Airport, the road then meets the R552 (Cedar Road), and forms and interchange with the N14. After crossing the highway and its old equivalent the R114, it heads towards Randburg part of Johannesburg Metropole as Malibongwe Drive. It passes through the lower-middle Cosmo City and Kya-Sand township before crossing the R562 and entering the more affluent Northriding and Olivedale suburbs. The R562 ends at an interchange with the N1, but Malibongwe Drive continues towards Johannesburg city centre.
