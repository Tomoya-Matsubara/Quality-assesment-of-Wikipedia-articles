New York State Route 239 (also known as NY 239) was a state highway in Erie County. It began at an intersection with New York State Route 354 in Cowlesville. The route headed northward, ending at U.S. Route 20 in Alden. The entirety of NY 239 was only about  in length. However, when first assigned in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering, NY 239 stretched into nearby Wyoming County. The route was truncated to NY 354 in Cowlesville, and was eventually decommissioned in September 1980, following a maintenance swap several months before. The designation was replaced by Erie County Route 578.

History
Route 239, when first assigned in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering,3 stretched from New York State Route 98 in Attica, a village in Wyoming County. The route used part of what is now New York State Route 354 through Cowlesville, beyond the county line and into Erie County. Route 239 then went northward along its truncated alignment to an intersection with New York State Route 35, where it terminated.4 Route 239 was eventually truncated and was on its current alignment by 1965.5
The highway lasted another 15 years, until the maintenance swaps between the state of New York and several different counties occurred in 1980. Several maintenance swaps between the state government and Erie County occurred on April 1. Six roads were turned over by Erie County to the state, and thirteen state highways turned over to the county.6 Route 239 ended up being one of the thirteen, being decommissioned completely on September 25 of that year.7 Erie County replaced the state designation of NY 239 with County Route 578, stretching from NY 354 to U.S. Route 20.8
