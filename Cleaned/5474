Bahia was the lead ship of a Bahia-class cruiser two-vessel class of cruisers built for Brazil by the British company Armstrong Whitworth. In November 1910, just six months after her Ship commissioning commissioning, crewmen aboard Bahia, ship Brazilian battleship Marechal Deodoro  2, ship Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes  2, and ship Brazilian battleship So Paulo  2 mutinied, beginning the lang pt Revolta da Chibata Revolt of the Lash. During the four-day rebellion, Brazil's capital city of Rio de Janeiro was held hostage by the possibility of a naval bombardment, leading the government to give in to the rebel demands, which included the abolition of Flagellation flogging in the navy. During the First World War, Bahia and her sister ship ship Brazilian cruiser Rio Grande do Sul  2 were assigned to the lang pt Diviso Naval em Operaes de Guerra Naval Division in War Operations, the Brazilian Navy's main contribution in that conflict. Based out of Sierra Leone and Dakar, the squadron escorted convoys through an area believed to be heavily patrolled by U-boats.
In the mid-1920s, Bahia was extensively modernized. She received three new John Brown & Company BrownCurtis turbine engines and six new Water-tube boiler#Thornycroft Thornycroft boilers, and, in the process, was converted from coal-burning to oil. The refit resulted in a striking aesthetic change, with the exhaust being trunked into three funnels instead of two. The armament was also modified; three convert 20 mm in abbr=on Madsen guns, a convert 7 mm in abbr=on Hotchkiss et Cie Hotchkiss machine gun, and four convert 533 mm in abbr=on torpedo tubes were added. In the 1930s, she served with government forces during multiple revolutions.
In the Second World War, Bahia was once again used as a convoy escort, sailing over convert 100000 nmi km mi in the span of about a year. On 4 July 1945 she was acting as a plane guard for Military transport aircraft transport aircraft flying from the Atlantic to Pacific theaters of war. While Bahia's gunners were firing at a kite for anti-aircraft practice, one aimed too low and hit depth charges stored near the stern of the ship, resulting in a massive explosion that incapacitated the ship and sank her within minutes. Only a small portion of the crew survived the blast, and even fewer were still living when their rafts were discovered days later.

Mutiny
Main Revolt of the Lash
:See also: South American dreadnought race#Brazilian naval revolt Brazilian naval revolt
Brazil's economy was suffering from a severe recession at the same time Bahia was commissioned.Smallman, Fear & Memory, 28. This economic hardship, along with the racism prevalent in all branches of the Brazilian armed forces, and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships, spawned a mutiny known as the lang pt Revolta da Chibata Revolt of the Whip among sailors on the most powerful ships.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 74.
Unhappy with the violent treatment they were receiving, black sailors on the dreadnought battleship ship Brazilian battleship Minas Geraes  2 began planning an uprising early in 1910, choosing Joo Cndido Felisberto  an experienced sailor later known as the Black Admiral  as their leader. In mid-November, a sailor was sentenced to be flogged in front of his fellow sailors, even though the practice had been banned by law. The punishment was administered and continued even after the sailor fainted, infuriating the nascent mutineers. Although they were not ready and could not revolt immediately, they quickened their preparations and rebelled on 21 November, earlier than originally planned. They killed several officers and the captain of Minas Geraes, while other officers were forced off the ship. The revolt quickly expanded to the battleship ship Brazilian battleship So Paulo  2, the elderly coastal defense ship ship Brazilian battleship Marechal Deodoro  2, and Bahia. While joining the revolt, the crew of the scout&nbsp;cruiser murdered one of their officers. During this time, discipline on the rebelling ships was not relaxed; daily drills were conducted and Felisberto ordered all liquor to be thrown overboard.
File:Joao Candido.jpg thumb left Joo Cndido Felisberto with reporters, officers and sailors on aboard Minas Geraes on 26 November 1910, the final day of the rebellion.
The crews of the torpedo boats remained loyal to the government, and army troops moved to the Catete Palace presidential palace and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the National Congress of Brazil to give in to the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26&nbsp;November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.
First World War
See also Brazil during World War I
In the opening years of the First World War, the Brazilian Navy was sent out to patrol the South Atlantic with French, British and American naval units, although its ships were not supposed to engage any threat outside territorial waters as Brazil was not at war with the Central Powers.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 35, 3738. The country also tried to ensure that it remained totally neutral; Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul were sent to Santos, So Paulo Santos in August 1914 to enforce neutrality laws when it was reported that the German raider SMS Bremen  2 was lying in wait off that port for British and American merchant ships.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F01E5D8113FE633A25754C0A96E9C946596D6CF Warships off Argentina, The New York Times, 7 August 1914, 7.#tag:ref The New York Times' article refers to SMS Bremen  2, but that ship was in the Baltic Sea at the time. The only German cruiser in that area in August 1914 was SMS Dresden 1907 2. The misidentification was probably due to the fog of war. group=upper-alpha Brazil joined the Allies of World War I Entente and declared war on the Central Powers on 26 October 1917.
On 21 December 1917, the Brazilian Navyat the behest of the Britishformed a small naval force with the intent of sending it to the other side of the Atlantic.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 38. On 30 January 1918, Bahia was made the flagship of the newly organized lang pt Diviso Naval em Operaes de Guerra Naval Division in War Operations, abbreviated as DNOG, under the command of Rear Admiral Pedro Max Fernando Frontin. The other ships assigned to the squadron were Bahia's sister Rio Grande do Sul, sclass- Par destroyer 1908 0 destroyers ship Brazilian destroyer Piau  2, ship Brazilian destroyer Paraba  2, ship Brazilian destroyer Rio Grande do Norte  2 and ship Brazilian destroyer Santa Catarina  2, Ship's tender tender ship Brazilian tender Belmonte  2, and tugboat Laurindo Pita.
The DNOG sailed for the British colony of Sierra Leone on 31 July. Since other allied countries helped with logistics, little was provided by Brazil aside from the ships themselves and the men crewing them. Despite the threat of a U-boat attack, they were forced to stop several times so Belmonte could transfer necessities such as coal and water to the other ships. They reached Freetown safely on 9 August and remained in the port until 23 August when they departed for Dakar. While on this section of the voyage, Bahia, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Norte, Belmonte and Laurindo Pita spotted an apparent torpedo heading for Belmonte, but it missed. Rio Grande do Norte then fired several shots and depth-charged what the force believed to be a U-boat.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 39. While the official Brazilian history of the ship definitively claims to have sunk a submarine, author Robert Scheina notes that this action was never confirmed, and works published about U-boat losses in the war do not agree.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 396.
After arriving in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, Cape Verde and Gibraltar; the Allies believed that this area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for naval mine mines laid by German minelaying submarines and to make sure that convoys passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condenser heat transfer condensers, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.
In early September, the squadron was struck by the 1918 flu pandemic Spanish flu pandemic. The contagion began aboard Bahia, spread to the other ships of the squadron and remained present for seven weeks. At one point, 95% of some of the ships' crews were infected; 103&nbsp;died overseas, and 250&nbsp;died in Brazil after returning there. On 3 November, Bahia, three of the four destroyers, and the tugboat were sent to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean Sea. They arrived on 9&nbsp;or 10 November,http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i3/israel.htm Israel, Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Naval History & Heritage Command/United States Department of the Navy Navy Department.#tag:ref Sources give different dates; the Navios de Guerra Brasileiros and Israel's Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships entry give 9 November, while Scheina gives 10 November. group=upper-alpha escorted by the American destroyer USS Israel DD-98 2, but the fighting ceased on the 11th when the Armistice with Germany was signed. Sometime in early 1919, Bahia, accompanied by four destroyers, voyaged to Portsmouth, England; they then traveled across the English Channel to Cherbourg, arriving there on 15 February.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D0CEFDC1139E13ABC4E52DFB4668382609EDE Brazilian Warships at Cherbourg, The New York Times, 16 February 1919, 23. The commander of the squadron, Admiral Pedro Max Fernando Frontin, met with the Maritime Prefect prior to the commencement of social events; these lasted until 23 February, when the ships moved to Toulon and Frontin journeyed overland to Paris. The DNOG was dissolved on 25 August 1919.
Modernization and inter-war years

In 192526,#tag:ref The official history of the ship gives a 19241927 range, while Scheina in Conway's, the Navios de Guerra Brasileiros, and Whitley give 19251926.Whitley, Cruisers of World War II, 22. Additional collaborating evidence for the latter date can be found in a June 1926 Ludington Daily News article which reported that Bahia was going to visit the United Statesimplying that the ship had been placed back into service. group=upper-alpha Bahia underwent significant modernization. The original five turbines were replaced by three John Brown & Company BrownCurtis turbines, while the original ten boilers were replaced by six Water-tube boiler#Thornycroft Thornycroft oil-burning boilers, which necessitated the addition of a third funnel. The former coal bunkers, along with some of the space freed up by the decrease in boilers, were converted to hold convert 588120 L USgal of oil. These modifications resulted in Bahia's top speed increasing to convert 28 kn km/h. All of the boats on board were replaced, and three Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon convert 20 mm in abbr=on Madsen guns, a convert 7 mm in abbr=on Hotchkiss et Cie Hotchkiss machine gun, and four convert 533 mm in abbr=on torpedo tubes were added to give the ship a defense against aircraft and more power against surface ships, respectively. Still, in 1930 The New York Times labeled Bahia and the other warships in Brazil's navy as obsolete and noted that nearly all were older than the ages considered effective by powers signatory to the Washington Naval Treaty Washington and London Naval Treaty London Naval Treaties.Brazil Navy Composed of 28 Obsolete Ships, The New York Times, 7 October 1930, 3.
On 28 June 1926, the Ludington Daily News reported that Bahia would pay a visit to Philadelphia, accepting an invitation from the United States government to participate in the Sesquicentennial Exposition sesquicentennial celebrations.Brazilian cruiser Will Pay Visit, Ludington Daily News, 28 June 1926, 5.#tag:ref There appears to have been no follow-up article on what occurred after Bahia arrived. group=upper-alpha In mid-1930, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sulunder the command of Herclito Belford Gomesescorted Brazil's President-elect Jlio Prestes to the United States.Program for Visit of Senor Prestes, The New York Times, 8 June 1930, 13.

The cruisers USS Trenton CL-11 6 and USS Marblehead CL-12 2 met the three ships about convert 100 mi km off of Sandy Hook and honored Prestes with a 21-gun salute.Cruisers meet Prestes's Ship, The New York Times, 11 June 1930, 16.Prestes Acclaimed by City and Nation, The New York Times, 12 June 1930, 21. After spending five hours in the Ambrose Channel due to fog, Prestes traveled on a launch to a pier, during which Bahia rendered one 21-gun salute and Fort Jay offered two. After arriving ashore, he traveled to New York City Hall City Hall before speeding down to Washington, D.C. He stayed in the United States for eight days before departing for France on the White Star Line's RMS Olympic  2.President-elect of Brazil at Sea, Pittsburgh Press, 21 June 1930, 2. Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul were berthed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard for the visit.
During the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, Bahia served with Rio Grande do Suluntil that ship defectedand five or six destroyers off the coast of Santa Catarina state Santa Catarina; they were once again commanded by Belford Gomes.Cavalry Put in Action as Battle Begins, Sarasota Herald, 10 October 1930, 2.#tag:ref Rio Grande do Sul defected at an unknown date, and Bahia may have as well; on 6 October, a rebel general claimed that both ships had defected.80,000 Rebels Move on Rio and Sao Paulo From the South, The New York Times, 7 October 1930, 1. group=upper-alpha Two years later, when the state of So Paulo state So Paulo rebelled in the Constitutionalist Revolution, Bahiaunder the command of Frigate Captain Lucas Alexandre Boiteuxand other vessels blockaded the rebel-held port of Santos.

Second World War
After Brazil's entrance into the Second World War on 21 August 1942, which took effect on 31 August,Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 164. Bahia was used extensively for escorts and patrols; sources conflict as to the actual numbereither 67 and 15 or 62 and 11. In total, she traveled convert 101971 nmi km mi abbr=on in 358 days, and played a role in shepherding over 700&nbsp;merchant ships, despite being labeled by the United States Naval Institute's magazine Proceedings magazine Proceedings as being an oversized destroyer which was relatively slow.Brazil, Proceedings magazine Proceedings 65 June 1939: 436; 901902; quoted in Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 164.
On 3 June 1943, while Bahia was escorting the convoy BT12, she located an naval mine underwater mine and destroyed it with one of her convert 20 mm in abbr=on Madsen guns. On 10 July, while at Coord 26 15 S 43 35 W, Bahia received a sonar contact and depth charge depth-charged what the Brazilian Navy's official history of the ship reports might have been the German submarine GS U-199  2, which was sunk later that month in the same area off Rio de Janeiro by American and Brazilian aircraft.http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b2/barnegat-ii.htm Barnegat, Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, Naval History & Heritage Command/Navy Department. In November 1944, Bahia joined the American light cruiser USS Omaha CL-4 2 and destroyer escort USS Gustafson DE-182 2 in accompanying the 4th Squadron of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force as they were carried on the troop transport USS General M. C. Meigs AP-116 2 to Italy.
Bahia was modernized again twice during the war, in both 1942 and 1944; these modernizations were not as extensive as those of the 1920s. Two of her QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss convert 47 mm in abbr=on guns were replaced with convert 76 mm in abbr=on L/23 AA guns, her Madsen guns were replaced with seven Oerlikon 20 mm cannon Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm cannons in single mounts, and a fire-control system director for these guns was installed. Two depth charge tracks were added, improved range-finders were added to the convert 120 mm in abbr=on guns, and sonar and radar were fitted, in addition to other minor modifications.Regarding the installation of sonar, it is not clear whether it was fitted for the first time in 1942 and used in the 10 July depth charging or whether a more modern sonar replaced an outmoded version in either 1942 or 1944. The Brazilian Navy's official history of the ship reports these modifications, but does not specify which were undertaken in which year.

At the end of hostilities in the European Theatre of World War II European theater in May 1945 various warships of the Allied nations, including Brazil's, were assigned to patrol in the Atlantic as rescue ships, standing by near routes frequented by military transport aircraft carrying personnel from Europe to the continuing Pacific Theater of Operations war in the Pacific.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 169. Bahia was one such ship; on 4 July 1945, she was stationed northeast of Brazil around Coord 0 N 30 W, near the lang pt Arquiplago de So Pedro e So Paulo Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago. For anti-aircraft target practice, crewmen were firing the ship's 20&nbsp;mm guns at a kite that was being towed behind the ship. One of them shot it down, but also accidentally hit the depth charges on the sterna direct consequence of the lack of guide rails that would normally prohibit the guns from being aimed at the ship.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 427. The resulting explosion knocked out all power on the ship and sank her in about three minutes.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803597,00.html Brazil: Disaster, Time, 23 July 1945.
