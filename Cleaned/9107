Aim&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Antoinette Camus (1897-1965) was a French botanist. She was best known for her study of orchids.
Camus was the daughter of Edmond Gustave Camus, also a botanist and was born in L'Isle-Adam, about 50 kilometres north of Paris. Under her father's influence she specialized in the study of orchids and the anatomy of the plant and worked for some time with other professionals such as Paul Bergon and Paul Henri Lecomte. 1
Camus published the work &quot;L'Iconographie des Orchid&lt;U+00E9&gt;es d&lt;U+00B4&gt;Europe et du Bassin M&lt;U+00E9&gt;diterran&lt;U+00E9&gt;en&quot;.
