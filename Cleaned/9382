Bangalore , also known as Benga&lt;U+1E37&gt;&lt;U+016B&gt;ru (Kannada: &lt;U+0CAC&gt;&lt;U+0CC6&gt;&lt;U+0C82&gt;&lt;U+0C97&gt;&lt;U+0CB3&gt;&lt;U+0CC2&gt;&lt;U+0CB0&gt;&lt;U+0CC1&gt;, ) , is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. Bangalore is nicknamed the Silicon Valley of India, Silicon City of India, Garden City, Metropolitan City, India's Most Expensive City, IT/BT Capital Of India. Located on the Deccan Plateau in the south-eastern part of Karnataka, Bangalore is India's third most populous city6 and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration.
Though historical references to the city predate 900 AD, a modern written history of continuous settlement exists only from 1537, when Kempe Gowda, who many regard as the architect of modern Bangalore, built a mud-brick fort at the site and established it as a province of the imperial Vijayanagara Empire. During the British Raj, it became a centre of colonial rule in South India. The establishment of the Bangalore Cantonment brought in large numbers of migrants from other parts of the country.
Today as a large city and growing metropolis, Bangalore is home to many of the most well-recognized colleges and research institutions in India. Numerous public sector heavy industries, software companies, aerospace, telecommunications, and defence organisations are located in the city. Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India because of its position as the nation's leading IT exporter.789 A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is a major economic and cultural hub and the fastest growing major metropolis in India.10
Etymology
The name Bangalore is an anglicised version of the town's name in the Kannada language, Benga&lt;U+1E37&gt;&lt;U+016B&gt;ru. The earliest reference to the name &quot;Bengaluru&quot; was found in a ninth century Western Ganga Dynasty stone inscription on a &quot;v&lt;U+012B&gt;ra gallu&quot; () (literally, &quot;hero stone&quot;, a rock edict extolling the virtues of a warrior). In this inscription found in Begur, &quot;Bengaluru&quot; is referred to as a place in which a battle was fought in 890. It states that the place was part of the Ganga Kingdom until 1004 and was known as &quot;Bengaval-uru&quot;, the &quot;City of Guards&quot; in Halegannada (Old Kannada.11 An article, published in The Hindu, states:
An inscription, dating back to 890 CE, shows Bangalore is over 1,000 years old. But it stands neglected at the Parvathi Nageshwara Temple in Begur near the city... written in Hale Kannada (Old Kannada) of the 9th century CE, the epigraph refers to a Bengaluru war in 890 in which Buttanachetty, a servant of Nagatta, died. Though this has been recorded by historian R. Narasimhachar in his Epigraphia of Carnatica (Vol. 10 supplementary), no efforts have been made to preserve it.12
An apocryphal, though popular, anecdote recounts that the 11th-century Hoysala king Veera Ballala II, while on a hunting expedition, lost his way in the forest. Tired and hungry, he came across a poor old woman who served him boiled beans. The grateful king named the place &quot;benda-kaal-uru&quot; () (literally, &quot;town of boiled beans&quot;), which eventually evolved into &quot;Bengal&lt;U+016B&gt;ru&quot;.1314
On 11 December 2005, the Government of Karnataka announced that it had accepted a proposal by Jnanpith Award winner U. R. Ananthamurthy to rename Bangalore to Bengaluru.15 On 27 September 2006, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) passed a resolution to implement the proposed name change,16 which was accepted by the Government of Karnataka and it was decided to officially implement the name change from 1 November 2006.1718 However, this process has been currently stalled due to delays in getting clearances from the Union Home Ministry.19
History
  After centuries of the rule of the Western Gangas, Bangalore was captured by the Cholas in 1024 AD which later passed on to the Chalukya-cholas in 1070. In 1116 the Hoysala Empire, overthrew the Cholas and extended its rule over Bangalore. Modern Bangalore was founded by a vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda I, who built a mud-brick fort and a Nandi Temple in the proximity of modern Bangalore in 1537. Yelahanka is one of the oldest towns in Karnataka and it is believed that it has a history of more than 500 years. It is the home town for the ruling king called Kempegowda (under a provision given by Krishnadevaraya) who built Bangalore City. Kempe Gowda referred to the new town as his &quot;gandubh&lt;U+016B&gt;mi&quot; or &quot;Land of Heroes&quot;.20
Within Bangalore Fort, the town was divided into smaller divisions &lt;U+2013&gt; each called a &quot;pete&quot; (). The town had two main streets &lt;U+2013&gt; Chikkapete Street, which ran east-west, and Doddapete Street, which ran north-south. Their intersection formed the Doddapete Square &lt;U+2014&gt; the heart of Bangalore. Kempe Gowda's successor, Kempe Gowda II, built four famous towers that marked Bangalore's boundary. Myth says that the city would befall great calamity if it extended beyond these four towers.21 During the Vijayanagara rule, Bangalore was also referred to as &quot;Devar&lt;U+0101&gt;yanagara&quot; and &quot;Kaly&lt;U+0101&gt;napura&quot; (&quot;Auspicious City&quot;).  After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Bangalore's rule changed hands several times. In 1638, a large Bijapur army led by Ranadulla Khan and accompanied by Shahji Bhonsle defeated Kempe Gowda III and Bangalore was given to Shahaji as a jagir. In 1687, the Mughal general Kasim Khan defeated Ekoji I/Venkoji, son of Shahaji, and then sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673&lt;U+2013&gt;1704) of Mysore for 300,000 rupees.2223 After the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II in 1759, Hyder Ali, Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, proclaimed himself the de facto ruler of Mysore. The kingdom later passed to Hyder Ali's son Tippu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore.
Bangalore was eventually incorporated into the British Indian Empire after Tippu Sultan was defeated and killed in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799). The British returned administrative control of the Bangalore &quot;p&lt;U+0113&gt;t&lt;U+0113&gt;&quot; to the Maharaja of Mysore, choosing only to retain the Cantonment under their jurisdiction. The 'Residency' of Mysore State was first established at Mysore in 1799 and later shifted to Bangalore in the year 1804. It was abolished in the year 1843 only to be revived in 1881 at Bangalore and to be closed down permanently in 1947, with Indian independence. The British, found it easier to recruit employees in the Madras Presidency and relocate them to cantonment area during this period. The Kingdom of Mysore relocated its capital from Mysore city to Bangalore in 1831.24 Two important developments during this period contributed to the rapid growth of the city: the introduction of telegraph connections and a rail connection to Madras in 1864. 
In the 19th century, Bangalore essentially became a Twin city, with the &quot;p&lt;U+0113&gt;t&lt;U+0113&gt;&quot;, whose residents were predominantly Kannadigas, and the &quot;cantonment&quot; created by the British, whose residents were predominantly Tamils.25 Bangalore was hit by a plague epidemic in 1898 that dramatically reduced its population. New extensions in Malleshwara and Basavanagudi were developed in the north and south of the p&lt;U+0113&gt;t&lt;U+0113&gt;. Telephone lines were laid to help co-ordinate anti-plague operations, and a health officer was appointed to the city in 1898. In 1906, Bangalore became the first city in India to have electricity, powered by the hydroelectric plant situated in Shivanasamudra. Bangalore's reputation as the Garden City of India began in 1927 with the Silver Jubilee celebrations of the rule of Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. Several projects such as the construction of parks, public buildings and hospitals were instituted to beautify the city. After Indian independence in August 1947, Bangalore remained in the new Mysore State of which the Maharaja of Mysore was the Rajapramukh.
Public sector employment and education provided opportunities for Kannadigas from the rest of the state to migrate to the city. Bangalore experienced rapid growth in the decades 1941&lt;U+2013&gt;51 and 1971&lt;U+2013&gt;81 , which saw the arrival of many immigrants from northern Karnataka. By 1961, Bangalore had become the sixth largest city in India, with a population of 1,207,000.26 In the decades that followed, Bangalore's manufacturing base continued to expand with the establishment of private companies such as Motor Industries Company (MICO; a subsidiary of Robert Bosch GmbH), which set up its manufacturing plant in the city. Bangalore experienced a growth in its real estate market in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by capital investors from other parts of the country who converted Bangalore's large plots and colonial bungalows into multi-storied apartments.27 In 1985, Texas Instruments became the first multinational corporation to set up base in Bangalore. Other information technology companies followed suit and by the end of the 20th century, Bangalore had firmly established itself as the Silicon Valley of India.
Geography
 Bangalore lies in the southeast of the South Indian state of Karnataka. It is in the heart of the Mysore Plateau (a region of the larger Precambrian Deccan Plateau) at an average elevation of 920 m (3,018 ft). It is positioned at  and covers an area of 741 km&lt;U+00B2&gt; (286 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt;).28 The majority of the city of Bangalore lies in the Bangalore Urban district of Karnataka and the surrounding rural areas are a part of the Bangalore Rural district. The region consisting the Bangalore Urban and Rural districts is known as the Bangalore (region). The Government of Karnataka has carved out the new district of Ramanagara from the old Bangalore Rural district.
The topology of Bangalore is flat except for a central ridge running NNE-SSW. The highest point is Vidyaranyapura Doddabettahalli, which is 962 m (3,156 ft) and lies on this ridge.29 No major rivers run through the city, though the Arkavathi and South Pennar cross paths at the Nandi Hills, 60 km (37 mi.) to the north. River Vrishabhavathi, a minor tributary of the Arkavathi, arises within the city at Basavanagudi and flows through the city. The rivers Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi together carry much of Bangalore's sewage. A sewerage system, constructed in 1922, covers 215 km&lt;U+00B2&gt; (133 mi&lt;U+00B2&gt;) of the city and connects with five sewage treatment centers located in the periphery of Bangalore.30
In the 16th century, Kempe Gowda I constructed many lakes to meet the town's water requirements. The Kempambudhi Kere, since overrun by modern development, was prominent among those lakes. In the earlier half of 20th century, the Nandi Hills waterworks was commissioned by Sir Mirza Ismail (Diwan of Mysore, 1926&lt;U+2013&gt;41 CE) to provide a water supply to the city. Currently, the river Kaveri provides around 80% of the total water supply to the city with the remaining 20% being obtained from the Thippagondanahalli and Hesaraghatta reservoirs of the Arkavathi river.31 Bangalore receives 800 million litres (211 million US gallons) of water a day, more than any other Indian city.32 However, Bangalore sometimes does face water shortages, especially during the summer season- more so in the years of low rainfall. A random sampling study of the Air Quality Index (AQI) of twenty stations within the city indicated scores that ranged from 76 to 314, suggesting heavy to severe air pollution around areas of traffic concentration.33
Bangalore has a handful of freshwater lakes and water tanks, the largest of which are Madivala tank, Hebbal lake, Ulsoor lake and Sankey Tank. Groundwater occurs in silty to sandy layers of the alluvial sediments. The Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) is the most dominant rock unit in the area and includes granites, gneisses and migmatites, while the soils of Bangalore consist of red laterite and red, fine loamy to clayey soils.34
Vegetation in the city is primarily in the form of large deciduous canopy and minority coconut trees. Though Bangalore has been classified as a part of the seismic zone II (a stable zone), it has experienced quakes of magnitude as high as 4.5.35
Climate
Bangalore experiences a tropical savanna climate (K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification Aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons. Due to its high elevation, Bangalore usually enjoys a more moderate climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can make things very uncomfortable in the summer.36 The coolest month is January with an average low temperature of 15.1 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of 33.6 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C.37 The highest temperature ever recorded in Bangalore is 38.9 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C(recorded in March 1931) and the lowest ever is 7.8 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (recorded in January 1884).3839 Winter temperatures rarely drop below 12 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (54 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F), and summer temperatures seldom exceed 36&lt;U+2013&gt;37 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (100 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F). Bangalore receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest monsoons and the wettest months are September, October and August, in that order.40 The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages and local flooding. The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period is  recorded on 1 October 1997.41
Civic Administration

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, Greater Bangalore Municipal Corporation) is in charge of the civic administration of the city.42 It was formed in 2007 by merging 100 wards of the erstwhile Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, with seven neighbouring City Municipal Councils, one Town Municipal Council and 110 villages around Bangalore.43 The BBMP is run by a city council composed of 250 members, including 198 councillors representing each of the wards of the city and 52 other elected representatives, consisting of members of Parliament and the state legislature.44 Elections to the council are held once every five years, with results being decided by popular vote. Members contesting elections to the council usually represent one of more of the state's political parties. A mayor and deputy mayor are also elected from among the elected members of the council.45 Elections to the BBMP were held on March 28, 2010, after a gap of three and a half years since the expiry of the previous elected body's term, and the Bharatiya Janata Party was voted into power &lt;U+2013&gt; the first time it had ever won a civic poll in the city.46
Bangalore's rapid growth has created several problems relating to traffic congestion and infrastructural obsolescence that the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has found challenging to address. A 2003 Battelle Environmental Evaluation System (BEES) evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were close to ideal, while the city's socioeconomic parameters (traffic, quality of life) scored poorly.47 The unplanned nature of growth in the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic.48 In 2005 both the Central Government and the State Government allocated considerable portions of their annual budgets to address Bangalore's infrastructure.49 The BBMP works with the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the Agenda for Bengaluru Infrastructure and Development Task Force (ABIDe) to design and implement civic projects. Bangalore generates about 3,000 tonnes of solid waste per day, of which about 1,139 tonnes are collected and sent to composting units such as the Karnataka Composting Development Corporation. The remaining solid waste collected by the municipality is dumped in open spaces or on roadsides outside the city.50
The Bangalore City Police (BCP) has six geographic zones, includes the Traffic Police, the City Armed Reserve, the Central Crime Branch and the City Crime Record Bureau and runs 86 police stations, including two all-women police stations.51 As capital of the state of Karnataka, Bangalore houses important state government facilities such as the Karnataka High Court, the Vidhana Soudha (the home of the Karnataka state legislature) and Raj Bhavan (the residence of the Governor of Karnataka). Bangalore contributes three members to India's lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, and 28 members to the Karnataka State Assembly.52
Electricity in Bangalore is regulated through the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM),53 while water supply and sanitation facilities are provided by the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB).54
Economy
 Bangalore's INR 260,260 crore economy (2002&lt;U+2013&gt;03 Net District Income) makes it a major economic centre in India.55 With an economic growth of 10.3%, Bangalore is the fastest growing major metropolis in India.56 Additionally, Bangalore is India's fourth largest fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market.57 The city is the third largest hub for high net worth individuals and is home to over 10,000 dollar millionaires and about 60,000 super-rich people who have an investable surplus of  and  respectively.58 As of 2001, Bangalore's share of  in Foreign Direct Investment was the fourth highest for an Indian city.59
In the 1940s, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mirza Ismail and Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya born in nearby Muddenahalli played an important role in the development of Bangalore's strong manufacturing and industrial base.
The headquarters of Infosys, India's second largest IT company, is located in Bangalore
The headquarters of several public sector undertakings such as Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) and Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) are located in Bangalore. In June 1972 the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was established under the Department of Space and headquartered in the city.
Bangalore is called the Silicon Valley of India because of the large number of information technology companies located in the city which contributed 33% of India's  IT exports in 2006-07.60 Bangalore's IT industry is divided into three main clusters &lt;U+2014&gt; Software Technology Parks of India (STPI); International Tech Park, Bangalore (ITPB); and Electronics City. UB City, the headquarters of the United Breweries Group, is a high-end commercial zone.61 Infosys and Wipro, India's second and third largest software companies are headquartered in Bangalore, as are many of the global SEI-CMM Level 5 Companies.
The growth of IT has presented the city with unique challenges. Ideological clashes sometimes occur between the city's IT moguls, who demand an improvement in the city's infrastructure, and the state government, whose electoral base is primarily the people in rural Karnataka.62 The encouragement of high-tech industry in Bangalore, for example, has not favoured local employment development, but has, instead, increased land values and forced out small enterprise.63 Bangalore is a hub for biotechnology related industry in India and in the year 2005, around 47% of the 265 biotechnology companies in India were located here; including Biocon, India's largest biotechnology company.6465
Transport
The new Bengaluru International Airport is located in Devanahalli.
Air
Bangalore is served by the newly built Bengaluru International Airport (IATA code: BLR) which started operations from 24 May 2008. The city was earlier served by the HAL Airport which was India's fourth busiest airport.666768 Air Deccan and Kingfisher Airlines have their headquarters in Bangalore.69 It is now the fourth busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic and the number of air traffic movements (ATMs) with about 280 per day.
Rail
A rapid transit system called the Namma Metro is being developed and is expected to be operational by 201070. Once completed, this will encompass a  elevated and underground rail network comprising 41 stations. It is expected to connect central locations in Bangalore to Devanahalli and the Chikballapur regions.71 72 Bangalore comes under the South Western Railway zone of the Indian Railways. Bangalore City Railway station and Yesvantpur Junction connect it to the rest of the country through the Indian Railways. The Rajdhani Express connects the city to New Delhi, the capital of India. Bangalore is also connected by rail to most cities in Karnataka, as well as Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Mysore and other major cities in India.73 The sprawling Rail Wheel Factory is Asia's second largest manufacturer of Wheel &amp; Axle for Railways and headquartered in Yelahanka, Bangalore. 
Road
Three-wheeled, black and yellow auto-rickshaws, referred to as autos, are a popular form of transport.74 They are metered and can accommodate up to three passengers. Taxi service within Bangalore is provided by several operators. The taxis are commonly called City Taxis, and are usually available only on call. Taxis are metered and are generally more expensive than auto-rickshaws.75
Buses operated by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) are also a means of public transport available in the city, and are highly reliable.76 While commuters can buy tickets on boarding these buses, BMTC also provides an option of a bus pass to frequent users. BMTC also runs air-conditioned luxury buses on major routes.77 BMTC also operates Vayu Vajra Airport Service (city to International Airport). Vajra and BIG 10 and Tata Marcopolo(A/C Volvo on city routes), Suvarna and Pushpak(Non A/C city routes). Bus Timings are available.78 The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operates 6,918 buses on 6,352 schedules, connecting Bangalore with other parts of Karnataka as well as other states. The main bus depots that BMTC maintains are the Kempegowda Bus Station (popularly known as Majestic), Shantinagar Bus Depot, and Shivajinagar Bus Depot.

Education
  Until the early 19th century, education in Bangalore was mainly run by religious leaders and restricted to students of that religion.101 The western system of education was introduced during the rule of Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar, when two schools were established in Bangalore. Subsequently, Wesleyan Mission established a school in 1851 and the Bangalore High School which was started by the Government in 1858.102
In post-independent India, schools for young children are mainly based on the kindergarten form of education.103 Primary and secondary education in Bangalore is offered by various schools which are affiliated to one of the boards of education, such as the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC), ICSE, CBSE and NIOS.104 Schools in Bangalore are either government run or are private (both aided and un-aided by the government).105 After completing their secondary education, students either attend Pre University (PUC) or continue High School in one of three streams &lt;U+2013&gt; Arts, Commerce or Science.106 Upon completing the required coursework, students enroll in general or professional degrees in universities.

The first printing-press was established in Bangalore in the year 1840.110 In 1859, Bangalore Herald became the first English bi-weekly newspaper to be published in Bangalore111 and in 1860, Mysore Vrittanta Bodhini became the first Kannada newspaper to be circulated in Bangalore.112 Currently, Vijaya Karnataka and The Times of India are the most widely circulated Kannada and English newspapers in Bangalore respectively, closely followed by the Prajavani and Deccan Herald both owned by the Printers (Mysore) Limited - the largest print media house in Karnataka.113114
Bangalore got its first radio station when All India Radio, the official broadcaster for the Indian Government, started broadcasting from its Bangalore station on 2 November 1955.115 The radio transmission was AM, until in 2001, Radio City became the first private channel in India to start transmitting FM radio from Bangalore.116 In recent years, a number of FM channels have started broadcasting from Bangalore.117 The city also has India's Oldest Amateur (Ham) Radio Club - Bangalore Amateur Radio Club VU2ARC 118119 celebrating its Golden Jubilee along with Hamfest India HFI 2009 this November 120 amongst various clubs for HAM radio enthusiasts.121
Bangalore has a number of newspapers and magazines that cater to the varied interests. Magazines like Open and 080 cater to lifestyle, citizen issues and fashion, newspapers like Mid-Day and Vijay Karnataka provide localised news updates. On the web (as Bangalore is the silicon city of India), Explocity provides listings information, while My Bangalore is more news centric.
Bangalore got its first look at television when Doordarshan established a relay centre here and started relaying programs from 1 November 1981.122 A production center was established in the Doordarshan's Bangalore office in 1983, thereby allowing the introduction of a news program in Kannada on 19 November 1983.123 Doordarshan also launched a Kannada satellite channel on 15 August 1991 which is now christened DD Chandana.124 The advent of private satellite channels in Bangalore started in September 1991 when Star TV started to broadcast its channels.125 Though the number of satellite TV channels available for viewing in Bangalore has grown over the years,126 the cable operators play a major role in the availability of these channels, which has led to occasional conflicts.127 Direct To Home services are also available in Bangalore now.128
The first internet service provider in Bangalore was STPI, Bangalore which started offering internet services in early 1990s.129 This internet service was however restricted to corporates, until VSNL started offering dial-up internet services to the general public at the end of 1995.130 Currently, Bangalore has the largest number of broadband internet connections in India.131
