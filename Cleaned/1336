The 2014 Venezuela protests (also called 12F1 and The Exit2) are a series of protests against the socialist government of Venezuela led by president Nicol&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Maduro, began on February 12, 2014, organized by the leaders of the Venezuelan opposition Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Corina Machado and Leopoldo L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez3 and organized together with student movements. The alleged motivation of the protesters is the discontent before what they consider the violation of civil rights, chronic scarcity of goods, and high levels of criminal violence. The inflation for the previous year was 56.2%, the scarcity index had been near 20% throughout 2013 and a person is murdered every 21 minutes in Venezuela.456
The day chosen for the call of civil disobedience coincides with the commemoration of the Battle of La Victoria of 12 February, 1814 during the Venezuelan War of Independence, when the independence forces armed thousands of college and seminary students in the shortage of troops. This day is also known in Venezuela as Youth Day.
The presidential candidate of the MUD, Henrique Capriles, has remained at the margin of the initiative of civil disobedience, only supporting peaceful protests. 7
Contested legitimacy of the government
President Maduro won the election by a tight margin, with an alleged and unverifiable 1.5% of the vote separating him from the second candidate. The election was seeded with accusations of fraud and intimidation of voters,8 and a recount of the votes was demanded 9 by the opposition leader Henrique Capriles, and denied 10 by the electoral council.
Government response
According to the government the protesters want to repeat the Venezuelan coup of 2002.11
Maduro's government organized pro-government demonstrations as well and announced that the anti-government protests remained prohibited. 12 This was because Venezuelan legislation requires a previous municipal permit for any public protest. The GNB, SEBIN, and pro-government gangs responded to the protest violently with firearms and in some cases the military even used assault vehicles to fire on students.131415 The government also blocked images on Twitter showing evidence of students being shot in the back while fleeing, torture and even more injuries.1617 Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler confirmed that Venezuela's government blocked the images.18 Both protests were made in various parts of the country, and so far four people have been killed19 and 66 injured. The government recalled that the means of the transmission of images of violent protests in the media in the face of the law of communication of Venezuela (Law of Social Responsibility on Radio and Television) is prohibited, the cable signal of the international channel NTN24 was blocked in the country according to the government because of transmitting messages that incited to violence without the knowledge of the authorities, confirmed by president Maduro himself, who also noted the international agency AFP of being the head of a media manipulation. 20
The deaths caused in the first demonstration led to further demonstrations, both opposing and supporting Maduro.21
International reactions
 Many human rights groups and nations have been worried about the growing situation and use of excessive force in Venezuela. United States Secretary of State John Kerry expressed concern over the crackdown on peaceful protestors that were only expressing their rights and expressed grievances for the families suffering there.22 The United Nations is urging a probe into human rights violations performed by the government claiming that children were detained and separated from family, the media was threatened and had equipment taken away, and armed government groups acting with impunity firing on peaceful demonstrators.23 The European Union asked for peace from Venezuelan authorities because freedom of expression is an necessary human right.24 Amnesty International a human rights group has asked for the government to investigate the deaths and has condemned the government's actions saying that if they truly wanted to stop violence in Venezuela, they would not have expressed violence on peaceful protestors. They believe that protestors should have their freedom of speech and not have to fear of being detained, abused or even murdered.25
However, the socialist governments of Argentina,26 Bolivia,27 Ecuador,28 Cuba29 and Nicaragua30 that are allied with the Maduro government have condemned the demonstrations, considered them undemocratic and called for solidarity with the government of Maduro. The support to Maduro voiced by the government of Argentina as heavily criticized by Laura Alonso, deputee of the opposing party Republican Proposal.31
