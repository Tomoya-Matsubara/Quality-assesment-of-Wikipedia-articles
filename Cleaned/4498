Cindy Lou Hensley McCain (born May 20, 19541) is an American businessperson and philanthropist, and the wife of United States Senator and 2000 and 2008 presidential candidate John McCain of Arizona. She is chair of Hensley &amp; Co.,23 founded by her father and one of the largest Anheuser-Busch beer distributors in the United States.4
She founded and ran a non-profit organization, the American Voluntary Medical Team, from 1988 to 1995 that organized trips by medical personnel to disaster-struck or war-torn third-world areas. She continues to be an active philanthropist and serves on the boards of several charitable organizations.
Early life and education
Cindy Lou Hensley was born in Phoenix, Arizona,5 to James Hensley, who founded Hensley &amp; Co. in 1955,6 and Marguerite &quot;Smitty&quot; Hensley (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Johnson).789 She was raised as the only child of her parents' second marriages10 and grew up on Phoenix's North Central Avenue in affluent circumstances.111213 (Dixie L. Burd, who is the daughter of Marguerite Smith through a prior relationship, is her half-sister,14 as is Kathleen Hensely Portalski, daughter of Jim Hensley and his first wife, Mary Jeanne Parks.1516) Cindy Hensley was named Junior Rodeo Queen of Arizona in 1968.1718 She went to Central High School19 in Phoenix, where she was named Best Dressed as a senior and graduated in 1972.2021
Hensley received a Bachelor of Arts in education from the University of Southern California,2223 where she was a cheerleader 2425 and joined the socially conservative Kappa Alpha Theta sorority as a freshman.2627 She continued on at USC, and received a Master of Arts in special education in 1978.2829 There she participated in a movement therapy pilot program that laid the way for a standard treatment for children with severe disabilities;30 she published the work Movement Therapy: A Possible Approach in 1978.31 Declining a role in the family business,32 she worked for a year as a special education teacher working with children with Down syndrome and other disabilities at Agua Fria High School in Avondale, Arizona.33343536
Marriage and family
 Hensley met John McCain in April 1979 at a military reception in Hawaii.37 He was the U.S. Navy liaison officer to the United States Senate, almost eighteen years her senior.38 McCain and Hensley quickly began a relationship,39 traveling between Arizona and Washington to see each other.40 John McCain pushed to end his marriage of fourteen years;41 Carol McCain and John McCain stopped cohabiting in January 1980,42 and Carol accepted a divorce in February 1980,43 effective in April 1980. John and Cindy were married on May 17, 1980 at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix.44 They made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name;45 they have since kept their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.46
Her father's business and political contacts helped gain her husband a foothold in Arizona politics.47 She campaigned with her husband door-to-door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982,48 and was heavily involved in campaign strategy.49 Her wealth from an expired trust from her parents provided significant loans to the campaign505152 and helped it survive a period of early debt.53
Once he was elected, the couple moved to Alexandria, Virginia.54 She spent two months in late 1983 writing handwritten notes on over 4,000 Christmas cards to be sent to constituents and others.55 She was an outsider who was snubbed by the Washington congressional social scene, in part because Carol McCain was a popular figure in town,56 and she grew homesick for Arizona.5758 She suffered several miscarriages.5960
She moved back to Arizona in early 1984,61 and gave birth to her child, Meghan, later that year.62 She subsequently had John Sidney IV (known as &quot;Jack&quot;) (born 1986) and James (known as &quot;Jimmy&quot;) (born 1988).63 Their fourth child, Bridget, was adopted in 1991. Her parents lived across the street and helped her raise the children while her husband was frequently in Washington;64 she typically only saw him on weekends.65 She organized elaborate fundraisers for him and expanded their home.66
In April 1986, she and her father invested $359,100 in a shopping center project with Phoenix banker Charles Keating.67 This, combined with her role as a bookkeeper who later had difficulty finding receipts for family trips on Keating's jet,68 caused complications for her husband during the Keating Five scandal, when he was being examined for his role regarding oversight of Keating's bank.69
American Voluntary Medical Team
Founding and mission
In 1988, inspired by a vacation visit four years earlier to substandard medical facilities on Truk Lagoon,7071 Cindy McCain founded the American Voluntary Medical Team (AVMT).72 It was a non-profit organization that organized trips for doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel to provide MASH-like emergency medical care to disaster-struck or war-torn third-world areas such as Micronesia, Vietnam (before relations were normalized between them and the U.S.73), Kuwait (arriving five days after the conclusion of the Gulf War74), Zaire (to help refuges from the Rwandan genocide75), Iraq, Nicaragua, India, Bangladesh and El Salvador.7677787980 She led 55 of these missions over the next seven years,81 with each being of at least two weeks' duration.82 AVMT also supplied treatment to poor sick children around the world.83 In 1993, Cindy McCain and the AVMT were honored with an award from Food for the Hungry.84
Adoption
While at Mother Teresa's orphanage in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 1991 &lt;U+2014&gt; as part of AVMT's assistance team following the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone85 &lt;U+2014&gt; she met two infant girls she decided needed to be brought to the United States for medical treatment.86 She decided to adopt one of the girls (her husband readily agreeing), later named Bridget,87 and helped coordinate the adoption of the other little girl, named Mickey, for Wes Gullett, a family friend.88
Prescription drug addiction
In 1989, Cindy McCain became addicted to Percocet and Vicodin, opioid painkillers, which she initially took to alleviate pain following two spinal surgeries for ruptured discs, and to ease emotional stress during the Keating Five affair.8990919293 The addiction progressed to where she was taking upwards of twenty pills a day,94 and she resorted to having an AVMT physician write illegal prescriptions in the names of three AVMT employees without their knowledge.9596 In 1992, her parents staged an intervention to force her to get help;97 she told her husband about her problem, attended a drug treatment facility, began outpatient sessions, and ended her three years of addiction.98 Surgery in 1993 resolved her back pain.99100
In January 1993, Tom Gosinski, an AVMT employee who had discovered her illegal drug use, was terminated on budgetary grounds.101 Subsequently, he tipped off the Drug Enforcement Administration, and a federal investigation ensued.102103 McCain's defense team, led by John McCain's Keating Five lawyer John Dowd, secured an agreement with the U.S. Attorney's office for McCain, a first-time offender, that avoided charges while requiring her to pay financial restitution, enroll in a diversion program and do community service.104105106 Meanwhile, in early 1994 Gosinski filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against McCain, which he told her he would settle for $250,000.107108 In response, Dowd characterized this request as blackmail and requested that officials investigate Gosinski for extortion.109110 In the end, both Gosinski's lawsuit and the extortion investigation against him were dropped.111112
Knowing that the DEA prosecutors were about to publicly disclose her past addiction, McCain preemptively revealed the story to reporters saying she was doing so willingly: &quot;Although my conduct did not result in compromising any missions of AVMT, my actions were wrong, and I regret them.&quot;113114115
Aftermath
AVMT concluded its activities in 1995 in the wake of the McCain narcotics prescriptions controversy.116117 That year, McCain founded a new organization, the Hensley Family Foundation, which donates monies towards children's programs in Arizona and nationally,118 and she was largely a stay-at-home mom during the balance of the 1990s.119 She also held positions as vice president, director, and vice chair of Hensley &amp; Co.120121
Role in 2000 presidential campaign
Although wary of the media,122 McCain was active in her husband's eventually unsuccessful campaign for President of the United States in 2000.123 She mostly provided good cheer, without discussing her opinions about national policy. She impressed Republican voters with her elegance at coffee shops and other small campaign settings, where she frequently referred to her children, carpooling, and charity work.124
She was upset by the notorious smear tactics125126 against her husband in the South Carolina primary that year, which included allegations involving her adopted daughter Bridget that she found &quot;despicable&quot;.127 Cindy McCain eventually forgave those responsible.128 She was chosen as the chair of the Arizona delegation to the 2000 Republican National Convention.129
Between presidential campaigns
John and Cindy McCain at a Naval Sea Cadet Corps graduation, Fort Dix, New Jersey, July 2001.
In 2000, she became chair of the now $300-million-a-year Hensley &amp; Co.130 following her father's death.131 She, her children, and one of John McCain's children from his first marriage own 68 percent of the company.132 As chair, her role takes the form of consultations with the company CEO on major initiatives such as new products, new plants, or employee welfare, rather than of an active physical presence;133134 she does not have operational control of Hensley, and Anheuser-Busch considers her to be an absentee owner.135 By 2007, she had an annual income of over $400,000 from Hensley and an estimated net worth of $100 million.136 She also owned at least $2.7 million worth of shares of Anheuser-Busch stock.137138 With her children, she owns a minority stake in the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team.139
She became actively involved with Operation Smile in 2001,140 taking parts in its trips to Morocco, Vietnam, and India.141 She was honored by the organization in 2005,142 and sits on its board of directors.143 She joined the board of directors of CARE in 2005.144 She is on the board of the HALO Trust,145 and has visited operations to remove landmines in Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Mozambique, and Angola.146 She makes financial contributions to these organizations via her family trust147 and views her role as watching them in the field to ensure they are frugal and their money is being spent effectively.148 On occasion she has criticized foreign regimes on human rights grounds, such as Myanmar's military junta.149
In April 2004 McCain suffered a near-fatal stroke caused by high blood pressure,150151 although she was still able to attend some events.152 After several months of physical therapy to overcome her leg and arm limitations, she made a mostly full recovery, although she still suffers from some short-term memory loss and difficulties in writing.153 She owns a home in Coronado, California, next to the Hotel del Coronado;154 her family had vacationed in Coronado growing up, and she has gone there for recuperation and family get-togethers.155 She or her family owns other residential and commercial real estate in California, Arizona and Virginia156 and, including rental properties, McCain herself owns ten homes and part of three office complexes.157158159 She is an amateur pilot and race car driver.160
Role in 2008 presidential campaign
 She has been active and visible in her husband's presidential campaign during 2007 and 2008,161 returning to Arizona frequently to attend to domestic duties162 and interrupting campaigning for her overseas charitable work.163164 She has preferred to travel with her husband and introduce him, rather than act as a campaign surrogate with a separate schedule.165166 In August 2008, a member of the public shook her hand very vigorously, aggravating her existing carpal tunnel syndrome condition and causing her to slightly sprain her wrist.167
McCain has stated that the American public wants a First Lady of the United States who will tend toward a traditional role in that position.168 She would not attend Cabinet meetings,169 but would continue her involvement in overseas non-profit organizations and would urge Americans to do the same globally or locally;170 she envisions herself as a possible figurehead for humanitarian work, along the lines of Diana, Princess of Wales.171  She made statements critical of the Bush administration for not deploying enough troops during the Iraq War,172 and was an internal critic within the McCain campaign of its profligate spending during the first part of 2007.173 In February 2008, McCain made news by being critical of Michelle Obama, the wife of Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama, who had said, &quot;And let me tell you something: For the first time in my adult lifetime I am really proud of my country.&quot; McCain replied: &quot;I am proud of my country. I don't know about you&lt;U+2014&gt;if you heard those words earlier&lt;U+2014&gt;I am very proud of my country.&quot;174 Also in February 2008, she publicly appeared beside her husband during a press conference in response to a newspaper report regarding his connection to a lobbyist.175
McCain has faced media scrutiny about her wealth, spending habits, and financial obligations.176177178 At first declining to release her separate income tax returns, saying it was a privacy issue and that she would not do so even if she became First Lady,179 she later released the first two pages of her 2006 return, which showed $6 million in income for that year (including nearly $570,000 in itemized deductions and more than $1.7 million paid in federal income taxes).180 The campaign has said that any decisions about how to handle her role in Hensley &amp; Co. if she becomes First Lady would not be made until that time.181 While she would gain a considerable profit from the agreed-upon acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by the Belgian company InBev,182183 she was initially under some political pressure to help oppose the deal and keep Anheuser-Busch under American ownership.184
 In June 2008, a Rasmussen Reports poll found that 49 percent of voters viewed Cindy McCain favorably and 29 percent unfavorably,185 while an ABC News/Washington Post poll found figures of 39 percent and 25 percent respectively.186 Her style and fashion sense have been the subject of much media scrutiny.187188 McCain has been compared to former first lady Nancy Reagan,189 due to both her style and wardrobe190191 as well as demeanor.192 Early in the campaign, some recipes attributed to Cindy McCain turned out to be copied from other sources;193194 the campaign attributed the problem to an error by an intern.195
Cindy McCain spoke on both the opening and final nights of the 2008 Republican National Convention in early September 2008. On the first night, truncated due to national attention regarding Hurricane Gustav, she appeared with First Lady Laura Bush to deliver short remarks encouraging support for hurricane relief efforts along the Gulf Coast,196 and on the last night she introduced the seven McCain children and spoke about how her husband's love for his country had been passed on to them.197 In October 2008, she increased the intensity of her public remarks against Obama's candidacy.198
