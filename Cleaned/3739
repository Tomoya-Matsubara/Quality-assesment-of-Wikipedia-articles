&quot;Born This Way&quot; is a song by American recording artist Lady Gaga, from her second studio album, Born This Way. Written and produced by Gaga, Fernando Garibay, Jeppe Laursen and DJ White Shadow, &quot;Born This Way&quot; was developed while Gaga was on the road with The Monster Ball Tour. Inspired by the 1990s empowering music for women and the gay community, Gaga explained that &quot;Born This Way&quot; was her freedom song. Previously, she had sung part of the chorus at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards in 2010. The song was announced as the lead single from the album, and was released on February 11, 2011&lt;U+2014&gt;two days prior to its scheduled date&lt;U+2014&gt;along side the release of the full set of lyrics and the single artwork.
Musically &quot;Born This Way&quot; is an electropop song, backed by rumbling synth sounds and a humming bass, with a percussion added in the chorus. It also includes Gaga singing a capella near the end with an organ added. The lyrics of the song talk about self-empowerment and feature the names of LGBT communities like gay, lesbian and transgender, amongst others. The usage of the terms &quot;chola&quot; and &quot;orient&quot; in the song drew criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, who claimed that the terms had been used in an offensive and derogatory manner. The song was treated with different remixes, including a Country Road version recorded by Gaga herself, and another by Indian music producer duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant.
&quot;Born This Way&quot; received mixed reception from critics; it was complimented for being a &quot;club-ready anthem&quot;, while faced criticism for having similarities with Madonna's 1989 single &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. Some reviewers surmised that the similarities would damage the song's appeal, others felt that &quot;Born This Way&quot; was nonetheless a completely separate piece of work. The song reached number one in 19 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland and Sweden. In the United States, it became her third single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Additionally, &quot;Born This Way&quot; became the 1000th number-one song on the Hot 100, spending a total of six weeks atop the chart. It became the fastest-selling song in iTunes history, selling one million copies in five days.
The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Nick Knight and Gaga herself. It was inspired by painters like Salvador Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt; and Francis Bacon, and their surrealistic images. The main idea behind the video is Gaga giving birth to a new race, which is shown with the help of a prologue. After the song starts and a series of dance sequences later, the video concludes with the view of a city populated by this race. Critics noted the video for its cultural references and artistic similarities to the work of Michael Jackson, Madonna and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen, as well as to Greek mythology and surrealism. &quot;Born This Way&quot; was first performed at the 53rd Grammy Awards, where Gaga sang it after coming out of an incubating vessel. The song was also performed during the last leg of The Monster Ball Tour and in television shows like Saturday Night Live and Good Morning America. Singers Katy Perry and Maria Aragon have covered the song.
Background
In 2010, Lady Gaga was touring for her second world tour, The Monster Ball. At that time she started developing ideas for her second studio album, Born This Way.1 The first song written and recorded for the album was the title track itself, described by Gaga as a &quot;magical message&quot; song. She wrote it in ten minutes and compared the process to an Immaculate Conception.2 One of the first people to listen to the track was Gaga's friend Perez Hilton, who considered it to be a staple song for the gay community and felt it would be successful.3 White Shadow, one of the producers of the track, credited Gaga for coming up with the idea and the theme behind the song. &quot;We recorded it around the world, on the road, in whatever was available. It sounds like it reads, but not like you think until you hear it,&quot; he added.4 Gaga wanted to record her own freedom song, and explained with Billboard her inspiration behind the song:
&quot; Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone.&quot;5
On the 43rd episode of her web video series, Transmission Gagavision, Gaga told the interviewer that the greatest challenge she faced while writing &quot;Born This Way&quot; was how she could leave her insecurities behind her, and become confident. &quot;'Born This Way' is who I am. An artist in a constant state of half-fantasy/half-reality at all times,&quot; she added.6
Artwork and release
 On February 8, 2011, Gaga tweeted the words &quot;Trois Jours&quot; (&quot;Three Days&quot;), along with a picture of the official single artwork, via TwitPic.7 Gaga is shown naked in the black-and-white cover art and displays the tattoos on her back. Her hair is air-blown and she wears heavy make-up while sharp edges protrude from her face and shoulder.8910 The artwork was described by Charlie Amter from The Hollywood Reporter as harkening back to the classic record covers from the 1980s. He compared it to the artworks by bands like Missing Persons, Roxy Music and Duran Duran.11 Gordon Smart from The Sun also felt that the &quot;stark black and white image&quot; had a glossy eighties air about it.12 Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the cover art, feeling that Gaga looked almost &quot;animalistic&quot; in the picture, and her flowing hair made her look like a creature from the African jungle. She also added that the artwork was &quot;totally and completely fierce&quot;.13 Archana Ram from the same publication found similarities between the &quot;Born This Way&quot; cover art and Kylie Minogue's cover art for her 2007 single &quot;2 Hearts&quot;.14 Nicole Eggenberger from OK! described the artwork as a perfect balance between the singer's &quot;wild side&quot; and her glamorous looks.15 Leah Collins from Dose believed that the extreme make-up and tattoos were an ironic play on the title of the song.16
Gaga had sang a few lines from the song while accepting the 2010 MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year, for &quot;Bad Romance&quot;.1718 Given as a Christmas gift to her fans, Gaga announced, via Twitter, the release dates of the album and the lead single at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Day, 2011.19 The single was dated to be released on February 13, 2011, while the album on May 23, 2011. Supplementing this announcement came a black-and-white photograph in which Gaga, according to Jocelyn Vena from MTV, is &quot;nude from the waist down, with her hair blowing about, and sporting a jacket with 'Born This Way' emblazoned in what looks like bedazzled jewels.&quot;20 In late January 2011, Gaga released the lyrics of the song,21 before announcing that she planned to release the single two days prior to its stipulated date.22 Hence the song was premiered on radio stations worldwide at 6 a.m. EST on February 11, 2011, and was released for digital download from online retailers at 9 a.m. EST the same day.2324
Composition
&quot;Born This Way&quot; was written and produced by Gaga, Jeppe Laursen, Paul Blair (aka DJ White Shadow) and Fernando Garibay,2526 while it was mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London and Germano Studios in New York.27 The club-beat influenced song begins with Gaga's voice uttering the line &quot;It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M&quot; on a loop, backed by a rumbling synth sound and a humming bass.2829 As the synths change into a beat, Gaga belts out the song's first verse, followed by the bass dropping off and the percussion-backed chorus, &quot;I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes; I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way&quot;, which Jocelyn Vena from MTV likened as being &quot;meant to be heard in a big space. It's fast and hard-hitting.&quot;3031 After the chorus she chants the line &quot;Don't be a drag, Just be a queen&quot; a number of times on top of handclaps, before moving to the second verse.32 After the second chorus an interlude follows, where Gaga chants the names of various communities. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt that the interlude is a mixture of the music from American television show, Glee, and the song &quot;There But For the Grace of God Go I&quot; by Machine.33 The music fades out for a moment as Gaga sings a capella, before the addition of an organ and Gaga closes the song.34 According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, &quot;Born This Way&quot; is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate dance beat tempo of 120 beats per minute.35 It is composed in the key of B major with Gaga's voice spanning the tonal nodes of F3 to C5.36 &quot;Born This Way&quot; follows a chord progression of C5&lt;U+2013&gt;F5&lt;U+2013&gt;E5&lt;U+2013&gt;B5 in the verses, and F5&lt;U+2013&gt;F&lt;U+2013&gt;E&lt;U+2013&gt;B&lt;U+2013&gt;Bm7&lt;U+2013&gt;C in the chorus.37
The lyrics during the verses talk about empowerment, while the chorus talks about making no apologies and accept one as themselves.38 It features the names of LGBT and other minor communities, which was due to the support that Gaga had received from the community over the years. She also explained that since The Fame and The Fame Monster did not directly address those communities, &quot;Born This Way&quot; was her chance to create something that not only supported her political and social beliefs, but also empowered her to artistically say, &quot;'I'm not being safe with this record.' I'm not trying to gain new fans. I love the fans I already have, and this is for them.&quot;39
After the early release of the lyrics, it had garnered criticism from some Asian40 and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona,41 claiming that the usage of the terms &quot;chola&quot; and &quot;orient&quot; was offensive and derogatory.42 In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned the use of the term &quot;chola&quot;, asking, &quot;Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors.&quot;43 Radio stations in Malaysia chose to garble the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to concerns over censorship in the country, on content deemed offensive.44 In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: &quot;It is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably.&quot;45
Remixes
A number of remixes were commissioned by Interscope Records, to accompany the song. The first set of remixes were done by LA Riots, Chew Fu and DJ White Shadow. Titled Born This Way &lt;U+2013&gt; The Remixes Part 1, the remixes were released as CD single and digital download on March 15, 2011.46 Another set of remixes were done by Michael Woods, Grum, Dada Life, Zedd, Bimbo Jones and Twin Shadow. It was released on March 29, 2011, for digital download only, with the name Born This Way &lt;U+2013&gt; The Remixes Part 2.47 Gaga released a &quot;Country Road Version&quot; of the song on March 15, 2011, via her Twitter account.48 The version opens with the sound of guitars and then introduces a fuzzed-out slide guitar and harmonica wheeze, with the original disco beats replaced by restrained brush drumming and a more laid-back vibe. Once the first chorus starts, the song chugs along side the harmonica sounds.49 Just before the three-minute mark, Gaga sings new lyrics, &quot;If I wanna make it country, baby, then it's OK, cuz I was born, I was born, I was born this way,&quot; over a picked mandolin. According to Gil Kaufman of MTV, the song breaks into full-on country-rock mode, reminiscent of late-period Bon Jovi music, in the final minute.50 A portion of the money earned from sales of &quot;Country Road Version&quot; went to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN).51
|Salimmerchant.jpg|{{#expr: (150 * 214 / 231) round 0}}|Indian music producer duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant said that not much planning went into their remix of &quot;Born This Way&quot;, it was spontaneous.52||Portrait of a smiling Indian male|Portrait of a smiling Indian male}}
A Bollywood version of the song was done by Indian music producer duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant.53 The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news.54 The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, when they came to learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the Indian diaspora, was interested in a Bollywood remix for &quot;Born This Way&quot;.55 The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from &quot;Born This Way&quot;, and using it as a base, they designed the remix. &quot;We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on whether we were giving it the right groove. She loved it and that&lt;U+2019&gt;s how we went about it,&quot; he added.56 The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, sitar by Sunil Das, and the dhol and dholak in the chorus. Sulaiman told MTV News' Jocelyn Vena:
&quot;It's been such a big track, it's been very popular, and when you consider the style, it's very aggressive. It's got all the stuff that's required to make it a nice clubby track, so for us, the most important thing was: How do you get it into a zone where it's palpable to the Indian flavor? And the first thing we did was bring in a sitar, and that changed the flavor a little bit. We kept the aggression but changed the style and made it a little more four on the floor, a little more house.&quot;57
Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch, &quot;as that's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature.&quot; Gaga's management team were satisfied with their remix and wanted them to do another remix of her next song, &quot;Judas&quot;.58 The Bollywood remixes were a part of the Indian tracklist of Born This Way.59
Critical reception
Michael Cragg from The Guardian called the song a &quot;disco anthem&quot;, and said the chorus &quot;crashes in with the weight of a discarded meat dress&quot;. He also felt that the &quot;campness&quot; of the music made the lyrics sound less serious than it is.60 Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave the song five out of five stars and labeled it as &quot;an immediate pop classic&quot;, complimenting the hook and the chorus.61 Alison Schwartz from People added that &quot;the club-ready anthem, complete with a few A Capella chants and Italian lyrics, shows off Gaga's powerhouse vocal chords&lt;U+2014&gt;and knack for powerful songwriting.&quot;62 Jem Aswad from Billboard responded positively to the anthemic nature of the song, and felt that it would become a staple song to be played on the radio and dancefloors in the following months.63 Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song five out of five stars, describing it as a &quot;life-affirming equality anthem, a straight-up club pumper and a flat-out fantastic pop song.&quot;64 Writing for Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani understood that Gaga &quot;has tapped into something truly special, maybe even important.&quot; He also complimented the song's underlying message of equality.65 Meghan Casserly of Forbes expected &quot;Born This Way&quot; to be the biggest gay anthem ever, since, according to her, it was written with that purpose in mind.66 Annie Yuan of The Hollywood Reporter labeled the song &quot;a hodge-podge of other pop tunes.&quot;67 Kevin O'Donnell of Spin gave a mixed review, pointing out lyrical similarities to Michael Jackson's &quot;Black or White&quot; (1991). He added that seeing the hype surrounding the project, he expected Gaga to release a song &quot;as epic and instantly classic as The Beatles' 'A Day in the Life' or Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Imagine what she'd come up with if she'd spent more than ten minutes writing [the song].&quot;68
 Many critics noted similarities between &quot;Born This Way&quot; and Madonna's 1989 song, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. Popjustice website pointed out the influence of other Madonna songs like &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; (1993) and &quot;Vogue&quot; (1990).69 Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone acknowledged the influences of Madonna but pointed out that they would not overshadow the song, as it &quot;[summed] up all the complex Gaga mythos, all her politics and Catholic angst and smeared lipstick, in one brilliant pop blast.&quot;70 Caryn Ganz, while writing for Yahoo! Music, criticized &quot;Born This Way&quot;, stating that the song was &quot;overworked, overwrought, noisy, cheesy, and very, very derivative.&quot; She specifically noted the similarities to songs like &quot;When Love Takes Over&quot; (2010), &quot;Waterfalls&quot; (1993), and three of Madonna's songs: &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998), and &quot;Vogue&quot;.71 Megan Friedman from Time and Marissa Moss from The Huffington Post summarized their reaction as &quot;mixed&quot;, due to the similarities they found with &quot;Express Yourself&quot;.7273 Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph noted that the imitative nature of the song would affect perceptions of Gaga's artistry, since &quot;Born This Way&quot; was &quot;[basically] a reworking of Madonna's 'Express Yourself' with a touch of 'Vogue', which is a bit too much Madonna for someone who is trying to establish her own identity as the, er, new Madonna.&quot;74
Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times concluded that &quot;Born This Way&quot; had an entirely different message from the Madonna songs it was being compared to and further defended it by saying, &quot;Whether its sound comes too close to one or another Madonna song seems beside the point; what current pop hit doesn't go green by recycling something familiar?&quot;75 Sheffield defended Gaga by pointing out that &quot;Express Yourself&quot; was also copied by Madonna from the Staple Singers' song, &quot;Respect Yourself&quot;.76 Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, explaining that she had received an e-mail from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for &quot;Born This Way&quot;. If the Queen says it shall be, then it shall be,&quot; she added.77 CNN later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation.78 Two months later, while getting interviewed by NME magazine, Gaga further addressed the comparisons to &quot;Express Yourself&quot;:
&quot;Why would I try to put out a song and think I'm getting one over everybody? That's retarded. I will look in your eyes and tell you that I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough to think that you are dumb or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only similarities are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry.&quot;79

Music video
Development
The music video was shot the weekend of January 22&lt;U+2013&gt;24, 2011 in New York City, and was described by Gaga's team as a &quot;profound, so inspiring and so incredibly beautiful&quot; video.107 The video was directed by Nick Knight.108 Choreographer Laurieann Gibson told MTV News that the video would be &quot;shocking&quot; and one can expect the execution of the highest level of vocal music art and dance.109 Hollywoodlife.com reported that Gaga spent the first week of February editing the video in Greenwich Hotel, New York, working during the night as she had to spend the morning rehearsing for her upcoming Grammy Awards performance. Media reports suggested that the singer might play the character of Jo Calderone, the male model she had portrayed in the September issue of Vogue Hommes, Japan.110 Fernando Garibay explained that the video &quot;is of cultural relevance, and hopefully helps people that are an outcast, bullied. Hopefully makes people aware that it's OK to be yourself.&quot;111 According to Gaga, she was inspired by the paintings of Salvador Dal&lt;U+00ED&gt; and Francis Bacon, and their surrealistic images.112 Gibson explained the inspiration behind the video to MTV News:
&quot;When she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her. And so I woke up one night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message.&quot;113
Gibson recalled having to work with Gaga on her dancing in the video, and to make her a better dancer she wanted Gaga to be confident.114 Gaga chose New York to shoot the video because the city is her birth place. Before shooting started, Gibson and Gaga decided there was only one place to work on the avant-garde, modern dance routine for the video, Alvin Alley, where Gibson had studied dance.115 &quot;We rehearsed there because the choreography is really modern-based. It's, like, more technical than anything she's ever done,&quot; she recalled. Shooting also took place in Brooklyn for two days. Since Gaga did not want set pictures to be taken before the video was ready, her team had to hide the location and were successful, except at the last day when paparazzi started sneaking around.116
The video featured full-bodied tattooed model Rick Genest (Rico), better known by his stage name Zombie Boy.117 Gaga painted her face in a similar way to Genest, in one of the sequences. She said that the scene displayed the fact that she would not allow society or critics to dictate her beauty. &quot;I tell you what I think is beauty, and hence the scene was of me and Rico defining ourselves in artistic way and not relying on society to dictate it,&quot; she added.118 The costumes for the video were designed by Nicola Formichetti, who blogged about the various designer pieces shown in it.119 In the opening sequence of the video, Gaga wore a head accessory by Alexis Bittar, a diamond neckpiece by Erickson Beamon with earrings by Pamela Love, and a stained-glass dress by Petra Storrs. Finger rings were provided by Erickson Beamon and chiffon clothes by Thierry Mugler.120 For the &quot;Born This Way&quot; skeleton scene, both she and Rico wore tuxedos by Mugler while the slime during the orgy scenes were courtesy of Bart Hess. For her Michael Jackson impression in the alley, Gaga wore shirt and pants by Haus of Gaga, shoes by Natacha Marro, a Billykirk belt and LaCrasia gloves.121
Synopsis
 The music video was released on Monday, February 28, 2011,122 and begins with a brief shot of an Unicorn's silhouette in a steam-filled alley, inside a pink triangle frame. The triangle transitions to a shot of Gaga, with two opposite facing heads, sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star-filled space. Bernard Herrmann&lt;U+2019&gt;s prelude to the movie Vertigo plays123 while Gaga declares, &quot;This is the manifesto of Mother Monster,&quot; and begins telling the prologue of the video&lt;U+2014&gt;a story of the creation of an extraterrestrial race which &quot;bears no prejudice, no judgment, but boundless freedom.&quot; Gaga is shown sitting in the throne above a planet, with her legs spread apart, giving birth to a &quot;new race within the race of humanity.&quot; As she continues, Gaga explains that the birth of the new race was followed by the birth of evil, due to which Gaga is split in half while being pulled between the two opposing forces of good and evil. Her new half gives birth to an assault rifle and begins to fire it. The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning, &quot;How can I protect something so perfect, without evil?&quot;
As the song begins, numerous people are shown on their hands and knees in a motionless, organized pattern, in a seemingly endless black space. Gaga appears in a black bra and underwear, with shoulder and facial protrusions. She begins walking in an eccentric manner among them with raised hand, before contently nodding her head and crouching on her hands and knees to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone raises their head and begins dancing to elaborate choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. As the second verse begins, Gaga and Rico are both shown wearing tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his full-body zombie tattoos. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among several oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. Several more choreographed routines are performed by Gaga and her dancers, and when the song ends, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.
In the video's conclusion, a person's silhouette dances and struts in an alley, a tribute to Michael Jackson's &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot; video.124 The silhouette is revealed to be Gaga; her face drastically misconstrued, with sharp horns protruding from her face, glowing eyes, uneven hair, and a distinct Madonna-esque gap between her front teeth.125 She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city is seen in the background and a rainbow appears above her, and the final shot is a closeup of Gaga in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.
Reception
 The music video for &quot;Born This Way&quot; was met with mostly positive reception among music critics. James Montgomery of MTV praised the overall creationism concept of the music video, adding that it &quot;sort of makes sense, it sort of doesn't, but that 100 percent doesn't really matter much. This is Gaga at her most fabulous, her most out-there, her most, well, Gaga.&quot;126 In conclusion of his review, he wrote that the fantasy aspects of the video is overshadowed by the overall spectacle, which he believed was analogous to Gaga, &quot;after thoroughly dominating this world with 'Born This Way,' [she] seems content to create brand-new worlds to tower over.&quot;127 Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald felt that Gaga's penchant for eccentric and provocative imagery, was extreme in the video.128 Raphael Chestang from Entertainment Tonight praised the performance of Gaga and her dancers in the video, also complimenting the fashion.129 Monica Herrera from Billboard noticed that the video bore similarities to the music video of Madonna's &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; (1984), while believing it to be &quot;more of a high-fashion short film than a conventional music video&quot;.130 Jim Farber from New York Daily News wanted Gaga to add more humor in her videos, adding that although the video had &quot;joyous&quot; shock value, it definitely lacked creativity.131
Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that in the video, &quot;Gaga fully embraces the monstrous as a part of her.&quot; Moralde further explained that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as &quot;Mother Monster&quot;, but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. &quot;The things that are monstrous, the things that are different&lt;U+2014&gt;for Gaga, those are the things that are beautiful,&quot; he concluded.132 Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a &quot;Madonna rip-off&quot;, while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis.133134 Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a normal looking male or female consort. Powers further added that &quot;Gaga has found a way to place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy&lt;U+2019&gt;s girl or a 'boy toy'.&quot;135 Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found &quot;strange&quot;.136 The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swedish painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.137
Live performances
 On the February 9, 2011, episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, singers Justin Bieber and James Blunt performed their own rendition of the song along with DeGeneres, improvising the music, while singing the chorus.138 During the show, Gaga confirmed via telephone, that she will perform &quot;Born This Way&quot; on February 13, 2011, at the 53rd Grammy Awards.139 Gaga arrived at the ceremony in a giant incubating vessel that was carried onto the red carpet by numerous fashion models.140 She later emerged from another bigger egg on stage, dressed in a high ponytail, gold bra top and long skirt, with black and gold makeup and pointed shoulders and horns protruding from her face.141142 The &quot;Born This Way&quot; performance was introduced by Ricky Martin. In the first few seconds after performing the intro of the song, Gaga emerged from the egg,143 and after the first chorus, she whipped her hair in a manner similar to singer Willow Smith. Before the &quot;No matter gay, straight or bi&quot; line of the song, an organ emerged from the stage floor.144 Gaga played the music on the organ, which was surrounded by mannequin heads submerged in gel, before belting out the rest of the bridge as her dancers surrounded her.145146 Before leaving the stage, Gaga put on her trench and hat as the song faded out and Gaga and her dancers ended the performance with their hands put up in paws.147
According to Gaga the Grammy performance was inspired by many things, including Gregorian music, Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham's dance energy.148 On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to &quot;whip my hair back and forth on stage,&quot; referring to Smith's similar named song. Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice.149 The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus, and was thinking about birth and embryos.150 She had thought to herself, &quot;Gosh, the thing I hate most about doing award shows is, it can be distracting... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage. I don't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry. I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance, think only about the album, think only about the future of my fans. So that's what I did.&quot;151 Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the performance was &quot;surprisingly&quot; sparse compared to Gaga's previous &quot;over-the-top&quot; endeavors.152 Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the &quot;highly expected&quot; performance, feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography.153 Jason Lipscultz from Billboard described the performance as &quot;spirited&quot;, and felt that Gaga's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards.154 Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it, the performance was one of the highlights of the show.155 Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that &quot;It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga's performance of her new single 'Born This Way' was the evening's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle.&quot;156
 At the February 19, 2011, date of The Monster Ball Tour, Gaga performed &quot;Born This Way&quot; as a second encore, using the same general attire and choreography as the Grammy performance, however the incubation vessel was not present and slight alterations were made in the outfits of her dancers.157 The track was then added to the set-list of the concert tour. Tris McCall from The Star-Ledger was most impressed with the performance, calling it one of the highlights of the concert. He added that &quot;reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that it was hard not to wish she could get back to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out.&quot;158 Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show, in May 2011, along with another song from Born This Way, &quot;Yo&lt;U+00FC&gt; and I&quot;. Sitting atop a high stool, Gaga&lt;U+2014&gt;in a red leather blazer, a floppy mask-like hat and see-through leopard bodysuit&lt;U+2014&gt;played a piano made out of a wire high-heel structure. She began with an acoustic, piano-driven version of &quot;Born This Way&quot;, and then removed the hat as a synth kicked in for &quot;Yo&lt;U+00FC&gt; and I&quot;. The high-heel structure was designed by Gaga's sister Natalie Germanotta.159
At The Graham Norton Show in May 2011, Gaga performed &quot;Born This Way&quot; as the closing song of the show,160 while on Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria it was the opening song of the set list. Gaga started the show by emerging from a coffin, with a pregnant belly and dressed in leather. She started singing the song, and her biker-punk theme dressed dancers removed her pregnant belly to display her spiky shoulder outfit.161 Another performance took place at the season finale of Saturday Night Live, where the singer wore a metallic dress and a side ponytail. Midway through her performance, she displayed a pregnant belly as she emerged from within her dancers.162 Few days later, Gaga performed the song on Good Morning America as a part of their &quot;Summer Concert Series&quot;. She wore gold horns and a gold sequined jacket, and near the end of the performance she joined her dancers in a tank filled with 1,800 pounds of dyed gel.163 During a promotional visit in Europe in June 2011, piano versions of the song was performed on the final show of the sixth season of Germany's Next Topmodel,164 and at the EuroPride 2011 in Rome.165 A medley of &quot;Judas&quot; and &quot;Born This Way&quot; was the closing performance on the Paul O'Grady Live show in London. Ryan Love of Digital Spy had an advance preview of the recording of the show, and felt that this was the best performance of the two songs by the singer.166 Gaga closed the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards with &quot;Born This Way&quot;, appearing on stage inside a hanging cocoon, and emerging from it wearing a high-waistline trouser and a ruffled feathered top. Near the end of the song, she removed the feathered top and the yellow jacket underneath it.167 While on tour in Japan, &quot;Born This Way&quot; was performed along with &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot; on the 2011 MTV Video Music Aid Japan. Gaga was dressed in a sparkly sequined bra and long skirt with a split up each thigh. After finishing performing &quot;The Edge of Glory&quot;, she sneaked around the stage, and climbed some stairs to reach her piano&lt;U+2014&gt;which was decked up to look like a giant spider&lt;U+2014&gt;before launching into an acoustic version of &quot;Born This Way&quot;. After the first verse, she came down from the piano and joined her dancers for the album version of the song.168
Other versions
 On March 3, 2011, during her concert in Toronto (Canada), Gaga performed an a capella version of the song with ten-year old Maria Aragon. Gaga had been impressed by Aragon's singing abilities when the ten-year old uploaded her own version of &quot;Born This Way&quot; to YouTube. Aragon was subsequently invited on stage to sing with Gaga.169 She appeared wearing a fedora hat and carrying a stuffed monkey. Gaga sat at the piano, pulled Aragon onto her lap, before proceeding to sing a soul-inspired rendition of &quot;Born This Way&quot;, trading off verses.170 &quot;Maria represents what this song is all about,&quot; Gaga told the Canadian crowd after the performance. &quot;It's all about the next generation and the future.&quot;171 Later, Aragon was invited at Radio Hot 103, where she sang the chorus of &quot;Born This Way&quot; through the phone.172 She also performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on February 23, 2011.173
Fellow American singer Katy Perry performed a stripped down version of &quot;Born This Way&quot;, on the March 7, 2011, date of her California Dreams Tour, in Paris. The performance was accompanied by two guitarists playing acoustic guitars.174 The Glee cast covered the song during a thematic episode of their second season.175176 The episode was named &quot;Born This Way&quot;, and aired in the United States in April 2011, on Fox.177 Their version of the song was released for digital download, and sold 73,000 copies to enter the Billboard Hot 100 at number 44,178 and on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 31.179
American singer-songwriter and parodist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic had sought permission from Gaga to parody &quot;Born This Way&quot;, providing a brief description of the concept for his song. Her management responded that she must hear the song before providing approval. Yankovic obliged with the lyrics of &quot;Perform This Way&quot;, which was released on April 25, 2011, as the first single from his thirteenth studio album, Alpocalypse, on iTunes Store.180 After what Yankovic described as &quot;considerable expense&quot; in writing, recording, and mastering the song in the studio, he contacted Gaga's management again with a completed recording of the song. He was subsequently refused permission, without Gaga listening to the track and Yankovic getting the impression that the refusal came from the singer herself.181 Left with a completed song and abandoned plans for an outlandish music video to promote the song and album, Yankovic released it on YouTube.182 It was then that Gaga actually heard the song,183 and personally contacted Yankovic, giving him green light to include the song on Alpocalypse.184185
