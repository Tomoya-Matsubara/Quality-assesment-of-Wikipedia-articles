Atlanta ( or ) is the capital and most populous city in the U.S. state of Georgia.
As of 2008, Atlanta is the thirty-third largest city in the United States, with an estimated population of 537,958. Its metropolitan area, officially named the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA MSA (commonly referred to as Metropolitan Atlanta) is the ninth largest metropolitan area in the country, inhabited by approximately 5.5 million people. Moreover, the Atlanta Combined Statistical Area has a population approaching 6 million, making it is the most populous metropolis in the American Southeast and the focal point of the emerging megalopolis known as the Piedmont Atlantic MegaRegion. Like most areas in the Sun Belt, the Atlanta region has seen explosive growth in the past decade, adding more than 1.13 million residents between 2000 and 2008. It is the fastest growing area of the United States behind the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.1 Also in 2008, Atlanta became the eighth largest media market in the United States, with more than 2,387,520 households in its metropolitan area.2
Considered a top business city and transportation hub,34 Atlanta is the world headquarters of companies such as The Coca-Cola Company, Georgia-Pacific, AT&amp;T Mobility, CNN, Delta Air Lines, and Turner Broadcasting. Atlanta has the country's fourth largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies inside city limits (although UPS, Home Depot, and Newell Rubbermaid are not in the city limits) and more than 75 percent of the Fortune 1000 companies have a presence in the metro area. Also the Atlanta metro area has the 11th largest concentration of Fortune 500 companies headquarters.5 Hartsfield&lt;U+2013&gt;Jackson Atlanta International Airport, which is located seven miles south of downtown Atlanta, is the world's busiest airport and the only major airport to serve the city.67
Atlanta is the county seat of Fulton County and the fifth location for the seat of government of the state of Georgia. A small portion of the city of Atlanta corporate limits extends into DeKalb County. Residents of the city are known as Atlantans.8
History
The land constituting the city of Atlanta was once a Native American village called Standing Peachtree. The land that became the Atlanta area was taken from the Cherokee and Creeks by white settlers in 1822, with the first area settlement being Decatur.  On December 21, 1836, the Georgia General Assembly voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad to provide a trade route to the Midwestern United States.9 Following the forced removal of the Cherokee Nation between 1838 and 1839 the newly depopulated area was opened for the construction of a railroad. The area around the eastern terminus to the line began to develop first, and so the settlement was named &quot;Terminus&quot; in 1837. It was nicknamed Thrasherville after John Thrasher, who built homes and a general store there.10 By 1842, the settlement had six buildings and 30 residents and the town was renamed &quot;Marthasville&quot;.11 The Chief Engineer of the Georgia Railroad, J. Edgar Thomson, suggested that the area be renamed &quot;Atlantica-Pacifica&quot; after the Western and Atlantic Railroad, which was quickly shortened to &quot;Atlanta&quot;.12 The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.13 By 1854, another railroad connected Atlanta to LaGrange, and the town grew to 9,554 by 1860.1415
During the American Civil War, Atlanta served as an important railroad and military supply hub. In 1864, the city became the target of a major Union invasion. The area now covered by Atlanta was the scene of several battles, including the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, and the Battle of Ezra Church. On September 1, 1864, Confederate General John Bell Hood evacuated Atlanta after a four-month siege mounted by Union General William T. Sherman and ordered all public buildings and possible Confederate assets destroyed. The next day, Mayor James Calhoun surrendered the city, and on September 7 Sherman ordered the civilian population to evacuate. He then ordered Atlanta burned to the ground on November 11 in preparation for his march south, though he spared the city's churches and hospitals.16 
The rebuilding of the city was gradual. From 1867 until 1888, U.S. Army soldiers occupied McPherson Barracks in southwest Atlanta to ensure Reconstruction era reforms. To help the newly freed slaves, the Freedmen's Bureau worked in tandem with a number of freedmen's aid organizations, especially the American Missionary Association. In 1868, Atlanta became the fifth city to serve as the state capital.17 The Confederate Soldiers' Home was built to house disabled and elderly Georgia veterans from 1901 to 1941.18 Henry W. Grady, the editor of the Atlanta Constitution, promoted the city to investors as a city of the &quot;New South&quot;, one built on a modern economy, less reliant on agriculture. However, as Atlanta grew, ethnic and racial tensions mounted. The Atlanta Race Riot of 1906 left at least 27 dead19 and over 70 injured.
On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of Gone with the Wind, the movie based on Atlanta-born Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel of the same name. Stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Olivia de Havilland and legendary producer David O. Selznick attended the gala, which was held at Loew's Grand Theatre, now destroyed. Leslie Howard had returned to England for the war.20 The reception was held at the Georgian Terrace Hotel, which is still standing.
During World War II, manufacturing such as the Bell Aircraft factory in the suburb of Marietta helped boost the city's population and economy. Shortly after the war, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was founded in Atlanta.21  In the wake of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education, which helped usher in the Civil Rights Movement, racial tensions in Atlanta began to express themselves in acts of violence. On October 12, 1958, a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed; the synagogue's rabbi, Jacob Rothschild, was an outspoken advocate of integration.22 A group of anti-Semitic white supremacists calling themselves the &quot;Confederate Underground&quot; claimed responsibility.
In the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the Civil Rights Movement, as Dr. Martin Luther King and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities played major roles in the movement's leadership. Two of the most important civil rights organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, had their national headquarters in Atlanta. Despite some racial protests during the Civil Rights era, Atlanta's political and business leaders labored to foster Atlanta's image as &quot;the city too busy to hate&quot;. In 1961, Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city's public schools.23
African-American Atlantans demonstrated growing political influence with election of the first African-American mayor in 1973. They became a majority in the city during the late 20th century but suburbanization, rising prices, a booming economy and new migrants have decreased their percentage in the city from a high of 69 percent in 1980 to about 54 percent in 2004. The addition of new immigrants such as Latinos and Asians is also altering city demographics, along with an influx of white residents.24
In 1990, Atlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Following the announcement, Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation. Atlanta became the third American city to host the Summer Olympics. The games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies, as well as the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.25
Contemporary Atlanta is sometimes considered to be an archetype for cities experiencing rapid growth and urban sprawl.2627 Unlike most major cities, metropolitan Atlanta does not have any natural boundaries, such as an ocean, lakes, or mountains, that might constrain growth.
The city has recently been commended by bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency for its eco-friendly policies.28 In 2009, Atlanta's Virginia-Highland became the first carbon-neutral zone in the United States. Verus Carbon Neutral developed the partnership that links 17 merchants of the historic Corner Virginia-Highland shopping and dining neighborhood retail district, through the Chicago Climate Exchange, to directly fund the Valley Wood Carbon Sequestration Project (thousands of acres of forest in rural Georgia).2930
Geography
Topography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it is water. The total area is 0.51% water. At about  above mean sea level the airport is at , Atlanta sits atop a ridge south of the Chattahoochee River.
The Eastern Continental Divide line enters Atlanta from the south, proceeding to the downtown area. From downtown, the divide line runs eastward along DeKalb Avenue and the CSX rail lines through Decatur.31 Rainwater that falls on the south and east side runs eventually into the Atlantic Ocean, while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide runs into the Gulf of Mexico32 via the Chattahoochee River. That river is part of the ACF River Basin, and from which Atlanta and many of its neighbors draw most of their water. Being at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is still preserved, in part by the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. Downstream however, excessive water use during droughts and pollution during floods has been a source of contention and legal battles with neighboring states Alabama and Florida.3334
Climate
 Atlanta has a humid subtropical climate, (Cfa) according to the K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen classification, with hot, humid summers and mild, but occasionally cold winters by the standards of the southern United States. July highs average  or above, and low average .35 Infrequently, temperatures can even exceed . The highest temperature recorded in the city is , reached in July, 1980.36 January is the coldest month, with an average high of , and low of .37 Generally average lows are in the upper 20s and lower 30s in the north Georgia region. Warm fronts can bring springlike temperatures in the 60s (high teens) and 70s (low 20s) in winter, and Arctic air masses can drop nighttime temperatures into the teens (&lt;U+2212&gt;11 to -7 C). The coldest temperature ever recorded was  in February 1899.38 A close second was , reached in January 1985.39 Atlanta has a more temperate climate than other southern cities of the same latitude due to its relatively high elevation of  above sea level.
Like the rest of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta receives abundant rainfall, which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. Average annual rainfall is .40 An average year sees frost on 36 days; snowfall averages about  annually. The heaviest single storm brought  on January 23, 1940.41 Blizzards are rare but possible; one hit in March 1993. Frequent ice storms can cause more problems than snow; the most severe such storm may have occurred on January 7, 1973.42 
In 2007, the American Lung Association ranked Atlanta as having the 13th highest level of particle pollution in the United States.43 The combination of pollution and pollen levels, and uninsured citizens caused the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America to name Atlanta as the worst American city for asthma sufferers to live in.44
On March 14, 2008, an EF2 tornado hit downtown Atlanta with winds up to . The tornado caused damage to Philips Arena, the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, the CNN Center, and the Georgia World Congress Center. It also damaged the nearby neighborhoods of Vine City to the west and Cabbagetown, and Fulton Bag and Cotton Mills to the east. While there were dozens of injuries, only one fatality was reported.45 City officials warned it could take months to clear the devastation left by the tornado.46
Cityscape

Skyline of Downtown and Midtown Atlanta.
]]
Architecture
Atlanta's skyline is punctuated with highrise and midrise buildings of modern and postmodern vintage. Its tallest landmark &lt;U+2013&gt; the Bank of America Plaza &lt;U+2013&gt; is the 37th-tallest building in the world at . It is also the tallest building in the United States outside of Chicago and New York City.47
  Unlike many other Southern cities such as Savannah, Charleston, Wilmington, and New Orleans, Atlanta chose not to retain its historic Old South architectural characteristics. Instead, Atlanta viewed itself as the leading city of a progressive &quot;New South&quot; and opted for expressive modern structures.48 Atlanta's skyline includes works by most major U.S. firms and some of the more prominent architects of the 20th century, including Michael Graves, Richard Meier, Marcel Breuer, Renzo Piano, Pickard Chilton, and soon, David Chipperfield. Atlanta's most notable hometown architect may be John Portman whose creation of the atrium hotel beginning with the Hyatt Regency Atlanta (1967) made a significant mark on the hospitality sector. Through his work, Portman&lt;U+2014&gt;a graduate of Georgia Tech's College of Architecture -- reshaped downtown Atlanta with his designs for the Atlanta Merchandise Mart, Peachtree Center, the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, and SunTrust Plaza. The city's highrises are clustered in three districts in the city &lt;U+2014&gt; Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead.49 (there are two more major suburban clusters, Perimeter Center to the north and Cumberland/Vinings to the northwest). The central business district, clustered around the Hyatt Regency Atlanta50 hotel &lt;U+2013&gt; one of the tallest buildings in Atlanta at the time of its completion in 1967 &lt;U+2013&gt; also includes the newer 191 Peachtree Tower, Westin Peachtree Plaza, SunTrust Plaza, Georgia-Pacific Tower, and the buildings of Peachtree Center. Midtown Atlanta, farther north, developed rapidly after the completion of One Atlantic Center in 1987.
Urban development
 Businesses continue to move into the Midtown district.51 The district's newest office tower, 1180 Peachtree, opened there in 2006 at a height of , and achieved a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) gold certification that year from the U.S. Green Building Council. Atlanta has been in the midst of a construction and retail boom, with over 60 new highrise or midrise buildings either proposed or under construction as of April 19, 2006.52 October 2005 marked the opening of Atlantic Station, a former brownfield steel plant site redeveloped into a mixed-use urban district. In early 2006, Mayor Franklin set in motion a plan to make the 14-block stretch of Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta (nicknamed &quot;Midtown Mile&quot;) a street-level shopping destination envisioned to rival Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive or Chicago's Magnificent Mile.5354 
In spite of civic efforts such as the opening of Centennial Olympic Park in downtown in 1996, Atlanta ranks near last in area of park land per capita among cities of similar population density, with  per thousand residents (36 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;/resident) in 2005.55 The city has a reputation, however, as a &quot;city of trees&quot; or a &quot;city in a forest&quot;;5657 beyond the central Atlanta and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a sometimes dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. Founded in 1985, Trees Atlanta has planted and distributed over 68,000 shade trees.58
The city's northern district, Buckhead, is eight miles north of downtown Atlanta and features wealthy neighborhoods, such as Peachtree Battle, Tuxedo Park, Peachtree Hills, and Chastain Park, and is consistently ranked as one of the most affluent neighborhoods in America. Atlanta's East Side is quickly emerging as an intown destination as a result of the rapid gentrification it has undergone in the current decade. It boasts hip and urban neighborhoods with craftsman bungalows, Victorian mansions, and new infill. Some of the more established neighborhoods include Inman Park, Candler Park, Lake Claire, and Little Five Points. The more affordable neighborhoods of Kirkwood, Old Fourth Ward, East Atlanta, Cabbagetown, Reynoldstown and Edgewood also have much to offer.59 These areas of the city are also appealing to the younger, hip generation of people between the ages of 18-35 due to the location of shopping, transportation and cultural living. In addition to creating new space within the city, developers have also utilized many old buildings to create living space for the forementioned neighborhoods. In the city's Southwestern section, Collier Heights is home to the wealthy and elite African-American population of the city, and features neighborhoods such as Cascade Heights and Peyton Forest.60

Atlanta is one of eight U.S. cities classified as a &quot;beta world city&quot; by a 2008 study at Loughborough University,94 and ranks fourth in the number of Fortune 500 companies headquartered within city boundaries, behind New York City, Houston, and Dallas.95 Several major national and international companies are headquartered in Atlanta or its nearby suburbs, including three Fortune 100 companies: The Coca-Cola Company, Home Depot, and United Parcel Service in adjacent Sandy Springs. The headquarters of AT&amp;T Mobility (formerly Cingular Wireless), the second largest mobile phone service provider in the United States, is located near Lenox Square.96 Newell Rubbermaid is one of the most recent companies to relocate to the metro area; in October 2006, it announced plans to move its headquarters to Sandy Springs.97 Other headquarters for some major companies in Atlanta and around the metro area include Arby's, Chick-fil-A, Earthlink, Equifax, Gentiva Health Services, Georgia-Pacific, Oxford Industries, RaceTrac Petroleum, Southern Company, SunTrust Banks, Mirant, and Waffle House. In early June 2009, NCR Corporation announced that they will relocate its headquarters to the nearby suburb of Duluth, Georgia.98 First Data is also a large corporation who announced in August 2009 that they would move its headquarters to Sandy Springs.99 Over 75% of the Fortune 1000 companies have a presence in the Atlanta area, and the region hosts offices of about 1,250 multinational corporations. As of 2006 Atlanta Metropolitan Area ranks as the 10th largest cybercity (high-tech center) in the US, with 126,700 high-tech jobs.100
Delta Air Lines is the city's largest employer and the metro area's third largest.101 Delta operates one of the world's largest airline hubs at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and, together with the hub of competing carrier AirTran Airways, has helped make Hartsfield-Jackson the world's busiest airport, both in terms of passenger traffic and aircraft operations. The airport, since its construction in the 1950s, has served as a key engine of Atlanta's economic growth.102
Atlanta has a sizable financial sector. SunTrust Banks, the seventh largest bank by asset holdings in the United States,103 has its home office on Peachtree Street in downtown.104 The Federal Reserve System has a district headquarters in Atlanta; the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which oversees much of the deep South, relocated from downtown to midtown in 2001.105 Wachovia announced plans in August 2006 to place its new credit-card division in Atlanta,106 and city, state and civic leaders harbor long-term hopes of having the city serve as the home of the secretariat of a future Free Trade Area of the Americas.107
Atlanta is also home to a growing Biotechnology sector, gaining recognition through such events as the 2009 BIO International Convention.108
The auto manufacturing sector in metropolitan Atlanta has suffered setbacks recently, including the planned closure of the General Motors Doraville Assembly plant in 2008, and the shutdown of Ford Motor Company's Atlanta Assembly plant in Hapeville in 2006. Kia, however, has broken ground on a new assembly plant near West Point, Georgia.109
The city is a major cable television programming center. Ted Turner began the Turner Broadcasting System media empire in Atlanta, where he bought a UHF station that eventually became WTBS. Turner established the headquarters of the Cable News Network at CNN Center, adjacent today to Centennial Olympic Park. As his company grew, its other channels &lt;U+2013&gt; the Cartoon Network, Boomerang, TNT, Turner South, Turner Classic Movies, CNN International, CNN en Espa&lt;U+00F1&gt;ol, HLN, and CNN Airport Network &lt;U+2013&gt; centered their operations in Atlanta as well (Turner South has since been sold). Turner Broadcasting is a division of Time Warner. The Weather Channel, owned by a consortium of NBC Universal, Blackstone Group, and Bain Capital, has its offices in the nearby suburb of Marietta.
Cox Enterprises, a privately held company controlled by James C. Kennedy, his sister Blair Parry-Okeden and their aunt Anne Cox Chambers, has substantial media holdings in and beyond Atlanta; it is headquartered in the city of Sandy Springs.110111 Its Cox Communications division, headquartered in unincorporated DeKalb County,112 is the third-largest cable television service provider in the United States;113 the company also publishes over a dozen daily newspapers in the United States, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. WSB &lt;U+2013&gt; the flagship station of Cox Radio &lt;U+2013&gt; was the first AM radio station in the South.
Unincorporated DeKalb County is also home to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Adjacent to Emory University, with a staff of nearly 15,000 (including 6,000 contractors and 840 Commissioned Corps officers) in 170 occupations, including: engineers, entomologists, epidemiologists, biologists, physicians, veterinarians, behavioral scientists, nurses, medical technologists, economists, health communicators, toxicologists, chemists, computer scientists, and statisticians. Headquartered in DeKalb County, CDC has 10 other offices throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. In addition, CDC staff are located in local health agencies, quarantine/border health offices at ports of entry, and 45 countries around the world. Originally established in 1946 as the Communicable Disease Center, its primary function was to combat malaria, the deep southeast being the heart of the U.S. malaria zone at the time.
Atlanta is the headquarters of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Region II.
Law and government
Atlanta City Hall
Atlanta is governed by a mayor and a city council. The city council consists of 15 representatives&lt;U+2014&gt;one from each of the city's twelve districts and three at-large positions. The mayor may veto a bill passed by the council, but the council can override the veto with a two-thirds majority.114 The mayor of Atlanta is Kasim Reed.
Every mayor elected since 1973 has been black.115 Maynard Jackson served two terms and was succeeded by Andrew Young in 1982. Jackson returned for a third term in 1990 and was succeeded by Bill Campbell. In 2001, Shirley Franklin became the first woman to be elected Mayor of Atlanta, and the first African-American woman to serve as mayor of a major southern city.116 She was re-elected for a second term in 2005, winning 90% of the vote. Atlanta city politics during the Campbell administration suffered from a notorious reputation for corruption, and in 2006 a federal jury convicted former mayor Bill Campbell on three counts of tax evasion in connection with gambling income he received while Mayor during trips he took with city contractors.117 As the state capital, Atlanta is the site of most of Georgia's state government. The Georgia State Capitol building, located downtown, houses the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor and secretary of state, as well as the General Assembly. The Governor's Mansion is located on West Paces Ferry Road, in a residential section of Buckhead. Atlanta is also home to Georgia Public Broadcasting headquarters and Peachnet, and is the county seat of Fulton County, with which it shares responsibility for the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System. The city of Atlanta is served by the Atlanta Police Department, which has an estimated 1700 officers working in the force.
The United States Postal Service operates several post offices throughout the city. The Atlanta Main Post Office is located at 3900 Crown Road SW, in close proximity to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.118119
Crime
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Report, Atlanta recorded 141 homicides in 2006, down from 151 in 2004. In 2007 Dekalb County had a record 102 murders, Clayton County amassed 56 rapes, and unincorparted parts of Fulton County (East Point, College Park, and Union City) recorded 75. All together, the five-county core area of metro Atlanta (Cobb, Clayton, Fulton, Gwinnett, and Dekalb counties) recorded 487 murders in 2007.120 .121
Demographics
As of the 2008 American Community Survey, the city of Atlanta had a population of 537,958, an increase of 28% from the 2000 Census.122 According to the 2008-2010 American Community Survey, Blacks or African Americans made up 52.8% of Atlanta's population; of which 52.4% were non-Hispanic. White Americans made up 33.4% of Atlanta's population; of which 31.2% were non-Hispanic. American Indians made up 0.2% of the city's population. Asian Americans made up 5.9% of the city's population. Pacific Islander Americans made up less than 0.1% of the city's population. Individuals from some other race made up 2.6% of the city's population; of which 0.2% are non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 1.1% of the city's population. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 8.9% of Atlanta's population. The median income for a household in the city was $51,482 and the median income for a family was $55,939. Males had a median income of $36,162 compared to $30,178 for females. The per capita income for the city was $29,772. About 22.7% of the population and 21.3% of families lived below the poverty line.
The city of Atlanta is seeing a unique and drastic demographic increase in its white population, and at a pace that outstrips the rest of the nation. The proportion of whites in the city's population, according to Brookings Institution, grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other U.S. city. It increased from 31% in 2000 to 35% in 2006, a numeric gain of 26,000, more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000. Only Washington, D.C. saw a comparable increase in white population share during those years.123
The city of Atlanta also has one of the highest LGBT populations per capita. It ranks 3rd of all major cities, behind San Francisco and slightly behind Seattle, with 13% of the city's total population recognizing themselves as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.124125
According to the 2000 United States Census (revised in 2004), Atlanta has the twelfth highest proportion of single-person households nationwide among cities of 100,000 or more residents, which was at 38.5%.126
According to a 2000 daytime population estimate by the Census Bureau,127 over 250,000 more people commuted to Atlanta on any given workday, boosting the city's estimated daytime population to 676,431. This is an increase of 62.4% over Atlanta's resident population, making it the largest gain in daytime population in the country among cities with fewer than 500,000 residents.
According to census estimates, the city of Atlanta was the thirteenth fastest growing city in the nation, in terms of both percentage and numerical increase.128
Since the 1990s, the number of immigrants from Latin America to the Atlanta metropolitan area has greatly increased. This flow of immigrants has brought new cultural and religious practices and affect the economy and demography of the urban area, resulting in vibrant Hispanic communities within the city.
Atlanta is also home to the fastest growing millionaire population in the United States. The number of households in Atlanta with $1 million or more in investable assets, not including primary residence and consumable goods, will increase 69% through 2011, to approximately 103,000 households.129
Education

Colleges and universities
Atlanta is home to one of the largest concentrations of colleges and universities in the country. The city has more than 30 institutions of higher education, including the Georgia Institute of Technology, a premier research university that has been ranked among the nations top ten public universities since 1999 by US News and World Report, Georgia State University, and Mercer University Atlanta's Cecil B. Day Graduate and Professional Studies campus. The city also hosts the Atlanta University Center, the largest consortium of historically black colleges and universities in the country. Its members include Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, and the Interdenominational Theological Center. Adjoining the AUC schools, but independent from them, is the Morehouse School of Medicine.
Outer Atlanta contains several colleges, including Emory University, a prominent liberal arts and research institution that has been consistently ranked as one of the top 20 schools in the United States by US News and World Report; Oglethorpe University, a small liberal arts school named for the founder of Georgia with a faculty rated 15th in the nation by the Princeton Review; Agnes Scott College, a women's college; and several state-run institutions such as Clayton State University, Georgia Perimeter College, Kennesaw State University, Southern Polytechnic State University, and the University of West Georgia, as well as private colleges, such as Reinhardt College, which is just north of town and the Savannah College of Art and Design Atlanta campus.
Elementary and secondary schools
  The public school system (Atlanta Public Schools) is run by the Atlanta Board of Education with superintendent Dr. Beverly L. Hall. As of 2007, the system has an active enrollment of 49,773 students, attending a total of 106 schools: including 58 elementary schools (three of which operate on a year-round calendar), 16 middle schools, 20 high schools, and 7 charter schools.130 The school system also supports two alternative schools for middle and/or high school students, two single-sex academies, and an adult learning center.131 The school system also owns and operates radio station WABE-FM 90.1, a National Public Radio affiliate, and Public Broadcasting Service television station WPBA 30.
Transportation
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport , the world's busiest airport as measured by passenger traffic and by aircraft traffic,132 provides air service between Atlanta and many national and international destinations. Delta Air Lines and AirTran Airways maintain their largest hubs at the airport.133134 Situated  () south of downtown, the airport covers most of the land inside a wedge formed by Interstate 75, Interstate 85, and Interstate 285. The MARTA rail system has a station in the airport terminal, and provides direct service to Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Sandy Springs. The major general aviation airports near the city proper are DeKalb-Peachtree Airport  and Brown Field . See List of airports in the Atlanta area for a more complete listing.
With a comprehensive network of freeways that radiate out from the city, Atlantans rely on their cars as the dominant mode of transportation in the region135 Atlanta is mostly encircled by Interstate 285, a beltway locally known as &quot;the Perimeter&quot; which has come to mark the boundary between the interior of the region and its surrounding suburbs.
  Three major interstate highways converge in Atlanta; I-20 runs east to west across town, while I-75 runs from northwest to southeast, and I-85 runs from northeast to southwest. The latter two combine to form the Downtown Connector (I-75/85) through the middle of the city. The combined highway carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day. The Connector is one of the ten most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States.136 The intersection of I-85 and I-285 in Doraville &lt;U+2013&gt; officially called the Tom Moreland Interchange, is known to most residents as Spaghetti Junction.137 Metropolitan Atlanta is approached by thirteen freeways. In addition to the aforementioned interstates, I-575, Georgia 400, Georgia 141, I-675, Georgia 316, I-985, Stone Mountain Freeway (US 78), and Langford Parkway (SR 166) all terminate just within or beyond the Perimeter, with the exception of Langford Parkway, limiting the transportation options in the central city.
This strong automotive reliance has resulted in heavy traffic and contributes to Atlanta's air pollution, which has made Atlanta one of the more polluted cities in the country.138 The Clean Air Campaign was created in 1996 to help reduce pollution in metro Atlanta.
Around 2008 the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top of the longest average commute times in the U.S. Also, the Atlanta metro area has ranked at or near the top for worst traffic in the country.139
Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage, Atlanta's subway system, operated by Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), is the seventh busiest in the country.140 MARTA also operates a bus system within Fulton, DeKalb, Cobb and Gwinnett Counties. Clayton, Cobb, and Gwinnett counties each operate separate, autonomous transit authorities, using buses but no trains.
Atlanta has a reputation as being one of the most dangerous cities for pedestrians,141 as far back as 1949 when the Gone with the Wind author Margaret Mitchell was struck by a speeding car and killed while crossing Peachtree Street.142
The proposed Beltline would create a greenway and public transit system in a circle around the city from a series of mostly abandoned rail lines. This rail right-of-way would also accommodate multi-use trails connecting a string of existing and new parks. In addition, there is a proposed streetcar project that would create a streetcar line along Peachtree Street from downtown to the Buckhead area, as well as possibly another East-West MARTA line.
Atlanta began as a railroad town and it still serves as a major rail junction, with several freight lines belonging to Norfolk Southern and CSX intersecting below street level in downtown. It is the home of major classification yards for both railroads, Inman Yard on the NS and Tilford Yard on the CSX. Long-distance passenger service is provided by Amtrak's Crescent train, which connects Atlanta with many cities between New Orleans and New York. The Amtrak station is located several miles north of downtown &lt;U+2014&gt; and it lacks a connection to the MARTA rail system. An ambitious, long-standing proposal would create a Multi-Modal Passenger Terminal downtown, adjacent to Philips Arena and the Five Points MARTA station, which would link, in a single facility, MARTA bus and rail, intercity bus services, proposed commuter rail services to other Georgia cities, and Amtrak.
Greyhound Lines provides intercity bus service between Atlanta and many locations throughout the United States, Canada, and up to the Mexican border.
Surrounding municipalities
The population of the Atlanta region spreads across a metropolitan area of  &lt;U+2013&gt; a land area larger than that of Massachusetts.143 Because Georgia contains the second highest number of counties in the country,144 area residents live under a heavily decentralized collection of governments. As of the 2000 census, fewer than one in ten residents of the metropolitan area lived inside Atlanta city proper.145
