The FIFA Confederations Cup is a football (soccer) tournament for national teams, held every two years by FIFA. It is contested by the winners of each of the six FIFA confederation championships (CAF, CONMEBOL, UEFA, AFC, OFC, CONCACAF), along with the FIFA World Cup champion and the host country, to bring the number of teams up to eight. When the World Cup champion is also winner of its confederation championship, then the World Cup runner-up also enters the Confederations Cup, ensuring eight teams for the tournament. In the 2005 tournament, however, Brazil, as World Cup champion, and World Cup runner-up Germany, as host, had qualified. When Brazil also won the Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica, the vacant eighth spot was awarded to Argentina, runner-up in the Copa Am&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica.
The tournament was originally organised by and held in Saudi Arabia and called the King Fahd Cup, contested in 1992 and 1995 by the Saudi national side and some continental champions. In 1997, FIFA took over the organization of the tournament, named it the FIFA Confederations Cup and staged the competition every two years. Since 2005, the tournament has been held once in every four years, held one year prior to each World Cup in the country that will host the World Cup the following year. This decision was made to make the Confederations Cup a dress rehearsal for the World Cup.
The 2003 tournament was marred by tragedy, when the Cameroon player Marc-Vivien Fo&lt;U+00E9&gt; collapsed and died during the semi-final against Colombia.
For the next edition of the tournament Italy (World Champion) and South Africa (Host country) are already qualified.

Broadcasting rights
United Kingdom: Live coverage of selected matches has been shown on terrestrial channel Five, formerly known as Channel 5. Delayed coverage is usually shared between Five and satellite/cable network British Eurosport. Seen as a lower key event, the Confederations Cup has never been shown on main BBC and ITV channels. The rights are generally bought up quietly, around six months before the main event for much less money than the FIFA World Cup.
In Italy RAI must, by law, broadcast the Azzurri matches, therefore the state broadcaster is very likely to buy part of the rights (if not all of them, since they are cheaper than the World Cup ones) for the Confederations Cup when Italy participates.
