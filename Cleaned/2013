The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an undergraduate college in West Point, New York that educates and commissions officers for the United States Army during the American Civil War. The Academy was founded in 1802 and graduated its first class in October of the same year. It is the oldest of the five American service academies. Sports media refer to the Academy as &quot;Army&quot; and the students as &quot;Cadets&quot;; this usage is officially endorsed.1 A small number of graduates each year choose the option of entering the United States Air Force, United States Navy, or United States Marine Corps. Before the founding of the United States Air Force Academy in 1955, the Academy was a major source of officers for the Air Force and its predecessors. Most cadets are admitted through the congressional appointment system.23 The curriculum emphasizes various fields in sciences and engineering.45
