History
The town that would later be named Altus was founded in 1886.1 The community was originally called Frazer and served as a trading post until it was relocated after an 1891 flood.2 It was renamed Altus, a Latin word meaning &quot;high place&quot;.3
The city has seen relatively steady growth since the beginning. The population doubled between the time of Oklahoma statehood and the 1910 census and even increased during the Great Depression.4 An irrigation project in the 1940s and World War II led to further growth in the town as the nearby air field was used to train military pilots.5
Altus was an important city on the defunct Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway, one of the Frank Kell and Joseph A. Kemp properties, which stretched from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Forgan in Beaver County in far northwestern Oklahoma. It was later purchased by the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad and since 1991 is operated by the Wichita, Tillman and Jackson Railway.6
