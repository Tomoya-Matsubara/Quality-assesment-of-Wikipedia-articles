NUT midline carcinoma, abbreviated NMC, is a rare epithelial cancer that usually arises in the midline of the body and is characterized by a mutation in the nuclear protein in testis (NUT) gene.1
Symptoms
The symptoms are similar to other forms of cancer and dependent on the stage. Symptoms may include weight loss and fatigue.
NUT midline carcinomas are not specific to any tissue type or organ.2 Common sites include the head, neck and mediastinum.3
Pathology
NMC morphologically are poorly differentiated carcinoma with islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium.45
The differential diagnosis includes carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma and undifferentiated carcinoma.
The defining feature of NMCs is rearrangement of the NUT gene.6 Most common is a translocation involving the BRD gene and NUT gene (t(15;19)(q14;p13)).78
Prognosis
The prognosis is poor.
