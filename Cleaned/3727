Dr. Mishra had filed a writ petition in the Patna High Court, CWJC-7505/1998 against the Government of Bihar for providing Minimum Primary education in Maithili medium in the Maithili speaking region of Bihar.7
3 September 1998
Writ Petition, CWJC-7505/1998 was filed in High Court, Patna. Dr. Jayakant Mishra was the Petitioner and Lalan Kumar Verma was his advocate. Bihar Government was the respondent in the case and its advocate was A.N. Singh(SC8).8

Supreme Court, New Delhi
After losing in The High Court- Patna, The Bihar Government appealed in the Supreme Court- New Delhi against the judgement of The Patna High Court. Here also, the judgement was ruled in the favor of Dr. Jayakant Mishra.11

Withdrawl of similar cases
The Bihar govt has withdrawn few other similar cases (like Civil Appeal No(s). 2203-2208 of 2001).14 It clearly indicates that the Bihar govt has understood that Mithila &amp; Maithili can&lt;U+2019&gt;t be kept under suppression any more.
More than one and half year has passed. But, there is no official declaration from Bihar Government's side that how long will it take to implement the judgement.
Dr. Mishra's Support for Mithila state
