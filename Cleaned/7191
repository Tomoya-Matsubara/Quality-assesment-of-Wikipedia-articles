State Route 343 (also known as NY 343) is a state highway located entirely within central Dutchess County. It runs east&lt;U+2013&gt;west from the intersection of NY 82 in the village of Millbrook to the Connecticut state line in the town of Amenia, where it continues eastward as Connecticut Route 343. Along the way, it has a 7.3-mile (11.7 km) concurrency with NY 22 from the hamlet of Dover Plains to the hamlet of Amenia where NY 22's concurrency changes to that of U.S. Route 44.
Route 343 used the alignment of the Dover branch of the 19th-century Dutchess Turnpike for its entire length. The turnpike was a major transportation route at the time, connecting several local communities to Litchfield County, Connecticut and the city of Poughkeepsie. Modern Route 343 was first designated in 1930, connecting the hamlet of Amenia to the state line, but was relocated a few years later to run from the village of Milbrook to the hamlet of Dover Plains instead. The route was later extended to include its original alignment by 1947 using an overlap with NY 22.
Several major landmarks along the way include the Wassaic State Multiple Use Area in the hamlet of Wassaic, Beekman County Park in the hamlet of Amenia, and the Troutbeck Conference Center in the hamlet of Leedsvile.1 When Route 343 crosses the state line, becoming Connecticut Route 343, it becomes rural and residential, stretching for  into the town of Sharon, Connecticut, where it terminates at Connecticut Route 4 and 41.
Route description
 Route 343 begins at an intersection with NY 82 (cosigned as U.S. Route 44 until 2008) in the hamlet of South Millbrook. The road heads eastward, intersecting an old routing of Route 82 and passing to the south of Millbrook Golf and Tennis Club. Route 343 continues past fields, residential homes, and farms. The highway passes south of Mill Brook, then enters the hamlet of Littlerest. Soon afterward, at the intersection with County Route 99, it turns to the southeast for a distance. At County Route 23, Route 343 again changes its direction, this time to the northeast. Before long, the highway crosses another stream named Stone Church Brook in the hamlet of Mutton Hollow.2
Route 343 then changes directions a third time, traveling to the southeast once again. In the hamlet of Dover Plains, Route 343 turns to the northeast and becomes concurrent with northbound NY 22. The joined routes pass to the west of a series of moderately-sized mountains.3 Routes 343 and 22 head north out of Dover Plains through regions of rural farms, fields and homes. The roads parallel the Tenmile River and soon intersects with County Route 81 (a former routing of NY 22) south of the hamlet of Wassaic. The roads parallel as they head north, coming through and leaving Wassaic, crossing the Wassaic Creek and entering a small valley. Routes 343 and 22 soon pass by the Wassaic Train Station and continue northward towards the hamlet of Amenia.4
 County Route 81 merges as the main roads pass by Beekman Park and Silo Ridge Country Club in the hamlet of Amenia. The roads pass a pond and split at the intersection with U.S. Route 44. Routes 44 and 22 continue to the north, with Route 343 continuing eastward towards the state line. The road passes south of the Amenia Cemetery, changing directions several times. Route 343 then intersects with County Route 2 and turns to the northeast, passing over the Webatuck Creek. A few miles later, Route 343 crosses the state line and enters Connecticut.5
 When Route 343 crosses the state line into the town of Sharon, it enters a moderately rural area where a large factory is located. Route 343, known as Amenia Road, heads northeast towards the town center, passing through patches of forests and intersecting with Sharon Valley Road, a connector to Connecticut Route 361. After passing north of Sharon Country Club, the highway turns east as it enters the town center, where various homes and businesses are located. Route 343 ends at an intersection with Route 4 and Route 41 south of the town green.6
Route 343 is classified as a rural major collector road between Millbrook and Dover Plains and carries average annual daily traffic (AADT) of about 3,100 vehicles per day (as of 2006). The portion overlapped with Route 22 is a rural principal arterial road with average traffic of 5,600 per day. East of Route 22, Route 343 is a rural minor arterial road carrying about 4,100 vehicles per day.7
History
Old roads
What is now Route 343 became a major transportation route that passed through the settlements of Wassaic and Amenia. The highway had helped General George Washington's troops during the Revolutionary War and was also the main supply route to the hamlets of Payne's Corners (now Amenia), Washiac (now Wassaic) and Dover Plains. Stone statues that marked the way to different places including New York City, Fishkill and Boston were put up along the road during the Revolution, helping suppliers of salt from Boston.8 This highway grew significantly over the years, with settlements growing along the highway during the early 19th century.9 There were also a few factories along the route, including a Borden Food Corporation factory that produced condensed milk in the 1860s.10
Route 343 from the NY 22/US 44 intersection in Amenia to the Connecticut state line was part of the main line of the Dutchess Turnpike, which ran from Poughkeepsie to the state line at Amenia, mostly along modern US 44. Prior to the building of the turnpike, the section of Route 343 east of Amenia to the state line was a swamp and did not connect Amenia to the state line.11 The turnpike corporation was established by law in April 1802 and had finished grading the highway in 1805.12 In May 1803, the continuation of the Dutchess Turnpike into Connecticut, the Goshen and Sharon Turnpike, was also chartered. When the road was completed a few years later, it established a continuous improved road between Poughkeepsie and Hartford.13 In 1806, a branch route, splitting off from the mainline at South Millbrook, was established to connect the hamlet of Dover Plains to Poughkeepsie. The southern branch used modern Route 343 from its western end at US 44 in South Millbrook to NY 22 in Dover Plains.1415 The state took over maintenance of the turnpikes at the beginning of the 20th century. 
Designation
In 1924, the main line of the Dutchess Turnpike was designated as New York State Route 21, connecting the city of Poughkeepsie to the Connecticut state line as the original turnpike did. The road continued into Connecticut as New England Route 4.16 In the 1930 state highway renumbering, old Route 21 was broken up into several state routes. The portion between NY 22 in the hamlet of Amenia and the Connecticut state line in the town of Sharon was renumbered as NY 343.1718 In 1932, the continuation of NY 343 in Connecticut, which was previously part of New England Route 4, was renumbered to match the New York route number.19
 As part of the 1930 renumbering, the Dover branch of the Dutchess Turnpike between modern NY 82 in the village of Millbrook and NY 22 in the hamlet of Dover Plains was designated as part of New York State Route 200, which began in the city of Poughkeepsie and went via Millbrook to Dover Plains. By 1935, however, New York swapped the designations of Routes 200 and 343. The former Route 343 between the hamlet of Amenia and the Connecticut state line was changed to Route 200, while part of former Route 200 between the village of Millbrook and the hamlet of Dover Plains became Route 343. The changes were made as a part of a reconfiguration of state routes in the area due to the designation of U.S. Route 44 at the same time.20
The Route 200 designation was removed from the Amenia&lt;U+2013&gt;Sharon road by 1947 and Route 343 was redesignated on it. The two segments of Route 343 were connected via an overlap with NY 22, which remains to this day.21
