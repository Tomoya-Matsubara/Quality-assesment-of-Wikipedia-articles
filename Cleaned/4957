USS Indiana Battleship No. 1 was the lead ship of her Indiana class battleship class and the first United States Navy battleship equivalent to European designs of the time. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a relatively small battleship with heavy armor and ordnance that pioneered the use of an Pre-dreadnought battleship#Armament intermediate battery. Specifically intended for Coastal defence and fortification coastal defense, her freeboard nautical freeboard was too low in the water to deal well with the waves of the open ocean and she also suffered from several design flaws.
Indiana served in the SpanishAmerican War as part of the North Atlantic Squadron, taking part in the blockade related to the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. Although unable to join the chase of the Spanish cruisers, she was partly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish destroyers Spanish destroyer Pluton Pluton and Spanish destroyer Furor Furor. After the war she became quickly obsoletedespite several modernizationsand spent most of her time in commission as a training ship or in the reserve fleet, with her last commission  during World War I as training ship for gun crews. She decommissioned for the third and final time in January 1919 and was shortly after reclassified Coast Battleship Number 1 so that the name Indiana could be reused. She was sunk as a target in underwater explosion and aerial bombing tests in 1920 and her hulk was sold for scrap.
Design and construction
Main Indiana class battleship
Indiana and her sister ships USS Massachusetts BB-2 Massachusetts and USS Oregon BB-3 Oregon were based on a modified version of a design for a short range battleship drawn up by a policy board in 1889. At the time United States Congress held the view that battleships should be coastline defenders rather than oceangoing long range battleships, because the latter were associated with Imperialism.Friedman, U.S. Battleships, p. 2425. This design view was reflected in their moderate endurance, relatively small Displacement ship displacement and low freeboard, which limited sea going capability.Gardiner, Steam, Steel & Shellfire: The Steam Warship 18151905, p. 121. They were however heavily armed and armored, so much in fact that Conway's All The Worlds Fighting Ships describes them as attempting too much on a very limited displacement.

The ships had a main battery of four 13-inch 330&nbsp;mm guns, an intermediate battery of eight 8-inch 200&nbsp;mm guns and a secondary battery of four 6-inch 150&nbsp;mm guns, twenty QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss Hotchkiss 6-pounders, and six QF 1 pounder pom-pom Maxim-Nordenfelt 1-pounders, as well as four 18-inch 460&nbsp;mm British 18 inch torpedo Whitehead torpedo tubes.Reilly & Scheina, American Battleships 18861923, p. 54-55. The main battery was placed in two centerline turrets fore and aft, while the intermediate battery was placed on four wing turrets on the superstructure. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they caused the ship to list when aimed broadside. During later modernizations counterweights and several other improvements were added,Reilly & Scheina, American Battleships 18861923, p. 62. but the gun mountings never performed in an entirely satisfactory manner.
Indianas armor consisted mostly of&mdash;what was at the time&mdash;modern Harvey armor. Its main protection was a 18-inch 460&nbsp;mm armor belt protecting the waterline of the central citadel. The hull above this belt and deck had a few inches of armor and below the belt the ship had a double bottom. On the ends the belt connected via armored bulkheads to the main barbettes, which were 17&nbsp;inches 430&nbsp;mm thick and the main turrets above them had 15&nbsp;inches 380&nbsp;mm of vertical plating. Armor for the 8-inch turrets and barbettes was less than half as thick and the hollow conning tower was 10&nbsp;inches 250&nbsp;mm of nickel steel.Reilly & Scheina, American Battleships 18861923, pp. 56, 58 & 68. The main armor belt was placed relatively low, causing it to be completely submerged when the ship was loaded with the maximum amount of coal and supplies and making it effectively useless.Friedman, U.S. Battleships, p. 29.

In late 1896, both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas. Because the turrets were not centrally balanced, they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship, until they were secured with heavy ropes. Heavier clamps were installed, but in February 1896, while conducting fleet maneuvers with the North Atlantic squadron, the Indiana encountered more bad weather and started rolling heavily. Her new captain, Henry Clay Taylor, promptly ordered her back to port for fear the clamps would break again.Reilly & Scheina, American Battleships 18861923, p. 59. This convinced the navy that bilge keelsomitted during construction because the ship would no longer fit in most American dry dockswere necessary to reduce the rolling,

His squadron was ordered to the Spanish port of San Juan, Puerto Rico San Juan in an attempt to intercept and destroy Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete Cevera's Spanish squadron, which was en route to the Caribbean from Spain. The harbor was empty, but Indiana and the rest of the squadron bombarded it for two hours on 12 May 1898 before realizing their mistake. The squadron returned to Key West, where news arrived three weeks later that Commodore United States Commodore Winfield Scott Schley Schley's Flying Squadron US Navy Flying Squadron had found Cervera and was now blockading him in the port of Santiago de Cuba. Sampson reinforced Schley on 1 June and assumed overall command.Graham & Schley, Schley and Santiago, p. 203.

After the United States entered World War I, Indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island and in the York River Virginia York River. On 31 January 1919, she was decommissioned for the final time and two months later she was renamed Coast Battleship Number 1 so that the name Indiana could be assigned to the newly authorizedbut never completedbattleship USS Indiana BB-50.
The old battleship was brought to shallow waters in Chesapeake Bay near the wreck of the USS Texas 1892 Texas and used to test the effect of underwater explosions on her double bottom and watertight compartments in November 1920. She was also used for target practice by navy airplanes. On 19 March 1924, her hulk was sold for scrap.
