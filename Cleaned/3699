The ten euro (&lt;U+20AC&gt;10) note is the second lowest value of the euro banknotes after the five euro note and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.1 The ten euro note is the second smallest at 127x67mm with a red colour scheme.2 The ten euro note shows the Romanesque era (between the 11th and 12th centuries).3 It is consequently used daily by some 332 million Europeans.45 The ten euro banknote is used in the 23 countries which have it as their sole currency (with 20 legally adopting it) in Europe.

The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state.6 The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from ten years to forever.78
History
The euro was set up on 1 January 1999, when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe.9 For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountance. Euro banknotes and coins were not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the banknotes and coins of the eurozone 12, as it was then, national currencies like the Irish Pound and the Austrian schilling.10
Changes
There has so far only been one series of euro notes, however a new series similar to the current one is to be issued from 2011.11 The initial issue of notes bears the signature of the first president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, who was replaced on 1 November 2003 by Jean-Claude Trichet, whose signature appears on subsequent issues.12
Design
 The ten euro note is the second smallest at  &lt;U+00D7&gt;  with a red colour scheme.13 All bank notes depict bridges and arches/doorways in a different historical European style; the ten euro note shows the Romanesque era (between the 11th and 12th centuries CE).14 Although Robert Kalina's original designs were intended to show real monuments, for political reasons the bridge and art are merely hypothetical examples of the architectural era.15
Like all euro notes, it contains the denomination, the EU flag, the signature of the president of the ECB and the initials of said bank in different EU languages, a depiction of EU territories overseas, the stars from the EU flag and twelve security features as listed below.16 
Security features
As a lower value note, the security features of the ten euro note are not as high as the other denominations. However, it is protected by:
A hologram,17 tilt the note and you should see the hologram image change between the value and a window or doorway, but in the background, you sould see rainbow-coloured concentric circles of micro-letters moving from the centre to the edges of the patch. 18
A EURion constellation,19 special printing processes give the euro notes their unique feel.20
A glossy stripe,21 tilt the note and a the glossy stripe showing the value numeral and the euro symbol will appear.22
Watermarks,23 it appears when the banknote is against the light.24
Raised printing,25 special methods of printing makes the ink feel raised or thicker in the main image, the lettering and the value numerals on the front of the banknotes. In order to feel the raised print, run your finger over it or scratch it gently with your fingernail.26
Ultraviolet ink,27 Under ultraviolet light, the paper itself should not glow, fibres embedded in the paper should appear, and should be coloured red, blue and green, the European Union flag looks green and has orange stars, the ECB President signature turns green, the large stars and small circles on the front glow and the European map, a bridge and the value numeral on the back appear in yellow.28
Microprinting,29 On numerous areas of the banknotes you can see microprinting, for example, inside the &quot;EYP&lt;U+03A9&gt;&quot; (EURO in Greek characters) on the front. You will need a magnifying glass to see it. The tiny text is sharp, and not blurred.30
A security thread,31 The security thread is embedded in the banknote paper. Hold the banknote against the light - the thread will appear as a dark stripe. The word &quot;EURO&quot; and the value can be seen in tiny letters on the stripe.32
Perforations,33 Hold the banknote against the light. You should see perforations in the hologram which will form the &lt;U+20AC&gt; symbol. You should also see small numbers showing the value.34
A matted surface,35 the note paper is made out of pure cotton, which feels crisp and firm, but not limp or waxy.36
Barcodes,37
A serial number,38 like on every banknote.

Tracking
There are several communities of people at European level, most of which is EuroBillTracker,42 that, as a hobby, it keeps track of the euro banknotes that pass through their hands, to keep track and know where they travel or have traveled.43 The aim is to record as many notes as possible in order to know details about its spread, like from where and to where they travel in general, follow it up, like where a ticket has been seen in particular, and generate statistics and rankings, for example, in which countries there are more tickets.44 EuroBillTracker has registered over 96 million notes as of October 2011,45 worth more than &lt;U+20AC&gt;1.876 billion.46
