Ice Hockey has been a key element of Canada's cultural and social history. This has been captured on various releases from Canada Post. In the 2000's, the key release has been the series of National Hockey League All-Stars. The series lasted from 2000 to 2005. Other hockey issues have included a stamp to commemorate the International Postal Hockey Tournament and a stamp to commemorate the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah featured a hockey player. 1
