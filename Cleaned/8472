Vestby Station () is a railway station located at the village of Vestby, Norway on the railway &lt;U+00D8&gt;stfoldbanen. The station is served by commuter trains between Spikkestad via Oslo to Moss with half hour or hourly headway by Norges Statsbaner. The station opened in 1879, and has about 160 passengers to Oslo each day.1
History
 The station was opened in 1879 as part of &lt;U+00D8&gt;stfoldbanen.2 When the stretch between Ski Station and Moss was extended to double track in 1990s, Vestby Station received a major renovation.34 A regulation plan for the station area was released May 2010, which aimed at increasing the station's parking places.5 In June 2010, the station building caught fire at the middle of the night, but left no injuries.67 The station has also been victim of sabotage, when some local youth laid steel pipes over the tracks.8
Facilities
The station did, as mentioned earlier, get a major overhaul as the Follo Line was extended to double track in the 1990s. The station is therefore designed in the same style as the new station Sonsveien, with a modern walkway over the tracks.9 The walkway is built in gluelam, and is integrated with the stations platforms into one minimalistic construction.10 On the east side is a bus stop, on the west side is a park and ride facility with place for up to 120 cars.11 There is also a taxi stand at the station.12
The station has a station building, which is opened from 05.45-12.00 on workdays, and stores a small kiosk.13 The platforms have sheds and ticket machines. It is located north of Sonsveien Station and south of &lt;U+00C5&gt;s Station on the Follo Line, 38,65 kilometres from Oslo Central Station.14
Service
Vestby Station is served by the line 550 towards Moss of the Oslo Commuter Rail, which is operated by the Norwegian State Railways.15 The line runs between Spikkestad and Moss, through Oslo on the Spikkestad Line and Follo Line, respectively.16 The service has two southbound stations before reaching Moss; Sonsveien and Kambo.17 Travel time to Oslo Central Station is 33 minutes and to Moss 16 minutes.1819 The public transport authority Ruter operates bus services to the station from the conurbations around Vestby.20
