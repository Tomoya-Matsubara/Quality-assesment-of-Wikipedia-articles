Plot
Yashvardhan &quot;Yash&quot; Raichand (Amitabh Bachchan) is a rich businessman, living in New Delhi with his wife Nandini (Jaya Bachchan) and his two sons, Rahul and Rohan. The elder son, Rahul is adopted whilst Rohan is their biological son. As a result, Rahul feels indebted to his parents when he finds out (at the age of eight) about his adoption. As an adult, Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) falls in love with Anjali Sharma (Kajol), a girl belonging to a lower social standing than him, against the wishes of Yash, who wants him to marry Naina Kapoor (Rani Mukerji). Rahul, however, rebels and marries Anjali, following which Yash disowns Rahul as his son. Disheartened, Rahul leaves for London with his wife. Nandini sends Sayeeda (Farida Jalal), Rahul and Rohan's nanny, after Rahul to take care of him. Meanwhile, Rohan is sent to a boarding school, as per family tradition.
Ten years later, a grown-up Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) finds out the truth about Rahul's disappearance. He asks his parents to let him go to London to attend graduate school; but he does so in order to conspire with Anjali's sister, Pooja &quot;Poo&quot; Sharma (Kareena Kapoor) to bring his brother back home. Poo informs Rahul that Rohan is her friend's cousin who has shifted from India to London to pursue his studies and needs a place to stay. Rahul reluctantly agrees to let him live with them. When Rahul eventually finds out about Rohan's identity, Rohan begs of him to return home. Rahul refuses, as he believes that Yash does not love him. Poo, however, believes that Rahul will go back home, so she encourages Rohan to invite his parents over to London and arrange for them to meet Rahul. Once in London, Nandini and Rahul share a happy reunion. But Rahul refuses to talk to his father. Meanwhile, Yash finds out about the conspiracy and is furious with Rohan. He and Nandini, however, return to India due to the sudden death of his mother (Achala Sachdev).
Rahul, who also joins Yash and Rohan during the funeral service, agrees to return home for one visit to meet his mother, on the insistence of Rohan and Poo. Once there, Yash expresses his guilt for disowning his elder son, and adds that Rahul was foolish enough for believing that his father did not love him. The film ends with an elaborate wedding ceremony of Rohan and Poo, in which the entire family participates.
Cast
Amitabh Bachchan as Yashvardhan &quot;Yash&quot; Raichand, a New Delhi-based businessman. Fiercely dominating, he insists on controlling the life of his wife and sons. Amitabh Bachchan was Karan's first choice for the portrayal of Yash Raichand. Karan added, &quot;As I wrote the film, I realised that Yashvardhan Raichand is the backbone of the film and I could only see one actor playing the role - Amitabh Bachchan.&quot; Bachchan, on his part, agreed to do the film without a script narration.1 Karan mentioned that he was initially scared to direct a star of the stature of Bachchan, but the latter &quot;soon became an actor instead of a superstar&quot;.2
Jaya Bachchan as Nandini Raichand, Yash's wife. She shares a close bond with her sons, but remains in the shadow of her husband. According to Karan Johar, Jaya Bachchan was the &quot;obvious&quot; choice for the character of Nandini, and added that her &quot;acting prowess and stature&quot; were the other reasons for him preferring to cast her.3 The film also marked the return of Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan together on screen after a gap of 18 years.4 Of her character, she said that Nandini was an extension of her own self. She elaborated, &quot;My personal feelings towards Shah Rukh are similar to what I was supposed to portray in the film. There's something about him that makes me want to mother him.&quot; She added that she modeled her character on Karan's mother, Hiroo Johar, who &quot;is a very emotional and sentimental person.&quot;5
Shahrukh Khan as Rahul Raichand, Yash and Nandini's adopted son. He feels indebted to his parents and tries to fulfill all their wishes. However, he falls in love with Anjali and invites the wrath of Yash. When Karan offered the role to Khan, he immediately agreed to do it and accommodated his dates, despite having several other commitments.6 Khan described the character of Rahul by saying, &quot;I love the vulnerability and the honesty in his eyes. He has the appeal of a boy next door. Besides, his intensity and ability to convey emotions without words is amazing.&quot;7
Kajol as Anjali Sharma Raichand, Rahul's love-interest and later, wife. She is a fun-loving Punjabi woman living in the Chandni Chowk area of Delhi. Belonging to a lower socio-economic group than the Raichand family, she is not accepted by Yash as his daughter-in-law. Karan was initially hesitant to cast Kajol in the film, as he felt that she would refuse the offer due to her recent marriage. Kajol, however, was moved to tears during the script narration and agreed to do the film.8 In an interview to Filmfare, Kajol said, &quot;One tiny fact that Karan forgot to mention during his narration was just how much Punjabi my character spoke in the film. I nearly died when I saw the lines of dialogue on the first day of shooting.&quot; However, she learnt the right pronunciation and diction with the help of Yash Johar and the crew members.9
Hrithik Roshan as Rohan Raichand, Yash and Nandini's biological son. He wants his elder brother, Rahul, to return home. Karan signed Roshan to play the character of Rohan after watching a rough cut of the latter's debut film, Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000).10 Roshan described his character as a &quot;buffer&quot; in a film that primarily focused on Amitabh Bachchan and Shahrukh Khan.11
Kareena Kapoor as Pooja &quot;Poo&quot; Sharma, Anjali's younger sister. She is a sophisticated girl, who helps Rohan in his plan to reunite Rahul with his parents. After spotting Kapoor at a party organized by Bombay Times, Karan decided to cast her immediately for the role of the glamorous diva, Poo.12 Kapoor stated that in her opinion, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... was primarily Kajol's film, and that her own character was a supporting one. In order to prepare for her role, she worked hard on her dancing skills, as she didn't want audiences to know that she couldn't dance well.13
Rani Mukerji as Naina Kapoor, a socialite girl who loves Rahul and wants to marry him, and Yashvardhan approves of her. Following the success of Karan's previous film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), which starred Khan, Kajol and Mukerji, he wanted her presence in this film too. He thus cast Mukerji in a guest appearance.14 Initially, Karan wanted her presence in the film to be a surprise, but an accidental slip by Sony Music during the promotional activities led to her discovery.15
Farida Jalal as Sayeeda / Daijan (DJ), Rahul and Rohan's nanny. On the insistence of Nandini, she follows Rahul and Anjali to London.
Simone Singh as Rukhsaar, Anjali's best friend
Alok Nath as Anjali and Pooja's father
Kavish Majmudar as the younger Rohan Raichand
Malvika Raaj as the younger Pooja Sharma16
Aryan Khan (Shahrukh Khan's real-life son) as the younger Rahul (special appearance)

Production
Development
After the success of Karan's debut film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), he began work on a story dealing with the concept of &quot;generations&quot;. The idea initially revolved around two daughters-in-law. However, on the advice of filmmaker Aditya Chopra, who thought that the male characters would be too weak, Karan decided to tweak the story-line to make it the story of two brothers.17
The inspiration behind Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... came from Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhie (1976). On being inspired by the classic, Karan quoted, &quot;What appealed to me was the fact that the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. It will look different, feel different.&quot;18 Similarly, Karan added an extra &quot;e&quot; to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons.19 In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was &quot;frothy and bubble-gummish&quot;, this one was &quot;more classy and sophisticated&quot;. He added that there would be &quot;plenty of drama&quot; in this film too, but handled more maturely.20
Before principal photography could begin, Karan and the contracted costume designers (Manish Malhotra,Shabina Khan and Rocky S.) shopped in several locations of USA, London, Milan, and New Delhi to get the right look for each of the cast members.21 Additionally, Karan had only one expectation from the contracted actors; to &quot;look good and do their job&quot;. He did not organize any rehearsals for them, except for a scene involving a climatic encounter between Amitabh Bachchan and Roshan.22 Additional production people hired included choreographer Farah Khan, production designer Sharmishta Roy and cinematographer Kiran Deohans.23
Filming
The first schedule of the film began in Mumbai on 16 October 2000, with the picturisation of the song &quot;Bole Chudiyan&quot; involving Roshan, Kapoor, Khan and Kajol. Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan joined the schedule on 20 October. Due to the immense stress caused by the presence of these actors, Karan fainted on the sets.24 However, he continued directing the rest of the song while lying in bed.25
For the first half of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., the production design team recreated Chandni Chowk in a studio at Film City of Mumbai. In order to lend authenticity, the team took several pictures of the original area and also shopped in the various alleys of Chandni Chowk.26 A palatial mansion was developed from scratch in the same studio to double as the home of the Raichand family.27 In order to lend authenticity to the house of the multi-multimillionaires, several expensive paintings were hung from the walls.28 A total of 18&lt;U+2013&gt;19 elaborate sets were constructed by Roy, as Karan wanted the look of the film to be &quot;larger-than-life&quot;.29
 The second half of the film was shot in the city of London. Karan chose to set the film there due to his fondness for the city. He added, &quot;I could have based my plot in New York City or anywhere else. But London is kind of close to my heart. I like to weave my films around London.&quot; Shooting locations include the Wales Millennium Centre, Bluewater Complex, Kent, Blenheim Palace, St Paul's Cathedral and the banks of River Thames.30 The crew faced enormous difficulties while filming an emotional scene between Jaya Bachchan and Khan at the Bluewater Complex, as a massive crowd had gathered there to watch them at work. The situation, eventually, got worse and the complex officials asked them to wrap up the shoot within two hours.31
Another song sequence (&quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot;) involving Khan and Kajol was shot with the backdrop of the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt, again a first for an Indian film.32 Due to the extreme heat, the crew could shoot only between 7 and 9 am in the morning. As a result, the song took several days to film.33 In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.34
Music
The music of the film was composed by Jatin Lalit, Sandesh Shandilya and Aadesh Shrivastava. The lyrics were provided by Sameer, except for &quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot; which was penned by Anil Pandey. A total of 11 tracks are present in the album, which was released by Sony Music on 16 October 2001.353637 Explaining the album, Karan Johar said, &quot;I wanted music that had all kinds of tunes - pop, romantic, bhangra - but one sound. It had to be larger than life.&quot; He added that Jatin-Lalit came up with three &quot;haunting melodies&quot;, while Shandilya and Shrivastava came up with the pop and bhangra songs, respectively.38 A legal suit was filed against Johar for using the song &quot;It's Raining Men&quot; in the film without obtaining prior permission.39
Upon release, the soundtrack of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... emerged as a major success by selling 25 lakh units within 30 days.40 Additionally, it became the largest selling album of the year in India.41 Writing for Rediff, Sukanya Varma praised most of the compositions, while being critical of the song &quot;Say Shava Shava&quot; due to the &quot;overdose of Punjabi emotions&quot;. She summed up by saying, &quot;The music of K3G has a presence. Hate it or love it, you certainly won't ignore it.&quot;42 Planet Bollywood gave it 8 of 10 stars, calling &quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot; the best song, and the best reason to buy the album.43 In 2002, Sony released another album titled Klub K3G, featuring remixes by Indian electronic music producers Akshai Sarin, Harshdeep Sidhu, Prempal Hans and others.44
Release and reception
Initially scheduled for a theatrical release during the Diwali celebrations of 2001, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... released a month later on 14 December.45 Due to the long duration of the film, theaters screened three shows daily, instead of four. Additionally, due to a massive rush in advance bookings, several theaters increased their ticket prices.46
The use of &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; during the film was met with criticism from a certain section of the audiences, and politicians of the Bharatiya Janata Party, for being &quot;out-of-context&quot; and &quot;insulting the national pride&quot;.47 Subsequently, a writ was issued against Dharma Productions in the Allahabad High Court by a petitioner based in Uttar Pradesh.48 However, the court did not entertain the complainant's petition.49
Critical reception
India
 In India, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... met with polarized reactions from film critics. While certain critics praised the visual richness and the performances of the cast, certain others were negative about the lengthy run time and criticized the script strength and inconsistencies. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India applauded the film and reviewed, &quot;K3G is the complete commercial banquet delivered with fabulous finesse by Karan Johar. So, go indulge yourself. Cry your heart out and surprisingly, you'll feel life's finally alive and kicking in Mumbai's dream world.&quot;50 Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the emotional sequences, as well as the choreography, production design, costumes, and cinematography. He added that Karan Johar was the real star, for creating many memorable sequences.51 Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying &quot;Dharma Productions has kept its promise in giving us a lovable film to remember in coming times.&quot; He pointed out several flaws in the script, but added that the positive aspects of the film managed to outweigh the negative ones. He quoted, &quot;K3G is one heck of an entertainer and was worth the wait&quot;.52 In the film review section of his book Bollywood: An Insider's Guide, Fuad Omar showered overwhelming praise on the film and called it a &quot;masterpiece from the first frame to the last&quot;. In summary he said, &quot;Overall Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... is without a doubt the most enthralling, entertaining, emotional and complete vision and definition of Hindi cinema I have ever seen. It is simply the perfect Hindi film.&quot;53
Contrary to the positive reviews, Anjum N., writing for Rediff, said that despite an extraordinary cast and a big budget, &quot;Karan Johar disappoints.&quot; He praised Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan's performance and noted Hrithik Roshan for holding his own against the veteran actors. However, in summary he called the film &quot;a bad remix of Mohabbatein and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;.54 Writing for The Hindu, Ziya Salam praised Kajol's performance and Karan's ability to &quot;keep the viewer occupied&quot;. She commented, &quot;Watch Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... not because of the hype which preceded its release but because in these meagre times not many have come up with better fare. The film at least partially redeems the hope surrounding it. Again, just like its name. Some joy, some disappointment.&quot;55 Namarata Joshi of Outlook gave a mixed review and said that while the film &quot;makes you laugh and cry alternately&quot;, the shenanigans were never-the-less &quot;fake and affected&quot; and &quot;monochromatic despite the profusion of colours&quot;.56
Overseas
Overseas too, the reviews were mostly mixed, with several critics praising the technical production details of the film, while being somewhat less enthusiastic about the story line. Shamaila Khan of BBC gave the film 9 out of 10 stars and praised the performances of Khan, Kajol and Kapoor. She summed up by saying, &quot;(K3G is) a well made film, with some magical moments (hilarious and weepy) and possibly the world's best looking family!&quot;57 Derek Elley of Variety said that it &quot;is a highly enjoyable, often dazzlingly staged vehicle dragged down by a sluggish final half-hour&quot;. He also praised the cinematography, and the picturisation of the song, &quot;Say Shava Shava&quot;.58 Corey K. Creekmur, of the University of Iowa, said that there were many ignored or illogical plot points and inconsistencies between the moral messages meant to be portrayed and the manner in which they came off on screen. Overall, he called the film a letdown.59
Box Office
Upon release, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... broke all opening records. The film opened to around 6 crore nett collections in its first weekend in India, with the first week total at around 13 crore nett. The domestic opening week collections were 70% higher than the previous record and never before had opening records been eclipsed by such large margins. It also set new records for the second and third week nett, by collecting 10.50 crore nett and 8 crore nett respectively.60 The film went on to become the second highest grosser of 2001 domestically, netting  in India.61

If reported on time, the film would have opened at the number 10 spot in the North American box-office.67 However, according to figures from Box Office Mojo, the film debuted at the 32nd place at the American box office during the week of 4 January 2002.68 It eventually gathered a total of $2.9 million there.69 Additionally, in 2003, the film became the first from India to be given a theatrical release in Germany.70

Analysis
Film critics and academics have analyzed Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... in several ways. In the book, Encyclopedia of Religion and Film, Eric Mazur described several &quot;mythological subtexts&quot; in the film. While mentioning the opening scene of the film, which features the Raichand family worshiping &quot;Hindu deities during the annual Diwali holiday&quot;, he explained that the scene allowed the Hindu audiences to participate in the darshan along with the characters.83
Author Rajani Mazumdar compared Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... to Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! (1994) and added that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a &quot;spectacular stage that moves across global locations&quot;.84 She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places &lt;U+2013&gt; the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk. While the Raichand house is described as &quot;expensive, almost like a museum&quot;, Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note of the use of frontal camera angles in order to ensure that the &quot;spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse&quot;.85
Writer Sangita Gopal analyzed the &quot;intensification of the aesthetic effects of Hindi cinema&quot; in the narrative scheme of the film. During the confrontation scene between Yash and Rahul Raichand, a &quot;thundering background score&quot; coupled with &quot;360&lt;U+00B0&gt; panning shots&quot; were used to build up melodrama. She added that while such scenes simply began by reprising previous face-offs in several melodramatic Hindi films (such as Mohabbatein of 2000), they gradually shifted &quot;to a more realist register as the framework moves from a sociology to a psychology of the family&quot;.86 Mazur mentioned the use of &quot;dream sequences&quot; in the film as a means of escapism. He referred to the song &quot;Suraj Hua Maddham&quot; as an extradiegetic sequence that allowed Rahul and Anjali to be physically intimate &quot;in ways that they could not in the real world of the film.&quot; He added that the characters conveyed a plethora of emotions not through extensive dialogue but through the exchange of glances, which were demonstrated by extreme close-ups on their eyes.87
Writing for the book Movie Blockbusters, Andrew Willis commented that the film was specifically written to appeal to the Indian diaspora. He explained that the film was aimed at invoking nostalgia among the large section of NRI's in Canada, United Kingdom and North America.88 In the second half of the film, Rahul and Anjali move to London, where they enjoy an affluent lifestyle, among several non-Indian neighbors and friends. However, there is a perpetual dissatisfaction among them, especially Anjali, in living away from home.89 Additionally, she dresses up in a traditional sari and performs the duties of a loyal housemaker. She also frets about her son and younger sister being &quot;too influenced&quot; by Western culture. The film, thus tries to form an emotional connection with the expatriate Indian audiences.9091
Certain academics, however, criticized the portrayal of Britishers as &quot;morally corrupt&quot;. Several sequences convey a &quot;culturally conservative&quot; and &quot;idealistic image&quot; of India, while maintaining that the diaspora living in Britain lead a life of &quot;involuntary exile&quot;. Western ideology is, however, equated with economic success, with emphasis on Western consumerism such as Starbucks and Burger King, while being critical of the society at large.92 However, another academic observed that Rohan was the only character in the film who could navigate multiple cultural spaces with ease. He seems totally at ease both at his ancestral home in India and in London. Additionally, he strikes a chord with the diaspora by arranging for the local schoolchildren in London to sing &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot;, the Indian National Anthem.93 Though the tagline for the film was &quot;It's all about loving your parents&quot;,94 some analysts noted that the film dealt with the concept of fathers trusting and loving their children.95

The book was released a few days prior to the theatrical release of the film.96979899
