Tagetes lucida - MHNT
Tagetes lucida is a perennial plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is used as a medicinal plant and as a culinary herb. The leaves have a tarragon-like flavor, with hints of anise, and it has entered the nursery trade in North America as a tarragon substitute. Common names include Mexican marigold, peric&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, Mexican mint marigold, Mexican tarragon, Spanish tarragon, Cempax&lt;U+00F3&gt;chitl and Texas tarragon.
