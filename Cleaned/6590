 This list of tallest buildings in Providence ranks high-rises in the city of Providence, Rhode Island by height. The tallest skyscraper in the city is currently the Bank of America Building, which rises 428 feet (130 meters).1 Due to the what is dubbed the Providence &quot;Renaissance&quot;, the city has been the site of several construction projects. For the most part, the new projects consist of condominium and hotel developments, though two new office buildings are also proposed.2
Among these developments is OneTen Westminster, which is set to rise 520 feet (159 meters). When completed in August 2009 it will become the tallest building in the city, breaking the then 82-year record of the Bank of America Building. OneTen would also become the first building in the city to pass the 500 foot (152 meter) threshold, sometimes given as a criterion for a skyscraper.3
Other construction projects include The Residences at the Westin (which reached its full height in February 2007) and the Waterplace condominium towers. Overall, within 3 years, Providence is expected to have 7 new skyscrapers over 200 feet (60 meters) in height.4
Tallest buildings
This list ranks existing Providence skyscrapers based on standard height measurement, which includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height. This list includes under construction buildings that have already been topped out.

The Biltmore Hotel is ranked including the height of the prominent BILTMORE sign on the top of the building. Such signs are often included in architectural heights, which is what this particular list ranks. However, other sites, such as SkyscraperPage, do not include the sign in the total height of the building. Without the sign, the Biltmore stands at 205 feet (62.5 meters), making it the 12th-tallest in Providence rather than the 9th-tallest.↩
