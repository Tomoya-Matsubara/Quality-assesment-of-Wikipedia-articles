The Dickin Medal was instituted in 1943 in the United Kingdom by Maria Dickin to honour the work of animals in war. It is a bronze medallion, bearing the words &quot;For Gallantry&quot; and &quot;We Also Serve&quot; within a laurel wreath, carried on ribbon of striped green, dark brown and pale blue.1 It is awarded to animals that have displayed &quot;conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving or associated with any branch of the Armed Forces or Civil Defence Units&quot;.2 The award is commonly referred to as &quot;the animals' Victoria Cross&quot;.345
Maria Dickin was the founder of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), a British veterinary charity. She established the award for any animal displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with British Commonwealth armed forces or civil emergency services. The medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949, to 32 pigeons, 18 dogs, 3 horses and a cat, to acknowledge actions of gallantry or devotion during the Second World War.
The awarding of the medal was revived in early 2002, to honour three dogs for their role responding to the September 11 attacks; it was also awarded to two dogs serving with Commonwealth forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq. In December 2007, 12 former recipients buried at the PDSA Animal Cemetery in Ilford, Essex, were afforded full military honours at the conclusion of a National Lottery-aided project to restore the cemetery.67
The first recipients of the award, in December 1943, were three pigeons, serving with the Royal Air Force, all of whom contributed to the recovery of air crew from ditched aircraft during the Second World War. The most recent animal to be honoured is Treo, a black Labrador, honoured for his &quot;heroic actions as an arms and explosives search dog in Afghanistan&quot;.8 As of February 2011, the Dickin Medal has been awarded 63 times.9

Notes
A ^ Rob was awarded the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 parachute drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the time so that the dog would remain with the regiment.858687
B ^ The German Shepherd Dog breed was renamed in the UK by The Kennel Club in 1919 to Alsatian Wolf Dog. During the 1920s, the Wolf Dog part of the name fell out of use and dogs of this breed were simply known as Alsatians.88 The name had been reverted in most countries by 1977 to German Shepherd Dog.89
