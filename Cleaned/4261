The Curse of the Cat People is a 1944 film directed by Gunther von Fritsch and Robert Wise and produced by Cat People producer Val Lewton.
This film is the sequel to Cat People (1942) and has many of the same characters; however the movie has a completely different story.
Plot summary
After the death of his wife Irena (Simone Simon), Oliver Reed (Kent Smith) has married former co-worker Alice Moore (Jane Randolph) and they now have a 6-year-old introverted daughter Amy (Ann Carter). But Amy is getting in trouble at school because she spends too much time daydreaming. Oliver tries to encourage her to make friends. But after Amy finds a photo of deceased cat-woman Irena, whose name is never mentioned in the house, Irena&lt;U+2019&gt;s ghost appears to her and the two strike up a friendship. At the same time, Amy befriends Julia Farren, an aging actress who is alienated from her own daughter Barbara.
Director Robert Wise&lt;U+2019&gt;s debut (codirected with Gunther von Fritsch) concentrates on childhood fantasy more than suspense and horror like the original.
