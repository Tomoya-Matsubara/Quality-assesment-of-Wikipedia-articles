Music video
Background
The music video was filmed on December 21, 2011, in Los Angeles and was directed by Hype Williams. Even though during filming Minaj tweeted: &quot;The look were about to shoot, your gonna Spazz&quot;,30 she later expressed her disliking of the end product, but eventually stated that it will be released as a result of the song becoming a single.3132 The music video premiered on October 26, 2012 on E! News.33
Synopsis
 The video begins with a rising sunset set in a fairytale like setting set in the wilderness. Two unicorns appear running across water, a reference to the movie Legend, before Minaj appears in a costume with a male companion (rumored to be Robin Hood) behind her, and special effects are displayed throughout the video. Minaj and the boy, dressed in a nobleman's attire continue to be flirtatious towards one another throughout the video, and he tries to woo Minaj, but she continues to play hard to get. The unicorns appear once more before Minaj is shown in another bizarre costume accompanied by a blonde wig. Then Minaj appears to be channeling the fairy tale princesses Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, while cooking, a knight appears before Minaj and intimidates her with his sword. She then appears to be lying inside of a glass showcase (possibly a glass &quot;coffin&quot;, as follows the story of Snow White). In the end, Nicki pulls a surprising twist by appearing as the evil Queen and seducing the male companion when he arrives to save the &quot;Snow White (Nicki)&quot; from the glass showcase.
Reception
Gina Serpe from E! News gave the video a positive review, stating: &quot;It's safe to say this video has something for everyone. Starting with Nicki herself looking damn good&quot;.34
