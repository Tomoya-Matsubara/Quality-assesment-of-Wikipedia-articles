&quot;The Wait Out&quot; is the 133rd episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld. This was the 23rd episode for the seventh season. It aired in the U.S. on May 9, 1996.
Plot
George makes an off-hand joking remark to a married couple with a rocky relationship, leading to their breakup; Elaine and Jerry make plans to move in on the separated couple, but George, troubled by the results of his comment, tries to get them back together. The man (Cary Elwes) from the couple makes the same remark to George and Susan, who acts in somewhat the same way the couple did when George made the remark. Eventually, the couple gets back together again.
Elaine starts driving again and almost makes Jerry sick while a passenger. Kramer starts wearing jeans that are so tight that he cannot get them off. Another resident asks Kramer to babysit their son, but the child mistakes Kramer's stilted gait — due to the jeans — as that of Frankenstein's Monster. Kramer runs after him, but is arrested by a cop who thinks Kramer is trying to kidnap the boy.
Episode Notes

Elaine mentions having driven in the episode &quot;The Busboy.&quot;
Cary Elwes accidentally breaks character during the dinner scene with Elaine, by mentioning his anniversary, in his natural English accent.
