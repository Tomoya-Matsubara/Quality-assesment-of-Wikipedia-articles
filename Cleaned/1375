The Kansas Republican Party is the state affiliate political party in Kansas of the United States Republican Party. The Chair of the Kansas Republican Party is Amanda Adkins. The party arose in the 19th century to oppose slavery and has been the dominant party of the state ever since.
Party platform and stances
The party's platform and stances are similar to the national platform: in the support to bear arms, support of abstinence only program funding in education, pro-life and opposition of funding for abortion, support of strong national defense and of troops and veterans. It is also similar in the support of deportation of illegal immigrants, the commitment of the use of the E-verify system by employers, opposition of amnesty in regards to immigration, and the support of English as the official language. It is similar in the promotion of a health savings account and giving individuals choices when it comes to healthcare, promoting the parents' choice in education (public, private, home-school), supporting all science-based theories on the origin of life in schools, and upholding the sanctity of marriage to be only between a man and woman.12
The party's platform differs from the national platform in the party's support of a fair tax, whereas the national party does not mention it. The state party supports the implementation of granting state-aid to post-secondary education to those who graduate early.34
Political history
 thumb | Bleeding Kansas poster protesting against the Kansas legislature to abolish slavery in the state.
The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 repealed the Missouri Compromise, which outlawed slavery above the 36&lt;U+2070&gt;30' latitude in the Louisiana territories. Anti-slavery and pro-slavery settlers hurried into Kansas in order to influence the outcome of the first election. The conflict became violent, also known as Bleeding Kansas and the Republican Party emerged to promote anti-slavery.5 The Presidential election of Abraham Lincoln v. Stephen Douglas was Kansas' first participation in an election and seventy-nine percent of its vote went to Lincoln. After Lincoln's election in 1861, Kansas entered the Union as a Free State. Kansas remained a fairly Republican state for the next thirty years. The Republican Party during that time supported &quot;free men&quot; and &quot;free soil&quot;. They promoted national development through railroad expansion, internal improvements, and banking.6
In the 1880s, the Republican Party was the party of prohibition in Kansas; they wanted stricter enforcement. In the 1890s, the Populist Party was formed by farmers who opposed the Republican Party. The Populist party gained power and won most of the elections in the 1890s.7
In the early 1900s, The Republican party regained power with the creation of the progressives. The progressive-era governors sought after the reformation of the Republican Party. In doing this, they created a standard for the Republican gubernatorial seat in Kansas. These progressive lawmakers made significant changes in the state constitution, including:
1903: Line-item veto for rights; 1911: Women's voting rights
The progressive lawmakers made changes to the U.S. Constitution as well, including:
1911: Authorized the income tax; 1913: Direct election of U.S. senators; 1919: Women's suffrage8
The party wanted decreased spending and tax cuts during the 1920s and 1930s because of the Depression. Between 1861 and 1954, Kansas has had five Democratic governors but they all only served for one term. In the 1970s, the party leaders fought for freedom of government involvement on economic matters and they wanted more government involvement on social matters, such as abortion and marriage. In 1974, Senator Bob Dole used the abortion issue to get all of the pro-life supporters to support him in his election against Representative Bill Roy.Pro-life supporters accused Roy of performing abortions and Dole won.9
In 1994, the party's polar alliance won most of the elections and quickly rose to power. The party had split into the polar alliance that controlled the party organization and the House Republican caucus and the moderates who controlled the Senate Republican caucus. The polar alliance controlled the party for the past 14 years but they did not win any governor seats. The moderates gained more power in the 2000s than the polar alliance and many have even crossed over to the Democrats. 10
Dominant political party of Kansas
The Kansas Republican Party has dominated Kansas politics since Kansas statehood in 1861. Kansas has had 45 governors: 32 Republicans, 11 Democrats, and 2 Populists. Kansas has had 33 US Senators: 28 Republicans, 3 Democrats, and 2 Populists. The last time a Democrat was elected to the Senate from Kansas was in 1932. Since 1960, the Republicans have won 102 of the 129 Congressional elections, an 80% win rate; have won all 20 U.S. Senate elections; and have won 69 of the 90 state-wide elections, a 77% win rate. The Democrats have won control of the Kansas Senate only in the 1912 election and control of the Kansas House three times in the 1912, 1976, and 1990 elections. In February 2011, the Gallup Survey classified Kansas as one of only five &quot;solidly Republican&quot; states.11
In 2010, Republican voter registration was 763,640, an increase of 22,693, while Democrat registration decreased by 9,011 to 459,181. In October 2008, Kansas voter registration numbers were 771,019 Republicans (44.4%), 484,710 Democrats (27.9%), and 482,882 (27.8%) unaffiliated voters.

Party structure
The party structure includes the following elements:83
Precincts: Kansas is divided into thousands of administrative voting districts called precincts. Precincts are not based on population and range from 0 registered voters to 2,500 voters. During the biannual primary election in August, the republican voters in each precinct may elect one precinct committeeman and one precinct committeewoman (a/k/a &quot;precinct leaders&quot;). Vacancies in precinct positions may be filled by the county party chair.
County Party: Every two years, between the primary election and 2 weeks after the general election, all the precinct committee people - the county party &quot;central Committee&quot; - hold a meeting and elect officers for the county party, a chair, vice chair, secretary and treasurer. Each of the 105 counties in Kansas has an active county party.
County Delegates: At the biannual meeting of the precinct committeemen, county delegates are elected. Each county has two automatic delegates, its chair and vice chair. Additional delegates are awarded based on the total number of republican votes from the county in the last primary election. While most counties have only 2 delegates, large counties like Sedgwick and Johnson have dozens of county delegates.
District Committee: The county delegates will assemble in a meeting, usually in December of an election year, and elect four officers (chair, vice-chair, secretary, and treasurer) and 37 delegates to the state committee.
State Committee: The state committee is made up of 37 delegates from each congressional district, the chair and vice-chair of each district, the state party officers, key elected officials and leaders of republican affiliated groups. The State Committee meets at least twice a year. Every two years the newly elected delegates elect new state party officers - a chair, vice-chair, secretary, and treasurer. During the first meeting of a Presidential election year, the state committee elects a National Committeeman and Committeewoman, who take office at the national republican convention. The state committee approves resolutions, changes to the state party constitution and by-laws, and approves the party platform every two years.
Executive Committee: The Executive committee is made up of the party officers, elected officials, leaders of republican affiliated groups, and some specially appointed and elected individuals. The Executive Committee meets at State Committee meetings and by phone several times during the year. Budgetary and other administrative duties are tasked to the executive committee.
State Party Officers: There are six party officers. The Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer, are elected every two years. The National Committeeman and Women are elected every four years. The Chair may hire an executive director and other paid staff with the approval of the Executive Committee.
Caucus
Rules: 84
The party Caucus for Presidential Preference occurs in the year of the presidential election. Each election year the Republican Party creates a selection plan that gives instructions for the Caucus. The Caucus for the 2012 Presidential election will be held on Saturday, March 10, 2010 at 10:00 AM.
The Caucus is open to voters who site their party preference as Republican and are eligible to vote. The voter must show proof that he or she is a registered Republican and they must be registered on or before February 17, 2012 (dates will change for each presidential election). There is no fee for participating in the Caucus but donations are accepted. If a person participates in the the Republican Caucus that person is not allowed to participate in the nominating process for another party during that same election.
For a Republican Presidential candidate to be registered as a candidate and be placed on the ballot, they must be registered as a candidate with the Federal Election Commission and file a &quot;declaration of candidacy&quot; with the Kansas Republican Party including a $10,000 filing fee by the end of the year before the election year. Write-in candidates are not allowed.
Congressional districts are allowed to hold as many caucuses as they need to support their community but they must hold at least one. At the actual Caucus, a representative of each campaign speaks for no longer than ten minutes about his or her candidate. Voters will vote after each presentation.
Each Congressional District must hold a District Convention to elect three delegates. Any registered Kansas Republican can be elected a delegate. Each district is allowed up to six at-large delegates and six at-large alternate delegates per district. The Congressional delegates must cast their Presidential vote for the candidate who won at the Caucus. At-large delegates and alternate delegates vote for candidates who receive more than 20% of the statewide vote of the Caucus.
Current Republican officeholders
The party controls all six statewide constitutional offices and holds a supermajority in both the Kansas House of Representatives and the Kansas Senate. Republicans also hold both U.S. Senate seats and all four U.S. House seats.

Film
In their documentary How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories, filmmakers Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini provide a behind-the-scenes look at Kansas Republican Party politics and the party's response to the issue of immigration in the early-2000s.
&quot;Story Three: You Never Know&quot; uses the 2002 Kansas Republican primaries as a case-study for the on-going debates within the Republican party. It focuses on the 2002 trip of David Kensinger, Sam Brownback&lt;U+2019&gt;s Chief of Staff, from Capitol Hill to guide to three conservative Kansas candidates who challenge mainstream party nominees.
&quot;Story Four: Sam in the Snow&quot; focuses largely on (then Senator) Sam Brownback's commitment to push forward comprehensive immigration reform in 2002, and the obstacles posed by the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The film also chronicles his choice between the Senate Judiciary Committee with a likely position as chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee and a coveted seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. The film's title refers to Brownback.91
