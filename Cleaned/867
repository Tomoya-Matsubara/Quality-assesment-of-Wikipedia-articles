Background
On January 17, 2013, DJ Khaled announced that he had already started working on his seventh album and that it would be titled Suffering from Success.1 In January 2013, during an interview with MTV News DJ Khaled explained where the album title came from, saying:
&quot;We just got done turning in Ross&lt;U+2019&gt; album, and you know people don&lt;U+2019&gt;t realize, when you turn in an album, it&lt;U+2019&gt;s a lot of work behind the scenes; from clearing records, dealing with lawyers, sample clearances, mix and mastering, marketing plan. At that time, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m running around and I notice a big bald spot on my beard that kept getting bigger and bigger. I&lt;U+2019&gt;m acting like I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t want to see it, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m brushing it away and it kept getting it bigger and bigger. So When I finally got home off the road, I was like you know what, &lt;U+2018&gt;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m gonna go to the doctors.&lt;U+2019&gt; I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t like going to the doctors, so I go, and she&lt;U+2019&gt;s like it&lt;U+2019&gt;s a disorder that comes from your nerves and your stress, but she said &lt;U+2018&gt;I&lt;U+2019&gt;m going to give you medication, and I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll see you back in 4 months.&lt;U+2019&gt; Through that whole process while I&lt;U+2019&gt;m at the doctor&lt;U+2019&gt;s office, my phone&lt;U+2019&gt;s ringing, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m dealing with marketing people, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m dealing with lawyers, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m dealing with Ross, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m dealing with personal shit, a whole bunch of shit at the same time. It didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t stop, she&lt;U+2019&gt;s thinking I&lt;U+2019&gt;m crazy. So she gave me my medicine and all that, and she found out who I was, and after watching that 45 minute doctor&lt;U+2019&gt;s session, she grabbed my shoulder and she just goes, &lt;U+2018&gt;Son, you&lt;U+2019&gt;re suffering from success.&lt;U+2019&gt; I looked at her and was like, &lt;U+2018&gt;That might be the realest thing you can tell me, and it opened my mind up like, success comes with stress, and happiness. So Im driving home from the doctor&lt;U+2019&gt;s office and I&lt;U+2019&gt;m like, &lt;U+201C&gt;that&lt;U+2019&gt;s gonna be the name of my new album, Suffering From Success.&lt;U+2019&gt;&quot;2
