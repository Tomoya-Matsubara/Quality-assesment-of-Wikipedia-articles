Mar Joseph II Sliba Maruf (or Youssef II Sliba Bet Macruf) was the second incumbent of the Josephite line of Church of the East, a little patriarchate in Full Communion with the pope active in the areas of Amid and Mardin in the 17th-19th century, thus being the Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church from 1696 to 1713.
Life
Sliba Maruf was born in 16671 in Tel Keppe&lt;U+200E&gt;, Iraq, received first orders at fourteen2 and was consecrated bishop, without the previous consent of Rome, at the age of 24 in 1691 by Joseph I3. He was chosen by Joseph I as his successor in 1694, but this appointment became effective only when Rome accepted his predecessor resignation in 1696. Thus Sliba Maruf was confirmed patriarch by Holy See on June 18, 16964, with the name of Joseph II.
As happened for Joseph I, his ministry had to face the strong opposition of the traditionalists5. This forced him in 1708 to ask permission to Rome to resign and move to Italy, a request that was not granted.
During the plague that spreaded from 1708 he distinguish himself for the help and the pastoral care he offered to the sicks6 untill he too was infected. Early in 1713 he choose as successor Timothy Maroge and died of plague a few months later in 171378 (or according other sources in 1712) at the age of 46.
Works
Joseph is remembered as Syriac and Arab writer and for having translated many texts from Latin. His Speculum tersum (Book of the pure Mirror) was translated in Latin from Syriac by I. A. Assemani and is conserved in the Vatican Library9.
