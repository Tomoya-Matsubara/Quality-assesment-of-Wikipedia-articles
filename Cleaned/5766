History
Medieval
 Early medieval artifacts of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; include dress items and weaponry found in fifth and sixth century cemeteries, which display the high status and the wealth of the burials. Originally a middle-sized fortress like other urban centers of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; expanded to a town probably from the sixth to the ninth century AD.3 In 1190 Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; became the capital of the first autonomous Albanian state of the middle ages, the Principality of Arb&lt;U+00EB&gt;r founded by Progon of the House of Progon.4 During the reign of Gulam of Albania the principality was dissolved and incorporated in the newly founded Kingdom of Albania and later by the House of Thopia. After 1389 it became the capital of the Principality of Kastrioti under Gjon Kastrioti, father of the national hero of the Albanians Skanderbeg. In 1395 the town was briefly captured by the Ottoman Empire, while from 1410 to 1415 it was ruled by Nikit&lt;U+00EB&gt; Thopia.5
In the early 15th century the city was conquered again by the Ottoman Empire and then recaptured in 1443 by Skanderbeg, who in 1438 had been appointed subasi (governor) of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;.6 In 1444 Skanderbeg incorporated it in the League of Lezh&lt;U+00EB&gt;, the confederation of the Albanian principalities. From 1450 until 1477 Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; was defended successfully by the Albanian troops four times against the Ottoman army, which eventually captured it in 1478 during the fourth Siege of the city. In the first siege of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; in 1450 the 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers of the League of Lezh&lt;U+00EB&gt; under Vrana Konti and Skanderbeg defeated an Ottoman force of about 100,000 men led by Sultan Murad II, who during the siege tried to bribe Konti to surrender the castle of the town. In the following decade Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; was first besieged in 1466 and then in 1467 unsuccessfully by Ballaban Pasha and Sultan Mehmed II, whose total troops were about 150,000. After Skanderbeg's death in 1468 in the city's garrison were added troops of the Republic of Venice. In 1476 the town was once more besieged by a ten-thousand-man army under Gedik Ahmed Pasha, however, the local garrison led by proveditor Pietro Vetturi fended off the Ottoman besiegers, who retreated after the arrival of reinforcements under Francesco Contarini and Nikoll&lt;U+00EB&gt; Dukagjini. The city was eventually conquered by the Ottomans in 1478 after being besieged for over a year.7
Modern
During the rise Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; became the battlefield of various anti-Ottoman rebellions also related with the imposition of new taxes. In 1906 the people of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; revolted once more against the Ottoman empire.8 The W&lt;U+0101&gt;li of Shkod&lt;U+00EB&gt;r, Sali Zeki Pasha sent four battalions of the Ottoman army stationed in the city against the rebels of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;. After prolonged confrontations the Ottoman officials offered to begin negotiations with the rebels. On September 20, 1906 the leaders of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; and the Ottoman diplomats met at the Tallajbe quarter of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; to discuss the administrative status of the town, however, the Ottoman army under &lt;U+015E&gt;emsi Pasha ambushed the rebel leaders.9 During the battle that followed, which became known in history after the Tallajbe district, about 30 people died including uninvolved civilians.1011
Throughout the Albanian Revolt of 1912, that led to the creation of the Albanian Vilayet and later in the Declaration of Independence of Albania Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;, which was captured on August 14, was one of the major anti-Ottoman centers.12 In 1914 Essad Toptani, a member of the notable Toptani family of the region and officer of the Ottoman army, captured the town and incorporated it in the Republic of Central Albania making it a center of his movement, but in June of the same year it was reincorporated by Pr&lt;U+00EA&gt;nk Bib&lt;U+00EB&gt; Doda in the Principality of Albania.1314 On December 20, 1914 the local anti-Essadist led by Abdi Toptani, Minister of Finance of Albania and cousin of Essad Toptani, and Mehmet Gjinali, Union of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; was formed, which quickly extended its authority in central Albania.1516
Following the Italian invasion of Albania the country became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. Mustafa Merlika-Kruja, a native of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;, who became the Prime Minister of the new regime ordered the formation of a 300-man gendarmerie force to defend the town against resistance groups. However, soon after resistance leader Abaz Kupi, another native of the town, created one of the first permanent resistance forces of Albania in Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; and gradually took control of the region.17 In 1943 at the assembly of Tapiz&lt;U+00EB&gt; Balli Komb&lt;U+00EB&gt;tar proposed to the LN&lt;U+00C7&gt; the creation of provisional resistance government, with Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; as the capital city, but this proposal was rejected by the LN&lt;U+00C7&gt; leaders.18 In the end of November 1944, the last German troops stationed in the area were defeated and LN&lt;U+00C7&gt; battalions entered the town.
Culture
In antiquity Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; was a site used for pagan rituals, while after the spread of Christianity a church dedicated to Saint Alexander was built near Mount Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt;. In the Ottoman era in the area of the church a tekke dedicated to the Bektashi saint Sari Saltik was built.19 In 1789-99 the Dollma tekke was built by the Dollma family near the castle. The museums of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; include the Skanderbeg museum and the national ethnographic museum. The Skanderbeg museum, founded in 1982, was built in the environs of the Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; castle. Its collection includes mostly 15th century artifacts related to the Albanian-Ottoman wars, during which the castle was besieged four times by the Ottoman army.20 The national ethnographic museum of Kruj&lt;U+00EB&gt; was founded in 1989 and is located in a 15-6 room villa of the Toptani family built in 1764. The main exhibits of the museum are objects of artisanship, whose age varies from 60 to 500 years.21
