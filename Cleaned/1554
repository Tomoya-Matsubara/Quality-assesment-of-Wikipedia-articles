AdaCamp is a series of unconferences organized by the Ada Initiative. AdaCamp is the only conference that focuses on women's participation in open technology and culture, including the development of free and open source software and contributions to projects like Wikipedia.12 AdaCamps are among the projects and resources the Ada Initiative provides to make workplaces more friendly for women.3
AdaCamps have been held in Melbourne (January 2012),4 Washington, D.C. (July 2012),5 and San Francisco (June 2013).6 One hundred women from 10 countries participated at the July 2012 event, and it was larger than the initial Melbourne AdaCamp.78
Cofounder Valerie Aurora said that the reasons for AdaCamp included &quot;to make progress quickly on difficult problems, to share knowledge, and to network with each other.&quot;9 As an unconference, attendees lead sessions on subjects that they choose.10 Along with women interested in open source software, attendees can include women interested in open access, open education,11 hackerspaces, digital liberties activism, wiki culture, and other topics.12
