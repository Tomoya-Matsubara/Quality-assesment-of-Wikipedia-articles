In the U.S. state of Iowa, Interstate 29 (I-29) is a north&lt;U+2013&gt;south Interstate Highway which closely parallels the Missouri River. I-29 enters Iowa from Missouri near Hamburg and heads to the north-northwest through the Omaha-Council Bluffs and the Sioux City areas. It exits the state by crossing the Big Sioux River into South Dakota. For its entire distance through the state, it runs on the flat land between the Missouri River and the Loess Hills.
I-29 was built in sections over a period of 15 years. When there was a shortage of male workers, female workers stepped in to build a  section near Missouri Valley. Between Council Bluffs and Sioux City, I-29 replaced U.S. Route 75 (US 75) as the major route in western Iowa. As a result of I-29's creation, US 75 south of Sioux City was relocated into Nebraska.
Route description
Interstate 29 enters Iowa south of Hamburg. The interstate heads northwest, where it meets Iowa Highway 333 (Iowa 333) at a diamond interchange. From Hamburg, I-29 continues to the northwest for  where it meets Iowa 2  east of Nebraska City, Nebraska. North of the Iowa 2 interchange, the interstate straightens out to the north; interchanges serving Percival, Thurman, and Bartlett are spaced out every . Near Pacific Junction, I-29 is joined by US 34 for . At the same interchange where US 34 splits away near Glenwood, I-29 is joined by US 275.1  North of Glenwood, I-29 / US 275 continue north towards Council Bluffs. The two routes meet Iowa 370, which crosses into Nebraska providing access to Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue, Nebraska. Near Lake Manawa, US 275 splits away from I-29 at the Iowa 92 interchange.  north of the split, the interstate is joined from the east by Interstate 80. The two interstates head west together through southern Council Bluffs for . When the two interstates split at a Y interchange, I-80 immediately crosses the Missouri River into Nebraska, and I-29 immediately turns to the north. Two miles (3.2 km) to the north is a modified Y interchange with US 6 and the eastern end of I-480.2
North of Council Bluffs, I-29 is joined by I-680 near Crescent. The two interstates travel north together for  before I-680 splits off to the east near Loveland. I-29 continues north for  to Missouri Valley, where it intersects US 30. North of Missouri Valley, the interstate turns to the northwest towards Modale and then straightens out again south of Mondamin, where I-29 meets the western end of Iowa 127. From Mondamin, it travels north for  to the Iowa 175 interchange at Onawa, passing Little Sioux and Blencoe.3  North of Onawa, I-29 continues northwest for  towards Sloan, where it meets the western end of Iowa 141. As it approaches the Sioux City metro area, it passes the Sioux Gateway Airport at Sergeant Bluff. At the Singing Hills Boulevard interchange, northbound is joined by southbound U.S. Route 75 Business (US 75 Bus.). One mile (1.6 km) later, US 75 Bus. ends at the cloverleaf interchange with US 20 / US 75, which is also the eastern end of Interstate 129.4
For the next  north of the I-129 interchange, I-29 runs closely, as close as , to the Missouri River. The interstate follows the curve of the river and turns to the west. It meets Gordon Drive, which carries US 20 Bus. US 20 Bus. traffic is directed onto the interstate for  before it exits via a volleyball interchange which represents the national northern end of U.S.&amp;nbsp;Route&amp;nbsp;77.5 I-29 continues west along the Missouri River, and after the Big Sioux River converges into the Missouri, I-29 follows the Big Sioux. Shortly before it crosses the Big Sioux into South Dakota, Iowa 12 splits away to the north.6
History
 Construction of Interstate 29 began in the late 1950s in the Sioux City area. The first section to open, a  long stretch from the Big Sioux River to the then-US 20 / US 77 bridge across the Missouri River, opened around October 1, 1958. In September 1961, I-29 was extended across the Big Sioux River to South Dakota. On April 1, 1962, one of the directional spans collapsed  as a result of flooding, but did not fall into the river.7
North of Council Bluffs, a  section to Missouri Valley opened in November 1958. By December 1967, the two sections were connected, creating  of continuous interstate highway.8 Due to a shortage of male workers, at least 20 women were enlisted to help build this section of I-29. The women were paid $2.00 hourly ($ hourly in  dollars), the same wage as men would have earned.9
Construction of I-29 in the Council Bluffs area was completed in 1970 and the route was open to Glenwood in the same year. Additional interchanges were added in the Sioux City and Council Bluffs areas between 1970 and 1971. The last  of interstate were constructed and opened in sections over the next two years; the last section opened on December 15, 1972.10
In 1973, US 34 was expanded to four lanes near Glenwood, which resulted in US 34 being rerouted onto I-29 for .11 In 2003, US 275 was rerouted onto I-29 from the same interchange near Glenwood northward to Iowa 92 at Council Bluffs. The former US 275 alignment was turned over to Mills and Pottawattamie Counties.12
Much of I-29 was built next to existing highways, most notably US 75. When the section of I-29 opened between Council Bluffs and Missouri Valley, US 75 was rerouted onto I-29.13 When construction connecting the Sioux City and Council Bluffs segments was completed, US 75 was again rerouted onto I-29.14 In the mid-1980s, US 75, from Council Bluffs to Sioux City, was completely rerouted out of Iowa, instead extending up the former US 73 corridor in Nebraska.15
