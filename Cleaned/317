&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic is the eponymous debut album by American parodist Alfred Matthew &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Mostly recorded in March 1982, the album was released as an LP and on Compact Cassette in 1983 by Rock 'n Roll Records,12 and on Compact Disc on March 12, 1991 by Volcano Records.3
Consisting of five direct parodies and seven original songs, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parodies pop and rock music of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and satirizes American culture and experiences of the same time period. The album, which was produced and engineered by Rick Derringer and Peter Kelsey respectively,4 received a lukewarm reception by critics and reviewers.
Production
 After hearing Yankovic's parody of his song &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot;, songwriter Jake Hooker suggested to &quot;ace rock guitarist&quot; Rick Derringer that he would be the perfect producer for the burgeoning parodist. Agreeing, Derringer used his music industry prestige and convinced Cherokee Studios to record an album's worth of Yankovic's songs gratis, to be paid from sales revenue. Then, in March 1982, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic stepped into a professional recording studio for the first time and recorded nine of the songs for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic.5 
After encountering difficulty picking up a record label for the first-time album, Jay Levey (a Los Angeles artists' manager) provided KIQQ-FM with a copy of &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;. Impressing the program director of the Top 40 station, he played it immediately; &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; was one of the most-requested songs by the next day. At the same time, Tad Dowd&lt;U+2014&gt;head of the new record label, Rock 'n Roll Records&lt;U+2014&gt;had been trying to convince parent company Scotti Brothers Records to sign the 22-year-old Yankovic. The positive furor over the KIQQ playtest provided Dowd with the leverage needed to convince Scotti Bros. to offer a contract for Yankovic's first album.6
Scotti Brothers Records' contract planned an April 1983 release date for a twelve-track album: &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot; and eight other tracks were already recorded, &quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot; would be the original 1980 live recording from The Dr. Demento Show, and the last two songs (&quot;Ricky&quot; and &quot;Buckingham Blues&quot;) would be recorded at Scotti Brothers' own studios in Santa Monica, California.78
Promotion
 To promote the album, Levy coordinated a three-week tour in late Summer 1983 across the United States' East Coast and Midwest for both Yankovic and Dr. Demento. Promoted as &quot; An Evening of Dementia with Dr. Demento in Person Plus 'Weird Al' Yankovic&quot;, Demento opened with recorded hits and short comedy films from his show before introducing Yankovic and the band. During their three weeks, the tour played in several famous clubs, including Bottom Line in New York City.9
Album cover
The album cover for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic was designed by Brazilian artist Rogerio. The band chose Rogerio because of his &quot;[[Mad (magazine)|MAD Magazine]]-like drawing style.&quot;1011 The cover art specifically features individual elements that correspond with each of the album's twelve songs.12
Critical reception
Eugene Chadbourne, reviewer for allmusic, felt that while &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic was a detailed harbinger of parody to come, the album does not hold up well on its own. Chadbourne extolled most of the parodies (&quot;Another One Rides the Bus&quot;, &quot;My Bologna&quot;, &quot;I Love Rocky Road&quot;) for their comedic value in contrast with their originals&lt;U+2014&gt;songs he supposed to be &quot;pretentious [&amp;] overblown&quot;. However, also according to Chadbourne, &quot;Ricky&quot; lacks the comedic connection Yankovic cultivates in later albums, and the original songs &quot;may not seem like they were written in ten minutes, but the ideas behind them don't seem to involve that much contemplation. [They're] like little bits of puff [whose ...] impact on the flow of an album side is more like ballast.&quot;13
Introducing Yankovic as the guest DJ for All Songs Considered on National Public Radio in 2006, host Bob Boilen opined that upon his debut, Yankovic &quot;seemed the epitome of throw-away novelty act&quot;.14
Reviewing Yankovic in 2008, Brian Raftery of Wired magazine wrote that &quot;Ricky&quot; introduced the world to &quot;an accordion-playing spaz with a coif like Rick James and a voice like an urgent goose.&quot; In 1983, Yankovic was considered a fad of the time&lt;U+2014&gt;comparing him to parachute pants and Contras&lt;U+2014&gt;and &quot;thoroughly disposable.&quot;15
Musical databasing and review websites allmusic and Artistdirect rate &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic three and a half out of five stars.1617
Track listing
&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic is the only album in Yankovic's discography in which the accordion is prevalent in every song; in subsequent albums it's only used where deemed appropriate or wholly inappropriate for comedic effect.18

Other songs
&quot;It's Still Billy Joel to Me&quot;, Yankovic's 1980 parody of Billy Joel's &quot;It's Still Rock and Roll to Me&quot;, was originally planned for this album. Wary of the song being considered &quot;dated&quot; three years later, and doubtful that Joel would give his blessing, the band never bothered to ask.24 &lt;!--
&quot;The Ballad of Chuck and Diane&quot;, a parody of John Mellencamp's hit &quot;Jack and Diane&quot; was scheduled for the album. Mellencamp was fine with the idea of a parody; however, upon hearing there was going to be a movie based on the song, Yankovic changed the song into an original to avoid legal trouble (the film never got off the ground). The new song was called &quot;Buckingham Blues&quot;.25 He eventually parodied the song for his guest appearance on The Simpsons, as &quot;Homer and Marge&quot;26 --&gt;
Yankovic's parody of The Kinks' song &quot;Lola&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;&quot;Yoda&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;was written in 1980 (during the initial theatre run of The Empire Strikes Back), and a &quot;huge hit&quot; on The Dr. Demento Show. However, the complexities of receiving permission from filmmaker George Lucas and the Kinks' publishers delayed its release until 1985.27
