A cell survival curve is a curve used in radiobiology.
It depicts the relationship between the fraction of cells retaining their reproductive integrity and the absorbed dose.
Conventionally, the surviving fraction is depicted on a logarithmic scale, and is plotted on the y-axis against dose on the x-axis.
