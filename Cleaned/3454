Alphonse &quot;Buddy&quot; Fletcher, Jr. (born 1966) is an African-American philanthropist who had previously been a successful money manager. Fletcher first became notable when employed by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. During this time, he had an agreement entitling him to 25% of the profits he earned for the firm. However, when he generated $25 million one year, the firm did not uphold its agreement, and Fletcher sued for racial discrimination and US$3 million in back pay. He eventually won an arbitration award of $1.3 million.
Fletcher had worked at Bear Stearns before working for Kidder and founded his own firm, Fletcher Asset Management, after the dispute with Kidder Peabody. Having donated tens of millions of dollars to various charitable causes, Fletcher has become a major philanthropist. He has established several lasting legacies with his charitable efforts; two such efforts include the establishment of the Fletcher Foundation and the endowment of a University Professorship at Harvard University. He has also been a serious contender for statewide public office in the United States state of New York.

Fletcher, Jr. was raised in .1 His father Alphonse Sr. was a technician at the Electric Boat Corporation in Groton,23 a company famous for making submarines; his mother Bettye, a long-time teacher and later a social worker, a Dean, and school principal, received a Ph.D. in Education from Teachers College, Columbia University.45 Fletcher has two younger brothers whose Harvard educations he helped pay for. His brother Geoffrey S. Fletcher is an Academy Award-winning screenwriter. Fletcher describes his parents as aspiring.6 Unlike his younger brothers Todd who attended Phillips Academy and Geoffrey who attended Choate Rosemary Hall, Fletcher attended public schools in Waterford.7
In college, Fletcher excelled scholastically, and he was a well-respected quarterback on his intramural football team.8 He also endowed the Alphonse Fletcher Sr. Fellowship program, named after his late father.910 Fletcher's mother remarried Yale professor Dr. James P. Comer.11 Comer founded the Comer School Development Program and Maurice Falk Professor of Child Psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center.12 Fletcher has lived on the Upper West Side in The Dakota1314 He also owns property in .15. Mr. Fletcher and his wife, Ellen K. Pao, are Trustees for the Inauguration of Barack Obama.16
Early life and education
Fletcher's first experience with investment, risk and return occurred when he was in junior high school. He and his father developed a computer program to determine dogs to invest in at the dog racing tracks. His program was able to select dogs that would win place or show, but due to the odds of the dogs it was selecting and the commission that the race track extracted, his work was not profitable.17
He attended Harvard College where he received an A.B. degree as an applied mathematics major in 1987.18 He was elected first marshall (class president) of the 1987 class.19 He earned a Master&lt;U+2019&gt;s degree in Environmental Management from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.20 While an undergraduate student, he was enrolled in the United States Air Force Reserve Officers' Training Corps Aerospace Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.21 Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and served in the United States Air Force Ready Reserve until his honorable discharge in 1997.2223
One of his college internships was with Pfizer, where through the employee stock ownership program he learned the principal of investing in discounted assets. This was his first experience purchasing stocks.24
Professional career
The United States National Defense budget cuts caused people to encourage Fletcher to find a private sector job despite his ROTC training. After graduating from college in 1987, he became a trader for Bear Stearns.25 He was subsequently hired by Kidder Peabody where he emerged as an elite trader. After his tenure at Kidder Peabody he founded Fletcher Asset Management.2627 Fletcher began his career as quantitative equity trader who capitalized on dividend-related arbitrage.28 At Bear Stearns he had worked in the options department, but at Kidder he worked in the equity trading group.29 He also buys discounted equity stakes in companies, many of which are in restrictive liquidity positions which have caused the discounting of otherwise fundamentally sound investments.30
Alphonse Fletcher vs. Kidder Peabody
By age 25, Fletcher was Kidder's top equity trader, and he was earning $2 million a year.31 At the time, Kidder was owned by General Electric (GE).32 As part of his relationship with Kidder, the company agreed to pay him one quarter of the profits that he made for the firm, but when he earned the firm $25 million dollars, they only paid him half of the amount promised. He sued for the other half ($3 million in back pay).33 In addition to the pay dispute he filed a $5 million dollar (plus punitive damages) discrimination suit.34 Fletcher claimed the firm had kept their promise to white employees and claimed racial discrimination because white employees were paid more generously for similar work.35 Alleging a violation of State Human Rights Law, Fletcher filed a discrimination claim in the New York State Courts.36 The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division ruled that an arbitration panel would hear his case.37
Jurisdiction in the case was a hotly contested matter. In the Individual Assignment System (IAS) of the New York Supreme Court, Fletcher sued Kidder under the New York State Human Rights Law, alleging racial discrimination in employment in violation of Executive Law &lt;U+00A7&gt; 296(1)(a). In response, Kidder moved to stay the judicial proceedings and compel arbitration on the basis of the broad arbitration clause that they had signed during securities exchange registration applications. Fletcher contended that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which preempts state law, mandated enforcement of Kidder's promise to submit &quot;controversies ... arising out of [his] employment&quot; to arbitration. The IAS court denied the motion, reasoning that &quot;it would be against public policy to contract in advance for a waiver of the right to obtain judicial redress of alleged racial discrimination.&quot; The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, however, &quot;reversed and granted the requested relief after concluding that the FAA and the cases decided under that statute mandated enforcement of [Kidder's] arbitration agreement&quot;.38 The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case.39 Fletcher eventually won an arbitration award of $1.3 million.40
Fletcher Asset Management
When Fletcher started Fletcher Asset Management (FAM), he was identified by Fortune in 1994 as the top earning member of their thirty talented individuals under the age of thirty.41 During the firm's first four years, it traded with heavy leverage.42 When he founded his firm as chairman and CEO, he located it on the 48th floor of the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue.43 Fletcher had audited returns of 471% in 1992 and 177% in 1993, and unaudited returns of 267% in 1994 through August 31.44 During his first five years in business after founding his firm in 1991, the firm's audited annual returns were 350%. His general strategy was trading public instruments for his own account and on behalf of clients, but he also made longer-term equity investments. He used sophisticated hedges with both types of investments.45 He has also been involved in PIPE deals.46 At various times he has been chauffeured to work in a Mercedes-Benz,47 a Bentley,48 and a Jaguar.49
At first Fletcher hired 22 employees, but quickly found himself overstaffed.50 In 1994 he employed 11 workers.51 By 1996, his firm employed 25 people.52 His firm's trading activity often accounts for 5% of the volume on the New York Stock Exchange, and former boss and mentor Alan Greenberg describes him as a smart winner.53 In 1994, Fletcher surrendered his broker-dealer registration and became a registered investment adviser, which made managing money more convenient.54 Although his entrepreneurial firm has thrived, he never dreamed of entrepreneurial enterprise and had hoped to be a GE executive someday.55
Public office
Alan G. Hevesi won the 2006 New York Comptroller election on November 7, 2006, but resigned from his four-year term the following month after pleading guilty to a felony for using a state worker as a driver and aide for his wife. Fletcher was among a field of eighteen candidates who submitted r&lt;U+00E9&gt;sum&lt;U+00E9&gt;s to the New York State Legislature in January 2007. Eventual selection Thomas DiNapoli was an immediate front runner for the position.56 Fletcher had been convinced to enter his name by various public supporters.57 Other notable candidates were New York State Legislature members Richard Brodsky, Joseph Morelle, Felix Ortiz, Pete Grannis, and Martin Connor; and State and local officials Andrew SanFilippo, Martha Stark, and Andrew Eristoff.58
Philanthropy
In 1993, following the death of friend and advisor Reginald Lewis, Fletcher donated $1 million to the Reginald F. Lewis Memorial Endowment. The endowment had been created by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People after Lewis instructed his wife to bequeath $2 million to the organization.59
In 1996, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Plessy v. Ferguson, , Fletcher endowed a University professorship at Harvard College with a $4.5 million dollar donation. The Alphonse Fletcher, Jr. chair belongs to a special category of endowed positions established in 1935 as Harvard's highest professorial distinction.6061 Unlike professors employed by a department or a school, University professors are free to teach courses in any discipline that they desire. The chair was intended to be held, &quot;whenever possible, by a faculty member from one of the professional schools who is devoted to teaching and research about contemporary moral, religious, and social values, and whose interests include undergraduate education.&quot;62 Before leaving for Princeton University, Cornel West held this chair.63 In 2006, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. became the Fletcher University Professor.64
In 2004, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, , Fletcher pledged $50 million to create the Fletcher Foundation to give money to institutions and individuals working to improve race relations.65 The donation rivals prior gifts by Oprah Winfrey and Bill Cosby as one of the largest ever by an African-American.6667 The fellowships are awarded to individuals who improve race relations in a manner that promotes the broad social goals of the Brown v. Board of Education decision that outlawed segregation in public schools.68 The $50,000 fellowships are awarded to educators, lawyers, scientists, artists, economists, writers, doctors and others.69 Among those advising him on uses of the pledged money were Henry Louis Gates, K. Anthony Appiah, Amy Gutmann, and Thelma Golden.70
In 2006, Fletcher was part of a consortium of individuals who created a $50 million Professorship Challenge Fund at Harvard University. The fund provides matching funds that encourages gifts to endow named professorships and provide faculty support across the University.71
Fletcher has supported schools, churches and community organizations in Harlem; donated encyclopedic and educational materials to public schools throughout Connecticut, New York City, and several large cities; and sponsored exhibits at the New York Historical Society, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Studio Museum in Harlem.7273 Fletcher has also supported the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health.74
Awards
Fletcher earned the 1999 Ernst &amp; Young New York City &quot;Entrepreneur of the Year&quot;, 2002 Sponsors for Educational Opportunity &quot;Leadership Award&quot;, 2004 United Negro College Fund &quot;Extraordinary Black Man Award&quot;, 2005 Harvard University Gay and Lesbian Caucus &quot;Civil Rights Award&quot;, and 2006 Morehouse College &quot;Candle in the Dark&quot;.75 In explaining why he had been awarded the 2005 Harvard University Gay and Lesbian Caucus award, Tom Parry, president of the HGLC, said that Fletcher had distinguished himself, not just as a philanthropist but as someone who had worked tirelessly to further the causes of equality and racial justice.76
