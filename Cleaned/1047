Murcof is the performing and recording name of Mexican electronica artist Fernando Corona. Corona was born in 1970 in Tijuana, Mexico and raised in Ensenada. He was for a time a member of the Tijuana-based Nortec Collective of electronic musicians under the Terrestre project name. In 2000 he returned to Tijuana, but has since relocated to Barcelona, Spain.
Music
Murcof's music is sparse, minimalist, electronica. Although founded on abstract, glitchy, sometimes complex electronic percussion, Corona's recordings are more melodic and traditionally structured than many contemporary electronic musicians. Many recordings feature orchestral strings sampled from recordings of works by modern composers such as Arvo P&lt;U+00E4&gt;rt.
