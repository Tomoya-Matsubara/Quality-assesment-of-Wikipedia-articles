In December 2003, Port Vale F.C. went into debts of more than &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 million.25 Chaudry was one of five potential buyers for the club, but Bill Bratt&lt;U+2019&gt;s Valiant 2001 supporters group eventually took the club out of administration.26 Following Bratt&lt;U+2019&gt;s retirement from the post in 2011,27 Chaudry once again applied to become the director of Port Vale; with a proposed 51% majority share28 (an investment of approximately &lt;U+00A3&gt;5m) in the football club. His bid was backed by the majority of the shareholders, including former players, pop star Robbie Williams29 and darts legend Phil (&lt;U+2018&gt;The Power&lt;U+2019&gt;) Taylor. However, at a Port Vale EGM on 1 June 2011,30 less than the required 75% of the votes were received and, therefore, the constitution could not be changed to allow a takeover of the club.

He managed to make a profit in the first year32 and has continued to do so every year since. The WaterWorld complex now receives over 400,000 visitors annually33 and is regarded as the most profitable water-based visitor attraction in the U.K. In 2006, Mo unveiled plans for a &lt;U+00A3&gt;60m expansion of WaterWorld,34 aimed at increasing employment from 150 to 350; bringing a further &lt;U+00A3&gt;20 million into the region&lt;U+2019&gt;s economy35 and doubling visitor numbers.
