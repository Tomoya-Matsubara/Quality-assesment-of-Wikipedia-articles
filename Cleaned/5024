''For other uses, see Jurassic Park (disambiguation).
Jurassic Park is a 1993 science fiction film directed by Steven Spielberg and based on the novel of the same name by Michael Crichton. The film centers on the island of Isla Nublar, where scientists have created an amusement park of cloned dinosaurs. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a group of scientists, played by Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern, to visit the park. Sabotage sets the dinosaurs on the loose, and technicians and visitors attempt to escape the island.
Development of the film began before the novel was even published, and Crichton was hired to contribute to a script that cut much of its story. Spielberg hired Stan Winston Studios' puppets and worked with Industrial Light and Magic to develop cutting-edge CGI to portray the dinosaurs. Jurassic Park was well received by critics, although they criticized the characterization. During its release, the film grossed $914 million, becoming the most successful film yet released, and it is currently the eighth-highest grossing feature film. Most significantly, the film inspired a new breed of films that primarily used CGI for special effects. The film was followed by The Lost World: Jurassic Park in 1997 and by Jurassic Park III in 2001. A fourth film is currently in development.
Plot
Improve grammar, but don't extend it, plot is already complex On Isla Nublar, an InGen employee is killed while releasing a Velociraptor into a penhold, prompting a lawsuit from his family. CEO John Hammond is pressured by his investors to allow a safety investigation by experts before opening the park. He invites Drs. Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, as well as chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm and his investors' attorney Donald Gennaro, to perform the inspection. At the park, they learn that InGen recreated the dinosaurs by cloning genetic material found in mosquitoes that fed on dinosaur blood, preserved in Dominican amber. The DNA from these samples was spliced with DNA from frogs to fill in gaps: during this process, the dinosaurs are bred as females to control the population. The team are also shown the pen containing the ferocious and intelligent adults.
 Malcolm and Sattler are concerned, but Grant remains neutral. They meet Hammond's grandchildren, Alexis and Tim Murphy, and go on a vehicular tour of the park. Ellie leaves the tour to take care of a sick Triceratops. A storm hits the island and most InGen employees leave, except for Hammond, game warden Robert Muldoon, chief engineer Ray Arnold, and lead computer programmer Dennis Nedry. Commissioned by rival businessman Lewis Dodgson, Nedry takes an opportunity to shut down the park's security system so he can steal dinosaur embryos and deliver them to an auxiliary dock. Thus, a Tyrannosaurus breaks through the electric fence surrounding its pen, killing Gennaro, wounding Malcolm and then attacks Tim and Lex hiding in the car. The children and Grant only narrowly avoid being killed and eaten. Meanwhile, Ellie and Muldoon rescue Malcolm and are almost caught by the T. rex during an intense chase. Nedry crashes his car and after trying to fix it is killed by a Dilophosaurus. Grant, Tim, and Lex spend the night in a tree and while hiking to safety the next morning discover some of the dinosaurs are actually breeding. Grant realizes that the frog DNA is responsible, as some species of frog are known to spontaneously change gender in a single-sex environment.
 Arnold tries to hack Nedry&lt;U+2019&gt;s computer to turn the power back on and fails, so he leaves to turn it back on manually. Ellie and Muldoon follow after he fails to return and discover the raptors have escaped. Muldoon tells Ellie to go to the utility shed herself and turn the power back on while he hunts the raptors that have been stalking them. Muldoon is attacked and killed by a lurking raptor while Ellie escapes from another after discovering Arnold's remains. After managing to turn on the power and escaping the raptor, she meets up with Grant. They both go back to Malcolm and Hammond, and Grant grabs a shotgun after learning that two raptors have escaped their pen and a third has been contained. Lex and Tim narrowly escape two of the raptors in the kitchen and, using her computer skills, Lex reboots the mainframe in order to call Hammond to get a helicopter while Grant and Ellie hold off a raptor trying to open the door to the computer room. After a scuffle on top of the fossil exhibits where the raptors block their escape route, the Tyrannosaurus suddenly barges in and kills both raptors. Grant, Ellie, Lex and Tim climb into Hammond and Malcolm's jeep and leave. Grant says he will not endorse the park, a choice with which Hammond concurs. Flying away in the helicopter, the children fall asleep beside Grant, who contemplatively watches the birds flying nearby, the surviving relatives of the dinosaurs they escaped. 
Cast
Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant: A paleontologist excavating Velociraptor fossils in the Montanan Badlands. He dislikes children, frightening one with a talon of a raptor, but he soon has to protect Hammond's grandchildren. Neill was Spielberg's original choice, but was busy. Spielberg then met Richard Dreyfuss and Kurt Russell, who were too expensive, and William Hurt turned down the role.1 Spielberg then pushed back filming a month to let Neill play the character: he wound up only having a weekend's break between filming Family Pictures and Jurassic Park. Neill prepared for the role by meeting Jack Horner.2
Laura Dern as Dr. Ellie Sattler: A paleobotanist and Grant's girlfriend. Dern also met Horner and visited the Los Angeles Natural History Museum, learning to prepare a fossil.3
Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm: A mathematician and chaos theorist. He forewarns the danger of resurrecting dinosaurs and becomes Hammond's main opposition. He also falls for Sattler, another in a long line of romantic interests. Goldblum was Spielberg's first choice,4 and is a big fan of dinosaurs.5 To prepare for his role, Goldblum met with James Gleick and Ivar Ekeland to discuss Chaos Theory.6
Richard Attenborough as John Hammond: CEO of InGen and architect of Jurassic Park. Jurassic Park was Attenborough's first acting role since 1979's The Human Factor.7
Ariana Richards as Alexis &quot;Lex&quot; Murphy: Hammond's granddaughter, a vegetarian and self-professed computer hacker.
Joseph Mazzello as Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Murphy: Lex's younger brother, into dinosaurs. He has read Grant's numerous books.
Wayne Knight as Dennis Nedry: The disgruntled architect of Jurassic Park's computer systems. He is bribed by Biosyn agent Lewis Dodgson for $1.5 million to deliver frozen dinosaur embryos.
Samuel L. Jackson as Ray Arnold: The park's chief engineer. He switches off the main power to reboot the mainframe &lt;U+2014&gt; but unwittingly unleashes the raptors in doing so.
Bob Peck as Robert Muldoon: The park's game warden. He is concerned by the intelligence of the raptors, and would have them all destroyed.
Martin Ferrero as Donald Gennaro: A lawyer who represents Hammond's concerned investors.
B. D. Wong as Dr. Henry Wu: The park's chief geneticist, who is responsible for making all the dinosaurs female and lysine deficient. He leaves during the storm.
Gerald R. Molen, the film's producer, cameoed as Gerry Harding: The park's veterinarian, who only appears to take care of the Triceratops.
Cameron Thor as Lewis Dodgson: The head of InGen's rival corporation Biosyn in the novel. He only appears in the film to give Nedry a shaving cream can to put stolen embryos in before he goes to Jurassic Park.
Dean Cundey, the film's cinematographer, cameoed as the Dockworker who Nedry talks to on the computer.
Richard Kiley as himself, supplying the voice of the car tour guide.
Production
Michael Crichton originally conceived a screenplay about a boy who recreates a dinosaur; he continued to wrestle with his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel Jurassic Park.8 Spielberg learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the TV series E.R.9 Before the book was published, Crichton put up a non-negotiable fee for $1.5 million as well as a substantial percentage of the gross. Warner Bros. and Tim Burton, Columbia Tristar and Richard Donner, and 20th Century Fox and Joe Dante bid for the rights,10 but Universal eventually acquired them in May 1990 for Spielberg.11
Universal further paid Crichton $500,000 to adapt his own novel,12 which he finished by the time Spielberg was filming Hook. Crichton noted that, because the book was &quot;fairly long&quot;, his script only had about 10&lt;U+2013&gt;20 percent of the content; scenes were dropped for budgetary and practical reasons.13 Concurrently, Spielberg hired Stan Winston to create the animatronic dinosaurs, Phil Tippett to create go motion dinosaurs for longshots, and Michael Lantieri and Dennis Muren to supervise the on-set effects and digital compositing respectively. Paleontologist Jack Horner supervised the designs, to help commit to Spielberg's desire of portraying the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. Horner dismissed the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics,14 complaining, &quot;[The dinosaurs] have no way of doing that!&quot; Based on Horner's complaint, Spielberg insisted that Tippett take the tongues out.15  After completing Hook, Spielberg wanted to film Schindler's List. MCA president Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on one condition: that Spielberg make Jurassic Park first. Spielberg later said, &quot;He knew that once I had directed Schindler I wouldn't be able to do Jurassic Park&quot;.16 Beginning October 1991, Malia Scotch Marmo rewrote the script from scratch over a five month period, merging Ian Malcolm with Alan Grant.17 Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs, before molding latex skins, which were folded over onto complex robotics.18 Tippett created stop-motion animatics of major scenes, but, despite go-motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a live-action feature film.19 Animators Mark Dippe and Steve Williams went ahead in creating a computer generated walk cycle for the T. rex skeleton and were approved to do more.20 When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the T. rex chasing a herd of Gallimimus, Spielberg said, &quot;You're out of a job,&quot; to which Tippett replied, &quot;Don't you mean extinct?&quot;21 Spielberg later wrote both the animatic and his dialogue between him and Tippett into the script.22
Screenwriter David Koepp came on board afterward, starting afresh from Marmo's draft, and used Spielberg's idea of a cartoon shown to the visitors to remove much of the exposition that fills Crichton's novel.23 Spielberg also excised a sub-plot of Procompsognathus escaping to the mainland and attacking young children, as he found it too horrific.24 In terms of characterization, Hammond was changed from a ruthless businessman to a kindly old man, as Spielberg admitted he identified with Hammond's obsession with showmanship.25 He also switched the characters of Tim and Lex; in the book, Tim is aged 11 and into computers, and Lex is only seven or eight and into sports. Spielberg did this because he wanted to work with Joseph Mazello, and it also allowed him to introduce the subplot of Lex's adolescent crush on Grant.26 Koepp changed Grant's relationship with the children, making him hostile to them initially to allow for more character development.27 Koepp also took the opportunity to cut out a major sequence from the book where the T. rex chases Grant and the children down a river before being tranquilized by Muldoon for budget reasons.28 After two years and one month of pre-production, filming began on August 24, 1992 on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.29 The three week shoot involved various daytime exteriors.30 On September 11, Hurricane Iniki passed directly over Kauai, which caused the crew to lose a day of shooting.31 The scheduled shoot of the Gallimimus chase was moved to Oahu.32
The crew moved back to the mainland U.S.A., to shoot at Universal Studios's Stage 24, for scenes involving the raptors in the kitchen.33 The crew also shot on Stage 23 for the scenes involving the power supply before going on location to Red Rock Canyon for the Montana dig scenes.34 The crew returned to Universal to shoot Grant's rescue of Tim, using a fifty-foot prop with hydraulic wheels for the car fall, and the Brachiosaurus encounter. The crew proceeded to film scenes for the Park's labs and control room, which used animations for the computers loaned from Silicon Graphics and Apple Inc.35 This can be seen in the film as Nedry talks to the dockworker, a supposedly live conversation which is clearly a video file due to the visible playback bar.36 The crew moved to Warner Bros. Studios' Stage 16 to shoot the T. rex attack on the tour cars.37 Shooting proved frustrating due to water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur.38 Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the Dilophosaurus on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center.39 Spielberg brought back the T. rex for the climax, nixing his original ending of Grant using a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws.40 The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30,414243 and within days Michael Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming Schindler's List.44
Special effects work continued on the film, with Tippett's unit adjusting to new technology with Dinosaur Input Devices: models which fed information into the computers to allow themselves to animate the characters traditionally. In addition, they acted out scenes with the raptors and Gallimimus. As well as the computer generated dinosaurs, ILM also created elements such as water splashing and digital face replacement for Ariana Richard's stunt double.45 Spielberg monitored their progress from Poland.46 Composer John Williams began work on the score at the end of February, and it was conducted a month later by John Neufeld and Alexander Courage.47 The sound effects crew, supervised by George Lucas,48 were finished by the end of April. Jurassic Park was finally completed on May 28 1993.49
Dinosaurs on screen
Despite the title of the film most of the dinosaurs featured did not exist until the Cretaceous period.50 
Tyrannosaurus, informally dubbed &quot;T. Rex&quot;, is the star of the film according to Spielberg, being the reason he rewrote the ending for fear of disappointing the audience.51 Winston's rex animatronic stood 20 feet, weighed 13,000 pounds,52 and was 40 feet long.53 Jack Horner called it &quot;the closest I've ever been to a live dinosaur&quot;.54 The dinosaur is depicted with a vision based on movement. The rex's roar is a baby elephant mixed with a tiger and an alligator and its breath is a whale's blowhole.55 A dog attacking a ball was used for the sounds of it tearing a Gallimimus apart.56
Velociraptor, dubbed 'raptors' in the film, also have a major role, although those depicted are not based on the actual species in question, which is significantly smaller. It was instead based on its larger relative, Deinonychus, which was at the time called Velociraptor antirrhopus by some scientists.57 Crichton followed this theory, but by the time production of the film took place, the idea had been dropped. When the similar Utahraptor was discovered before the film's release, Stan Winston joked, &quot;We made it, then they discovered it.&quot;58 For the attack on Robert Muldoon, the raptors were played by men in suits.59 Dolphin screams, walrus bellowing, geese hissing, an African crane's mating call and human rasps were mixed to form various raptor sounds.6061 Lastly, after the film's release, most paleontologists have concluded that dromaeosaurs like Velociraptor and Deinonychus had feathers,62 though no direct fossil evidence of integument of any kind exists for Velociraptor itself.
Dilophosaurus was also very different from its real life counterpart, made significantly smaller to make sure audiences did not confuse it with the raptors.63 Its frill and ability to spit venom are also fictional. Its vocal sounds were made by combining a swan, a hawk, and a rattlesnake together.64
Brachiosaurus is inaccurately depicted as chewing its food. Despite scientific evidence of them having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder.65
Triceratops has an extended cameo. Its appearance was a particular logistical nightmare for Stan Winston when Spielberg requested to shoot the animatronic of the sick creature earlier than expected.66 Winston also created a baby Triceratops for Ariana Richards to ride, which was cut from the film for pacing reasons.67
Gallimimus' and Parasaurolophus' roles are mainly cameos, the latter appearing in the first encounter with the Brachiosaurus.
Release
Universal spent $65 million on the marketing campaign for Jurassic Park, making deals with 100 companies to market 1000 products.68 These included three Jurassic Park video games by SEGA and Ocean Software,69 a toy line by Kenner that was distributed by Hasbro,70 and a novelization aimed at young children.71 The released soundtrack included unused material.72 Trailers for the film only gave fleeting glimpses of the dinosaurs,73 a tactic journalist Josh Horowitz described as &quot;that old Spielberg axiom of never revealing too much&quot; when Spielberg and director Michael Bay did the same for their production of Transformers in 2007.74 The film was marketed with the tagline An adventure 65 million years in the making, which was an on-set joke of Spielberg's regarding the genuine mosquito in amber used for Hammond's walking stick.75
The film had its premiere at the National Building Museum on June 9 1993 in Washington D.C.,76 in support of two children's charities.77 Following the film's release, a travelling exhibition began.78 Steve Englehart wrote a series of comic books published by Topps Comics. They acted as a continuation of the film, consisting of the two issue Raptor, and Raptors Attack, Raptors Hijack and Return to Jurassic Park, which were four issues each. Return to Jurassic Park was to continue for another four issues but was cancelled. All published issues were republished under the single title Jurassic Park Adventures in the U.S.A., and as Jurassic Park in the U.K.79 Ocean Software released a game sequel entitled Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues in 1994 on Game Boy.80
The Jurassic Park Ride began development in November 199081 and premiered at Universal Studios Hollywood on June 15 199682 to the cost of $110 million.83 Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida has an entire section of the park dedicated to Jurassic Park which includes the main ride, here christened Jurassic Park River Adventure, which opened in March 1999, and many smaller rides and attractions based on the Jurassic Park series.84 At 85 feet, the drop at the Orlando ride is the deepest ever built.85 The Universal Studios theme park rides have been designed to support the film's plot, with Hammond having been contacted to rebuild the Park at the theme park location.86
The film made its VHS debut on October 4 1994,87 and was first released on DVD on October 10 2000.88 The film was also released in a package with The Lost World: Jurassic Park.89 The DVD has also been re-released with both sequels on December 11 2001.90 and as the Jurassic Park Adventure Pack on November 29 2005.91
Reaction
The film received modestly positive reviews. High praise was heaped on the visual effects, although there was a lot of criticism levelled at the characterization and departures from the book. Janet Maslin in The New York Times called it, &quot;A true movie milestone, presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the screen....On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents...[but] [i]t becomes less crisp on screen than it was on the page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away.&quot;92 In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as &quot;colossal entertainment - the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year....Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen.&quot;93 Roger Ebert noted, &quot;The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. We see them early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values.&quot;94 Henry Sheehan argued, &quot;The complaints over Jurassic Park's lack of story and character sound a little off the point,&quot; pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them.95
The film went on to become the most financially successful film yet released, beating E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial which previously held the title, although it did not top E.T. domestically.96 The film opened with $47 million in its first weekend,97 and it grossed $81.7 million by its first week.98 The film stayed at number one for three weeks and eventually grossed $357 million domestically.99 The film also did very well in foreign markets, breaking opening records in the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Mexico and Taiwan.100 Spielberg earned over $250 million from the film.101 Jurassic Park's worldwide gross was topped five years later by James Cameron's Titanic.102
The movie won all three Academy Awards it was nominated for: Visual Effects, Sound Effects Editing, and Sound. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation103 and the Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing for Crichton and Koepp and Best Special Effects.104 The film won the People's Choice Awards for Favorite All-Around Motion Picture.105 Young Artist Awards were given to Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, with the film winning an Outstanding Action/Adventure Family Motion Picture award.106 The film won honours outside of the U.S., such as the BAFTA for Best Special Effects, as well as the Award for the Public's Favourite Film,107 and Awards for Best Foreign Language Film from the Japanese Academy, Mainichi Eiga Concours and Blue Ribbon, and the Czech Lions.108  Jurassic Park is ranked as fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with an 87% positive rating, with 26 out of 30 critics giving it positive reviews.109 The American Film Institute named Jurassic Park the 35th most thrilling film of all time on June 13 2001,110 and Bravo chose a scene from it as the 95th scariest scene of all time in 2005.111 In 2004, on their fifteenth anniversary, Empire called it the sixth most influential film of their lifetime.112 Upon their fifty-fifth anniversary in 2005, Film Review declared it one of the five most important films of their lifetime.113 In 2006, IGN ranked Jurassic Park as the 19th greatest film franchise of all time.114
Most significantly, when many filmmakers saw Jurassic Park's use of computer generated imagery, they realized that many of their visions, previously thought unfeasible or too expensive, were now possible. Stanley Kubrick contacted Spielberg to direct A.I.,115 George Lucas started to make the Star Wars prequels,116 and Peter Jackson began to re-explore his childhood love of fantasy films, a path that led him onto The Lord of the Rings and King Kong.117 Jurassic Park has inspired films and documentaries such as Godzilla, Carnosaur and Walking with Dinosaurs,118 as well as numerous parodies. Stan Winston joined together with IBM and director James Cameron to form Digital Domain, saying, &quot;If I didn't get involved, I was going to become the dinosaur.&quot;119 Alex Billington declared it as a film that was ahead of its time, saying that on another level, &quot;Even using the animatronics system that they did, this was a far step ahead of anything at the time. Then the stories surrounding how horrifically real the dinosaurs were fueled its popularity even more. And the best part is that they look better in this movie than any more recent CGI creations.&quot;120
