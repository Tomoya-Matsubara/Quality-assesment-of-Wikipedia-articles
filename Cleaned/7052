Award description
The Prisoner of War Medal 1940&lt;U+2013&gt;1945 was a 38 mm in diameter circular bronze medal surmounted by a three dimensional 25 mm high royal crown mounted on a pin giving the entire assembly (medal and crown) a height of 64 mm. The obverse bore a broadsword pointing down superimposed over a Greek cross with slightly flared ends and bisecting the years &quot;1940&quot; and &quot;1945&quot; inscribed in relief on the lateral cross arms. Two triangular laurel leaves protrude from between the cross arms fanning out. A ring of barbed wire encircles the cross along the entire circumference 3mm from the medal's edge. The reverse bore a guard tower and prison camp fence surrounded by a chain along the entire circumference 3mm from the medal's edge.2
The medal was suspended by a ring through the crown's orb from a 37 mm wide black silk moir&lt;U+00E9&gt; ribbon with narrow longitudinal 1 mm red/black/yellow/black/red stripes 2 mm from the edges. Years of imprisonment were denoted on the ribbon by small striated metal bars.3
