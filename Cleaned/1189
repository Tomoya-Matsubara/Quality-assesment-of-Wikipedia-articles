Life
Wainwright was born in Huddersfield in 1963 and brought up in Sowerby Bridge where she attended Sowerby Bridge High School.2 Unlike the rest of her family she disliked reading but went to York University to take English literature. She believes that she may be dyslexic as she has difficulty in reading a complete novel and prefers to just read the interesting bits.3
After university she unsuccessfully took a play to the Edinburgh Festival but she did find an agent for her writing. Meanwhile she worked as a bus driver. She left the driving job after about 18 months when she was given her first writing debut writing for the Radio 4 series The Archers. One of her contributions was to write an untypical story for the long running radio soap where the village shop was held up. After that she wrote for Coronation Street where she feels she developed her story writing skills from 1994 to 1999. She was adopted by Kay Mellor, the writer of the TV series Band of Gold, who encouraged her to leave the safe job on the soap and write. She created at At Home with the Braithwaites which was a story about a woman who had secretly won the lottery. This TV series wwas nominated for many awards.4 Wainwright says that her strong female flawed characters are almost real to her and they arrive fully formed in her imagination. She likes to control the television that is created and has done some directing and production of her own work5 ensuring that the scenery and dialogue reflects Yorkshire.6
Wainwright based the plot of her series Last Tango in Halifax on her mother's story. Wainwright's father had died in 2001 after an unsuccessful marriage.7 Her mother, Dorothy, moved to Oxfordshire to live with her daughter and she rediscovered a lost love, Alec Walker, via Friends Reunited. With her mother's permission Wainwright developed the story of how she remarried so rapidly and she showed her mother the series before it was broadcast.8
