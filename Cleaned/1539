The 2010 UEFA Europa League Final will be the final match of the 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10 UEFA Europa League, the first season of the revamped European football competition formerly known as the UEFA Cup. The match is scheduled to be played at the HSH Nordbank Arena, home ground of Hamburger SV, in Hamburg, Germany on 12 May 2010.1 Due to UEFA rules against corporate sponsorship outside the federation, the stadium will be referred to as &quot;Hamburg Arena&quot; for the final.
The winners will play in the 2010 UEFA Super Cup in Monaco in August 2010, where they will play against the winners of the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final. They will also receive automatic qualification for the 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 UEFA Europa League (unless they qualify for the 2010&lt;U+2013&gt;11 UEFA Champions League via their domestic league).
Background
No European final has ever been played in the city of Hamburg, although six European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals have been played in German cities, as well as one UEFA Cup final since it became a single-legged match.
The HSH Nordbank Arena was opened in 2000 on the site of Hamburg's previous stadia: the Bahrenfelder Stadium and the Volksparkstadion (). The Bahrenfelder Stadium was built in 1925, but after a two-year renovation, it was replaced by the 75,000-capacity Volksparkstadion in 1953. Hamburger SV moved into the Volksparkstadion from their previous home at Rothenbaum in 1963. The stadium then played host to three Group 1 matches at the 1974 FIFA World Cup in West Germany. 14 years later, UEFA Euro 1988 was held in West Germany and the Volksparkstadion was chosen to host the semi-final between West Germany and the Netherlands. By the late 1990s, plans were laid down for a complete renovation of the stadium; the playing surface was rotated by 90 degrees to take advantage of the natural angle of sunlight and the stadium was rebuilt to hold more than 57,000 spectators. Building work began in 1998 and Hamburger SV returned to the ground in 2000. The stadium was used as a venue for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, playing host to four group stage matches and the quarter-final between Italy and Ukraine.23
Pre-match
Venue
The HSH Nordbank Arena was chosen as the venue for the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final at a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Vaduz, Liechtenstein, on 28 March 2008. The committee &lt;U+2013&gt; who selected the venue for the 2010 UEFA Champions League Final at the same meeting &lt;U+2013&gt; based their decision on a number of key criteria, including stadium capacity, facilities and security.4
Like the recent finals of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup, the 2010 Europa League final was given its own unique visual identity. The design concept is intended to give the public a distinctive impression of the host city and will be used on all media associated with the event. The logo for the 2010 final was revealed at the EAST Hotel Cinema in Hamburg on 30 November 2009 &lt;U+2013&gt; to coincide with the opening of ticket sales for German residents on 1 December &lt;U+2013&gt; and the ceremony was attended by the regional officer for sport and culture, Karin von Welck, German Football Association general secretary Wolfgang Niersbach, Hamburger SV chairman Bernd Hoffmann and Germany Under-19 coach Horst Hrubesch. The logo features an artistic impression of two footballers competing for a ball, set against a modern drawing of various elements of the Hamburg skyline.5
Ticketing
The regular capacity of the HSH Nordbank Arena is just over 57,000; however, for the 2010 Europa League final and other international matches, the standing area in the north stand is converted to seating, reducing the capacity to around 51,500. Approximately 25% of the available tickets will be allocated to each club for distribution to their own fans,6 while approximately 5,100 tickets were retained for the international general public. Following the ticket application process for German residents &lt;U+2013&gt; which ran from 1 December 2009 to 15 January 201078 &lt;U+2013&gt; applications were opened to the international general public on 24 February 2010 and closed on 19 March. If demand exceeds the number of tickets available, successful applications will be determined by a ballot before 30 March.910
