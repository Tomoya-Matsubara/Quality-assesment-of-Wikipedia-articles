PlayStation 3 owners can purchase a wealth of accessories that are designed for or are compatible with the Playstation 3 system. These accessories include game controllers, audio and video input devices like microphones and video cameras, and cables for improved sound and picture quality.
Sixaxis
 The Sixaxis Wireless Controller (trademarked &quot;SIXAXIS&quot;) was the official wireless controller for the Sony PlayStation 3, later to be succeeded by the DualShock 3. In Japan, individual Sixaxis controllers were available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch, without a USB to USB mini cable. The word &quot;Sixaxis&quot; (contraction of &quot;six axis&quot; for the directional movements) is a palindrome.
History
At E3 2005, Sony showcased their &quot;boomerang&quot; design for the PlayStation 3's controller. Accompanied by much criticism, most of which were for its looks, this design was later abandoned. Sony later stated that the original controller &quot;was very clearly designed as a design concept, and was never intended to be the final controller, despite what everybody said about it.&quot;1
The boomerang design was replaced by an altered, wireless version of the DualShock 2 controller at E3 2006
The Sixaxis controller is currently being phased out, and the DualShock 3 is the new official controller, which in addition to a vibration feature will still include Sixaxis functionality. However Europe will still have the Sixaxis controller during summer as the European Metal Gear Solid 4 PlayStation 3 bundle includes a Sixaxis. 2 The Sixaxis is no longer being produced.
Feature and design changes
The Sixaxis can operate for up to 30 hours on a full charge. The battery was originally not thought to be replaceable when a Sony spokesperson stated that the Sixaxis should operate for &quot;many years before there's any degradation in terms of battery performance. When and if this happens, then of course Sony will be providing a service to exchange these items&quot;.3 Later, it was revealed that the Sixaxis came with instructions on how to remove the battery and that the battery was fully removable.4
A major feature of the controller is the ability to sense both rotational orientation and translational acceleration along all three dimensional axes, providing six degrees of freedom.5 This became a matter of controversy, as the circumstances of the announcement, made less than eight months after Nintendo revealed motion-sensing capabilities in its new game console controller (see Wii Remote), led to speculation that the addition of motion-sensing was a late-stage decision by Sony to follow Nintendo's move. Further fueling the speculation was the fact that only one game shown at E3 that year demonstrated the motion-sensing feature.  Also, some comments from Incognito Entertainment, the developer behind the motion-sensing PlayStation 3 game, Warhawk, said that it received development controllers with the motion-sensing feature only 10 days or so before E3.6 Developer Brian Upton from SCE Studios Santa Monica later clarified that the Incognito had been secretly working on the motion-sensing technology &quot;for a while&quot;, but did not receive a working controller until &quot;the last few weeks before E3&quot;.7
The Sixaxis features finer analog sensitivity than the DualShock 2, increased to 10-bit precision from the 8-bit precision of the DualShock 2.8 The frame around the L2 and R2 buttons has been omitted, resulting in more trigger-like buttons, with an increased range of depression. In the place of the &quot;Analog&quot; mode button switch of previous dual analog models is a jewel-like &quot;PS button&quot; with the PlayStation logo, which can be used to access the home menu, switch controller inputs and turn the console or the controller on or off.
Some Sixaxis are made from translucent plastic, which, when held against light, reveals the inner components of the controller.
LED lights
 A row of four numbered LED port indicators are on the top of the controller, to identify and distinguish multiple wireless controllers. Due to there being only four player LEDs on the controller itself, multiple indicators light up for players 5, 6 and 7 (for example, if the '4' and '1' indicators are illuminated at the same time, the controller is assigned to Player 5). While the PS3 is turned on, pressing the PS button will bring up a menu displaying the battery charge of all synced controllers among other options.
Partial list of games that support 5-7 players offline
The following games support 7 players offline on a single screen unless otherwise noted. In addition to Sony-made controllers, most any USB controller will work due to the PS3's plug-and-play capabilities. Due to the Xbox 360 controller requiring driver support, it will not function, but most PC controllers will, in addition to PS2 controllers connected via a PS2-to-USB adapter.

Removal of vibration capability
Sony announced that because of the included motion sensors, the vibration feature of previous PlayStation controllers was removed, stating that the vibration would interfere with motion-sensing.9 This therefore made the PS3 wireless controller incredibly light, which felt strange to players accustomed to heavier controllers such as the DualShock. Haptics developer Immersion Corporation, which had successfully sued Sony for patent infringement,10 expressed skepticism of Sony's rationale, with company president Victor Viegas stating in an interview, &quot;I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t believe it&lt;U+2019&gt;s a very difficult problem to solve, and Immersion has experts that would be happy to solve that problem for them,&quot; under the condition that Sony withdraw its appeal of the patent infringement ruling.11 Immersion later emphasized compatibility with motion-sensing when introducing its next-generation vibration feedback technology, TouchSense.12 Subsequent statements from Sony were dismissive of the arguments from Immersion, with Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA) Senior VP of Marketing Peter Dille stating, &quot;It seems like the folks at Immersion are looking to sort of negotiate through the press and try to make their case to usÂ &lt;U+2026&gt; we've talked about how there's a potential for that rumble to interfere with the Sixaxis controller.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter_Dille&gt;Engadget.com
However, in a press release made some eight months later, Phil Harrison, Sony's president of worldwide studios, said: &quot;Now, rumble I think was the last generation feature; it's not the next-generation feature. I think motion sensitivity is.&quot; He added that rumbling would, in the future, only come from third-party controllers. 13. That statement was proven false less than a year later, with the announcement of the DualShock 3.

The DualShock 3 will be the official PlayStation 3 controller, replacing the SIXAXIS completely (while keeping the functionality of SIXAXIS). At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced the DualShock 3 (trademarked &quot;DUALSHOCK 3&quot;), a PlayStation 3 controller with the same function and design as the Sixaxis, but with vibration capability.14.
On November 11 2007, the official DualShock 3 controller was released in Japan, in Piano Black and Ceramic White, as well as Satin Silver (to match the Japanese color variations of the 40GB PS3 model). Software patches to provide a vibration function in previously-released PS3 software were made available.

PlayStation Eye
The PlayStation Eye is an updated version of the EyeToy USB webcam designed for the PlayStation 3. It will not work with PS2 EyeToy games, but the PS3 does support the PlayStation 2 EyeToy, using its camera and microphone functionalities. A firmware update enabled the PlayStation 3 to support all USB webcams which used the USB Video Class {{-}}
PlayTV
Officially announced August 22, 2007; PlayTV is a twin-channel DVB-T tuner peripheral with digital video recorder (DVR) software which allows users to record television programs to the PlayStation 3 hard drive for later viewing. Programs can be recorded while playing a game. The device was launched in the UK on the 19 September 2008 with other regions in Europe to follow. [5]
It has been reported that Australia will receive the Play TV accessory only 2 months after Europe. Currently earmarked for Q4 2008 [6]
Because North American markets, including the United States, Canada, and Mexico will be using the ATSC digital standard (and the latter two are currently early in their digital transition), it is unlikely they will see the PlayTV device because of compatibility issues.
Headsets
  Most commercial USB headsets are compatible with the PlayStation 3. In addition, the PlayStation 3 supports some PlayStation 2 USB accessories, including the USB SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs headset by Logitech, the SingStar microphones and the built-in microphone on the Eyetoy for video and voice chat (although the EyeToy Play game associated with the EyeToy is not available for use on European PlayStation 3s ). Since the PlayStation 3 supports Bluetooth technology, any type of wireless headset is compatible with the system15; however, Bluetooth wireless headsets are not compatible with PlayStation 2 games which use the USB headsets (due to being programmed for them only) and therefore the USB headsets must still be used (though this could potentially be solved with future firmware updates). On Sept. 12, 2007, Logitech announced16 new, Cordless Vantage Headset for Playstation 3. The Blu-ray Disc retail version of Warhawk comes bundled with a Jabra BT125 Bluetooth headset in North America and the Jabra BT135 in Europe.17
On June 27, 2008, it was announced that the headset that will be paired with the Blu-ray Disc version of SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Confrontation will be the official Bluetooth headset for the PlayStation 3 18 (see image). It will boast exclusive features such as a mute button, and will come with a charging cradle so that it may charge while connected to one of the system's USB ports 19, which is being marketed as being useful for storing when not in use.
The official headset allows for high quality voice-chat, and provides volume level, battery level, charging status and connection status indicators on the PS3's on-screen display. The headset can be used as a microphone when docked in the charging cradle - voice output from PS3 is automatically transferred to the TV in this case.
BD Remote
The PlayStation 3 BD Remote (CECHZR1) allows users to control videos and music on Blu-ray Disc and DVD through Bluetooth. In Japan, the device was available as of December 7, 2006. The device was available in North America as of December1. It uses 2 1.5 volt AA batteries. Since the remote communicates with the console using Bluetooth, which utilizes radio waves, the device does not need to be pointed at the console to function; as is the case with traditional infrared remotes. However, this fact means that an adapter is needed to use a &quot;universal&quot; infra-red remote control on the PS3. {{-}}
Memory Card Adaptor
The PlayStation 3 Memory Card Adaptor (CECHZM1) is a device that allows data to be transferred from a PlayStation memory card or a PlayStation 2 memory card to the PlayStation 3's hard disk. At launch, the device did not support transferring saved game files back to a memory card, but the upon release of the PlayStation 3 system software version 1.80, the user is now able to save and/or transfer PSOne and PS2 game saves from the PS3 directly onto a physical Memory Card via the adaptor. PlayStation 2 saved game files can also be transferred between PlayStation 3 users via other current memory card formats. The device connects to the PlayStation 3's USB port on one end through a USB Mini-B cable (not included with adaptor, but it was included with the console itself), and features a legacy PlayStation 2 memory card port on the other end. The adaptor was available for purchase simultaneously with the console's launch. The Memory Card Adaptor was released on 25 May 2007 in the UK. {{-}}
AC adapter charging kit
AC adapter Charging Kit can charge Sixaxis and/or DualShock 3 controller, official Bluetooth headset and the soon to be released Wireless Keypad. The kit can also charge the PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. AC Charger uses a wall power plug so you don't need to have a PS3 running to charge the hardware.
Wireless Keypad
 A wireless keypad peripheral 20 was launched in Europe on November 28, 2008.21 It will be launched in North America in early December 2008, and some time late 2008 in Japan. The keypad can be connected to a PlayStation 3 via Bluetooth, or connected to a controller.
The keypad features two shortcut buttons, a Communication Button and a Message Box Button, letting users jump to pre-set features on the XMB such as the Friends screen and Message Box during game play. The Touch Pad Button allows PS3 users to use the surface of the keypad as a touch pad, allowing them to move the pointer whilst web browsing by sliding their fingers around the keypad surface. The Bluetooth-enabled device will support and all typing on the PlayStation 3, including text chatting in Home and LittleBigPlanet support.
AV cables
  Both official HDMI cables and standard HDMI cables (ver 1.2 / 1.3) are also compatible. An official component AV cable set is also available. Also, composite, S-Video, RGB SCART and component cables for the PlayStation 2 are all compatible with the PlayStation 3, as they utilize the same &quot;A/V Multi Out&quot; port.22
On the audio part, AV cables connected to the &quot;AV Multi out&quot; allows 2.0ch (stereo) only, optical &quot;Digital out&quot; allows both 2.0ch and 5.1ch and &quot;HDMI out&quot; (Ver.1.3) supports 2.0ch, 5.1ch and 7.1ch.
Units sold in NTSC regions are SD/ED NTSC, 720p, 1080i and 1080p compliant, while those available in PAL regions are compatible with SD/ED PAL, 720p, 1080i and 1080p. A NTSC system (480i/480p) cannot output PAL (576i/576p) games and DVDs (DVD-Video/DVD-Audio) - however PAL units can display &quot;All Region&quot; NTSC DVDs. This regional lock does not affect HD output (720p/1080i/1080p) - except for Blu-ray Disc movies.
