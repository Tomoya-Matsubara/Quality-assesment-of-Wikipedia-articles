The Mongolian language (, Mong&lt;U+03B3&gt;ol kele; Cyrillic: &lt;U+041C&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0433&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt; &lt;U+0445&gt;&lt;U+044D&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;, Mongol khel) is the best-known member of the Mongolic language family. It is the language of most residents of Mongolia and of many of the Mongolian residents of the Inner Mongolia autonomous region of China, totalling about 5.7 million speakers. In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect of Mongolian, written in Cyrillic, is predominant; in Inner Mongolia, the language is more dialectically diverse and written in the traditional Mongolian script.
Mongolian has vowel harmony and a complex syllabic structure for a Mongolic language that allows up to three syllable-final consonants. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While the basic word order is subject&lt;U+2013&gt;object&lt;U+2013&gt;predicate, the noun phrase order is relatively free, so functional roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. Verbs can take several voice suffixes and are marked for aspect and some other notions belonging to the domains of tense, modality and evidentiality. In sentence linking, converbs play a special part.
Mongolian evolved from Middle Mongolian, the language spoken in the Mongol Empire of the 13th and 14th centuries. In the transition, a major shift in the vowel harmony paradigm occurred, long vowels developed, the case system was slightly reformed and the verbal system was restructured.
Classification
 Mongolian is a Mongolic language. Other languages in the Mongolic family include Khamnigan and Dagur, spoken in Eastern Greater Mongolia and in the vinicity of Tacheng in Xinjiang; Shira Yugur, Bonan, Dongxiang, Monguor, and Kangjia, spoken in China's Qinghai and Gansu regions; and the probably extinct Moghol of Afghanistan. Oirat (including the Kalmyk dialect) and Buryat &lt;U+2013&gt; both spoken in Russia, Mongolia and China &lt;U+2013&gt; are considered by some scholars to be major dialects of Mongolian, and by others as Mongolic languages in their own right. Ordos, spoken around Inner Mongolia's Ordos City, is regarded by most scholars as a dialect of Mongolian; a few consider it an independent language.1 The Altaic theory proposes that the Mongolic family is a member of a larger Altaic family that would also include the Turkic, Tungusic and Japonic languages and Korean.
Geographic distribution and dialects
Mongolian is the national language of the state of Mongolia, where it is spoken by about 2.5 million people, and an official language of China's Inner Mongolia region, where it is spoken by 2.7 million or more people.2 The exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is hard to determine, as there is no data available on Chinese citizens' language proficiency. There are roughly 5 million people of Mongolian nationality in China, but the use of Mongolian is declining, especially among younger speakers in urban areas due to the dominance of Mandarin Chinese.3 The great majority of speakers of Mongolian proper in China live in Inner Mongolia, but there are also some speakers of the Kharchin and Khorchin dialects in areas of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang that border Inner Mongolia.4
The delimitation of the Mongolian language is a much-disputed problem, whose resolution would probably require a set of comparable linguistic criteria for all major varieties. Such data might account for the historical development of the Mongolian dialect continuum, as well as its sociolinguistic qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed,5 the basis for a comparative morpho-syntactic study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as Khalkha and Khorchin,6 is not yet established.7
 There is no disagreement that the Khalkha dialect of the Mongolian state is Mongolian.8 After fixing this one point, however, classification problems arise. For example, the influential classification of San&lt;U+017E&gt;eev (1953) proposed that Buryat and Oirat are independent Mongolic languages, but that such dialects as Chakhar and Ordos belong to a &quot;Mongolian language&quot;.9 On the other hand, Luvsanvandan (1959) proposed a &quot;Mongolian language&quot; consisting of a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, Kalmyk) and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties).10 Some Western scholars propose that the relatively well researched Ordos variety is an independent language due to its conservative syllable and phoneme structure.11 While the placement of a variety like Alasha, which is under the cultural influence of Inner Mongolia but historically tied to Oirat,12 and of other border varieties like Darkhad must remain problematic in any classification,13 the question of how to classify Chakhar, Khalkha and Khorchin in relation to each other and in relation to Buryat and Oirat remains the central problem.14 The split of  into  before *i and  before all other reconstructed vowels, which is found in Mongolia but not in Inner Mongolia, is often cited as a fundamental distinction,15 for example Proto-Mongolic *il, Khalkha , Chakhar il] 'year' versus Proto-Mongolic *, Khalkha , Chakhar  'few'.16 On the other hand, the split between the past tense verbal suffixes - in the Central varieties vs. - in the Eastern varieties17 is usually seen as a merely stochastic difference.18
In Inner Mongolia, official language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: South Mongolian, Oirat and Barghu-Buryat. &quot;Inner Mongolian&quot; is said to consist of Chakhar, Ordos, Baarin, Khorchin, Kharchin and Alasha; it is assumed that they jointly provide a standard grammar despite their internal grammatical differences. The authorities have established a standard pronunciation based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the Plain Blue Banner.19 While the varieties of &quot;Inner Mongolian&quot; share a literary standard distinct from that of the &quot;Outer Mongolian&quot; Khalkha, a dialectological approach would see a sharper distinction between, for example, the &quot;Inner Mongolian&quot; varieties of Chakhar and Khorchin than between Chakhar and Khalkha.20
Phonology
The following description, based on Khalkha as spoken in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia's capital, differs considerably from the phoneme systems of varieties such as Chakhar, Ordos, Khorchin and Kharchin.21
Vowels
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! ! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Front ! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Central ! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Back |- ! ! Short ! Long ! Short ! Long ! Short !

Short /o/ is phonetically central . Mongolian also has four diphthongs: .22
Vowel length. Pronunciation of long and short vowels depends on the syllable's position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a phonemic contrast in length. Here, a long vowel has about 208% the length of a short vowel. In word-internal and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels have been reduced to 127% the length of short word-initial vowels, thus becoming short phonemes, but still being separate from word-initial short vowels as &quot;full vowels&quot;. Short non-initial vowels have been reduced to 71% the length of short word-initial vowels and become centralized, in the course losing their status as phonemes and becoming non-phonemic.23
Backness harmony. Mongolian divides vowels into two groups in a system of vowel harmony:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! +ATR (&quot;front&quot;) ! -ATR (&quot;back&quot;) ! Neutral |- |  |  |  |}
For historical reasons, these have traditionally been labeled as &quot;front&quot; vowels and &quot;back&quot; vowels. However, an analysis of these groups under the rubric of advanced tongue root or +ATR and non-advanced tongue root or -ATR seems more appropriate. There is also one neutral vowel, /i/, which does not belong to either group.
All the vowels in a non-compound word, including all its suffixes, must belong to the same group. If the first vowel is -ATR, then every vowel of the word must be either  or a -ATR vowel. Likewise, if the first vowel is a +ATR vowel, then every vowel of the word must be either  or a +ATR vowel. In the case of suffixes, which must change their vowels to conform to different words, two patterns predominate. Some suffixes can occur with , following the last phonemic vowel in the word stem, in which case underlying  are realized as  respectively. For example:
{|
|  &lt;U+2018&gt;household&lt;U+2019&gt; || + ||  (instrumental) || &lt;U+2192&gt; ||  &lt;U+2018&gt;by a household&lt;U+2019&gt; |- |  &lt;U+2018&gt;sentry&lt;U+2019&gt; || + ||  (instrumental) || &lt;U+2192&gt; ||  &lt;U+2018&gt;by a sentry&lt;U+2019&gt; |}
Other suffixes can occur in either , in which case all -ATR vowels lead to  and all +ATR vowels lead to . For example:
{|
|  &lt;U+2018&gt;to take&lt;U+2019&gt; || + ||  (causative) || &lt;U+2192&gt; ||  |}
If the only vowel in the word stem is , the suffixes will use the +ATR suffix forms.24
Rounding harmony. Mongolian also has rounding harmony pertaining to open vowels only. If a stem contains /o/ (or ), a suffix that is specified for an open vowel will have [o] (or , respectively) as well. However, this process is blocked by the presence of /u/ (or ) and /ei/. Eg  'came in', but  'inserted'.25

Mongolian lacks a true phoneme ; instead, it has a voiced alveolar lateral fricative, , which is often realized as .26 In word-final position,  (if not followed by a vowel in historical forms) is realized as . The consonants in parentheses occur only in loanwords.27 In the consonant system, the occurrence of palatalized consonant phonemes seems to be restricted to words that contain pharyngeal vowels.28
Syllable structure and phonotactics
The maximal syllable is CVVCCC where the last C is a word-final suffix. A single short vowel rarely appears in syllable-final position, thus the syllables CV and V are avoided in any position that is not the first syllable of a word that contains at least two syllables. If a word was monosyllabic historically, *CV has become CVV. [&lt;U+014B&gt;] is restricted to codas (else &gt;[n]), and /p/ and  don&lt;U+2019&gt;t occur in codas for historical reasons. For two-consonant clusters, the following restrictions obtain:
a palatalized consonant can only be preceded by another palatalized consonant or sometimes  and 
/&lt;U+014B&gt;/ may only precede  and 
/j/ doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t seem to appear in second position
and  don&lt;U+2019&gt;t occur as first consonant and only as second consonant if preceded by /m/ or  or their palatalized counterparts.
Clusters that do not confirm to these restrictions will be broken up by a epenthetic non-phonemic vowel in a syllabification that takes place from right to left. For example, hojor 'two', a&lt;U+017E&gt;il 'work', and saarmag 'neutral' are, phonemically, , , and  respectively. In such cases, an epenthetic vowel is inserted so as to prevent disallowed consonant clusters. Thus, in the examples given above, the words are phonetically , , and . The phonetic form of the epenthetic vowel follows from vowel harmony triggered by the vowel in the preceding syllable. Usually it is a centralized version of the same sound, with the following exceptions: preceding  produces ,  will be ignored if there is a non-neutral vowel earlier in the word, and a postalveolar or palatalized consonant will be followed by an epenthetic , as in .29
Stress
Stress in Mongolian does not distinguish between different meanings and is thus supposed to depend entirely on syllable structure. Beyond this, there is little agreement among scholars.30 In one line of reasoning, stress falls on the rightmost heavy syllable unless this syllable is word-final:31
{|
| H&lt;U+02C8&gt;HLL ||  || &quot;to be organized&quot; |- | LH&lt;U+02C8&gt;HL ||  || &quot;to separate (modal)&quot; |- | LHH&lt;U+02C8&gt;HL ||  || &quot;the residents of Ulaanbaatar&quot; |- | H&lt;U+02C8&gt;HH ||  || &quot;angrily&quot; |- | &lt;U+02C8&gt;HLH ||  || &quot;sad&quot; |}
A &quot;heavy syllable&quot; is defined here as one that is at least the length of a full vowel; short word-initial syllables are thus excluded. Therefore, if a word is bisyllabic and the only heavy syllable is word-final, it gets stressed anyway. However, in a case where there is only one phonemic short word-initial syllable, even this syllable can get the stress:32
{|
| L&lt;U+02C8&gt;H ||  || &quot;goose&quot; |- | &lt;U+02C8&gt;LLL ||  || &quot;having read&quot; |}
There are other, widely divergent opinions: Most native linguists, independent of dialect, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several works by Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress.33
Grammar
The following description is based primarily on Standard Khalkha Mongolian (ie standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar as distinct from actual research into the linguistic behaviour of certain groups of individuals), but much of it is also valid for Southern Central Mongolian, especially Chakhar.34
Morphology
Modern Mongolian is an agglutinative, almost exclusively suffixing language;35 the suffixes are most often composed of a single morpheme. It has a rich number of morphemes to build up more complex words from simple roots. For example, the word  consists of the root  &lt;U+2018&gt;to be&lt;U+2019&gt;, an epenthetic &lt;-g-&gt;, the causative &lt;-uul-&gt; (then &lt;U+2018&gt;to found&lt;U+2019&gt;), the derivative suffix &lt;-laga&gt; that forms nouns created by the action (&lt;U+2018&gt;organisation&lt;U+2019&gt;) and the complex suffix &lt;&lt;U+2013&gt;ynh&gt; denoting something that belongs to the modified word (&lt;-yn&gt; would be genitive).36
Nominal compounds are quite frequent. Some derivational verbal suffixes are rather productive, eg &lt;jar&lt;U+2019&gt;-&gt; 'to speak',  'to speak with each other'. Formally, verbal suffixes that create independent words can roughly be divided into three classes: final verbs, which can only be used sentence-finally, i.e. &lt;-na&gt; (mainly future or generic statements) or &lt;U+2013&gt;&lt;U+00F8&gt; (second person imperative);37 participles (often called &lt;U+201C&gt;verbal nouns&lt;U+201D&gt;), which can be used clause-finally or attributively, i.e. &lt;-san&gt; (perfect-past)38 or &lt;-maar&gt; (&lt;U+2018&gt;want to&lt;U+2019&gt;); and converbs, which can link clauses or function adverbially, i.e. &lt;-&lt;U+017E&gt;&gt; (qualifies for any adverbial function or neutrally connects two sentences) or &lt;-tal&gt; (the action of the main clause takes place until the action expressed by the suffixed verb begins).39
Roughly speaking, Mongolian has eight cases: nominative (unmarked), genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, instrumental, comitative and directional.40 A direct object must take the accusative if it is definite, while it may not take it if it is indefinite and unspecific.41 In addition to case, a number of postpositions exist that usually govern genitive, ablative or comitative case or an oblique form, that is, the stem plus sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or analogy (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix).42 Nouns can take reflexive-possessive clitics indicating that the marked noun is possessed by the subject of the sentence: &lt;Bi najz(-)aa avarsan&gt; I friend-reflexive-possessive save-perfect &lt;U+2018&gt;I saved my friend&lt;U+2019&gt;.43 There are also somewhat noun-like adjectives that, however, seem to be only able to immediately take case suffixes in the case of ellipsis.44 Plurality may be unmarked, but there are overt markers some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually doesn't take any plural affix.45
Personal pronouns exist for the first and second person, while the old demonstrative pronouns have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include interrogative pronouns, conjunctions (which take participles), spatials and quite a few particles.46
Negation is mostly expressed by &lt;-g&lt;U+00FC&gt;j&gt; after participles and by the negation particle &lt;bi&lt;U+0161&gt;&gt; after nouns and adjectives; negation particles preceding the verb (for example in converbal constructions) exist, but tend to be replaced by analytical constructions.47
Syntax
Phrase structure
The noun phrase has the order: demonstrative pronoun/numeral, adjective, noun.48 Attributive sentences precedes the whole NP. Titles or occupations of people, low numerals indicating groups and focus clitics are put behind the head noun.49 Possessive pronouns (in different forms) may either precede or follow the NP.50 Eg &lt;bidnij uulzsan ter sajhan zaluugaas &lt;U+010D&gt;&gt; we-genitive meet-perfective that beautiful young_man-ablative focus &lt;U+2018&gt;even from that beautiful young man that we have met&lt;U+2019&gt;, &lt;Dor&lt;U+017E&gt; bag&lt;U+0161&gt; maan&lt;U+2019&gt;&gt; Dorj teacher our &lt;U+2018&gt;our teacher Dorj&lt;U+2019&gt;.
The verbal phrase consists of the predicate&lt;U+2019&gt;s complements and the adverbials modifying it in front of it and, mainly if the predicate is sentence-final, modal particles51 behind it. For example, &lt;Ter helehg&lt;U+00FC&gt;jgeer &lt;U+00FC&gt;nijg bi&lt;U+010D&gt;sen &lt;U+0161&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;&gt; S/he without_saying it-accusative write-perfective particle &lt;U+2018&gt;She wrote it without saying [i.e. that she would do so] (so I can assure you).&lt;U+2019&gt; In this clause the adverbial should precede the complement as it is itself derived from a verb and could take &lt;U+2018&gt;it&lt;U+2019&gt; as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective &lt;U+00E0&gt; la  'fast', it could immediately precede the predicate. There are also instances in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.52
The predicate itself may consist of a noun or an adjective with or without a copula.53 Most often, of course, a verb is used. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart among other meanings can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the position immediately behind the verb, eg &lt;uu&lt;U+017E&gt; orhison&gt; drink-CV leave-perfect 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary  &lt;U+2018&gt;to be&lt;U+2019&gt;, eg &lt;Ter g&lt;U+00FC&gt;j&lt;U+017E&gt; bajna&gt; s/he run-converb be-nonpast &lt;U+2018&gt;She is running&lt;U+2019&gt;. Meanings expressed in this position are aspectual in nature, eg progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by  may follow, eg  s/he come-perfect be-nonpast &lt;U+2018&gt;He has come&lt;U+2019&gt;. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual meaning as well. This position can be occupied more than once in one predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality and aspect.54
Clauses
Unmarked phrase order is subject&lt;U+2013&gt;object&lt;U+2013&gt;predicate.55 While the predicate generally has to remain in clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear.56 The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather at the end of the clause.57 Topic can be overtly marked with  that can also mark contrastive focus,58 overt additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic &lt;&lt;U+010D&gt;&gt;,59 overt restrictive focus with the clitic  ('only').60
Mongolian has passive and causative voice. In a passive sentence the entirely oblique agent takes either dative or instrumental case, the first of which is more common. The verb takes a suffix &lt;-gd-&gt;. In the causative, the person caused to do something would take instrumental, or accusative, if the simple verb would have been intransitive, and the verb would take &lt;-uul-&gt;. Causative morphology is also used in some passive contexts: &lt;Bi t&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;nd &lt;U+010D&gt;aduulsan&gt; I s/he-dative fool-caustive-perfective &lt;U+2018&gt;I was fooled by her/him&lt;U+2019&gt;. Animacy is an important component, thus English 'The bread was eaten by me' would not be acceptable in Mongolian. &lt;-ld-&gt; (reciprocal), &lt;-tsgaa-&gt; (plurative) and &lt;-lts-&gt; (cooperative) are voice constructions as well.61
Mongolian allows for adjectival depictives that either relate to the subject or the direct object, eg &lt;Ljena n&lt;U+00FC&gt;cgen untdag&gt; &lt;U+2018&gt;Lena sleeps naked&lt;U+2019&gt;, while adjectival resultatives are marginal.62
Complex sentences
One way to conjoin clauses is to have the first clause end in a converb. An example: &lt;Bid &lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;nijg olbol &lt;U+010D&gt;amd &lt;U+00F6&gt;gn&lt;U+00F6&gt;&gt; we it-accusative find-conditional_converbal_suffix you-dative give-future &lt;U+2018&gt;If we find it we&lt;U+2019&gt;ll give it to you&lt;U+2019&gt;. Some verbal nouns in the instrumental or most often dative function very similar to converbs:63 above sentence with  find-imperfective-dative &lt;U+2018&gt;When I find it I&lt;U+2019&gt;ll give it to you&lt;U+2019&gt;. Quite often, postpositions govern complete clauses. In contrast, conjunctions take verbal nouns without case:64 &lt;jadarsan u&lt;U+010D&gt;raas untlaa&gt; become_tired-perfective because sleep-witnessed_perfective 'I slept because I was tired'. Finally, there are usually clause-initial particles with relating meaning: &lt;Bi olson, harin &lt;U+010D&gt;amd &lt;U+00F6&gt;g&lt;U+00F6&gt;hg&lt;U+00FC&gt;j&gt; I find-perfective but you-dative give-imperfective-negation &lt;U+2018&gt;I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve found it, but I won&lt;U+2019&gt;t give it to you&lt;U+2019&gt;.
Mongolian has a complementizer auxiliary verb  very similar to Japanese to iu.  literally means &lt;U+2018&gt;to say&lt;U+2019&gt; and in converbal form &lt;ge&lt;U+017E&gt;&gt; precedes a psych verb or verb of saying. As a verbal noun like  (with &lt;n&lt;U+2019&gt;&gt; or case) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As  it may function as an evidentialis marker.65
Mongolian clauses tend to be arranged in a paratactic order, allowing for clauses that are syntactically subordinate, but resemble coordinated structures in European languages:66 &lt;Ter ireed namajg &lt;U+00FC&gt;nssen&gt; that come-converb me_accusative kiss-perfect &lt;U+2018&gt;S/he came and kissed me.&lt;U+2019&gt;
In the subordinate clause the subject, if different from the subject of main clause, sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case.67 Subjects in either the ablative case marginally occur as well.68 Subjects of attribute clauses in which the head has a function (as is the case for all English relative clauses) demand that if the subject is not the head it usually takes the genitive case,69 eg &lt;t&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;nij idsen hool&gt; that_one-genitive eat-perfective meal &lt;U+2018&gt;the meal that s/he had eaten&lt;U+2019&gt;.
Lexicon
The Mongolian vocabulary includes historic loanwords especially from Old Turkic, Sanskrit (often through Uigur), Persian, Arabic, Tibetan,70 Tungusic and Chinese71 and keeps adopting more recent ones from Russian, English72 and Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia).73 Commissions in the Mongolian state have been busy translating new terminology into Mongolian,74 so that Mongolian words such as 'president' &lt;jer&lt;U+00F6&gt;nhijl&lt;U+00F6&gt;g&lt;U+010D&gt;&gt; (&quot;generalizer&quot;) and 'beer' &lt;&lt;U+0161&gt;ar ajrag&gt; (&quot;yellow kumys&quot;) exist. There are quite a few loan translations, eg  ('fire-having cart') 'train' from Chinese hu&lt;U+01D2&gt;ch&lt;U+0113&gt; (&lt;U+706B&gt;&lt;U+8F66&gt;, fire cart) 'train'.75
Writing systems
Mongolian has been written in a variety of alphabets. The traditional Mongolian script was adapted from Uyghur script probably at the very beginning of the 13th century and from that time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a preparatory phase, the Cyrillic script was declared as mandatory by government decree. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt was made to reintroduce the traditional alphabet which failed due to popular resistance.76 In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of Latin is common as well.77
In the People's Republic of China, Mongolian is a co-official language with Mandarin Chinese in some regions, notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet has always been used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split.78 There are two types of written Mongolian used in China: the classical script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the Clear script, used predominantly among Oirats in Xinjiang.79
The modified Cyrillic alphabet used for Mongolian is as follows:

&lt;U+04AE&gt;&lt;U+04AF&gt; and &lt;U+04E8&gt;&lt;U+04E9&gt; are sometimes also written as &lt;U+0407&gt;&lt;U+0457&gt; and &lt;U+0404&gt;&lt;U+0454&gt;.80
Historical Mongolian
 The earliest surviving Mongolian text is the Stele of Yis&lt;U+00FC&gt;ngge, a report on sports in Mongolian script on stone, that is most often dated at the verge of 1224 and 1225.81 Other early sources are written in Mongolian, Phagspa (decrees), Chinese (The Secret History of the Mongols), Arabic (dictionaries) and a few Western scripts.82 These comprise the Middle Mongolian language that was spoken from the 13th to the early 15th83 or late 16th century.84 The documents in Mongolian script show some distinct linguistic characteristics and are therefore often distinguished by terming their language &quot;Preclassical Mongolian&quot;.85 The next distinct period is Classical Mongolian that is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. It is a written language with a high degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kanjur and Tanjur86 as well as several chronicles.87 In 1686, the Soyombo script (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.88
Changes in phonology
Consonants
Middle Mongolian documents show only two velar plosives  and  (and one allophone for each), but in some instances the  disappeared and in others not. There is no hint as to how this might be related to contextual factors, and while there is a hypothesis that this is related to distinctive vowel length or stress,89 it is disputed whether there is any factual evidence for this. Now there is a word-initial  that disappeared during the Middle Mongolian stage. This might be the same phoneme as one of the instances of  (possibly ). Thus, it is likely that x &lt;U+2192&gt; h &lt;U+2192&gt; &lt;U+00D8&gt;.90 Eg Phagspa , Preclassical Mongolian , reconstructed in Proto-Mongolic as *haran &lt;U+2018&gt;person&lt;U+2019&gt;, became Modern Mongolian .91 Phagspa &lt;U+010D&gt;aqa&lt;U+2019&gt;an, Preclassical &lt;U+010D&gt;a&lt;U+03B3&gt;a&lt;U+03B3&gt;an,92 reconstructed for Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic as  &lt;U+2018&gt;white&lt;U+2019&gt;, became Modern Mongolian . As also apparent from this example, affricates were fronted in Northern Modern Mongolian dialects such as Khalkha.  was spirantized to  in Ulaanbaatar Khalkha and the Mongolian dialects south of it, eg Preclassical Mongolian &lt;k&lt;U+00FC&gt;nd&lt;U+00FC&gt;&gt;, reconstructed as  &lt;U+2018&gt;heavy&lt;U+2019&gt;, became Modern Mongolian 93 (but in the vinicity of Bayankhongor and Baruun-Urt, many speakers will say ).94 Originally word-final /n/ turned into /&lt;U+014B&gt;/; if  was originally followed by a vowel that later dropped, it remained unchanged, eg  became , but  became . After i-breaking,  became phonemic. Consonants in words containing back vowels that were followed by  in Proto-Mongolian became palatalized in Modern Mongolian. In some words, word-final  was dropped with most case forms, but still appears with the ablative, dative and genitive.95
Vowels
Proto-Mongolic had . First,  and  were pharyngealized to  and , then  and  were velarized to  and . Thus, the vowel harmony shifted from a velar to a pharyngeal paradigm.  in the first syllable of back-vocalic words was assimilated to the following vowel; in word-initial position it became .  followed by  was rounded to . VhV and VjV sequences where the second vowel was any vowel but  were monophthongized. Short vowels in any syllable but the first were deleted from the phonetic representation of the word; long vowels in these positions became short vowels.96
Eg  ( becomes ,  disappears) &lt;U+2192&gt;  (instable n drops; vowel reduction) &lt;U+2192&gt; jama(n) &lt;U+2018&gt;goat&lt;U+2019&gt;
and  (regressive rounding assimilation) &lt;U+2192&gt;  (vowel velarization) &lt;U+2192&gt;  (vowel reduction) &lt;U+2192&gt; oms- &lt;U+2018&gt;to wear&lt;U+2019&gt;
Changes in morphology
Nominal system
 While most case suffixes did change somewhat in form, ie were shortened, most of the modern case system remained intact; important changes occurred with the comitative and the dative.97 The Middle Mongolian comitative &lt;-lu&lt;U+03B3&gt;-a&gt; could not be used attributively, but it was replaced by the suffix &lt;-taj&gt; that originally derived adjectives denoting possession of the stem from nouns, eg  &lt;U+2018&gt;having a horse&lt;U+2019&gt; became &lt;mor&lt;U+2019&gt;toj&gt; &lt;U+2018&gt;having a horse/with a horse&lt;U+2019&gt;. As this adjective functioned parallel to &lt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;gej&gt; &lt;U+2018&gt;not having&lt;U+2019&gt;, it has been suggested that a &lt;U+201C&gt;privative case&lt;U+201D&gt; (&lt;U+2018&gt;without&lt;U+2019&gt;) has been introduced into Mongolian.98 There have been three different case suffixes in the dative-locative-directive domain that are grouped in different ways: &lt;-a&gt; as locative and &lt;-dur&gt;, &lt;-da&gt; as dative99 or &lt;-da&gt; and &lt;-a&gt; as dative and &lt;-dur&gt; as locative,100 in both cases with some functional overlapping. As &lt;-dur&gt; seems to be grammaticalized from  &lt;U+2018&gt;within&lt;U+2019&gt;, thus indicating a span of time,101 the second account seems to be more likely. Of these, &lt;-da&gt; got lost, &lt;-dur&gt; was first reduced to &lt;-du&gt; and then to /d/102 and &lt;-a&gt; only survived in a few frozen environments.103 Finally, the directive of modern Mongolian &lt;-ruu&gt; has been innovated from &lt;uru&lt;U+03B3&gt;u&gt; 'downwards'.104 Gender agreement was abandoned.105
Verbal system
Middle Mongolian had a slightly greater set of declarative final verb suffix forms106 and a smaller number of participles which were less likely to be used as finite predicates.107 The linking converb &lt;-n&gt; became confined to stable verb combinations,108 while the number of converbs somewhat increased.109 The gender and number distinction exhibited by some final verbs got lost.110
Changes in syntax
Neutral word order in clauses with pronominal subject changed from object&lt;U+2013&gt;predicate&lt;U+2013&gt;subject to subject&lt;U+2013&gt;object&lt;U+2013&gt;predicate, eg
K&lt;U+00F6&gt;kse&lt;U+00FC&gt; sabraq &lt;U+00FC&gt;g&lt;U+00FC&gt;.le-run 'ayyi. yeke uge ugu.le-d ta ...' kee-j&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;.y.
K. s. speak-converb alas big word speak-Past you say-nonfuture
'K&lt;U+00F6&gt;kse&lt;U+00FC&gt; sabraq spoke saying &quot;Alas. You speak a great boast. ...&quot;'111
The negation of verbs shifted from negation particles preceding final verbs to a negation particle following participles; thus, as final verbs could no longer be negated, their paradigm of negation was filled by particles.112 For example, Preclassical Mongolian  'did not come' vs. modern spoken Mongolian &lt;ireeg&lt;U+00FC&gt;j&gt; (modern written Mongolian &lt;irege &lt;U+00FC&gt;gei&gt;) 'did not come (yet)' or &lt;irseng&lt;U+00FC&gt;j&gt; 'did not come (then)'.

Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 265&lt;U+2013&gt;266.↩
Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 266 classify it as a variety of &quot;Inner Mongolian&quot; according to morphological criteria, while Svantesson et al. 2005: 148 classify it as a variety of Oirat according to phonological criteria.

For example Svantesson et al. 2005: 143, Poppe 1955: 110&lt;U+2013&gt;115.↩
Svantesson et al. 2006: 159&lt;U+2013&gt;160; the difference between the l-s might just be due to the impossibility of reconstructing something as detailed as  for Proto-Mongolic and imprecision or convenience in notation for Chakhar (Chakhar phonemes according to Dobu 1983).↩
For example &lt;Bi teg&lt;U+00FC&gt;n-i taniei&gt; I him know-JEI &lt;U+2018&gt;I knew him&lt;U+2019&gt; is accepted and ?&lt;Bi &lt;U+00F6&gt;&lt;U+010D&gt;&lt;U+00F6&gt;ged&lt;U+00FC&gt;r iregsen&gt; rejected by an Inner Mongolian grammarian from Khorchin (Chuluu 1998: 140, 165); in Khalkha, by contrast, the first sentence would not appear with the meaning attributed to it, while the second is perfectly acceptable.↩
See, for example, &lt;U+010C&gt;inggeltei 1959. Notice that this split is blurred by the school grammar which treats several dialectal varieties as one coherent grammatical system (for example &lt;U+010C&gt;inggeltei 1999 [1979]). This understanding is in turn reflected in the undecided treatment of - in research work like Bayan&lt;U+010D&gt;o&lt;U+03B3&gt;tu 2002: 306.↩

Walker&lt;U+2019&gt;s evidence is based on one informant, examples from Poppe 1970 and consultation with James Bosson. She defines stress in terms of pitch, duration and intensity. The analysis pertains to the Khalkha dialect. The phoneme analysis in the examples is adjusted to Svantesson et al. 2005.↩
Some works published between 1835 and 1915 state other positions. Moreover, K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ke 2003 seems to contain yet another, new position. See Svantesson et al. 2005: 95&lt;U+2013&gt;97 and the literature cited there.↩
