On 17 February 2008, the Assembly of Kosovo, a body of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government under the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), unilaterally declared independece. This move was controversial among the international community. As of 9 October 2008 the Republic of Kosovo has been recognised by  UN member states and the Republic of China (Taiwan).
At present, fourteen states maintain embassies in Pristina; additionally, Liechtenstein's interests are represented by the Swiss embassy. Kosovo is also host to six non-resident ambassadors, as well as 10 liaison offices. Russia maintains a liaison office with UNMIK.
The government of the Republic of Kosovo has allocated one million euros to establish a Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Skender Hyseni has been requested to be the Foreign Minister.1
Europe
European Union
The European Union does not possess the legal capacity to diplomatically recognise any state; member states do so individually. The majority of member states have recognised Kosovo. To articulate a common EU policy of either support or opposition to Kosovan independence would require unanimity on the subject from all 27 member states, which does not presently exist. On 18 February, the EU officially stated that it would take note of the resolution of the Kosovo assembly.2 The EU is sending a EULEX mission to Kosovo, which includes a special representative and 2000 police and judicial personnel.34 
Estonia
The Republic of Estonia and the Republic of Kosovo established diplomatic relations on April 24 in 2008. Estonia, having previously announced readiness to recognize Kosovo's independence, officially recognized Kosovo on February 21 in 2008.5
France
Luxembourg
Luxembourg has promised to give Kosovo &lt;U+20AC&gt;30 million over the next five years. Luxembourg said that the money was mainly for focus on professional training for Pristina and Mitrovica North authorities.6
Poland
Poland recognised Kosovo on 26 February 2008.7 In September 2008, President of Poland, Lech Kaczy&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, stated that the that the original cause of the 2008 South Ossetia war was not the Georgian operation, but the recognition of Kosovo's independence8 and that he would block attempts to establish diplomatic relations of Poland with Kosovo at ambassadorial level; however, the government has not proposed to send an ambassador to Pristina.9
United Kingdom
Albania
Albania has offered Kosovo a $3 billion pipeline deal from hydropower stations in Albania, so that Kosovo can stay powered as the new semi-recognized state has not been fully able to sort out its power supply since becoming independent. 10
Macedonia
The Republic of Macedonia recognised Kosovo on 8 October 2008.11

Bangladesh
Bangladesh also sent its personnel to contribute towards the peacekeeping operations since the Kosovo crisis began and recently sent 120 policemen to the UN Kosovo mission. 12
Bangladesh originally declared that it will review the situation of Kosovo's independence and determine their actions afterwards. After a meeting between Fakhruddin Ahmed and James F. Moriarty, Bangladesh has shown intentions of recognising the new nation soon.
On 29 June 2008 the Prime Minister, Fakhruddin Ahmed, during a meeting with the United States Ambassador to Bangladesh, James F. Moriarty, has affirmed that &quot;Bangladesh will recognize the new European country&quot;. The Prime Minister also assured the US ambassador that &quot;Bangladesh is committed to lobbying Asian Muslim countries to recognize Kosovo. Bangladesh will actively contribute to the development of Kosovo&quot;.13
Japan
South Korea
Middle East
Arab states
Only one of the Arab countries have so far recognised the independence of Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates on 14 October 2008. Skender Hyseni met with ambassadors of Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and UAE in May 2008 in Vienna. Qatar and Saudi Arabia indicated they had begun the recognition process and Abdulrahman Al-Suahibani, Charg&lt;U+00E9&gt; d'Affaires of the Saudi Arabian embassy in Vienna told Hyseni that he had been &quot;instructed by his government to communicate to Kosovo&lt;U+2019&gt;s Foreign Minister that Saudi Arabia will recognise Kosovo very soon&quot;.14 Later a dialogue has started in Kosovo between representatives from Kosovar and Arab civil society groups. However, this dialogue is opposed by the Kosovar government as some of the Arab representatives are dissidents in Arab states.
Israel
The issue of Kosovo is sensitive to Israelis, many of whom are descendants of survivors of various ethnic cleansing campaigns and genocides, including: the Holocaust. Israelis have aided Kosovo refugees in the past, including establishing the only hospital for miles on Macedonia's border. Many Israelis have rallied in support of the Kosovar cause.15 Jerusalem sent massive humanitarian aide to the besieged Kosovars during and after the 1998-1999 Kosovo War. Jewish groups worldwide are also involved in aide to Kosovo's Muslim majority, and even helped to rebuild mosques damaged during the fighting. The Israeli government has delayed recognizing Kosovo and chooses to monitor developments in the region and international community before making a decision. Some concerns include the fact the secession is unilateral, and that recognition may have implications on the Palestinian (and Israeli Arab) issue&lt;U+2014&gt;an analogy the Albanian ambassador in Israel rejects, citing major historical and political differences.1617 Israel and Serbia also share increasingly close economic ties, and Serbia's ambassador in Israel claims he has been assured by Israeli officials that Israel will not recognize Kosovo.18 However, Israeli officials indicate that that recognition is probably just a matter of time considering Israel's closest ally (the United States) and other &quot;influential friends&quot; in Europe have recognized the new state.12 Israel supports the Contact Group principles.19
