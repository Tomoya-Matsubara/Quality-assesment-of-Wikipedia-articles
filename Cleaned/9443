University of the Arts London (formerly the London Institute) is a public research university located in London, United Kingdom specialised in art, design, fashion and media.1 It is a collegiate university comprising six constituent colleges: Camberwell College of Arts, Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, Chelsea College of Art and Design, London College of Communication, London College of Fashion and Wimbledon College of Art.
The university is Europe's largest provider of education in art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts.2 It brings together 19,000 students from over 100 different countries, including 2,250 further education students, 14,000 undergraduates and 2,700 postgraduate and research students. It is also a leading provider of short courses on creative subjects, with around 20,000 people aged 10 to 82 taking a course across the academic year.
The University wholly owns the UAL Awarding Body, which designs, assesses and awards pre-university arts and design qualifications, and validates more than half of the UK's foundation diplomas.
History
Camberwell College of Arts
The University has its origins in seven previously independent art, design, fashion and media colleges, which were brought together for administrative purposes to form the London Institute in 1986.3 They were: Saint Martin's School of Art; Chelsea School of Art; the London College of Printing; the Central School of Art and Design; Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts; the College for Distributive Trades; and the London College of Fashion.4 The colleges were originally established from the mid 19th century to the early 20th century.
Under the Education Reform Act 1988, the London Institute became a single legal entity, and the first court of governors were instated the following year in 1989. The first appointed Rector was John McKenzie. The London Institute was incorporated as a higher education body in 1991 and was later granted academic degree awarding powers in 1993 by the Privy Council. Will Wyatt was appointed Chairman of Governors during the same year. Sir William Stubbs was appointed the second Rector after the retirement of McKenzie in 1996. A coat of arms was granted to the London Institute in 1998. Lord Stevenson was appointed the first chancellor in 2000.
On the retirement of Sir William Stubbs, Sir Michael Bichard was appointed as Rector in 2001 and encouraged the London Institute to apply for University status. The London Institute originally chose not to apply because its individual colleges were internationally recognised in their own right.5 In 2003, the London Institute received Privy Council approval for university status and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004.6
Wimbledon School of Art joined the university as a sixth college in 2006, and was renamed Wimbledon College of Art. Sir John Tusa was appointed as the new Chairman, replacing Will Wyatt, in 2007. Nigel Carrington, an international lawyer and former managing director of the McLaren Group, was appointed Rector in 2008, replacing Sir Michael Bichard.7
From 2008 to 2010, a far-reaching efficiency programme saw a number of staff made redundant and courses close.89
In 2011 playwright and actor Kwame Kwei-Armah became Chancellor, crowning an association with the University that began in 2002 when he studied for a Screenwriting MA at London College of Communication.
Central Saint Martins relocated to a purpose built complex situated in King's Cross in June 2011.1011
In 2012, the university commissioned Pentagram to rebrand its identity which has now been rolled out successfully across all six colleges.
Colleges
The University of the Arts London has six constituent colleges.
Camberwell College of Arts
Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts was established by the Technical Education Board of the London County Council on 10 January 1898, in a building beside the South London Art Gallery, with the financial support of John Passmore Edwards and following advocacy by Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, Walter Crane and G.F. Watts. The subjects taught were mainly technical until a Fine Arts department was established between the Wars. The school became part of the London Institute in January 1986, and was renamed Camberwell College of Arts in 1989.12
Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 by the merger of Saint Martin's School of Art, founded 1854, and the Central School of Art and Design, founded as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896. Drama Centre London, founded in 1963, became part of Central Saint Martins in 1999,13 and the Byam Shaw School of Art, founded in 1910, was merged into CSM in 2003. The school was renamed Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design in 2011.14
Chelsea College of Art and Design
The Chelsea School of Art originated as part of the South-Western Polytechnic, which opened in 1895 and in 1922 became the Chelsea Polytechnic. In 1957 the science department of the polytechnic was renamed Chelsea College of Science and Technology; the School of Art became independent from it at that time, and merged with the Regent Street Polytechnic School of Art to create the Chelsea School of Art in 1964. In 1975 Chelsea merged with Hammersmith College of Art and Building, founded in 1891 by Francis Hawke and taken over by the London County Council in 1904. The Chelsea School of Art became part of the London Institute in 1986 and was renamed Chelsea College of Art and Design in 1989.15
London College of Communication
The London College of Printing descends from the St Bride's Foundation Institute Printing School, which was established in November 1894 under the City of London Parochial Charities Act of 1883. The Guild and Technical School opened in Clerkenwell in the same year, but moved a year later to Bolt Court, and became the Bolt Court Technical School; it was later renamed the London County Council School of Photoengraving and Lithography. St Bride's came under the control of the London County Council in 1922 and was renamed the London School of Printing and Kindred Trades; in 1949 it was merged with the LCC School of Photoengraving and Lithography, forming the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts. In 1960 this was renamed the London College of Printing. The printing department of the North Western Polytechnic was merged into it in 1969. The London College of Printing became part of the London Institute in 1986.
The Westminster Day Continuation School opened in 1921, and was later renamed the College for Distributive Trades. It became part of the London Institute in 1986. In 1990 it merged with the London College of Printing to form the London College of Printing and Distributive Trades, which in 1996 was renamed the London College of Communication.16
London College of Fashion
The London College of Fashion derives from three trade schools for women, the Shoreditch Technical Institute Girls Trade School, founded in 1906, Barrett Street Trade School, founded in 1915, and Clapham Trade School, founded in 1927; all were established by the Technical Education board of the London County Council to train skilled workers for the clothing and hairdressing trades.17 The Barrett Street school became a technical college after the 1944 Education Act and was renamed Barrett Street Technical College. Shoreditch also became a technical college; in 1955 it merged with Clapham Trade School to form Shoreditch College for the Garment Trades. In 1966 it was renamed Shoreditch College for the Clothing Industry and in 1967 merged with Barrett Street Technical College to become the London College for the Garment Trades, which in 1974 was renamed the London College of Fashion.1819 It became part of the London Institute in January 1986. In August 2000 it merged with Cordwainers College, founded as the Leather Trade School by the Leathersellers and Cordwainers Company in 1887 in Bethnal Green, and later renamed the Cordwainers Technical College and, in 1991, Cordwainers College.20
Wimbledon College of Art
The foundation of Wimbledon College of Art goes back to 1890, when an art class for the Rutlish School for Boys was started. Between 1904 and 1920 this was housed in the Wimbledon Technical Institute in Gladstone Road. It became independent in 1930 and moved to Merton Hall Road in 1940. Theatre design was taught from 1932, and became a department in 1948. In 1993 the school, which previously had been controlled by the London Borough of Merton, was incorporated as an independent higher education institution. Wimbledon School of Art became part of University of the Arts London in 2006 and was renamed Wimbledon College of Art.21

Research
 The 2001 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) published results by subject area on a point scale from 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4, 5 to 5*, the University achieved a 5 rating. In 2006-07, this rating equated to a QR grant of &lt;U+00A3&gt;8.6 million.27
In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise the Times Higher Education's RAE league tables placed the University of the Arts 44th out of 132 universities in the institution-wide table. In the 'Art and Design' subject tables the University was placed 22nd out of 72 submissions (for 'submission A' - the majority of the constituent colleges) and 23rd out of 72 submissions (for 'submission B' - Wimbledon College of Art alone).28 The University submitted by far the largest number of researchers in the Arts and Design subject area (237.89 full-time equivalent staff), next highest was Glasgow School of Art with only 76.85 FTE staff. More than 50 per cent of the University of the Arts' research submission was rated as world leading or internationally excellent, with 77.5 per cent recognised as internationally significant.2930
UAL's current research projects include:
Catalytic clothing - a fashion-science partnership between Helen Storey (London College of Fashion) and Tony Ryan (University of Sheffield) to harness the pollution-busting properties of titanium dioxide to create clothes that cleanse the air. The researchers are working with Ecover to develop a laundry additive that enables the oxide, which naturally reacts with light and air to break down pollutants, to grip onto fibres in materials.
Threat Mapping Web Application - a collaboration between Amanda Windle (London College of Communication), Microsoft Research Ltd and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to improve the accuracy and usability of the IUCN's Red List of species at risk. The new application will allow researchers and conservationists to see threats to species and actions taken to protect them in a dynamic way, live on a global map, and ebable them to edit, add and research new data as it is generated.
TED's ten - the Textiles Environmental Design group has created a toolkit of design rules - TED's ten - that tackle fashion's often inconsistent approach to sustainability. The strategies for fashion and textile designers promote approaches that build reuse and recycling into the design process and eradicate waste. The group is testing the strategies as part of the Swedish government-funded Future Fashion consortium, which is developing a new fibre called CelluNova using wood from pine trees.
The university's research outputs, many of them free to download, can also be found in the university's institutional research repository. Launched in February 2010, UAL Research Online 31 was developed from the Kultur project, funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and was a collaboration between University of Southampton, University of the Arts London, University for the Creative Arts and the Visual Arts Data Service. It is currently the largest Creative Arts research repository in the UK.32

Student life
The London College of Communication
Students' Union
SUArts is based at UAL's High Holborn HQ with representatives and activities at all Colleges. It lobbies and campaigns on issues important to creative students, including campaigning against unpaid interships. Clubs and societies cover sports, nationality, politics and identity, and hobbies and interests from dance, drama and fashion to chess, knitting and food.
Student Hub
The Student Hub is the central university office at High Holborn, which is used for administrative purposes, learning resources, support services and a students' union cafe/bar. The Hub includes:
the Learning Zone - a space for collaborative and private study; facilities include computers, laptop hire and rooms for presentations/rehearsals;
the International Centre - manages international student recruitment and its network of local representatives based across the world. The centre and the local representatives offer specialist advice, such as course information and University services, as well as advice on immigration and fees; and
the Language Centre - enables prospective students to study English and other modern languages, before and during their course.
Publications
The Student Union publishes Less Common More Sense, a magazine that serves to showcase student work from all six colleges. The University also publishes Arts London News, a weekly newspaper distributed throughout three terms of the year, which is produced, managed and edited during term time by Journalism and Photojournalism students at the London College of Communication. The paper is published in conjunction with News International.
Student Enterprise and Employability service
Creative graduates typically have less clearly defined career paths than those of other disciplines. They are highly entrepreneurial &lt;U+2013&gt; 18% of UAL graduates are self-employed three years after graduating compared to the national average of 5% - and tend to pursue flexible and varied &lt;U+2018&gt;portfolio&lt;U+2019&gt; careers, made up of self-employment, part-time and short-term contracts, freelancing, and creative practice.
To make sure that students and graduates are prepared for the careers they will enter and that basic career skills and knowledge are built into the University&lt;U+2019&gt;s curricula right from the start, UAL&lt;U+2019&gt;s Student Enterprise and Employability service was set up in September 2011.&lt;U+00A0&gt;The service provides advice, mentoring, events and surgeries focused on the basic skills that creative graduates need &lt;U+2013&gt; effective networking, business planning, pitching, presenting and marketing &lt;U+2013&gt; as well as more technical skills for successful entrepreneurship, including protecting your intellectual property,understanding legal contracts, accessing start-up funding, plus taking advantage of new models for business success, such as crowd funding and selling online.
SEE is a delivery partner for the Government&lt;U+2019&gt;s Start Up Loans Scheme, offers annual Creative Enterprise Awards for graduates and provides grants for early-stage businesses through its SEED Fund.&lt;U+00A0&gt;The service also offers relevant paid employment through ArtsTemps, UAL&lt;U+2019&gt;s in-house temp agency set up to help students and recent graduates develop employment skills as well as earn. ArtsTemps is the preferred supplier of temp staff across the University, and has now paid out over &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million in salaries.
SEE also helps students and graduates to find work placements and paid internships in organisations and businesses throughout the creative sector.&lt;U+00A0&gt;
SEE&lt;U+2019&gt;s third main focus is on supporting artists and craftspeople to develop their practice. It supports Artquest, a service providing practical peer support and networking to develop their ability to make, sell and find work. It has also set up Showroom &lt;U+2013&gt; a high profile shop and gallery at the front of UAL&lt;U+2019&gt;s Central London HQ that displays and sells work by UAL students and graduates.
Student housing
The University has 14 residences across London and aims to offer all first year students a room in University accommodation. New accommodation includes Camberwell Campus and the Costume Store in west London.
