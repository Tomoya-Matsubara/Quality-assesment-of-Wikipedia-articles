&quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is a song written and performed by Bob Dylan and first released on his 1965 album, Bringing It All Back Home. It was written in the summer of 1964, first performed live on October 10, 1964, and recorded on January 15, 1965. Described by Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as a &quot;grim masterpiece,&quot; the song features some of Dylan's most memorable lyrical images. Among the well-known lines sung in the song are &quot;Money doesn't talk, it swears,&quot; &quot;Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools&quot; and &quot;But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.&quot; The lyrics express Dylan's anger at hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, warmongers and contemporary American culture, but unlike his earlier protest songs, &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions.
Dylan has stated that &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is one of his songs that means the most to him, and he has played the song often in live concerts. Since its original release on Bringing It All Back Home, live versions of the song have been issued on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall, Before the Flood and Bob Dylan at Budokan. Dylan can also be seen performing the song in the film Don't Look Back and the video of the HBO special Hard to Handle. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, including Roger McGuinn, The Byrds, Billy Preston, Hugo Race, Terence Trent D'Arby, Mick Farren, Caetano Veloso, Marilyn Scott, and The Duhks.
Bob Dylan's version
Dylan wrote &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; in the summer of 1964.1 Although he was prepared to take his time developing the song, as he did with &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, he finished it in time for inclusion on the Bringing It All Back Home album, which was recorded in January 1965.2 Dylan first performed &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; live on October 10, 1964 at Philadelphia Town Hall.3 The version included on Bringing It All Back Home was recorded on January 15, 1965, the same day that the other three songs on side 2 of the album (&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, &quot;Gates of Eden&quot; and &quot;It's All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;) were recorded, with Tom Wilson in the role of producer.456 It was long thought that each of the four songs that make up side 2 of Bringing It All Back Home were recorded in one long take.7 However, there was actually one false take of &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot;.89
Dylan biographer Howard Sounes described &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; as a &quot;grim masterpiece.&quot;10 The only accompaniment is Dylan's guitar, playing folk-blues riffs and up and down chord progressions.11 Authour Sean Wilentz has noted that the song's chord structure is similar to that used by the Everly Brothers' in their hit recording of &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot;.12 The lyrics of &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; express Dylan's anger at hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, warmongers and contemporary American culture.131415 In his book Bob Dylan, Performing Artist, author Paul Williams has suggested that the song addresses &quot;the possibility that the most important (and least articulated) political issue of our times is that we are all being fed a false picture of reality, and it's coming at us from every direction.&quot;16 Williams goes on to say that the song successfully paints a portrait of an &quot;alienated individual identifying the characteristics of the world around him and thus declaring his freedom from its 'rules'.&quot;17 As such, a major target in the song is the old, established concepts which give a false picture of reality and hinder new worldviews from being accepted.18
While it shares a sense of prevailing entropy with the previous song on the album, &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, the critique in &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is more direct and less allusive.19 Author Michael Gray has commented that although the vitriol Dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs, &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is a transitionary song in that it does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions.20 Instead, Dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would later become his trademark.21 However, with the political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs, along with a more complex figurative language.22 Howard Sounes notes that the song features some of Dylan's most memorable images.23 The opening lines begin the song's torrent of apocalyptic images:24
''Darkness at the break of noon
''Shadows even the silver spoon
''The handmade blade, the child's balloon
''Eclipses both the sun and moon
''To understand you know too soon
''There is no sense in trying
According to Seth Rogovoy, this opening echoes the Book of Ecclesiastes, where the author states (1:17) &quot;I observed all deeds beneath the sun, and behold all is futile.25 There are echoes of Ecclesiastes throughout the song. Another example is:26
''The masters make the rules
''For the wise man and the fools.
The author of Ecclesiastes laments (2:15â€“16) &quot;The fate of the fool will befall me also; to what advantage, then, have I become wise? But I come to the conclusion that this, too, was futility, because the wise man and the fool are both forgotten. The wise man dies, just like the fool.&quot;
One of the most famous lines from the song reminds listeners that even the most powerful people will ultimately be judged:2728
''But even the president of the United States
''Sometimes must have to stand naked
These lines seemed particularly prescient when Dylan performed the song on his 1974 tour with The Band, a few months before Richard Nixon resigned as President of the United States as a result of the Watergate crisis.2930 After the song has confronted sex, religion and politics, it end with the lines:3132
''And if my thought-dreams could be seen
''They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
''But it's alright, Ma, it's life and life only
Throughout the song, the words pour out quickly, with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in the verses and AAB in the chorus.3334
Dylan has cited &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; as one of his songs that means the most to him.35 In 1980 he stated that &quot;I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it.&quot;36 The song has featured often in Dylan's live concerts, and concert performances of it have been released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall (recorded on October 31, 1964), Before the Flood (recorded in 1974) and Bob Dylan at Budokan (recorded in 1978).37 Dylan also played the song on his Rolling Thunder Revue Tour in 1975 and 1976, as well as on his 1978 tour and his Never Ending Tour from the late 1980s up to the present.38 Footage of Dylan playing &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; is included in the film Don't Look Back, and a live performance of Dylan playing the song with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers is included in the video of the HBO special Hard to Handle.3940 Dylan also sang this song at his 1993 30th anniversary celebration concert at Madison Square Garden, which was released on The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration album.41 The studio recording was re-released on the 2008 compilation album Playlist: The Very Best of Bob Dylan '60s.42
Cover versions
Arguably the most widely known cover of the song is that performed by Roger McGuinn for the soundtrack of the 1969 film, Easy Rider. The film's scriptwriter and star, Peter Fonda, had originally intended to use Dylan's version of the song in the film but after failing to secure the appropriate licensing he asked McGuinn to record a cover of it instead.4344 Although McGuinn's version of &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; was listed as a solo performance on the Easy Rider soundtrack album, it actually features McGuinn on guitar and vocals, accompanied by his bandmate from The Byrds, Gene Parsons, on harmonica.45
The Byrds themselves, also recorded a version of the song during the 1970 recording sessions for their album (Untitled) but it was not included in the final track listing.46 The Byrds occasionally performed the song in concert during 1970 and a live recording of it, from a March 1, 1970 appearance at the Felt Forum, was included on the 2000 remaster of the (Untitled) album, which was re-titled as (Untitled)/(Unissued).4748 This version also appears as a bonus track on the 2002 remastered version of the compilation album, The Byrds Play Dylan, and on the 2006 4-disc box set There Is a Season.49
In 1971, Nannie Parres included &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; on her album I Thought About You and in 1973 Billy Preston included the song on Everybody Likes Some Kind Of Music.50 Bettina Jonic included a cover of the song on her 1975 album The Bitter Mirror.51 Artists who have covered the song since then include Hugo Race, Terence Trent D'Arby, Mick Farren, Caetano Veloso, Marilyn Scott, and The Duhks.525354555657
Influence
Clinton Heylin, in his biography Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited, wrote that the recording &quot;opened up a whole new genre of finger-pointing song, not just for Dylan but for the entire panoply of pop.&quot; To this, Heylin adds that &quot;It's Alright, Ma&quot; probably contained more &quot;memorable aphorisms&quot; than any of Dylan's songs.58 One of these lines is &quot;he not busy being born is busy dying,&quot; from the song's second verse, which was used by Jimmy Carter in his Presidential nomination acceptance speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention.59 During his campaign for President in 2000, Al Gore told talk show host Oprah Winfrey that this was his favorite quotation.60
Another example is the line &quot;Money doesn't talk, it swears,&quot; which appears in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.61 In addition, the Columbia Dictionary of Quotations lists this as well as three other lines from the song: &quot;Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools,&quot; &quot;But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked&quot; and &quot;Everything from toy guns that spark to flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark, it's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.&quot;62 Other well-known lines include &quot;Propaganda, all is phony&quot; and &quot;Advertising signs they con you into thinking you're the one.&quot;63
In a 2005 reader's poll reported in Mojo magazine, &quot;It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; was listed as the #8 all-time greatest Bob Dylan song, and a similar poll of artists ranked the song at #21.64 In 2002, Uncut magazine listed it as the #5 all-time Dylan song.65 The song was featured in the final episode of The Sopranos.66 It has also been referenced by other songwriters. For instance, the indie-rocker Stephen Malkmus quotes &quot;It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)&quot; at the end of his song &quot;Jo-Jo's Jacket&quot; from Malkmus' debut solo album.67
