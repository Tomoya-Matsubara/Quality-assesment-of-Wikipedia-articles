Hagrid's Hut is an upcoming attraction at Islands of Adventure. The attraction will be located in the new The Wizarding World of Harry Potter section of the park upon it's opening in 2010. The attraction will be located next to the Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster, and is likely to be a walk through attraction themed to a recreation of Rubeus Hagrid's hut.
