The Great Auk, Pinguinus impennis, formerly of the genus Alca, was a large, flightless alcid that became extinct in the mid-19th century. It was the only species in the genus Pinguinus, a group of birds that included several flightless giant auks from the Atlantic Ocean region, to survive until modern times. It bred on rocky, isolated islands with easy access to both the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that only provided a few breeding sites for the auks. When not breeding, the auks spent their time foraging in the waters of the North Atlantic, ranging as far south as New England through Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.
The Great Auk was  tall and weighed around , making it the largest member of the alcid family. It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked with grooves etched into its surface. During the breeding season, the Great Auk had a white patch over each eye. After the breeding season, the auk lost this patch, instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were  long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it utilized in hunting. Its favorite prey were fish, including Atlantic menhaden and capelin, and crustaceans. Despite its agility in the water, it was clumsy on land. Its main predators were orca, White-tailed Eagles, polar bears, and humans. Great Auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown streaking. Both parents incubated for about six weeks before their young hatched. The young auks left the nest site after two or three weeks and the parents continued to care for them.
Humans had preyed upon the Great Auk for more than 100,000 years. It was an important part of many Native American cultures which coexisted with the bird, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many Maritime Archaic people were buried with Great Auk bones, including one with a cloak made of over 200 auk skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the auk as a convenient food source or as bait, reducing their numbers. The bird's down came in high demand in Europe, a demand which largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-1500s. Scientists soon began to realize that the Great Auk was disapearing and it became the benefactor of many early environmental laws. However, this did not prove to be enough. Additionally, its growing rarity increased interest in European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. This trend eliminated the last of the Great Auks on 3 July 1844 on Geirfuglasker, Iceland. However, a record of a bird in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of this species. The Great Auk is mentioned in a number of novels, while the scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honor of this bird.
Taxonomy
 The Great Auk was one of the 4400 animal species originally described by Carolus Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae, in which it was named Alca impennis.1 The species was not placed in its own genus, Pinguinus, until 1792.2 The generic name of the species is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese name for the species, while the specific name impennis is from Latin and refers to the lack of flight feathers or pennae.3
Analysis of mtDNA sequences have confirmed morphological and biogeographical studies in regarding the Razorbill as the Great Auk's closest living relative.4 The Great Auk was also closely related to the Little Auk (Dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the Razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the Great Auk was often placed in the genus Alca, including by Linnaeus. The name Alca is a Latin derivative of the Scandinavian word for Razorbills and their relatives.
However, the fossil record (especially Pinguinus alfrednewtoni from the Early Pliocene Yorktown Formation of the Lee Creek Mine, United States) and molecular evidence demonstrate that the three genera, while still closely related, diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout Xantus's Murrelet, had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. By that time the murres, or Atlantic guillemots, had apparently already split off from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the Pliocene, but the evolution of the Little Auk is sparsely documented.5 The molecular data are compatible with either view, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the Great Auk in a distinct genus.6 The Great Auk was not closely related to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, Mancalla, Praemancalla, and Alcodes.7
The Basque name for the Great Auk is arponaz while the early French name was apponatz, both meaning &quot;spearbill&quot;. The Norse called the Great Auk geirfugl, which means &quot;spearbird&quot;. This has led to an alternative common name for the bird, &quot;garefowl&quot;.8 Spanish and Portuguese sailors called the bird ping&lt;U+00FC&gt;inos, which means &quot;fat bird&quot;. The Inuit name for the Great Auk was isarukitsck, which meant &quot;little wing&quot;.9 The Welsh people referred to this species as &quot;pingwen&quot;.10 When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the Great Auk and named them after this bird, despite the fact that they are not related.11
Description
 Standing about  tall and weighing around ,12 the flightless Great Auk was both the largest of the auks and the largest member of the order Charadriiformes. The auks which lived further north averaged larger in size that the more southerly members of the species.13 Males and females were similar in plumage; however, there is evidence of differences in size, particularly in the bill and femur length.141516 The back was primarily a glossy black, while the stomach was white. The neck and legs were short, while the head and wings were small.17 The auk appeared chubby due to a thick layer of fat necessary for warmth.18 During the breeding season, the Great Auk developed a wide white eye patch over the eye.19 However, after the breeding season the auk molted and lost this eye patch, which was replaced with a wide white band and a gray line of feathers which stretched from the eye to the ear.20 The eye had a hazel or chestnut iris.21 During the summer, the auk's chin and throat were blackish brown, while the inside of the mouth was yellow.22 During the winter, this alcid molted and the throat became white.23 The bill was large at  long and curved downwards at the top.24 There were deep white grooves in both the upper and lower mandibles of the bill, up to seven on the upper mandible and twelve on the lower mandible in summer, though there were fewer in winter.2526 The wings were only  in length and the longest wing feathers were only  long.27 Its feet and short claws were black while the webbed skin between the toes was brownish black.28 The legs were far back on the bird's body which gave it powerful swimming and diving abilities.29
Hatchlings were gray and downy.30 Juvenile birds had less prominent grooves in their beaks and had mottled white and black necks.31 The eye spot in the juvenile was a gray line through the eyes to just below the ear, though they did have a white eye ring.32
The auk&lt;U+2019&gt;s calls included low croaking and a hoarse scream. A captive auk was noted to give a gurgling noise when anxious. It is not known what its other vocalizations were like, but it is believed that they were similar to those of the Razorbill, only louder and deeper.33
Distribution and habitat
 The Great Auk was found in the cold North Atlantic coastal waters along the coasts of Canada, the northeastern United States, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, Ireland, and Great Britain.34 The Great Auk left the North Atlantic waters for land only in order to breed, even roosting at sea when not breeding.3536 The rookeries of the Great Auk were found from Baffin Bay down to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, across the far northern Atlantic, including Iceland, and in Norway and the British Isles in Europe.373839 The Great Auk's nesting colonies required rocky islands with sloping shorelines to provide the birds access to the seashore.40 This was an extremely limiting factor and it is believed that the Great Auk may never have had more than 20 breeding colonies.41 Additionally, the nesting sites needed to be close to rich feeding areas and be far enough from the mainland to discourage visitation by humans and polar bears.42 Only eight breeding colonies are known: Papa Westray in the Orkney Islands, St. Kilda Island off Scotland, the Faeroe Islands between Iceland and Ireland, Gr&lt;U+00ED&gt;msey Island and Eldey Island near Iceland, Penguin Island and Funk Island near Newfoundland, and the Bird Rocks (Rochers-aux-Oiseaux) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.43 Additionally, records suggest that this species may have bred on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.44 By the late 1700s and early 1800s, the breeding range of the Great Auk was restricted to Funk Island, Grimsey Island, Eldey Island, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and St. Kilda Island.45 Funk Island was the largest known breeding colony.46
The Great Auk migrated north and south away from the breeding colonies after the chicks fledged and tended to go southward during late fall and winter.47 They were extremely common in the Grand Banks.48 Its bones have been found as far south as Florida and Gibraltar,4950 while it frequented France, Spain, and even Italy in the Mediterranean Sea.51 However, it typically did not go further south than Massachusetts Bay in the winter.52 Additionally, it has been suggested that the bones discovered in Florida may be the result of aboriginal trading.53
Ecology and behavior
Great Auks walked slowly and sometimes used their wings to help them traverse rough terrain.54 When they did run, it was awkward and with short steps in a straight line.55 They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca, and White-tailed Eagles.56 The Great Auk had no innate fear of human beings. Polar bears additionally preyed on nesting colonies of the auk.57 Their flightlessness and their awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability to human beings, who hunted them for food, feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections.58 The Great Auk reacted to noises, but was rarely scared by the sight of something.59 The auk used its bill aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans.60 These birds were believed to have had a life span of about 20 to 25 years.61
The Great Auk was generally an excellent swimmer, using its wings to propel itself underwater.62 While swimming, the head was held up but the neck was drawn in.63 These auks were capable of banking, veering, and turning underwater.64 The Great Auk was known to dive to depths of  and it has been claimed that the species was able to dive to depths of .65 It could also hold its breath for 15 minutes, longer than a seal.66 The Great Auk was capable of swimming rapidly to gather speed, then shooting out of the water and landing on a rocky ledge not level with the ocean.67
During the winter, the Great Auk migrated south either in pairs or in small groups, and never with the entire nesting colony.68
Diet
 This alcid typically fed in shoaling waters which were shallower than those frequented by other alcids.69 However, after the breeding season they had been sighted up to  from land.70 They are believed to have fed cooperatively in flocks.71 Their main food was fish, usually  in length and weighing , but occasionally their prey was up to half the bird's own length. The bird could on average dive up to  for its prey with the maximum dive depth being estimated at ; however, to conserve energy, most dives were shallower.72 Its ability to dive so deep reduced competition with other alcid species. Based on remains associated with Great Auk bones found on Funk Island and on ecological and morphological considerations, it seems that Atlantic menhaden and capelin were their favored prey.73 Other species suggested as potential prey include lumpsuckers, shorthorn sculpins, cod, and sand lance.74
The young of the Great Auk are believed to have eaten plankton and, possibly, fish and crustaceans regurgitated by adult auks.7576
Reproduction
 Great Auks began pairing in early and mid May.77 They are believed to have mated for life; however, some theorize that auks could have mated outside of their pair, a trait seen in the Razorbill.7879 Once paired, they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies, where it is likely that they copulated.8081 Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads, showing off their white eye patch, bill markings, and yellow mouth.82 These colonies were extremely crowded and dense, with some estimates stating that there was a nesting auk for every  of land.83 These colonies were very social.84 When the colonies included other species of alcid, the Great Auk was dominant due to its size.85
The Great Auk laid only one egg each year between late May and early June, though they were known to lay a replacement egg if the first one was lost.8687 In years when there was a shortage of food, the auk did not breed.88 Both parents helped create a rough nest by raking guano together in a small mound, although the species was also known to have incubated the egg on bare ground up to  from shore.8990 The eggs were pear-shaped and averaged  in length and  across at the widest point.9192 The eggs were yellowish white to light ochre with a varying pattern of black, brown or greyish spots and lines which often congregated on the large end.9394 It is believed that the variation in the egg's streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg in the colony.95 The pair took turns incubating the egg in an upright position for the 39 to 44 days before the egg hatched, typically in June, although eggs were known to be present at the colonies as late as August.9697
The parents also took turns feeding their chick. At birth, the chick was covered with grey down.98 The young bird took only two or three weeks to mature enough to abandon the nest and land for the water, typically around the middle of July.99100 The parents are known to have cared for their young after they fledged, and adults were seen swimming with their young on their back.101 The Great Auk sexually matured when they were four to seven years old.102
Relationship with humans
The Great Auk is known to have been preyed upon by Neanderthals more than 100,000 years ago, as evidenced by well-cleaned bones being found by their campfires.103 Images of the Great Auk were also carved into the walls of the El Pinto Cave in Spain over 35,000 years ago,104 while cave paintings 20,000 years old have been found in France's Grotte Cosquer.105
Native Americans who coexisted with the Great Auk valued it as a food source during the winter and as an important symbol. Images of the Great Auk have been found in bone necklaces.106 A person buried at the Maritime Archaic site at Port au Choix, Newfoundland, dating to about 2000 BC, seems to have been interred clothed in a suit made from more than 200 Great Auk skins, with the heads left attached as decoration.107 Nearly half of the bird bones found in graves at this site were of the Great Auk, suggesting that it had cultural significance for the Maritime Archaic people.108 The extinct Beothuks of Newfoundland made pudding out of the auk's eggs.109 The Dorset Eskimos also hunted the species, while the Saqqaq in Greenland overhunted the species, causing a range reduction locally.110
Later, European sailors utilized the auks as a navigational beacon, as it was known that the presence of these birds signaled that the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were near.111
Extinction
 This species is estimated to have had a maximum population in the millions, although some scientists dispute this estimation.112 The Great Auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the 8th century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives can be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America,113 as well as from early 5th century Labrador where the bird seems to have occurred only as a straggler.114 Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island, were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore used this species as both a convenient food source and bait.115 Some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of these auks onto the ships, where they were then slaughtered.116 However, some authors have questioned whether this hunting method actually occurred successfully.117 Great Auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were three times the size of a murre and had a large yolk.118 These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands.119
The Little Ice Age may have reduced the population of the Great Auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation for their down drastically reduced the population.120 By the mid-1500s, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows.121 In 1553, the auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 London banned the killing of this species for its feathers.122 In St. John's, individuals violating a 1775 law banning hunting the Great Auk for its feathers or eggs were publically flogged, though hunting for use as bait was still permitted.123 On the North American side, eider down was initially preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the auk at the same time that hunting for food, bait, and oil decreased.124125 Specimens of the Great Auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, and the loss of a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites of the Great Auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected eggs without embryos growing inside of them and typically discarded the eggs with embryos.126
It was on the islet of Stac an Armin, St Kilda, Scotland, in July 1840, that the last Great Auk seen in the British Isles was caught and killed.127 A then 75-year-old inhabitant of St Kilda told Henry Evans, a frequent visitor to the archipelago, that he and his father-in-law with another man had caught a &quot;garefowl&quot;, noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head. They tied it up and kept it alive for three days, and then killed it by beating it with a stick, apparently because they believed it to be a witch.128129
The last colony of Great Auks lived on Geirfuglasker (the &quot;Great Auk Rock&quot;) off Iceland. This islet was a volcanic rock surrounded by cliffs which made it inaccessible to humans, but in 1830 the islet submerged, and the birds moved to the nearby island of Eldey, which was accessible from a single side. When the colony was initially discovered in 1835, nearly fifty birds were present. Museums, desiring the skins of the auk for preservation and display, quickly began collecting birds from the colony.130 The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on 3 July 1844, with J&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Brandsson and Sigur&lt;U+00F0&gt;ur &lt;U+00CD&gt;sleifsson strangling the adults and Ketill Ketilsson smashing the egg with his boot.131 However, a later claim of a live individual sighted in 1852 on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland has been accepted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).132
Today, around 75 eggs of the Great Auk remain in museum collections, along with 24 complete skeletons and 81 mounted skins. While thousands of isolated bones have been collected from 19th century Funk Island to Neolithic middens, only a small number of complete skeletons exist.133 Following the bird's extinction, the price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year.134
Cultural depictions

The Great Auk is one of the more frequently-referenced extinct birds in literature. It appears in many works of children's literature, including Charles Kingsley's The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby and Enid Blyton's The Island of Adventure.135136 Both works deal with the bird's extinction, with the first novel depicting an auk telling the tale of its species extinction and the latter novel sending the protagonist on a failed search for what he believes is a lost colony of the species. The Great Auk is also present in a wide variety of other works of fiction. In his novel Ulysses, James Joyce mentions the bird while the novel's main character is drifting into sleep. He associates the Great Auk with the mythical roc bird as a method of formally returning the main character to a sleepy land of fantasy and memory.137 Penguin Island, a 1908 French satirical novel by the Nobel Prize winning author Anatole France, narrates the fictional history of a Great Auk population that is mistakenly baptized by a nearsighted missionary.138 A Great Auk is collected by fictional naturalist Stephen Maturin in the Patrick O'Brian historical novel The Surgeon's Mate. This work also details the harvesting of a colony of auks.139 The Great Auk is the subject of a novel, The Last Great Auk by Allen Eckert, which tells of the events leading to the extinction of the Great Auk as seen from the perspective of the last one alive. The bird also appears in Farley Mowat's Sea of Slaughter.140 It is also the subject of a ballet, Still Life at the Penguin Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt;,141 and a song in the ecological musical Rockford's Rock Opera.142
The Great Auk is the mascot of the Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware, Sir Sandford Fleming College in Ontario, and the Adelaide University Choral Society (AUCS) in Australia.143144145 It is also the mascot of the Knowledge Masters educational competition.146 The scientific journal of the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honor of this bird.147 According to Homer Hickam's memoir, Rocket Boys, and its movie production, October Sky, the early rockets he and his friends built were ironically named &quot;Auk&quot;.148 Even a cigarette company, the British Great Auk Cigarettes, was named after this bird.149 Walton Ford, the American painter, has featured Great Auks in two paintings: 'The Witch of St. Kilda' and 'Funk Island'.150 The Great Auk also appeared on one stamp in a set of five depicting extinct birds issued by Cuba in 1974.151
