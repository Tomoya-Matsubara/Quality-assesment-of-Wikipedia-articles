Samuel McDowell (October 29, 1735 – September 25, 1817) was a soldier and early political leader in Kentucky. He was the father of Dr. Ephraim McDowell.
McDowell participated in three major wars. He served under George Washington in the French and Indian War, served as an aide-de-camp to Isaac Shelby in Lord Dunmore's War, and was part of Nathanael Greene's campaign in the Revolutionary War. Following the Revolutionary War, he relocated to Kentucky and became a surveyor. Later, he was appointed one of the first district court judges in what would become the state of Kentucky. He became a leader of the movement to separate Kentucky from Virginia, presiding over nine of the state's ten constitutional conventions.

In 1773, McDowell represented Augusta County, Virginia in the Virginia House of Burgesses.19 He was a delegate to a March 20, 1775 conference in Richmond, Virginia to make preparation for the Revolutionary War.20 At this conference, he and Thomas Lewis were chosen to carry a letter to several delegates to the upcoming Second Continental Congress, thanking them for their actions.21 McDowell and Lewis both served in the Virginia Conventions in 1775 and 1776.22 McDowell also attended a second conference in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1776 where he declared the rights of man and instructed the Continental Congress to declare the colonies' independence.23
At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, McDowell was commissioned a colonel over a regiment from Augusta County.24 He participated in the Battle of Guilford Courthouse while serving under General Nathanael Greene.25 His son John also participated in this battle.26 The elder McDowell was present at Charles Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown.27
