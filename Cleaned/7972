Course
The river begins at Partridge Lake, adjacent to the much larger Kesagami Lake on the Kesagami River, part of Harricana River drainage basin. It exits the lake at the east and turns north, then jogs west through the Kanatotik Rapids before again heading north and passing around Blackbear Island. It continues north around Kaskagonagau Island and Mistikopileo Island, takes in the right tributary Little Partridge River, and reaches its mouth at James Bay.
