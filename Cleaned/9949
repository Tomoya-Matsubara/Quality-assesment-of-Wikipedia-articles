Londonthorpe is a satellite village of Grantham, in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. The village is in the civil parish of Londonthorpe and Harrowby Without. It lies  to the north-east from Grantham,  to the west from the B6403 (Ermine Street Roman road), and borders on Belton Park in the west.
The Londonthorpe name may derive from the Old Scandinavian lundr+thorp; in the Domesday account the village was written as &quot;Lundertorp&quot;.123
The parish is centred around Grade II listed Harrowby Hall,45 Londonthorpe previously being an estate village of Harrowby Estate. The village listed buildings include The Grange farm house,6 the Manor House,7 and various other houses and cottages.8 Listed buildings within the larger Londonthorpe and Harrowby parish include the Officer's Mess of the WWII RAF Spitalgate, and buildings and structures within Belton Park.9
The parish church is dedicated to St John Baptist, the tower of which dates back to the early 13th century, and parts of the rood screen from the 15th century. The church was rebuilt with a new roof in 1850, with considerable further restoration taking place in 1879.101112 Earthworks of unknown origin lie to the west of the church13  Londonthorpe Wood, created in 1993 by the Woodland Trust, is within the parish  to the west.14 The parish also includes Prince William of Gloucester Barracks (previously RAF Spitalgate) and parts of eastern Grantham, particularly Alma Park Industrial Estate.15
During the 1930s the parish was a centre for the Land Settlement Association scheme, a social experiment where unemployed Durham miners were offered specially built cottages with smallholdings of land and livestock, to encourage self-sufficiency.1617
