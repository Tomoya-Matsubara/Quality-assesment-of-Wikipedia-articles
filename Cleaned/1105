Achille-Louis Foville (1799 - June 22, 1878) was a French Neurologist and Psychiatrist. He produced the first description of the Terminal stria.1
Foville was born in Pontoise, France and receivedhis medical doctorate in 1824, after studying medicine under L&lt;U+00E9&gt;on Louis Rostan and Jean &lt;U+00C9&gt;tienne Dominique Esquirol at Piti&lt;U+00E9&gt;-Salp&lt;U+00EA&gt;tri&lt;U+00E8&gt;re Hospital. His medical thesis argued mental illness may be curable, discussing some treatments of the day and their apparent effectiveness.2 The next year, he was made the medical superintendent of the Saint-Yon asylum in Rouen. He published several papers on disorders of the nervous system which were well received. His son Achille-Louis-Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Foville was born in 1831.3 He remained at the asylum until 1833, when ill health forced his resignation.4
Foville spent time travellin abroad, to Africa and America. He returned to France, settling in Paris. After the death of his former teacher Esquirol in 1840, Foville was made a professor at Charenton. Until the appointment Thomas Hodgkin had been attempting to open a facility for the treatment of mental illnesses to compete with the York Retreat. With Foville's appointment to Charenton, Fhe was no longer willing to relocate to England, and Hodgekins dropped the project, feeling no other doctors were suitable to run the facility.5 In 1844 he published Trait&lt;U+00E9&gt; complet de l'anatomie, de la physiologie et de la pathologie du syst&lt;U+00E8&gt;me nerveux c&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;bro-spinal on the anatomy of the nervous system of the spinal chord, regarded as one of the best works on the subject prior to the invention of the microscope.6 The French Revolution of 1848 cost him his job at the asylum, and Foville took up private practice in Paris. He practised medicine in Paris, treating mental disorders, until 1868, when he retired. He moved to Toulouse after his retirement, where he died in 1878.7
