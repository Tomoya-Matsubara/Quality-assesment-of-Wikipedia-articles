Juan S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez Pel&lt;U+00E1&gt;ez (1922&lt;U+2013&gt;2003) was a Venezuelan poet and National Prize winner for Literature in 1975. He was born on September 25, 1922 in Altagracia de Orituco, state of Gu&lt;U+00E1&gt;rico, and died on November 20, 2003 in Caracas.1
Education and career
Juan S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez Pel&lt;U+00E1&gt;ez was born in Altagracia de Orituco but his family soon moved to Caracas, where he attended primary and secondary schools. He attended university in Santiago, Chile where he befriended the poets of the surrealist group Mandr&lt;U+00E1&gt;gora. He published his first poems in their magazine and it was through this encounter that his lifelong interest in surrealism began. Upon returning to Caracas, he published Elena y los elementos in 1951. Elena y los elementos had a profound effect on Venezuelan poetry, outlining a distinctly Venezuelan form of surrealism that influenced the generation of avant-garde poets who emerged in the 1960s. This book was published in a fiftieth anniversary edition by Monte &lt;U+00C1&gt;vila Editores after he was awarded the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the Universidad de los Andes in M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida in 2001.2
He worked as a teacher in Matur&lt;U+00ED&gt;n, Maracaibo and the state of Sucre. He was cultural attache to the Embassy of Venezuela in Colombia. He also lived in Paris3 and Madrid.4 In 1969 he was a Fellow at The University of Iowa&lt;U+2019&gt;s International Writing Program, after which he lived in New York City for two years. S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez Pel&lt;U+00E1&gt;ez was a contributor to numerous periodicals: Papel Literario (El Nacional), Zona Franca, Eco (Colombia) Revista Poesia (Valencia), Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;al (Paris), Tabla Redonda, among others.
The outstanding feature of his poetry is the tension between mysticism and eroticism.5 S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez Pel&lt;U+00E1&gt;ez always looked at his erotic objects as distant entities, separate from the mundane through the metaphysical veil. Ludovico Silva, in his &quot;Juan Sanchez Pelaez, The real and illusionary&quot; states:
Juan S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez Pel&lt;U+00E1&gt;ez was the first Venezuelan poet who introduced into our poetry, consciousness of the secrecy of man in the world and his distressing certainty of being thrown into time as a foreigner, without his consent (...) His existential rebellion is a discerning attitude, a lyrical excitement, a ritual of introspection. Silent. He accepts the world but does not understand it and his flexible language, capable of expressing nuances of a visionary and deeply artistic sensibility, constitutes a renewal.6
Juan Liscano, in his Panorama de la Literatura actual (Overview of Current Literature), 1973, states: &quot;S&lt;U+00E1&gt;nchez Pel&lt;U+00E1&gt;ez through his open writing and his existential attitude created a new path in our poetry&quot;.
