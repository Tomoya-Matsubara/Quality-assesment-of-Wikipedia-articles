Stigand (died 1072) was an English churchman of pre-Conquest England. He served as archbishop of Canterbury, bishop of Winchester and was twice bishop of Elmham. Stigand acted as an adviser to several members of both the Anglo-Saxon and Norman lines of English royalty.
Five successive popes, including Pope Nicholas II and Pope Alexander II, all excommunicated Stigand for holding both the see of Winchester and the see of Canterbury at the same time. Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror and assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066. In 1070 he was deposed by the papal legate and was imprisoned at Winchester. At the time of the death of Edward the Confessor, only the royal estates and the estates of Harold had been larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand.
Early life
Stigand first appears in the historical record in 1020 when, as a royal chaplain to Canute, he was appointed to the church that Canute built at Ashingdon to honor the souls of those killed in Canute's coming to power in 1016.12 After Canute's death he served Canute's son, Harold Harefoot. His name was Norwegian and he was born in East Anglia, possibly born a native of Norwich.3 He was definitely of mixed English and Scandanavian stock.4 After the death of Harthacanute, Stigand appears to have acted as the chief adviser of Canute's widow, Emma of Normandy mother of both Harthacanute and Edward the Confessor.5
Bishop of Elmham and Winchester
 Shortly after Edward the Confessor's coronation, Stigand was appointed to the see of Elmham, almost assuredly on Emma's advice.6 Elmham was the diocese that covered East Anglia. On April 3 10437 he was consecrated bishop.8 Edward, however, deposed Stigand in late 1043 and deprived him of his wealth. The deposition was short lived, as Edward returned Stigand to the episcopal chair by 1044.9 The reasons for the deposition are unknown, but it was probably connected to the similar fall from grace of the king's mother Emma that occurred at the same time. Rumors of the time included one that had Emma and Stigand having an affair, which led to both of them being deprived of the king's favor.10
In 1047 he was translated to the see of Winchester.1112 He retained at Elmham, however, until 1052.13 Some have held that he supported Earl Godwin of Wessex in his quarrel with Edward the Confessor,14 others hold that he was neutral.15 Whatever the case, in 1052 there was arranged a peace between the earl and the king.16
Archbishop of Canterbury
In 1052 the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert of Jumieges, was outlawed and driven from England. Stigand was then appointed to the archbishopric.17 This was either a reward from Godwin, for siding with Godwin's family in the crisis of 1051–1052, or one from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the situation in 1052 when Godwin returned.18 Pope Leo IX and his two successors refused to recognize him, regarding Robert as the rightful archbishop. Stigand released Elmham to his brother &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelmaer, but retained the bishopric of Winchester at the same time he was archbishop.19 He was the first non-monk to be named to either the Archbishopric of Canterbury or of York since before the days of Dunstan.20 He was later accused of simony, or the buying of ecclesiastical office, but all such accusations date to after 1066, and are thus suspect due to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Stigand and the English Church as corrupt and backward.21 Stigand may have been behind the effort to locate Edward the Atheling and his brother Edmund after 1052, possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward.22
Excommunicated
 In 1058, however, Benedict X gave him the pall,23 but this pope was deposed in the following year. At this time, there was a growing movement in the church to reform itself and, being a pluralist, or the holding of more than one benefice at the same time, came under scrutiny. Since Stigand retained Winchester, he was definitely a pluralist, which Pope Nicholas II had in 1061 declared to be uncannoical unless approved by the pope, when he declared the Aldred of Worcester must give up Worcester in order to be consecrated Archbishop of York.24 Five successive popes (Pope Leo IX, Pope Victor II, Pope Stephen IX, Pope Nicholas II and Pope Alexander II)25 excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. Not only did Stigand hold Winchester along with Canterbury, but he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps others.26 His position was such that even bishops in England were leery of being consecrated by him.27 Both Giso of Wells and Walter of Hereford travelled to Rome to be consecrated by the Pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand.28 The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.29 During the brief period that he held a pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate Aethelric of Selsey and Siward of Rochester.30
Due to Stigand's issues with the papacy, the diocese of York was able to encroach on the suffragan bishops normally subject to Canterbury. York had long been held in common with Worcester, but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated, the see of York also claimed Lichfield and Dorcester as part of its archiepiscopal diocese.31 In 1062, however, papal legates of Alexander II came to England. They did not depose Stigand, and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop.32 He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the business of the council.33
Final years and legacy
 Stigand is said by Norman writers to have crowned King Harold II in January of 106634 and is depicted at that coronation in the Bayeux tapestry, but current historical research has shown that this ceremony was performed by Aldred, Archbishop of York due to the controversy about Stigand's position.353637 Stigand did support Harold and was present at Edward the Confessor's deathbed.38 The English sources claim that Aldred crowned Harold, while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so, with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as unlawful.39
After the death of Harold, Stigand worked with Earl Edwin and Earl Morcar, as well as Archbishop Aldred of York, to put Edgar Atheling on the throne.40 This plan did not come to fruition, however, as the northern earls and some of the other bishops were against it.41 Stigand submitted to William at Wallingford in early December of 1066,42 and assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066.43 William took Stigand in his train to Normandy in 1067.44 After the first rebellions broke out, William adopted a policy of conciliating the church and gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Aldred of York and Aethelwig, abbot of Evesham.45 Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand.46 At a Council held at Winchester at Easter,47 the bishops met with papal legates from Alexander II.48 On April 11 1070 he was deposed49 by the papal legate, Ermenfrid, bishop of Sion50 and was imprisoned at Winchester. Deposed along with him were his brother Aethelmaer bishop of Elmham, Aethelric bishop of Selsey, Ethelwin bishop of Durham and Leofwine bishop of Lichfield, who was married.5152 There were three reasons for Stigand's deposition: that had held the bishopric of Winchester in plurarity with Canterbury, that he had not only occupied Canterbury after Robert of Jumi&lt;U+00E8&gt;ges fled but had also seized Robert's pallium which had been left behind and that he had received his own pallium from Benedict X.53
Stigand died in 1072 and his death was commemorated on February 22 or February 21.54 He was probably buried in the Old Minster at Westminster.55 At King Edward's death, only the royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand.56 He had been an avaricious man and a great pluralist, holding the bishopric of Winchester after he became archbishop of Canterbury, in addition to several abbeys.57
