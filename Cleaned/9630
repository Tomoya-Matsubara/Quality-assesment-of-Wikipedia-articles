  The 4th Canadian Parliament was in session from February 13, 1879 until May 18, 1882. The membership was set by the 1878 federal election on September 17, 1878, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1882 election.
It was controlled by a Conservative/Liberal-Conservative majority under Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald. The Official Opposition was the Liberal Party, first led by Alexander Mackenzie, and then by Edward Blake.
The Speaker was Joseph God&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric Blanchet. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1873-1882 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.
