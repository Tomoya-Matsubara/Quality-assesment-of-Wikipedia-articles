Biography
Marina Keegan was born in Boston and raised in the suburb of Wayland, Massachusetts. She attended Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols before matriculating to Yale University in the autumn of 2008.4 At Yale, Keegan majored in English and served as president of the Yale College Democrats during her junior year.5 She was to begin a job at The New Yorker following her graduation from Yale;6 however, she tragically died in a car crash on Cape Cod, only five days after the ceremony.7
The Opposite of Loneliness
A collection of Keegan's works, both fiction and non-fiction, was published posthumously by Scribner on April 8, 2014.8. The book is named after her famous graduation essay and features an introduction by the best-selling American author Anne Fadiman, who was one of Keegan's professors at Yale. &quot;The Opposite of Loneliness&quot; was released to critical acclaim and quickly became a New York Times bestseller. The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof dedicated a column to the book, hailing it &lt;U+2018&gt;a triumph&lt;U+2019&gt; and urging readers to reflect on what they really want from life.9 Positive reviews of the text have been garnered from the Chicago Tribune,10 The Boston Globe,11 and the Financial Times,12 among many others.
Other notable works
'Even Artichokes have Doubts'
In September, 2011, Keegan published an essay in the Yale Daily News entitled &lt;U+2018&gt;Even artichokes have doubts&lt;U+2019&gt;, lamenting the high percentage of graduates who enter into the fields of finance and consulting.13 The piece captured the attention of author Kevin Roose, who worked for the New York Times&lt;U+2019&gt; financial website DealBook at the time. Roose contacted Keegan and asked her to adapt her essay for DealBook, which published her piece as &lt;U+2018&gt;Another View: The Science and Strategy of College Recruiting&lt;U+2019&gt; on November 9, 2011.14 Roose reports that it was DealBook&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+2018&gt;best-performing post in months&lt;U+2019&gt;.15 He went on to feature Keegan in his book Young Money: Inside the Hidden World of Wall Street&lt;U+2019&gt;s Post-Crash Recruits (2014), and dedicated it to her memory. Keegan also appeared on National Public Radio's 'All Things Considered' to discuss the piece.16
