Irresistible is a song by American recording artist Jessica Simpson that Sony Music Entertainment Sony Music released on April 12, 2001, as the lead single from her second studio album Irresistible Jessica Simpson album of the same name. Its title and concept were proposed by singer-songwriter Pamela Sheyne, while Arnthor Birgisson, an acquaintance of Sony chief executive officer Tommy Mottola, and his partner Anders Bagge developed the melody and co-wrote the verses with Sheyne. The lyrics are more sexually suggestive than Simpson's previous songs.
The song, composed in the Key music key of C major, is a mid-tempo Contemporary R&B R&B number with dance-pop and funk influences. Instruments featured in the song include strings, synthesizers, percussion, and acoustic piano. The lyrics center on the tension between a young woman's sexual desires and her inhibitions. A So So Def remix of the piece features Bow Wow rapper Lil' Bow Wow and Jermaine Dupri, and incorporates samples of Kool & the Gang's Jungle Boogie 1973.
The accompanying music video, directed by Simon Brand, has a James Bond theme and features scenes of Simpson dressed as a spy. A music video for the So So Def remix was also filmed, featuring appearances by Dupri and Lil' Bow Wow inter-cut with scenes of Simpson. She performed the song as part of the set list of her DreamChaser Tour 2001 and Reality Tour Jessica Simpson tour Reality Tour 2004. The single was also promoted with live performances on various televised appearances and the MTV Total Request Live Tour 2001.  Irresistible was featured on the List of Disney Channel Original Series Disney Channel Original Series Lizzie McGuire soundtrack Lizzie McGuire 2001.
Critics gave Irresistible mostly negative reviews noting the similarity to Pink singer Pink's There You Go 2000. Although a few praised the song for its theme and  production, most criticized Simpson's singing style, the sexual nature of the song's lyrics, and the over-use of digital sound enhancers. The song reached number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and number fifteen on the United States Billboard Hot 100 Billboard Hot 100, while peaking within the top twenty in nine other countries. Despite not charting within the top twenty in Australia, it was certified List of music recording certifications gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA for shipments of more than 35,000 copies within the country. The song ranked on the Billboard Hot 100 and Australian year-end charts at numbers sixty-three and fifty, respectively.

In an interview, Birgisson commented on the collaboration with Sheyne saying that:
Pam came up with the title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking about the whole concept we immediately became inspired and began working on the music. You know, when we hear a concept or a title that we likeno matter if it's ours or somebody else'sboth Anders and I get a feel for the song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately came up with the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she came up with the lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done.

He also noticed that the breakdown and spoken passages of the song gave it a street edge, something not previously heard from Simpson. Teresa Gubbins of The Dallas Morning News had mixed feelings towards the song in her review, writing that its sound might help Simpson get attention on urban radios, but did nothing to demonstrate her voice. Larry Printz of The Morning Call also expressed a similar view of the song, stating that the song is loaded with platitudes, but it's easy on the ears.cite news url =http://articles.mcall.com/2001-06-30/news/3351524_1_mandy-moore-krystal-bad-idea title =Jessica Simpson: Irresistible Columbia Mandy Moore Epic Krystal: Me & My Piano Geffen last =Printz first =Larry newspaper =The Morning Call publisher =Tribune Company date =2001-06-30 archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wypJOVoa archivedate =2011-03-06 accessdate =2011-03-06
