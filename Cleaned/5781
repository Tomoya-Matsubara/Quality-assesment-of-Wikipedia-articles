The Will to Live (1997), an album by Ben Harper which showed his continuing folk-centric focus, while at the same time expanding on his rock talents. This was the second album with the Innocent Criminals (uncredited), and was packaged with a special bonus CD in certain countries.
The record would yield his first UK Top 75 single, &quot;Faded&quot;. To date it remains his only UK single entry.
