&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is a song by George Harrison, released in 1970 as the title track to his triple album of the same name. Billy Preston originally released the song on his Apple album Encouraging Words after The Beatles rejected it in 1969 for their then forthcoming Let It Be album. The music of The Band influenced the song as Harrison spent time with the group in late 1968 following the completion of The Beatles' White Album. Timothy Leary's poem, &quot;All Things Pass&quot;, a psychedelic adaptation of the Tao Te Ching, provided inspiration for the song.
Music critics classify &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as one of Harrison's finest compositions. The rejection of the song by Harrison's former band led critics to describe it as &quot;the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles&quot;.1 Interpreted as a statement on the band's break-up upon its release, the subject matter deals with the transient nature of human existence. Writers frequently quoted the lyrics following Harrison's death in November 2001. Cover versions include recordings by artists Jim James, Sloan Wainwright, Yusuf Islam and Paul McCartney.
Background and composition
Like his friend Eric Clapton, George Harrison was inspired by Music from Big Pink, the &quot;monumental&quot; debut album2 from The Band, the former backing group for Bob Dylan.34 Released in July 1968, Music from Big Pink was partly responsible for Harrison's return to the guitar, his first instrument,5 after he spent two years attempting to master the more complex Indian sitar.67 Harrison duly shared his enthusiasm with the British music press, declaring Big Pink &quot;the new sound to come from America&quot;, drummer Levon Helm later recalled, thus helping to establish The Band internationally.8 In appreciation, their guitarist, Robbie Robertson, extended an invitation to him to stop by in Woodstock, New York, when the opportunity arose.9
Late in 1968, after producing sessions in Los Angeles for Apple signing Jackie Lomax's Is This What You Want? album,10 Harrison spent Thanksgiving and much of December in upstate New York,11 where he renewed his friendship with a now semi-retired Dylan and took part in a series of informal jam sessions with The Band.1213 According to Helm, they discussed plans for a possible &quot;fireside jam&quot; album with Clapton and an Apple Films &quot;rock western&quot; called Zachariah, but neither project ever occurred.14 Nevertheless, the period was fruitful, producing the Harrison&lt;U+2212&gt;Dylan composition &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot; and &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, which Harrison later described as a &quot;Robbie Robertson&lt;U+2212&gt;Band type of tune&quot;.15
Lyrically, the song drew inspiration from &quot;All Things Pass&quot;, a poem published in Timothy Leary's 1966 book Psychedelic Prayers after the Tao Te Ching.1617 In Harrison's autobiography, Harrison refers to the idea for the song originating from &quot;all kinds of mystics and ex-mystics&quot;, including Leary.18 Like a number of Harrison songs (for example, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, &quot;So Sad&quot; and &quot;Blow Away&quot;), metaphors involving the weather and the cycle of nature inform the lyrical and emotional content of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.19
Musically, the verses are set to a logical climb within the key of E major;20 the brief choruses form a departure from this, with their inclusion of a B minor chord rather than the more expected major voicing &lt;U+2212&gt; an example of the same &quot;modes, cadences and suspensions&quot; found in Band songs such as &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, Harrison biographer Ian Inglis notes.21
Simon Leng, author of the first musical biography on George Harrison, has written of the lyrics reflecting &quot;life's ephemeral character&quot; and the &quot;transitory&quot; nature of love;22 to Inglis, the song is &quot;[o]stensibly&quot; about &quot;the end of a love affair&quot;.23 A number of writers note the optimism offered in Harrison's words,2425 since, as Leng puts it, &quot;a new day always dawns.&quot;26
Although &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; avoids religiosity, theologian Dale Allison observes that its statement on the &quot;all-inclusive&quot; transience of things in the material world explains why so much of its parent album &quot;finds hope and meaning only in God, who does not pass away&quot;.27 The song's main message is offered in its middle eight:2829
Ultimately, the cycle of nature offers &quot;consolation&quot;, Leng opines,30 as further evidenced in the verse-three lines &quot;Now the darkness only stays at night time ... Daylight is good at arriving at the right time&quot;.31
Before Harrison came to record the song for All Things Must Pass, the lyrics underwent some minor changes, once he presented it to the other Beatles, then gathered at Twickenham Film Studios for the so-called Get Back project, in January 1969.32 Verse two's second line was initially written as the more literal &quot;A wind can blow those clouds away&quot;,33 but bootlegs from the sessions reveal John Lennon suggesting the word &quot;mind&quot;, to introduce a bit of &quot;psychedelia&quot; into the song.34 Similarly, the repeated line &quot;it's not always gonna be this grey&quot; was originally &quot;It's not always been this grey&quot; in verses one and two, a change of perspective that Harrison made before Billy Preston came to record the song early the following year.35
Pre-All Things Must Pass recording history
The Beatles' version
After being treated with respect as an &quot;artist&quot; in Los Angeles music circles and an equal among the likes of Bob Dylan and The Band, Harrison returned to the Beatles fold and found the same discordant atmosphere that had blighted the lengthy sessions for their 1968 double album.363738 &quot;[S]traight away, again, it was just weird vibes,&quot; Harrison later recalled. &quot;You know, I was starting to enjoy being a musician, but the moment I got back with the Beatles it was just too difficult.&quot;39 Early on in the Get Back sessions &lt;U+2212&gt; and tellingly, music journalist John Harris notes, before the arrival that day of Lennon and his ever-present partner Yoko Ono &lt;U+2212&gt; Harrison enthused with fellow Beatles Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney about The Band's group ethos: &quot;They're just living, and they happen to be a band as well.&quot;40John Harris, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, Mojo, December 2003, p. 92. Helm's &quot;whiskers&quot; received special mention and the fact that, in contrast to the atmosphere within The Beatles, he had &quot;a happy, smiling face&quot;.4142
On 2 January, day one of the Twickenham film shoot, Harrison introduced &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, and the band worked on the song intermittently over the next four days of filming;4344 they returned to it briefly towards the end of the month, by which time the project had moved location to Apple's basement studio45 &lt;U+2212&gt; one of Harrison's conditions for rejoining The Beatles after his temporary walkout on 10 January.4647 In the search for a suitable musical arrangement for &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, Harrison stressed his preference for a &quot;feel&quot; akin to The Band, a suggestion that resulted in Lennon switching from guitar to Lowrey organ (a keyboard favoured by The Band's Garth Hudson).48 Although a fair amount of time was dedicated to the song,49 it was ultimately pushed aside, just as other Harrison compositions including &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;, &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, &quot;Let It Down&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; received a lukewarm reception,50 particularly from Lennon.51525354 David Fricke of Rolling Stone has referred to this period as a &quot;struggle&quot; for Harrison &quot;against the patronizing restrictions of writing within and for the Beatles&quot;,55 while Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt, authors of Get Back: The Unauthorized Chronicle of The Beatles' Let It Be Disaster, observe that Harrison's songs were routinely rejected by Lennon and McCartney &quot;even though some were far better than their own&quot;.56
The Beatles never formally recorded &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;57 although at least one rehearsal take exists featuring the full group.5859 The Fly on the Wall bonus disc accompanying the McCartney-instigated Let It Be... Naked album in 2003 includes a snippet of The Beatles indulging in Band-like chorusing on the song.60
Harrison's solo demo
Also on the Get Back bootlegs, Harrison can be heard having a conversation with Lennon and Ono about possibly doing a solo album of his unused songs, in order to &quot;preserve this, the Beatle bit, more&quot;.61 Lennon appears to support the idea62 &lt;U+2212&gt; perhaps, author Bruce Spizer has suggested, to &quot;spare&quot; The Beatles from having to record Harrison's songs.63 While no such album would eventuate until after the band's break-up, on 25 February 1969 (his twenty-sixth birthday), Harrison entered Abbey Road Studios alone and recorded a demo of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, along with other recent compositions &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot; and &quot;Something&quot;.6465 With Ken Scott serving as engineer,66 he recorded two takes of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, adding extra electric guitar onto the second.6768 This version was eventually released in 1996 on the Beatles collection Anthology 3.69
Billy Preston&lt;U+2019&gt;s version
Although Harrison began talking publicly about the idea of a solo album during the final months of 1969,70 he offered &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; to Billy Preston for his 1970 album Encouraging Words.7172 After the Get Back/Let It Be sessions relocated to their own Apple Studio in central London, Harrison invited Preston to play keyboards for The Beatles.737475 The 22-year-old Texan impressed the participants with his superior musicianship and convivial presence,7677 resulting in a recording contract with Apple Records.78 Encouraging Words became the second (and last) album under the contract.7980 Co-produced by Harrison, Preston's reading of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; betrays an obvious debt to his former mentor Ray Charles.81 Music critics consider Preston's version superior to Harrison's &quot;definitive&quot; version of the song released a few months later.8283
All Things Must Pass recording
Despite having given &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; to Billy Preston for his forthcoming album (released in September 1970),84 Harrison chose to record it himself for what would turn out to be the title song of his post-Beatle &quot;masterpiece&quot;, All Things Must Pass.85 The basic track was taped early in June, judging by the appearance of Pete Drake on the session;86 other participants included Clapton and Starr, the latter another avowed Band fan.87 Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley describes &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as a &quot;haunting hymn about the mortality of everything&quot; and notes the added poignance in Harrison's version, due to the death of his mother in July 1970 after a long period of illness.88
The recording opens with Bobby Whitlock's &quot;unvaryingly steady&quot; piano chords89 and &quot;sensitive&quot; string orchestration from John Barham,90 soon joined by Jim Price-arranged horns and Drake's country pedal steel guitar.91 This combination received praise for providing the song with its rising and falling musical moods, implying variously light and darkness,92 mirroring the &quot;competing impressions&quot; of hope and melancholy found in Harrison's lyrics.93 Compared to the earlier readings, this version of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; has &quot;a stateliness that avoids lugubriousness&quot;, in the words of Allmusic's Richie Unterberger.94 True to its Catskill roots, the song evokes The Band and their classic &quot;The Weight&quot;,9596 as well as their eponymous second album,97 the tracks on which were inspired, like &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, by &quot;the beauty of that autumn in Woodstock&quot;.98 Leng finds the strongest similarities between Harrison's songs from this period and Robbie Robertson's in the latter's &quot;The Unfaithful Servant&quot;, the &quot;sweet-and-sour&quot; horn arrangement from which Harrison &quot;recycled&quot; on &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.99
Erratic attendance by co-producer Phil Spector during the All Things Must Pass sessions left Harrison to handle most of the project alone.100101102John Bergstrom, &quot;George Harrison: All Things Must Pass&quot;, PopMatters, 14 January 2011 (retrieved 28 April 2012) After receiving a tape of early mixes of many of the songs, Spector eventually provided Harrison with written feedback and guidance.103 In contrast to the views of Lennon and McCartney the previous year,104 Spector told Harrison: &quot;This particular song is so good that any honest performance by you is acceptable as far as I'm concerned ...&quot;105106 Spector expressed his disapproval of the horns at the start of the track,107 but, as authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter have noted, &quot;clearer heads prevailed&quot; and Price and Bobby Keys' contributions were retained.108
Release and reception
Almost two years after Harrison originally wrote the song, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was released in November 1970, closing side three of the triple album in its original LP format.109 The song received critical acclaim upon its release. Acknowledging the extended recording history of the song, Madinger and Easter write that &quot;[the] wait was well worth it&quot; for this &quot;fine&quot; composition.110 Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner noted in 1977, with reference to Harrison's commercial and critical dominance over his former bandmates following the break-up: &quot;The very fact that the Beatles had kept George's flowering talents so under wraps proved to be his secret weapon.&quot;111 Schaffner named &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; as &quot;[the] two most eloquent songs on the album, musically as well as lyrically&quot; with &quot;mysterious, seductive melodies, over which faded strings and horns hover like Blue Jay Way fog&quot;.112 The song's title was invariably seen as Harrison's statement on the demise of the band.113114115
On release, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as &quot;eloquently hopeful and resigned&quot; while labelling the album &quot;the music of mountain tops and vast horizons&quot;.116Ben Gerson, &quot;Reviews: George Harrison All Things Must Pass&quot;, Rolling Stone, 21 January 1971 (retrieved 3 July 2012). Writing for the same publication thirty years later, Anthony DeCurtis praised the song for its musical demonstration of &lt;U+201C&gt;the sweet satisfactions of faith&lt;U+201D&gt;.117 In his book on Harrison, subtitled A Spiritual Biography, Gary Tillery refers to the song as &quot;magisterial&quot; and a &quot;majestic title track&quot; that &quot;leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative&quot;.118 To Simon Leng, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is &quot;a classic of Harrison's lyrical ambiguity, in essence a hopeful song, without sounding so&quot;, with a lyric that &quot;approaches Bob Dylan standard&quot;.119 Ian Inglis also praises the lyrics, writing: &quot;The song contains some of Harrison's most insightful and pensive words. 'Daylight is good at arriving at the right time' is a fine example of his ... ability to position the profound within the commonplace.&quot;120
Elliot Huntley rates &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as one of Harrison's &quot;most beautiful&quot; songs, &quot;if not the very best&quot;, and the &quot;centrepiece&quot; of its parent album.121 Huntley questions why it wasn't sequenced as the closing track to All Things Must Pass and adds: &quot;In its sentiments, the song would actually have been an equally fitting conclusion to Abbey Road.&quot;122
On a triple album where &quot;nearly every song is excellent&quot;, Allmusic picks &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as one of five standout tracks (or AMG Track Picks).123 Bruce Spizer rates the song as a &quot;highlight&quot; of Harrison's career,124 while Leng goes further by declaring it &quot;perhaps the greatest solo Beatle composition&quot; of all.125
In his acclaimed book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald describes &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; as &quot;the wisest song never recorded by The Beatles&quot;.126
Performances and later releases
Despite its standing as one of his best-known songs,127 &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was not a track that Harrison ever played in concert, although it was included on a preliminary setlist for the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh shows.128 He twice performed the song live in front of TV cameras during the final years of his life, beginning with his appearance with Ravi Shankar on VH1's Hard Rock Live, filmed in New York on 14 May 1997.129130 The pair were on the show to promote their recent collaboration, the &quot;quiet masterpiece&quot; Chants of India album,131 but at host John Fugelsang's urging, Harrison accepted an acoustic guitar and performed a brief rendition of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.132133 150 minutes of Harrison and Shankar's appearance was filmed, but only 22 minutes of footage was originally aired by VH1 on 24 July as George &amp; Ravi &lt;U+2212&gt; Yin &amp; Yang.134 Omitted from the broadcast but also performed by Harrison was the Traveling Wilburys tune &quot;If You Belonged to Me&quot; and, at the suggestion of Shankar's wife, Sukanya, &quot;Any Road&quot;, a track subsequently released on his posthumous album Brainwashed.135136 In late 2000, Harrison sang &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; while sitting on Friar Park's main lawn, a performance that was included in the press kit for the All Things Must Pass 30th Anniversary reissue (which was delayed until January 2001 from the true anniversary date).137
Omitted from the &quot;cursory&quot; selection of 1970&lt;U+2212&gt;75 tracks on The Best of George Harrison, the song was included on Harrison's 2009 career-spanning compilation Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison.138
In Martin Scorsese's 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is the first song featured in the movie, played over footage of German air raids over Britain during World War II.139 In November that year, a demo of the song, featuring just Harrison, Starr and bassist Klaus Voormann, was included on the deluxe edition CD accompanying the British DVD release of the film; this CD was subsequently issued worldwide in May 2012 as Early Takes: Volume 1.140Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;George Harrison: Early Takes, Vol. 1&quot;, Allmusic (retrieved 15 September 2012).
