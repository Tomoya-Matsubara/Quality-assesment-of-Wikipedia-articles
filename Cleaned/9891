Gregory James &quot;Greg&quot; LeMond (born June 26, 1961) is a former professional road bicycle racer, entrepreneur, and anti-doping advocate from the United States. He was World Champion in 1983 and 1989, and is a three-time winner of the Tour de France. LeMond was born in Lakewood, California, and raised in ranch country on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range,1 about an hour's drive from Reno, Nevada.23 He is married and has three children with his wife Kathy, with whom he supports a variety of charitable causes and organizations.4
In 1986, LeMond became the first non-European (and only American) professional cyclist to win the Tour de France.5 He was accidentally shot while hunting in 1987 and missed the next two Tours.67 LeMond returned to the Tour in 1989, completing an improbable comeback by winning in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage. He successfully defended his title the following year, claiming his third and final Tour victory in 1990, and making LeMond one of only seven riders who have won three or more Tours.8 LeMond retired from competition in December 1994, but has remained active in professional cycling through various commercial and sporting projects.
Racing career
Greg LeMond was a standout junior rider &quot;of superlative quality&quot; and &quot;exceptionally gifted,&quot;9 who quickly established himself as one of the most talented cyclists on the professional circuit.10 Respected cycling journalist John Wilcockson, who reported the Tour de France for more than 40 years, described LeMond as a rider who was fuoriclasse.{{#tag:ref|Quote: Fuoriclasse means much more than being gifted. In cycling, it is someone who has a slow pulse, large lungs, perfectly proportioned limbs, lean muscles, and, above all, the brain and mindset to utilize all those attributes to win the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s toughest races at the youngest possible age.|group=N}}
1976&lt;U+2013&gt;1983: Early career
LeMond's introduction to cycling came thanks to freestyle skiing pioneer Wayne Wong in 1975.11 LeMond started competing in 1976, and after dominating the Intermediate category (13-15) and winning the first 11 races he entered,12 he received permission to ride against older, more seasoned competitors in the Junior (16-19) category.13 In 1977, while still only 15, LeMond finished second in the Tour of Fresno to John Howard, America's top road cyclist and the 1971 Pan American Games champion.14 LeMond caught the attention of Eddie Borysewicz, the US Cycling Federation's national team coach, who described LeMond as &quot;a diamond, a clear diamond.&quot;15 LeMond represented the United States at the 1978 Junior World Championships in Washington, D.C., where he finished ninth in the road race,16 and again in the 1979 Junior World Championships in Argentina,17 where he won gold, silver and bronze medals&lt;U+2014&gt;the highlight being his victory in the road race.18 At age 18, LeMond was selected for the 1980 U.S. Olympic cycling team, the youngest ever to make the U.S. team;19 however, the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow prevented him from competing there.20
Borysewicz, whom LeMond described as his &quot;first real coach,&quot;21 wanted to retain his prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt; through the next Olympic-cycle and discouraged him from turning pro, but LeMond was determined. Nevertheless, while he was the reigning Junior World Road Champion in 1980, LeMond received no offers, and so in the spring 1980, he joined the U.S. National cycling team for a 6-week European racing campaign. There, he finished third overall in the Circuit des Ardennes22 before winning the 1980 Circuit de la Sarthe stage race in France,23 thereby becoming the first American and youngest rider of any nationality &quot;in the history of the sport to win a major pro-am cycling event [in Europe].&quot;24 That victory, and the subsequent press coverage, raised LeMond's profile in Europe and he was scouted at his next event (the Ruban Granitier Breton stage race) by French cycling coach and Renault-Elf-Gitane directeur sportif Cyrille Guimard. Guimard said he was impressed with LeMond's spirit, and told him, &quot;You have the fire to be a great champion,&quot; before offering him a professional contract for 1981 with Renault.25 After he returned to the United States, LeMond won the 1980 Nevada City Classic, considered to be one of the most historic and challenging professional cycling races in America.2627 Despite eventually receiving several other offers to turn professional besides Guimard's, LeMond did not consider them seriously, and he signed with Renault in Paris on the day the Tour de France finished.28
LeMond's first professional victory came three months after his 1981 debut, when he won a stage of the French Tour de l'Oise. He also won the Coors Classic in the United States, finishing ahead of the 1980 Olympic road champion Sergue&lt;U+00EF&gt; Soukhoroutchenkov, but LeMond considered his third-place overall in the 1981 Dauphin&lt;U+00E9&gt; Lib&lt;U+00E9&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt; to have been the &quot;major steppingstone,&quot; in his career thus far, saying, &quot;It showed me that I had the kind of climbing ability that you need to win the top European stage races.&quot;29
LeMond won the silver medal at the 1982 World Cycling Championship, and in 1983, he won the World Championship outright, becoming the first American rider to do so.30 His enormous talent &lt;U+2013&gt; his overall strength, climbing ability, his capability to ride a fast time trial and his recovery capacity &lt;U+2013&gt; suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for the more demanding Grand Tours.31
1984&lt;U+2013&gt;1986: Grand Tours
LeMond rode his first Tour de France in 1984 for Renault-Elf-Gitane, under the guidance of Cyrille Guimard. He finished third overall while riding in support of team leader Laurent Fignon, and won the young rider classification. After this auspicious debut, French businessman Bernard Tapie and his superstar Bernard Hinault approached LeMond with a one-million dollar contract offer - the first in cycling's history - to leave Renault-Elf-Gitane at the end of 1984 and join Hinault at La Vie Claire for three years. LeMond accepted the offer and joined on a 3-year contract to first ride in support of team captain Bernard Hinault, who had regained his form and was attempting to win his fifth Tour.32 Hinault led the 1985 Tour de France through the early mountain stages, but suffered a crash and began to struggle. And as Hinault faltered, LeMond realized he was capable of winning the Tour in his own right, but Tapie and La Vie Claire DS Paul K&lt;U+00F6&gt;chli ordered the 24-year-old LeMond to wait and ride in support of Hinault.33 So instead of pressing his advantage, LeMond let the leaders pull away and dropped back to aid Hinault, who went on to win the 1985 Tour, with LeMond in second, 1:42 behind. LeMond was clearly frustrated by the events, and later revealed that team management and K&lt;U+00F6&gt;chli had misled him as to how far back Hinault was during the crucial mountain stage.34{{#tag:ref|Quote: &quot;Yes, but they lied to me. I had about a three to four minute lead on him at that point, but I thought I only had about 45 seconds. Every time I asked them exactly how much time I had they'd evade the answer, telling me Hinault was in the group right behind me. Then when the pack of riders came up with Sean Kelly and Phil Anderson, guys who I climbed much better than, Hinault was still nowhere in sight....It was Bernard Tapie's and Paul Keochli's conspiracy to make sure Hinault won his fifth Tour.&quot;|group=N}} Regardless, LeMond rode as the dutiful lieutenant, and his support enabled Hinault to win his fifth Tour.
 The following year in the 1986 Tour, LeMond was made co-leader of the La Vie Claire team alongside Hinault, with Hinault publicly promising to ride in support of LeMond to repay LeMond for the work he had done in 1985.3536 What he did not say was that the help was contingent upon LeMond demonstrating that he was clearly the better rider. Hinault was in superb form, and had the chance to win an unprecedented sixth Tour. In Stage 12, the first mountain stage of the race in the Pyrenees, Hinault attacked the lead group and built up an overall lead. By the end of Stage 12, Hinault had a five-minute lead over LeMond and the other top riders. He claimed he was trying to draw out LeMond's rivals, but none of these attacks were planned with LeMond. He was clearly willing to ride aggressively and take advantage of the opportunities presented. LeMond was never in trouble, except by his own teammate. The following day Hinault broke away again early but was caught and then dropped by LeMond on the final climb of Stage 13, allowing LeMond to gain back four and a half minutes. The next three stages brought the Tour to the Alps. On Stage 17 LeMond and Urs Zimmermann dropped Hinault from the leading group, and the end of the day saw LeMond pulling on the yellow jersey of race leader, the first time it had ever been worn by a rider from the United States.37 The following day in the Alps saw Hinault attack again early on the first climb, but he was pulled back. Attempting an escape on the descent, he was unable to separate himself from LeMond. The two La Vie Claire team leaders continued to pull away as they ascended the next col, and maintained the gap as they reached the base of the final climb, the vaunted Alpe d'Huez. They put on a showcase of strength and form through the twenty-one switchbacks, cresting the summit together. LeMond put an arm around Hinault and gave him a smile and the stage win in a show of unity,38 but the infighting was not over. Hinault attacked again on Stage 19 and had to be brought back by teammates Andy Hampsten and Steve Bauer. Commenting on the team situation prior to the final individual time trial at Stage 20, LeMond offered the following with a wry smile:
&quot;He's attacked me from the beginning of the Tour De France. He's never helped me once, and I don't feel confident at all with him.&quot;39
LeMond had to keep his eye on his teammate and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable.40 LeMond would keep the yellow jersey to the end of the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership, declaring that &quot;[Hinault] hasn't helped me one iota.... I have no respect for him anymore.... I know I'll never be friends with him again after this race. Not the way he's treated me.&quot;41 LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.
1987&lt;U+2013&gt;1988: Accidental shooting, lost years
 LeMond had planned to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but was unable to participate. Early that year he was riding in the Tirreno-Adriatico, an early spring tune-up race, when he fell, suffering a fracture to his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe he elected to go turkey hunting near his family home in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law.42 The camouflaged hunters were at a ranch co-owned by Louis Barber, the father of LeMond's uncle, and Bob LeMond, Greg's father.4344 The trio had become separated when Blades heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush.45 The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were near fatal. Fortunately a police helicopter was available nearby, and was used to make a fifteen minute life-flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65% of his blood volume.46 The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting.47 He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He subsequently informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, but the rest of the story was left somewhat vague.48 The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.49
With 35 shotgun pellets still in his body, including three in the lining of his heart and five more embedded in his liver,50 LeMond attempted to return to racing in 1988. But his comeback was hampered by over-training, and he developed tendonitis in his right shin that required surgery. He missed the Tour for the second year running, and relations with PDM soured.51 Said LeMond:
They had lost total confidence in me. They were trying to claim that maybe my liver was bad, my lung was shot up, maybe I had lead poisoning. That's why I wasn't riding well. They said, 'Maybe you're not going to ever come back.'52
In response to the falling-out with PDM, LeMond moved to ADR, a team based in Belgium and co-sponsored by Coors Light for American races,53 in a deal that was completed on New Year's Eve, just hours before he would have been legally obligated to ride another season for the Dutch team. According to veteran Tour correspondent Samuel Abt:
The Dutch team did not want him back and his market value was low, because he had not won a race since he was wounded by shotgun pellets in a hunting accident in April 1987, almost a year after he became the first American to win the Tour de France.54
Joining the Belgian ADR squad allowed LeMond to continue to compete, but with teammates like Johan Museeuw who were better suited to riding Classics than Grand Tours.55
1989: Return to elite level
 After struggling in the 1989 Paris-Nice race and failing to find his form, LeMond informed his wife Kathy that he intended to retire from professional cycling after the 1989 Tour de France.56 LeMond rode the 1989 Giro d'Italia as preparation for the Tour to follow, but was consistently dropped on the climbs and was not in contention for any of the race jerseys. However the race closed with a 53 km individual time trial into Florence. After being treated for anemia with an iron injection earlier in the race57 and with the racing miles from the Giro's earlier stages now in his legs, LeMond placed second on this 22nd and final stage of the 1989 Giro d'Italia, beating overall Giro winner Laurent Fignon by over a minute on the stage.58
Coming into the Tour LeMond was not considered a contender for the General Classification (GC).5960{{#tag:ref|General Classification tracks overall times for bicycle riders in multi-stage bicycle races. Each stage will have a stage winner, but the overall winner of the race is the rider with the lowest time in the GC. That is, the rider who has the fastest time when all the stage results are added together.|group=N}} His own most optimistic hope was to finish his final Tour in the top 20.61 Without the weight of expectation or the typical pressure suffered by a Tour de France favorite, LeMond surprised observers with a strong ride in the 7.8 km prologue in Luxembourg, finishing fourth out of 198 riders. Buoyed by the result, LeMond rode himself into first place in the 73 km stage 5 individual time trial, which gave him the yellow jersey of race leader for the first time in three years. The Tour reached the first mountains &lt;U+2013&gt; the Pyr&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;es. And although he lost the lead to his former teammate and rival Laurent Fignon on stage 10 in Superbagn&lt;U+00E8&gt;res, LeMond reclaimed yellow five days later in the Alps, after the 39 km stage 15 mountain time trial from Gap to Orci&lt;U+00E8&gt;res-Merlette. But it was Fignon who seemed to have won the see-saw battle and sealed a third overall victory, when he cracked LeMond on stage 17 with 4 km to go up the climb of Alpe d'Huez. Fignon held a 50-second advantage over LeMond going into the 21st and final stage, a rare 24.5 km individual time trial from Versailles to Paris (Champs-&lt;U+00C9&gt;lys&lt;U+00E9&gt;es).
Fignon had won the Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a very capable time trialist. It seemed almost impossible for LeMond to make up 50 seconds over the 24.5 kilometer course, which would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer against one of the fastest chrono-specialists in the world.626364 But LeMond rode the time trial with a cut-down Giro aero helmet and innovative Scott clip-on aero bars, which created less aerodynamic drag than traditional time trial equipment, while Fignon chose to go helmetless, using standard &quot;cowhorn&quot; handlebars. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times,6566 LeMond rode flat-out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 58 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-&lt;U+00C9&gt;lys&lt;U+00E9&gt;es, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.67 The final margin of victory of eight seconds was the closest in the Tour's history.6869 LeMond's 54.545 km/h average speed for the stage 21 time trial was the fastest in Tour history; since then, only the 1994 prologue70 and David Zabriskie's 2005 time trial performance have been faster.71
LeMond's spectacular comeback was reconfirmed on August 27, when he again out-dueled Fignon to win the 259 km World Championships road race in Chamb&lt;U+00E9&gt;ry, France, beating Dimitri Konyshev and Sean Kelly on the line.727374 Fignon attacked incessantly in the wet, treacherous finale, but LeMond marked his rival and made the perfect sprint; Fignon finished 6th.75 In December, Sports Illustrated magazine named LeMond its 1989 &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot;, the first time a cyclist received the honor.767778
1990: A third tour win
After his storybook 1989-season, LeMond parlayed his success into the richest contract in the sport's history, signing a $5.5 million deal for three years with Z-Tomasso of France.79 He entered the 1990 Tour de France as defending champion and a pre-race favorite after leaving ADR to join the much stronger Z-Tomasso team. At &quot;Z&quot; his team mates included Robert Millar, Eric Boyer and Ronan Pensec, all of whom already had finishes in the top six of the Tour de France. This unified roster of strong riders appeared capable of supporting LeMond in the mountains and controlling the race on the flats.80
The squad's tactical plan was upset on the first day, when a breakaway that included LeMond's teammate Ronan Pensec, but no major favorites, arrived ten minutes ahead of the field. LeMond was prevented from challenging for the lead until the final individual time trial on stage 20, when he finished over two minutes ahead of Claudio Chiappucci, overhauling the unheralded Italian in the General Classification and taking the yellow jersey, which he held to Paris. LeMond had the distinction of winning the 1990 Tour without taking victory in a single individual stage. The perceived strength of the Z team was vindicated when they led the team classification for most of the race winning this to add to LeMond's yellow jersey.
In September, LeMond attempted to defend his title at the 1990 UCI Road World Championships, but instead finished fourth, eight seconds behind the winner, his former teammate Rudy Dhaenens of Belgium.81
1991&lt;U+2013&gt;1994: Decline and retirement
 LeMond felt confident before the 1991 Tour de France. He was the defending champion, trained well and had a solid team to support him. LeMond was among the leaders going into the Stage 8 individual time trial, and he finished second to the Spaniard Miguel Indurain. LeMond felt he was riding extremely well, and though his TT-effort had propelled him into the yellow jersey, losing eight seconds to Indurain shook his confidence.82 He held the yellow jersey for the next four days until Stage 12, a challenging 192 km mountain stage. LeMond experienced difficulty on the first climb and he cracked on the Col de Tourmalet, losing significant time to Claudio Chiappucci, and eventual winner Indurain. He continued to race, but was unable to seriously challenge for the lead thereafter, finishing the 1991 Tour seventh overall.83
In 1992, LeMond won the Tour DuPont, but it would be the last major win of his career. He failed to finish the 1992 Tour de France &lt;U+2013&gt; he abandoned in the mountains on the same day that his compatriot and former domestique Andy Hampsten won atop Alpe d'Huez.84 LeMond had started the Tour in a state of fatigue and near-panic after problems traveling to France,85 and he said he quit the race because of a serious saddle sore, but before he abandoned, LeMond admitted, &quot;My climbing is not like usual. I've climbed much better in the past Tours. This year I'm just not feeling my usual self.&quot;86 Something was amiss.
LeMond did extensive endurance training on the road that winter, but his performances the following spring failed to improve. LeMond had to abandon the 1993 Giro d'Italia two days before the final stage after difficult racing left him third-from-last on GC. He was too exhausted to enter the 1993 Tour de France.87 Following the '93 season LeMond hired renowned Dutch physiologist Adrie van Diemen to advise him on a new technic to monitor training and measure performance. The (SRM) power-based training would make use of the watt as a guide to power output.88 In November 1993 LeMond confided to Sam Abt that power output in watts would become the key metric.89 {{#tag:ref|Quote: I know about training. I wrote a book about training. But I got away from what I used to do. I was doing cross-country skiing and easy riding in the winter and I'm starting to go in the opposite way now, working on my power, lifting weights with my legs, working on increasing my oxygen consumption. I'm watching my weight. I need to build my power and strength up as high as I can and then worry about my endurance. Endurance is the easiest aspect to build up. What I'm doing now is the opposite of what I've been doing, always working on my endurance. Except in 1989, when I did a lot of power training in the winter and that year I had great results as early as February. I'm not going to rush. I'm going to build up slowly, that's my goal, to really have a good base so that when I start racing hard in February, March and April, my body doesn't get tired from it and I get better. Which hasn't been the case the last couple of years.|group=N}} The watt is the measure cyclists most often look to to gauge their performance today.
The following year LeMond began the 1994 Tour de France but found he was unable to race effectively. He had to abandon after the first week before the race had reached the difficult mountain stages. That December he announced his retirement. The reasons for LeMond's difficulties in his later career are not entirely known. At the time of his retirement he cited mitochondrial myopathy{{#tag:ref|Mitochondrial myopathy is a rare condition in which the body&lt;U+2019&gt;s cellular energy system breaks down.|group=N}} as the cause of his inability to perform.90 However in 2007 LeMond speculated that he might not have the condition afterall, but rather was victim to lead toxicity from the shotgun pellets still embedded in his body, the effects of which were increased by overtraining.9192
LeMond acknowledged that the increasing prevalence of doping might have contributed to his own lack of competitiveness. Said LeMond: &quot;Something had changed in cycling. The speeds were faster and riders that I had easily out performed were now dropping me. At the time, the team I was on, Team Z, became more and more demanding, more and more concerned...&quot;93 He stated he had been told in 1994 that he would need to blood dope in order to win again.94 LeMond did not focus solely on doping for his difficulties. He frankly admitted to Abt in 1999: &quot;I figure I had three months that went right for me after the hunting accident,&quot; three months in which he won the two Tours and a world road race championship. &quot;The rest were just pure suffering, struggling, fatigue, always tired.&quot;95
In a wide-ranging interview with American novelist Bryan Malessa in 1998, LeMond was asked if his career had not been interrupted by the hunting accident, how did he feel he would compare to five time Tour winners such as Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurian. LeMond responded: &quot;Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident that I would have won five Tours.&quot;96{{#tag:ref|Quote:Interviewer:&quot;Barring your hunting accident, do you feel like your were capable of joining the ranks of riders like Hinualt and Indurain? Do you feel that you could have won five Tours?&quot; LeMond: &quot;Well, look at the facts. I have three Tour victories. I gave away the '85 Tour. I was out because of an accident during the two prime years of my career, '87 and '88, which were two of the easiest years to win the Tour in that period. I mean if you're in the thick of racing, you understand the hierarchy. During those two years, Hinault was out, Fignon was out. Put it this way, in '89 and '90 I only feel like I raced to 90 to 95 percent of my potential. In '86 I was much stronger, climbed much faster, much better time-trialist. When we would do the time-trials, Hinault and I would finish two to three minutes up on most people. And you have to remember that in cycling, every year you make minute improvements. In '86 I wasn't out of the top five stage races from February to September. Of course you can't rewrite racing history, but I'm confident that I would have won five Tours.&quot;|group=N}}
LeMond may have only three Tours de France to his credit, but two years after retiring, on June 8, 1996, he was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in a ceremony at Rodale Park in Trexlertown, PA, during the U.S. Olympic Cycling Team Trials.9798
Business interests
 Greg LeMond was a pioneer in the use of carbon fiber bicycle frames in European professional road cycling, and his Tour de France win in 1986 ahead of Bernard Hinault was the first for carbon.99 Ironically, given the rivalry that existed at the time between the American and his French teammate, LeMond rode a &quot;Bernard Hinault&quot; Signature Model Look prototype that year.100 LeMond also won the 1989 Tour and World's, and his final Tour de France in 1990 on carbon fiber frames, which had begun to feature &quot;Greg LeMond&quot; branding.
LeMond Cycles
In 1990, LeMond founded LeMond Bicycles to develop machines for himself that would also be marketed and sold to the public. The following year, searching for an equipment edge for Team Z at the 1991 Tour de France, LeMond concluded an exclusive licensing agreement between his company and Carbonframes, Inc., to access the latter's advanced composites technology.101 While LeMond briefly led the 1991 Tour overall, riding his Carbonframes-produced &quot;Greg LeMond&quot; bicycle, the company eventually faltered, something LeMond blamed on &quot;under-capitalization&quot; and poor management by his father.102 Carbonframes and LeMond Cycles &quot;parted amiably two years later.&quot;103 In 1995, with his company allegedly nearly-bankrupt, LeMond reached a licensing-agreement with Trek Bicycle Corporation, according to which the Wisconsin-based company would manufacture and distribute bicycles designed with LeMond that would be sold under the &quot;LeMond Bicycles&quot; brand.104 LeMond would later claim that going into business with Trek &quot;destroyed&quot; his relationship with his father.105 The lucrative partnership, which generated revenue for Trek in excess of $100,000,000USD, would be renewed several times over the course of 13 years, but it ultimately ended in acrimony after LeMond's relationship with Trek deteriorated over his staunch anti-doping advocacy.106
The two parties first found themselves at odds in July 2001, after LeMond expressed public concern over the relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek's star athlete, Lance Armstrong. &quot;When I heard he was working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated,&quot; LeMond was quoted as saying of Armstrong. &quot;If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud.&quot;107108
Trek's president John Burke pressured LeMond to apologize, claiming, &lt;U+201C&gt;Greg&lt;U+2019&gt;s public comments hurt the LeMond brand and the Trek brand.&quot;109110 Burke allegedly justified his demand for an apology by advising that, &quot;As a contractual partner, he [LeMond] could criticize doping only generally &lt;U+2013&gt; not point his finger at specific athletes, particularly one that happens to be the company's main cash cow.&quot;111
In April 2008, Trek announced that it was dropping LeMond Bicycles from its product line and would sue to sever the licensing agreement. It quickly emerged that in March 2008, LeMond had filed a complaint against Trek for breach of contract, claiming that they had not made a &quot;best efforts&quot; attempt to sell his bicycles, as well as describing attempts to 'silence' him about doping, including incidents in 2001 and 2004.112 His complaint included statistics detailing slow sales in some markets, including the fact that between September 2001 and June 2007, Trek only sold $10,393 worth of LeMond bikes in France, a country in which LeMond was both famous and popular.113
 As promised, Trek counter-sued and stopped producing bicycles under the LeMond brand.114 After nearly two years of litigation, in February 2010, LeMond reached an out-of-court settlement with Trek in their breach-of-contract dispute, the terms of which were confidential.115 The settlement permitted the case to be dismissed with prejudice, meaning, &quot;neither side can produce the same claims against one another in a future lawsuit.&quot;116 And although settlement terms were not disclosed, LeMond reportedly obtained full control over the LeMond Bicycles name, while Trek made a donation of $200,000USD to the 1in6.org charity, of which LeMond was a founding member of the board of directors.117118
LeMond Fitness
In 2002, LeMond, Bernie Boglioli and others founded LeMond Fitness, Inc. &quot;to help individuals achieve their fitness and performance goals and train more effectively.&quot;119 The company's primary business is the development and manufacture of bicycle trainers and indoor exercise bikes for consumers in the United States and internationally.120 LeMond himself serves as Chairman of the Board, and, according to company sources, &quot;is integrally involved in the development and design of our products and programs.&quot;121 In 2012, Hoist Fitness negotiated to purchase an interest in the company and announced plans to move its headquarters to Hoist's offices in San Diego, CA.122
Real Estate
In 2002 LeMond joined with his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson to invest in the exclusive Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra.123 Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375 million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209 million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16 billion Cushman &amp; Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6 million for their one-percent shares.124 In 2007 LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39 million;125 however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20 million payment, followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.126
Restaurants
LeMond became a restaurateur in August 1990, when, in partnership with his wife and her parents, he opened Scott Kee's Tour de France on France Avenue in the Minneapolis suburb of Edina, Minnesota.127128 LeMond described the restaurant, which was named for its chef (LeMond's brother-in-law), as &quot;a dream of five years come true.&quot; Explaining the origin of the concept, LeMond said, &quot;Kathy and I have eaten at the finest establishments in France, Italy and Belgium. Our favorites have always been small places, family-owned.&quot;129
LeMond also partnered in several Bruegger's bagel bakery-caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; franchises.130131
Anti-doping stance and controversies
 LeMond is a longtime anti-doping advocate and a vocal opponent of performance-enhancing drug use. He first spoke on-record against doping in cycling after winning the 1989 Tour de France132, but LeMond attracted more substantial attention in 2001 when he publicly expressed doubts about the legitimacy of Lance Armstrong's success after learning of his relationship with Dr. Michele Ferrari.133134135 The intense criticism LeMond was subjected to for his comments placed him at the center of an anti-doping controversy.
LeMond has consistently questioned the relationship between riders and unethical sports doctors like Ferrari,136 and has pointed out that the professional cyclists who make use of doping products are ultimately victimized by the process, likening their treatment to that of &quot;lab rats.&quot; Said LeMond: &quot;The doctors, the management, the officials, they're the ones that have corrupted riders. The riders are the only ones that pay the price.&quot; LeMond's most contentious or notable conflicts have been with fellow Tour riders Lance Armstrong, Floyd Landis and Alberto Contador.
LeMond has also been directly critical of the Union Cycliste Internationale and its president, Pat McQuaid. In December 2012, LeMond claimed that a change needed to be made at the head of leadership for the UCI, and stated if called upon he would be willing to take the position himself if necessary to lead cycling out of the mire of doping. Said LeMond:
&quot;It is now or never to act. After the earthquake caused by the Armstrong case, another chance will not arise. I am willing to invest to make this institution more democratic, transparent and look for the best candidate in the longer term.&quot;137
LeMond was one of the first prominent professional cyclists to openly decry the sport's descent into the corruption of doping.
Personal life
LeMond attended Wooster High School in Reno, NV. His parents are Bob LeMond and Bertha (d. 2006), and he has two sisters, Kathy and Karen. Greg is married to Kathy Morris, and together they have three children &lt;U+2013&gt; two sons (Geoffrey and Scott) and a daughter (Simone).138 LeMond and his wife live in Medina, Minnesota. Since his retirement, LeMond has become increasingly involved in philanthropic efforts relating to causes that have affected him personally (including ADHD and sexual abuse),139 and he and Kathy both sit on the board of the non-profit 1in6.140141142
LeMond is an avid outdoor enthusiast and fly angler,143144 and in 1991 &lt;U+2013&gt; while still racing full-time &lt;U+2013&gt; he made the world-record fly fishing catch of a four-pound smallmouth bass on a reel with a four-pound tippet. The record was certified by the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame in Hayward, Wisconsin. The catch exceeded the then-previous record of three pounds, six ounces made on the same size tippet back in 1986.145 LeMond confessed, &quot;I always pack my fly fishing equipment when I travel to bike events. I fish every chance I get.&quot;146
After retiring from pro cycling, LeMond competed in Formula Ford 2000 series auto racing.147148 He is also a motivational speaker and was the guest speaker for Sumitomo Drive Technologies' International Sales Meeting in Cancun, Mexico on May 2, 2008. LeMond narrated an award-winning documentary for Adventures for the Cure that same year.
On July 16, 2007, LeMond rode the L'&lt;U+00C9&gt;tape du Tour cyclosportive with his son, and found it to be a defining moment in his post-competition life. &quot;I had the time of my life&quot;, he said, despite getting &quot;650th place&quot; and being &quot;impressed that I even finished&quot;. LeMond continued, &quot;I decided that day that nobody's going to keep me from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody.&quot;149 At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called LeMond and threatened to disclose that he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse should LeMond appear in court as scheduled.150 Undeterred, LeMond took the stand the following day, testified, and also admitted to the world that he had been molested.151
Several weeks later, LeMond and his wife Kathy gave an extensive interview to Paul Kimmage of The Sunday Times. LeMond provided additional details concerning the circumstances of his 2001 apology to Armstrong, stating that Trek, the longtime manufacturer and distributor of LeMond Racing Cycles, had threatened to end the relationship at the behest of Armstrong. He described the two years following the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his life since.152
In September 2007, Greg LeMond became a founding board member of the non-profit organization 1in6.org, whose mission is &quot;to help men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood live healthy, happy lives&quot;.153
