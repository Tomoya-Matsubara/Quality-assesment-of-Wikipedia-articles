Kang Tai was a Wu Chinese traveller in the middle of the third century. He is known for his travels to Southeast Asia in which he became one of the first Chinese, along with Zhu Ying, to document the existence of the kingdom known as Funan in Chinese records.1 He was reportedly impressed with the accomplishments of Funan as well as with its capital city and reported that the written language of Funan bore similarities to Indian script.2
