Hartenstein joined the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic in 1928. After a period of training on surface vessels and service on various torpedo boats, he transferred to the U-boat service in 1941. In September 1942, Hartenstein was involved in the Laconia incident. He and the entire crew of U-156 were killed in action by depth charges from a US PBY Catalina aircraft on 8 March 1943.
Early life and pre-war service
Hartenstein was born in Plauen in the Vogtland of the Kingdom of Saxony on 27 February 1908. He was the second child of William Karl Adolf Hartenstein, an export merchant, and Selma Emma Hartenstein, n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Schlingensiepen.1 Hartenstein had an older sister, Thea, and a younger sister, Charlotte. He celebrated his confirmation in 1923 and graduated from the humanistische Staatsgymnasium (humanities-oriented secondary school) in Plauen with his Abitur (diploma) in 1926. Prior to joining the military service studied two semesters of jurisprudence. He signed in at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Freiburg (University of Freiburg) in Freiburg im Breisgau on 29 April 1927.2
Aged 20, Hartenstein began his naval career with the Reichsmarine on 1 April 1928 as a member &quot;Crew 1928&quot; (the incoming class of 1928).{{#tag:ref|The German Reichsmarine which was renamed the Kriegsmarine on 1 June 1935.|group=&quot;Note&quot;}} After he underwent basic military training in the 2nd department (II. Abteilung) of the standing ship division (Schiffsstammdivision) of the Baltic Sea in Stralsund (1 April 1928 &lt;U+2013&gt; 30 June 1928), he was transferred to the training ship Niobe (1 July 1928 &lt;U+2013&gt; 15 October 1928) attaining the rank of Seekadett (Naval Cadet) on 11 October 1928. Following a fourteen month stay onboard cruiser Emden (16 October 1928 &lt;U+2013&gt; 3 January 1930) he advanced in rank to F&lt;U+00E4&gt;hnrich zur See (Ensign) on 1 January 1930. Hartenstein then underwent a number of officer training courses at the Naval Academy at M&lt;U+00FC&gt;rwik, including navigational training cruises on the survey vessel Meteor, before transferring to the light cruiser K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ln (1 October 1931 &lt;U+2013&gt; 23 September 1934). His stay on K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ln was occasionally interrupted to attend further training courses at Wilhelmshaven and Kiel-Wik.3
Hartenstein served as I. Wachoffizier (1st watch officer) on torpedo boat Greif from 30 September 1936 to 13 November 1938.4 Hartenstein was promoted to Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant (captain lieutenant) on 1 June 1937. He participated in numerous patrols in 1937 to 1938 on board Greif in Spanish waters as part of the &quot;Legion Condor&quot; during the Spanish Civil War. For these services he was awarded the Spanish Cross in Bronze () on 6 June 1936.5
World War II
Attached to commanding torpedo boats before the war, he completed 65 patrols in the North Sea, Norwegian waters, Bay of Biscay and in the English Channel in the first period of the war.6 Hartenstein took command of torpedo boat Seeadler on 20 November 1938. In October 1939 Hartenstein transferred and switched command of torpedo boat Jaguar with Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant Franz Kohlauf who took over command of Seeadler. On 30 March 1941, command of Jaguar was given to Kapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;nleutnant Friedrich-Karl Paul and Hartenstein transferred to the U-boat force, and on 4 September 1941 given command of U-156. For his service on torpedo boats, Hartenstein was awarded the German Cross in Gold () on 2 February 1942.ll p258&quot;/&gt; On her second patrol Hartenstein commanded a wolf pack of U-boats during the Attack on Aruba in February 1942, attacking an oil refinery. Karl D&lt;U+00F6&gt;nitz personnally pinned the German Cross in Gold on Harteinstein's leather jacket on 17 March 1942.ll p34&quot;/&gt;
3rd patrol
 On Hartenstein's third patrol (22 April 1942 &lt;U+2013&gt; 7 July 1942), U-156 sank twelve ships and damaged a further two, including the USS Blakeley on 25 May 1942. This achievement earned Hartenstein a reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 6 June 1942. The Wehrmachtbericht was an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht. To be singled out individually in the Wehrmachtbericht was an honour and was entered in the Orders and Decorations' section of one's Service Record Book.7
U-156 positioned near Fort-de-France was ordered to observe the traffic to and from Martinique. Lying roughly  off shore, the hydrophones detected a ship. Hartenstein attacked from a submerged position firing two torpedoes. One torpedo struck the bow of the Blakeley after a 25-second run-time. Hartenstein observed that the bow was completely blown away but its engines kept running. The waters around Martinique were extremely shallow and Hartenstein decided not to pursue the destroyer.8
4th patrol and Laconia incident
 On U-156's fourth patrol (20 August 1942 &lt;U+2013&gt; 16 November 1942), Hartenstein organised the rescue of the survivors of RMS Laconia, resulting in the Laconia incident and Laconia order.9
On 12 September 1942 U-156 was patrolling off the coast of West Africa midway between Liberia and Ascension Island roughly  south of Cape Palmas. At 11.37 the aft port lookout sighted a smoke stack at 230 degrees. Hartenstein followed the target, which was zigzagging at , until the general direction of the large ocean liner became evident. U-156 was running at  into a favorable attack position. Hartenstein ordered the attack at 21.07. He lowered speed at 22.00 and ordered a surfaced deflection shot from torpedo tubes I and III. After three minutes and six seconds the first torpedo detonated followed shortly by the second.10 He hoped to capture the ship's senior officers. To his surprise, Hartenstein saw over two thousand people struggling in the water. Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations. Laconia sank at 23:23.
At 6.00 Hartenstein ordered the following message send on the 25m wavelength:11
&quot;If any ship will assist the ship-wrecked Laconia crew, I will not attack providing I am not being attacked by ship or air forces. I picked up 193 men. 4&lt;U+00B0&gt;53 South/11&lt;U+00B0&gt;26 West &lt;U+2013&gt; German submarine&quot;ll p89&quot;/&gt;
The message was repeated twice on the international 600m wavelength.ll p89&quot;/&gt; Heading to a rendezvous with Vichy French ships under Red Cross banners, the U-boats were attacked by a U.S. Army B-24 Liberator bomber at 12.32 on 16 September 1942.12
U-156 received a radio message on 17 September 1942 indicating that Werner Hartenstein, as 63rd member of the U-boat service and 125th of the Kriegsmarine, was awarded Germany's highest military honor, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Hartenstein handed out one bottle of beer for each member of the crew. Celebrating the event, Hartenstein held a speech, honoring the achievements of everyone and that he would wear this decoration in their name.13
5th patrol and death
During her fifth patrol, on 8 March 1943, Hartenstein and the entire crew of U-156 were killed in action by depth charges from a US PBY Catalina aircraft (VP-53/P-1; Lieutenant E. Dryden), east of Barbados. The Catalina dropped four Mark 44 Torpex water-bombs at 13.15 from an altitude of  to  which straddled U-156. Two bombs were observed to hit the water  to  starboard and just aft of U-156, lifting it and breaking it in two, followed by an explosion. At least eleven survivors were seen swimming in the water. The Americans dropped two rubber rafts and rations and five men were seen to reach one the rafts. The USS Barney was dispatched from Trinidad to rescue the survivors. The search was abandoned on 12 March 1943. Korvettenkapit&lt;U+00E4&gt;n Ernst Kals, chief of the 2nd U-boat Flotilla at Lorient, sent a letter to Werner Hartenstein's parents on the 23 April 1943 indicating that their son is missing in action as of 12 March 1943. The US officials announced the destruction of the U-boat on 10 May 1943.14
