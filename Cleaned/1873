Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations,2 Inuit3 and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis.4 The descriptors &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;Eskimo&quot; have fallen into disuse in Canada and are commonly considered pejorative.567 Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are some of the earliest archaeological sites of human habitation in Canada.8 The Paleo-Indian Clovis, Plano cultures and Pre-Dorset pre-date American indigenous and Inuit cultures. Projectile point tools, spears, pottery, bangles, chisels and scrapers mark archaeological sites, thus distinguishing cultural periods, traditions and lithic reduction styles.
The characteristics of Canadian Aboriginal civilizations included permanent settlements,9 agriculture,10 civic and ceremonial architecture,11 complex societal hierarchies and trading networks.12 The M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis culture of mixed blood originated in the mid-17th century when First Nation and native Inuit married European settlers.13 The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period.14 Various laws, treaties, and legislation have been enacted between European immigrants and First Nations across Canada. Aboriginal Right to Self-Government provides opportunity to manage historical, cultural, political, health care and economic control aspects within first people's communities.
As of the 2006 census, Aboriginal peoples in Canada totaled 1,172,790 people, or 3.8% of the national population, spread over 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands with distinctive cultures, languages, art, and music.1516 National Aboriginal Day recognises the cultures and contributions of Aboriginals to the history of Canada.17 First Nations, Inuit and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis peoples of all backgrounds have become prominent figures and have served as role models in the Aboriginal community and help to shape the Canadian cultural identity.18
Terminology
The terms First Peoples and First Nations are both used to refer to indigenous peoples of Canada.19 The terms First Peoples or Aboriginals in Canada are normally broader terms than First Nations, as they include Inuit, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis and First Nations. First Nations (most often used in the plural) has come into general use for the indigenous peoples of North America in Canada, and their descendants, who are neither Inuit nor M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis. On reserves, First Nations is being supplanted by members of various nations referring to themselves by their group or national identity. In conversation this would be &quot;I am Haida&quot;, or &quot;we are Kwantlens&quot;, in recognition of their First Nations ethnicities.20 In this Act, &quot;Aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot; includes the Indian, Inuit and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis peoples of Canada.21
Indian remains in place as the legal term used in the Canadian Constitution; its usage outside such situations can be considered offensive.22 Aboriginals is more commonly used to describe all indigenous peoples of Canada.23 It also refers to self-identification of aboriginal people who live within Canada claiming rights of sovereignty or aboriginal title to lands.
The term Eskimo has pejorative connotations in Canada and Greenland. Indigenous peoples have replaced the term Eskimo with Inuit.2425 The Yupik of Alaska and Siberia do not consider themselves Inuit, and ethnographers agree they are a distinct people.2627 They prefer the terminology Yupik, Yupiit, or Eskimo. The Yupik languages are linguistically distinct from the Inuit languages.28 Linguistic groups of Arctic people have no universal replacement term for Eskimo, inclusive of all Inuit and Yupik people across the geographical area inhabited by the Inuit and Yupik peoples.29
History
Paleo-Indians period
[maps of prehistoric America. (A) then gradual population expansion of the Amerind ancestors from their East Central Asian gene pool (blue arrow). (B) Proto-Amerind occupation of Beringia with little to no population growth for &lt;U+2248&gt;20,000 years. (C) Rapid colonization of the New World by a founder group migrating southward through the ice free, inland corridor between the eastern Laurentide and western Cordilleran Ice Sheets (green arrow) and/or along the Pacific coast (red arrow). In (B), the exposed seafloor is shown at its greatest extent during the last glacial maximum at &lt;U+2248&gt;20&lt;U+2013&gt;18 kya [25. In (A) and (C), the exposed seafloor is depicted at &lt;U+2248&gt;40 kya and &lt;U+2248&gt;16 kya, when prehistoric sea levels were comparable. A scaled-down version of Beringia today (60% reduction of A&lt;U+2013&gt;C) is presented in the lower left corner. This smaller map highlights the Bering Strait that has geographically separated the New World from Asia since &lt;U+2248&gt;11&lt;U+2013&gt;10 kya.&quot;|Maps depicting each phase of a three-step early human migrations for the peopling of the Americas.]] According to archaeological and genetic evidence, North and South America were the last continents in the world with human habitation.30 During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,00017,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska).31
 Alaska was ice-free because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.32
Aboriginal genetic studies suggest that the first inhabitants of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia.3334 The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,00020,000 years.353637 Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east into Canada and beyond.383940
The first inhabitants entered the Americas pursuing Pleistocene mammals such as the giant beaver, steppe wisent, musk ox, mastodons, woolly mammoths and ancient reindeer (early caribou).41 One route hypothesized is that people walked south by way of an ice-free corridor on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, and then fanned out across North America before continuing on to South America.42 The other conjectured route is that they migrated, either on foot or using primitive boats, down the Pacific Coast to the tip of South America, and then crossed the Rockies and Andes.43 Evidence of the latter has been covered by a sea level rise of hundreds of metres following the last ice age.4445
The Old Crow Flats and basin was one of the areas in Canada untouched by glaciations during the Pleistocene Ice ages, thus it served as a pathway and refuge for ice age plants and animals.46 The area holds evidence of early human habitation in Canada dating from about 20,000 years ago and ending about 11,000 years ago.4748 Fossils from the area include some never accounted for in North America, such as hyenas and large camels.49 Bluefish Caves is an archaeological site in the Yukon Territory of Canada from which a specimen of apparently human-worked mammoth bone has been radiocarbon dated to 18,000 years ago.5051
During the 1950s, geologists first conjectured that an ice-free corridor ran north and south through Alberta during the Late Wisconsin period.5253 Lithic reduction stone scrapers and choppers were preserved from archaeological sites in Grimshaw, Bow River, and Lethbridge.54 These Lithic flaked stone tools discovered under glacial sand and gravel are classified as pre-glacial and indicate nomadic humans occupied the area as early as 23,000 years ago.55 Archaeologists are still finalising the dates recorded for the Alberta and the Old Crow flats sites.5657  Clovis sites dated at 13,500 years ago were discovered in western North America during the 1930s. Clovis peoples were regarded as the first widespread Paleo-Indian inhabitants of the New World and ancestors to all indigenous peoples in the Americas.58 Archaeological discoveries in the past thirty years have brought forward other distinctive knapping cultures who occupied the Americas from the lower Great Plains to the shores of Chile.59
Localised regional cultures developed from the time of the Younger Dryas cold climate period from 12,900 to 11,500 years ago.60 The Folsom tradition are characterised by their use of Folsom points as projectile tips at archaeological sites. These tools assisted activities at kill sites that marked the slaughter and butchering of bison.61
The land bridge existed until 13,00011,000 years ago, long after the oldest proven human settlements in the New World began.62 Lower sea levels in the Queen Charlotte sound and Hecate Strait produced great grass lands called archipelago of Haida Gwaii.63 Hunter-gatherers of the area left distinctive lithic technology tools and the remains of large butchered mammals, occupying the area from 13,0009,000 years ago.64 In July 1992, the Federal Government officially designated X&lt;U+0332&gt;&lt;U+00E1&gt;:ytem as a National Historic Site, one of the first Indigenous spiritual sites in Canada to be formally recognised in this manner.65
The Plano culture was a group of hunter-gatherer communities that occupied the Great Plains area of North America between 12,00010,000 years ago.66 The Paleo-Indians moved into new territory as it emerged from under the glaciers. Big game flourished in this new environment.67 The Plano culture are characterised by a range of projectile point tools collectively called Plano points, which were used to hunt bison. Their diets also included pronghorn antelope, elk, deer, raccoon and coyote.68 At the beginning of the Archaic Era, they began to adopt a sedentary approach to subsistence.69 Sites in and around Belmont, Nova Scotia have evidence of Plano-Indians, indicating small seasonal hunting camps, perhaps re-visited over generations from around 11,00010,000 years ago.70 Seasonal large and smaller game fish and fowl were food and raw material sources. Adaptation to the harsh environment included tailored clothing and skin-covered tents on wooden frames.71 
Archaic period
The North American climate stabilized by 8000 BCE (10,000 years ago); climatic conditions were very similar to today's.72 This led to widespread migration, cultivation and later a dramatic rise in population all over the Americas.73 Over the course of thousands of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50 &lt;U+2013&gt; 60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.74  The vastness and variety of Canada's climates, ecology, vegetation, fauna, and landform separations have defined ancient peoples implicitly into cultural or linguistic divisions. Canada is surrounded north, east, and west with coastline and since the last ice age, Canada has consisted of distinct forest regions. Language contributes to the identity of a people by influencing social life ways and spiritual practices.75 Aboriginal religions developed from anthropomorphism and animism philosophies.76
The placement of artifacts and materials within an Archaic burial site indicated social differentiation based upon status.77 There is a continuous record of occupation of S'&lt;U+00F3&gt;lh T&lt;U+00E9&gt;m&lt;U+00E9&gt;xw by Aboriginal people dating from the early Holocene period, 10,0009,000 years ago.78 Archaeological sites at Stave Lake, Coquitlam Lake, Fort Langley and region uncovered early period artifacts. These early inhabitants were highly mobile hunter-gatherers, consisting of about 20 to 50 members of an extended family.7980 The Na-Dene people occupied much of the land area of northwest and central North America starting around 8,000 BCE.81 They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabaskan-speaking peoples, including the Navajo and Apache. They had villages with large multi-family dwellings, used seasonally during the summer, from which they hunted, fished and gathered food supplies for the winter.82 The Wendat peoples settled into Southern Ontario along the Eramosa River around 8,0007,000 BCE (10,0009,000 years ago).83 They were concentrated between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay. Wendat hunted caribou to survive on the glacier-covered land.84 Many different First Nations cultures relied upon the buffalo starting by 6,0005,000 BCE (8,0007,000 years ago).85 They hunted buffalo by herding migrating buffalo off cliffs. Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, near Lethbridge, Alberta, is a hunting grounds that was in use for about 5,000 years.86  The west coast of Canada by 7,0005000 BCE (9,0007,000 years ago) saw various cultures who organised themselves around salmon fishing.87 The Nuu-chah-nulth of Vancouver Island began whaling with advanced long spears at about this time.88 The Maritime Archaic is one group of North America's Archaic culture of sea-mammal hunters in the subarctic. They prospered from approximately 7,000 BCE1,500 BCE (9,0003,500 years ago) along the Atlantic Coast of North America.89 Their settlements included longhouses and boat-topped temporary or seasonal houses. They engaged in long-distance trade, using as currency white chert, a rock quarried from northern Labrador to Maine.90 The Pre-Columbian culture, whose members were called Red Paint People, is indigenous to the New England and Atlantic Canada regions of North America. The culture flourished between 3,000 BCE1,000 BCE (5,0003,000 years ago) and was named after their burial ceremonies, which used large quantities of red ochre to cover bodies and grave goods.91
The Arctic small tool tradition is a broad cultural entity that developed along the Alaska Peninsula, around Bristol Bay, and on the eastern shores of the Bering Strait around 2,500 BCE (4,500 years ago).92 These Paleo-Arctic peoples had a highly distinctive toolkit of small blades (microblades) that were pointed at both ends and used as side- or end-barbs on arrows or spears made of other materials, such as bone or antler. Scrapers, engraving tools and adze blades were also included in their toolkits.93 The Arctic small tool tradition branches off into two cultural variants, including the Pre-Dorset, and the Independence traditions. These two groups, ancestors of Thule people, were displaced by the Inuit by 1000 Common Era (CE).94

The Woodland cultural period dates from about 2,000 BCE1,000 CE, and has locales in Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime regions.97 The introduction of pottery distinguishes the Woodland culture from the earlier Archaic stage inhabitants. Laurentian people of southern Ontario manufactured the oldest pottery excavated to date in Canada.98 They created pointed-bottom beakers decorated by a cord marking technique that involved impressing tooth implements into wet clay. Woodland technology included items such as beaver incisor knives, bangles, and chisels. The population practicing sedentary agricultural life ways continued to increase on a diet of squash, corn, and bean crops.99
The Hopewell tradition is an Aboriginal culture that flourished along American rivers from 300 BCE500 CE. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell Exchange System networked cultures and societies with the peoples on the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Canadian expression of the Hopewellian peoples encompasses the Point Peninsula, Saugeen, and Laurel complexes.100101102
First Nations
 First Nations peoples had settled and established trade routes across what is now Canada by 500 BCE1,000 CE. Communities developed each with its own culture, customs, and character.103 In the northwest were the Athapaskan, Slavey, Dogrib, Tutchone, and Tlingit. Along the Pacific coast were the Tsimshian;Haida; Salish; Kwakiutl; Nootka; Nisga'a; Senakw and Gitxsan. In the plains were the Blackfoot; K&lt;U+00E1&gt;&lt;U+00ED&gt;nawa; Sarcee and Peigan. In the northern woodlands were the Cree and Chipewyan. Around the Great Lakes were the Anishinaabe; Algonquin; M&lt;U+00ED&gt;kmaq; Iroquois and Huron. Along the Atlantic coast were the Beothuk, Maliseet, Innu, Abenaki and Mi'kmaq.
Many Canadian Aboriginal civilisations established characteristics and hallmarks that included permanent or urban settlements, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies.104 These civilisations had evolved and changed by the time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th&lt;U+2013&gt;early 16th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations.105
There are indications of contact made before Christopher Columbus between the first peoples and those from other continents. Aboriginal people in Canada interacted with Europeans around 1000 CE, but prolonged contact came after Europeans established permanent settlements in the 17th and 18th centuries.106 In Columbus' time there was speculation that other Europeans had made the trip in ancient or contemporary times; Gonzalo Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez de Oviedo y Vald&lt;U+00E9&gt;s records in his General y natural historia de las Indias of 1526, which includes biographical information on Columbus.107 European written accounts generally recorded friendliness of the First Nations, who profited in trade with Europeans.108 Such trade generally strengthened the more organised political entities such as the Iroquois Confederation.109 Throughout the 16th century, European fleets made almost annual visits to the eastern shores of Canada to cultivate the fishing opportunities. A sideline industry emerged in the un-organised traffic of furs overseen by the Indian Department.110
Prominent First Nations people include Joe Capilano, who met with King of the United Kingdom, Edward VII, to speak of the need to settle land claims and Ovide Mercredi, a leader at both the Meech Lake Accord constitutional reform discussions and Oka Crisis.111112
Inuit
The Inuit are the descendants of what anthropologists call the Thule culture, which emerged from western Alaska around 1,000 CE and spread eastward across the Arctic, displacing the Dorset culture (in Inuktitut, the Tuniit). Inuit historically referred to the Tuniit as &quot;giants&quot;, or &quot;dwarfs&quot;, who were taller and stronger than the Inuit.113114 Researchers hypothesize that the Dorset culture lacked dogs, larger weapons and other technologies used by the expanding Inuit society.115 By 1300, the Inuit had settled in west Greenland, and finally moved into east Greenland over the following century. The Inuit had trade routes with more southern cultures. Boundary disputes were common and led to aggressive actions.116  Warfare was common among Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit, such as the Nunatamiut (Uummarmiut) who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in common warfare. The Central Arctic Inuit lacked the population density to engage in warfare. In the 13th century, the Thule culture began arriving in Greenland from what is now Canada. Norse accounts are scant. Norse-made items from Inuit campsites in Greenland were obtained by either trade or plunder.117 One account, &lt;U+00CD&gt;var B&lt;U+00E1&gt;r&lt;U+00F0&gt;arson, speaks of &quot;small people&quot; with whom the Norsemen fought.118 14th-century accounts that a western settlement, one of the two Norse settlements, was taken over by the Skr&lt;U+00E6&gt;ling.119
After the disappearance of the Norse colonies in Greenland, the Inuit had no contact with Europeans for at least a century. By the mid-16th century, Basque fishers were already working the Labrador coast and had established whaling stations on land, such as been excavated at Red Bay.120 The Inuit appear not to have interfered with their operations, but they did raid the stations in winter for tools, and particularly worked iron, which they adapted to native needs.121
Notable among the Inuit are Abraham Ulrikab and family who became a zoo exhibit in Hamburg, Germany, and Tanya Tagaq, a traditional throat singer.122 Abe Okpik, CM, was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers and Kiviaq (David Ward) won the legal right to use his single-word Inuktituk name.123124
M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis
 The M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis are a people descended from marriages between Europeans (mainly French125) and Cree, Ojibway, Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi'kmaq, Maliseet, and other First Nations.126 Their history dates to the mid-17th century.127 The M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis homeland consists of the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Ontario, as well as the Northwest Territories (NWT).128
Amongst notable M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis people are Tom Jackson,129 television actor, Tony Whitford, Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, and Louis Riel who led two resistance movements: the Red River Rebellion of 1869&lt;U+2013&gt;1870 and the North-West Rebellion of 1885, which ended in his trial.130131132133134
The languages inherently M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis are either M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis French or a mixed language called Michif. Michif, Mechif or M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tchif is a phonetic spelling of M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tif, a variant of M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis.135 The M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis today predominantly speak English, with French a strong second language, as well as numerous Aboriginal tongues. A 19th-century community of the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis people, the Anglo-M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis, were referred to as Countryborn. They were children of Rupert's Land fur trade typically of Orcadian, Scottish, or English paternal descent and Aboriginal maternal descent.136 Their first languages would have been Aboriginal (Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc.) and English. Their fathers spoke Gaelic, thus leading to the development of an English dialect referred to as &quot;Bungee&quot;.137
There is debate over legally defining the term M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis.138 Unlike First Nations people and Inuit, there is no distinction between status and non-status.139 S.35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 mentions the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis, their heritage and aboriginal ancestry have been absorbed and assimilated into their surrounding populations.140 On September 23, 2003, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis are a distinct people with significant rights (Powley ruling).141
Integration
  From the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged Aboriginals to assimilate into their own culture, referred to as &quot;Canadian culture&quot;.142143 These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration. Because of laws and policies that encouraged or required Aboriginals to assimilate into a Eurocentric society, Canada may be violating the United Nations Genocide Convention that Canada signed in 1949 and passed through Parliament in 1952.144 The residential school system that removed Aboriginal children from their homes for placement in Christian-run schools has led scholars to believe that Canada can be tried in international court for genocide.145 In 2008 Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an apology on behalf of the Canadian government and its citizens for the residential school system.146
Politics, law and legislation
Treaties
 The Canadian Crown and Aboriginal peoples began interactions during the European colonialisation period. Numbered treaties, the Indian Act, the Constitution Act of 1982 and case laws were established. Aboriginals construe these agreements as being between them and the Crown of Canada through the districts Indian Agent, and not the Cabinet of Canada.147 The M&lt;U+0101&gt;ori interprets the Treaty of Waitangi in New Zealand similarly.148 A series of eleven treaties were signed between Aboriginals in Canada and the reigning Monarch of Canada from 1871 to 1921. The Government of Canada created the policy, commissioned the Treaty Commissioners and ratified the agreements. These Treaties are agreements with the Government of Canada administered by Canadian Aboriginal law and overseen by the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.149
According to the First Nations&lt;U+2013&gt; Federal Crown Political Accord &quot;cooperation will be a cornerstone for partnership between Canada and First Nations, wherein Canada is the short-form reference to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.150 The Supreme Court argued that treaties &quot;served to reconcile pre-existing Aboriginal sovereignty with assumed Crown sovereignty, and to define Aboriginal rights&quot;.151 First Nations people interpreted agreements covered in treaty 8 to last &quot;as long as the sun shines, grass grows and rivers flow.&quot;152 
Indian Act and Bill C-31
 The Indian Act is federal legislation that dates from 1876. There have been over twenty major changes made to the original Act since then, the last time being in 1951; amended in 1985 with Bill C-31. The Indian Act indicates how Reserves and Bands can operate and defines who is recognised as an &quot;Indian&quot;.153
In 1985, the Canadian Parliament passed Bill C-31, &quot;An Act to Amend the Indian Act&quot;. Because of a Constitutional requirement, the Bill took effect as of April 17, 1985.154
It ends discriminatory provisions of the Indian Act, especially those that discriminated against women.155
It changes the meaning of &quot;status&quot; and for the first time allows for limited reinstatement of Indians who were denied or lost status and/or Band membership.156
It allows bands to define their own membership rules.157
Those people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians. C-31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to band members. The sections under debate concern community life and land holdings. Sections pertaining to Indians (Aboriginals) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included.158 
Royal Commission
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was a Royal Commission undertaken by the Government of Canada in 1991 to address issues of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada.159 It assessed past government policies toward Aboriginal people, such as residential schools, and provided policy recommendations to the government.160 The Commission issued its final report in November 1996. The five-volume, 4,000page report covered a vast range of issues; its 440 recommendations called for sweeping changes to the interaction between Aboriginal, non-Aboriginal people and the governments in Canada.161 The report &quot;set out a 20year agenda for change.&quot;162
Health policy
In 1995, the federal government announced the Aboriginal Right to Self-Government Policy.163 This policy recognises that First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances. The Indian Health Transfer Policy provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by Aboriginal peoples, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on self-determination in health.164165 Through this process, the decision to enter transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities can take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.166 The National Aboriginal Health Organization (NAHO) incorporated in 2000, is an Aboriginal-designed and-controlled not-for-profit body in Canada that works to influence and advance the health and well-being of Aboriginal Peoples.167
Political organization
First Nations and Inuit organisations ranged in size from band societies of a few people to multi-nation confederacies like the Iroquois. First Nations leaders from across the country formed the Assembly of First Nations, which began as the National Indian Brotherhood in 1968.168
Today's political organisations have resulted from interaction with European-style methods of government through the Federal Interlocutor for M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis and Non-Status Indians. Aboriginal political organisations throughout Canada vary in political standing, viewpoints, and reasons for forming.169 First Nations, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis and Inuit negotiate with the Canadian Government through Indian and Northern Affairs Canada in all affairs concerning land, entitlement, and rights.170 The First Nation groups that operate independently do not belong to these groups.171
Culture
Further information: Aboriginal culture in Canada and Aboriginal Canadian personalities
 Countless North American Indigenous words, inventions and games have become an everyday part of Canadian language and use. The canoe, snowshoes, the toboggan, lacrosse, tug of war, maple syrup and tobacco are just a few of the products, inventions and games.172 Some of the words include the barbecue, caribou, chipmunk, woodchuck, hammock, skunk, mahogany, hurricane and moose.173 Many North American and South American areas, towns, cities and rivers have names of Indigenous origin. The word &quot;Canada&quot; derives from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;.174 The province of Saskatchewan derives its name from the Saskatchewan River; which in the Cree language is called &quot;Kisiskatchewani Sipi&quot;, meaning &quot;swift-flowing river.&quot;175 Canada's capital city Ottawa comes from the Algonquin language term &quot;adawe&quot; meaning &quot;to trade.&quot;176 Modern youth groups such as Scouts Canada and the Girl Guides of Canada include programs based largely on Indigenous lore, arts and crafts, character building and outdoor camp craft and living.177
Aboriginal cultural areas depend upon their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, at the time of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada.178 The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash.179 While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet.180 The caribou, fish, other marine mammals and to a lesser extent plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.181  Indian reserves, established in Canadian law by treaties such as Treaty 7, are lands of First Nations recognised by non-indigenous governments.182 Some reserves are within cities, such as the Opawikoscikan Reserve in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, Wendake in Quebec City or Stony Plain 135 in the Edmonton Capital Region. There are more reserves in Canada than there are First Nations, which were ceded multiple reserves by treaty.183 Aboriginal people currently work in a variety of occupations and may live outside their ancestral homes. The traditional cultures of their ancestors, shaped by nature, still exert a strong influence on them, from spirituality to political attitudes.184 National Aboriginal Day is a day of recognition of the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis peoples of Canada. The day was first celebrated in 1996, after it was proclaimed that year, by then Governor General of Canada Rom&lt;U+00E9&gt;o LeBlanc, to be celebrated on June 21 annually.185 Most provincial jurisdictions do not recognise it as a statutory holiday.186

There are 11 Aboriginal language groups in Canada, made up of more than 65 distinct dialects.187 Of these, only Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term.188 Two of Canada's territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.189 In the NWT, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich&lt;U+2019&gt;in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and T&lt;U+0142&gt;&lt;U+012F&gt;ch&lt;U+01EB&gt;.190 Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.191

Art
  Aboriginals were producing art for thousands of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state. Like the peoples who produced them, indigenous art traditions spanned territories across North America. Indigenous art traditions are organised by art historians according to cultural, linguistic or regional groups: Northwest Coast, Plateau, Plains, Eastern Woodlands, Subarctic, and Arctic.192
Art traditions vary enormously amongst and within these diverse groups. Indigenous art with a focus on portability and the body is distinguished from European traditions and its focus on architecture. Indigenous visual art may be used conjunction with other arts. Shamans' masks and rattles are used ceremoniously in dance, storytelling and music.193 Artworks preserved in museum collections date from the period after European contact and show evidence of the creative adoption and adaptation of European trade goods such as metal and glass beads.194 The distinct M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis cultures that have arisen from inter-cultural relationships with Europeans contribute culturally hybrid art forms.195 During the 19th and the first half of the 20th century the Canadian government pursued an active policy of forced and cultural assimilation toward indigenous peoples. The Indian Act banned manifestations of the Sun Dance, the Potlatch, and works of art depicting them.196
It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that indigenous artists such as Mungo Martin, Bill Reid and Norval Morrisseau began to publicly renew and re-invent indigenous art traditions. Currently there are indigenous artists practicing in all media in Canada and two indigenous artists, Edward Poitras and Rebecca Belmore have represented Canada at the Venice Biennale in 1995 and 2005 respectively.197

Music
The Aboriginal peoples of Canada encompass diverse ethnic groups with their individual musical traditions. Music is usually social (public) or ceremonial (private). Public, social music may be dance music accompanied by rattles and drums. Private, ceremonial music includes vocal songs with accompaniment on percussion, used to mark occasions like Midewivin ceremonies and Sun Dances.
Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples used the materials at hand to make their instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada.198 First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted.199 In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides.200 These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.201202
Demographics
 There are three distinctive groups of North America indigenous peoples recognized in the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, sections 25 and 35.203 Under the Employment Equity Act, Aboriginal people are a designated group along with women, visible minorities, and persons with disabilities.204 They are not a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act and in the view of Statistics Canada.205
The 2006 Canadian Census enumerated 1,172,790 Aboriginal people in Canada, 3.8% of the country's total population.206 This total comprises 698,025 people of First Nations descent, 389,785 M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis, and 50,485 Inuit. National representative bodies of Aboriginal people in Canada include the Assembly of First Nations, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis National Council, the Native Women's Association of Canada, the National Association of Native Friendship Centres and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples.207
Indigenous people assert that their sovereign rights are valid, and point to the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which is mentioned in the Canadian Constitution Act, 1982, Section 25, the British North America Acts and the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (to which Canada is a signatory) in support of this claim.208209

C.According to Statistics Canada this figure &quot;Includes those who identified themselves as Registered Indians and/or band members without identifying themselves as North American Indian, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tis or Inuit in the Aboriginal identity question.&quot;211
 Ethnographers commonly classify indigenous peoples of the Americas in the United States and Canada into ten geographical regions, cultural areas, with shared cultural traits.212 The Canadian regions are:
Arctic cultural area &lt;U+2013&gt; (Eskimo&lt;U+2013&gt;Aleut languages)
Subarctic culture area &lt;U+2013&gt; (Na-Dene languages &lt;U+2013&gt; Algic languages)
Eastern Woodlands (Northeast) cultural area &lt;U+2013&gt; (Algic languages and Iroquoian languages)
Plains cultural area &lt;U+2013&gt; (Siouan&lt;U+2013&gt;Catawban languages)
Northwest Plateau cultural area &lt;U+2013&gt; (Salishan languages)
Northwest Coast cultural area &lt;U+2013&gt; (Penutian languages, Tsimshianic languages and Wakashan languages)
In the 20th century the Aboriginal population of Canada increased tenfold.213 Between 1900 and 1950 the population grew by 29%. After the 1960s the infant mortality level on reserves dropped dramatically and the population grew by 161%.214215 Since the 1980s the number of First Nations babies more than doubled and currently almost half of the First Nations population is under the age of 25.216217
