The government and people of Niger observe thirteen official public holidays. These include international commemorations, the commemoration of important dates in the history of Niger, and religious holidays. Both Christian and Muslim holidays are observed as official public holidays. While the former colonial power, France, instituted Christian observances, the vast majority of Nigeriens are Muslim.
Because Muslim holiday are dependent on the Islamic calendar, and -- like Christian Easter -- move from year to year. Some Muslim holidays are also dependent upon astronomical sightings (e.g.: the observance of moonrise for Ramadan. National commemorations and secular international holidays are fixed on the Gregorian calendar, the standard civil calendar used in Niger as most of the world.
