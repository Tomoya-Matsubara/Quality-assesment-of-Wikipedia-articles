WTMJ-TV, virtual channel 4.1 (digital channel 28) and branded as &quot;Today's TMJ4&quot;, is the NBC-affiliated television station located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It serves as the flagship station of the Journal Broadcast Group, and is one of several flagship media properties owned by Journal Communications, which also owns the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and radio stations WTMJ (620 AM) and WLWK-FM (94.5). The station's studios located on Capitol Drive in Milwaukee (this Art Deco facility is known as &quot;Radio City&quot; in tribute to the New York complex of the same name), with its transmitter located directly to its north at approximately  north of downtown Milwaukee.
The station also provides engineering assistance for Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXE-TV (channel 55); previously WPXE aired WTMJ newscasts on a half-hour delay in the evening and shared some programming with Channel 4, however this news share agreement was ended in July 2005.
History
The Journal Company's first television license was granted in September 1931 for experimental station W9XD, using a low-definition electromechanical system. The station conducted field tests from 1931 to 1933, before converting its facilities to experimental high-fidelity apex radio unit W9XAZ in 1934. Its license was withdrawn by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1938 as part of an effort to limit licenses to stations actively engaging in the development of television. No publicly announced television programming was broadcast by W9XD during this experimental period.
The Journal Company obtained one of the first commercial television construction permits issued by the FCC on December 7, 1941, under the call letters WMJT (standing for &quot;Milwaukee Journal Television&quot;), and built a new broadcast facility by August 1942. But the U.S. War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio broadcasting equipment for civilian use from April 1942 to August 1945, suspending the company's television plans.
On December 3, 1947, WTMJ-TV (referencing The Milwaukee Journal) went on the air, becoming the first commercial television station in Wisconsin, the fourth commercial station in the Midwest and the fifteenth commercial station to go on the air in the United States. When the station began broadcasting in 1947, there were only 500 television sets in Milwaukee, jumping to 2,050 by the following April.1 WTMJ had affiliated with the NBC television network since sign on, although it also carried programming from CBS, ABC and DuMont, before those networks had their own affiliated stations in Milwaukee.2 WTMJ is the only station in Milwaukee to be affiliated with the same network since it signed on. It is currently NBC's second-longest tenured affiliate, behind only KSD-TV (now KSDK) in St. Louis (which had signed on in January of that year).
WTMJ originally broadcast on VHF channel 3 and moved to channel 4 on July 11, 1953 to avoid interference with Kalamazoo, Michigan's WKZO-TV (now WWMT), which is nearly directly across Lake Michigan. This was a part of the FCC's complete revision of the Table of Channel Assignments as issued in its Sixth Report and General Order issued on April 14, 1952. This move forced the CBS affiliate on channel 4 in Chicago (now WBBM-TV), the first commercially-licensed television station outside of the Eastern Time Zone to move to channel 2, doing so on July 5, 1953.
WTMJ was one of the first stations in the country to purchase color equipment, and in December 1953, it broadcast the color television program Amahl and the Night Visitors from NBC, when only two prototype color sets existed in Milwaukee. The city's first color television sets were sold in March 1954, and by July 1954 WTMJ broadcast its first local color program originating from its studios, The Grenadiers, becoming the third local station in the U.S. with live color capability.3 By November 1, 1956, all locally produced WTMJ-TV programs were in color. About 3000 color sets existed in Milwaukee in February 1957.
On April 7, 2009, WTMJ became the first station in Milwaukee, and the second in Wisconsin (behind WISC-TV in Madison) to begin broadcasting its newscasts and other local programs in high definition. It began with a soft launch starting with that day's Live at Daybreak newscast.4
Journal Broadcast Group continues to own WTMJ-TV to this day. As such, WTMJ is one of the few television stations in the country that is not a network-owned station that has had the same callsign, owner and primary network affiliation throughout its history. In addition, it is the only station in the Milwaukee market to have never switched its primary network affiliation in its history. In August 2004, Green Bay's NBC affiliate, WGBA-TV (channel 26), was purchased by Journal and became a sister station to WTMJ, along with LMA partner WACY-TV.

WTMJ-DT2 (Storm Team 4 TV)
On March 1, 2006, WTMJ launched its local version of the NBC Weather Plus service called TMJ4 Weather Plus, a 24-hour weather channel which featured a mix of local/national current conditions and forecasts along with local weather updates from WTMJ's meteorologists. The station is carried on digital channel 4.2, and on Time Warner digital cable channel 999 throughout Southeastern Wisconsin under an exclusivity agreement which precludes Charter Communications, the other main local cable provider, to carry it or TheCoolTV. In June 2006, the station changed its weather branding on the main newscasts from &quot;Storm Team 4&quot; to &quot;TMJ4 Weather Plus&quot;, as had most NBC stations airing the service. With the Weather Plus service being discontinued in November 2008, the weather branding has returned to using the former &quot;Storm Team 4&quot; name; the subchannel also took on the same branding as the Storm Team 4 Channel on January 1, later with be renamed &quot;Storm Team 4 TV&quot;. As of mid-December 2009, Storm Team 4 TV no longer uses the Weather Plus system, switching to national programming and graphics software from The Local AccuWeather Channel.
WTMJ-DT3
WTMJ began carrying TheCoolTV on 4.3 in early July 2009, becoming the first full-power station to carry the network as a digital subchannel; it later was carried by stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and LIN TV, and in November 2010 by WTMJ's Green Bay sister station WGBA. The station featured music videos and concert programming which was customized by WTMJ. TheCoolTV was co-branded with WTMJ-TV's FM radio sister, WLWK-FM, which airs a random music format.
In September 2011, Journal Communications filed a $257,000 lawsuit against TheCoolTV's owners Cool Music Network, LLC, alleging non-payment of broadcast services since before June 2011.5 Because of this, Journal decided to replace TheCoolTV with the Live Well Network on October 1, while WGBA's TheCoolTV subchannel was replaced with Me-TV.67 On WTMJ, Live Well airs in 480i widescreen optimized for 16:9 displays, and limited LWN programming appears in high definition during late night weekend slots on the main WTMJ schedule.
Analog-to-digital conversion
As part of the analog television shutdown and digital conversion, WTMJ-TV shut down its analog transmitter on June 12, 2009 at 12 noon (with a short two-hour nightlighting period after), and continued to broadcast on its pre-transition digital channel 28.8 However, through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers currently display WTMJ-TV's virtual channel as 4.
Programming
WTMJ broadcasts all of NBC's schedule, with the exception of some older made-for-TV movies bought by Channel 4 which are used to pre-empt NBC movies or Saturday night programming for additional local advertising revenue several times a year. However, this practice is nothing new, as it also had a reputation of pre-empting or delaying a handful of NBC shows from the 1960s to the 1990s (examples includes the preemptions of NBC's daytime gameshow and soap opera lineup, moving Sanford and Son to Saturday nights in the 1970s and airing the syndicated Fame in place of Gimme a Break! and Mama's Family on Thursday nights during the 1983-1984 season). But its most controversial move would come in 1979 when it asked NBC permission to delay The Tonight Show to 11 p.m., so it could carry reruns of Maude. It tried again in 1984, attempting to ask for a Tonight Show move to 11:30 p.m., in order to air reruns of Trapper John, M.D. after the late news starting that September. NBC refused again, and the program was moved to then-independent WVTV (channel 18), where it aired at 10:30 p.m. from September 1984 to September 1988, when WTMJ decided to cede to NBC and air the program at its regular time. The station also delayed Late Night with Conan O'Brien to 12:05 a.m. from the program's 1993 debut to 2001.
WTMJ decided to pre-empt the entire run of the primetime poker game show Face the Ace in August 2009, replacing the series with paid programming, the first time any Milwaukee station has preempted a significant portion or all of an entire primetime network series since the early 1990s. It is unknown if moral objections by WTMJ management (as sister station WGBA carried the series) or ratings concerns played into the pre-emption.
Generally, the station does not air NBC programming preempted due to breaking news besides Days of Our Lives, as seen in February 2013 when coverage of a snowstorm preempted an episode of Do No Harm which was not rescheduled. Also, NBC programs seen in All Night late night block and Saturday morning Kids block, which are tape-delayed, are not shown in HD.
The station's sole syndicated programs are Access Hollywood and Access Hollywood Live on weekdays and late weekend evenings, Comedy.tv after Saturday Night Live, Hispanic Business Today, and Alliant Energy Powerhouse, making WTMJ by far the station with the lowest amount of syndicated programming in the market. WTMJ had been the long-time Milwaukee home for Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! from their premieres in the early 1980s until fall 2005, when both shows moved to WDJT-TV, and was the first station to air Oprah until an group-wide deal with Hearst's television stations in 1994 moved the show to WISN. WTMJ (and WPXE during the LMA years) had aired Martha Stewart Living and then Martha until September 2007, when the latter program moved to WISN.
Currently WTMJ airs Today in two segments; the original 7-9 a.m. block, followed by The Morning Blend, then the final two hours of Today from 10 a.m.-noon, leading into the relocated hour-long noon newscast and Days of Our Lives, which moved to 1 p.m. on September 10, 2007. The station also provides a pre-game news segment, and pre-game and post-game &quot;ride home&quot; weather segments to the Milwaukee Brewers, which are carried on the scoreboard of Miller Park.
Green Bay Packers partnership
The station has been the 'official station' of the Green Bay Packers for the Milwaukee market since the mid-1990s, giving it rights to air the team's non-nationally televised preseason games, which since March 2012 will be shared with sister station WGBA in Green Bay, in addition to KMTV-TV in Omaha and the existing statewide network.9 WTMJ airs shows involving the team, including the head coach's weekly show, which airs Tuesday nights at 6:30. As part of the new broadcast agreement, Packers Radio Network color commentator Larry McCarren (who resigned as sports director of Green Bay's WFRV-TV in March 2012) now also works for WTMJ and WGBA as a Packer analyst, and does his segments during the sports department's Packers Extra segment from the WTMJ set.
Because of the Summer Olympic Games occurring in 2004 and 2008, which are not allowed any pre-emptions by the network, WTMJ has sub-licenced some preseason games to other stations; in 2004 to then-LMA partner WPXE, and in 2008 to CW affiliate WVTV (channel 18). In 2012, the opening pre-season game against the Chargers during the Olympics was an ESPN national broadcast carried by WISN which averted the need for sub-licensing any games that season.
The Morning Blend
The station produces a locally-produced program called The Morning Blend, which premiered on September 12, 2006 at 10 a.m., and now airs at 9 a.m. after Today's expansion to four hours. The show is hosted by Tiffany Ogle and former WITI morning news anchor Molly Fay. Original co-host Alison de Castro (who originally reported for WISN) left the program in October 2009 due to a family move to Chicago, and Ogle (a Miss Minnesota 2004 and former commercial actress) took over co-hosting duties with Molly Fay. This was WTMJ's first attempt at a local show besides news or public affairs since 1979, when the short-lived A New Day aired, co-hosted by 1973 Miss Wisconsin/Miss America winner (and current The 700 Club co-host) Terry Meeuwsen and news anchor/radio host (and former WTMJ-TV reporter) Pete Wilson (now deceased).10
The format for &quot;The Morning Blend&quot; was derived from WFLA-TV in Tampa's Daytime program, one of the first shows to launch this morning program format. WTMJ's version features a mix of paid and unpaid segments; all segments which promote a certain product or company have clear on-air disclaimers. The show is produced by the WTMJ's sales and advertising departments, with no connections whatsoever to the news department. As such, the hosts of The Morning Blend do not report any news, ceding any breaking events to the station's news staff, and the show is preempted in cases where breaking news or severe weather coverage takes up the entire hour.11 In June 2008, the program also began airing on Green Bay sister station WGBA, also at 9 a.m., after that station cut back its morning news programming; WGBA has since replaced The Morning Blend with syndicated programs.
The format and Morning Blend branding has since been adapted by several other Journal stations; Fox sister station WFTX-TV in Fort Myers-Naples, Florida in mid-2009, and in late April 2010 on two additional sister stations, ABC affiliate KGUN-TV in Tucson, Arizona (airing weekdays at 11 a.m.) and on CBS affiliate KMTV in Omaha, Nebraska (airing weekdays at 9 a.m). KTNV-TV in Las Vegas premiered its version of the show in early July 2010.
News operation
WTMJ presently broadcasts 40&lt;U+00BD&gt; hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours on weekdays, three hours on Saturdays and 2&lt;U+00BD&gt; hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the second-highest newscast output in the Milwaukee market and the state of Wisconsin (behind Fox affiliate WITI). WTMJ-TV is one of the very few Big Three stations in the United States to produce 35 hours or more of local newscasts each week. The station maintains a news and weather content agreement with its associated radio stations; WTMJ radio and WLWK-FM (which both based at Radio City with WTMJ-TV), also partners with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the newspaper which founded the station, with news stories seen in the Journal Sentinel and to provide weather forecasts; as such, the station maintains an auxiliary studio in the newspaper's State Street headquarters and is used for a regular segment called &quot;JSOnAir&quot;, which is featured during the station's 3 p.m. newscast. WTMJ is also one of ten television stations that air consumer reports from John Matarese of ABC affiliate WCPO in Cincinnati.
Since the launch of the extended Today Show in September 2007, the station's programming focus has shifted very heavily towards local news, as replacement syndicated programming for Martha, Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! after their moves to other stations in the market, and Montel's August 2008 departure from syndication have failed to spark viewer interest outside of local/network hours. On August 25, 2008, the station extended the 6 p.m. newscast to a full hour (except Tuesday nights for Mike McCarthy's coach's show during the NFL season) before NBC primetime with the move of Extra to WITI; this was followed on September 8 by the debut of an hour-long newscast at 3 p.m.12
The station dropped the 6:30 p.m. newscast on April 11, 2011, replacing it with Access Hollywood, which moved to WTMJ from WISN after that station began airing an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast in January 2011. A consequence of this was WISN moving longtime 10:30 p.m. slotholder Access Hollywood to 12:30 a.m., the program's distributor NBCUniversal Television Distribution asked for an early release from their contract so that the show could move to the earlier timeslot on WTMJ. Access previously aired on WTMJ at 11:35 p.m. from its 1995 debut, until the move of Conan to the network mandated slot in 2000.13 The 6:30 p.m. newscast was reinstated on February 4, 2013; Access Hollywood then moved to 1:35 a.m.14 The second 6:30 p.m. effort is a magazine/feature format titled Wisconsin Tonight.
&quot;Wisconsin on Demand 411&quot;, a video on demand service offered to Time Warner Cable subscribers throughout southeastern Wisconsin, carries the station's morning, 6 and 10 p.m. newscasts starting two hours after each program's original broadcast and for three days afterward; along with certain WTMJ news reports, &quot;I-Team&quot; investigations, consumer stories, and the public affairs program Sunday Insight with Charlie Sykes, a Sunday morning &quot;week in review&quot; debate program featuring the WTMJ radio host which follows Meet the Press. The station also utilizes and promotes Time Warner Cable's Start Over for its locally-based and select local programs, allowing viewers to restart a program from the beginning if they tune in late in a program.
Some of WTMJ's morning and noon newscasts were simulcast on Green Bay sister station WGBA-TV beginning on July 14, 2008, after that station ended its own newscasts at 5 and 9 a.m., and cut the first half-hour of its noon newscast. The simulcast ended in early 2009, due to viewer disinterest in Milwaukee-focused news. The station also began to provide forecasts to that station during its weekend newscasts. Until April 2013, when Larry McCarren became WGBA's sports director, all sportscasts were provided by WTMJ, though weekend sports continued to be provided from Milwaukee; station staff continues to film video and freelance announcers (some formerly with WGBA) provide commentary for Green Bay sporting events on WGBA and WACY. WGBA relaunched a local morning newscast in January 2011.
On April 7, 2009, WTMJ began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. With the change to HD came new music (High Velocity from 615 Music) and new graphics from Renderon Broadcast Design, the main graphics company for all Journal Broadcast Group stations.15 Studio shots and recorded remote video are in the format, while two of the station's live units are equipped for the format, with the remainder of the news equipment, &quot;Chopper 4&quot;, and the station's skycam system outputting in digital widescreen upconverted for HD broadcast. On August 13, 2012, WTMJ moved all newscasts from Studio A to a temporary set in Studio D, with the new set in Studio A being launched on September 9, 2012 during the 5 p.m. newscast.
News/station presentation
WTMJ was formerly known as &quot;News 4 Milwaukee&quot;, and then shortened down to &quot;News 4&quot;, with the late news known as &quot;News 4 Tonight at 10&quot;. The newscast name was changed to &quot;Newschannel 4&quot; from 1990 until July 1992, when the &quot;Today's TMJ4&quot; imaging was inaugurated during coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The first generation of the branding lasted until July 2004 and the 2004 Summer Olympics, when a modern and glassy image campaign was launched and established on the rest of Journal's stations, with some font and branding differences depending on market (the latter 2009 package has also taken the same direction, launched on WTMJ and spread to the rest of the chain). The 'sailboat 4' logo was retired, and the music for the station became more elaborate and grand, though the former theme was retained. Currently, the station brands its news as Live at [Time of Day], with the morning newscast going by the title Live at Daybreak.

Station cameo appearances
WTMJ's logo is shown on the top of the scoreboard in the 1989 film Major League, which was filmed at Milwaukee County Stadium; the stadium was used as a stand-in for Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, where the Cleveland Indians played at the time the film was produced. The Indians are also interviewed by a WTMJ reporter, which for the purpose of continuity in the film, was a Cleveland TV station.
WTMJ is also announced in the final scene of the final episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 as Mike Nelson and the robots are sitting in a Milwaukee-area apartment on a Saturday afternoon, when The Crawling Eye comes on TV, the first movie seen on the nationally syndicated version of MST3K.
