In cell biology, the nucleus pl. nuclei; from Latin lang la nucleus or lang la nuculeus, little nut or kernel is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in most eukaryote eukaryotic cell biology cells. It contains most of the cell's genetics genetic material, organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins, such as histones, to form chromosomes. The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's genome nuclear genome. The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression.
The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and separates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nuclear lamina, a meshwork within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton supports the cell as a whole. Because the nuclear membrane is impermeable to most molecules, nuclear pores are required to allow movement of molecules across the envelope. These pores cross both of the membranes, providing a channel that allows free movement of small molecules and ions. The movement of larger molecules such as proteins is carefully controlled, and requires active transport regulated by carrier proteins. Nuclear transport is crucial to cell function, as movement through the pores is required for both gene expression and chromosomal maintenance.
Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of subnuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.
 History 
Image:Flemming1882Tafel1Fig14.jpg thumb A drawing of a cell nucleus published by Walther Flemming in 1882.
The nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered, and was first described by Franz Bauer in 1802.cite book   last =Harris   first =H   title =The Birth of the Cell   edition =   year =1999   publisher =Yale University Press   location =New Haven  
It was later described in more detail by Scottish botanist Robert Brown botanist Robert Brown in 1831 in a talk at the Linnean Society of London. Brown was studying orchids microscopically when he observed an opaque area, which he called the areola or nucleus, in the cells of the flower's outer layer.cite journal   last =  Brown   first = Robert   title = On the Organs and Mode of Fecundation of Orchidex and Asclepiadea   journal = Miscellaneous Botanical Works   volume = I   pages = 511514   date = 1866
He did not suggest a potential function. In 1838 Matthias Schleiden proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name Cytoblast cell builder. He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around cytoblasts. Franz Meyen was a strong opponent of this view having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the cytoblast or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert Remak 1852 and Rudolf Virchow 1855 who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells Omnis cellula e cellula. The function of the nucleus remained unclear.cite book   last =Cremer  first =Thomas   title =Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie   edition =   year =1985   publisher =Springer Verlag   location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo   id = ISBN 3-540-13987-7 Online Version http://www.t-cremer.de/main_de/cremer/personen/info_T_Cremer.htm#book here
Between 1876 and 1878 Oscar Hertwig published several studies on the fertilization of sea urchin eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the oocyte and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a single nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst Haeckel's theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a Monerula, a structureless mass of primordial mucus Urschleim. Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, e.g. amphibians and molluscs. Eduard Strasburger produced the same results for plants 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873 August Weismann postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the Mendelian inheritance Mendelian rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the chromosome theory of heredity was developed.
Structure
The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animals.cite book    last = Lodish     first = H    coauthors = Berk A, Matsudaira P, Kaiser CA, Krieger M, Scott MP, Zipursky SL, Darnell J.     title = Molecular Cell Biology    publisher = WH Freeman    edition = 5th    year = 2004    location = New York 
In mammalian cells, the average diameter typically varies from 11 to 22 micrometers m and occupies about 10% of the total volume.cite book   year = 2002   title = Molecular Biology of the Cell   editor = Bruce Alberts, Alexander Johnson, Julian Lewis, Martin Raff, Keith Roberts, Peter Walter   publisher = Garland Science   edition = 4th The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm, and is similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus.

Visible in this diagram are the ribosome-studded cell membrane double membranes of the nuclear envelope, the DNA complexed as chromatin, and the nucleolus. Within the cell nucleus is a viscous liquid called nucleoplasm, similar to the cytoplasm found outside the nucleus. 
  Image:NuclearPore crop.svg thumb right 250px A cross section of a nuclear pore on the surface of the nuclear envelope 1. Other diagram labels show 2 the outer ring, 3 spokes, 4 basket, and 5 filaments.
The nuclear envelope consists of two cell membrane cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 nanometers nm. The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.cite  journal    author = Paine P, Moore L, Horowitz S   title = Nuclear envelope permeability   journal = Nature   volume = 254   issue = 5496   pages = 109114   year = 1975   pmid = 1117994   doi = 10.1038/254109a0   The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum RER, and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER Lumen anatomy lumen.
Nuclear pores, which provide aqueous channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as nucleoporins. The pores are about 125 million atomic mass unit daltons in molecular weight and consist of around 50 in yeast to 100 proteins in vertebrates. The pores are 100 nm in total diameter; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size allows the free passage of small water-soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins, from inappropriately entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope,cite book   year = 1996  title = Human Physiology   editor = Rodney Rhoades, Richard Pflanzer   publisher = Saunders College Publishing   chapter = Ch3   edition = 3rd each of which contains a donut-shaped, eightfold-symmetric ring-shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse.cite  journal    author = Shulga N, Mosammaparast N, Wozniak R, Goldfarb D   title = Yeast nucleoporins involved in passive nuclear envelope permeability   journal = J Cell Biol   volume = 149   issue = 5   pages = 10271038   year = 2000   pmid = 10831607   doi = 10.1083/jcb.149.5.1027   Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of filamentous extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins.
Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some RNAs are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, while those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins.cite  journal    author = Pemberton L, Paschal B   title = Mechanisms of receptor-mediated nuclear import and nuclear export   journal = Traffic   volume = 6   issue = 3   pages = 187198   year = 2005   pmid = 15702987   doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00270.x   Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, as well as other small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular cell signaling signaling can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their Ligand biochemistry ligand; in the absence of ligand many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.
Cytoskeleton
main Nuclear lamina 
In animal cells, two networks of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: the nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork on the internal face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope. Both systems provide structural support for the nuclear envelope and anchoring sites for chromosomes and nuclear pores.
The nuclear lamina is mostly composed of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later transported into the nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina.cite  journal    author = Stuurman N, Heins S, Aebi U   title = Nuclear lamins: their structure, assembly, and interactions   journal = J Struct Biol   volume = 122   issue = 12   pages = 4266   year = 1998   pmid = 9724605   doi = 10.1006/jsbi.1998.3987  cite  journal    author = Goldman A, Moir R, Montag-Lowy M, Stewart M, Goldman R   title = Pathway of incorporation of microinjected lamin A into the nuclear envelope   journal = J Cell Biol   volume = 119   issue = 4   pages = 725735   year = 1992   pmid = 1429833   doi = 10.1083/jcb.119.4.725   Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil,cite journal   author = Goldman R, Gruenbaum Y, Moir R, Shumaker D, Spann T   title = Nuclear lamins: building blocks of nuclear architecture    doi = 10.1101/gad.960502   url=http://www.genesdev.org/cgi/content/full/16/5/533   journal = Genes Dev   volume = 16   issue = 5   pages = 533547   year = 2002   pmid = 11877373 that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase.cite  journal   author = Moir RD, Yoona M, Khuona S, Goldman RD.   title = Nuclear Lamins A and B1: Different Pathways of Assembly during Nuclear Envelope Formation in Living Cells   journal = Journal of Cell Biology   date = 2000   volume = 151   issue = 6   pages =  11551168   pmid = 11121432   doi = 10.1083/jcb.151.6.1155   The lamin structures that make up the veil bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.cite  journal    authors = Spann TP, Goldman AE, Wang C, Huang S, Goldman RD.   journal = Journal of Cell Biology   title = Alteration of nuclear lamin organization inhibits RNA polymerase IIdependent transcription   date = 2002   volume = 156   issue = 4   pages = 603608   pmid = 11854306   doi = 10.1083/jcb.200112047   
Like the components of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helix alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an Antiparallel biochemistry antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in the length of the filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.
Mutations in lamin genes leading to defects in filament assembly are known as laminopathies. The most notable laminopathy is the family of diseases known as progeria, which causes the appearance of premature aging in its sufferers. The exact mechanism by which the associated biochemical changes give rise to the aged phenotype is not well understood.cite  journal  author=Mounkes LC, Stewart CL  title = Aging and nuclear organization: lamins and progeria   journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology   date = 2004   volume = 16   pages = 322327   pmid = 15145358   doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2004.03.009

main Chromosome

The cell nucleus contains the majority of the cell's genetic material, in the form of multiple linear DNA molecules organized into structures called chromosomes. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype. A small fraction of the cell's genes are located instead in the mitochondria.
There are two types of chromatin. Euchromatin is the less compact DNA form, and contains genes that are frequently gene expression expressed by the cell.cite  journal    author = Ehrenhofer-Murray A   title = Chromatin dynamics at DNA replication, transcription and repair   journal = Eur J Biochem   volume = 271   issue = 12   pages = 23352349   year = 2004   pmid = 15182349   doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04162.x   The other type, heterochromatin, is the more compact form, and contains DNA that are infrequently transcribed. This structure is further categorized into facultative heterochromatin, consisting of genes that are organized as heterochromatin only in certain cell types or at certain stages of development, and constitutive heterochromatin that consists of chromosome structural components such as telomeres and centromeres.cite  journal    author = Grigoryev S, Bulynko Y, Popova E   title = The end adjusts the means: heterochromatin remodelling during terminal cell differentiation   journal = Chromosome Res   volume = 14   issue = 1   pages = 5369   year = 2006   pmid = 16506096   doi = 10.1007/s10577-005-1021-6   During interphase the chromatin organizes itself into discrete individual patches,cite journal   last = Schardin   first = Margit   authorlink =   coauthors = T.

Antibodies to certain types of chromatin organization, particularly nucleosomes, have been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus.cite journal   author = NF Rothfield, BD Stollar   title = The Relation of Immunoglobulin Class, Pattern of Antinuclear Antibody, and Complement-Fixing Antibodies to DNA in Sera from Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus   journal = J Clin Invest   year = 1967   volume = 46   issue = 11   pages = 17851794   pmid = 4168731   doi = 10.1172/JCI105669   doi_brokendate = 2008-06-24 These are known as anti-nuclear antibody anti-nuclear antibodies ANA and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction.cite journal   author = S Barned, AD Goodman, DH Mattson   title = Frequency of anti-nuclear antibodies in multiple sclerosis   journal = Neurology   date = 1995   volume = 45   issue = 2   pages =  384385   pmid = 7854544 As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of autoimmune diseases is not obvious.
Nucleolus
main Nucleolus
Image:Micrograph of a cell nucleus.png thumb left 200px An electron micrograph of a cell nucleus, showing the darkly stained nucleolus.
The nucleolus is a discrete densely-stained structure found in the nucleus. It is not surrounded by a membrane, and is sometimes called a suborganelle. It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA, DNA coding for ribosomal RNA rRNA. These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions NOR. The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association. This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures.cite journal

    volume = 125  
The first step in ribosomal assembly is transcription of the rDNA, by a protein called RNA polymerase I, forming a large pre-rRNA precursor. This is cleaved into the subunits 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA.cite  journal

    accessdate =     doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2003.10.012   The transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and assembly of rRNA occurs in the nucleolus, aided by small nucleolar RNA snoRNA molecules, some of which are derived from spliced introns from messenger RNAs encoding genes related to ribosomal function. The assembled ribosomal subunits are the largest structures passed through the nuclear pores.
When observed under the electron microscope, the nucleolus can be seen to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers FCs, surrounded by the dense fibrillar component DFC, which in turn is bordered by the granular component GC. Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and therefore when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occurs in the GC.

Besides the nucleolus, the nucleus contains a number of other non-membrane delineated bodies. These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association PIKA, promyelocytic leukaemia PML bodies, paraspeckles and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant in that they show that the nucleoplasm is not uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.
Other subnuclear structures appear as part of abnormal disease processes. For example, the presence of small intranuclear rods have been reported in some cases of nemaline myopathy. This condition typically results from mutations in actin, and the rods themselves consist of mutant actin as well as other cytoskeletal proteins.cite  journal    last =Goebel  first =H.H.   coauthors =I Warlow  month=January   year =1997   title =Nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rodsintranuclear rod myopathy  journal =Neuromuscular Disorders   volume =7   issue =1   pages =1319   doi = 10.1016/S0960-89669600404-X  pmid =9132135   url =  
=Cajal bodies and gems=
A nucleus typically contains between 1 and 10 compact structures called Cajal body Cajal bodies or coiled bodies CB, whose diameter measures between 0.2 m and 2.0 m depending on the cell type and species. When seen under an electron microscope, they resemble balls of tangled thread and are dense foci of distribution for the protein coilin.cite  journal    author = Matera AG, Frey MA.   title = Coiled Bodies and Gems: Janus or Gemini?   journal = American Journal of Human Genetics   volume = 63   issue = 2   pages = 317321   date = 1998   pmid = 9683623    doi = 10.1086/301992   CBs are involved in a number of different roles relating to RNA processing, specifically snoRNA small nucleolar RNA snoRNA and small nuclear RNA snRNA maturation, and histone mRNA modification.
Similar to Cajal bodies are Gemini of coiled bodies, or gems, whose name is derived from the Gemini constellation Gemini constellation in reference to their close twin relationship with CBs. Gems are similar in size and shape to CBs, and in fact are virtually indistinguishable under the microscope. Unlike CBs, gems do not contain snRNP small nuclear ribonucleoproteins snRNPs, but do contain a protein called survivor of motor neurons SMN whose function relates to snRNP biogenesis. Gems are believed to assist CBs in snRNP biogenesis,cite  journal

=PIKA and PTF domains=
PIKA domains, or polymorphic interphase karyosomal associations, were first described in microscopy studies in 1991. Their function was and remains unclear, though they were not thought to be associated with active DNA replication, transcription, or RNA processing.cite  journal    author = Saunders WS, Cooke CA, Earnshaw WC   title = Compartmentalization within the nucleus: discovery of a novel subnuclear region.   journal = Journal of Cellular Biology   volume = 115   issue = 4   pages = 919931   date = 1991    doi = 10.1083/jcb.115.4.919   PMID 1955462 They have been found to often associate with discrete domains defined by dense localization of the transcription factor PTF, which promotes transcription of snRNA.cite  journal    author = Pombo A, Cuello P, Schul W, Yoon J, Roeder R, Cook P, Murphy S   title = Regional and temporal specialization in the nucleus: a transcriptionally active nuclear domain rich in PTF, Oct1 and PIKA antigens associates with specific chromosomes early in the cell cycle   journal = EMBO J   volume = 17   issue = 6   pages = 17681778   year = 1998   pmid = 9501098   doi = 10.1093/emboj/17.6.1768

Promyelocytic leukaemia bodies PML bodies are spherical bodies found scattered throughout the nucleoplasm, measuring around 0.21.0 m. They are known by a number of other names, including nuclear domain 10 ND10, Kremer bodies, and PML oncogenic domains. They are often seen in the nucleus in association with Cajal bodies and cleavage bodies. It has been suggested that they play a role in regulating transcription.

    accessdate = 2007-03-06  paraspeckles are now known to also exist in all human primary cells, transformed cell lines and tissue sections.cite  journal    quotes=no  author= Fox, A. et al  year= 2005  url= http://www.molbiolcell.org/cgi/reprint/16/11/5304  title= P54nrb Forms a Heterodimer with PSP1 That Localizes to Paraspeckles in an RNA-dependent Manner    doi = 10.1091/mbc.E05-06-0587  journal= Molecular Biology of the Cell  volume=16  pages=53045315    pmid = 16148043   PMID 16148043 Their name is derived from their distribution in the nucleus; the para is short for parallel and the speckles refers to the splicing speckles to which they are always in close proximity.
Paraspeckles are dynamic structures that are altered in response to changes in cellular metabolic activity. They are transcription dependent and in the absence of RNA Pol II transcription, the paraspeckle disappears and all of its associated protein components  PSP1, p54nrb, PSP2, CFIm68 and PSF form a crescent shaped perinucleolar cap in the nucleolus. This phenomenon is demonstrated during the cell cycle. In the cell cycle, paraspeckles are present during interphase and during all of mitosis except for telophase. During telophase, when the two daughter nuclei are formed, there is no RNA Pol II Transcription genetics transcription so the protein components instead form a perinucleolar cap.
=Splicing speckles=
Sometimes referred to as interchromatin granule clusters, speckles are rich in splicing snRNPs and other splicing proteins necessary for pre-mRNA processing. Because of a cell's changing requirements, the composition and location of these bodies changes according to mRNA transcription and regulation via phosphorylation of specific proteins.cite  journal    last =Handwerger   first =Korie E.   coauthors =Joseph G. Gall   month=January   year =2006   title =Subnuclear organelles: new insights into form and function   journal =TRENDS in Cell Biology   volume =16   issue =1   pages =1926   doi =10.1016/j.tcb.2005.11.005    pmid = 16325406  
Function
The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the cell cycle. The nucleus provides a site for genetic transcription genetics transcription that is segregated from the location of translation genetics translation in the cytoplasm, allowing levels of gene regulation that are not available to prokaryotes.
Cell compartmentalization
The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In some cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. Hexokinase is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose-6-phosphate from glucose. At high concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate, a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,cite book   last =Lehninger   first =Albert L.   coauthors =David L. Nelson, Michael M. Cox.   title =Lehninger principles of biochemistry   edition =3rd   year =2000   publisher =Worth Publishers   location =New York   id = ISBN 1-57259-931-6  where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.cite  journal   author=Moreno F, Ahuatzi D, Riera A, Palomino CA, Herrero P.  date=2005  title = Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway.  journal=Biochem Soc Trans   volume =  33   issue = 1  pages = 265268   pmid = 15667322    doi = 10.1042/BST0330265   PMID 15667322 
In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example in the case of NF-B-controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammation inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a cell signaling signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule TNF-, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-B. A nuclear localisation signal on the NF-B protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.
The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA.cite  journal    last = Grlich   first = Dirk   coauthors = Ulrike Kutay   title = Transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm   journal = Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol.   volume =   issue = 15   pages = 607660   date = 1999   pmid = 10611974    doi = 10.1042/BST0330265   Eukaryotic mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins. The splicing is done inside the nucleus before the mRNA can be accessed by ribosomes for translation. Without the nucleus ribosomes would translate newly transcribed unprocessed mRNA resulting in misformed and nonfunctional proteins.
Gene expression
main Gene expression

Begin indicates the 3' end of the DNA, where new RNA synthesis begins; end indicates the 5' end, where the primary transcripts are almost complete.
Gene expression first involves transcription genetics transcription, in which DNA is used as a template to produce RNA. In the case of genes encoding proteins, that RNA produced from this process is messenger RNA mRNA, which then needs to be translation genetics translated by ribosomes to form a protein. As ribosomes are located outside the nucleus, mRNA produced needs to be exported.cite book  title=Protein Synthesis and Ribosome Structure: Translating the Genome  last=Nierhaus  first=Knud H.  coauthors=Daniel N. Wilson  year=2004  publisher=Wiley-VCH  isbn=3527306382 
Since the nucleus is the site of transcription, it also contains a variety of proteins which either directly mediate transcription or are involved in regulating the process. These proteins include helicases that unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, RNA polymerases that synthesize the growing RNA molecule, topoisomerases that change the amount of supercoiling in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of transcription factors that regulate expression.cite book  title=Genome Structure and Function: From Chromosomes Characterization to Genes Technology  last=Nicolini  first=Claudio A.  year=1997  publisher=Springer  isbn=0792345657 
Processing of pre-mRNA
main Post-transcriptional modification
Newly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as primary transcripts or pre-mRNA. They must undergo post-transcriptional modification in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the nucleus without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein translation genetics translation. The three main modifications are 5' capping, 3' polyadenylation, and RNA splicing. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles hnRNPs. Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-adenine tail is only added after transcription is complete. 
RNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the spliceosome, is the process by which introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibody antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different primary structure protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.

Dynamics and regulation
Nuclear transport
main Nuclear transport
Image:RanGTPcycle.png 360px Right thumb Macromolecules, such as RNA and proteins, are active transport actively transported across the nuclear membrane in a process called the Ran biology Ran-Guanosine triphosphate GTP nuclear transport cycle.
The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation,cite book   last = Watson   first = JD   coauthors = Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann A, Levine M, Losick R.   title = Molecular Biology of the Gene   publisher = Peason Benjamin Cummings; CSHL Press.   date = 2004   edition = 5th ed.   chapter = Ch910  macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. Cargo proteins that must be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by GTPases, enzymes that hydrolyze the molecule guanosine triphosphate to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is Ran biology Ran, which can bind either GTP or GDP guanosine diphosphate depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.
Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.
Specialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to the these molecules' central role in protein translation; mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.
Assembly and disassembly
Image:Mitosis-flourescent.jpg thumb left 230px An image of a newt lung cell staining biology stained with fluorescent dyes during metaphase. The mitotic spindle can be seen, stained green, attached to the two sets of chromosomes, stained light blue. All chromosomes but one are already at the metaphase plate. 
During its lifetime a nucleus may be broken down, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death. During these events, the structural components of the nucleusthe envelope and laminaare systematically degraded.
During the cell cycle the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. However, in many cells the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus, the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.cite  journal
     last = Lippincott-Schwartz    first = Jennifer   title = Cell biology: Ripping up the nuclear envelope   journal = Nature   volume = 416   issue = 6876   pages = 3132   date = 2002-03-07   doi =10.1038/416031a    pmid = 11882878   Therefore the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins.cite journal   author = Boulikas T   title = Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle   journal = Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr   volume = 5   issue = 1   pages = 177   year = 1995   pmid = 7549180 Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.
Apoptosis is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and thus degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.cite  journal    author = Steen R, Collas P   title = Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression   journal = J Cell Biol   volume = 153   issue = 3   pages = 621626   year = 2001   pmid = 11331311   doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621  
The nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus replicate and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.
Anucleated and polynucleated cells
Image:redbloodcells.jpg thumb 230px right Human red blood cells, like those of other mammals, lack nuclei. This occurs as a normal part of the cells' development.
Although most cells have a single nucleus, some cell types have no nucleus, and others have many nuclei. This can be a normal process, as in the maturation of mammalian red blood cells, or an anomalous result of faulty cell division.
Anucleated cells contain no nucleus and are therefore incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria and serves primarily as a transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature via erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled during the process of differentiation from an erythroblast to a reticulocyte, the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte.cite  journal    last =Skutelsky   first =E.   coauthors =Danon D.   date =June 1970   year =   title =Comparative study of nuclear expulsion from the late erythroblast and cytokinesis   journal =J Cell Biol   issue =603   pages =625635   pmid =5422968   doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621   The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature micronucleated erythrocytes into the bloodstream.cite  journal    last =Torous   first =DK   coauthors =Dertinger SD, Hall NE, Tometsko CR.   date =   year =2000   title =Enumeration of micronucleated reticulocytes in rat peripheral blood: a flow cytometric study   journal =Mutat Res   volume =   issue =46512   pages =9199   doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621  pmid =10708974   url =  cite  journal    last =Hutter    first =KJ   coauthors =Stohr M.   year =1982   title =Rapid detection of mutagen induced micronucleated erythrocytes by flow cytometry   journal =Histochemistry   issue =753   pages =353362   pmid =7141888   url =    doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621   Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other is binucleate.

Evolution  
As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus' evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major theories have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support.cite journal   author = Pennisi E.  title = Evolutionary biology. The birth of the nucleus   doi = 10.1126/science.305.5685.766   journal = Science   volume = 305   issue =5685   pages = 766768   year =2004   pmid = 15297641
The theory known as the syntrophic model proposes that a Symbiosis symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus-containing eukaryotic cell. It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern Methanogenesis methanogenic archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern myxobacteria, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, which are thought to have developed from a similar endosymbiotic relationship between proto-eukaryotes and aerobic bacteria.cite book   author= Margulis, Lynn   date= 1981   title= Symbiosis in Cell Evolution   pages=206227   publisher= W. H. Freeman and Company   location=San Francisco   id = ISBN 0-7167-1256-3 The archaeal origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and eukarya have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that myxobacteria are motile, can form multicellular complexes, and possess kinases and G proteins similar to eukarya, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell.cite journal   author = Lopez-Garcia P, Moreira D.   title = Selective forces for the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus   doi = 10.1002/bies.20413   journal = Bioessays   volume = 28   issue =5   pages = 525533   year =2006   pmid = 16615090
A second model proposes that proto-eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an endosymbiotic stage. This model is based on the existence of modern planctomycetes bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other compartmentalized membrane structures.cite  journal    author =Fuerst JA.   title = Intracellular compartmentation in planctomycetes   journal = Annu Rev Microbiol.   volume = 59   issue =   pages = 299328   year =2005   pmid = 15910279   doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121258    A similar proposal states that a eukaryote-like cell, the chronocyte, evolved first and phagocytosed archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell.cite journal   author =Hartman H, Fedorov A.   title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell: a genomic investigation    doi = 10.1073/pnas.032658599   journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.   volume = 99   issue =3   pages = 14201425   year =2002   pmid = 11805300 
The most controversial model, known as viral eukaryogenesis, posits that the membrane-bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a prokaryote by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins analogizing histones to viral envelopes. One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with phagocytosis to form an early cellular predator.Bell PJ. 2001. Viral eukaryogenesis: was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? J Mol Biol Sep;533:251256. PMID 11523012 Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by poxviruses, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA polymerases in modern poxviruses and eukaryotes.Takemura M. 2001. Poxviruses and the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus. J Mol Evol 525:419425. PMID 11443345 cite journal   author = Villarreal L, DeFilippis V   title = A hypothesis for DNA viruses as the origin of eukaryotic replication proteins    doi = 10.1128/JVI.74.15.7079-7084.2000   journal = J Virol   volume = 74   issue = 15   pages = 70797084   year = 2000   pmid = 10888648 It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral eukaryogenesis hypothesis.Bell PJ. 2006. Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus. J Theor Biol 2006 November 7;2431:5463. PMID 16846615  
Finally, a very recent proposal suggests that traditional variants of the endosymbiont theory are insufficiently powerful to explain the origin of the eukaryotic nucleus. This model, termed the exomembrane hypothesis, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosome ribosomal subunits.cite  journal    author = de Roos AD  title = The origin of the eukaryotic cell based on conservation of existing interfaces  journal = Artif Life   volume = 12   issue = 4   pages = 513523.   year =2006   pmid = 16953783   doi = 10.1162/artl.2006.12.4.513
