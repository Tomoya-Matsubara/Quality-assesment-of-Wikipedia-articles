British Airways plc () is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom. It has always been centred on its main hub at London Heathrow Airport and is the largest airline in the UK based on fleet size, international flights and international destinations; British Airways was considered the largest airline of the UK, by passenger numbers, from its creation in 1974 until 2008, where rival EasyJet displaced it.1 Its second major hub is London Gatwick Airport.
The British Airways Group was formed on 1 September 1974 through nationalisation by the Labour Government of the time. Almost thirteen years later, in February 1987, the company was privatised. The carrier quickly entered a period of rapid and unprecedented growth, leading to the use of the slogan &quot;The World's Favourite Airline&quot;, and dominated its domestic rivals during the 1990s.
The formation of Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984 began a tense relationship with BA, which led to &quot;one of the most bitter and protracted libel actions in aviation history&quot;.2 In 2008 the management of BA began to plan a merger with Iberia Airlines; a preliminary agreement to merge was announced in November 2009.34 The combined airline will become the world's third-largest carrier (after Delta Air Lines and American Airlines) in terms of annual revenue. On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had agreed to a merger, forming the International Airlines Group, although BA would continue to operate under its current brand.5
Origins and formation
    On 31 March 1924, Britain's four pioneer airlines that started up in the immediate post war period—Handley Page Transport, British Marine Air Navigation Co Ltd, Daimler Airways and Instone Air Line Ltd—joined together to form Imperial Airways Limited, developing routes throughout the British Empire to India, some parts of Africa and later to Canberra, Australia.6 Meanwhile a number of smaller UK air transport companies had begun operating, and by 1935 many of these had merged to form the original privately owned British Airways Ltd.7 Following a government review, Imperial Airways and British Airways were nationalised in November 1939 to form the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).8910
Post-war, BOAC continued to operate the majority of long-haul services in Britain,11 other than routes to South America &lt;U+2013&gt; these were flown by British South American Airways, which was merged back into BOAC in 1949. Continental European and domestic flights were flown by a new nationalised airline, British European Airways Corporation (BEA), which compulsorily took over the scheduled services of existing UK independent airlines.12 On 2 May 1952 BOAC became the world's first airline to operate jet airliners. The inaugural flight with the de Havilland Comet 1 was from London to Johannesburg.1314 However, the Comet's service introduction was plagued by structural problems and accidents,1516 leading to its replacement with the upgraded Comet 4 models in 1958.171819
The birth of the mass package holiday business meant change for the airline industry and BEA met the challenge by establishing BEA Airtours in 1970. In 1972, the BOAC and BEA managements were combined under the newly formed British Airways Board,20 with the physical operations of the separate airlines coming together as British Airways on 1 April 1974, under the guidance of David Nicolson as Chairman of the board.2122
In 1975, British Airways was headquartered in the Victoria Terminal in London. Its international division was headquartered at the Speedbird House by Heathrow Airport, while its European division was headquartered at Bealine House, Ruislip, Middlesex. The regional division was headquartered in Ruford House, Hounslow.23
1970s &lt;U+2013&gt; Consolidation and Concorde
   The new company had inherited a mix of aircraft from its predecessors, it quickly retired the Standard VC10s it had inherited from BOAC and the last Vickers Vanguards that came from BEA.24 It also ordered the Hawker Siddeley 748 for use on Scottish routes to enable the Vickers Viscount to be retired.25 In October 1974 the first Lockheed Tristar was delivered, and introduced in January 1975;26 more Tristars were ordered in following years.2728 A novel introduction in on 12 January 1975 was the British Airways Shuttle service from Heathrow to Glasgow which allowed a walk-on no reservation service.29 From its formation in 1974, British Airways aeroplanes carried a Union Flag scheme painted on their tail fins.3031
The then Secretary of State for Trade, Peter Shore, conducted a review of the Government's aviation policy, in 1976 he announced a new &quot;spheres of influence&quot; policy that ended dual designation for British airlines on all long-haul routes. As a result, British Airwars and British Caledonian, the second biggest airliner in Britain, were no longer permitted to run competing scheduled services on the long-haul routes. British Caledonian had to withdraw from the East African routes as well as from the London-New York and London-Los Angeles routes in favour of BA.32333435 In return, British Caledonian became the sole British flag carrier to the entire South American mainland, taking over routes former served by British Airways to Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.3637383940
On 21 January 1976 British Airways operated the first Concorde service, it was one of only two airlines to operate the supersonic Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde aircraft.41 British Airways, simultaneously with Air France,42 inaugurated the world's first supersonic passenger service with the iconic and controversial Concorde in January 1976,434445 a daily service between Heathrow and New York JFK becoming one of the service's hallmarks.4647 Initially, Concorde was a financial burden,48 required of the national carrier by the government, and it attracted criticism from the press as a white elephant.4950
However Sir John King recognised the charismatic and prestige importance of Concorde to British Airways,51 purchased them outright from the government, and turning a profit within a year.5253 According to British Airways' management the aircraft broke even in flights holding around 40&lt;U+2013&gt;45% of passenger capacity, in 1985 the average passenger capacity in use per flight was at 65%.54 BA used Concorde to win business customers,5556 guaranteeing a certain number of Concorde upgrades in return for corporate accounts with the airline &lt;U+2013&gt; a key factor in winning business from transatlantic competitors. Although the carrier did not disclose specific numbers, media reports estimated that the Heathrow to New York service made an annual  operating profit by the early-2000s.57
1980s &lt;U+2013&gt; Privatisation and dirty tricks
 Sir John King, later Lord King, was appointed Chairman in 1981 with the mission of preparing the airline for privatisation.5859 King hired Colin Marshall as CEO in 1983. King was credited with transforming the loss-making giant into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world, boldly claiming to be &quot;The World's Favourite Airline&quot;, while many other large airlines struggled.60
The airline's fleet and route map were overhauled in the early years of King's tenure,61 with brand and advertising experts being recruited to change the airline's image.62 Over 23,000 jobs were shed in the early 1980s,63 though King managed the considerable trick of boosting staff morale and modernising operations at the same time.64 Offering generous inducements for staff to leave led to record losses of , to the cost of taxpayers but to the benefit of the future privatised company.6566
 At Marshall's direction, the airline consolidated most of its long-haul operations in 1986,67 including Concorde services,68 at the newly constructed Heathrow Terminal 4.6970 Terminal 4 would remain as BA's hub at Heathrow Airport for the next 22 years.71 Due in part to a recession and rising fuel prices,727374 and aircraft such as the Hawker Siddeley Trident, Vickers Super VC10 and Boeing 707 were quickly phased out of service75 planes such as the Boeing 737 were acquired in their place.767778 In an effort to increase the use of the Concorde fleet, Lord King allowed the planes to be chartered for special services.798081
The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987 by the Conservative government,828384 the initial share offering being nine times oversubscribed.85 Four months later, in July 1987, British Airways announced the controversial takeover of Britain's &quot;second&quot; airline British Caledonian,868788 within the industry it was widely acknowledged as a mutually agreed rescue deal to avoid the latter's collapse.89 The Caledonian name was kept alive for a token period by rebranding its charter subsidiary British Airtours as Caledonian Airways. In 1992 it absorbed some of the routes of Gatwick-based carrier Dan-Air, another traditional British-based airline.90

Soon after British Airways' privatisation, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways was beginning to emerge as a competitor on some of BA's most lucrative routes.91 Following Virgin's highly publicised mercy mission to Iraq to fly home hostages of Saddam Hussein in 1991,92 King is reported to have told Marshall and his PA Director David Burnside to &quot;do something about Branson&quot;.93 This began the campaign of &quot;dirty tricks&quot; that ended in Branson suing King and British Airways for libel in 1992.94 King countersued Branson and the case went to trial in 1993.95 British Airways, faced with likely defeat, settled the case, giving &lt;U+00A3&gt;500,000 to Branson and a further &lt;U+00A3&gt;110,000 to his airline; furthermore, BA was to pay the legal fees of up to .9697 Branson divided the compensation among his staff, the so-called &quot;BA bonus.&quot;98 British Airways and Virgin Atlantic continued to be noticeably bitter and active rivals for many years afterwards.99100
1990s &lt;U+2013&gt; Changes, subsidiaries and growth
Deutsche BA  at Berlin Tegel Airport
During the 1990s, BA became the world's most profitable airline under the slogan &quot;The World's Favourite Airline&quot;.101102 In 1992, BA bought the small German domestic airline Delta Air Transport and renamed it Deutsche BA.103104105 By the time it was sold in June 2003, Deutsche BA was operating 16  and had 800 staff.106107 British Airways also entered into the French market in 1994 by purchasing a 49.9% stake in the French airline TAT European Airlines,108 and 70% of Air Libert&lt;U+00E9&gt; in 1997,109 seeking to challenging the dominance of Air France.110111
1993 was a highly significant year of expansion and change for British Airways,112 most notably the company purchased a 25% stake in Australian airline Qantas,113 purchased a 24% stake in American airline USAir,114 and wholly acquired Brymon Airways to form BA Connect all in the same year.115 BA had planned to acquire as much as a 44% share in USAir, but backed down following a lack of approval from the US government;116117 developing a significantly larger presence in the North American market remained a major priority of British Airways throughout the 90s.
 thumb|right|British Airways  TriStar in Landor livery Another crucial event in 1993 occurred as BA formed British Asia Airways, a subsidiary based in the Republic of China (Taiwan), to operate between London and Taipei.118119 Owing to political sensitivities,120 British Asia Airways had not only a different name but also a different livery, the Union Jack tailfin being replaced by the Chinese characters &lt;U+82F1&gt;&lt;U+4E9E&gt; (English Asia). Perhaps the most symbolic change to British Airways in the turbulent year of 1993 came when Lord King stepped down as chairman of the company and was replaced by former deputy Colin Marshall.121122 Bob Ayling, who later took on the role of CEO, was appointed Managing Director by Marshall. Lord King was appointed as President of British Airways,123 a role created specifically for him and which he retained until his death in July 2005.124125
British Airways began planning for its future corporate headquarters at Harmondsworth Moor,126 in 1995 British Airways was then headquartered at the Speedbird House at Heathrow Airport.127 British Airways also used some of their prosperity to upgrade and replace much of their fleet. Aircraft acquisitions included the Boeing 747-400,128129 the Boeing 777,130131132 and the company's first purchase from Airbus Industrie for members of the Airbus A320 family;133134135 aimed to phase out the remaining Lockheed Tristars and McDonnell .136 Six of the disposed Tristars ended up seeing service as aerial refuelling tankers in the Royal Air Force.137
A new trend in aviation competition emerged in Britain during the 90s in the form of the budget airline; new companies such as Ryanair and EasyJet emerged,138 rising to prominence using a no-frills and low price approach to gain marketshare away from the traditional carriers.139140 Following in the wake of deregulation, these airline companies would prove to be an increasing source of competition domestically to British Airways.141142143 A small handful of short routes also began to come under effective pressure from modern high speed rail systems, such as the Eurostar service between London, Paris, and Brussels.144145
1996 &lt;U+2013&gt; Bob Ayling era
   In 1996, British Airways, with its newly appointed Chief Executive Bob Ayling, entered a period of financial turbulence due to increased competition, high oil prices,146147 and a strong pound.148 British Airways' management and trade unions clashed over planned changes, Ayling taking a hardline stance with the unions,149 the resulting disruption from the confrontations cost the company hundreds of millions of pounds.150151 With several strikes and BA's restructuring plans stalling,152153 investors became frustrated, over time the company was seen as being less active and successful than its peak in 1993, causing its share value to suffer.154155
In 1996 relations between British Airways and USAir, which BA held a stake then valued at  in, soured,156157 despite Ayling's preference to &quot;...remain a major investor in USAir&quot;,158 BA later sold its share in the company.159160 Robert Ayling had also pursued parnership and antitrust immunity with American Airlines,161162 which was inpart what caused the breakdown in the partnership with USAir; however this was unsuccessful as well due to the conditions placed on the deal by regulatory authorities, the most painful of which would have been the sacrifice of landing slots at Heathrow.163164
In 1997, Ayling dropped BA's traditional Union Flag tailfin livery in favour of world design tailfins,165166167 in an effort to change its image from a strictly British and aloof carrier to a more cosmopolitan airline. The move was not a success168169 and Ayling slowed the process, eventually declaring the fleet would sport a dual livery; half a Union Flag design, half the world design tailfins. Several people spoke out against the change from the traditional Union Jack Scheme, including the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher;170 BA's traditional rivals, Virgin Atlantic, quickly adopted the British flag along with the slogan &quot;Britain's national flagcarrier&quot;.171 On 6 June 1999, BA chief executive Bob Ayling announced that all BA planes would be repainted with the Union Flag, based on a design first used on Concorde.172173
Benefits during Ayling's leadership included cost savings of &lt;U+00A3&gt;750M174 and the establishment of the successful, but highly subsidised, Go in 1998.175 Go was a low-cost carrier intended to compete in the rapidly emerging &quot;no-frills&quot; segment.176 After four years of successful operations British Airways searched for a buyer for Go,177 eventually the airline was sold off to venture capitalists 3i and later merged with EasyJet.178 Ayling also sought a reduction of capacity,179 cancelling  orders in favour of the  and rationalising BA's short-haul fleet with an order for the Airbus A320 family.180 Waterside, the current British Airways head office, officially opened in 1998.181
2000 &lt;U+2013&gt; Rod Eddington era
   In 1999, British Airways reported a 50 percent drop in profits, its worst since privatisation at the time.182183 In March 2000, Bob Ayling was removed from his position and in May, British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. Eddington set about the termination of some investment programs, such as in Olympic Airways,184 and cutting the workforce further, later in response to the slump caused by the 9/11 attacks in 2001.185186187 From a share value of 760p in May 1997, BA's value had dropped to only 150p in September 2001, showing how heavily the company had been hit.188
With the Paris Crash in 2000,189 the September 11 attacks and escalating maintenance costs,190 the future of Concorde was limited despite the expensive modifications after the crash. It was announced on 10 April 2003 that following October that year BA would cease scheduled services with Concorde, due to depressed passenger numbers.191192193194 The last commercial Concorde flight from New York to London was on 24 October 2003.195196 The airline still owns eight Concordes which are on long term loan to museums in the UK, U.S. and Barbados.197198
During Eddington's leadership, there were several other fleet changes. A well received decision of Eddington's was to end the use of ethnic liveries on aircraft, announcing in May 2001 that all of BA's fleet will be repainted in an variant of the Union flag livery used on Concorde.199 Boeing 747-200 and several Boeing 767 aircraft were retired in an effort to cut costs,200201 interest was expressed in the upcoming Boeing 7E7 and the canceled Boeing Sonic Cruiser.202203
Since 2002, BA has strongly marketed the full-service nature of its remaining domestic flights204 by the use of principal airports, and provision of complimentary food and drink.205 This comes as a response to the low cost operators' aggressive pricing,206 even though its main full-service UK rival bmi has now abandoned some &quot;frills&quot; on its domestic network. Willie Walsh later pledged to retain the full-service model on its much reduced UK network as a means of distinguishing BA from the competition, and that customers were willing to pay extra for higher service levels.207208
In June 2003, the German subsidiary, Deutsche BA, was sold to investment group Intro Verwaltungsgesellschaft.209 On 8 September 2004, British Airways announced that it was to sell its 18.5 percent stake in Qantas, but would continue the alliance (such as sharing revenue), particularly on the Kangaroo Routes.210 The  raised was used to reduce the airline's debt.211 Lord Marshall, who had been appointed a life peer in 1998, retired as Chairman in July 2004 and was replaced by Martin Broughton, former Chairman of British American Tobacco.212213 On 8 March 2005, Broughton announced that former Aer Lingus CEO Willie Walsh would take over from Rod Eddington upon his retirement in September 2005.
2005 &lt;U+2013&gt; Willie Walsh era

In September 2005, new CEO Willie Walsh, former Aer Lingus boss, announced dramatic changes to the management of British Airways, with the aim of saving  by 2008, the cost of the move to Heathrow's Terminal 5.214 He presided over the sale of BA Connect to Flybe, stating &quot;Despite the best efforts of the entire team at BA Connect, we do not see any prospect of profitability in its current form.&quot;215 BA retained a 15% stake in Flybe following the sale.216
On 1 August 2007, British Airways was fined 217 for price-fixing. The fine was imposed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) after BA admitted to the price-fixing of fuel surcharges on long haul flights. The allegation first came to light in 2006 when Virgin Atlantic reported the events to the authorities after it found staff members from BA and Virgin Atlantic were colluding. Virgin Atlantic have since been granted immunity by both the OFT and the United States Department of Justice who have been investigating the allegations. The US DOJ later announced that it would fine British Airways  () for price fixing.218
The allegations led to the resignation of commercial director Martin George and communications chief Iain Burns.219 Although BA said fuel surcharges were &quot;a legitimate way of recovering costs&quot;, in May 2007 it put aside  for legal fees and fines.220 In July 2009 Steve Ridgway, the CEO of Virgin Atlantic, admitted he knew about the illegal price fixing at his airline and did nothing to stop it.221222
In January 2008, BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies which takes advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights, and flies non-stop between major European cities and the United States.223 Operations between Paris and New York began with a single  in June 2008.224 On 2 July 2008 British Airways announced that it had agreed to buy French airline L'Avion for . The deal will result in the full integration of L'Avion with OpenSkies by early 2009.225
 On 14 March 2008 Heathrow Terminal 5, built exclusively for the use of British Airways at a cost of , was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II.226 Upon opening to passengers on 27 March 2008 serious problems immediately arose, many from staff confusion.227 The baggage handling system failed completely, resulting in seven flights departed with no baggage loaded.228 In the first five days, a backlog of 28,000 bags built up and over 300 flights were cancelled.229 Willie Walsh commented that it &quot;was not our finest hour ...the buck stops with me&quot;. Two directors left the company on 15 April 2008 as a direct result of the poor transition into BA's new terminal. Despite the announcement of record profits, Willie Walsh declined his annual bonus over the T5 fiasco.230 By October 2008 were operations running smoothly, and further long-haul services were transferred to Terminal 5.231
2009 &lt;U+2013&gt; Financial difficulties and merger
British Airways operations at Heathrow
On 30 July 2008, British Airways and Iberia Airlines announced a merger plan that would result in the two airlines joining forces in an all-stock transaction. The two airlines would retain their separate brands similar to KLM and Air France in their merger agreement.232 Later, in the beginning of August 2008, American Airlines announced an alliance with BA and Iberia, allowing the two carriers to fix fares, routes, and schedules together.233
In addition to the existing talks for a merger with Iberia and for anti-trust immunity with Iberia and American Airlines, it was announced on 2 December 2008 that British Airways has entered into talks about a possible merger with Qantas. If British Airways, Iberia and Qantas were to combine as one company it would create the largest airline in the world.234 However, on 18 December 2008, the talks with Qantas ended over issues of ownership in the aftermath of a merger.235 On 27 October 2009 Willie Walsh indicated that talks regarding the merger with Iberia were close to finalising, and that the decision &quot;would be made before the end of the year&quot;.236
In June 2009, British Airways contacted some 30,000 employees in the United Kingdom, including CEO Willie Walsh, asking them to work without pay over a period of between one week and one month to save money.237 British Airways took a significant victory at the High Court against union opposition to company restructuring plans, including a reduction in cabin crew,238 on 5 November 2009.239 On 6 November 2009 the worst ever half-year loss in British Airway's history was reported to the public.240241
On 14 December 2009 cabin crew at British Airways voted in favour of strike action over the Christmas period over job cuts and changes to staff contracts.242243244 On 17 December the ballot was ruled invalid by the High Court due to voting irregularities and the strike did not take place.245 The threat of industrial action and further strikes lingered into early 2010.246 On 6 March 2010 the Unite union announced rounds of strike action.247 More than 80 planes were grounded at Heathrow Airport alone on the first day; however, British Airways officials stated with confidence that 65% of flights would be undisturbed.248
On 8 April 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had signed an agreement to merge,249 making the combined operation the third largest commercial airline in the world by revenue.250 The newly merged company will be known as International Airlines Group, although both airlines will continue to operate under their current brands.251 The merger is believed to be worth approximately  and the new group will have over 400 aircraft and fly to over 200 destinations across the world.252 As part of the deal, British Airways shareholders will take a 55% stake in the new company, which will be head-quartered in London, with the remainder being owned by Iberia.253 The merger makes a three-way tie-in with American Airlines more likely.254
