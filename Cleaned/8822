 Ropkey Armor Museum is a military history museum in Crawfordsville, Indiana.1
The museum is privately owned by the Ropkey family. It stems from the founder Fred Ropkey's interest in military history and his past career as a Tank Platoon Leader in the US Marine Corps during the early 1950s.2
The museum collection is primarily of AFVs. These range from such rarities as a First World War M1917 to a contemporary M109 self-propelled howitzer.
 Other exhibits are soft-skin military vehicles, aircraft and a Vietnam war-era PBR. The aircraft include an Antonov An-23 and the unique Bell X-14B. This aircraft was used for early research into VTOL until it was written off in a landing accident in 1981. It is now being restored by the museum.
