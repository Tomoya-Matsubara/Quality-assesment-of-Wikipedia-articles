O Kadhal Kanmani is the soundtrack album, composed by A. R. Rahman, to the 2015 Indian Tamil film of the same name written and directed by Mani Ratnam. The soundtrack album consists of nine tracks each in original Tamil and Telugu version of the albums with one track &quot;Maula Wa Sallim&quot; being common to both. The music was release on April 4, 2015 by Sony Music India.1
Development
Usual associates of Mani Ratnam, A.R. Rahman and Vairamuthu were reported to compose for the soundtrack.2 For the dubbed Telugu version, Sirivennela Sitaramasastri3had penned the lyrics for the Telugu dubbed version. In December 2014, Rahman announced that his son A. R. Ameen will be recording a song for the soundtrack.4 In an interview with The Hindu, lyricist Vairamuthu revealed few track names and the sounds associated with them.5 He called the track &quot;Paranthu Sella Vaa&quot; anthemic whereas the track &quot;Naane Varugiren&quot; as youthful.6 Briefing on the latter track Rahman stated, &quot;Sometimes, you have to compromise words for the sound &lt;U+2014&gt; the sound is very important, it de-clutters from the words. People don&lt;U+2019&gt;t have as much bandwidth as before; we have to catch their attention immediately.&quot;7 Vairamuthu penned an antara for this track but it had very complicated words. So, instead of that, Rahman and he came up with repetitive lyrics. The word &quot;Chinnanchiru&quot; is repetitively running in the track.8 Rahman has recorded a Keerthanai, &quot;Malargal Kaettaen&quot; that incorporates Tambura sounds in its composition.9 On composing the track &quot;Mental Manadhil&quot;, Rahman stated that is a light-hearted song. He had co-written the track with Mani Ratnam because of immediate filming requirements. Rahman recalled that while writing Mental Manadhil, both he and Ratnam wanted an interesting invention of a new words or phrases for the song. During their jamming sessions - Rahman was saying 'Laka Laka' to rhyme with 'Mana Mana... Manadhil...' Ratnam said 'mental' and thus they coined 'mental' and 'manadhil' together and that thus the track was framed.10
Critical reception
The album received extremely positive reviews upon release. Srinivas Ramanujan who wrote the critical review for The Hindu called the album 'classical yet cool'. He went on to add, &quot;This album is ample proof that the Mani Ratnam-A.R.Rahman-Vairamuthu combination is still the best in the business. The musical assortment that is Oh Kadhal Kanmani is delicious to the ear!&quot;11 NIvedita Mishra for Hindustan Times showed wonder, &quot;How A.R. Rahman and Mani Ratnam make magical music&quot;.12 Criritcal review board based at Behindwoods called the album, &quot;Classy and contemporary all the way !&quot;. They gave the soundtrack album 3.75 stars (out of 5).13 Vipin of MusicAloud gave the soundtrack a score of 9 on 10. He felt that the though song promos bore resemblances to Alaipayuthey (2000) but the music is different. Hed added, &quot;Mani Ratnam still does manage to turn A. R. Rahman into his inventive best! The inventiveness here may not go down well in every case, but this will still remain a brilliant soundtrack.&quot;14 Indo-Asian News Service summarized, &quot;Some live up to the set expectations, and then there are exceptional few who always exceed the norms, to create staggering benchmarks. Veteran music composer AR Rahman might have some enviable titles and awards in his kitty, but the quality of his music continues to charm us.&quot; They called the track &quot;Naane Varugiren&quot; as 'magical' yet 'soulful'.15 Shankar of Oneindia Tamil noted that the soundtrack comes out well with music filled with 'joy of love'. He rewarded the album with 3.5 stars out of 5.16Sify based critic Siddharth writes, &quot;On the whole, 'OK Kanmani' is an album that has tracks that didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t amalgamate imaginations. Being a return to roots romance movie for Mani Ratnam, the songs were expected to be simple. But ARR has delivered some of the most complex tracks in recent times and relieves himself out of his recent debacles. It is not Rahman&lt;U+2019&gt;s best but even a half blazing ARR is miles ahead of the rest.&quot;17 Anamika Nair based at DNA India writes, &quot;The legendary duo Rahman-Ratnam who have produced few of the finest music in Kollywood and Bollywood have come together once again and created this magic number. &quot;18 Music critic Baradwaj Rangan opined, &quot;Nice-ish. That&lt;U+2019&gt;s the word I have right now for ''O Kadhal Kanmani. ''It didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t make me wince the way the soundtracks for Lingaa and Kochadaiiyaan did. It didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t activate every single one of my pleasure centres the way the soundtrack for I did. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s somewhere in the middle.&quot; However, he praised the production quality of the soundtrack album.19
