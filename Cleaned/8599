Books
The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People
The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Covey's best-known book, has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide since its first publication in 1989. (The audio version became the first non-fiction audio-book in U.S. publishing history to sell more than one million copies.) Covey argues against what he calls &quot;The Personality Ethic&quot;, something he sees as prevalent in many modern self-help books. He instead promotes what he labels &quot;The Character Ethic&quot;: aligning one&lt;U+2019&gt;s values with so-called &quot;universal and timeless&quot; principles. Covey adamantly refuses to conflate principles and values; he sees principles as external natural laws, while values remain internal and subjective. Covey proclaims that values govern people's behavior, but principles ultimately determine the consequences. Covey presents his teachings in a series of habits, manifesting as a progression from dependence via independence to interdependence.
The 8th Habit
In 2004, Covey's book The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness was published by Free Press (an imprint of Simon and Schuster). It functions as the sequel to The Seven Habits. Covey claims that effectiveness does not suffice in what he calls &quot;The Knowledge Worker Age&quot;. He proclaims that &quot;[t]he challenges and complexity we face today are of a different order of magnitude.&quot; The 8th habit essentially urges: &quot;Find your voice and inspire others to find theirs...&quot;
The Leader in Me
In November 2008, Covey released a new book The Leader in Me&lt;U+2014&gt;How Schools and Parents Around the World Are Inspiring Greatness, One Child at a Time. This book tells the story of how extraordinary schools, parents and business leaders are preparing the next generation to meet the great challenges and opportunities of the 21st Century. The Leader in Me shows how one elementary school in Raleigh, North Carolina, decided to try incorporating The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and other basic leadership skills into their school&lt;U+2019&gt;s curriculum in unique and creative ways. Inspired by the amazing success of Principal Muriel Summers and the teachers and staff of A.B. Combs Elementary School in Raleigh, other schools and parents around the world have adopted the approach and have seen remarkable results.2

Stephen Covey Online Community
In March 2008 Covey launched the Stephen Covey's Online Community. The site is a mash up of online courses, goal management and social networking. Covey uses it as a place to teach his most recent thoughts and ideas on current topics and self leadership, his books as well as goal setting and reaching. The content is shared via videos, podcasts, printable text and online activities. Users are also able to set personal goals, track their progress and share their progress with others within the community.
Utah State University
In February 2010, Covey announced his hire as a professor and first incumbent of the Jon M. Huntsman Presidential Chair in Leadership at the Huntsman School of Business at Utah State University. Huntsman and Covey were longtime friends. At USU, he taught courses, performed research, and helped to establish the Stephen R. Covey Center for Leadership, in order to better train students in innovation and ethics.3
Education initiatives
Covey has developed his 2008 book The Leader in Me into several education-related projects. On April 20, 2010 he made his first post to an education blog entitled Our Children and the Crisis in Education which appears on the Huffington Post news and blog-aggregation website. FranklinCovey has also established a website dedicated exclusively to the Leader In Me concept,4 and it holds periodic conferences and workshops to train elementary school administrators who want to integrate the Leader In Me process into their school's academic culture.5
