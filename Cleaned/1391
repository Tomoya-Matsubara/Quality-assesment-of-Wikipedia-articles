A Court of Inquiry was held into the loss of Princess Irene. Evidence was given that priming of the mines was being carried out hurriedly and by untrained personnel. A faulty primer was blamed for the explosion. Following the loss of HMS Natal 1905 6 on 30 December 1915 and HMS Vanguard 1909 6 on 9 July 1917, both caused by internal explosions, suspicion was raised at the inquiry into the loss of Natal that sabotage was to blame for the loss of all four ships. A worker at Chatham Dockyard was named as a suspect. A thorough investigation by Special Branch#United Kingdom Special Branch cleared him of any blame.sfn Ingleton 2010 p=51
