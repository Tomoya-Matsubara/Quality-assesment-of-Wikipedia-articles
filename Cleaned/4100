Mongol () is a 2007 semi-historical war film directed by Sergei Bodrov. The storyline was conceived from a screenplay written by Bodrov and Arif Aliev. Producers for the film comprised Bodrov, Sergei Selyanov and Anton Melnik. The film is based on the early life of Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin, who later came to be known as Genghis Khan. Actors Tadanobu Asano, Sun Honglei and Khulan Chuluun star in principal roles. It is the first motion picture in a trilogy based on his rule over the Mongol Empire.1 The first premiere of the film took place on July 31, 2007.2 Mongol explores abduction, kinship and the repercussions of war.3
The film was an intergovernmental co-production between companies in Germany, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia. Filming took place, for the most part, in the People's Republic of China, principally Inner Mongolia (the Mongol autonomous region), and in Kazakhstan. Shooting began in September 2005, and was completed in November 2006. It was commercially distributed by Picturehouse Entertainment theatrically, and by Universal Studios Home Entertainment for home media. Following its release in theaters, the film was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film as a submission from Kazakhstan.4 On July 29, 2008, the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released by the Varese Sarabande label. The film score was composed by musician Tuomas Kantelinen.
Mongol premiered in theaters in wide release in Russia on September 20, 2007. It opened in the United States in limited release on June 6, 2008 grossing $5,705,761 in domestic ticket sales. It earned $20,821,749 in business through international release to top out at a combined $26,527,510 in gross revenue. The film was technically considered a minor financial success after its theatrical run, and was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas. The second installment of the trilogy, provisionally titled The Great Khan, entered pre-production in 2008 and was planned for a cinematic release in 2010.56
Plot
Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin (Tadanobu Asano) as a prisoner in the Tangut kingdom, conveys his memories about his earlier life through a series of flashbacks.
Embarking on an expedition as a young boy, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin (Odnyam Odsuren) is accompanied by his father Yes&lt;U+00FC&gt;gei (Ba Sen) to select a girl as his future wife. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin meets and chooses B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte (Bayertsetseg Erdenebat), although his father wishes him to choose a mate from the Merkit tribe. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin convinces his father to allow him to choose B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte. He promises to return after five years to marry her. On their way home, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin's father is poisoned by an enemy tribe. As he lies dying, he tells Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin that he is now Khan. However, one of his father's warriors, Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov), orders the other tribesmen to loot the dead Khan's camp. Targutai spares Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin's life, declaring a Mongol does not kill children. After falling through the ice of a frozen lake, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin is found lying down in the snow by a young boy called Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvshinbayar). The two quickly become friends and perform a traditional ceremony declaring themselves blood brothers. Targutai later captures Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin, holding him in captivity. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin however, escapes late one night and roams the countryside. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin is later seen again as a young man (Tadanobu Asano) in 1186. He once again is apprehended by Targutai, who wishes to kill him now that he is grown. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin escapes a second time finding B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte (Khulan Chuluun), and brings her back to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the Merkit tribe led by Chiledu (Sai Xing Ga), since Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin's father had years before stolen his wife from one of their tribesmen. While being chased on horseback, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin is shot with an arrow. B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte whips the horse which Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin is on, telling it to go home. B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte is captured by the Merkit leader, as Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin returns safely to his family.7
Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin goes to his childhood friend Jamukha (Sun Honglei), who is now a Khan himself. Jamukha agrees to help him get his wife back and attack the Merkit tribe, though only after a year passes. The attack on the Merkit tribe is a success, and Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin finds B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte alive and Chiledu dead. However, just as he feared, Bort&lt;U+00EB&gt; has already been raped and left pregnant with Chiledu's son, who Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin takes as his own. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin and his men leave early the next morning, and two of Jamukha's soldiers choose to join Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin because he distributes more plunder to his warriors than Jamukha. Jamukha chases down Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin, but Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin refuses to send back Jamukha's combatants and horses because he explains a Mongol warrior is free to choose his leader. Jamukha warns him that his actions will lead to future conflict. Taichar (Bu Ren), Jamukha's brother, is later killed while attempting to steal back Jamukha's horses; Jamukha and Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin go to war. Outnumbered, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin's army is quickly defeated. Jamukha declares victory and decides to make Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin a slave rather than execute him.8
Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin is sold to a Tangut Garrison Chief (Zhang Jiong), despite the dire warning given to the man by a Buddhist monk (Ben Hon Sun) acting as his advisor. While imprisoned, the monk pleads with Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin to save his monastery when he is set free sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte indicating that he is still alive, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin agrees. To get to Tangut, B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte becomes a merchant's concubine, bearing a daughter along the way. Once B&lt;U+00F6&gt;rte arrives in Tangut, she abandons the merchant and bribes the guard for the key to Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin's cell. Once freed, he gathers an army to unify all of the Mongols. In 1196, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin declares war over Jamukha. By 1206, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin defeats Jamukha (though he sets him free), while Targutai is killed by his own soldiers while attempting to flee the battle. Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin is subsequently designated the Khan of all the Mongols&lt;U+2013&gt;Genghis Khan of the Great Steppe.9

Production
Development
 The premise of Mongol is based on the true story of Genghis Khan, the Mongol leader who founded the Mongol Empire, which ruled expansive areas of Central Asia and China.10 The film depicts a portrait of the early life of Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin; not as an evil war-mongering brute, but rather an inspiring visionary leader.11 Director Bodrov noted that &quot;Russians lived under Mongolian rule for around 200 years&quot; and that &quot;Genghis Khan was portrayed as a monster&quot;. During the 1990s, Bodrov read a book by Russian historian Lev Gumilev entitled The Legend of the Black Arrow. Gumilev's book offered a more disciplined view of the Mongol leader which influenced Bodrov to create a film project about the warrior.12
Bodrov spent several years researching the aspects of his story, discovering that Khan was an orphan, a slave and a combatant who everyone tried to kill.13 He found difficulty in preparing the screenplay for the film due to the fact that no contemporary Mongol biography existed. The only Mongol history from the era, was a short poem written by an unknown author entitled The Secret History of Mongols. Author Gumilev had used the poem as a historical reference and a work of significant literature.14 Casting for the film took place worldwide, including Mongolia; China; Russia; and in Los Angeles.15 Speaking on the choice of Tadanobu Asano to portray Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin, Bodrov commented that although it might have seemed odd to cast a Japanese actor in the role, he explained that the Mongol ruler was seen by many Japanese as one of their own. Bodrov said, &quot;The Japanese had a very famous ancient warrior who disappeared, and they think he went to Mongolia and became Genghis Khan. He's a national hero, Genghis Khan. Mongolians can claim he's Mongolian, but the Japanese, they think they know who he is.&quot;16 Bodrov felt casting actor Sun Honglei was a perfect mix of &quot;gravity and humor&quot; for the role. Describing the character interaction between Asano and Honglei, he noted &quot;They're completely different people, Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin and Jamukha, but they have a strong relationship, strong feelings between them.&quot; Aside from the Chinese and Japanese actors for those roles, the rest of the cast were Mongolian.17
Filming
 Production for Mongol began in 2005, lasting 25 weeks and taking place in China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Production designer Dashi Namdakov helped to recreate the pastoral lifestyle of the nomadic tribesmen.18 Namdakov is originally from a Russian region which borders Mongolia and is home to many ethnic Mongols. Bodrov remarked, &quot;Dashi has the Mongol culture in his bones and knows how to approach this material.&quot;19 To help create some of the horse-mounted stunt sequences, Bodrov called upon seasoned stuntmen from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, whom he was familiar with during the production of Nomad.20 Describing some of the stunt work, Bodrov claimed: &quot;Not a single horse was hurt on this film. There's a line in the movie, when young Jamukha tells Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin, 'For Mongol, horse is more important than woman.' And that's how it is with the Kazakh and Kyrgyz stunt people. They took very good care of the horses and were very conscientious.&quot; Bodrov collaborated on the film with editors Zach Staenberg, who previously worked with The Matrix and Vald&lt;U+00ED&gt;s &lt;U+00D3&gt;skarsd&lt;U+00F3&gt;ttir, whose previous film work included Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.21
Soundtrack
The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for Mongol, was released by the Varese Sarabande music label on July 29, 2008.22 The score for the film was composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, with additional music orchestrated by the Mongolian folk rock band Altan Urag.23 Director Bodrov had attended a concert with Altan Urag and fell in love with their unique sound.24 He remarked how they displayed &quot;an amazing energy&quot;. Bodrov asked the band to contribute music to the film to lend strength to the battle scenes with Tem&lt;U+00FC&gt;jin.25 Finnish composer Kantelinen added an orchestral score to complement the lush, landscape filled backgrounds.26

Reception
Critical response
Among mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received mostly positive reviews.34 Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of 98 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7.1 out of 10.35 At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics' reviews, the film received a score of 74 based on 27 reviews.36 Alternately though, the film was criticized in Mongolia due to its factual errors and historical inaccuracies.37
&quot;Centered on the rise of Genghis Khan, the film is an enthralling tale, in the style of a David Lean saga, with similarly gorgeous cinematography. It combines a sprawling adventure saga with romance, family drama and riveting action sequences.&quot;
&lt;U+2014&gt;Claudia Puig, writing in USA Today38
Jonathan Kiefer, writing in the Sacramento News &amp; Review, said in outward praise, &quot;At once sweeping and intimately confidential, with durably magnetic performances by Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s Asano Tadanobu as the adored warlord and China&lt;U+2019&gt;s Honglei Sun as Jamukha, his blood brother and eventual enemy, Mongol, a 2007 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominee, has to be by far the best action epic of 12th- and 13th-century Asian nomads you&lt;U+2019&gt;ll see&quot;. He emphatically believed Bodrov's film was &quot;both ancient and authentic.&quot; He added that it was &quot;commendably unhurried, and the scope swells up in a way that feels organic to a character-driven story&quot;.39 Left equally impressed, Walter Addiego in the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote that the film offers &quot;everything you would want from an imposing historical drama: furious battles between mass armies, unquenchable love between husband and wife, blood brothers who become deadly enemies, and many episodes of betrayal and treachery&quot;. Concerning cinematography, he believed the film included &quot;plenty of haunting landscapes, gorgeously photographed by Sergei Trofimov on location in China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, along with the sort of warfare scenes that define epics&quot;.40 Claudia Puig of USA Today, said the film &quot;has a visceral energy with powerful battle sequences and also scenes of striking and serene physical beauty.&quot; Noting a flaw, she did comment that Mongol might have included &quot;one battle too many.&quot; Although overall, she concluded the film was &quot;an exotic saga that compels, moves and envelops us with its grand and captivating story.&quot;41 The film however, was not without its detractors. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle, viewed the film as &quot;broken, beleaguered,&quot; and a &quot;belittled nation's payback for the indignities inflicted upon them by Borat.&quot;42 Also in lackluster fashion, Kyle Smith of the New York Post commented that the film combined the &quot;intelligence of an action movie with the excitement of an art-house release&quot; making Mongol &quot;as dry as summer in the Gobi Desert.&quot; Smith did compliment director Bodrov on staging a &quot;couple of splattery yet artful battle scenes&quot;. But ultimately thought the film &quot;really isn't worth leaving your yurt for.&quot;43 Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out, added to the negative sentiment by saying Mongol was a &quot;Russian-produced dud.&quot; He noted that it included &quot;Ridiculous dialogue and Neanderthal motivations&quot; as well as bearing &quot;little relation to the raw, immediate work of his countrymates&lt;U+2014&gt;like Andrei Tarkovsky, whose epic Andrei Rublev really gives you a sense of the dirt and desperation.&quot;44
Writing for The Boston Globe, Wesley Morris exuberantly exclaimed that Mongol &quot;actually works as an old-fashioned production - one with breathtaking mohawks, a scary yoking, one daring escape, hottish sex, ice, snow, braying sheep, blood oaths, dehydrating dunes, throat singing, a nighttime urination, kidnapping, charged reunions, and relatively authentic entertainment values.&quot;45 Film critic Roger Ebert writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, called the film a &quot;visual spectacle, it is all but overwhelming, putting to shame some of the recent historical epics from Hollywood.&quot; Summing up, Ebert wrote &quot;The nuances of an ancient and ingeniously developed culture are passed over, and it cannot be denied that Mongol is relentlessly entertaining as an action picture.&quot;46 Describing an unfavorable opinion, author Tom Hoskyns of The Independent described the film as being &quot;very thin plot-wise.&quot; Hoskyns commended the &quot;desolate landscapes and seasonal variations&quot;, but he was not excited about the repetitious nature of the story showing the &quot;hero getting repeatedly captured and escaping.&quot;47
&quot;Mongol is a ferocious film, blood-soaked, pausing occasionally for passionate romance and more frequently for torture.&quot;
&lt;U+2014&gt;Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times48
A.O. Scott of The New York Times, stated that Mongol was a &quot;big, ponderous epic, its beautifully composed landscape shots punctuated by thundering hooves and bloody, slow-motion battle sequences.&quot;49 Scott approved of how the film encompassed &quot;rich ethnographic detail and enough dramatic intrigue to sustain a viewer&lt;U+2019&gt;s interest through the slower stretches.&quot;50 Similarly, Joe Morgenstern wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the film consisted of battle scenes which were as &quot;notable for their clarity as their intensity; we can follow the strategies, get a sense of who's losing and who's winning. The physical production is sumptuous.&quot; Morgenstern affirmed that Mongol was &quot;an austere epic that turns the stuff of pulp adventure into a persuasive take on ancient history.&quot;51 Lisa Schwarzbaum writing for Entertainment Weekly asserted the visual qualities of the film, remarking how Mongol &quot;contrasts images of sweeping landscape and propulsive battle with potent scenes of emotional intimacy&quot;, while also referring to its &quot;quite grand, quite exotic, David Lean-style epic&quot; resemblance.52
