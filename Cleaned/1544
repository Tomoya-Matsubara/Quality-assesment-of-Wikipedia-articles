Michael Shawn Hickenbottom1 (born July 22 1965),2 better known by his ring name Shawn Michaels, is an American professional wrestler. He performs on the RAW brand of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), though he is currently out of action because of a legitimate knee surgery. His absence is being portrayed on television as the result of a serious concussion inflicted by Randy Orton.3
As of 2007, Hickenbottom is one of the longest-tenured performers in WWE, having joined in 1987. He is one of only two wrestlers to have appeared on the very first episode of RAW is WAR who are still with the company today. The other is The Undertaker. However, he was inactive in the company from 1998-2002 due to a severe back injury.4
Before coming to World Wrestling Entertainment, Hickenbottom began his career in Mid-South Wrestling in 1984. He then went on to Texas All-Star Wrestling. He made his national debut with the American Wrestling Association in 1986. He signed with World Wrestling Federation in 1987 while still under contract with AWA. He returned to AWA, only to go back to World Wrestling Federation in 1988.
Hickenbottom is a four-time World Champion, three-time as WWF Champion, and a one-time World Heavyweight Champion. He was also the winner of the 1995 and 1996 Royal Rumbles.
Career
Early career
Michaels was born on July 22 1965 in Chandler, Arizona. The last of four children - Randy, Scott and Shari. He was raised in a military family, he spent a brief part of his early years in Reading, Berkshire, England, but mainly grew up in San Antonio, Texas. He knew he wanted to become a professional wrestler at the age of 12. He was already an athlete; his career began at the age of 6 when he started playing Football, becoming a stand-out Linebacker; he attended Randolph High School5 and eventually becoming Captain of the football team. After graduating he attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. But soon he realized that the college life was not for him. Then he began pursuing the career of a professional wrestler.
He was then trained by Mexican professional wrestler Jose Lothario, Michaels debuted in 1984, working with Mid-South Wrestling and later Texas All-Star Wrestling promotion, where he and Paul Diamond were awarded the TAW Tag Team Championship by Chavo Guerrero, Sr.6
Michaels also wrestled for Central States Championship Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner Marty Jannetty defeated The Batten Twins for the Central States Tag Team Championship,7 later losing it back to the Battens. Michaels also made several appearances in the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling throughout 1985.
American Wrestling Association (1986-1988)
Michaels made his national-level debut in 1986 in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), once again teaming with Jannetty. The pair were billed as &quot;The Midnight Rockers&quot; and won the AWA World Tag Team Championship twice.8 They also appeared in the Mid-South on loan at this point. In a raid of AWA talent in 1987, The Rockers were signed by a competing promotion: the World Wrestling Federation. However, they were fired two weeks later for &quot;partying too hard&quot; (a misunderstanding, according to Michaels' autobiography). They returned to the AWA, but were re-signed by the WWF a year later.
World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1988-1998, 2002-present)
1988-1991
They redebuted at a house show on July 7 1988.9 Because of WWF chairman Vince McMahon's desire to have his performers carry WWF-exclusive monikers, they were repackaged as just &quot;The Rockers&quot;.
The team proved popular with both children and women, as well as 'smart' fans who appreciated technical wrestling. The team were mid-card stalwarts of TV and pay-per-view shows for the next two years, but never seemed to get a fair chance at the WWF's Tag Team Championships.
Their chance belatedly came in October 1990: The Rockers were scheduled to win the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Hart Foundation. Jim Neidhart, half of the championship team, was in the process of negotiating his release from the company. The match was taped with The Rockers fairly winning the belts, but soon after, Neidhart came to a stopgap agreement with management and was rehired. The belts were returned to the Harts, while the change was never broadcast or even acknowledged on TV. When news spread, WWF explained that the original result was void due to a collapsed turnbuckle in the ring during the bout. A buckle had indeed broken, but not to a noticeable or dangerous extent during the match. The duo plodded along, eventually splitting on December 2 1991 during an incident on Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake's televised &quot;Barber Shop&quot; talk show segment. Michaels superkicked Jannetty and threw him through a glass window on the &quot;shop&quot; set. Jannetty vanished from the WWF and Michaels turned heel as &quot;The Boy Toy&quot;.
1992-1993
His nickname was later changed to &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;, at Curt Hennig's suggestion.10
In his new gimmick as a vain, cocky heel named The Heartbreak Kid, he was put together with mirror-carrying manager &quot;Sensational&quot; Sherri, who, according to the storyline, had become infatuated with him. Sherri even sang the first version of his new theme music &quot;Sexy Boy.&quot; During that period, Michaels normally wrestled during the first half of house shows, and had his departure announced with the words &quot;Shawn Michaels has left the building&quot; (alluding to the phrase &quot;Elvis has left the building&quot;).
Michaels failed to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart in July 1992, even losing the WWF's first ever Ladder match against him at a House show. Still, Michaels was beginning to get over as a heel. He won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from &quot;The British Bulldog&quot; during Saturday Night's Main Event on October 27 1992. Shortly thereafter, he was in a PPV main event for the first time, facing &lt;U+2014&gt; and losing to &lt;U+2014&gt; future nemesis Bret Hart, for the WWF Championship at the 1992 Survivor Series.11 They were moved to the main event after The Ultimate Warrior left WWF suddenly, leaving his tag-team match with Randy Savage against Ric Flair and Razor Ramon hanging. The &quot;Champion vs. Champion&quot; match stole the show.
Michaels and Sherri split at this point, and Jannetty quickly reappeared, leading to several memorable matches. After sneaking past Tatanka in early 1993, Michaels lost his Intercontinental Championship to Jannetty on Monday Night RAW on May 17 1993.12 He then regained it on June 6 1993 with the help of his debuting &quot;bodyguard&quot; (and off-air friend) Diesel.13
After a much-hyped but ultimately disappointing feud with Mr. Perfect, Michaels quit the WWF in September 1993. It was announced that Michaels had failed to defend his belt enough times during a set period; in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for steroids &lt;U+2014&gt; a charge that Michaels denies to this day. After turning down WCW's advances, Michaels returned to the WWF and made several appearances in the United States Wrestling Association during a WWF/USWA cross-promotion. He returned to WWF television for November's Survivor Series, substituting for the arrested Jerry Lawler in a match pitting himself and three of Lawler's &quot;Knights&quot; against Bret, Bruce, Keith, and Owen Hart.14
1994-1995
He soon entered a feud with Razor Ramon, who had won the vacated Intercontinental Title during Michaels' absence. Since Michaels had never been defeated in the ring for the title, he claimed to be the rightful champion and even carried around his old title belt. This feud culminated in a ladder match between the two at WrestleMania X. Michaels lost the match, which featured both his and Ramon's belts suspended above a ladder in the ring.15 This match won &quot;Match of the Year&quot; awards from Pro Wrestling Illustrated16 and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. It also earned Michaels a reputation of being the &quot;Innovator of the Ladder Match&quot; when, in reality, it was Bret Hart who brought in the idea two years previously from his experience in Stampede Wrestling where the Ladder Match had been used since the 1970s.
Michaels battled various injuries over the next few months and soon launched the &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; TV talk show segment, mainly shown on WWF Superstars.
On August 28 1994, Michaels and his ever more popular sidekick, Diesel, captured the WWF World Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers. During their brief time as a tag team, they used a variation of the Headshrinkers' finishing move, where Michaels finished off their opponent by climbing on Diesel's shoulders and splashing on their opponents. The next day, at SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Title to Ramon when Michaels accidentally Superkicked his bodyguard.17 This triggered a Michaels-Diesel split, drawn out until the Survivor Series that November due to Michaels' hand injury at the time.18 Michaels went on to win the 1995 Royal Rumble, where he was the first Royal Rumble participant to win the match from the No.1 spot.19 This set up a championship/grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel. Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match,20 and was attacked by Sid the following night. Michaels took time off.
He returned to the ring as a 'babyface' in June 1995 and defeated Jeff Jarrett in July for his third Intercontinental Title. This led to a title defense against Razor Ramon at SummerSlam, in a Ladder Match, which Michaels won.21 Around this time, Michaels became the alleged leader of a backstage group known as The Clique/Kliq, which others perceived had sufficient clout with WWF owner Vince McMahon, to become the dominant wrestling figures in the promotion for several years in the mid-1990s. Michaels disputes the perception, saying that McMahon pushed only deserving wrestlers. Michaels fan base was later nicknamed &quot;The Kliq&quot; as an inside reference to the real &quot;Clique.&quot;
In October 1995, he was legitimately attacked by several men outside a bar in Syracuse, New York. Shortly afterwards, at the In Your House: Great White North PPV, Michaels forfeited the Intercontinental Title to rival Dean Douglas because he was, according to the WWF, unable to compete. However, Douglas lost the title immediately to Clique member Razor Ramon.22 Douglas maintained that Michaels could have wrestled that night and simply did not want to put him over.
The next month, during a match with Owen Hart on Monday Night RAW, Owen nailed Michaels with an Enzuigiri kick to the back of Michaels' head. They continued to wrestle, but Michaels collapsed in the ring, supposedly because he had suffered a concussion in the Syracuse incident.23 The concussion was a work, skillfully kept from most fans at the time.
1996-1997
After teasing a retirement, Michaels announced that he would be returning to the WWF at the 1996 Royal Rumble match, which he won for the second year in a row.24 Around this time, Jose Lothario, Michaels' original trainer, became his on-screen manager.
Michaels won his first WWF Championship at WrestleMania XII in March 1996, pinning Bret Hart in the 'sudden death' overtime of their a sixty minute Iron Man match, which had ended in a 0-0 tie.25 As WCW gained momentum due to the signings of Michaels' friends Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, Michaels soldiered on as champion for most of the year, notably overcoming Mankind,26 Vader,27 and The British Bulldog28 in pay-per-view battles.
Michaels' title reign ended at the 1996 Survivor Series in November, where he lost to Sycho Sid, his former bodyguard, at Madison Square Garden in a face vs. face match. This match was notable for the New York fans cheering for Sid when he hit both Michaels and Jose Lothario with a television camera and cheering again when he won the match and championship.29 A flu-ridden Michaels recaptured the belt from Sid in January at the 1997 Royal Rumble in front of his hometown fans in San Antonio.30
On a special episode of RAW dubbed Thursday RAW Thursday,31 Michaels vacated the WWF title;32 he explained to the fans that he was informed by doctors that a knee injury was bad enough that he had to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted that he was going to have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he &quot;had to find his smile again&quot;, which he had &quot;lost&quot; somewhere down the line.33
After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, he returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Titles.34 However, after a real life backstage fight with Bret Hart, Michaels quit the WWF, until Vince McMahon convinced Michaels otherwise, and gave him the role of a heel.
At SummerSlam 1997, Michaels officiated the WWF title match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels nailing Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the title to his nemesis, Bret Hart. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the WWF European Championship when he passed out in the Figure Four Leg Lock.35 The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they almost rioted and booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with rubbish.36 Michaels' striking of the Undertaker with a chair began a feud between the two men. In October, at In Your House: Badd Blood, Michaels and Undertaker participated in the very first Hell in a Cell match, which saw Michaels falling off the side of the 15-foot high structure through a table. Michaels won the match with the help of the Undertaker's brother Kane, who made his debut.37
In the summer, Michaels joined forces with real-life friend, Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Hunter's then-girlfriend, Chyna to form D-Generation X. The group engaged in rebellious behavior, such as using the DX slogan &quot;Suck it!&quot;, in addition to the crotch chop towards other wrestlers, and sometimes fans. Moving away from the family-oriented product, this marked the beginning of the WWF Attitude Era. Michaels also began re-feuding with Bret Hart's reformed Hart Foundation, which was now a pro-Canada stable. Michaels taunted The Hart Foundation and Canada by engaging in acts, such as blowing his nose with and humping the Canadian Flag. In his book, Heartbreak &amp; Triumph, Michaels claims the flag desecration was Bret Hart's idea.
Michaels' feud with the Hart Foundation culminated in a title shot at the 1997 Survivor Series against Bret Hart in what is thought to be the most controversial match in wrestling history. Michaels came out of this match, dubbed by fans the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;, as the WWF World Champion.38 Michaels thus became the only wrestler to hold both the World Championship and the European Championship at the same time. However, he had Triple H pin him in December in a farcical match, making Hunter the European Champion.39
1998-Injury
In 1998, Michaels received a back injury in the Casket match against the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble40; Michaels took a back body drop to the outside and smashed his lower back on the casket, causing him to herniate two discs and crush one completely. This forced Michaels into retirement after losing the WWF Championship to Steve Austin at WrestleMania XIV.41 Prior to losing the belt, Michaels, along with DX allies, made regular appearances much like Steve Austin did the previous year after injuring his neck at SummerSlam. Wrestlers such as Bret Hart, as Michaels reveals in his autobiography, did interviews on live television claiming that Michaels was faking his whole injury. Bret later apologized for these events.
Michaels returned to the WWF on November 23 1998, but not as a wrestler; instead, he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF Commissioner, joining Vince McMahon's Corporation stable as a heel.42 Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular TV appearances, booking matches, stamping down his authority, and sometimes deciding the outcome of matches. In early 1999, Michaels turned face and re-joined D-Generation X, but disappeared from WWF television for a few months, and by the time he had returned DX had broken up.
Michaels made occasional appearances on WWF television as commissioner as a face during the spring and summer of 1999. He was supposed to turn heel once again during the premiere episode of SmackDown! on August 26 1999 when, while serving as a special guest referee, he superkicked The Rock, allowing Triple H to retain the WWF Championship.43 However, Michaels did not appear on WWF television until May 21 2000, as a face, to officiate the Iron Man match between the Rock and Triple H.44 He made one last appearance a month later, when he handed over the role of commissioner to Mick Foley, becoming the official spokesperson for the WWF. Michaels then disappeared from WWF television for nearly a year.
Michaels' prolonged absences were the result of his opening of the Shawn Michaels Wrestling Academy in early 1999. In February 2001, Michaels signed a multi year contract extension with the WWF.
2002-Return to RAW
In 2002, Michaels returned to wrestling, brought in by Kevin Nash as a new member of the nWo.45 After the nWo was disbanded, Triple H apparently wanted to mend ties with Michaels. This was solidified when Michaels beseeched Triple H to return to RAW. Later on, they came down to the ring with their D-Generation X music and attire. When they were about to do their trademark &quot;Suck It&quot; taunt, Triple H nailed Michaels with the Pedigree.46 A week later, Triple H attacked Michaels from behind in a parking lot and put his head through a car window.47 Michaels surprised everyone by challenging Triple H to &quot;a fight&quot; (a non-sanctioned match) at SummerSlam, which Triple H accepted.
Michaels returned to the ring to wrestle a match against Triple H at SummerSlam 2002, laying the foundation for a feud that lasted for years. This match was noted for Michaels' emotional in-ring return after more than four years on the shelf. Michaels won at SummerSlam but was attacked with a sledgehammer by Triple H after the match.48
At Survivor Series 2002, Michaels won the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H in the first-ever Elimination Chamber match, which also featured Rob Van Dam, Kane, Chris Jericho, and Booker T. Michaels eliminated both Jericho and Triple H to win the match.49 This title win marked the first time in WWE history that a wrestler won a World Championship in any type of steel cage match. A month later, Michaels lost the World Championship to Triple H in a Three Stages Of Hell match at Armageddon.50
2003-2004
 Michaels then proceeded to feud with Chris Jericho. On January 13 2003, Jericho won an over-the-top-rope challenge to select his entry number for the Royal Rumble, choosing number two in order to start the match with Michaels,51 who had already been named number one. At the Royal Rumble, Jericho, with the help of Christian, eliminated Michaels.52 Michaels defeated Jericho at WrestleMania XIX. After the match, HBK offered his hand to Jericho who, instead of shaking it, hugged Michaels. At first it seemed like good sportsmanship by Chris Jericho but he quickly kicked Michaels in the groin.53
At SummerSlam 2003 Michaels competed in the second-ever Elimination Chamber Match, which also featured Randy Orton, Kevin Nash, Chris Jericho, Goldberg, and eventual winner, World Heavyweight Champion, Triple H. During the match, he helped Chris Jericho eliminate Kevin Nash, which prompted Nash to attack both men before exiting the chamber. Later in the match, Michaels was eliminated by Goldberg.54 He then went on to feud with Evolution member Randy Orton, who defeated him at Unforgiven.55 At Survivor Series, Team Austin consisted of (HBK, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, and The Dudley Boyz) faced-off with Team Bischoff (Scott Steiner, Mark Henry, Chris Jericho, Christian, and Randy Orton). During the match, Evolution member Batista interfered and gave Michaels the Batista Bomb, costing him the match.56 Michaels then entered a feud with Batista; the two met at Armageddon, there Michaels went onto defeat Batista.57
Michaels went on to be in the main event of WrestleMania XX as part of an ongoing feud with Triple H, where he came up short in a match against Triple H and Chris Benoit for the World Heavyweight Championship.58 At Bad Blood in June, Michaels lost to Triple H in a Hell in a Cell match.59 The next night on RAW, Kane attacked Michaels with a steel chair, injuring him (kayfabe) in the process.60 Michaels made his return at Unforgiven and defeated Kane in a No Disqualification Match.61 Two months later, he lost a World Heavyweight Championship match against Triple H (after Edge interfered) at Taboo Tuesday 2004 when the fans voted for him ahead of Edge and Chris Benoit to face Triple H one more time.62 Following this, Michaels was out of action for a few months with a legitimate torn meniscus.
2005-2006
Michaels returned in January 2005 as the special guest referee in the Elimination Chamber Match (which featured Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Edge, Randy Orton, Batista, and eventual winner Triple H) at New Year's Revolution 2005.63 During the match, Michaels superkicked Edge, starting a feud between the two.64
At the 2005 Royal Rumble, Edge defeated Michaels, who pinned him using the ropes for leverage.65 Michaels went on to compete in the Rumble match later that night and eliminated Kurt Angle. An angry Angle returned to the ring and eliminated Michaels and then put Michaels in the Ankle Lock.66 Michaels issued a challenge to Angle for a match at WrestleMania 21, which Angle accepted when he appeared on RAW to attack Michaels.67 The following week on RAW, Marty Jannetty and Michaels had a one time reunion as The Rockers and defeated La R&lt;U+00E9&gt;sistance.68 Three days later on SmackDown!, Angle defeated Jannetty with the Ankle Lock.69 To send a &quot;message&quot; to Michaels; Angle also humiliated HBK's former manager Sensational Sherri, when he applied the Ankle Lock on her.70 At WrestleMania 21 on April 3 2005, Angle defeated Michaels by submission, again with the Ankle Lock.71
The next night on RAW, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault Michaels.72 The following week, Michaels approached RAW General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused but informed Michaels to find a partner and he would grant a match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan to come back and team with him.73 On the April 18 2005 episode of RAW, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer.74 At Backlash 2005, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels when Daivari was pinned.75
On the July 4 2005 edition of RAW, Michaels and Hulk Hogan had a tag team match, in which they ended up winning. During the post-match pose, Michaels hit Hogan with his Superkick, knocking Hogan to the ground and turning Michaels heel for the first time since returning in 2002.76 The following week on RAW, HBK appeared on Piper's Pit where he superkicked Roddy Piper77 and then challenged Hulk Hogan to a match at SummerSlam.78 Prior to SummerSlam 2005, neither Hogan nor Michaels had lost in a one-on-one match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam. After the match Michaels extended his hand to him, saying &quot;I needed to know, and I found out&quot; and he and Hogan shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd and Michaels turned face once more.79
Michaels began a feud with Chris Masters. The pair faced each other in a match at Unforgiven 2005 where Michaels won via pinfall.80 At Taboo Tuesday 2005, Michaels won the fans choice for the second year running and became a part of the Triple Threat match with John Cena and Kurt Angle. Cena would retain the WWE Championship.81
On the December 26 2005 edition of RAW, Vince McMahon lauded Michaels for his part in the Montreal Screwjob. Michaels said he was only being loyal to his company, but said he had moved on and McMahon should move on as well. McMahon told Michaels he can &quot;screw&quot; him like he screwed Bret Hart,82 and he began setting unusual stipulations for Michaels' matches and interfering on behalf of Michaels' opponents.83
During the 2006 Royal Rumble, to which Michaels entered twenty fifth, he eliminated MNM and Shelton Benjamin in succession to make it into the final six. At that point, Mr. McMahon&lt;U+2019&gt;s music hit, and the Chairman made his entrance. As HBK stared down McMahon, Shane McMahon made a surprising appearance, attacking Michaels from behind and eliminating him from the match. An irate HBK ran back into the ring and nailed Triple H with Sweet Chin Music before chasing the McMahons to the locker room.84
After several weeks of attacks and stipulations, Michaels confronted McMahon in the ring and challenged him to a match. McMahon refused and attempted (unsuccessfully) to force Michaels to sign retirement papers.85 After Vince and Shane knocked HBK out with a steel chair,86 Mr. McMahon booked a match between himself and HBK at WrestleMania 22.87 During a handicap match against the Spirit Squad Michaels former partner Marty Jannetty came down to help Michaels.88 Mr. McMahon offered Jannetty a contract if he &quot;kissed his ass.&quot; The next week on RAW Jannetty refused and took Chris Masters' &quot;Masterlock challenge&quot; instead. Michaels tried to help Jannetty, which ultimately ended in Shane forcing a groggy Michaels to kiss Vince's ass.89
Michaels and Shane McMahon then met in a Street Fight at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event. Throughout the match, Vince interfered, allowing Shane to get the upper hand. However, Michaels kept kicking out and refused to submit. When he got the upper hand again by superkicking Shane, Vince knocked the ref down before the three count. Michaels went after Vince, which gave Shane enough time to hit Michaels with a low blow from behind. Shane applied the Sharpshooter, and Vince McMahon immediately ordered for the bell to be rung, even though Michaels did not tap out; an allusion to the Montreal Screwjob.90
Despite interference from the Spirit Squad and Shane McMahon, Michaels defeated Mr. McMahon at WrestleMania 22 in a bloody No Holds Barred match. The match is noted for being the start of the DX reunion that was soon to come.91 At Backlash 2006, Vince and Shane McMahon beat Michaels (with &quot;God&quot; as his tag team partner) with help from the Spirit Squad in a no DQ match; Michaels suffered a partially broken nose.92 Michaels got revenge on the Spirit Squad in various ways, but by May 22 2006 the Squad injured Michaels' knee; this angle was written so Michaels could have surgery on his knee, which had been legitimately injured for some time.93
Return of D-Generation X
 In 2006, a series of events took place which suggested a reunion of Shawn Michaels and Triple H as D-Generation X starting at WrestleMania 22 where both Michaels and Triple H performed the crotch chop during their matches.94 The two continued to deliver chops in the following episodes of WWE RAW as Michaels feuded with Vince McMahon and Triple H went for the WWE Championship, repeatedly butting heads with Vince McMahon in the process.
On the June 12 2006 edition of RAW, DX officially reunited. During Triple H's gauntlet match against the Spirit Squad, Michaels came in to help Triple H, and the two did the DX &quot;crotch chops.&quot;95 At Vengeance, DX defeated the Spirit Squad in a 5-on-2 handicap match.96 After the win, the group continued its sophomoric antics at the expense of The Spirit Squad, Vince McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Jonathan Coachman for several weeks. They then defeated the Spirit Squad at WWE Saturday Night's Main Event in a 5-2 elimination match97 and went on to defeat The McMahons (Vince and Shane) at SummerSlam.98 They defeated The McMahons again, but this match also involved Big Show in a Hell in a Cell match at Unforgiven.99
At Cyber Sunday, DX took on Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton). The fan-selected referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal use of a steel chair to give Rated RKO the ill-gotten win, and the plaudit of being the first tag team to defeat DX in a tag team match since their reformation in June 2006.100 However, at Survivor Series, Team DX emerged victorious, in a clean sweep of Team Rated-RKO.101
2007
 At New Year's Revolution, Michaels' partner, Triple H suffered a (legit) torn right quadriceps during their match with Rated-RKO.102 Rated-RKO claimed victory over DX, citing the injury as the &quot;end&quot; of DX.103 On January 15 2007, HBK lived up to his vow of &quot;dealing&quot; with Rated-RKO when he took out Randy Orton with a con-chair-to after a handicap match against Edge and Orton.104
On the January 29 2007 edition of RAW, Michaels captured the World Tag Team Championship for the fourth time from Rated-RKO alongside WWE Champion John Cena.105 He then won a Triple Threat Number One contender's match on another edition of RAW to earn a shot at the WWE Championship.106 On April 1 at WrestleMania 23, Cena defeated Michaels in the main event, with the WWE Championship on the line, after he was forced to submit to the STFU.107 The next night on RAW, Michaels and Cena competed in two back-to back 10 team battle royals, winning the first against Booker T and Finlay, and lost the tag team titles in the 2nd battle royal when Michaels threw Cena over the top rope. The eventual winners were the The Hardys.108
Michaels' feud with Cena continued and he faced off with Cena, Edge, and Randy Orton in a Fatal Four Way match at Backlash for the WWE Championship. Cena retained the title once again when Michaels hit the Sweet Chin Music on Cena causing him to fall on Orton, which gained Cena the pinfall.109
The Great Khali defeated Michaels in a no disqualification #1 contender's match when he was choke bombed through the announce table, causing the referee to end the match. Michaels then entered a feud with Randy Orton when Orton claimed that he could beat Michaels. Michaels then faced off against Orton at Judgment Day. The week before the match, Michaels was attacked by Orton twice after his match with Edge110 and backstage at Judgment Day, (which contributed to his injury from The Great Khali); Orton went on to defeat Michaels, when he collapsed during the match. Michaels was then joined by his wife, Rebecca, in the ring and taken out of the arena on a stretcher.111

Entrance music
The song Sexy Boy was originally written for Michaels by Jimmy Hart. Hart thanked Michaels personally for continuing to use the song as his entrance music when he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005. Michaels' entrance music was originally performed by Sherri Martel until she became a babyface, and then the second version was performed by Shawn Michaels himself with traces of Sherri in the chorus portion of the song. The current version of the song in use today is the version Michaels sung himself. Michaels says that the song was the product of &quot;magic&quot; because how it originally sounded right after recording was simply &quot;brutal.&quot;
Since the return of DX, Michaels mostly used the DX entrance Break It Down, by The Chris Warren Band, even when wrestling in singles competition, but then went back to using Sexy Boy.

Personal life
Growing up, Michaels was never called &quot;Michael&quot; because he hated the name, so his family and friends just called him &quot;Shawn&quot;. Ever since, he's been referred to as Shawn.146
In 1996, Michaels posed in a non-nude layout for Playgirl magazine.147
Michaels' marriage to his first wife, Theresa, was brief and ended in divorce.148 He is now married to former WCW Nitro Girl, Whisper (Rebecca Curci). They were married on March 31 1999 at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada.149 It was a very small wedding ceremony. The only people present were Michaels, Rebecca Curci, and an Elvis impersonator. Michaels and Curci have a son, Cameron Kade (born on January 5 2000)150 and a daughter, Cheyenne Michelle (born on August 19 2004)151
Michaels has several tattoos. He has a tattoo of a heart with a sword through it with what appears to be a snake around it in the shape of an &quot;S&quot;. He has one on his wedding finger, that has an R for his wife Rebecca. Another in his left wrist, it's a bracelet design that says: Cameron for his son. On his left leg he has a picture of his wife, the other leg has a picture of the state of Texas. Finally, he has a small broken heart with the letters &quot;HBK&quot; above it, tattooed on his right hip.
Michaels' return to the WWE at SummerSlam 2002 was supposed to be a 'one night only' show; Jim Ross even informed the audience that &quot;Michaels is gonna leave us with something to remember him by&quot; and &quot;this is a one night performance from Shawn Michaels&quot;. However, after discovering he could still perform 100% in the ring, he gradually went back into wrestling full-time.
Michaels is ambidextrous. He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write. He typically uses his right leg to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but sometimes uses his left leg for an enzuigiri kick.
Michaels is a born again Christian. His ring attire often incorporates cross symbols, and while on the way to the ring, he normally gets down on his knees and mouths a prayer while his pyrotechnics go off. He has been seen in the congregation during a televised service of Cornerstone Church in his hometown of San Antonio. He also appeared on a Trinity Broadcasting Network program along with Sting.152153154
He is a fan of the San Antonio Spurs. He has been seen wearing Spurs merchandise and attending Spurs games. JBL made a reference to Michaels being a season ticket holder during the 2007 Royal Rumble Match.
Michaels is the cousin of former TNA talent Matt Bentley.
