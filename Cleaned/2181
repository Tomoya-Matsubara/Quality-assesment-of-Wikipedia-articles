Bury St Edmunds railway station serves the town of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, England. The station, and all trains calling there, are operated by 'one'.
Architecture and layout
Designed by Sancton Wood (the architect also of Ipswich and Cambridge railway stations as well as many stations in Ireland, the principal of which is Heuston Station, Dublin), the station was formally inaugurated in November 1847, eleven months after the opening of the Eastern Union Railway's line from Ipswich.
The most noteworthy feature of the station, which is constructed of red brick with stone dressings, is a pair of towers (originally linked by an overall roof, removed in 1893) on either side of the tracks at the eastern end of the layout. As first built – as a terminus – the station had four tracks, although in practice only one platform was used before the line was extended to Newmarket in 1854. Today a wide space separates the two surviving through tracks, which serve Platform 1 (for trains from Ipswich) and Platform 2 (called at by those heading east).12
The semi-elliptical brick arch bridge over Northgate Road to the east of the station, which like the station building is a Grade II listed building, has been credited to Frederick Barnes and Charles Russell.
Derailment
Due to the freight train derailment on a bridge near Ely, trains to Peterborough from London terminate at Bury St Edmunds with a replacement bus service in operation
