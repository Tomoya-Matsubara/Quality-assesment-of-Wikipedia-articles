 Damper is a traditional Australian outback soda bread prepared by swagmen, drovers and other travellers. It consists of a wheat flour based bread, traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire. Damper is an iconic Australian dish.
Damper was originally developed by stockmen who travelled in remote areas for weeks with only basic rations of flour, preserved meat, butter, tea and sugar to live on. The basic ingredients were flour, water, salt and sometimes milk. Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) could be used for leavening. The damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the camp fire. The ashes were flattened and the damper was placed in there for ten minutes to cook. Following this, the damper was covered with ashes and cooked for another 20 to 30 minutes until the damper sounded hollow when tapped. Alternatively, the damper was cooked in a greased camp oven.
Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup, also known as &quot;cocky's joy&quot;. It was traditionally served with a cup of tea, made in a billy of course, or even a swig of Bundaberg Rum.
Damper is also a popular dish with Indigenous Australians. Aboriginal women had traditionally made bush bread from seasonal grains and nuts, which they cooked in the ashes of fires.
It also became a popular dish for recreational campers and has become available in bakeries. Many variations and recipes exist, some authentic, others using the name to sell a more palatable bread product to the urban public.
