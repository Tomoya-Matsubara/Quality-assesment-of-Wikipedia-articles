James Lance Bass12 (born May 4 1979), known as Lance Bass (IPA pronunciation: ),3 is an American pop singer, actor, producer and author who is best known as the bass singer for the American pop boy band 'N Sync. After the dissolution of 'N Sync, Bass began acting in film and television, starting with a lead role in the 2001 film On The Line, which was produced by his film production company, Bacon &amp; Eggs. In addition, Bass formed a separate production company, Lance Bass Productions,4 as well as a now-defunct music management company, Free Lance Entertainment, which was a joint venture with Mercury Records.5
Bass is also known for his 2002 attempt at space travel, for which he moved to Star City, Russia and entered cosmonaut training. Bass was eventually certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program for a mission aboard a Soyuz space capsule to the International Space Station.6 However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied a seat on the mission.7
In July 2006, Bass revealed that he was gay in a front page cover story for People magazine, which received major media attention.8 Subsequently, Bass's romantic life became regular blog and tabloid fodder. He was awarded the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award in October 2006,9 and released an autobiography, Out of Sync, on October 23, 2007.10
Biography
Early life
James Lance Bass was born to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a medical lab technician, and Diane Bass, a middle school mathematics teacher,11 in Laurel, Mississippi.12 He has one older sister named Stacy.13 Bass was raised in the town of Ellisville, Mississippi as &quot;a strict Southern Baptist, in the steep shadow of the church&quot;, and has described his family as a &quot;completely traditional Southern family&quot;.14 At a young age, Bass developed a fascination with space, and, at age 9, traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida with his father and grandfather to watch his first live space shuttle launch. Of this experience he said, &quot;I was certain from then on that that my future was to be involved with space.&quot;15 Bass attended space camp the following year,16 and aspired to attend college and study engineering, with the hope that he would one day work for NASA.17
When Bass was 10 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family packed up and moved to Clinton, Mississippi.18 There, Bass began singing in his church choir and as a chorus member in his school. While a student at Clinton High School, Bass joined Mississippi Show Stoppers, a state-wide group sponsored by the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum, and was a member of Attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;, a competitive show choir group that traveled across the country.19 One of Bass's vocal coaches during his time in the Mississippi Show Stoppers was Bob Westbrook, a professional vocal coach who had previously worked with young performers Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears.20 Westbrook's connection to Timberlake would later play a large role in Bass joining 'N Sync.
Along with being a member of the Showstoppers and Attach&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Bass was a member of a seven-man vocal group called Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for Senator Trent Lott.21 Bass was also elected vice president of his junior class, and has said that he was &quot;extremely popular&quot; among the female contingent of his high school because, &quot;I never tried to do anything that was considered too forward or out of bounds. I was a very polite, safe date.&quot;22
'N Sync
In 1995, Bass joined Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick and Joey Fatone in the boy band 'N Sync, after the original bass singer, Jason Watkins, quit the group.23 In need of a replacement, the group began searching. Timberlake recruited Bass, following a recommendation by their mutual vocal coach, Westbrook.24 Timberlake later said that the group had to convince Bass's mother to let her son join, as they were told she would &quot;never let him do it&quot;.25 'N Sync toured Germany throughout 1996, before hitting it big in the United States two years later. In 2000, the group released the fastest-selling record of all time, No Strings Attached,26 and in 2001 followed it up with their Celebrity album,27 which scored the second highest first-week album sales ever.28 Bass was known as &quot;The Shy One&quot;.29
Bass has said that he felt betrayed when 'N Sync went through much-publicized legal battles with Lou Pearlman in 1999. Of Pearlman, who has since been imprisoned for various bank fraud charges, Bass has said, &quot;I had thought of Lou as a member of the family, but I felt that I'd been completely screwed over... I had learned a cruel lesson. I knew I would never be able to completely rely on anyone in this business again, no matter how nice they seemed.&quot;30 In a November 2007 interview with GQ magazine, Bass revealed that the last time he ever spoke to Pearlman was &quot;in court. Karma is a bitch.&quot;31
Film, television and theater

In 2000, Bass had a recurring role as the character Rick Palmer on the WB drama 7th Heaven.32 Bass received his first starring role in the 2001 motion picture On The Line, co-starring Emmanuelle Chriqui and fellow 'N Sync bandmember Joey Fatone. The film was produced by Bass's production company, Bacon &amp; Eggs (formerly known as A Happy Place), and featured appearances by Jerry Stiller, Al Green, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, former WWE wrestler Joanie Laurer, and Bass's bandmates Justin Timberlake and Chris Kirkpatrick (who were seen only in the end credits). Production on the film took place in Toronto and Chicago over the span of one month, as 'N Sync was in the midst of recording their Celebrity album at the time.33 Miramax marketed the film heavily towards 'N Sync's teen fans, and the film's soundtrack featured songs by teen pop sensations Mandy Moore and BB Mak, along with previously unreleased tracks by 'N Sync and Britney Spears. However, the film was a box-office flop, and grossed only $4.2 million domestically despite having a production budget of $10 million.34 Bass's acting abilities took the brunt of the film's criticisms, with one movie critic calling Bass &quot;a pitiful actor [who] should never be put in a position where he will be expected to emote.&quot;35 New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick also stated that Bass's acting &quot;makes Freddie Prinze Jr. look like Al Pacino.&quot;36
Despite criticisms received after On The Line, Bass has gone on to make several other film appearances, with cameos in both Zoolander and Wes Craven's Cursed. In the 2007 film I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, Bass played a wedding singer.37 Bass has also lent his voice to several animated television programs, such as Robot Chicken and Disney's Kim Possible and Higglytown Heroes.38 In the gaming world, Bass was the voice of Sephiroth in the successful action role-playing game, Kingdom Hearts.39 He did not reprise his role in the sequel, Kingdom Hearts 2.
On August 14, 2007, Bass began a six-month stint as Corny Collins in the Broadway musical Hairspray, coinciding with the play's five year stage anniversary.40 Of making his Broadway debut, Bass said, &quot;I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve always wanted to do Broadway. I think every entertainer&lt;U+2019&gt;s dream is to eventually do some kind of theater in New York.&quot;41
Producing career
Bass's film production company, Bacon &amp; Eggs, went on to produce the 2004 short film Seek &amp; Hide.42 In 2007, Bacon &amp; Eggs produced the film Lovewrecked, which starred Amanda Bynes, Chris Carmack and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, and had Bass in a small role.43 Bass also formed a separate production company named Lance Bass Productions.44
In addition to film production, Bass has also dabbled in music management. In 2000, he formed a management company for country artists called Free Lance Entertainment, which was a joint venture with Mercury Nashville, a division of Mercury Records.45 However, the only album released through Free Lance was Reach by Meredith Edwards, which debuted to low numbers on the Billboard charts.46 The company is now defunct.47
On May 14, 2007, Brian Graden announced that Bass will be working with the LOGO network in executive producing a reality project about the music business.48
Autobiography
Bass's autobiography, &quot;Out Of Sync&quot;, was published on October 23, 2007.49 It was co-written by New York Times best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster.5051 The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as &quot;the first chapter&quot; in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his sexuality.52 Bass does not hold back his true feelings about 'N Sync's 2004 decision to go on &quot;permanent hiatus&quot;, expressing anger and confusion when bandmate Timberlake left the band to pursue a solo career.53
Spaceflight plans
 In August 2002, Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia. Bass was originally supposed to be the host of a space competition show to be entitled &quot;The Big Mission&quot;, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian Soyuz space capsule. However, the game show concept fell apart when the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. The producers came up with the idea of using Bass when, while sitting with a friend and discussing the space project, the friend's daughter shouted out, &quot;Lance Bass wants to go into space!&quot; The girl, who was an 'N Sync fan, learned of Bass's lifelong dream of space travel when she read it in an online chat, and suggested Bass to the producers.54
 Of the opportunity to go to space, Bass said, &quot;I am completely overwhelmed at the invitation. I'm looking forward to completing this lifelong dream. I am honored and privileged to represent my country in this history-making mission.&quot;55 Before being cleared for training, Bass had to participate in weeks of medical screening at the Institute for Bio-Medical Problems near Moscow, Russia.56 In order to be admitted into training, Bass agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct cardiac arrythmia, which was discovered in 1999 when he collapsed after a concert.57 Bass's training included parabolic flights, space flight theory, learning how to eat and drink in space, underwater training, and intense physical training, including daily four mile runs.58 The training also included &quot;survival training&quot; for different climactic and geographical areas, in case there were complications with his shuttle landing; it was reported that Bass had to &quot;learn shooting techniques to defend himself against wolves and other predators, in addition to basic preservation skills such as building a shelter and starting a fire.&quot;59 In order to communicate with his fellow cosmonauts, Bass had to learn the Russian language from a tutor who spoke only French.60
After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and was scheduled to fly into space on the Soyuz TMA-1 mission that was to be launched on October 30, 2002. The capsule was scheduled to fly to the International Space Station, and land in a desert in Kazakhstan.61 When Bass's original deal with the major network that was set to air his documentary fell through, Bass's camp turned to MTV, who briefly agreed to sponsor the trip, but then backed out over &quot;payment, insurance, and indemnification issues&quot;.62 Shortly after, all of Bass's other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor that pulled out because they worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission.63 Bass was eventually kicked out of the program, and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Lonchakov, along with an empty container, ended up taking his place.64 The capsule successfully landed on May 4, 2003, Bass's 24th birthday.
Bass's failed space attempt landed him on People magazine's list of &quot;2002's Losers&quot;, coming in fourth place behind Michael Jackson, George Michael, and Senator Trent Lott.65 On September 26, 2002, rumors began to surface that Bass was &quot;depressed and suicidal&quot; after his attempts at space travel had failed.66 Bass's camp denied reports, with one Jive Records executive saying, &quot;Lance is a very happy person and I'm sure he's got more in his life than this trip, so I'd be very surprised if he got that upset about it all.&quot;67 In his 2007 autobiography, Bass wrote that his failure to make it onto the Soyuz mission was &quot;extremely embarrassing&quot; and left him in a state of emotional exhaustion. &quot;I had lost thirty pounds during this ordeal. Even the green in my eyes had faded... I was hurt really bad.&quot;68
In October 2004, during World Space Week, Bass was formally inducted as a member of the National Space Society's Board of Governors. Serving in an advisory and public outreach capacity, Bass has joined astronauts and prominent individuals who have made a lasting, positive impact on human space exploration, including actor Tom Hanks, journalist Hugh Downs and author and futurist Sir Arthur C. Clarke, among many others.69
Coming out
 Bass revealed that he was gay in a front page cover story for People magazine70 on July 26, 2006. There had been considerable speculation about his sexuality due to numerous paparazzi snapshots of him at gay bars and nightclubs, most notably during the preceding July 4th weekend in Provincetown, Massachusetts.71
Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton had consistently posted items on his website about Bass's sexuality beginning in September 2005.72 However, Bass and his friends have claimed that it was not Hilton who outed him, but instead a blurb that ran in the Page Six gossip column on July 12, 2006.73 Bass's mother read the blurb, and immediately went on the Internet to discover various gossip sites reporting on her son's sexuality. &quot;The worst part about it was my mom found out not from me,&quot; said Bass. &quot;She found out on the Internet, and that's what just killed me. ... It destroyed her for a little bit.&quot;74 Of his decision to come out, Bass said, &quot;The thing is, I&lt;U+2019&gt;m not ashamed &lt;U+2013&gt; that&lt;U+2019&gt;s the one thing I want to say. I don't think it's wrong, I'm not devastated going through this. I'm more liberated and happy than I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been my whole life. I'm just happy.&quot;75
Bass, who knew that he was gay since age five,7677 has said that the image of 'N Sync was one of the main reasons for keeping his sexuality hidden. In his coming out interview, Bass stated, &quot;I knew that I was in this popular band and I had four other guys' careers in my hand, and I knew that if I ever acted on it, or even said [that I was gay], it would overpower everything.&quot;78 Bass has stated that, while there were many rules the members of 'N Sync had to follow in order to uphold their public image &lt;U+2013&gt; such as not being seen smoking or drinking &lt;U+2013&gt; he was never told, &quot;And you can't be gay&quot;.79 Yet Bass said he knew that coming out would hurt the band's sales. &quot;If you can't have a beer in your hand &lt;U+2013&gt; if that's going to make thousands of girls not buy your album &lt;U+2013&gt; then being gay definitely is going to make girls not buy your album.&quot;80 Despite these fears, Bass revealed in an August 2007 interview with The New York Daily News that his female fanbase &quot;exploded&quot; when he came out.81 On July 26, 2007, Bass celebrated the one year anniversary of his coming out with a letter to his fans on his MySpace page, in which he stated that coming out was &quot;the best thing I have ever done.&quot;82
Public response
Bass's announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving &quot;overwhelming support&quot; from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync.83 Bass's announcement quickly found its way into popular culture when the term &quot;lanced&quot;, which means &quot;to be outed by someone in the public media&quot;, began to be used after his decision to come out. In recent months, this term was applied to actors T.R. Knight and Neil Patrick Harris after they faced similar media scrutiny regarding their sexualities. The catchphrase was coined by Bass's ex-boyfriend, Reichen Lehmkuhl.84
Bass received heat from the gay community when certain statements that he made in his People interview offended some activists. In the interview, Bass referred to himself and his friends as straight acting. &quot;I call them the SAGs &lt;U+2014&gt; the straight-acting gays,&quot; Bass said. &quot;We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer.&quot;85 This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes.8687 Bass, according to gay groups, also seemed to imply that he had little interest in the fight for equal rights, after Bass commented that he was not planning on &quot;leading the parade&quot;.8889 In a 2007 interview with the Southern Voice, Bass said these statements were misunderstood. &lt;U+201C&gt;I am very new to this, so I would be stupid to lead the parades and talk at these events, because I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t know what I'm talking about. I don&lt;U+2019&gt;t know the phrases to say, and everything that I say is going to be taken wrong... I'll definitely get involved, but I'm not going to pretend I'm the smartest person out there [or say], &lt;U+2018&gt;Listen to me because I know what I'm saying.&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt;90 When asked by the Dallas Observer if he stood by his description of himself as a &quot;straight-acting gay&quot;, Bass replied, &quot;No... I was trying to say that there are so many types of gay people, just like there are so many types of straight people. And that just didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t read well. I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t explain it well.&quot;91
On October 6, 2006, the Human Rights Campaign awarded Bass its 2006 Visibility Award.92 The decision was met with heavy criticism from certain HRC sponsors, who claimed that Bass had not done enough to deserve the award.93 One journalist at The Washington Blade threatened to walk out when Bass received the award, &quot;in a quiet form of protest&quot;.94 The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, &quot;Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today.&quot;95
Image and personal life
Bass has mentioned in several interviews that he is a practicing Christian and that he regularly attends church.9697 During his days in 'N Sync, Bass's album liner notes often included extended writings on his faith, God, and Jesus Christ,98 and he was known for wearing a large cross necklace around his neck at many public events.99 In a 2001 interview with Larry King, Bass proclaimed, &quot;I'm very religious&quot;100 and expressed with certainty that God is &quot;definitely, definitely&quot; watching over him.101 Regarding obstacles he has faced for being a gay Christian, Bass has said that his sexuality has not affected his faith. &quot;I'm still a Christian. I was not raised in a Christian church to hate people. I was taught to love people and accept people.&quot;102 Bass also stated that he was able to dodge many questions about his sexuality during the height of 'N Sync's popularity because of his image as a &quot;good Christian boy&quot;.103 In his 2007 autobiography, Bass writes that, after revealing his sexuality to his mother, she asked him, &quot;If you died today, would you go to Heaven?&quot; Bass responded, &quot;Yes, Mother. I would.&quot;104
In June 2004, paparazzi pictures emerged of a swollen-looking Bass with two black eyes and a significantly smaller looking nose.105 This led to media speculation that he had had rhinoplastic surgery.106 However, when asked, Bass's representatives refused to confirm or deny the rumors.107
Regarding his desire to one day start a family, Bass has stated that he would like to have his own biological children as well as adopt other children.108 He is the godfather of bandmate Joey Fatone's daughter, Briahna.109
Statement about past marriage
In an October 2007 interview, Bass stated that he married a former girlfriend in Las Vegas, Nevada in &quot;1999 or 2000&quot;.110 Of the quickie wedding, he said, &quot;The only reason we did it is because we wanted to get free drinks all night.&quot;111 However, a marriage license search done the following day in Clark County, Nevada came up empty, with no record of Bass's marriage existing.112 Bass's publicist, Ken Sunshine, later issued a statement that Bass was joking and that a legal wedding never took place.113 &quot;By saying he was married in Vegas, it was a way to get free drinks,&quot; Sunshine said. &quot;He never really got married. That's why there's no record of it.&quot;114
Relationships
During his time in 'N Sync, Bass was in a relationship with actress Danielle Fishel of TV's Boy Meets World, whose high school (Calabasas High School) prom he attended.115 Fishel has said that she was not aware that Bass was gay during their relationship.116 On the October 23, 2007 episode of The Tyra Banks Show, Bass and Fishel said that their relationship was non-sexual.117 Bass later said, &quot;I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t want to do anything, because I knew I&lt;U+2019&gt;d come out of the closet eventually, and I was thinking ahead, and didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t want her to say, &lt;U+2018&gt;I lost my virginity to a gay guy.'&quot;118
Bass has stated that the first time he had ever been in love was during his long-term relationship with Jesse Tannenbaum, now a modeling agent, which Bass documents in his autobiography.119 The two men met in Orlando, Florida; at the time, Tannenbaum was a senior at the University of Central Florida and Bass was preparing to leave for cosmonaut training in Russia. The couple established a relationship that continued over several years, in which they lived together in Bass's estate in Orlando and eventually moved into a Los Angeles home together until late 2004.120
In early 2006, Bass entered a relationship with Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl, which quickly became high-profile after Bass came out in July of that year. The couple split in January 2007, amidst rumors of Lehmkuhl's infidelity.121 Of the split, Bass has said, &quot;It was embarrassing... I was madly in love. I was so happy. People would talk so much shit about him. I thought, Why does everyone hate him? At the end I'm like, 'Okay, everyone was right.'&quot;122 After his breakup with Lehmkuhl, Bass briefly dated a Brazilian fashion model named Pedro Andrade.123 In October 2007, Bass responded to a question about what he looks for in a partner by saying, &quot;I like a good heart, same kind of morals as I do, and someone who definitely wants a family one day.&quot;124
Philanthropy
In 2003, Bass donated $30,000 to establish the Amber Pulliam Special Education Endowment at The University of Southern Mississippi. The endowment is in honor of his younger cousin, Amber Pulliam, who has Down's Syndrome, and was established to financially aid students from Mississippi's Pine Belt who plan a career in special education.125
On October 16, 2005, Bass appeared on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition where he wrote a check for $50,000 and presented it to a Russian woman with Cerebral Palsy who started a camp for disabled Russian children.126
