Re-recordings
Every track, except for &quot;Under the Knife&quot;, has been re-recorded and included on another Hatebreed album, providing better versions of songs which suffered from sub-par production quality.
&quot;Not One Truth&quot; and &quot;Puritan&quot; were included on Hatebreed's 1997 full-length Satisfaction Is the Death of Desire.
&quot;Smash Your Enemies&quot; was re-recorded for the 2002 release Perseverance.
In 2005, &quot;Severed&quot; was re-recorded and added as a bonus track for the UK release of Supremacy.
&quot;Kill an Addict&quot; and &quot;Filth&quot; were iTunes exclusive tracks for the special edition of Hatebreed's self-titled album in 2009. This special edition is no longer available on iTunes.
