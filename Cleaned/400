Graham Windeatt (born August 5 1954) was an Australian long-distance freestyle swimmer of the 1970s, who won a silver medal in the 1500 m freestyle at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Windeatt made his debut at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he claimed gold in the 1500 m. In Munich, he was involved in an epic battle with the reigning 1500 m Olympic champion from 1968, the United States' Mike Burton. After leading for 600 m, Burton was passed by Windeatt, before reclaiming the lead in the last 300 m. Later in the Olympics, Windeatt came fourth in the 400 m freestyle, which was notable for the victory of teammate Brad Cooper after the controversial disqualification of American Rick deMont. Windeatt also placed seventh in the 400 m individual medley and fifth in the 4x200 m freestyle relay. Windeatt was also selected for the 1976 Montreal Olympics, but he disappointed along with the rest of the team, being eliminated in the heats of the 200 m, 400 m and 4x200 m freestyle events.
