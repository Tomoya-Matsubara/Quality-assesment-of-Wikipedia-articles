HNoMS Mjlner was the fourth of five ships of the sclass John Ericsson monitor 0 monitor warship monitors built for the Royal Swedish Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy in the mid-1860s.  Impressed by the use of ironclads during the American Civil War, the design was based on that of the USS Monitor. They were designed under the supervision of the Swedish-born inventor, John Ericssoncoincidentally, designer of the Monitor, and built in Sweden. Mjlner was delivered in 1868 and ran aground the following year, although she was not seriously damaged. The ship was reconstructed in 1897 and given modern Breech-loading weapon breech-loading guns. Mjlner was sold for ship breaking scrap in 1909.
Design and description
The John Ericsson-class ironclads were designed to meet the need of the Swedish and Norwegian Navies for small, shallow-draft armored ships capable of defending their coastal waters. The standoff between the USS Monitor and the much larger ship CSS Virginia  6 during the Battle of Hampton Roads in, early 1862, roused much interest in Sweden in this monitor warship new type of warship, as it seemed ideal for coastal defense duties. John Ericsson, designer and builder of the Monitor, born in Swedenalthough becoming an American citizen in 1848offered to share his design with the Swedes. In response, they sent Lieutenant John Christian d'Ailly to the United States to study monitor design and construction under Ericsson. D'Ailly arrived in July 1862 and toured Rolling metalworking rolling mills, Foundry gun foundries, and visited several different ironclads under construction. He returned to Sweden in 1863 having completed the drawings of a Monitor-type ship under Ericsson's supervision.Harris 1994, pp. 2224
The ship measured convert 60.88 m ftin sp=us length overall long overall, with a beam nautical beam of convert 13.54 m ftin sp=us. She had a draft ship draft of convert 3.4 m ftin sp=us and displaced convert 1522 t LT lk=on sp=us. Mjlner was divided into nine main compartments by eight watertight bulkhead partition bulkheads. Over time a flying bridge and, later, a full superstructure, was added to each ship between the gun turret and the funnel.Bjoerud, p. 169 Initially her crew numbered 80 officers and men, but this increased to 104 as she was modified with additional weapons.Harris 1994, p. 26
Propulsion
The John Ericsson-class ships had one twin-cylinder Marine_steam_engine#Vibrating_lever vibrating lever steam engines, designed by Ericsson himself, driving a single four-bladed, convert 3.74 m ftin sp=us adj=on propeller. Their engines were powered by four fire-tube boilers at a working pressure of convert 40 psi kPa kg/cm2 0 abbr=on lk=on. The engines produced a total of convert 380 ihp lk=on which gave the monitors a maximum speed of convert 6.5 kn lk=on in calm waters. The ships carried convert 110 t LT  of coal, enough for six day's steaming.Harris 1994, pp. 2627
Armament
Mjlner was armed with a pair of Armstrong Whitworth Armstrong convert 270 mm in sp=us 1 adj=on Muzzle-loading rifle rifled muzzle-loading guns. Each gun was constructed of steel and weighed convert 18.5 LT t. The ship also carried a convert 80 mm sp=us adj=on gun. During Mjlner's reconstruction in 1897 her gun turret was fixed in place and modified to serve as a barbette for her two new Breech-loading weapon breech-loading John Cockerill company Cockerill convert 120 mm adj=on 0 sp=us guns. She also received two convert 124 mm sp=us adj=on and convert 65 mm sp=us adj=on Cockerill guns mounted in her superstructure. In addition two convert 37 mm in adj=on sp=us Hotchkiss gun Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns were mounted in the superstructure.Harris 1994, pp. 27, 34 They fired a shell weighing about convert 1.1 lb kg abbr=on at a muzzle velocity of about convert 2000 ft/s m/s abbr=on. This gave them a range of about convert 3500 yd m. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minutecite web url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm title=United States of America 1-pdr 0.45 kg 1.46 37 mm Marks 1 through 15 date=15 August 2008 accessdate=22 August 2010 publisher=Navweps.com
Armor
The John Ericsson-class ships had a complete waterline armor Belt armor belt of wrought iron that was convert 1.8 m ftin sp=us high and convert 124 mm in 1 sp=us thick. The armor consisted of five plates backed by convert 91 mm in 1 sp=us of wood. The lower edge of this belt was convert 74.2 mm in 1 sp=us thick as it was only three plates thick. The maximum thickness of the armored deck was convert 24.7 mm in 1 sp=us in two layers. The gun turret's armor consisted of twelve layers of iron, totalling convert 270 mm in 1 sp=us in thickness on the first four monitors. The inside of the turret was lined with mattresses to catch splinters. The base of the turret was protected with a convert 127 mm in adj=on sp=us glacis, convert 520 mm in 1 sp=us high, and the turret's roof was 127&nbsp;millimeters thick.  The conning tower was positioned on top of the turret and its sides were ten layers convert 250 mm in 1 sp=us thick. The funnel was protected by six layers of armor with a total thickness of convert 120 mm in 1 sp=us up to half its height.
Service
The Norwegians had built one monitor-type ship of their own, ship HNoMS Skorpionen  2, in 1865, and laid down several others, but the Norwegian Parliament authorized construction of Mjlner in 1867 in Sweden at the cost of 1,102,000 Norwegian krone.The exact relationship between the Norwegian sclass Skorpionen monitors and the John Ericsson class is unclear. Harris 1994 says that the Skorpionen class merely had five, instead of four, boilers and were otherwise identical, see p. 34. But Gardiner cites slightly different dimensions and counts Mjlner as part of the class, see p. 368, as does Silverstone, p. 350 She was launched in 1868 and completed on 7 September of that year.Harris 1994, p. 27 The ship ran aground at Krager on 21 June 1869. Mjlner could not be pulled off the rocks until the ship's ammunition, iron Sailing ballast ballast and convert 120 LT t of coal were removed. Her repairs were completed on 7 July 1869 by the Royal Dockyard at Horten, at the cost of 5,000 krone. The Naval Board of Inquiry court of inquiry found the ship's commander and the Maritime pilot pilot liable for the repairs, but the parliament released the two from their obligation two years later.Harris 1995, p. 172 She was visited by King Charles XV of Sweden on one occasion when visiting one of Sweden's west-coast ports in the early 1870s. Mjlner was Wikt:mothball laid up after her refit in 1897, but was mobilized during 1905 when the personal union between Union between Sweden and Norway Sweden and Norway was dissolved. She returned to reserve afterward before being sold for scrap in 1909.
