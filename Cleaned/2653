Prehistory comprises all events which took place before the creation of written records. This page lists events from the evolution of the universe and the Earth to the origin of life and human evolution, up to the invention of writing in approximately 4,000 BC. Note that many of these dates are speculative or very rough estimates. For a timeline of historical events see: Timeline of world history. For greater detail see the articles on the various geological periods.
Human prehistory
Timeline from the evolution of modern humans to the invention of writing. All dates are approximate and conjectural, obtained through research in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, genetics, geology, or linguistics. They are all subject to revision due to new discoveries or improved calculations.
