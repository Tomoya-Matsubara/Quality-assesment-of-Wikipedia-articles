German submarine U-853 was a Nazi Germany German German Type IX submarine#Type IXC/40 Type IXC/40 U-boat of the Kriegsmarine during World War II. Her keel was laid down on 21 August 1942 by AG Weser of Bremen. She was ship commissioning commissioned on 25 June 1943 with Kapitnleutnant Helmut Sommer in command. U-853 saw action during the Battle of the Atlantic 19391945 Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. She conducted three patrols, sinking two ships totalling 5,783 tons. 
On her final patrol, U-853 was sent to harass United States coastal shipping.  She destroyed USS Eagle Boat 56 PE-56 USS Eagle 56 PE-56 near Portland, Maine Portland, Maine.  Just days before Germany's surrender, U-853 torpedoed and sank the collier Black Point during the #Battle of Point Judith Battle of Point Judith.  American warships quickly found U-853 and sank her convert 7 mi east of Block Island, Rhode Island, resulting in the loss of her entire crew.
U-853 is a popular deep sea diving site.  She rests in convert 121 ft of water.  Holes in the hull permit access to the interior of the submarine, though it is a war grave with most of the 55 crew bodies remaining inside.   
 Construction and crew
U-853 was a German Type IXC/40 submarine built by AG Weser of Bremen. Ordered on 5 June 1941, her keel was laid on 21 August 1942 and she was commissioned on 25 June 1943.cite web publisher=www.uboat.net title=U-853 url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/u853.htm accessdate=2007-09-30 She was one of 87 submarines of her type.  The Type IXC/40 was a large ocean-going submarine that designed for sustained operations far from the home support facilities. U-853 carried a crew of 55. The Germans nicknamed the U-boat der Seiltnzer the Tightrope Walker, and her crew painted an emblem of a yellow shield with a red horse on her sail.cite book title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56 last=Puleo first=Stephen publisher=Globe Pequot isbn=1592287395 year=2005 pages=1517
First patrol
On her first patrol from May to June 1944, U-853 was assigned to weather-watching duty under the command of Kapitnleutnant Helmut Sommer.  This was his first war patrol.cite web publisher=www.uboat.net title=Helmut Sommer url=http://www.uboat.net/men/commanders/1203.html accessdate=2007-09-30 German intelligence believed that weather conditions in the Atlantic could be used to help predict the timing of an Allied invasion of Europe.cite book title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56 last=Puleo first=Stephen publisher=Globe Pequot isbn=1592287395 year=2005 page=16 On May 25, 1944 U-853 spotted the RMS Queen Mary Queen Mary, loaded with American troops and supplies.  The U-boat submerged to attack, but was outrun by the much larger and faster ship.cite book title=The Greatest Submarine Stories Ever Told last=Underwood first=Lamar year=2005 publisher=Globe Pequot isbn=1592287336 pages=184185  As she surfaced in the Queen Mary's wake U-853 was attacked by Fairey Swordfish aircraft from British merchant aircraft carriers ship MV Ancylus and ship MV Empire MacKendrick.cite book title=The Barque of Saviors  last=Drumm first=Russell year=2001 publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books isbn=0395983673 page=9 The U-boat took no significant damage and returned fire, hitting all three aircraft.  The planes were able to return to their carrier, but after recovery one was deemed a total loss and jettisoned.
The escort carrier USS Croatan CVE-14 had been hunting weather boats for nearly a month and had already sunk GS U-488  2 and GS U-490  2.  Intercepted radio transmissions led Croatan and six destroyers to search for U-853.cite book title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56 last=Puleo first=Stephen publisher=Globe Pequot isbn=1592287395 year=2005 page=17 The U-853 proved so elusive that Croatans crew nicknamed their prey Moby Dick. After ten days of hunting, on June 17 Huff-Duff HF/DF, high frequency direction finding picked up a weather report from the U-853 only convert 30 mi away.  Within minutes two FM-1 Wildcat fighters strafed the submarine, killing  2 men and wounding 12 others.  Sommer suffered 28 shrapnel and bullet wounds yet still managed to give the order to submerge.  In all likelihood Sommer saved his submarine from being destroyed by allied bombers.
Three weeks of pursuit from May 25 until June 17 placed an enormous strain on U-853's crew. Twenty-three year old Oberleutnant zur See Helmut Frmsdorf took command of the boat on June 18 his first commandcite web publisher=www.uboat.net title=Helmut Frmsdorf url=http://www.uboat.net/men/commanders/332.html accessdate=2007-09-30 and returned to Lorient. Sommer and a large number of the crew was declared unfit for duty. On July 10 Sommer was formally relieved by Oberlutenant Otto Wermuth.
Second patrol
The boat remained in port until August 27. Decorated veteran Korvettenkapitn Gnter Kuhnke, Commander of the 10. Unterseebootsflottille 10th Flotilla, took command for her second patrol.cite web publisher=www.uboat.net title=Gnter Kuhnke url=http://www.uboat.net/men/kuhnke.htm accessdate=2007-09-30  
U-853 operated this time in the Western Approaches off the British Isles, but in a period of seven weeks scored no successes. On completion she did not return to Lorient, but continued to Flensburg, arriving October 14.

Kuhnke assumed command of the 33. Unterseebootsflottille 33rd Flotilla upon arriving at Flensburg.  He relinquished command of U-853 back to Frmsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure U-853 was fitted with a Submarine snorkel Schnorchel, a retractable air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The Schnorchel reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.
Last patrol
On February 23, 1945 Germany sent U-853 on her third war patrol to harass US coastal shipping.  Under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Helmut Frmsdorf, U-853 did not sink any targets during the first weeks of her patrol.  Her crossing of the Atlantic was slow because she used her Schnorchel to remain submerged to avoid being spotted by Allied aircraft.   On April 1, 1945 U-853 was ordered to the Gulf of Maine.cite web publisher=www.nedivenews.com url=http://www.nedivenews.com/?q=node/32/print author=Peter Venoutsos title=U-853 Closes a Chapter of World War II accessdate=2008-09-30  On April 23 she fatally torpedoed USS Eagle Boat 56 PE-56 USS Eagle Boat 56 PE-56 near Portland, Maine.cite web title=U-853 publisher=www.uscg.mil accessdate=2008-09-29 url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/U853.asp The next day USS Muskegon PF-24 USS Muskegon PF-24 made sonar contact and attacked U-853, but failed to destroy her.
Eagle Boat 56, a World War I-era patrol boat, was towing targets for a United States Navy dive-bomber training exercise convert 3 mi off Cape Elizabeth, Maine Cape Elizabeth when she exploded amidships and sank.  Only 13 of the 67 crew survived.  Although several survivors claimed to have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion.  The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 to acknowledge that the sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.cite book title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56 last=Puleo first=Stephen publisher=Globe Pequot isbn=1592287395 year=2005 page=5

On May 5, 1945, President of Germany President Reichsprsident of Nazi Germany Karl Dnitz ordered all U-boats to cease offensive operations and return to their bases. U-853 was lying in wait off Point Judith, Rhode Island at the time.  According to the US Coast Guard, U-853 did not receive that order, or less likely, ignored it.  Soon after, her torpedo blew off the stern of SS Black Point, a convert 368 ft adj=on Collier ship type collier underway from New York City, New York New York to Boston, Massachusetts Boston. Within 15 minutes Black Point had sunk in convert 100 ft of water less than convert 4 mi south of Point Judith.cite web publisher=www.nedivenews.com url=http://www.nedivenews.com/?q=node/180 title=U-853 accessdate=2008-09-30  She was the last US-flagged merchant ship lost in World War II. Twelve men died, while 34 crew members were rescued. One of the rescuing ships, Yugoslav freighter SS Kamen, sent a report of the torpedoing to authorities.  The United States Navy US Navy organized a hunter-killer group that included four American warships: USS Ericsson DD-440 3, USS Amick DE-168 3, USS Atherton  DE-169 3, and USS Moberly PF-63 3.cite web title=U-853 url=http://www.uscg.mil/History/WEBCUTTERS/PF63_Moberly.html publisher=uscg.mil accessdate=2007-07-23 Dead link date=September 2010 bot=H3llBot
The group discovered U-853 bottomed in convert 18 fathom, and dropped depth charges and hedgehog weapon hedgehogs during a 16 hour attack.  At first the U-boat attempted to flee, and then tried to hide by lying still.  Both times it was found by sonar.cite book   title=Block Island&mdash;The Sea   author=Robert M. Downie   publisher= Book Nook Press   year= 1998 pages=197198 The morning of May 6, 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers.  K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from Atherton and Moberly resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface.  With the loss of all 55 officers and men, U-853 was one of the last U-boat sunk during World War II. and, with German submarine U-881 U-881, the last to be sunk in US waters. Atherton and Moberly received credit for the kill.
 Wreck 
U-853 lies seven miles east of Block Island in convert 130 ft of water. The US Coast Guard pinpoints the location of the wreck at 41.13 N 71.27 W. U-853 sits upright with her periscope rising to a depth of convert 100 ft. Most of the 55 crew member bodies remain within the hull, which is a war grave.cite web url=http://www.uboat.net/fates/dive/dive_us.htm title=Dive into History US Waters publisher=www.uboat.net accessdate=2008-09-30 It is one of the more popular dive sites in Southern New England. The hull has depth charge blast holes: one forward of the conning tower at the radio room and another in the starboard side of the engine room. Entering the wreck is dangerous due to debris, sharp metal edges, and confined spaces.  
On May 6 and 7, 1945, Navy divers attempted to enter the wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed.  Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953.  In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck.  This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage.cite book   title=Block Island&mdash;The Sea   author=Robert M.
