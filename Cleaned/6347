The Hakon Jarl Runestones are Swedish runestones from the time of Canute the Great.
Two of the runestones, one in Uppland (U 617) and one in Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land (Sm 76) mention a Hakon Jarl,1 and both runologists and historians have debated whether they are one and the same, or two different men.2 Moreover, all known Hakon Jarls have been involved in the debate: H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Sigur&lt;U+00F0&gt;arson (d. 995), his grandson H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Eir&lt;U+00ED&gt;ksson (d. 1029), H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon &lt;U+00CD&gt;varsson (d. 1062) and H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon P&lt;U+00E1&gt;lsson (d. 1122).3 The most common view among runologists (Brate, von Friesen, Wess&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, Jansson, Kinander and Ruprecht) is that the two stones refer to different Hakon Jarls and that one of them was Swedish and the other one Norwegian.4

 This runestone was located in Nibble on the island of Eker&lt;U+00F6&gt;, but it has disappeared. In scholarly literature it was first described by Johannes Bureus (1568 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1652), and it was depicted by Leitz in 1678. Johan Hadorph noted in 1680 that the name of the deceased in the inscription had been bitten off by locals who believed that doing so would help against tooth ache. Elias Wess&lt;U+00E9&gt;n notes that ro&lt;U+00F0&gt;i HakonaR refers to a leidang organization under a man named H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon who could have been a jarl, but he considers it most likely that H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon refers to the Swedish king H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon the Red.5 Others identify H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon with the Norwegian jarl H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Eir&lt;U+00ED&gt;ksson, like Sm 76, below,6 and Omeljan Pritsak considers the man to whom the stone was dedicated to have been a member of the army of jarl H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Eir&lt;U+00ED&gt;ksson in England.7

U 617
This runestone is also called the Bro Runestone after the church by which it is located. It is raised by the same aristocratic family as the Ramsund carving and the Kjula Runestone, which allows scholars to study the family of the Hakon Jarl who is mentioned on this runestone.9 He is considered to have been Swedish and his son &lt;U+00D6&gt;zurr may have been responsible for organizing the local defense organization against raiders on the shores of lake M&lt;U+00E4&gt;laren.10 However, the only recorded organization of such a defence is from England and consequently both this Hakon Jarl and his son &lt;U+00D6&gt;zurr may have been active in England in the &lt;U+00DE&gt;ingali&lt;U+00F0&gt; instead.11 Omeljan Pritsak argues that this Hakon is the same as the one who is mentioned on the S&lt;U+00F6&gt;dra Betby Runestone and whose son Ulf was in the west, i.e. in England.12 This Swedish Hakon Jarl would then actually be the Norwegian H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Eir&lt;U+00ED&gt;ksson.13
Like the Norwegian jarl H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Eir&lt;U+00ED&gt;ksson, this Swedish Hakon Jarl has been identified with the Varangian chieftain Jakun who is mentioned in the Primary Chronicle.14

He was the viking watch with Geitir(?). May God now help his spirit and soul.&quot;15
==Sm 76==  Only a fragment remains of this runestone, but before it was destroyed, the text had been read by runologists. The fragment is located in the garden of the inn of Komstad in Sm&lt;U+00E5&gt;land. It was originally raised by a lady in memory of Vr&lt;U+00E1&gt;i who had been the marshall of an earl Hakon, who was probably the earl H&lt;U+00E5&gt;kon Eiriksson.1617 Some time earlier, Vr&lt;U+00E1&gt;i had raised the S&lt;U+00E4&gt;vsj&lt;U+00F6&gt; Runestone in memory of his brother Gunni who died in England.18
The generally accepted identification with H&lt;U+00E1&gt;kon Eir&lt;U+00ED&gt;ksson was made by von Friesen in 1922, and he is also held to appear on U 16, above.19
