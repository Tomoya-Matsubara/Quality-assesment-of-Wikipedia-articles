Ion Mihai Pacepa (; born 28 October 1928 in Bucharest, Romania) is a former three-star general in the Securitate, the secret police of Communist Romania, who defected to the United States in July 1978. He is the highest-ranking defector from the former Eastern Bloc, and has written several books and news articles on the inner workings of the communist intelligence services.
At the time of his defection, General Pacepa simultaneously had the rank of advisor to President Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu, acting chief of his foreign intelligence service and a state secretary of Romania's Ministry of Interior. He defected to the United States after President Jimmy Carter's approval of his request for political asylum.
Subsequently, he worked with the American Central Intelligence Agency in various operations against the former Eastern Bloc. The CIA described his cooperation as &quot;an important and unique contribution to the United States&quot;.1
Activity in the Romanian Intelligence
Ion Mihai Pacepa's father (born in 1893) grew up in Alba Iulia, the capital of the principality of Transylvania, which at that time was part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, where he worked in his own father's small factory producing pots and cutlery for the kitchen. On December 1, 1918, Transylvania was united with Romania, and in 1920 Pacepa's father moved to Bucharest, where he spent all his working life at the Romanian representative of the American car company General Motors.
Ion Mihai Pacepa, studied industrial chemistry at the Politehnica University of Bucharest between 1947 and 1951, but just months before graduation he was drafted by the Securitate,2 and got his engineering degree only four years later.He was assigned to the Directorate of Counter-sabotage of the Securitate.3 In 1955 he was transferred to the Directorate of Foreign Intelligence.4
In 1957, Ion Mihai Pacepa was appointed head of the Romanian intelligence station in Frankfurt/Main, West Germany, where he served two years. In October 1959, Minister of the Interior Alexandru Dr&lt;U+0103&gt;ghici appointed him as head of Romania's brand new industrial espionage department, called S&amp;T from the Romanian stiinta si technologie (science and technology) of Directorate I, being the head of Romanian industrial espionage, which he managed until his defection in 1978.5 He was involved with the establishment of Romania's automobile industry,6 and with the development of its microelectronic, polymer, and antibiotic industries.
Between 1972 and 1978, Ion Mihai Pacepa was also President Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu's adviser for industrial and technological development and the deputy chief of the Romanian foreign intelligence service.
Defection
Pacepa defected during July 1978 by walking into the American Embassy in Bonn while in Germany, where he had been sent by Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu with a message to Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. He was flown secretly to Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C., in a United States military airplane.
In a letter to his daughter, Dana, published in the French newspaper Le Monde in 1980 and broadcast over and over by Radio Free Europe, Gen. Pacepa explained the reason for defecting: &quot;In 1978 I got the order to organize the killing of Noel Bernard, the director of Radio Free Europe&lt;U+2019&gt;s Romanian program who had infuriated Ceausescu with his commentaries. It was late July when I got this order, and when I ultimately had to decide between being a good father and being a political criminal. Knowing you, Dana, I was firmly convinced that you would prefer no father to one who was an assassin.&quot; Noel Bernard died in 1981 of cancer, after being allegedly irradiated by the Securitate.
Gen. Pacepa's defection destroyed the intelligence network of communist Romania, and through the revelations of Ceausescu's activity, it affected the latter's international credibility and respectability. An article published by The American Spectator in 1988 summed up the devastation caused by Gen. Pacepa's &quot;spectacular&quot; defection: &quot;His passage from East to West was a historic event, for so carefully had he prepared, and so thorough was his knowledge of the structure, the methods, the objectives, and the operations of Ceausescu&lt;U+2019&gt;s secret service, that within three years the entire organization had been eliminated. Not a single top official was left, not a single major operation was still running. Ceausescu had a nervous breakdown, and gave orders for Pacepa&lt;U+2019&gt;s assassination. At least two squads of murderers have come to the United States to try to find him, and just recently one of Pacepa&lt;U+2019&gt;s former agents--a man who had performed minor miracles in stealing Western technology in Europe at Rumanian behest--spent several months on the East Coast, trying to track down the general. Happily, they have not found him.&quot; 1
During September 1978, Pacepa received two death sentences from Communist Romania, and Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu decreed a bounty of two million US dollars for his death. Yasser Arafat and Muammar al-Gaddafi set one more million dollars reward each.7 During the 1980s, Romania&lt;U+2019&gt;s political police enlisted Carlos the Jackal to assassinate Pacepa in America in exchange for one million dollars.8 Documents found in the Romanian intelligence archives show that the Securitate had given Carlos a whole arsenal to use in &quot;Operation 363&quot; for assassinating Gen. Pacepa in the U.S. Included were 37 kg. plastic explosive EPP/88, 7 submachine guns, one Walther PP pistol serial # 249460 with 1306 bullets, 8 Stechkin pistols with 1049 bullets, and 5 hand grenades UZRG-M.
Carlos was unable to find Pacepa, but on February 21, 1980, he bombed a part of Radio Free Europe's headquarters in Munich, which was broadcasting news of Pacepa's defection. Five Romanian diplomats in West Germany, who had helped Carlos the Jackal in this operation, were expelled from the country.
On July 7, 1999, Romania&lt;U+2019&gt;s Supreme Court Decision No. 41/1999 canceled Pacepa&lt;U+2019&gt;s death sentences and ordered that his properties, confiscated by Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu's orders, be returned to him. Romania's government refused to comply. In December 2004, the new government of Romania restored Pacepa&lt;U+2019&gt;s rank of general.
Writings and political views
Pacepa is a columnist for the Internet conservative blog site PJ Media. He also occasionally writes articles for The Wall Street Journal and various American conservative publications, such as National Review Online, The Washington Times, the online newspaper FrontPage Magazine and the WorldNet Daily.
Red Horizons
During 1987, Pacepa published a book, Red Horizons: Chronicles of a Communist Spy Chief. A Romanian translation of Red Horizons printed in the U.S. was infiltrated into the Communist Romania, and a Mao-style pocketbook of Red Horizons was illegally printed in Communist Hungary (now a valuable collector item). In 1988 Red Horizons was serialized on Radio Free Europe, arousing &quot;huge interest among Romanians&quot;. According to Radio Romania, &quot;the streets of Romania's towns were empty&quot; during the RFE serialization of Red Horizons. On December 25, 1989, during the last part of the Romanian Revolution, Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu and his wife, Elena, were sentenced to death at the end of a trial where most of the accusations came almost word-for-word out of Red Horizons. (A second edition, published in March 1990, contained the transcript of Ceausescu's trial, which was based on facts presented in Red Horizons.)9
On January 1, 1990, the book began being serialized in the new official Romanian newspaper Adev&lt;U+0103&gt;rul, which on that day replaced the Communist Sc&lt;U+00EE&gt;nteia (The Spark). In its lead, Adev&lt;U+0103&gt;rul explained that the book's serialization by Radio Free Europe had &lt;U+201C&gt;played an incontestable role&lt;U+201D&gt; in overthrowing Ceausescu&quot; according to the text on the back cover of the book&lt;U+2019&gt;s second edition, published during 1990). A couple of years later, HistoryOrb.com, which publishes &quot;Famous Birthdays in History,&quot; dedicated 28 October 1928 to: &quot;Ion Mihai Pacepa, Romanian general.&quot; Red Horizons was subsequently republished in 27 countries, and it was made into a documentary movie by the Hungarian TV.. In 2010, The Washington Post recommended that Red Horizons be included on the list of books that should be read in schools, next to Whittaker Chambers's Witness. In 2011, Red Horizons was re-published as an e-book by Google, and its hard copies were still in book stores in 2012.
During 1993, Pacepa published The Kremlin's Legacy, in which he tried to wean his native country away from its continued dependency on a Communist-style police state. During 1999, he authored the trilogy The Black Book of the Securitate, which has become a bestseller in Romania.10
Alleged assassinations by the KGB
In a 2006 article, Pacepa describes a conversation he had with Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu, who told him about &quot;ten international leaders the Kremlin killed or tried to kill&quot;: L&lt;U+00E1&gt;szl&lt;U+00F3&gt; Rajk and Imre Nagy from Hungary; Lucre&lt;U+0163&gt;iu P&lt;U+0103&gt;tr&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+015F&gt;canu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej from Romania; Rudolf Sl&lt;U+00E1&gt;nsk&lt;U+00FD&gt; and Jan Masaryk from Czechoslovakia; Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran; Palmiro Togliatti from Italy; US President John F. Kennedy; and CCP Chairman Mao Zedong. Pacepa provides some additional details, such as an alleged plot to kill Mao Zedong with the help of Lin Biao organized by the KGB.11
Pacepa said that &quot;among the leaders of Moscow's satellite intelligence services there was unanimous agreement that the KGB had been involved in the assassination of President Kennedy&quot;, and that KGB fingerprints are all over Lee Harvey Oswald and his killer Jack Ruby.1213 Pacepa has since had a book published on the topic, Programmed to Kill: Lee Harvey Oswald, the Soviet KGB, and the Kennedy Assassination, in which he asserts that Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev ordered the assassination of Kennedy and other enemies of the Soviet Union. However, Soviet intelligence defector Bohdan Stashynsky was tried in West Germany for the murder of Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera under this plan. The public revelation of this is said to have caused Khrushchev to shut down the plan completely, but Oswald ignored this and proceeded on his own.
In a review of Pacepa's book published in Human Events, Michael Ledeen, former adviser for terrorism to President Reagan, writes: &quot;A new book from General Ion Mihai Pacepa is cause for celebration, because he is among a tiny handful of people who know a lot about the intelligence services of the Soviet Empire, and because he writes about it with rare lucidity, always with an eye to helping us understand our world. His first book, 'Red Horizons,'is indubitably the most brilliant portrait of a Communist regime I've ever read. 'Programmed to Kill' is equally fascinating. Pacepa painstakingly takes us through the documentary evidence, including invaluable material on Soviet bloc cyphers that throws new light on Oswald's letters to KGB officers in Washington and Mexico City. &lt;U+2026&gt; No novelist could have written a more exciting story, made all the more compelling because of Pacepa's first-hand involvement in the Russians' efforts to hide their Oswald connection.&quot;
In H-Net Reviews, Professor Stan Weeber (McNesse State University) states that &quot;Programmed to Kill is a superb new paradigmatic work on the death of President Kennedy.&quot; The review explains that &quot;when successful, a new paradigm essentially connects the dots of the evidence in an extraordinary way to paint a new picture. Pacepa exceeds all prior expectations in this regard. His appendix entitled 'Connecting the Dots' provides a timeline of Oswald&lt;U+2019&gt;s life, along with Pacepa&lt;U+2019&gt;s parenthetical commentary showing how his book has illuminated the facts of the Kennedy case. This allows the reader to compare what the author has contributed alongside what is already known.&quot; Professor Weeber concluded: &quot; From the most casual reader to the serious student preparing his or her own magnum opus, this book is a &lt;U+201C&gt;must read&lt;U+201D&gt; for everyone interested in the assassination of President Kennedy.&quot;14
According to author Joseph Goulden in The Washington Times, Pacepa's belated account &quot;rests rather flimsily on circumstantial evidence and supposition.&quot;15
Alleged Soviet role in supporting terrorism in the Middle East
In a 2006 article written during the Second Lebanon War, Pacepa says the Soviet Union spread anti-Semitic propaganda across the Middle East to increase hatred for the Jews, and by extension Israel and America. Pacepa writes that Soviet propagandists described America as a &quot;Jewish fiefdom&quot; and spread the idea that Israel planned to make the Islamic Middle East into a &quot;Jewish colony.&quot; Furthermore, he describes Soviet Union's alleged role in propagating and funding terrorist groups in the Middle East.16
Alleged Soviet campaign against the Vatican
Pacepa alleged that the Soviet Union tried to discredit the Papacy. In a 2007 article, he stated: &quot;In my other life, when I was at the center of Moscow's foreign-intelligence wars, I myself was caught up in a deliberate Kremlin effort to smear the Vatican, by portraying Pope Pius XII as a coldhearted Nazi sympathizer.&quot;17
In 2012, Pacepa revealed he was writing a book called Disinformation that gives details of the Seat 12 plot and the Soviet &quot;science&quot; of framing. It is co-authored by Pius XII expert and professor of law at the University of Mississippi, Ronald J. Rychlak. In an interview, Pacepa claimed that the original idea to blacken the Pontiff's reputation came from Joseph Stalin in 1945, who wanted the Church out of the Ukraine. On June 3, 1945, his Radio Moscow proclaimed that Pius XII had been &lt;U+201C&gt;Hitler&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pope.&lt;U+201D&gt; But the insinuation fell flat as it came the day after Pius XII had condemned the &lt;U+201C&gt;satanic spectre of Nazism&lt;U+201D&gt; on Vatican Radio. Moreover, Pius was being lauded for his wartime efforts to protect religious minorities by, among others, President Roosevelt, Winston Churchill (who described him as &lt;U+201C&gt;the greatest man of our time&lt;U+201D&gt;), and Albert Einstein. Stalin&lt;U+2019&gt;s disinformation efforts were rejected by that contemporary generation &lt;U+201C&gt;that had lived through the real history and knew who Pope Pius XII really was,&lt;U+201D&gt; Gen. Pacepa explained. He said the KGB tried again, promoting Rolf Hochhuth's 1963 play The Deputy. As that generation &quot;had not lived through that history and did not know better, [this] time it worked.&lt;U+201D&gt;181920
The whole September 2012 issue of the U.S. magazine Whistleblower was dedicated to Gen. Pacepa's book Disinformation, to be released by WND Books in early 2013. (http://superstore.wnd.com/Whistleblower-Magazine).
Disinformation
In 2013, Lt. Gen. Pacepa published &quot;Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism&quot; co-authored with law professor Ronald Rychlak, a prominent expert in the history of religion. &quot;This remarkable book will change the way you look at intelligence, foreign affairs, the press, and much else besides,&quot; wrote R. James Woolsey, former Director of Central Intelligence. &quot;General Pacepa and his distinguished coauthor, Prof. Ronald Rychlak, ... have not only helped us understand history and many of the current dezinformatsiya operations that we continue to see&lt;U+2014&gt;especially from Russia and countries in the Mid&lt;U+00AC&gt;east&lt;U+2014&gt;but also have given us a good start in learning how to defeat them. In short, they open a world that many of us didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t know existed.&quot;
The book deals with some of the most consequential yet largely unknown disinformation campaigns of our lifetime. Among them: how destroying the reputation of good leaders has been developed into a high art and science; how Pope Pius XII, who personally saved countless Jews from Hitler's Holocaust, was transformed into a Nazi sympathizer; how Christianity and Judaism have been targeted for constant denigration and defamation; how the Soviet bloc disinformation machinery seeded anti-Americanism in the Islamic world and generated today's international terrorism. The book also documents how supposedly respectable institutions like the World Council of Churches have been controlled by Russian intelligence, and how much of the world came to believe that the U.S. government itself masterminded the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Several chapters of the book document how post-Soviet Russia was transformed into the first intelligence dictatorship in history, and how disinformation is now infecting the United States of America.
The book Disinformation was published together with a feature-length documentary film, &quot;Disinformation: The Secret Strategy to Destroy the West,&quot; produced by Emmy-winning filmmaker Stan Moore. The two-disc DVD focuses on several major Soviet/Russian disinformation campaigns that still generate anti-Americanism, ignite anti-Semitism, demonize Christianity and fan the flames of Islamic jihad. This documentary features interviews with James Woolsey and many other experts on disinformation. Among them: Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense; Jed Babbin, deputy undersecretary of defense; Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin, deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence; Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, terrorism expert, director of American Center for Democracy; Nina Khrushcheva, great-granddaughter of Nikita Khrushchev; Vladimir Tismaneanu, director, Center for the University of Maryland's Study of Post-Communist Societies.
In April 2014, this documentary film won the 35th Annual Telly Award, honoring the very best films and video productions.
Iraq &amp; WMD
Ion Mihai Pacepa supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In opposition, large anti-war demonstrations were held in cities across the world. Pacepa contends that these protests were contrived and anti-American, which Russia assisted.21 Pacepa wrote during October 2003 that it was &quot;perfectly obvious to me&quot; that the Russian GRU agency helped Saddam Hussein to destroy, hide, or transfer his chemical weapons prior to the American invasion of Iraq during 2003.22 To this end, he claims that an operation for the removal of chemical weapons (&quot;Operation Sarindar&quot;) was prepared by the Soviet Union for Libya, and that such a plan existed and was implemented in Iraq.23 No evidence of any such 'plot' has been uncovered, and no evidence of any Iraqis WMDs materialized after the invasion. The most reliable survey carried out so far found that half a million Iraqis died violent deaths during the 2003&lt;U+2013&gt;11 occupation, and that the US-led occupation forces were the largest single killer (35 per cent).24 Pacepa is not known to have expressed any regret at the deaths of several hundred thousand civilians in Iraq.
According to revelations made by Lt. Gen. James Clapper to the New York Times (October 29, 2003), spy satellites belonging to the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) photographed military vehicles moving from Iraq to Syria with Russian assistance just before the war in Iraq started. In Gen. Clapper's view, illicit weapons material unquestionably had been moved out of Iraq. At that time, Lt. Gen Clapper was head of NIMA. Now he is the United States Director of National Intelligence.
Subsequently, the Iraq Survey Group did not find any significant holdings of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that were present in the country decades earlier. It issued its findings in the Duelfer report during September 2004.
