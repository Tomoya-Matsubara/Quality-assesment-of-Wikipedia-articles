Up in the Air is a 2009 American comedy-drama film directed by Jason Reitman and co-written by Reitman and Sheldon Turner. It is a film adaptation of the 2001 novel of the same name, written by Walter Kirn. The story is about a corporate downsizer Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) and his travels. The film follows his isolated life and philosophies along with the people he meets along the way. Filming was primarily in St. Louis, Missouri, which substituted for a number of other cities shown in the film. Several scenes were also filmed in Detroit, Michigan, Omaha, Nebraska, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Miami, Florida.
Reitman heavily promoted Up in the Air with personal appearances during film festivals and other showings, starting with the Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2009. The Los Angeles premiere was at the Mann Village Theater on Monday, November 30, 2009. Paramount scheduled a limited North American release on December 4, 2009, broadening the release on December 11, 2009, with a wide release on December 23, 2009.
The National Board of Review and the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association named Up in the Air the Best Picture of 2009. It received eight Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations and garnered a win for Adapted Screenplay, six Golden Globe nominations, earning a win for Best Screenplay, and three Screen Actors Guild nominations. It received six Academy Award nominations, but did not win in any category. Up in the Air also received recognition from numerous critics' associations.
Plot
Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) makes his living traveling to workplaces around the United States and breaking the news to workers that they have been let go for employers unwilling to do it themselves. Ryan also delivers motivational speeches, using the analogy &quot;What's In Your Backpack?&quot; to extol the virtues of a life free of burdens like relationships with people as well as things, arguing that the best way to live is to travel light, with little to hold you down.
Ryan relishes his perpetual travels. His personal ambition is to earn ten million frequent flyer miles with American Airlines. While traveling, he meets another frequent flyer named Alex (Vera Farmiga). They begin a casual relationship, meeting whenever they can arrange to cross paths.
Ryan is unexpectedly called back to his company's offices in Omaha, Nebraska. An ambitious, freshly graduated new hire, Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) is promoting a plan to cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan argues that Natalie knows nothing about the actual process, live or not, as she has never fired anyone and does not know how to handle upset people. He plays the role of a fired employee to show her inexperience. His boss (Jason Bateman) assigns him to take Natalie with him on his next round of terminations, much to his annoyance.
As they travel together and become better acquainted, Natalie questions Ryan's philosophy, but he is satisfied with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message. Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex in spite of their obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterwards they are ordered back to Omaha to begin implementing Natalie's program. There are problems during a test run; one laid off man breaks down in tears before the camera, and she is unable to comfort him.
Instead of returning immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex to accompany him to his younger sister Julie's (Melanie Lynskey) wedding near Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He learns that the reason that Julie had him take photos of a cutout picture of her and future husband Jim (Danny McBride) in various places is because they cannot afford a honeymoon trip. When Jim gets cold feet, Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade Jim to go through with it. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy of non-commitment, he persuades Jim that &quot;everyone needs a co-pilot&quot; and the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding takes place without any further problems.
Ryan begins having second thoughts about his own life. As he starts to deliver his &quot;What's In Your Backpack?&quot; speech at a convention in Las Vegas, he realizes he no longer believes it and walks off the stage. On an impulse, he flies to Alex's home in Chicago, Illinois. When she opens the door, he is stunned to discover she is a married woman with children; Ryan leaves without saying a word. She later tells him on the phone that her family is her real life and he is simply an escape.
On his flight home, the crew announces that Ryan has just crossed the ten million mile mark. The airline's chief pilot (Sam Elliott) comes out of the cockpit to meet Ryan. He notes that Ryan is the youngest person to reach the milestone; Ryan, who had been awaiting that moment for a long time is speechless.
Back in his office, Ryan calls the airline to transfer five hundred thousand miles each to his sister, Julie, and brother-in-law, Jim Miller, enough for them to fly around the world for their honeymoon. His boss then tells Ryan that a woman he and Natalie fired has killed herself, and that an upset Natalie has quit via text message and left without another word. The company puts the remote-layoff program on hold because of government concerns and puts Ryan &quot;back on the road&quot;.
Natalie applies for a job in San Francisco, California. The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her. The film concludes with Ryan standing in front of a vast destination board, looking up, and letting go of his luggage, echoing a sentiment expressed by Natalie earlier.

Themes
The film has a thematic connection to the children's book The Velveteen Rabbit, which appears in the film, before the wedding.4
Reitman noted that
In one sense, it's a movie about a man who fires people for a living. In another sense, it's a movie about a man who collects air miles excessively. In another sense, it's about a man who meets a woman who's so similar to him that even though they both believe in the idea of living solo, they begin to fall in love.5
Reitman also later stated that &quot;the movie is about the examination of a philosophy. What if you decided to live hub to hub, with nothing, with nobody?&quot;6
Production
Background
Walter Kirn wrote Up in the Air, the book on which the film is based, during a snowbound winter on a ranch in rural Montana, while thinking about airports, airplanes and first-class passengers he had met who would strongly resemble Ryan Bingham.7 The novel was published in 2001 and, shortly after, Sheldon Turner discovered the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003.8
Canadian-American filmmaker Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the Christopher Buckley blurb on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup.910 Reitman persuaded his father, Canadian-American filmmaker Ivan Reitman, to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted Griffin and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the original script that was (unbeknownst to Reitman) written by Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were used in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech (&quot;Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now...&quot;), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).1112 Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, and later admitted to being confused when the Writers Guild of America ruled that he should share credit with Turner, whose script Reitman claimed to have never read. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit, after Turner's contribution to the final product had been made clear.1314 At a press screening, Reitman also said that his father Ivan had written &quot;the best line in the movie.&quot;15
Casting
Though Reitman has claimed in countless interviews that he wrote the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis,1617 some of his actors have publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting other actors all along including for his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played.18 On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk a fine line between aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, &quot;If you're going to make a movie about a guy who fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes.&quot;19 Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin &quot;his Lost in Translation.&quot;2021
Approximately 4,600 people applied to be extras in the film during the open call on January 24, 2009 and January 25, 2009 at Crestwood Court in St. Louis, Missouri.22 Up in the Air cast 2,000 extras23 with 15 to 25 Missouri actors in minor speaking roles. About 250 extras were used from the Omaha, Nebraska, area. They were used for filming inside and outside the terminal at Eppley Airfield, while Clooney shot most of his scenes inside the terminal.24
While shooting the film in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman placed an ad in the paper asking if people who recently lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified &quot;documentary&quot; in the ad so actors would not respond to the ad. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it was for these people.25 They received a startling amount of responses, with 100 responses, including 60 people on camera (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis).26 Twenty-two made it into the film.27 They interviewed them for about ten minutes on what it is like to lose their job in this kind of economy, and after that they would &quot;fire&quot; them on camera and ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.282930
Filming
Filming was mostly done in the St. Louis area. Several scenes were also filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals at Detroit Metro Airport in late February 20093132 with minimal filming in Omaha, Nebraska, in Las Vegas, Nevada33 and in Miami, Florida.34 Missouri and St. Louis leaders provided $4.1 million in tax credits for the $25 million film.35 Producers set up a St. Louis, Missouri production office on January 5, 2009.36 Filming began in St. Louis on March 3, 2009 and continued through the end of April.37 The film includes 80 different sets at 50 locations throughout the St. Louis area, including Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Concourse C and Concourse D3839 (which played the part of several airports around the country), the Mansion House apartments in downtown St. Louis,40 Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark, Hilton St. Louis Airport,41 the Cheshire Inn, the GenAmerica building, Renaissance Grand Hotel, Maplewood United Methodist Church and Affton High School.42 The film was shot at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for five days, twenty hours each day.43
In October 2008 Production Services of Omaha scouted locations in Omaha, Nebraska44 for three days of filming in late April with Clooney.4546 Some of the scenes were shot inside the Visitor's Bureau and in a condo in the Old Market area of downtown Omaha47 and at the south end of the main terminal at Eppley Airfield.48
Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, eight of which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots turned out to be more difficult than he had expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many of the aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are featured in the trailer but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carries the space shuttle flew the aircraft used for the aerial shots.4950
The film features heavy product placement, with American Airlines,51 Chrysler, Hertz, Travelpro, and Hilton Hotels52 all featured prominently.5354 Competing brands are displayed only as blurs in scene backgrounds or are replaced with pseudonyms in dialogue. However, the brands did not pay for the exposure; rather, they exchanged shooting locations, such as AA's airport areas and Hilton hotels.55 Reitman expressed his desire to use real brands as he finds them less distracting.56
Editing
The post-production schedule for Up in the Air was shorter than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas usually the editing deadline is from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman was involved in post-production during shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in L.A. to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would look at them. He flew home every weekend to work with her for a few hours on Saturdays or Sundays in order to stay on schedule.57
Editing helped determine how nonverbal moments shape the first meeting between Ryan and Alex, who become lovers. &quot;In a scene like that, there is a sort of playfulness that goes on,&quot; editor, Dana E. Glauberman said. &quot;There were little looks that they gave each other. Sometimes I stayed a beat longer on a take to get that little sparkle in their eyes ... You can see a lot of playfulness in the quick cuts back and forth when they are teasing each other, but then there are also certain moments that Vera would give a little raise of an eyebrow, or George would give the same thing. Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after.&quot;58
Soundtrack
Up in the Air is the official soundtrack to the film, released by Warner Music on November 9, 2009,59 and composed by Rolfe Kent, who recorded his score with a 55-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.60
Kevin Renick wrote the song &quot;Up in the Air&quot; two years prior to knowing that Reitman was working on a film adaptation to the book.61 He had been laid off at the time, and was an unrecorded, unemployed St. Louis musician. When Renick researched the film he discovered that the theme of the film was much the same as the song he had written. &quot;The song is about uncertainty, disconnection and loneliness, while alluding to career transition,&quot; Renick explained. &quot;It's a melancholy song, and a narrative about finding out where your life's going to go.&quot;62 He handed a cassette to Reitman after the director did an interview at Webster University. Renick included a spoken-word introduction about the song on the cassette so that Reitman would know why he was giving the song to him. Reitman found a tape deck, listened, liked the song and placed the original introduction and song from the cassette midway through the credits. Reitman stated that the song has a do-it-yourself authenticity.636465
Release
Strategy
 Reitman heavily promoted Up in the Air with personal appearances during film festivals and other showings. He stated that he could relate to and enjoys the idea of Ryan Bingham's lifestyle. &quot;Yesterday [October 28, 2009] I took my 10th flight in 10 days so I live that life myself and I kinda enjoy it,&quot; Reitman said, &quot;I think when you're in an airplane it's the last refuge for the people who enjoy being alone and reading a book.&quot;66
Reitman documented his experiences promoting the film. He took photos of everyone who interviewed him and recorded videos in each and every city he visited. He edited these images together into a short video titled &quot;Lost In The Air: The Jason Reitman Press Tour Simulator&quot;.67

Critical reception
 The film received generally positive reviews from film critics.149 Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 90% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 241 reviews, with a rating average of 8.1 out of 10. The critical consensus is: &quot;Led by charismatic performances by its three leads, director Jason Reitman delivers a smart blend of humor and emotion with just enough edge for mainstream audiences.&quot;150 Among Rotten Tomatoes' &quot;Top Critics&quot;, which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television and radio programs, the film holds an overall approval rating of 92%, based on a sample of 37 reviews.151 Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 83 based on 36 reviews.152 The sneak preview of Up in the Air was the highest profile hit during the Telluride film festival.153 The film also tied for third place in the Toronto International Film Festival indieWire poll.154
Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, &quot;Up in the Air makes it look easy. Not just in its casual and apparently effortless excellence, but in its ability to blend entertainment and insight, comedy and poignancy, even drama and reality, things that are difficult by themselves but a whole lot harder in combination. This film does all that and never seems to break a sweat.&quot;155 Entertainment Weekly{{'s}} Owen Gleiberman agreed, rating the film an A as a &quot;rare and sparkling gem of a movie, directed by Jason Reitman with the polish of a master.&quot;156
Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the film's sense of timeliness, writing, &quot;It's tough to capture an era while it's still happening, yet Up in the Air does so brilliantly, with wit and humanity ... Reitman emerges as a modern-day Frank Capra, capturing the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience.&quot;157 Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, &quot;It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films.&quot;158 Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote &quot;Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film &lt;U+2013&gt; but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for.&quot;159 Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, &quot;This isn't a comedy. If it were, it would be hard to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how a man does a job.&quot;160
Calling the film &quot;a slickly engaging piece of lightweight existentialism,&quot; Todd McCarthy wrote in Variety that &quot;Clooney owns his role in the way first-rate film stars can, so infusing the character with his own persona that everything he does seems natural and right. The timing in the Clooney-Farmiga scenes is like splendid tennis.&quot;161 The New York Times' Manohla Dargis especially appreciated the film's strong female roles, noting that &quot;the ferocious Ms. Kendrick, her ponytail swinging like an ax, grabs every scene she's in,&quot; but wrote that the film &quot;is an assertively, and unapologetically, tidy package, from its use of romance to instill some drama ... and the mope-rock tunes that Mr. Reitman needlessly overuses.&quot;162
The Chicago Tribune{{'s}} Michael Phillips wrote, &quot;Up in the Air is a slickly crafted disappointment. [It] feels tailor-made for George Clooney, who is very good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns to be a little less the man he was.&quot;163 Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, &quot;There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying.&quot;164 J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, &quot;Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes ... [the film] warns that you can't go home again&lt;U+2014&gt;and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can.&quot;165
Shave Magazine{{'s}} Jake Tomlinson gave the film four out of five stars and wrote that &quot;There is a very strong sense of humor as well as emotional depth, yet the scope of the film sometimes limits these sentiments. As a moviegoer, this film provides a satisfying experience where one can take a step back to ponder some of the finer points in our daily lives, but don't expect to find all the answers here.&quot;166
Accolades
