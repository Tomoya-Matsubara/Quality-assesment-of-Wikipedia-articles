Israel the Grammarian (fl. c. 900 - c. 960) was one of the leading European scholars in the middle of the tenth century. He was probably a Breton, and spent some time at the court of King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan of England (924-939). When &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan died, Israel successfully sought the patronage of Archbishop Rotbert of Trier, and became tutor to Bruno, who was later to be Archbishop of Cologne. Israel is recorded as a bishop in the late 940s, and at the end of his life he was a monk at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier.
Israel was an accomplished poet. A disciple of the ninth-century Irish philosopher, John Scottus Eriugena, he was one of the few scholars of his time to understand Greek. He wrote theological and grammatical tracts, and commentaries on the works of other philosophers and theologians.
Sources
Poems and prose works by Israel survive, as do manuscripts containing his copies of and commentaries on works by other scholars. A text known as the &quot;Gospel Dice&quot; shows that he spent some time at the court of King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan, and he is mentioned in tenth-century continental source such as Flodoard's chronicle and Ruotger's life of Bruno.1 Israel is the subject of essays by a number of modern historians, including Michael Lapidge2 and Michael Wood.3
Early life
Very little is known about Israel's early life. Michael Lapidge dates his birth to around 900,4 while Michael Wood places it slightly earlier, around 890.5 He was a disciple of Ambrose, and spent some time at Rome, but it is not known who Ambrose was or whether he was Israel's tutor in Rome.6 In Wood's view he was a monk at Saint-Maximin in Trier in the 930s.7
Tenth-century sources provide conflicting evidence on Israel's origin. Ruotger referred to Israel as Irish, whereas Flodoard described him as &quot;Britto&quot;, which may refer to Brittany, Cornwall or Wales.8 According to Michael Lapidge:
There is pervasive confusion in tenth-century continental sources as to whether Israel was a Briton (from Wales or Cornwall), a Breton (from Britanny) or an Irishman. The consensus of modern scholarship is in favour of an Irish origin, but the matter has not been properly investigated.9
Lapidge argues that the bishop of Bangor in County Down, Dub Innse, described Israel as a &quot;Roman scholar&quot;, and that he therefore does not appear to have recognised him as a fellow Irishman, and further that Flodoard was contemporary with Israel and may have known him, whereas Ruotger wrote after Israel's death and probably did not have first hand knowledge. Giving children Old Testament Hebrew names was common in Celtic areas in the tenth century. Lapidge concludes that Brittany is more likely than Wales or Cornwall, as manuscripts associated with him have Breton glosses, and &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's court was a haven for Breton scholars fleeing Viking occupation of their homeland.10
Michael Wood has revived the Irish theory, arguing that Flodoard's 'Israel Britto' &quot;can hardly be pressed as meaning 'Breton'&quot;, and that Ruotger knew Israel,11 but his view is rejected by Sarah Foot, who states that Israel was not Irish and may have been a Breton.12 Thomas Charles-Edwards thinks he may have been Welsh.13 
&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's court
Israel's presence in England is known from a gospel book written in Ireland in about 1140, which contains a copy of a tenth-century drawing and explanation of a board game called &quot;Gospel Dice&quot;, based on canon tables (concordances for parallel texts of the four gospels). According to a note on the manuscript:
Here begins the Gospel Dice which Dub Innse, bishop of Bangor, brought from the English king, that is from the household of &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan, King of England, drawn by a certain Franco [or Frank] and by a Roman scholar, that is Israel.14
Dub Innse, who died in 853, was bishop of Bangor in County Down, Ireland. The twelfth-century copyist appears to have changed Dub Innse's original first person note to the third person. In a later passage, he interpreted &quot;Roman scholar, that is Israel&quot; as meaning a Roman Jew (Iudeus Romanus). This has been taken by some historians, including David Wasserstein, as showing that there was a Jewish scholar at &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's court, but MIchael Lapidge argues that this interpretation was a misunderstanding by the copyist, and his view has been generally accepted by historians.15 Israel is thought to be Israel the Grammarian, described as a Roman scholar because of his time in the city, and the Gospel Dice manuscript shows that he spent a period at &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's court. A number of manuscripts associated with Israel, including two of the four known copies of his poem De arte metrica, were written in England.16 In the view of Sarah Foot:
Israel provides a tantalising link between the spheres of masculine camaraderie of a conventional royal court and the more rarified, scholarly atmosphere that &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan may have liked both his contemporaries and posterity to think he was keen to promote.17
Israel was a practitioner of the &quot;hermeneutic style&quot; of Latin, which was characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. He probably influenced the scribe known to historians as &quot;&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan A&quot;, an early exponent of the style in charters he drafted between 928 and 935. Hermeneutic Latin was to become the dominant style of the Benedictine reform movement of the later tenth century, and Israel may have been an early mentor of one of its leaders, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold, Bishop of Winchester, at &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's court in the 930s.18 The Latin texts which Israel brought to &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's court were influenced by Irish writers, and Jane Stevenson sees them as contributing a Hiberno-Latin element to the hermeneutic style in England.19
Later career
Israel's poem De arte metrica was dedicated to Rotbert, Archbishop of Trier. The poem was almost certainly composed in England, and the dedication was probably a successful plea for Rotbert's patronage when Israel when &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan died in 939. From about 940 Israel was the tutor of Bruno, the future Archbishop of Trier and brother of the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto the Great. In 947 Israel attended a synod at Verdun presided over by Rotbert.20 Israel was famous as a schoolmaster, and he probably played an important role in Emperor Otto's establishment of a court school at Aachen.21
Tenth-century sources describe Israel as a bishop, and in about 950 a man with this name is identified as bishop of Aix-en-Provence, but it is not certain that he was Israel the Grammarian.22 Between 948 and 950 he may have held a bishopric in Aachen, where he debated Christian ideas about the Trinity with a Jewish intellectual called Salomon, probably the Byzantine ambassador of that name.23 He retired to become a monk at the monastery of Saint-Maximin in Trier, and died on 26 April in an unknown year. Lapidge sets his death in about 970, whereas Wood dates it before the 967-8.24
Scholarship
Charters produced from 928 by King &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan's scribe, &quot;&lt;U+00C6&gt;thelstan A&quot;, include unusual words almost certainly copied from the Hiberno-Irish poems Adelphus adelphe, and Rubisca. They display a sophisticated knowledge of Greek, and are described by Lapidge as &quot;immensely difficult&quot;. It is likely that the poems were brought by Israel from the Continent and Adelphus adelphe was probably, and Rubisca possibly, his work.2526
Mechthild Gretsch calls Israel &quot;one of the most learned men in Europe&quot;,27 and Michael Lapidge says that he was &quot;an accomplished grammarian and poet, and one of the few scholars of this time to have first-hand knowledge of Greek.&quot;28 He also wrote on theology and collected works of medicine.29 In the 940s he became interested in the work of John Scottus Eriugena, and commented on them in a manuscript which survives in Leningrad.30 In another manuscript glossing Porphryr's Isagoge, he recommended John's Periphyseon. His redaction of a commentary on Donatus's Ars Minor was a major teaching text in the Middle Ages and was still in print in the twentieth century.31
