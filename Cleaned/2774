 List of Irish Victoria Cross recipients lists all Irish-born recipients of the Victoria Cross (post-nominal letters &quot;VC&quot;), together with the date and place of their VC action. The Victoria Cross is the highest war honour of the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations. Since 1881 it has been awarded to service personnel for extraordinary valour and devotion to duty while facing a hostile force. Between 1858 and 1881 the Victoria Cross could be awarded for actions taken &quot;under circumstances of extreme danger&quot; not in the face of the enemy. Six people were awarded Victoria Crosses under this clause until it was amended in 1881 to only allow acts &quot;in the presence of the enemy&quot;.1 It was awarded to members of the British Armed Forces which included Irish service personnel until 1922. It is currently available to personnel of any rank in any service, and to allies serving under or with British Forces. It is the highest honour in the Commonwealth honours system, placed before all other orders, decorations and medals. As of April 2008, this list is composed of 188 names of those recipients who were born in Ireland or had full Irish parentage.
Both Catholic and Protestant officers and servicemen born in Ireland served alongside each other in the British Military.2 During the previous two centuries they had a common military background, and irrespective of class or creed many were decorated with the British highest award for valour. 30 Irish VC recipients received awards in the Crimean war, 52 Irish VCs in the Indian Mutiny, 46 Irish VCs in numerous other British Empire campaigns between 1857 to 1914, 37 Irish VCs in the First World War and eight Irishmen received VC awards for valour in the Second World War.
