Li Jiawei () (born 9 August 1981) is a China-born Singaporean table tennis player who is ranked among the top ten athletes in her sport. Spotted by Singapore talent scouts in Beijing in 1995, she moved to Singapore and commenced her international career in competitive table tennis in 1996. She became a Singapore citizen at the age of 18 years under the Foreign Sports Talent Scheme.
As a singles player, Li was ranked sixth in the world as of August 2008. Her highest ranking was in December 2005, when she was third. Li is also a key player for women's team and doubles, and mixed doubles events. She finished in fourth place in singles at both the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. On 15 August, the Singapore women's team comprised of Li and her teammates Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu defeated South Korea 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 in the semifinals. However in the finals on 17 August, the team lost to China and obtained a silver medal, marking the first time that Singapore had won an Olympic medal since the nation's independence in 1965. The medal came 48 years after Tan Howe Liang won the country's first medal, a silver in weightlifting at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.

Subsequently, she won the women's singles at the ITTF Pro Tour Russia Open. She also achieved third place in the ITTF Pro Tour Grand Finals and the Women's World Cup, which are two of the most prestigious and difficult competitions in the table tennis arena. At the 15th Asian Games held from 29 November to 7 December 2006 in Doha, Qatar, she achieved three medals: a silver for the women's team event and two bronzes for the women's singles and mixed doubles.20 The next year, she won gold in the singles at the ITTF Pro Tour Chinese Taipei Open in Taipei,21 and helped Singapore to the top spots in the women's team22 and mixed doubles23 events at the 2007 SEA Games in Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat), Thailand.

2008 Summer Olympics
Li represented Singapore for the third time in the Olympic Games at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She was the flag-bearer for Team Singapore at the opening ceremony of the Games on 8 August, having requested the honour. She explained: &quot;There has been so much debate over the foreign talent scheme. This is my way of showing everyone that everything I've ever achieved is because of Singapore.&quot;27
At the Beijing Olympics, table tennis team events are played in a best-of-five-matches format. Teams play two single matches followed by a doubles match. If there is no winner after these matches, the teams play a fourth singles match, and if necessary a rubber match to determine the winning team.28 On 13 August, the Singapore women's table tennis team coached by Liu Guodong, comprising Li as the team captain and her teammates Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu, beat teams from the United States and Nigeria with comfortable 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 wins.29 On 14 August, the Singapore team also defeated the Netherlands 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 to reach the semifinals, but not before a gruelling five-game doubles match against the Dutch players Li Jie and Elena Timina which Li Jiawei and Wang Yuegu eventually won 3–2.30 The next day, 15 August, the Singapore team defeated the South Korean team of Dang Ye-Seo, Kim Kyung-Ah and Park Mi-Young 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 in the semifinals, which went to five matches. Li lost her singles match to Korea's Kim, but beat Kim and Park in the doubles with her partner Wang. Singapore's Feng won both her singles matches against Dang and Park.31
On 17 August, Li and her teammates gained Singapore a silver medal in women's table tennis after losing to China in three matches.32 Li won the first game of her singles match, but was then defeated by her former Beijing Sports School teammate33 Zhang Yining. In the doubles match, China's Zhang and Guo Yue bested Singapore's Li and Wang Yuegu. This marked the first time that Singapore had won an Olympic medal since the nation's independence in 1965. The medal came 48 years after Tan Howe Liang won the country's first medal, a silver in weightlifting in the lightweight category at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.34 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong requested that the live English language broadcast of his National Day Rally speech, which coincided with the table tennis finals, be postponed by a day. He also provided the audience with updates on the score, and made a conference call to Tan Eng Liang, Team Singapore's chef de mission, to congratulate the team.35
Li and her teammates received byes into the third round of the singles tournament.36 Asked if she stood a chance of winning any more medals, she said: &quot;I will try my best in every match. I definitely hope to win one more medal for Singapore.&quot;37 She beat Croatia's Tamara Boro&lt;U+0161&gt; in the third round, Hong Kong's Lin Ling in the fourth round, and the USA's Wang Chen in the quarter-finals.38 However, on 22 August she was defeated in the semifinals 4&lt;U+2013&gt;1 by Zhang Yining of China, ranked number one in the world, and lost the bronze medal 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2 to China's Guo Yue. Thus placed fourth in the singles tournament, she equalled her performance in the 2004 Athens Olympics but again failed in her quest for an individual Olympic medal. After the bronze medal match, a tearful Li told reporters this would be her final Olympics.39

Personal life
Li first met Singaporean badminton player and fellow Olympian Ronald Susilo in 2002 at a sports meet.82 They began dating after participating together in the Athens Olympics, and the &quot;golden sports couple&quot;,83 as they were dubbed by the media, announced their engagement in September 2004. About two years later there were rumours that they were breaking up, but these were denied by them at the time.84 On 15 January 2008, when queried by a journalist, Susilo confirmed that he and Li had broken up amicably the previous week.85 Following a report in The Sunday Times that Susilo was contemplating legal action against her to recover money he claimed to have spent in buying their condominium apartment and car, Li disagreed that Susilo had a share in the apartment and implied he was trying to affect her mood and thus her chances of winning a medal at the Beijing Olympics. Susilo declined to discuss the matter with the press, saying it was a private matter between Li and himself; he wished her all the best for the Olympics.86
