G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Xavier Marcel Depardieu (; born 27 December 1948) is a French actor, film-maker, businessman and vineyard owner. He is one of the most prolific character actors in film history, having completed approximately 170 movies since 1967. He has twice won the C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe award for Best Actor in Green Card. After he garnered huge critical acclaim for the title role in Cyrano de Bergerac, which landed him a nomination for an Academy Award, Depardieu acted in many big budget Hollywood movies. He is a Chevalier of the L&lt;U+00E9&gt;gion d'honneur and Chevalier of the Ordre national du M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rite. He was granted citizenship of Russia in January 2013, made an honorary citizen of Belgium in August 2013, and the same year became a cultural ambassador of Montenegro.
Early life
G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard Depardieu was born in Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teauroux, Indre, France. He is one of the five children of Anne Jeanne Jos&lt;U+00E8&gt;phe (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Marillier) and Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Maxime Lionel Depardieu, a metal worker and volunteer fireman.12
Depardieu spent more time on the street than in the classroom and left school at 12.3
Acting career
At the age of 16, Depardieu left Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teauroux for Paris. There, he began acting in the new comedy theatre Caf&lt;U+00E9&gt; de la Gare, along with Patrick Dewaere, Romain Bouteille, Sotha, Coluche, and Miou-Miou.4 He studied dancing under Jean-Laurent Cochet, and went on to become one of France's most renowned actors.
His breakout film role came in 1974 playing Jean-Claude in Bertrand Blier's comedy Les Valseuses (Going Places).5 Other prominent early roles include a starring role alongside Robert DeNiro in Bernardo Bertolucci's historical epic 1900 (1976) and a role in Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Truffaut's The Last Metro (1980), for which he was nominated for a C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Award.
In 1986, his international fame grew as a result of his performance as a doomed, hunchbacked farmer in the film Jean de Florette. Five years later he won a C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar for his starring role in Cyrano de Bergerac, for which he was also nominated for an Academy Award. This is still considered by many to be his most notable role.   
In 1990, Gerard crossed over into the American film market by co-starring in Peter Weir's romantic comedy Green Card, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He has since had other roles in other English-language films, including Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest of Paradise (1992), Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996), and Ang Lee's Life of Pi (2012).
More recently, he has played Ob&lt;U+00E9&gt;lix in the four live-action Ast&lt;U+00E9&gt;rix movies in which he is said to have discovered M&lt;U+00E9&gt;lanie Laurent when she was 14.6
In 2009 he took part in a rare performance of Sardou's La Haine at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier Languedoc Roussillon, with Fanny Ardant; subsequently broadcast on France Musique.7
Personal life
In 1970, Depardieu married &lt;U+00C9&gt;lisabeth Guignot, with whom he had two children, actor Guillaume (1971&lt;U+2013&gt;2008) and actress Julie (1973). On 28 January 1992, while separated from &lt;U+00C9&gt;lisabeth, he had a daughter, Roxanne, with the model Karine Sylla. In 1996 he divorced &lt;U+00C9&gt;lisabeth and began a relationship with actress Carole Bouquet, who was his partner from 1997 to 2005.8
On 14 July 2006, he had a son, Jean, with French-Cambodian H&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Bizot (daughter of Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Bizot and not to be confused with actress H&lt;U+00E9&gt;l&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Bizot), according to the issue 3089 (31 July 2008) of Paris Match and the Phnom Penh Post.9 Since 2005, Depardieu has lived with a Harvard-educated novelist, Cl&lt;U+00E9&gt;mentine Igou.
On 13 October 2008, his son Guillaume, whose health had been severely affected by drugs, a motorbike crash and, most importantly, a hospital infection contracted during the post-accident operations, eventually leading to the amputation of his leg, died at the age of 37 from complications linked to a sudden case of pneumonia.10
In recent years, Depardieu has attracted attention from the media and legal authorities for his behavior. In August 2012, he was accused of assault and battery for punching a motorist in Paris.11 In November 2012, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated after he fell from his scooter, and was found to have a blood alcohol level of 1.8 grams per litre, well above the French limit for driving of 0.5.12
He has been an official resident of N&lt;U+00E9&gt;chin, Belgium since 7 December 2012.13 French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault criticised his move.14 On 15 December 2012, Depardieu publicly stated he was handing back his French passport.1516 On 3 January 2013, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed an Executive Order granting Russian citizenship to Depardieu.17 Depardieu soon returned the favor by attacking Putin's critics.18 Depardieu was made an honorary citizen of Belgium in August 2013.19
Awards
Depardieu has been nominated for the Best Actor in a Leading Role C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar 15 times during his career and won it twice, in 1981 and 1991. He was also nominated for an Oscar in 1990 for his role in Cyrano de Bergerac.
