&quot;Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t&quot; (040/041) (lit. Karl-equipment) was a World War II German self-propelled siege howitzer. It is notable as the largest self-propelled weapon ever built1. It was used to attack the Soviet fortresses of Brest-Litovsk and Sevastopol, bombarded Polish rebels in Warsaw and participated in the Battle of the Bulge and the attacks against the Remagen Bridgehead. Only one survivor exists today.
Development
In March 1936 Rheinmetall made a proposal for a super-heavy howitzer to attack the Maginot Line. The initial concept was for a weapon that would be transported by several tracked vehicles and assembled on site, but the lengthy preparation time drove Rheinmetall to change it to a self-propelled weapon in January 1937. Extensive driving trials took place in 1938 and 1939 using the Neubau Fahrzeug No. 1 and a scale model to investigate the extremely high ground pressure and steering such an enormous vehicle. The full-scale driving trials were held at Unterl&lt;U+00FC&gt;ss in May 1940. Firing trials took place in June 1939.2 Delivery of the six production vehicles took place from November 1940 to August 1941.3 General Karl Becker of the Artillery was involved in the development, from whom the huge weapon gained its nickname.4
In total, seven Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te guns were manufactured. The first six had the nicknames &quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Eva&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Odin&quot;, &quot;Loki&quot;, and &quot;Ziu&quot;; the seventh, the research and test weapon, had no name. In February 1941, discussions commenced concerning increasing the range of the weapon, and in May 1942, 54 cm barrels (Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041) were ordered for the six vehicles. At a conference with Hitler in March 1943 it was stated that the first 54 cm Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041 would be delivered by June 1943, and the third, by mid-August. Only three of the 54 cm barrels were completed and they could be mounted on Nos. I, IV and V5, although any model could be converted to use the smaller weapon. Twenty-two Panzer IV Ausf. D, E and F chassis were modified with a superstructure capable of carrying four shells that replaced the turret and outfitted with a crane as Munitionsschlepper ammunition transporters/loaders.6 Two or three of these Munitionsschlepper were assigned to each weapon.
Description
 The 124 ton vehicle was propelled by a Daimler-Benz MB 503 A 12-cylinder liquid-cooled gasoline engine or a MB 507 C 12 cylinder liquid-cooled diesel engine, but this was mainly used for aiming (the mount had only 4 degrees of traverse on each side) as the engines provided a top speed of only  with massive fuel consumption. For longer distances the Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t was disassembled using a special  crane into seven loads. The chassis was loaded onto a six-axle Culemeyer-Strassenfahrzeug lowboy trailer. The other parts of the gun were lighter and used four-axle trailers. If the trailer with the chassis on board had to cross a bridge that couldn't carry their combined weight the chassis had to be off-loaded and driven across under its own power.7 The weapon was moved long distances via rail on a variant of a Schnabel car; the whole chassis was hung between two huge pedestal-mounted swiveling arms fixed to five-axle bogies.8 When it reached its destination, the weapon was detached from its supporting arms, driven to its intended firing location, then the chassis was lowered to the ground to distribute the recoil forces more evenly in preparation for firing. The Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t proved to have no problems moving over normal soil, but under no circumstances was it allowed to make turns on soft soil lest it throw a track. The chassis had to be backed into position to fire, which expedited movement to a new position, but the firing position had to be precisely leveled and the approach route prepared ahead of time to fill in soft spots and any ditches, etc.9 It could only be loaded at zero elevation, so it had to be re-aimed between every shot.10
Automotive Features
The various Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te used two different types of transmissions, engines and suspension system. The table below outlines how each vehicle was outfitted. After May 1944 the gasoline engines were replaced by diesels. Little information is available for No. VII, the experimental model, and the data below must be regarded as unconfirmed.11

History
1941
On 3 January 1941 schwere Batterie 833 was created at the Bergen training ground and ordered to be combat ready by 15 February 1941. On 2 April 1941 it was expanded into schwere Artillerie Batallion (Heavy Artillery Battalion) 833. The original Batterie 833 was redesignated as the first battery of the new battalion and a new second battery was formed, each battery having two M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rsers, with orders to be combat ready by 1 May 1941 in preparation for Operation Barbarossa. Initially a single battery was to be deployed against the Soviet fortress at Brest-Litovsk, but that was changed by 14 May 1941 when the other battery was to ordered to attack the Soviet border fortifications near Lviv. The First Battery was assigned to IV Army Corps of 17th Army of Army Group South near Lviv while Second Battery was ordered to support the attack by the 4th Army of Army Group Center against the Brest Fortress. The batteries were issued 60 and 36 rounds respectively.12
Little is known of First Battery's operations except that IV Army Corps reported on 23 June that the battery was no longer needed and was no longer operational due to technical deficiencies. Second Battery's weapons had some assembly problems, issues with the electrical firing mechanism and non-standard ammunition, not surprising for the Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t's combat debut, but managed to fire 31 of their 36 rounds by the 24th of June. It was ordered home that day by Army Group Center where the battalion was ordered to reform with eight 21 cm M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rser 18 howitzers on 6 August 1941.13
1942
In preparation for the attack on Sevastopol scheduled for the early summer schwere Artillerie-Abteilung 833 was ordered to form a Karl-Batterie with three M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rsers on 18 February 1942. Camouflaged firing positions  long,  wide and  deep had to be dug for each howitzer to minimize Soviet counter-fire before they could move into position. On 20 May 1942 11th Army reported all three Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te were at the front with a total of 72 s. Betongranate (anti-concrete shells) and 50 le. Betongranate. LIV Army Corps reported that 19 s. Betongranate were fired between 2 and 6 June, 54 on 7 June and all 50 light shells between 8 and 13 June. More shells (29 schwere and 50 leichte) shipped to the battery before the end of the month. All 50 light shells were fired on 30 June and 25 heavy shells the following day. Many of these shells were fired at the two  twin-gun armored turrets of the Maxim Gorkii coast defense battery14, although shells fired at the turrets had little effect other than to jam one of the turrets and possibly knock out electrical power to the turrets, both of which were repaired without too much trouble. They did rather more damage to the concrete structure supporting the turrets as well as the command center located some 600 meters away (called the Bastion by the Germans). On 19 July 1942 the battery was ordered to ship their weapons to Hillersleben for refurbishment.15
On 7 July 1942 schwere Artillerie-Abteilung 833 was ordered to form a new battery with one or two Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te. This was done by 15 August as schwere Batterie 628 (Karl) with two weapons, although sufficient personnel to man three guns was to be furnished by schwere Artillerie-Abteilung 833. On 22 July OKH issued an order to send the batterie to Army Group North to support its planned offensive, Unternehmen Georg, against Leningrad. The order for Unternehmen Georg, dated 22 August, specified Batterie 628 with three guns, presumably with two operational guns and one in reserve. Army Group North reported the batterie's arrival on 1 and 2 September 1942, but the Soviets preempted Georg with heavy attacks against the German forces besieging Leningrad so the Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te didn't get into action.16
On 18 October OKH ordered the 11th Army to transfer the batterie as soon as possible to Leipzig, but the 11th Army asked to retain it to use in a new version of Georg to begin later that month. Georg was again postponed in late October, and later canceled. A new attack, code-named Feuerzauber (Fire Magic), was planned in which the batterie was to participate, but it, too, was canceled after the Soviet encirclement of the German forces attacking Stalingrad. OKH finally ordered the return home of the batterie on 4 December 1942 when it was clear that it had no mission.17
1943
OKH issued orders to create a schwere Artillerie-Abteilung (Karl) on 4 May 1943 using the vehicles and equipment of schwere Artillerie Batterie 628. This became the first battery of the new battalion while the other battery was raised from scratch on 15 May as was the battalion Stab (Headquarters). Each battery had two Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te plus a fifth in reserve. 18th Army of Army Group North had plans to use one Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t against the Oranienbaum Bridgehead west of Leningrad during the summer of 1943, but the battalion was ordered to return the Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te to Leipzig on 8 August. Just like the 833rd the battalion was ordered to reform with eight 21 cm M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rser 18 howitzers on 29 August 1943 with effect by 10 September. A Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te was formed on that same date as caretakers for the weapons. This was redesignated Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Sonder-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t des schwere Artillerie-Abteilung (mot.) 628 (Unit for Special-Equipment of heavy Artillery Battalion (motorized) 628) on 2 June 1944.18
1944
On 13 August 1944 a battery was ordered to be created immediately with one 54 cm Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t and sent to the 9th Army to help it suppress the Warsaw Uprising. The next day the Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Sonder-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te formed the Heeres-Artillerie Batterie (bodenst&lt;U+00E4&gt;ndige) 638 (Army Artillery Battery (Static)) with 60 cm Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VI since no 54 cm weapon was available and a firing table hadn't yet been computed. It arrived at the Warsaw West train station at 0700 on 17 August 1944, although the ammunition train didn't arrive until the following morning.
On 24 August OKH noted that it had been very successful in combat and ordered another Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t sent to Warsaw. A second battery, numbered 428, was formed 2 days later by the Kommando f&lt;U+00FC&gt;r Sonder-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te, but it didn't arrive at the Warsaw West train station until 1257 on 7 September 1944. A third Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 040 was shipped to Warsaw on 10 September and incorporated into H.Art.Bttr. (bo.) 428. Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VI needed repairs and was shipped on 22 September back to J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog. At some point a fourth Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t was shipped to Warsaw as it was reported as operational on 25 September.
Status Report 29 September 1944
A meeting was held on 29 September by the OKH General der Artillerie to discuss the overall status of the Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t, its supporting equipment and ammunition19:
1. Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. I: Set up for both 040 and 041. Currently equipped with 040 with Batterie 428.
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. II: Only set up as 040. Currently being overhauled in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog. Motor installation will be completed in about 14 days.
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. III: About 14 days ago the gun tube blew apart while test firing. Only about 50% is reusable. Hitler has decided that this Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t is to be restored to full operating condition. However, the schedule for restoring it isn't known.
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. IV: Set up for both 040 and 041. Currently equipped as 040 with Batterie 428.
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. V: Set up for both 040 and 041. Equipped as a 040, it will be sent to Batterie 638 in Budapest.
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VI: Only set up as 040. Came back from employment in Warsaw. Repairs will be completed in about 20 days.
Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VII: Versuschsger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041 (Research equipment for the 041 weapon) Currently with the Waffenamt for test firing and obtaining firing table data. It is not currently operational because important components (engine) are being overhauled and won't be operational before April 1945.
2. Guns
Six  041 guns have been ordered. Three have been completed and are stored in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog. A decision on the other three is requested because delivery will take at least 14 months.
3. 35 ton Crane Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te can only be employed when each battery has a 35 ton crane. Two are in service, one is in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog without its trailer, which was destroyed by fire.
 4. Culemeyer-Strassenfahrzeuge Each battery needs one complete set of these heavy transport trailers. The two sets in service are set up for 040. Three 16-wheel trailers set up for 040 are available. Another 24-wheel trailer must be acquired to employ any additional Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te.
5. Munitionsschlepper 13 total, of which 6 are with Batteries 428 and 638, 2 with Waffenamt for 040, 2 converted to 041 and 2 available.
6. Ammunition a. Munition 040: 264 shells are immediately available, of which 150 are planned to be allotted to Batterie 638. Another 96 will be completed in the next few days. 241 round are in Unterluss to change their high explosive filler. About 10 completed daily. Part of the cartridges must be reworked. Powder testing will occur on 5 October so that the rest of the ammunition can be refilled.
b. Munition 041: 50 Betongranaten have been delivered to Hillersleben to be shot for firing table data in early October. 25 Betongranaten will still be delivered by the end of September, another 25 by the end of October, from then on 50 per month are planned. 50 Sprenggranaten are to be completed for firing table data in November. In early 1945 a total of 60 rounds of Spreng- and Betongranaten are to be produced monthly.
Three days later H.Art.Bttr. 638 was ordered to transfer to Budapest and was loaded without any Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t. Nr. V was rerouted to Budapest to equip the battery. H.Art.Bttr. 428 followed on 10-11 October 1944. Both batteries were ordered back to Warsaw on 19 October, although they didn't arrive until 28 October. On 6 November H.Art.Bttr. 638 transferred one Karl-Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 040 to H.Art.Bttr. 428 and returned to J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 10 November to rearm with a Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te 041. H.Art.Bttr. 428 didn't remain near Warsaw much longer and departed for J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog itself on 15 November.20
Batterie 428 exchanged its guns for Nr. II and VI (both with Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te 040) and departed for the West on 14 December 1944 to participate in Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein (Operation Watch on the Rhine), which would be known by Americans as the Battle of the Bulge, but didn't reach the front until 29 December. Batterie 628 followed on 20 December after equipping with Nr. IV, the first 54 cm Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t 041 to be committed to battle.21
1945
Little is known of their activities during the battle, but Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. II was damaged enroute by a bomb and was back in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 6 January 1945. It was repaired using parts from Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. I by 3 February. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. IV was damaged by a number of penetrating hits and arrived in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 31 January. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t Nr. VI was still at the front on 19 January. In the meantime Nr. V was converted to use the 54 cm howitzer and had its engine rebuilt.
Batterie 628 was initially ordered to the Vistula Front on 7 March, but this was countermanded on 11 March and the Batterie was sent west to the Remagen area. The OKW war diary reported that 14 rounds were fired at the Remagen Bridgehead on 20 March 1945. Batterie 428 was also ordered west on 11 March, but was to serve in the 1st Army sector.
A status report dated 22 March showed Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te Nr. I and IV were still at J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog, with Nr. I configured as a 040 and Nr. IV to be completed as a 041. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;te Nr. II and V had left for the front on 11 and 10 March respectively. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t VI was returning to J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog with engine damage. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t III had been virtually destroyed and only the gun breech was salvageable. Ger&lt;U+00E4&gt;t VII needed parts and wasn't going to be made operational anytime soon.
Batterie 628 was ordered disbanded on 11 April and its personnel incorporated into Batterie 428, although it's unlikely that either unit actually saw action except in local defense.22
Fate
 In 1945, Nr. II (&quot;Eva&quot;) as well as Nr. V (&quot;Loki&quot;) were captured by US forces in the period 21 March to 11 April 1945. Nr. VII (experimental chassis) was captured by the US Army in Hillersleben and later shipped to Aberdeen Proving Grounds but later scrapped.23 Nr. VI (&quot;Ziu&quot;)was captured by the Red Army, probably at J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog on 20 April 1945. This is on display at Kubinka, although marked as Nr. I (&quot;Adam&quot;).24 Nr. IV (&quot;Odin&quot;) was also captured by the Red Army. The fate of guns Nr. I (&quot;Adam&quot;) and Nr. III (&quot;Thor&quot;) are not known. It is probable both were captured by the Red Army in J&lt;U+00FC&gt;terbog.
