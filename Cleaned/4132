Francisco M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida P&lt;U+00E9&gt;rez (born 4 March 1990 in Barcelona, Catalonia) is a Spanish footballer who plays for Arsenal as a midfielder.
Career
Barcelona
M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida joined the youth ranks of FC Barcelona at the age of eight1 but left the club in September 2005 and was reportedly hidden away by his agent, Joseba D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az leading to speculation that he would leave for England with no compensation for the Spanish club as was the case when Cesc F&lt;U+00E0&gt;bregas joined Arsenal from Barcelona. Fran Merida's parents had become uneasy about all the young players joining Barcelona and felt that youngster would have a better chance elsewhere. Therefore, they approached D&lt;U+00ED&gt;az, also Cesc F&lt;U+00E0&gt;bregas' agent, and he promptly alerted Real Madrid, Milan, and Arsenal. Barcelona's fears were realized when M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida joined Arsenal without compensation, as he had not signed a contract with Barcelona.
Contract controversy
On 9 October 2007, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida was ordered by the courts to pay a fee around &lt;U+20AC&gt;3.2m to FC Barcelona as compensation for his &quot;failing to meet the terms of a personal pre-contract&quot; with Barcelona.2 The decision was said to have serious implications for clubs in England, where players can sign professional contracts at 17, one year earlier than in Spain. In response, a Madrid-based lawyer, Rodrigo Garc&lt;U+00ED&gt;a, was quoted as saying, &quot;English teams will now think again before signing a young Spanish player ... It's an important ruling.&quot;3 Arsenal footed the bill on M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida's behalf, and David Dein, then vice-chairman, struck a diplomatic truce with Barcelona, promising to pay the compensation as well as promising to be more circumspect in their scouting of their youth team.4
Arsenal
He signed professional terms with Arsenal after his 17th birthday.5 He scored on his first team debut for Arsenal in a friendly against Boreham Wood in August 2006.6 His competitive first-team debut came on 25 September 2007, when he came on as a 91st minute substitute in Arsenal's 2-0 victory over Newcastle in the League Cup third round,7 and he made further substitute's appearances in a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win against Sheffield United in the fourth round, and a 3&lt;U+2013&gt;2 win against Blackburn Rovers in the quarter-finals. On 3 April 2008, M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida extended his deal with Arsenal by signing a long-term (unspecified) contract, securing his future with Arsenal. He is expected to play an important role in the future as manager Ars&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne Wenger described him as &quot;an absolutely amazing player&quot;. He scored his first goal for the club against Liverpool in the Carling cup where Arsenal won 2-1.8
Loan to Real Sociedad
On 27 December 2007, I&lt;U+00F1&gt;aki Badiola, then-prospective presidential candidate of the Spanish club Real Sociedad, claimed he agreed a loan deal with Arsenal for M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida till the end of the Segunda Divisi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n season. Badiola became Real Sociedad president on 4 January and Merida's loan to Real Sociedad was confirmed five days later.9 He made 14 appearances during the loan, scoring once while being credited with six assists.
Return to Arsenal
For the 08/09 season M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida returned to Arsenal, he made his first start for Arsenal in a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win over Sheffield United in the League Cup on 23 September 2008. He started on the left wing for the League Cup home tie against Wigan Athletic on November 2008 in which Arsenal won the game 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0, with Merida playing the whole match. On 2 March 2009, Arsene Wenger heaped praise on Fran, claiming the reason for him making the bench for the previous few first team games is because &quot;He has been doing very, very well. He looks really good in training and is getting stronger all the time.&quot; M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida made his Premier League debut, coming off the bench for Samir Nasri with just 8 minutes to go in the 3&lt;U+2013&gt;1 win at West Brom, hours before his 19th birthday. M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida also finished the season by coming off the bench against Portsmouth.
2009/10 Season
Merida returned from the 2009 UEFA U19 European Championships for the 2009/10 season and was named as a substitute in the Emirates Cup 2009. He came off the bench for Aaron Ramsey in the 67th minute in Arsenal's first match against Atletico Madrid and he started and created a goal for Eduardo against Rangers. Arsenal then went on to win the match 3-0 and regain the Emirates Cup. He was then included in Arsenal's first team for the season and handed shirt number 46 and subsequently came on in the 70th minute against Portsmouth in Arsenal's second Premier League match of the season. He was then upgraded to shirt number 32, formerly worn by Theo Walcott. In a Carling Cup game against Liverpool F.C, Merida scored a screamer from the edge of the area, hitting the post on its way past Liverpool F.C goalkeeper Diego Cavalieri.10 After the game, Arsene Wenger confirmed how M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida was close to joining Levante on loan at the start of the season, but changed his mind at the last minute because he had &quot;too much quality&quot; to let him leave for a season.11 With M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida's contract due to expire in June 2010, the youngster confirmed he's having talks with the club over a new deal and hope's they can come to an agreement12, while Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo showed his interest in bringing the youngster back to Spain if something isn't worked out between player and club.13 On November 5th, Arsenal confirmed that M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida had verbally agreed a deal with the club, but it had yet to be signed.14 Arsene Wenger then accused Atletico of tapping up M&lt;U+00E9&gt;rida after announcing their public interest of talking to the youngster, saying &quot;I can't say I'm annoyed by other clubs going after our players because we do it as well. But we do it legally.&quot; &quot;The difference is that we do not do what is not allowed by the law. We try to get the best players everywhere when it is allowed by the rules.&quot;15
