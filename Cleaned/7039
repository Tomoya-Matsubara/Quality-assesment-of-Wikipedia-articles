Ed, Edd n Eddy is an original animated television series created by Danny Antonucci and produced by Canadian-based a.k.a. Cartoon. It premiered on Cartoon Network on January 4, 1999. The series revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as &quot;the Eds,&quot; who hang around in a suburban cul-de-sac. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery; jawbreakers. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments.
Antonucci spent months designing the show similar to classic cartoons of the 1940s. He shopped it to Nickelodeon, which demanded creative control. Antonucci refused to give it, so he took the show to Cartoon Network, which quickly picked it up. There have been a number of specials and shorts produced in which the Eds would appear apart from their regular series airings. A number of video games either based on the series or featuring the series' characters have also been produced. The series' finale movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series. However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On April 6, 2012, the series received another ability to air re-runs on the revived block &quot;Cartoon Planet.&quot;
Ed, Edd n Eddy received generally positive reviews from critics. With a viewership of 31 million households and aired in 29 different countries, Ed, Edd n Eddy was popular amongst kids, as well as adults. Receiving several of awards and nominations, it remains Cartoon Network's longest running original series, as well as the longest running Canadian-made animated series to date, and is considered to be one of Cartoon Network's best works.
Overview
Ed, Edd n Eddy revolves solely around the Eds, the other cul-de-sac children, and the Kanker sisters. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds hang around in a suburban cul-de-sac and constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery; jawbreakers. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments. The series takes place within the fictional town of Peach Creek and new locations are rarely introduced. There is no given timeline for the show. For the first four seasons the show took place during a perpetual summer. Starting with its fifth season, the characters were shown going to school. Most of the episodes begin with something completely unrelated to the storyline of the episode.
The number of characters in Ed, Edd n Eddy is fixed at twelve (thirteen, if Plank, who is also considered a character, is included). Until the debut of the movie Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, where Eddy's brother, an adult, was shown for the first time, no other characters besides the main cast were ever seen; however the show started to hint at the presence of other people in its fifth season, occasionally showing the silhouettes of people and in one episode the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother. Beyond these partial exceptions, Eddy's brother is the only adult to appear on the show.
The show frequently makes meta-references and breaks the fourth wall. In addition, the letters AKA, the abbreviation for the name of the company that produces the show (a.k.a. Cartoon), frequently appear in the show on license plates and other items.
Production
Feeling pigeon-holed as an angst-ridden, &quot;edgy&quot; artist, Antonucci decided to produce an animated children's television show again.1 He resolved, however, to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the classic cartoons of the 1940s.2 Antonucci spent months designing the show, and shopped it to Nickelodeon, which demanded creative control.3 Antonucci refused to give it, so he took the show to Cartoon Network, which quickly picked it up.4 Cartoon Network also wanted Antonucci to show them more of his work, but they decided to let Antonucci go at his own pace.5
Antonucci is a strong advocate of hand-drawn animation. The wobbling animation in Ed, Edd n Eddy is an homage to the hand-drawn cartoons with a style that harkens back to cartoons of the 1930s-1950s.6 To give the impression of movement, Ed, Edd n Eddy uses shimmering character outlines similar to Squigglevision;7 The crawling lines are not nearly as active as those in Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, but are still visible,8 and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.9
According to Danny Antonucci, the characters were based on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on personal traits of himself, and the activities of his two sons.10 The Eds also held personality traits of The Three Stooges, who were a comedy trio whose various characters they portrayed in each short subject film often try to create money-making schemes, but their plans end up backfiring near the end of their films.11 The cul-de-sac kids were based on kids he grew up with.12 Antonucci also stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, stating that he &quot;thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own&quot; and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.13 He also stated that Rolf is strongly based on himself and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.14 The kids have multi-colored tongues because, as Danny Antonucci stated, kids are almost always eating something that turn their tongues different colors.15
It has been noted that there is a lack of adults in the show, which Antonucci stated was intentional explaining, &quot;throughout the long days of summer you simply didn't see anyone else's parents about and sometimes you didn't even see your own. Take the 'Edd's parents' factor, their means of communicating with him via sticky note, my parents worked long hours and they left me written messages in much the same way.&quot;16
The series' finale movie, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.17 However, reruns continued to air on the network until July 1, 2011. On April 6, 2012, the series received another ability to air re-runs on the revived block &quot;Cartoon Planet.&quot;18
Cast
Ed, Edd n Eddy were voiced by Matt Hill, Samuel Vincent and Tony Sampson. Johnny (referred to in the credits as &quot;Jonny 2x4&quot;) was voiced by David Paul Grove, Jimmy by Keenan Christenson, Sarah by Janyse Jaud, Kevin by Kathleen Barr, and Nazz by Tabitha St. Germain in season 1, Jenn Forgie] in season 3 and Erin Fitzgerald in season 2, 4, 5 and 6. May is voiced by Erin Fitzgerald, who also voices Nazz in seasons 2, 4, 5 and 6, except for season 3, when she was voiced by Jenn Forgie, who also voices Nazz in season 3. Marie is voiced by Kathleen Barr, who also Kevin, and Lee is voiced by Janyse Jaud, who also voices Sarah. Eddy's brother is mentioned frequently throughout the series, however, he does not appear in the series until the debut of Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, where he is voiced by Terry Klassen.19
Additional works
 There have been other produced works in which the Eds would appear apart from their regular series airings. They have appeared in a Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends episode using Foster's styled animation,20 and made a short cameo in The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door, a crossover of The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy and Codename: Kids Next Door; They also they appeared in a small crossover poster during its credits entitled Ed, Edd n Mandy.21
Cartoon Network has also produced shorts, some involving the Eds during commercial breaks. There was also a short music video with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Day&quot; (listed on the Season 2 DVD as &quot;I'm Not Coming in Anymore&quot;),22 which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video Sarah uses a potion to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her dollhouse, with predictable results.23 Plank starred in a similar video called &quot;My Best Friend Plank&quot;, which aired in 2002.24
There have been many specials in which Cartoon Network would run all day marathons for either a promotion or just a special airing for one of their shows. A marathon called &quot;The Best Day Edder&quot; aired from April 27 to April 28, 2007, in which every episode was shown in chronological order, ending with the previously unaired last episode of Season 5.25
Amongst others, a special episode of Ed, Edd n Eddy aired on May 11, 2007 in the Cartoon Network event, Invaded, in which aliens invade Rolf's house. This alien invasion is in adjunct with the other Cartoon Network series Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, My Gym Partner's a Monkey, Camp Lazlo, and The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy. The episode is part of &quot;Cartoon Network Invaded,&quot; a mini-series that aired all 5 specials on May 28, 2007.26
Reception
With a viewership of 31 million households and aired in 29 different countries, Ed, Edd n Eddy was popular amongst kids, as well as adults.27 Receiving several of awards and nominations, it remains Cartoon Network's longest running original series, as well as the longest running Canadian-made animated series to date.2829
Ed, Edd n Eddy received generally positive reviews from critis. Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine argued that every second of the show is &quot;filler&quot; and that the main characters are drawn as &quot;products from the school of acid-trip caricature.&quot;30 After the review was published, a very high number of support letters for the show started to pile up at Animation World Magazine{{'}}s website. This caused the magazine to write a more positive review of Ed, Edd n Eddy, calling it a &quot;fresh show with very different approaches.&quot;31 David Cornelius considered the Eds adolescent equivalents of the Three Stooges,32 believing: &quot;The series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily.&quot;33 Cornelius also concurred that the &quot;animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated.&quot;34
