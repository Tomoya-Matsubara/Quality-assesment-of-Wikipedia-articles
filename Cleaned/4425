Operation Perch was a Second World War British offensive that took place between 6–14 June 1944, during the Battle of Normandy. The offensive was intended to encircle and seize the German occupied city of Caen, which was a major Allied objective in the early stages of the invasion of northwest Europe. A combination of fierce German resistance and failures at the British command level foiled the operation before its objectives were achieved.
Operation Perch was originally intended to take place immediately after the British beach landings, and was to be an advance to the southeast of Caen by XXX Corps. This depended on Caen's early liberation, but three days after the invasion the city was still in German hands so the operation was altered. Perch was expanded to include I Corps and became a pincer attack aimed at capturing Caen. Beginning the following day XXX Corps, forming the western arm of the encirclement, pushed south before becoming embroiled with strong German forces in a hotly-contested battle for the town of Tilly-sur-Seulles, which would change hands several times before its liberation. I Corps's eastern thrust was launched two days later from the Orne bridgehead, secured on D-Day by British airborne forces during Operation Tonga, but made little progress in the face of determined resistance and constant counterattacks. With mounting casualties and no sign of an imminent German collapse, by 13 June the offensive east of Caen was abandoned.
Meanwhile, to the west, American pressure had opened up a gap in the German lines. In an attempt to keep operations mobile the 7th Armoured Division was diverted from the combat around Tilly-sur-Seulles and ordered to advance through the gap in a flanking manoeuvre intended to force the Germans to fall back. After two days of intense fighting that included the Battle of Villers-Bocage, on 14 June the division's position was judged untenable and it was withdrawn. Plans were made to resume the offensive once 7th Armoured had been reinforced, but these were dropped when a severe storm in the English Channel seriously disrupted allied supply operations.
Both the decision to exploit the gap and the handling of the subsequent battle have been subjects of controversy. Historians generally agree that, because of failures at the British divisional and corps command levels, an early opportunity to capture Caen was squandered. However, to contain the offensive the Germans had been forced to commit their most powerful armoured reserves in a defensive role, in which they incurred heavy losses and were incapable of counteroffensive operations.
Background
 The Norman town of Caen was a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division, which landed on Sword Beach on 6 June 1944.1 Caen's early capture, while &quot;ambitious&quot;, has been described by historian L F Ellis as the most important D-Day objective assigned to Lieutenant-General Crockers's I Corps.{{#tag:ref|&quot;The quick capture of that key city [Caen] and the neighbourhood of Carpiquet was the most ambitious, the most difficult and the most important task of Lieutenant-General J.T. Crocker's I Corps&quot;.2 Wilmot states &quot;The objectives given to Crocker's seaborne divisions were decidedly ambitious, since his troops were to land last, on the most exposed beaches, with the farthest to go, against what was potentially the greatest opposition.&quot;3 However Miles Dempsey always considered the possibility that the immediate seizure of Caen might fail.4|group=nb}} Operation Overlord called for Lieutenant-General Sir Miles Dempsey's Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l'&lt;U+00C9&gt;vent&lt;U+00E9&gt; to the south-east of Caen, acquiring airfields and protecting the left flank of the United States First Army while it moved on Cherbourg.5 Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give Second Army a suitable staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, which could be used as the pivot for a swing right to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River.6 The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations—the Allies greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units, and transforming the battle into a more fluid engagement would be to their advantage.7
Original plan
According to its pre-D-Day design, Operation Perch was intended to create the threat of a British breakout to the southeast of Caen.8 The operation was assigned to XXX Corps; 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, landing on Gold Beach on 6 June, was tasked with moving rapidly inland to capture Bayeux and the road to Tilly-sur-Seulles.910 The 7th Armoured Division, reinforced with the 8th Armoured Brigade, would then take over from 50th Northumbrian and spearhead a further advance from Tilly-sur-Seulles to Mont Pin&lt;U+00E7&gt;on.1112
Operation Wild Oats
Having landed on Gold Beach at 07:30 on 6 June,13 XXX Corps succeeded in clearing seven exits off the beach and advancing  inland, but because of heavy fighting in Le Hamel were unable to achieve all their D-Day objectives before dark.14 Patrols had reached the outskirts of Bayeux, and contact had been established with elements of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, who had landed on Juno Beach.1516 The 47 Royal Marine Commando, advancing along the coast to link up with the Americans moving inland from Omaha Beach, fell short of reaching Port-en-Bessin-Huppain by .17 On 7 June the bulk of the 7th Armoured Division was landed on schedule and XXX Corps secured its remaining D-Day objectives, including Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin-Huppain.1819
Not all had gone as smoothly for the forces that landed on Sword Beach. I Corps's 3rd Infantry Division had struck inland towards Caen as planned, but had to divert elements to subdue strongly-held German positions along the  route to the town. With its effort being progressively diluted and its armoured support delayed by congestion in the beachhead, the division was unable to generate enough momentum to reach Caen on D-Day and was stopped short of its outskirts by the 21st Panzer Division.20
On 9 June Caen was still firmly in German hands, so the Allied ground forces commander General Bernard Montgomery met with Lieutenant-Generals Miles Dempsey and Omar Bradley (commanding the British Second and United States First Armies) and decided a new plan for Second Army. Caen would be taken with a pincer movement, code-named Operation Wild Oats.{{#tag:ref|Wild Oats was planned by Miles Dempsey and the staff of 2nd Army21|group=nb}}22 The eastern arm of the pincer would consist of I Corps's 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade. The armour and Highlanders would cross into the Orne bridgehead, the ground gained east of the Orne by the 6th Airborne Division during Operation Tonga, and attack southwards to Cagny,  to the southeast of Caen. XXX Corps would form the pincer's western arm. In an alteration to Operation Perch, instead of making for Mont Pin&lt;U+00E7&gt;on the 7th Armoured Division would now swing east, crossing the Odon River to take &lt;U+00C9&gt;vrecy and the high ground near the town (Hill 112).2324 To complete the encirclement it was suggested that the 1st Airborne Division be air-dropped between the two arms, but the allied air commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, opposed this move. He refused to fly the division into Normandy, arguing that the drop would scatter the division too widely to fulfil its objectives, and that the drop zone was in any case too dangerous for his pilots.2526 Despite Montgomery's &quot;bitter anger&quot; at Leigh-Mallory's intransigence,27 the pincer attack went ahead without its airborne component;28 according to historian Hubert Meyer it was incorporated into Operation Perch, and Wild Oats was dropped as a separate operation.29
Main offensive
German preparations
In response to the invasion, late on 7 June I SS-Panzer Corps was transferred from Seventh Army to Panzer Group West.30 The commander of OB West, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, initially ordered the group under General Geyr von Schweppenburg to plan a counterattack for 10 June, but this was aborted by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel as the necessary forces could not be concentrated in time.31 Nevertheless the available German units were rushed forward from their staging areas to contain the Allied beachheads. I SS-Panzer Corps was a powerful formation consisting of the Panzerlehrdivision (one of the strongest divisions in the German army{{#tag:ref|The division contained 237 tanks and assault guns as well as double the number of half-tracked vehicles when compared to other panzer divisions, a total of 658.32|group=nb}}), the &quot;fanatical teenagers&quot;33 of the 12th SS-Panzer Division Hitlerjugend, and the veteran 21st Panzer Division.34 Despite losing up to 200 vehicles to aerial attacks during its  drive from Chartres,{{#tag:ref|Hastings, quoting a post-war interview of Bayerlein, the division's commander, gives losses of 130 trucks, five tanks, and 84 self-propelled guns and other vehicles, of a total complement of over 3000 vehicles.35 However historian Niklas Zetterling calls these losses exaggerated. He states that the Panzerlehr records show the loss of only 92 vehicles during the whole of June 1944.36 Steinhardt quotes Ritgen, author of the divisional history and the commander of 2nd Battalion of the 130th Panzer Regiment's maintenance company during this battle, as saying that Bayerlein's numbers are &quot;probably in excess of reality&quot;.37|group=nb}} the leading elements of Panzerlehr arrived during the night of 9 June in the Tilly-sur-Seulles area opposite XXX Corps.3839 Elements of the 12th SS-Panzer, 21st Panzer and the remains of the 716th Static Infantry Division were moved into positions around Caen, facing I Corps.40
XXX Corps attack
Although a concentrated counter-stroke from all three panzer divisions of I SS-Panzer Corps did not materialise, several attacks were launched against the Anglo-Canadian beachhead north of Caen.4142 XXX Corps established a land link to the Americans on 9 June, and the same day the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division reached the northeast outskirts of Tilly-sur-Seulles and first encountered the tanks of Panzerlehr.43 During the evening Panzerlehr and the 12th SS-Panzer Division counterattacked; although they were beaten off the following morning one British company had been overrun.44 On 10 June the 7th Armoured Division took over portions of 50th Northumbrian's front, with 50th Northumbrian's 56th Infantry Brigade being detached to 7th Armoured.45 By day's end the division had reached Tilly-sur-Seulles's northwest outskirts, and the following day elements entered the town and secured the central crossroads. The British occupation was brief however, as the Panzerlehrdivision launched several counterattacks, forcing a withdrawal.46 Further attempts by 50th Northumbrian bogged down in the bocage, unable to overcome the formidable resistance offered by Panzerlehr.47
I Corps attack
While XXX Corps was battling for control of Tilly-sur-Seulles, on the I Corps front the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade were delayed getting into position, so their attack was rescheduled for 12 June.48 Ludovic Fortin implies that in the event 51st Highland advanced alone, giving the 4th Armoured Brigade's first major combat as Operation Epsom, prior to which it was supporting the 50th Division.49 On 10 June German infantry, supported by armour, launched numerous attacks against the 6th Airborne, who were holding the Orne bridgehead in anticipation of 51st Highland's and 4th Armoured's arrival. The paratroopers held firm and, with naval gunfire support, counterattacked; one captured German officer remarked that his &quot;battalion had been virtually wiped out&quot; during 12 hours of fighting.50 In the evening the Germans attempted to retake Ranville, but this attack was also stopped and then countered, the paratroopers once again inflicting severe losses. The lead formations of 51st Highland arrived during the evening, and the following morning launched an assault on Br&lt;U+00E9&gt;ville. Although this was repulsed with heavy casualties, other elements of the division quickly secured Touffreville.5152
On 12 June further German attacks were launched from the Br&lt;U+00E9&gt;ville area against the Orne bridgehead. Fighting lasted all day and casualties were severe on both sides, but during the evening the Germans pulled back. To close the gap in the British perimeter the decision was made to secure Br&lt;U+00E9&gt;ville. A successful attack was launched by the 12th Battalion the Parachute Regiment that by midnight had captured the village, but of the 160 men that began the attack 141 casualties were sustained.5354 However, 51st Highland was facing stiff and continued resistance from the 21st Panzer Division in its efforts to push south to Saint Honorine, and with the Highlanders unable to make progress, by 13 June the offensive east of Caen was called off.55
Right hook
 On the right flank of XXX Corps the German 352nd Infantry Division had been in contact with the United States 1st Infantry Division since the Omaha Beach landing of 6 June. Having received few replacements for the losses it had sustained, the 352nd Division was unable to resist the continued American pressure and began to buckle, withdrawing south.56 This opened up a  gap in the German lines between the US V Corps and XXX Corps.57
On 12 June Operation Perch was altered.58 Conscious of the opportunity presented, Dempsey met with Lieutenant-General Gerard Bucknall commanding XXX Corps and Major-General George Erskine commanding the 7th Armoured Division, and ordered Erskine to disengage his armour from the fighting around Tilly-sur-Seulles.59 7th Armoured was now to exploit the opening in the German lines, seize the town of Villers-Bocage, and advance into the Panzerlehrdivision's flank.6061 A ridge  to the east of the town was the ultimate goal;62 it was believed that the appearance of British armour in Panzerlehr's rear, occupying high ground and interdicting important lines of communication, would compel the Panzerlehrdivision to withdraw or surrender and thus keep operations fluid.636465
Well aware of their vulnerability, the Germans planned to close the gap in their line with the 2nd Panzer and 3rd Parachute Divisions.66 However, these formations would not be in place until 15 June, so light reconnaissance forces were sent to cover the area.67 In addition I SS-Panzer Corps commander Sepp Dietrich ordered his only reserve, the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, to position itself behind Panzerlehr and 12th SS-Panzer to cover his open left flank.68 Anticipating the importance the British would assign to the high ground near Villers-Bocage,69 the SS-Panzer Battalion 101's 2nd Company, under the command of Michael Wittmann and with only five serviceable Tiger tanks, was positioned just south of Point 213 on the Villers-Bocage ridge.70 It arrived on 12 June after a five day drive from Beauvais.7172
With the 131st Infantry Brigade ready for action, the 7th Armoured Division transferred the 56th Infantry Brigade back to 50th Northumbrian.73 Now consisting of the 131st Infantry and 22nd Armoured Brigades, 7th Armoured set off at 14:00 hours.74 At 20:00 the advance ran into resistance, from the PanzerLehr, at Livry, which took two hours to overcome. Hoping to keep the Germans guessing as to the British objective, Brigadier Hinde, the 22nd Armoured Brigade's commanding officer and in charge of the advance on Villers-Bocage, then ordered a halt for the night.75
Battle of Villers-Bocage
The transport vehicles knocked out by Michael Wittmann
The British advance resumed at 05:30, and around three hours later the vanguard of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group, an ad-hoc force composed of various elements of the 7th Armoured Division and based around the 22nd Armoured Brigade tactical headquarters,{{#tag:ref|The Brigade group consisted of the 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade,76 1/5th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey),77 1/7th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey), 4th County of London Yeomanry, 5th Royal Tank Regiment, 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars,78 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own),79 and the 260th Anti-Tank Battery80|group=nb}} entered the western end of Villers-Bocage.8182 Over the next half hour one squadron of the leading armoured regiment, the 4th County of London Yeomanry, moved through the town and occupied Point 213, an area of high ground to the east. The regimental headquarters and a company of infantry positioned themselves in the eastern end of the village and along the main road.83
At approximately 09:00 the lead British tanks were ambushed by between three and five Tiger I tanks{{#tag:ref|Taylor claims four Tiger tanks engaged the British tanks in this initial ambush; three tanks to the south of the road and a fourth to the north of the road.84|group=nb}} of the 2nd Company, Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101.85868788 One Tiger, under the command of Michael Wittmann, entered Villers-Bocage and destroyed several tanks of the 4th County of London's regimental headquarters and reconnaissance troop. It then engaged additional British armour entering the town from the west before attempting to withdraw.8990 However, Wittmann's Tiger was soon immobilised and he and his crew abandoned it, fleeing towards Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau Orbois to report to the Panzerlehrdivision.9192 In less than 15 minutes, 13–14 tanks, two anti-tank guns and 13–15 transport vehicles had been destroyed by the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, the vast majority being attributable to Wittmann.9394
During the remaining hours of the morning a British infantry battalion from the 22nd Armoured Brigade group took up defensive positions in the town. Meanwhile the troops outside the town on Point 213 had become cut off, so a force was put together to attempt to extricate them.95 This was unable to make any progress towards the ridge,96 and when additional German forces arrived near the high ground between 11:00–13:00, the trapped squadron surrendered.979899 Further German troops were by now harassing other elements of the 22nd Armoured Brigade group along the road back to Livry.100 
Tanks of the Panzerlehrdivision soon arrived with orders to seal off the north and west exits from Villers-Bocage,101 but they encountered British anti-tank guns and several were disabled before the British position was silenced.102 The next German assault, launched by the Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, ran into an ambush in the town centre. Some Tiger tanks and a Panzer IV were disabled by a combination of anti-tank guns, a Sherman Firefly and infantry.103 The damaged German tanks were later set on fire, and British and German infantry clashed throughout the afternoon. British positions were subjected to heavy artillery fire, while several German attacks were repulsed by artillery firing over open sights.104105 One British company was overwhelmed and a platoon taken captive, and the battalion headquarters came under increasing fire.106
Brigadier Hinde decided that the British position was becoming untenable and that his brigade group should be withdrawn until the morning to Point 174, an area of high ground to the west of Villers-Bocage near Amay&lt;U+00E9&gt;-sur-Seulles.107 At 20:00 the withdrawal began under cover of artillery fire, and was accomplished largely unmolested.108
14 June
On the morning of 14 June Montgomery abandoned the idea of a pincer attack on Caen, as he lacked &quot;sufficient strength to act offensively on both flanks&quot;. He proposed that XXX Corps should continue its offensive alone in a &quot;concentrated single blow&quot;; the activity of the 51st (Highland) Division on the eastern flank was &quot;piped down&quot;.109
The 50th (Northumbrian) Division, supported by its entire divisional artillery and the Royal Air Force,110 launched a two-brigade attack to capture the villages of la Senaudi&lt;U+00E8&gt;re, la Belle Epine, Ling&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres and Verri&lt;U+00E8&gt;res.111112 Dependant on the success of these offensives, a further attack would then be mounted to capture the village of Hottot-les-Bagues.113 To prepare the way, a reconnaissance in force was mounted the preceding evening; the panzergrenadiers of the Panzerlehrdivision inflicted heavy losses upon the British. Panzerlehr's losses are unknown, although one tank was confirmed destroyed.114
The main assault began at 10:15 the next morning when the 151st (Durham) Infantry Brigade,115 supported by tanks of the 4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards,116 advanced towards Ling&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres and Verri&lt;U+00E8&gt;res.117 The German defenders held their fire until the British were less than  away, and it took five hours of fighting before the 6th Durham Light Infantry (DLI), with heavy artillery support, cleared the German front line positions. Two companies were pushed forward and captured Verri&lt;U+00E8&gt;res, which was found to be unoccupied, but further advances were checked by infantry and tanks.118
The 9th DLI were also caught by heavy German machine gun fire and were forced to commit their reserve companies to break through the German front line.119 Between noon and 13:30 the battalion captured Ling&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres and positioned anti-tank guns within the village, although most of these were put out of action by the first German counterattack.120121122 Two Panther tanks were then spotted approaching the village by Sergeant Wilfred Harris, commanding a Sherman Firefly.123124 Harris engaged the first at a range of , destroying it, and disabled the second. While Harris ordered his tank into an alternative firing position, a tank-hunting party led by Major John Mogg, the acting battalion commander, finished the damaged Panther off.125126 Further tank-hunting parties drove off another Panther, a British M4 Sherman was destroyed, and a third Panther knocked out by a Sherman.127128 Three more Panthers responded by moving towards the village; Harris destroyed the lead vehicle before it entered the village and the other two within its bounds, although one did manage to reach the centre of Ling&lt;U+00E8&gt;vres before the crew bailed out.129
After heavy fighting the 231st Infantry Brigade was able to reach all of its objectives by nightfall, and linked up with the 151st Infantry Brigade.130 One officer in the 6th DLI stated that the attack was the most successful carried out by the battalion during the course of the operation; in all nine German tanks were knocked out during the course of the day, although the DLI had suffered up to 353 casualties.131132 Nonetheless the division had been unable to break through the Panzerlehr's defences.133
Battle of the brigade box
With the British withdrawal from Villers-Bocage complete, on 14 June the group formed an all round defensive position; a &quot;brigade box&quot;. The exact location of this position is disputed by historians. Carlo D'Este states it was between Amay&lt;U+00E9&gt;-sur-Seulles and Tracy-Bocage, around Hill 174.134 Dan Taylor locates the box around the brigade's tactical headquarters positioned on Hill 174, and presents a map showing the brigade mostly to the south of the village of Amay&lt;U+00E9&gt;-sur-Seulles.135 George Forty places the box to the north of Tracy-Bocage, around the hamlet of St-Germain,136 and draws on a report by the 22nd Armoured Brigade group's commanding officer who states the position was east of Amay&lt;U+00E9&gt;-sur-Seulles and included St-Germain.137 The fighting that followed on 14 June is known by two names: 'The Battle of the Brigade Box'138 and 'The Battle of the Island Position',139 the latter deriving from the 22nd Armoured Brigade's after action report, which referred to the box as the Island Position.140 Forty and Taylor agree that the box was less than  in area.141142
The Panzerlehrdivision had repositioned so that it was able to both defend against the renewed assaults by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and attack the 7th Armoured Division's penetration;143 attacks that would be supported by the 1st Company, Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101.144 The 2nd Panzer Division's reconnaissance battalion, with other small infantry units, had also arrayed to face the brigade box, although the division's panzer regiment would play no part in the battle as it had yet to reach the front.145146
By now the 131st Infantry Brigade, comprised of an infantry battalion and armoured regiment, had moved up to Livry;147 throughout the morning of 14 June the 131st Brigade kept open the road from the brigade box to the Livry–Briquessarrd area,148 while Hawker Typhoon fighter bombers launched attacks against German positions near the box. German infantry spotted moving towards the British lines were subjected to heavy allied artillery fire, breaking up their initial attack, but around 09:00 more infantry closed in on the Brigade box. Too close this time for artillery concentrations to be called in, fighting erupted with a British platoon being overrun. A counterattack with tanks and infantry repelled the Germans and restored the integrity of the position, but the Germans then subjected the British to harassing sniping fire, mortar bombardments, and at 14:00 heavy artillery fire.149 At 19:00 a major two-pronged assault, supported by a long artillery bombardment and tanks, struck the brigade box from the north and south.150151152 This penetrated the British lines and closed in on the brigade headquarters before being driven back, with fighting dying down around 22:30.153
Although confident the position could be held, the inability of 50th Northumbrian to break through Panzerlehr and relieve the 7th Armoured Division prompted the decision to withdraw the brigade group and straighten the front line.154155 The withdrawal, codenamed Operation Aniseed, began just after midnight.156157 Noise cover was provided by an RAF bombing raid on Aunay-sur-Odon and Evrecy that destroyed one Tiger tank and put a further three out of action, inflicting 29 casualties.158159 Harassing artillery fire was directed to the north and south of the withdrawal route, but the Germans did little to intervene.160
An estimated 700–800 casualties were inflicted upon the Germans during the battle, and between eight and 20 tanks destroyed including several Tigers.161162163 British casualties were reported as light, including the loss of only three tanks.164 Michael Reynolds disputes the reported German casualty figures, calling them &quot;exaggerated&quot;. Brigadier Hinde, in his official after-action report, wrote &quot;It is questionable whether the expenditure of artillery and small arms ammunition was justified by the scale of the enemy's efforts&quot;.165
Aftermath
 Over the following days fighting went back and forth between 50th Northumbrian and Panzerlehr.166 By 15 June XXX Corps claimed to have destroyed at least 70 German tanks,167 and on 18 June British infantry once again entered Tilly-sur-Seulles. The town was secured the following day against light opposition;168 it had changed hands 23 times before its final liberation.169
The same day an attack was launched towards Hottot-les-Bagues. Facing determined resistance from Panzerlehr, British infantry gained a foothold in the village but were soon forced out by German counterattacks supported by tanks. The British succeeded in retaking the village and holding it against further German assaults, but with insufficient numbers to secure their position they withdrew during the night, and Hottot-les-Bagues was reoccupied by panzergrenadiers.170
The 7th Armoured Division was pulled back to be bolstered by the 33rd Armoured Brigade,171 which was in the process of landing and forming up within the British beachhead.172 It was planned that the reinforced division would renew its assault,173 but on 19 June a severe storm descended upon the English Channel causing widespread disruption to the over-the-beach supply operations, and further offensives were abandoned.174
Analysis
 Whose idea it was to outflank the Panzerlehrdivision through the gap in the German lines has proved difficult to establish. Historian George Forty states that &quot;although it was clearly Monty's final decision to send the 'Desert Rats' right flanking, it is not entirely clear whose idea it actually was to undertake the 'right hook'.&quot; Forty then quotes 7th Armoured Division commander George Erskine, who claims both that the idea originated with him, and that he believes the manoeuvre could have been conducted 24 hours earlier.175 That the flanking move could have been launched earlier is supported by John Buckley.176 Dan Taylor goes further, suggesting that although Gerard Bucknall of XXX Corps knew about the gap for 24 hours, he was restrained from exploiting it by Second Army commander Miles Dempsey, who was still focused at that time on Operation Wild Oats.177 The official campaign historian, L.F. Ellis, states that Bucknall orchestrated the move but only after consulting with Dempsey.178 Historian Carlo D'Este writes &quot;while the idea had most certainly been under consideration at 30 Corps, the problem was that Bucknall had done absolutely nothing to implement it until Dempsey arrived on the scene... [and] spurred the corps commander to action&quot;.179 Consensus opinion among historians appears to support Dempsey as the instigator, both in developing the plan for the right hook and ordering its execution.180181182183
The failure of the operation led Dempsey to write shortly afterwards that there was &quot;no chance now of a snap operation with airborne troops either to seize Caen or to deepen the bridgehead on XXX Corps front. It is clear now that Caen can be taken only by set-piece assault and we do not have the men or ammunition for that at this time&quot;.184 After the war he remarked &quot;this attack by 7th Armoured Division should have succeeded. My feeling that Bucknall and Erskine would have to go started with that failure ... the whole handling of that battle was a disgrace. Their decision to withdraw [from Villers-Bocage] was done by the corps commander and Erskine.&quot;185 Although D'Este calls Dempsey's comments &quot;excessively harsh&quot;,186 historians generally support them, suggesting that a great opportunity to swiftly capture Caen was squandered by Bucknall.187188189 Fully supporting Dempsey, John Buckley claims that Bucknell was unprepared to support the attack once problems developed, and that Erskine was not suited to the task at hand.190 Major Ellis is somewhat less critical, calling the immediate result of the fighting &quot;disappointing&quot; but stating that with Panzerlehr's stubborn resistance and the unexpected arrival of the 2nd Panzer Division, the 7th Armoured Division &quot;could hardly have achieved full success&quot;.191 However this view is refuted by Michael Reynolds, who notes &quot;2nd Panzer's tanks were nowhere near Villers-Bocage at this time&quot;.192
One reason given for the operation's failure is that insufficient infantry were allotted to the offensive. Michael Reynolds notes that two infantry battalions and most of the 7th Armoured Division's 1st Rifle Brigade were uncommitted to action throughout 13 June. He further identifies three unemployed infantry brigades that could have been committed to the right hook alongside 7th Armoured when it went into action; he blames Bucknall for failing to concentrate enough force at the right place and the right time.193 This analysis is supported by D'Este, although Bucknall defended his decision claiming &quot;49 [Division] ... [had] no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle, and not bundle them helter-skelter into hot armoured scrapping like that around V[illers]-B[ocage] and Amaye.&quot;194 According to John Buckley, the most crucial factor in the operation's failure was a corresponding failure at the command level.195
Chester Wilmot casts a different light on the result of Operation Perch, calling it a strategic success. &quot;By the premature commitment of his armour, Rommel had delayed the British advance, but in the process he had played into Montgomery's hands for, once the panzer divisions were locked into battle with Second Army, they could not be used for their proper offensive task.&quot;196
