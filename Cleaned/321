The Yale School of Medicine at Yale University is a private medical school located in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S. It was founded in 1810 as The Medical Institution of Yale College, and formally opened its doors in 1813.
The primary teaching hospital for the school is Yale-New Haven Hospital. The school is home to the Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, one of the largest modern medical libraries, also known for its historical collections. The faculty includes 25 National Academy of Sciences members and 24 Institute of Medicine investigators.1
Education
The School of Medicine offers a medical degree (M.D.) and a physician associate (PA) degree (M.M.S.). Public Health degrees are administered through the Yale School of Public Health. There are also joint degree programs with other disciplines at Yale including law (M.D/J.D.), business (M.D./M.B.A.), public health (M.D/M.P.H.) and science/engineering (M.D./Ph.D.). Students pursuing a tuition-free fifth year of research are eligible for the Master of Health Science degree. There is a joint program in divinity (M.D./M.Div).
The M.D. program is notable for its assessment of student achievement. In particular, the school employs the so-called &quot;Yale System&quot;, established by Dean Winternitz in the 1920s, wherein first- and second-year students are not graded or ranked among their classmates. In addition, course examinations are anonymous, and are intended only for students' self-evaluation. Student performance is thus based on seminar participation, clinical clerkship evaluations, and the USMLE. Prior to graduation, students are required to submit a thesis based on original research.
History
In 18th century America, credentials were not needed to practice medicine. Prior to the founding of the medical school, Yale graduates would train through an apprenticeship in order to become physicians. Yale president Ezra Stiles conceived the idea of training physicians at Yale and ultimately, his successor Timothy Dwight IV helped to found the medical school. The school was chartered in 1810 and opened in New Haven in 1813. Nathan Smith (medicine and surgery) and Benjamin Silliman (pharmacology) were the first faculty members. Silliman was a professor of chemistry and taught at both Yale College and the Medical School. The other two founding faculty were Jonathan Knight, anatomy, physiology and surgery and Eli Ives, pediatrics.2
The original building (at Grove and Prospect) later became Sheffield Hall, part of the Sheffield Scientific School (razed in 1931). In 1860, the school moved to Medical Hall on York Street, near Chapel (this building was razed in 1957). In 1925, the school moved to its current campus, neighboring the hospital. This campus includes the Sterling Hall of Medicine, Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine (1991, designed by Cesar Pelli), Anlyan Center (2003, designed by Payette and Venturi Scott Brown) and the Amistad Building (2007, designed by Herbert Newman).
