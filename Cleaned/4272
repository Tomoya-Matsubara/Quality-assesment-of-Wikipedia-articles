The Jirau Dam is a hydroelectric dam currently under construction on the Madeira River in the state of Rond&lt;U+00F4&gt;nia, Brazil.
The dam is part of a planned four power plant Madeira river hydroelectric complex, which will consist of two dams in Brazil (3150 MW Santo Antonio Dam at the city of Porto Velho and 3300 MW Jirau about 100 km upstream), a third on the border of Brazil and Bolivia, and a forth station inside Bolivia. Two of these, Santo Antonio and Jirau, are currently under construction, while the smaller upstream dams are still in the planning stages. In part due to the 2001-2002 power shortage in Brazil, construction of both dams was accelerated in 2009, and now Santo Antonio is scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2011, and Jirau will go on-stream one year later in 2012. The total estimated cost of the two facilities currently under construction is $15.6 billion ($8 billion for Jirau), including about $10 billion for the civil engineering and power plants, and $5 billion for ship locks, transmission lines, and environmental re-mediation.1 Construction on the project was halted in March 2011 due to worker riots.
Design
The Jirau Dam will be a combination embankment dam with concrete sections for the power stations and spillway. The length of the entire dam will be  while the embankment section will be . The embankment dam will be arched,  tall and will have an asphalt-core. It's structural volume will be  of which  will be asphalt. The dam's spillway will consist of 21 gates and will have a maximum discharge of . The dam's power station will contain 44 x 75 MW Kaplan bulb turbines for a total installed capacity of 3,300 MW. The reservoir created by the dam will have a surface area of  of which  is the original riverbed.234 Bulb turbines are similar to a Kaplan turbine, except that Bulb turbines are installed horizontally so that power can be recovered from both the hydrostatic head and from the kinetic energy of the incoming water. The power plant is being constructed by the French utility GDF Suez SA and Brazilian company Camargo Correa SA.
Impacts
Social
Brazilian law requires water impoundments to undergo a very thorough approval process to ensure that each project meets environmental, social, political, and safety criteria. However, critics of the Jirau and Santo Antonio dam claim that many legal criteria were rubber-stamped before all questions from impacted groups had been addressed.5 The most frequent objection is that the dam builders failed to adequately consult with indigenous peoples, as required by law. However, environmental groups have also raised concerns about the design of the complex.
The Brazilian government indigenous protection foundation FUNAI predicts that there may be un-contacted indigenous populations in the region that will be affected by the Madeira complex, particularly near the Jirau dam.
Environmental
Because both the Jirau and Santo Antonio dams are run of the river projects, neither dam impounds a large reservoir. As a consequence, there has not been strong environmental opposition to the implementation of the Madeira river complex.6
Labor
Construction on the dam was halted on March 18, 2011 as workers rioted; setting fire to buses and destroying part of the worker housing. Wages and the treatment by security officials was attributed to the rioting. Additional security personal had to be sent to the site and construction was halted.7
Opportunities for Bolivia
Bolivia has been a landlocked country since it lost its coastline to Chile in the war of the pacific in 1994. Many Bolivians feel a deep and lasting bitterness due to this loss, and the Bolivian military continues to build and maintain an open ocean navy in Lake Titicaca, awaiting an eventual recovery of access to the sea. The Madeira River complex presents an opportunity for Bolivia because all of the hydroelectric dams would feature ship locks capable of raising and lowering ocean-going vessels. Hence, if the project is completed, both Bolivian commercial vessels and the Bolivian navy would have access to the open ocean, and lucrative sea lanes, for the first time in 120 years.
