&quot;You Can't Run From Love&quot; is a 1983 single by Eddie Rabbitt. Composed by Rabbitt, along with David Malloy and Even Stevens, &quot;You Can't Run From Love&quot; was the second single released off of his Radio Romance album, after the success of his duet with Crystal Gayle, &quot;You and I&quot;. (Coincidentally, a Crystal Gayle solo recording, &quot;Our Love is On a Faultline&quot;, preceded &quot;You Can't Run From Love&quot; in the #1 position.) It would be Eddie Rabbitt's twelfth number one single on the country chart. The single went to number one for one week and spent a total of thirteen weeks on the country chart 1.
