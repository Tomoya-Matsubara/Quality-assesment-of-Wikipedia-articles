 HDMS Lolland or Laaland was launched in March 1810. She served in at least four major engagements during the Gunboat War before she was transferred to the Norwegian navy after the Treaty of Kiel brought about the separation of Norway from Denmark in 1814. Lolland continued to serve with the Norwegian Navy until sold in 1847. 
Dano-Norwegian navy
For three months from 9 June 1810, Lolland served as a training ship for naval cadets at Copenhagen naval base. At the time she was under the command of Senior Lieutenant later Captain Holger Johan Bahnsen.Topse-Jensen, Vol 1, p.56. Also on board was Senior Lieutenant Georg Joachim Grodtschilling, a mathematics teacher at the naval academy.Topse-Jensen, Vol 1, pp.481-2.Georg Grodtschilling was killed aboard HDMS Najaden 1811  Najaden at the Battle of Lyngr in 1812. 
;1811
On 6 March 1811, Lolland sailed to her new station as part of the naval defences of southern Norway, where she was the command ship for a division of brigs. The year would be a tumultuous one for Lolland as she would engage in three actions against British warships under her new captain, Hans Peter Holm 1772 - 1812 Hans Peter Holm.Topse-Jensen, Vol. 1. pp. 598-601
By the 1 May 1811, Lolland had returned to the southern approaches to Egersund SW Norway with four other brigs,Topse-Jensen, Vol 1, p.599Wandell 1915, p.368. unknown to the British.O'Bryne 1849, p.274. The British sent four boats from HMS Belette 1806 6, HMS Cherokee 1808 6 and HMS Clio 1806 6,Marshall 1835, Vol. 4, Part 2, p.14. into the western end of the sound, expecting to capture some shipping or do other mischief. The circumstances of locality and wind did not permit the Danish brigs to enter the sound from the further end, but Holm sent the Danish ships boats under Lieutenant Niels Gerhardt Langemach Topse-Jensen, Vol 2, p.68. to oppose the British. Some of the  Danes landed to set an ambush from the cliff tops, whilst the armed boats were hidden behind a skerry. As the British rowed boldly in, they met unexpected fire from howitzers and muskets; they immediately withdrew, with the Danish boats in pursuit. The Danes captured one of the British boats and her crew of an officer and 17 men, who had come from Belette, and would have captured more but for the confusion that the explosion of a powder keg on one of the Danish boats caused. This enabled the remaining British boats to reach the protection of their squadron.
On 31 July 1811, Lolland, in company with the brigs Lougen and Kiel, encountered HMS Brev Drageren 1807 6 and HMS Algerine 1810 6 cruising together in Long Sound, Norway.#tag:ref James reports that the three Danish vessels were the 20-gun HDMS Langeland 1808 Langeland, the 18-gun Lgum, and the 16-gun Kiel. However, there are no Danish records of any vessel with the name Lgum, or anything like it, and one can infer from a biography of the captain of Langeland that she was not present at the action. group=Note The Danes had 54 guns and 480 men, against the British 22 guns and 107 men.The Naval Chronicle gives the Danish strength as 60 guns all long 18-pounders, and 550 men. Outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight.Naval Chronicle Vol. 26 Jul-Dec 1811, pp.284-6. 
The next day Brev Drageren unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and Brev Drageren also had three wounded. In the second days fight, Algerine sent a boat and sweeps to Brev Drageren, which helped her escape the Danes, though not until after her crew had rowed for 30 hours.James 1837, Vol. 5, p.346. Lolland captured two cargo ships galleases that Brev Drageren had been escorting.Wandell 1915, p.369.
On 17 August 1811 HMS Manly 1804 6 sailed from Sheerness with a convoy for the Baltic Sea Baltic under Lieutenant Richard William Simmonds. On 2 September 1811, off Randerne, some 30 miles SE of Arendal on the Norwegian coast in company with HMS  Chanticleer 1808 6 they encountered three Danish 18-gun-brigs: Lolland, Alsen Senior Lieutenant M. Ltken, and Sams Senior Lieutenant Ridder F. Grodtschilling.
The Danish brigs were sailing westward along the coast when they sighted the two strange vessels, which by their night signals appeared to be enemy.Danish source. http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~anders/books/Fra_Krigens_Tid/Allart.html The Danes set out in pursuit, with Sams, which was closest, sailing for the nearer of the enemy vessels, Alsen and Lolland following. However, their quarry - the Chanticleer turned south-east, and Sams and Alsen followed. Lolland then set off after the second ship, the Manly. 
By 0340hrs Lolland had caught up with Manly. Combat began at 0445hrs and at 0540hrs Lolland succeeded in crossing behind her quarry, which then striking the colours struck at 0555hrs. Lolland sent a prize crew over that brought back Lieutenant Simmonds, of Manly. In rough seas, neither Alsen nor Samse could catch HMS Chanticleer and so gave up the chase.
Lolland had lost one man killed but had had no wounded; neither of the other two Danish vessels had sustained any casualties. Lolland had slight damage to her rigging and sails, but none to her hull; the other two Danish vessels reported negligible damage. The Danes took Manly into service, retaining her name and armament.Orlogsmusset Naval Museumhttp://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/M/pages/The%20Manly%281811%29.htm Later that year, Captain Anthonius Krieger replaced Holm as captain of Lolland.Topse-Jensen, Vol. 2, pp. 38-9.
;1812
In 1812, the Danish-Norwegian naval forces based in Norway were utilizing a sheltered but weakly defended anchorage at Sandoya. The Dano-Norwegian force consisted of the frigate HDMS Najaden 1811 Najaden, three brigs - Lolland, Kiel under the command of Otto Frederick Rasch,Translated from the Danish website http://runeberg.org/dbl/13/0489.html. 'and Samse - as well as a number of gunboats. The British saw an opportunity to break the back of Dano-Norwegian seapower and sent the 64-gun Third-rate Third Rate ship-of-the-line HMS Dictator 1783 2 and three brigs, the 18-gun Cruizer class brig-sloop HMS Calypso 1805 2, 14-gun brig-sloop HMS Podargus 1808 2 and the 14-gun gun brig HMS Flamer 1804 2 to seek out the Danes.
The encounter took place on 6 July 1812 at Lyngr.
main Battle of Lyngr
The British sank Najaden and took Lolland and Kiel as prizes. However the British had to abandon their prizes after the two vessels grounded. The British did not set fire to either as they still had their crews and wounded aboard.London Gazette issue=16623 date=14 July 1812 startpage=1361 endpage=1364 The action cost the British nine men killed, 26 wounded, and two missing. Overall, the Danes acknowledged losing 300 men killed or wounded. 
;1813
In late December 1813 the three ships Lolland, HMS Seagull 1805 The Seagull and Samse sailed to Frederikshavn Frederickshavn, Jutland to escort a convoy of some 45 vessels carrying much-needed grain to Norway. They succeeded in their mission, although they lost one of the grain ships to a Swedish privateer. During the mission, a storm forced Samse to seek shelter in Danish waters; as a result, at the separation of Norway from Denmark, Samse remained with the Danish navy,The Norwegian Navy 1814until 1819Record Card for http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/S/pages/Sams%F81808.htm Samse

The separation from Denmark left Norway with a severely depleted cadre of naval officers and six active-duty brigs, of which Lolland was the largest:A seventh brig, HDMS Lougen 1805 Lougen was by this time laid up.

Budde took command of Lolland in May 1814. At this time Lolland became the command ship of the Norwegian navys brig squadron.  The brigs Lolland, Seagull, Alsen og Kiel had sailed  to Frederickhavn to escort a large convoy of some 80 much-needed grain ships from Denmark to Norway. In the Skagerak two Swedish frigates, the Eurydice 44 and the af Chapman 36, tried to capture the convoy and its escorts but the Eurydice was too far way to be effective. The four Norwegian brigs, under orders not to fire unless first fired on, boxed in the af Chapman until the supply vessels successfully reached Norwegian waters.
Scandinavian politics of 1814 starting with the unsuccessful Treaty of Kiel, the declaration of Norwegian independance, and the attempt by Sweden to recover its sovereignty by force, led to a truce at the Convention of Moss on 14 August 1814.  All units of the small Norwegian fleet remained on their respective stations until mid-October of that year, when they were ordered to be laid up.
Fate
Lolland received a major refit in 1831. She was sold in 1847.
