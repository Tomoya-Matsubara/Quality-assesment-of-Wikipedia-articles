Commonwealth Securities is Australia's largest discount stockbroking firm operated by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, one of Australia's top four banks. The brokerage arm started operations in 1995 and launched its share trading website in 1997.12
Commonwealth Securities, also known as &quot;CommSec&quot; or &quot;ComSec&quot;, has been highly successful as a discount broker attracting many &quot;mums and dads&quot; (retail) investors. It offers a telephone based brokerage service and advisory service, though its Internet trading platform constitutes the vast majority of its business.3
CommSec initially offered only Australian equities trades, but has since expanded into derivative products, international equities, managed funds, Self Managed Super Fund administration, Contracts-For-Difference and margin lending. The firm's large retail customer base has also allowed it to successfully market a number of initial public offering (IPO) fund raisings.
While standard CommSec traders use the static website, frequent equities and options traders use one of the realtime trading platforms. CommSecIRESS is a web-based solution being developed by Iress Market Technology (ASX:IRE)) and based on the Java runtime environment, while the software, stand-alone platform Professional Trader or ProTrader runs on Microsoft's .NET framework. These platforms combine all the features of the website, while adding more advanced features and streaming live data from the Australian Securities Exchange.
In 2008 CommSec became the first Australian brokerage firm to offer a brokerage website specifically designed for a portable-device.4 It created CommSec iPhone Edition for the Apple iPhone, the first home-grown iPhone application in Australia.
Mergers and Acquisitions
CommSec has retained and increased its significant marketshare in retail broking through both CBA's acquisition of other banks and its own acquisition of other broking firms5. CommSec now performs broking operations for Colonial First State6, TD Waterhouse7, AOT89, Neville Ward Direct1011, Auckland Savings Bank (ASB)12, and IWL (Westpac Broking, Sanford and Avcol)13. The addition of IWL gave CommSec significant market share in wholesale broking to compliment its existing retail presence14.
Cash Management
In 2008 CommSec diversified into the short term deposit sector with the introduction of its Cash Management product.15 The product consists of two distinct accounts the CommSec Cash Account (CCA) and the CommSec Investment Account (CIA). The CCA is designed to both be the source of funds for stock trading and also an everday transaction account, with a linked debit MasterCard. The CIA is designed as a high interest cash deposit distinguished by its lack of tiers and that cash can only be transfered to and from the CCA.
