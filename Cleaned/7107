Naskapi (also known as Innu Aimuun, Iyuw Imuun) is an Algonquian language spoken by the Naskapi in Quebec and Labrador, Canada.1 It is written in Eastern Cree syllabics.
The term Naskapi is not really appropriate when talking about language as it assumes a very close linguistic relationship between Kawawachikamach (Western, or Koksoak) and Natuashish (Eastern, Mushuau Innu, or Davis Inlet dialect) which doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t exist. Kawawachikamach Naskapi is a y-dialect and dialectically belongs with East Cree, except that its orthography is significantly different.
