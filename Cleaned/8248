Loyola is a census-designated place and an unincorporated town in Santa Clara County, California, United States. The population was 3,478 at the 2000 census. The area is located between the cities of Los Altos and Los Altos Hills. While Loyola is unfamiliar to locals, an adjoining business district in Los Altos is called Loyola Corners.
The name comes from a 1904 plan by the Jesuits of Santa Clara University to build a new university named for their founder, St. Ignatius of Loyola, in the area. If the plan had come to fruition, the university would have been located in the area of the present-day golf course on Country Club Drive. The Los Altos project succumbed to delays and financing problems stemming from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.12
