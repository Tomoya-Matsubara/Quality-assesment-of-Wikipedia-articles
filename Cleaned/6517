Reception in the United States
Aaron Coleman of Back Stage found &quot;copying its American counterparts&quot; made the film &quot;warmly endearing&quot;.3
Farran Smith Nehme New York Post felt the plot was predictable and added &quot;even the camera work is predictable&quot;.4
Calhoun Kersten of www.filmmonthly.com called this film &quot;so disarmingly charming that its faults don&lt;U+2019&gt;t stop it from being an incredibly enjoyable film&quot;, no matter whether &quot;you feel like you&lt;U+2019&gt;ve seen it all before&quot;.5
Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter judged that despite &quot;its slavish adherence to familiar genre conventions&quot; the film provided &quot;reasonably fun viewing&quot; because of its &quot;off-kilter humor&quot; and the &quot;chemistry exhibited by Schweighofer and Kekilli&quot;.6
Sandrine Sahakians of www.filmequals.com recommended the film to &quot;anyone looking to put a smile on their faces&quot;.7
Andy Webster of the New York Times conceded What a Man possibly quoted some well-known patterns but added &quot;its sureness of tone&quot; made Schweigh&lt;U+00F6&gt;fer &quot;a talent to watch&quot;.8
