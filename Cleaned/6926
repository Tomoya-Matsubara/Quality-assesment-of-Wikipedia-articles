 This is a list of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons in English and European football, from 1903—when the club was formed—to the 2006–07 season. It details the club's achievements in senior league and cup competitions, European competitions and the top scorers for each season. The list of top scorers also chronicles how the club's scoring records have progressed throughout the club's history.
Bradford City were formed in 1903 and was elected into Division Two before it had even played a game. Bradford City and Chelsea, in 1905, remain the only teams to be elected into the league before playing a competitive fixture.1 The club was promoted to Division One when it won the Division Two title in 1907–08. In 1910–11 the club recorded its highest league position of fifth and also won its only major honour when captain Jimmy Speirs lifted the FA Cup after he scored the only goal to defeat Newcastle United 1–0 in the final replay.2 Bradford City's honours also include the Division Three (North) title in 1928–29 and Division Three crown in 1984–85, as well as the Third Division North Challenge Cup in 1938–39.
The club has spent two seasons in the Premier League. In 1999–2000, it avoided relegation with just 36 points, then a record low to stay up, after defeating Liverpool 1–0 in the final game with a headed goal from David Wetherall.3 The club has won promotion in a total of eight seasons and been relegated on ten occasions; three relegations in the previous seven seasons meant the 2007–08 season would be its first in the fourth tier in 26 years. The Bantams have also played in European competition when they took one of England's two places in the Intertoto Cup in 2000. Bradford defeated FK Atlantas and RKC Waalwijk before being knocked out by FC Zenit Saint Petersburg in the semi-finals.4
