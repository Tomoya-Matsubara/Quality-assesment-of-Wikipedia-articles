Philip Anthony Charnock (born 14 February 1975 in Southport) is an English former footballer.
Playing career
Charnock began his career with Liverpool, and made his debut in 1992 in a Cup Winners' Cup game against Apollon Limassol. Charnock was just 17 years and 9 months old, which made him the youngest player ever to play for the club in European competition, breaking a record previously set by Jamie Redknapp one year earlier. Despite this promising start, Charnock did not break into the first team at Anfield, instead he spent much of his time in the reserves and never appeared for the first time team again.1 With the advent of squad numbers in the Premier League from the 1993&lt;U+2013&gt;94 season onwards, Charnock was issued with the number 18 shirt &lt;U+2013&gt; next worn by Michael Owen, who went on to be one of the club's most highly regarded players ever.2
In 1996 he left for Crewe Alexandra, following a successful loan spell. He spent six largely successful years at the Alex, playing in the third and second tiers, but his time was blighted by injury.
He was released by Crewe Alexandra in April 2002, after manager Dario Gradi informed him he did not feature in his first team plans.3 He moved on to nearby Port Vale,4 but was released a year later.5 He also had a brief spell with Bury,6 before moving to Northern Ireland to play for Linfield.7 In October 2005 he joined Ballymena United on a short-term contract,8 which was extended after some good performances.9 He suffered with injury at both Irish clubs,1011 missing a whole year of action,12 and he returned to England in summer 2006, joining Fleetwood Town. A year later, Charnock signed for Conference North team Leigh RMI. He signed for Mossley in July 2008.13
