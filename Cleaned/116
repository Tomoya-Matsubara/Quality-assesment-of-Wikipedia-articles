The Hangzhou Wahaha Group Co., Ltd. (&lt;U+676D&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+5A03&gt;&lt;U+54C8&gt;&lt;U+54C8&gt;&lt;U+96C6&gt;&lt;U+56E2&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&lt;U+9650&gt;&lt;U+516C&gt;&lt;U+53F8&gt;) (&quot;WHH&quot;) is a private group of companies, and the largest beverage producer in China.1 The company is headquartered in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province. &quot;Wa ha ha&quot; signifies &quot;laughing child&quot;.
Wahaha has roughly 70 subsidiary companies and 40 manufacturing bases scattered throughout China. Wahaha employs about 10,000 staff.2
The company was originally a local government owned sales company founded in 1987-8. For most of the time since creation, it has been run by Zong Qinghou (&lt;U+5B97&gt;&lt;U+6176&gt;&lt;U+5F8C&gt;), who exercises operational control over the day to day operations.
Products and distribution
Wahaha branded products include milk drinks (19%), soft drinks, bottled water (43%), bottled tea (19%), fruit juice (13%), porridges and its flagship yoghurt beverages (7%).3
Its largest facility is located in Hangzhou's Xiasha Economic and Technological Development Zone, where one-third of the company's production occurs.4
Wahaha dealers help them with management and marketing and advertises nationally. The company has 35 provincial sales offices, 2,500 sales team employees, Its distribution is truly nation-wide. Wahaha is one of 3 brands which has few distribution gaps in rural China, with more than 2 million sales outlets across the country.5 Distributors are responsible for capital, storage, and delivery. The company maintains two grades of distributors: more than 1,500 first-level dealers that need to meet distribution targets and manage large networks and capital; and 12,000 second-level dealers that deal at smaller levels.6 Distributors' franchise areas are strictly delimited to ensure no poaching between areas, and are guaranteed by forfeitable deposits lodged with Wahaha.
The distribution has given &quot;Future Cola&quot; a close third in national market share through its domination of rural China, its tertiary and secondary cities. According to PRC government statistics, Coca Cola held a 24 percent market share in 2003,7 whilst Future Cola's market share is 70% of that of Pepsi.
Its products are also available in major Chinatowns.
History
Wahaha had its origins as the sales department of the Shangcheng District School in Hangzhou, created in 1987. The factory, the &quot;Hangzhou Wahaha Nutritional Foods Factory&quot; (&lt;U+676D&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+5A03&gt;&lt;U+54C8&gt;&lt;U+54C8&gt;&lt;U+71DF&gt;&lt;U+990A&gt;&lt;U+98DF&gt;&lt;U+54C1&gt;&lt;U+5EE0&gt;), was created in 1989 to tap a niche in the market for a &quot;children's liquid nutrient&quot; &lt;U+5152&gt;&lt;U+7AE5&gt;&lt;U+71DF&gt;&lt;U+990A&gt;&lt;U+53E3&gt;&lt;U+670D&gt;&lt;U+6DB2&gt;.8 Although there were 38 producers of liquid nutrients on the market, none were specifically for children. The advertising campaign struck a note with single child Chinese parents, and was a runaway success.9 In 1991, the factory was merged with the ailing &quot;Hangzhou Canned Food Factory&quot; (&lt;U+676D&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+7F50&gt;&lt;U+5934&gt;&lt;U+98DF&gt;&lt;U+54C1&gt;&lt;U+5382&gt;) in a social restructuring, but which increased the overheads of the business.10
In May 1992, Wahaha raised CNY236 million internally in order to start the Hangzhou Wahaha Food City Co. Ltd. (&lt;U+676D&gt;&lt;U+5DDE&gt;&lt;U+5A03&gt;&lt;U+54C8&gt;&lt;U+54C8&gt;&lt;U+7F8E&gt;&lt;U+98DF&gt;&lt;U+57CE&gt;&lt;U+80A1&gt;&lt;U+4EFD&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&lt;U+9650&gt;&lt;U+516C&gt;&lt;U+53F8&gt;), and to finance the construction of Wahaha Food City, in Hangzhou.11 Due to inexperience in project management, cashflow became a problem, as construction was delayed for 6 years.12 This company holds the interests of the employees' union. It changed its name to ZHI at an EGM in August 2001.
During the period from 1992 to 1994, WHH would shift the company away from health drinks to other products. It was to launch a sour plum drink, alcoholic beverages, pseudo-medicinal potions, but these would successively fail.13
In 1994, the company took over three insolvent companies in Sichuan, and set up its first factory in Chongqing. A local manufacturing base enabled the company to reduce distribution costs to western China.14 Once talks had started with Danone, capital became available once again for the company. WHH launched Wahaha Pure Water and struck gold with it.15 Over the next three years, WHH would acquire 40 more companies in 22 different provincial cities, transforming it into one of the largest beverage companies in China.
Joint ventures
In 1995, Peregrine Investments Holdings introduced Zong to Danone, and discussions about joint ventures began. The Wahaha trademark was assigned to the main joint venture vehicle on 29 February 1996, and a joint venture agreement was eventually signed on 28 March 1996.16
The &quot;foreign partners&quot; took 51%, while the &quot;Chinese partners&quot; held 49% (of which WHH holds 39% and employees own 10%).17 Groupe Danone and Peregrine together invested US$70 million in return for the stake in five joint venture WHH companies18 with the exclusive rights of production, distribution and sales of products under the Wahaha brand.19 When Peregrine collapsed in 1998, Groupe DANONE acquired its stake in the JVs, and became majority owner.
The business had grown into 39 joint venture entities by 2007,20 and the total injected capital amounts to USD131 million.21
Since April 2007, Wahaha has been engaged in a public dispute with Danone, its JV partner. Danone has accused Zong of selling identical products using the Wahaha brand outside of the joint ventures, and demands a 51% stake in these.22 The matter is ongoing.
Going it alone
Since the dispute began, Wahaha has launched products under different brands. Earlier the company released new beverage products under the name of Nutri-Express Drink and Wahaha Smoothie. U-Yo Milk Coffee has now been launched with a &quot;Qili&quot; logo. The producer was a new company rather than the Wahaha Group. More products are likely to be rebranded with the new logo.23

Other &quot;Wahaha companies&quot;

These companies are the subject of the dispute with the foreign partner. At the end of 2006, total non-joint venture companies reportedly had equity of &lt;U+00A5&gt;5.6 billion and profits of &lt;U+00A5&gt;1.04 billion. In December, Zong had agreed to sell these to Danone for &lt;U+00A5&gt;4 billion.27
