The Almonte Detachment was a military-operated radio communications receiver station linked by land line to CFS Carp located off Lanark Country Road 49 East of Almonte, Ontario. A second antenna reciever site was located further East near Dunrobin, Ontario; the Dunrobin Detachment. The detachment was unmanned and the location primarily used as a remote antenna farm. After the end of the Cold War, CFS Carp was decomissioned and the antenna site was no longer needed.12
