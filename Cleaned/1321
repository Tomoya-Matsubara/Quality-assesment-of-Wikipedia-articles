History
Saline County was formed by European-American settlers on November 25, 1820, and was named after the salt mines found in the region. Historically Saline County was occupied for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of Missouri Native Americans. They were relocated to reservations following European-American settlement.
Saline County was settled primarily by migrants from the Upper Southern states of Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. They quickly started cultivating crops similar to those in Middle Tennessee and Kentucky: hemp and tobacco. The counties settled by southerners were known as &quot;Little Dixie.&quot; By the time of the Civil War, one-third of the county population was African American, most of whom were enslaved laborers on major plantations, particularly for labor-intensive tobacco cultivation.
