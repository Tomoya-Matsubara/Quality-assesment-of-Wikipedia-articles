Tooth squeeze (or squeeze) is a pain experienced by people who undergo rapid changes of pressure. These rapid changes cause air inside a tooth to expand or contract quickly. This air is usually found underneath a filling. The most common victims are SCUBA divers (because in deep dives pressures can increase by several atmospheres) and military pilots (because of rapid changes in unpressurized cabins).
