 The Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex is a recreation facility in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. It is located on Father David Bauer Drive, west of Uptown. The complex contains the Sunlife Arena, a 4,132-seat multi-purpose arena that is home to the Waterloo Siskins and the Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks hockey teams, the Kitchener-Waterloo Kodiaks Major Series Lacrosse team, and the Swimplex, a 30m pool that was the city's first municipally-owned indoor pool.
Construction of the $21 million facility began in December 1991 and the Rec Complex opened in September 1993. While under construction, the site was selected for the 1994 Scott Tournament of Hearts, the Canadian women's curling championship. It was called the Waterloo Recreation Complex until May 2001, when Memorial was added after the city closed the Waterloo Memorial Arena. The building honours the 69 Waterloo residents killed in the two world wars.
