Peter Featherby (born December 12, 1951) is a former Australian rules footballer. He began his senior career with Subiaco Football Club in the West Australian Football League, but is best-known for his time with two Victorian Football League clubs.
Featherby's first stint in the VFL was with the Footscray Football Club, where disagreements with the coaching staff saw him last only two seasons before moving back to
Geelong encouraged him to return to the VFL and they were successful in their persuasion. In 1979 he moved to the club and won the Carji Greeves Medal in 1981. Featherby retired from football in 1983 and was inducted into the WAFL Hall of Fame in 2007.
