The Partitions of Poland or Partitions of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth took place in the second half of the 18th century and ended the existence of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, resulting in the elimination of sovereign Poland for 122 years. The Partition politics partitions were perpetrated by the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Monarchy Habsburg Austria, which divided up the Commonwealth lands among themselves progressively in the process of territorial seizures.Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries.

The First Partition of Poland First Partition of Poland, which was incapable of resisting, was decided on August 5, 1772. Two decades later, Russian and Prussian troops entered Poland again and the Second Partition of Poland Second Partition was signed off on January 23, 1793. Austria did not participate in the Second Partition. The Third Partition of Poland Third Partition took place on October 24, 1795, as soon as the Polish Kociuszko Uprising was defeated. With this partition, the independent state of PolishLithuanian Commonwealth Poland-Lithuania ceased to exist.
The term Partitions of Poland is sometimes used geographically as toponymy, to mean the three parts or provinces that the partitioning powers divided Poland into, i.e.: the Austrian partition, the Prussian partition and the Russian partition. The term #Fourth Partition Fourth Partition of Poland has been used in historiography in reference to any subsequent division of Polish lands. The term Fourth Partition in a temporal sense can also mean the diaspora communities that played important political role in reestablishing the Polish sovereign state after 1918.
 History 
 Prelude 
Image:Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772.PNG 266px thumb right Before the partitions: The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth as a protectorate of Russian Empire in 1772
During the reign of Wadysaw IV Vasa Wadysaw IV 163248, the liberum veto had evolved. This policy of parliamentary procedure was based on the assumption of the political equality of every gentleman, with the corollary that unanimous consent was needed for all measures. A single member of parliament's belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency usually simply his own estate, even after the act had already been approved, became enough to strike the act. It became increasingly difficult to get action taken. The liberum veto also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways, through bribing nobles to exercise it.  Thus, one could characterise Poland-Lithuania in its final period mid-18th century before the partitions as already not a completely sovereign state: it could be seen almost as a vassal state, or in modern terms, a Russian Empire Russian satellite state, with Russian tsars effectively choosing Polish kings. This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King Stanisaw August Poniatowski, who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress Catherine II of Russia Catherine the Great. 
In 1730 the neighbours of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Rzeczpospolita, namely Prussia, Austria and Russia, signed a secret agreement to maintain the status quo: specifically, to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change. Their alliance later became known in Poland as the Alliance of the Three Black Eagles or Lwenwolde's Treaty, because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol in contrast to the white eagle, a symbol of Poland. The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising Kingdom of Prussia, while Prussia was demanding a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions, although this would leave the Commonwealth with a Baltic Sea Baltic coast only in Latvia and Lithuania.  The Commonwealth could never be liquidated unless its longtime ally, Habsburg Monarchy Austria, allowed it,Citation needed date=February 2007 and first Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side.
The Commonwealth had remained neutral in the Seven Years' War, though sympathizing with the alliance of France, Habsburg Monarchy Austria, and Russia, and allowing Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Kingdom of Prussia Prussia. Frederick II of Prussia retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy. Through the szlachta Polish nobles whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw, ambassador and Prince Nicholas Repnin, Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so-called Repnin Sejm of 1767, named after ambassador Repnin, who de facto dictated the terms of that Sejm and who ordered the capture and exile  of some vocal opponents of his policies to Kaluga in Russian Empire.,Hamish M.

Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and Eastern Orthodox Church Orthodox Christians, and the resulting reaction among some of Poland's Roman Catholics, as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealth's domestic affairs, led to the War of the Bar Confederation Confederation of Bar  from 17681772, where the Poles tried to expel Russian forces from Commonwealth territory. The irregular and poorly commanded Polish forces had little chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a major defeat. Adding to the chaos was a Ukraine Ukrainian Cossack and peasant rebellion, the Koliyivschyna, which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of szlachta noblemen szlachta, Jews, Uniates, and Catholic priests before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops.
In 1769 Austria annexed a small territory of Spisz and in 1770 - Nowy Scz and Nowy Targ. These territories had been a bone of contention between Poland and Hungary, which was a part of the Austrian crown lands.
 First Partition 
Main First Partition of Poland

In February, 1772, the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna. Early in August the Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavors of the Confederation of Bar to offer successful resistance;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466910/Partitions-of-Poland  Partitions of Poland. 2008. Encyclopdia Britannica Online. Retrieved June 8, 2011. nonetheless several battles and sieges took place, as Polish troops refused to lay down their arms most notably, in Tyniec, Czstochowa and Krakw.
The partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22, 1772. Frederick II of Prussia was elated with his success; Prussia took most of the Polish Royal Prussia that stood between its possessions in the Kingdom of Prussia and the Margraviate of Brandenburg, taking Ermland Warmia, Royal Prussia without the city of Gdask Danzig Gdask which in 1773 became a new Provinces of Prussia province called West Prussia, northern areas of Greater Poland along the Note River the Netze District, and parts of Kuyavia, also the Prussian city of Toru Thorn Toru. Despite token criticism of the partition from Austrian Empress Maria Theresa of Austria Maria Theresa, Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz was proud of wresting as large a share as he did, with the rich salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka. To Austria fell Zator and Auschwitz Owicim, part of Little Poland embracing parts of the counties of Krakw and Sandomir and the whole of Galicia, less the City of Krakw. Catherine II of Russia Catherine of Russia was also very satisfied. By this diplomatic document Russia came into possession of that section of Livonia that had remained in Commonwealth control, and of Belarus embracing the counties of Vitebsk, Polatsk Polotsk and Mstislavl.

By this partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 30% of its territory, with a population of four million people 1/3 of its population, of which a large portion had not been ethnically Polish. By seizing northwestern Poland, Prussia instantly gained control over 80% of the Commonwealth's total foreign trade. Through levying enormous customs duties, Prussia accelerated the collapse of the Commonwealth.
After having occupied their respective territories, the three partitioning powers demanded that King Stanisaw August Poniatowski Stanisaw and the Sejm approve their action. When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. The so-called Partition Sejm, with Russian military forces threatening the opposition, on September 18, 1773, signed the treaty of cession, renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories.
 Second Partition 
Main Second Partition of Poland
Image:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 2.png thumb 300px After the Second Partition 1793
By 1790, on the political front, the First Polish Republic had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was successfully forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian alliance Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed. The conditions of the Pact contributed greatly to the succeeding and final two partitions of Poland-Lithuania. The Constitution of May 3, 1791 May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established the separation of the three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France, Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.
In the Polish-Russian War of 1792 War in Defense of the Constitution, pro-Russian conservative Polish magnates, the Targowica Confederation Confederation of Targowica, fought against Polish forces supporting the constitution, believing that Russians would help them restore the Golden Liberty. Abandoned by their Prussian allies, Polish pro-constitution forces, faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army, were defeated. Prussia signed a treaty with Russia, agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory. In 1793, deputies to the Grodno Sejm, last Sejm of the Commonwealth, in the presence of the Russian forces, agreed to Russian territorial demands. In the 2nd partition, Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough more land so that only one-third of the 1772 population remained in Poland. Prussia named its newly gained province South Prussia, with Posen and later Warsaw as the capital of the new province.
Targowica confederates, who did not expect another partition, and the king, Stanisaw August Poniatowski, who joined them near the end, both lost much prestige and support. The reformers, on the other hand, were attracting increasing support, and in 1794 the Kociuszko Uprising begun.
 Third Partition 
Main Third Partition of Poland
Kosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of the Russian Empire. The partitioning powers, seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth, decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map. On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty, dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth among their three countries.
The Russian part included 120,000&nbsp;km and 1.2 million people with Vilnius Wilno, the Prussian part new provinces of New East Prussia and New Silesia 55,000&nbsp;km and 1 million people with Warsaw, and the Austrian 47,000&nbsp;km with 1.2 million and Lublin and Krakw.

The King of Poland, Stanisaw August Poniatowski, under Russian military escort left for Grodno where he abdication abdicated on November 25, 1795; next he left for Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he would spend his remaining days. This act ensured that Russia would be seen as the most important of the partitioning powers.

Poland would be briefly resurrectedif in a smaller framein 1807, when Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw. After his defeat and the implementation of the Congress of Vienna treaty in 1815, the Russian-dominated Congress Poland Congress Kingdom of Poland was created in its place. After the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland with Warsaw and, after crushing November Uprising an insurrection in 1831, the Congress Kingdom's autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. After the January Uprising uprising of 1863, Russification of Polish secondary schools was imposed and the literacy rate dropped dramatically. In the Austrian portion, Poles fared better, and were allowed to have representation in Parliament and to form their own universities, and Krakw and Lemberg Lww/Lviv became centers of Polish culture and education. Meanwhile, Prussia Germanisation of Poles during Partitions Germanized the entire school system of its Polish subjects, and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than the Russian Empire. In 1915 a client state of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary was proposed and accepted by the Central Powers of World War I: the Kingdom of Poland 19161918 Regency Kingdom of Poland. After the end of World War I, the Central Powers' surrender to the Allies of World War I Western Allies, the chaos of the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian Revolution and the Treaty of Versailles finally allowed and helped the restoration of Poland's full independence after 123 years.
 Fourth Partition 
The terminology describing the partitions of Poland can be somewhat confusing, as the first three partitions are sometimes used to refer to the three dates on which Poland was divided 1772, 1793, and 1795 and sometimes to the three geographic divisions the German or Prussian partition, Austrian partition, and Russian partition.  The term Fourth Partition has also been used in both a temporal and a spatial sense.  
The term Fourth Partition of Poland may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands, specifically:
 after the Napoleonic Era, the 1815 division of the Duchy of Warsaw at the Congress of Vienna;
 the 1832 incorporation of the Congress Poland Congress Kingdom into Russia, and the 1846 incorporation of the Free City of Krakw Republic of Krakw into Austria; and
 the 1939 division of Poland between Nazi Germany Germany and the Soviet Union pursuant to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.en icon cite book   author =Michael Brecher  coauthors =Jonathan Wilkenfeld   title =A Study of Crisis   year =1997   pages =255   publisher =University of Michigan Press  isbn=0472108069   url =http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0472108069&id=GjY7aV_6FPwC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA254&dq=Zeligowski+state&sig=uzmRepBmlI5W8pFsddP5qXsuBU0
If one accepts more than one of those events as partitions, fifth and sixth partitions can be counted, but these terms are very rare.
The term Fourth Partition was also used in the 19th and 20th centuries to refer to diaspora communities who maintained a close interest in the project of regaining Polish independence.Cygan, Mary. 1998. Inventing Polonia: Notions of Polish American identity, 1870-1990. Prospects 23, pp. 209-246.  Sometimes termed Polonia, these expatriate communities often contributed funding and military support to the project of regaining the Polish nation-state.  Diaspora politics were deeply affected by developments in and around the homeland, and vice versa, for many decades.Lopata, Helena Znaniecka.  1994.  Polish Americans.  New Brunswick, NJ:  Transaction Publishers.
In current politics, the Polish right-wing politics right-wingers occasionally warn of a Fourth Partition that would take place through purchase of the Polish properties by Germans and Jews.http://books.google.com/books?id=olpKYhgrS48C&pg=PA365&dq=Liga+Polskich+Rodzin&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=1970&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=1978&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=
 Historiography 
As historian Norman Davies stated, because the Balance of power in international relations balance of power equilibrium was observed, many contemporary observers accepted explanations of the enlightened apologists of the partitioning state.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland in Two Volumes, Oxford University Press, 2005, ISBN 0199253390, http://books.google.com/books?id=b912JnKpYTkC&pg=RA1-PA283&vq=the+coincidence+of+view&dq=noble+paradise+peasant+hell+purgatory&as_brr=3&sig=Majcm4VX29AJBOcijElu99V9iBA Google Print, p.283 19th century historians from countries that carried out the partitions,  such as 19th century Russian scholar Sergey Solovyov, and their 20th century followers, argued that partitions were justified, as the Commonwealth of Both Nations Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth had degenerated to the point of being partitioned because the counterproductive principle of liberum veto made decision-making on divisive issues, such as a wide-scale social reform, virtually impossible. Solovyov specified the cultural, language and religious break between the supreme and lowest layers of the society in the east regions of the Commonwealth, where the Bielorussian and Ukrainians Ukrainian serf peasantry was Orthodox. Russian authors emphasized the historical connections between Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, as former parts of the medieval old Russian state where dynasty of Rurikids reigned Kievan Rus.E.g., Sergey Solovyov's History of the Downfall of Poland Moscow, 1863. Thus, Nikolay Karamzin wrote: Let the foreigners denounce the partition of Poland: we took what was ours.http://rys-arhipelag.ucoz.ru/publ/6-1-0-133 .. .             Russian historians often stressed that Russia annexed primarily Ukrainian and Belorussian provinces with Eastern Slavic inhabitants,Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, Old Russia, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, American Slavic and East European Review, Vol. 11, No. 3. Oct., 1952, pp. 171-188 although many Ruthenians were no more enthusiastic about Russia than about Poland, and ignoring ethnically Polish and Lithuanian territories also being annexed on a large scale including the annexation of the undeniably Polish capital of Warsaw. A new justification for partitions arose with the Russian Enlightenment, as Russian writers such as Gavrila Derzhavin, Denis Fonvizin, and Alexander Pushkin stressed degeneration of Catholic Poland and the need to civilize it by its neighbors.Andrzej Nowak historian Andrzej Nowak, http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/197/Nowak.html The Russo-Polish Historical Confrontation, The Sarmatian Review, January 1997, Volume XVII, Number 1 
Nonetheless other 19th century contemporaries were much more skeptical; for example, British jurist Sir Robert Phillimore discussed the partition as a violation of international law;Sir Robert Phillimore, Commentaries Upon International Law, 1854

More recent studies claim that partitions happened when the Commonwealth had been showing the beginning signs of a slow recovery and see the last two partitions as an answer to strengthening reforms in the Commonwealth and the potential threat they represented to its neighbours.http://web2.airmail.net/napoleon/polish_army.html The Army of Grand Duchy of WarsawHon.

 Trivia 
The Ottoman Empire was the only country in the world that refused to accept the liquidation of the Republic of Poland as a result of partition and reserved a place in its diplomatic corps for an Ambassador of Lehistan Poland.
The Italian National Anthem contains a reference to the partition.
