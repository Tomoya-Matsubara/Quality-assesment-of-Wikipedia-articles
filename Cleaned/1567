 Edward Benjamin Britten, Baron Britten, OM, CH (22 November 1913Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 4 December 1976) was an English composer, conductor and pianist. He was a central figure of 20th-century British classical music, with a range of works including opera, other vocal music, orchestral and chamber pieces. His best-known works include the opera Peter Grimes (1945), the War Requiem (1962) and the orchestral showpiece The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945).
Born in Suffolk, the son of a dentist, Britten showed talent from an early age. He studied at the Royal College of Music in London and privately with the composer Frank Bridge. Britten first came to public attention with the a cappella choral work A Boy Was Born in 1934. With the premiere of Peter Grimes in 1945, he leapt to international fame. Over the next 28 years, he wrote 14 more operas, establishing himself as one of the leading 20th-century composers in the genre. In addition to large-scale operas for Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden, he wrote &quot;chamber operas&quot; for small forces, suitable for performance in venues of modest size. Among the best known of these is The Turn of the Screw (1954). Recurring themes in the operas are the struggle of an outsider against a hostile society, and the corruption of innocence.
Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.
Together with Pears and the librettist and producer Eric Crozier, Britten founded the annual Aldeburgh Festival in 1948, and he was responsible for the creation of Snape Maltings concert hall in 1967. In his last year, he was the first composer to be given a life peerage.
Life and career
Early years
 Britten was born in the fishing port of Lowestoft in Suffolk, on the east coast of England.1 He was the youngest of the four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878&lt;U+2013&gt;1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Hockley (1874&lt;U+2013&gt;1937).{{#tag:ref|Britten's siblings were (Edith) Barbara (1902&lt;U+2013&gt;82), Robert Harry Marsh (&quot;Bobby&quot;, 1907&lt;U+2013&gt;87), and (Charlotte) Elizabeth (&quot;Beth&quot;, 1909&lt;U+2013&gt;89).2|group= n}} Robert Britten's youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at Charing Cross Hospital in London he met Edith Hockley, the daughter of a junior Home Office official. They were married in September 1901 at St John's, Smith Square, London.3
The consensus among biographers of Britten is that his father was a loving but somewhat stern and remote parent.4 Britten, according to his sister Beth, &quot;got on well with him and shared his wry sense of humour, dedication to work and capacity for taking pains&quot;.5 Edith Britten was a talented amateur musician and secretary of the Lowestoft Musical Society.6 In the English provinces of the early 20th century, distinctions of social class were taken very seriously. Britten described his family as &quot;very ordinary middle class&quot;, but there were aspects of the Brittens that were not ordinary: Edith's father was illegitimate, and her mother was an alcoholic; Robert Britten was an agnostic and refused to attend church on Sundays.7 Music was the principal means by which Edith Britten strove to maintain the family's social standing, inviting the pillars of the local community to musical soir&lt;U+00E9&gt;es at the house.8
When Britten was three months old he contracted pneumonia and nearly died.9 The illness left him with a damaged heart,10 and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life.11 He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer.12 To Edith Britten's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, or his brother, who was musically talented but interested only in ragtime.13 Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five.14 He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola.15 He was one of the last composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.16
Education
Lowestoft
When he was seven Britten was sent to a dame school, run by the Misses Astle. The younger sister, Ethel, gave him piano lessons; in later life he said that he remained grateful for the excellence of her teaching.17 The following year he moved on to his prep school, South Lodge, Lowestoft, as a day boy.18 The headmaster, Thomas Sewell, was an old-fashioned disciplinarian; the young Britten was outraged at the severe corporal punishments frequently handed out, and later he said that his lifelong pacifism probably had its roots in his reaction to the regime at the school.19 He himself rarely fell foul of Sewell, a mathematician, in which subject Britten was a star pupil. The school had no musical tradition, and Britten continued to study the piano with Ethel Astle. From the age of ten he took viola lessons from a friend of Edith Britten's, Audrey Alston, who had been a professional player before her marriage.20 In his spare time he composed prolifically. When his Simple Symphony, based on these juvenilia, was recorded in 1956, Britten wrote this pen-portrait of his young self for the sleeve note: 
 Audrey Alston encouraged Britten to go to symphony concerts in Norwich. At one of these, during the triennial Norfolk and Norwich Festival in October 1924, he heard Frank Bridge's orchestral poem The Sea, conducted by the composer. Britten was, in his own phrase, &quot;knocked sideways&quot;.21 Audrey Alston was a friend of Bridge; when he returned to Norwich for the next festival in 1927 she brought her 13-year-old pupil to meet him. Bridge was impressed with the boy, and after they had gone through some of Britten's compositions together he invited him to come to London to take lessons from him.22 Robert Britten, supported by Thomas Sewell, doubted the wisdom of pursuing a composing career; a compromise was agreed by which Britten would, as planned, go on to his public school the following year but would make regular day-trips to London to study composition with Bridge and piano with his colleague Harold Samuel.23
Bridge impressed on Britten the importance of scrupulous attention to the technical craft of composing{{#tag:ref|Britten later gave an example of the detailed skill instilled in him by Bridge: &quot;I came up with a series of major sevenths on the violin. Bridge was against this, saying that the instrument didn't vibrate properly with this interval: it should be divided between two instruments&quot;.24|group= n}} and the maxim that &quot;you should find yourself and be true to what you found.&quot;25 The earliest substantial works Britten composed while studying with Bridge are the String Quartet in F, completed in April 1928, and the Quatre Chansons Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;aises, a song-cycle for high voice and orchestra. Authorities differ on the extent of Bridge's influence on his pupil's technique. Humphrey Carpenter and Michael Oliver judge that Britten's abilities as an orchestrator were essentially self-taught;26 Donald Mitchell considers that Bridge had an important influence on the cycle.27
Public school and Royal College of Music
 In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. He did not enjoy his time there. He hated being separated from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though he was not the target of it.28 He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.29
Britten was at the RCM from 1930 to 1933, studying composition with Ireland and piano with Arthur Benjamin. He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition.30 These honours notwithstanding, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students &quot;amateurish and folksy&quot; and the staff &quot;inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere&quot;.31{{#tag:ref|This academic mistrust of Britten's technical skills persisted. In 1994 the critic Derrick Puffett wrote that in the 1960s Britten was still regarded with suspicion on account of his technical expertise; Puffett quoted remarks by the Professor of Music at Oxford in the 1960s, Sir Jack Westrup, to the effect that Britten was to be distrusted for his &quot;superficial effects&quot;, whereas Tippett was considered &quot;awkward and technically unskilled but somehow authentic.&quot;32|group= n}} Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be &quot;an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength&quot;; Britten was not, and learned little from him.33 He continued to study privately with Bridge,34 although he later praised Ireland for &quot;nurs[ing] me very gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence&quot;.35
Britten also used his time in London to attend concerts and become better acquainted with the music of Stravinsky, Shostakovich and, most particularly, Mahler.{{#tag:ref|Britten later wrote about his youthful discovery of Mahler that he had been told that the composer was &quot;long-winded and formlessÂ ... a romantic self-indulgent, who was so infatuated with his ideas that he could never stop. Either he couldn't score at all, or he could only score like Wagner, using enormous orchestras with so much going on that you couldn't hear anything clearly. Above all, he was not original. In other words, nothing for a young student!&quot; Britten judged, on the contrary, &quot;His influence on contemporary writingÂ ... could only be beneficial. His style is free from excessive personal mannerisms, and his scores are models of how the modern virtuoso orchestra should be used, nothing being left to chance and every note sounding.&quot;36|group= n}} He intended postgraduate study in Vienna with Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg's student, but was eventually dissuaded by his parents, on the advice of the RCM staff.37
The first of Britten's compositions to attract wide attention were composed while at the RCM: the Sinfonietta, Op. 1 (1932), and a set of choral variations A Boy was Born, written in 1933 for the BBC Singers, who first performed it the following year.38 In this same period he wrote Friday Afternoons, a collection of 12 songs for the pupils of Clive House School, Prestatyn, where his brother was headmaster.39
Early professional life
In February 1935, at Bridge's instigation, Britten was invited to a job interview by the BBC's director of music Adrian Boult and his assistant Edward Clark.40 Britten was not enthusiastic about the prospect of working full-time in the BBC music department and was relieved when what came out of the interview was an invitation to write the score for a documentary film, The King's Stamp, directed by Alberto Cavalcanti for the GPO Film Unit.41
 Britten became a member of the film unit's small group of regular contributors, another of whom was W H Auden. Together they worked on the documentary films Coal Face and Night Mail in 1935.42 They also collaborated on the song cycle Our Hunting Fathers (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including Cabaret Songs, On This Island, Paul Bunyan and Hymn to St. Cecilia.43 Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as David Matthews puts it, &quot;cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous&quot;; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.44
Britten composed prolifically in this period. In the three years from 1935 to 1937 he wrote nearly 40 scores for the theatre, cinema and radio.45 Among the film music of the late 1930s Matthews singles out Night Mail and Love from a Stranger (1937); among the theatre music he selects for mention, The Ascent of F6 (1936), On the Frontier (1938) and Johnson Over Jordan (1939); and of the music for radio, King Arthur (1937) and The Sword in the Stone (1939).46
In 1937 there were two events of huge importance in Britten's life: his mother died, and he met the tenor Peter Pears. Although Britten was extraordinarily devoted to his mother and was devastated at her death, it also seems to have been something of a liberation for him.47 Only after that did he begin to engage in emotional relationships with people his own age or younger.48 Later in the year he got to know Pears while they were both helping to clear out the country cottage of a mutual friend who had died in an air crash.49 Pears quickly became Britten's musical inspiration and close (though for the moment platonic) friend. Britten's first work for him was composed within weeks of their meeting, a setting of Emily Bront&lt;U+00EB&gt;'s poem, &quot;A thousand gleaming fires&quot;, for tenor and strings.50
During 1937 Britten composed a Pacifist March to words by Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, he had become an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn.51 The best known of his compositions from this period is probably Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic.52 It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.53
America 1939&lt;U+2013&gt;42
In April 1939 Britten and Pears sailed to North America, going first to Canada and then to New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, including the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances.5455 Their relationship ceased to be platonic, and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives.56 When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and were told that they should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors.57 Pears was inclined to disregard the advice and go back to England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.58
Already a friend of the composer Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music.59 In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the first of many song cycles for Pears.60 Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden.61 While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese gamelan music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording.62 This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.63
Moving to the US did not relieve Britten of the nuisance of hostile criticism: although Olin Downes, the doyen of New York music critics, and Irving Kolodin took to Britten's music, Virgil Thomson was, as the music scholar Suzanne Robinson puts it, consistently &quot;severe and spiteful&quot;. Thomson described Les Illuminations (1940) as &quot;little more than a series of bromidic and facile 'effects'Â ... pretentious, banal and utterly disappointing&quot;, and was equally unflattering about Pears's voice. Robinson surmises that Thomson was motivated by &quot;a mixture of spite, national pride, and professional jealousy&quot;.64 Paul Bunyan met with wholesale critical disapproval,65 and the Sinfonia da Requiem (already rejected by its Japanese sponsors because of its overtly Christian nature) received a mixed reception when Barbirolli and the New York Philharmonic premiered it in March 1941. The reputation of the work was much enhanced when Koussevitzky took it up shortly afterwards.66
Return to England
 In 1942 Britten read the work of the poet George Crabbe for the first time.67 The Borough, set on the Suffolk coast, awakened in him such longings for England that he knew he must return. He also knew that he must write an opera based on Crabbe's poem about the fisherman Peter Grimes.68 Before Britten left the US, Koussevitzky, always generous in encouraging new talent, offered him a $1,000 commission to write the opera.69{{#tag:ref|Koussevitzky's generosity later extended to waiving his rights to mount the first production, allowing Britten and his Sadler's Wells associates the chance to do so. The opera's first performance under Koussevitzky's aegis was at the Tanglewood Music Festival in 1947, conducted by the young Leonard Bernstein.70 Bernstein retained a love of the work, and he conducted the orchestral &quot;Sea Interludes&quot; from the opera at his final concert, given in Tanglewood in 1990, shortly before his death.71|group= n}} Britten and Pears returned to England in April 1942. During the long transatlantic sea crossing Britten completed the choral works A Ceremony of Carols and Hymn to St Cecilia. The latter was his last large-scale collaboration with Auden. Britten had grown away from him, and Auden became one of the composer's so-called &quot;corpses&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; former intimates from whom he completely cut off contact once they had outlived their usefulness to him or offended him in some way.72
Having arrived in Britain, Britten and Pears applied for recognition as conscientious objectors; Britten was initially allowed only non-combatant service in the military, but on appeal he gained unconditional exemption.73 After the death of his mother in 1937 he had used money she bequeathed him to buy the Old Mill in Snape, Suffolk, which became his country home. He spent much of his time there in 1944 working on the opera Peter Grimes. Pears joined Sadler's Wells Opera Company, whose artistic director, the singer Joan Cross, announced her intention to re-open the company's home base in London with Britten's opera, casting herself and Pears in the leading roles.{{#tag:ref|Sadler's Wells Theatre in Islington, London, was requisitioned by the government in 1942 as a refuge for people made homeless by air-raids; the Sadler's Wells opera company toured the British provinces, returning to its home base in June 1945.74 |group= n}} There were complaints from company members about supposed favouritism and the &quot;cacophony&quot; of Britten's score, as well as some ill-suppressed homophobic remarks.75 Peter Grimes opened in June 1945 and was hailed by public and critics;76 its box-office takings matched or exceeded those for La boh&lt;U+00E8&gt;me and Madame Butterfly, which were staged during the same season.77 The opera administrator Lord Harewood called it &quot;the first genuinely successful British opera, Gilbert and Sullivan apart, since Purcell.&quot;78 Dismayed by the in-fighting among the company, Cross, Britten and Pears severed their ties with Sadler's Wells in December 1945, going on to found what was to become the English Opera Group.79
A month after the opening of Peter Grimes, Britten and Yehudi Menuhin went to Germany to give recitals to concentration camp survivors.80 What they saw, at Belsen most of all, so shocked Britten that he refused to talk about it until towards the end of his life, when he told Pears that it had coloured everything he had written since.81 Colin Matthews comments that the next two works Britten composed after his return, the song-cycle The Holy Sonnets of John Donne and the Second String Quartet, contrast strongly with earlier, lighter-hearted works such as Les Illuminations.82 Britten recovered his joie de vivre for The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945), written for an educational film, Instruments of the Orchestra, directed by Muir Mathieson and featuring the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Malcolm Sargent.83 It became, and remained, his most often played and popular work.84
Britten's next opera, The Rape of Lucretia, was presented at the first post-war Glyndebourne Festival in 1946. It was then taken on tour to provincial cities under the banner of the &quot;Glyndebourne English Opera Company&quot;, an uneasy alliance of Britten and his associates with John Christie, the autocratic proprietor of Glyndebourne.85 The tour lost money heavily, and Christie announced that he would underwrite no more tours.86 Britten and his associates set up the English Opera Group; the librettist Eric Crozier and the designer John Piper joined Britten as artistic directors. The group's express purpose was to produce and commission new English operas and other works, presenting them throughout the country.87 Britten wrote the comic opera Albert Herring for the group in 1947; while on tour in the new work Pears came up with the idea of mounting a festival in the small Suffolk seaside town of Aldeburgh, where Britten had moved from Snape earlier in the year, and which became his principal residence for the rest of his life.88
Aldeburgh; the 1950s
The Aldeburgh Festival was launched in June 1948, with Britten, Pears and Crozier directing it.89 Albert Herring played at the Jubilee Hall, and Britten's new cantata for tenor, chorus and orchestra, Saint Nicolas, was presented in the parish church.90 The festival was an immediate success and became an annual event that has continued into the 21st century.91 New works by Britten featured in almost every festival until his death in 1976, including the premieres of his operas A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Jubilee Hall in 1960 and Death in Venice at Snape Maltings Concert Hall in 1973.92
 Unlike many leading English composers, Britten was not known as a teacher,{{#tag:ref|Sullivan, Parry, Stanford, Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Tippett were among the leading British composers of their time who held posts at conservatoires or universities.93 Those who, like Britten, were not known for teaching included Delius94 and Walton.95|group= n}} but in 1949 he accepted his only private pupil, Arthur Oldham, who studied with him for three years. Oldham made himself useful, acting as musical assistant and arranging Variations on a Theme by Frank Bridge for full orchestra for the Frederick Ashton ballet Le R&lt;U+00EA&gt;ve de L&lt;U+00E9&gt;onor (1949),96 but he later described the teacher-pupil relationship as &quot;beneficial five per cent to [Britten] and ninety-five per cent to me!&quot;97
Throughout the 1950s Britten continued to write operas. Billy Budd (1951) was well received at its Covent Garden premiere and was regarded by reviewers as an advance on Peter Grimes.98 Gloriana (1953), written to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, had a cool reception at the gala premiere in the presence of the Queen and the British Establishment en masse. The downbeat story of Elizabeth I in her decline, and Britten's score &lt;U+2013&gt; reportedly thought by members of the premiere's audience &quot;too modern&quot; for such a gala99 &lt;U+2013&gt; did not overcome what Matthews calls the &quot;ingrained philistinism&quot; of the ruling classes.100{{#tag:ref|The critic Andrew Porter wrote at the time: &quot;The audience naturally contained many people distinguished in political and social spheres rather than noted for their appreciation of twentieth-century music, and Gloriana was not well received at its first hearing. The usual philistine charges brought against it, as against so much contemporary music ('no tunes &lt;U+2013&gt; ugly, discordant sounds', and the rest), are beneath consideration. On the other hand, those who found Gloriana ill-suited to the occasion may be allowed to have some right on their side.&quot;101|group= n}} Although Gloriana did well at the box office, there were no further productions in Britain for another 13 years.102 It was later recognised as one of Britten's finer operas.103 The Turn of the Screw the following year was an unqualified success;104 together with Peter Grimes it became, and at 2013 remained, one of the two most frequently performed of Britten's operas.105
In the 1950s the &quot;fervently anti-homosexual&quot; Home Secretary, David Maxwell Fyfe,106 urged the police to enforce the Victorian laws making homosexual acts illegal.107{{#tag:ref|The principal law against homosexual acts was the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, in which Section 11 made any kind of sexual activity between men illegal for the first time. It was not repealed until the passage of the Sexual Offences Act 1967|group= n}} Britten and Pears came under scrutiny; Britten was visited by police officers in 1953 and was so perturbed that he discussed with his assistant Imogen Holst the possibility that Pears might have to enter a sham marriage (with whom is unclear). In the end nothing was done.108
An increasingly important influence on Britten was the music of the East, an interest that was fostered by a tour there with Pears in 1957, when Britten once again encountered the music of the Balinese gamelan109 and saw for the first time Japanese Noh plays, which he called &quot;some of the most wonderful drama I have ever seen.&quot;110 These eastern influences were seen and heard in the ballet The Prince of the Pagodas (1957) and later in two of the three semi-operatic &quot;Parables for Church Performance&quot;: Curlew River (1964) and The Prodigal Son (1968).111
1960s
By the 1960s, the Aldeburgh Festival was outgrowing its customary venues, and plans to build a new concert hall in Aldeburgh were not progressing. When redundant Victorian maltings buildings in the village of Snape, six miles inland, became available for hire, Britten had the vision that the largest of them could be converted into a concert hall and opera house. The 830-seat Snape Maltings hall was opened by the Queen at the start of the twentieth Aldeburgh Festival on 2 June 1967; it was immediately hailed as one of the best concert halls in the country.112 The hall was destroyed by fire in 1969, but Britten was determined that it would be rebuilt in time for the following year's festival, which it was. The Queen again attended the opening performance in 1970.113
 The Maltings gave the festival a venue that could comfortably house large orchestral works and operas. Britten conducted the first performance outside Russia of Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony at Snape in 1970.114 Shostakovich, a friend since 1960, dedicated the symphony to Britten;115 he was himself the dedicatee of The Prodigal Son.116 Two other Russian musicians who were close to Britten and regularly performed at the festival were the pianist Sviatoslav Richter and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten composed his cello suites, Cello Symphony and Cello Sonata for Rostropovich, who premiered them at the Aldeburgh Festival.117
One of the best known of Britten's works, the War Requiem, was premiered in 1962. He had been asked four years earlier to write a work for the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, a modernist building designed by Basil Spence. The old cathedral had been left in ruins by an air-raid on the city in 1940 in which hundreds of people died.118 Britten decided that his work would commemorate the dead of both World Wars in a large-scale score for soloists, chorus, chamber ensemble and orchestra. His text interspersed the traditional Requiem Mass with poems by Wilfred Owen. Matthews writes, &quot;With the War Requiem Britten reached the apex of his reputation: it was almost universally hailed as a masterpiece.&quot;119 Shostakovich told Rostropovich that he believed it to be &quot;the greatest work of the twentieth century&quot;.120
In 1967 the BBC commissioned Britten to write an opera specially for television. Owen Wingrave was based, like The Turn of the Screw, on a ghost story by Henry James.121 By the 1960s Britten found composition much slower than in his prolific youth; he told the 28-year-old composer Nicholas Maw, &quot;Get as much done now as you can, because it gets much, much more difficult as you grow older.&quot;122 He did not complete the score of the new opera until August 1970.123 Owen Wingrave was first broadcast in Britain in May 1971, when it was also televised in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the USA and Yugoslavia.124
Last years
In September 1970 Britten asked Myfanwy Piper, who had adapted the two Henry James stories for him, to turn another prose story into a libretto. This was Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice, a subject he had been considering for some time.125 At an early stage in composition Britten was told by his doctors that a heart operation was essential if he was to live for more than two years. He was determined to finish the opera and worked urgently to complete it before going into hospital for surgery.126 His long-term colleague Colin Graham wrote: 
After the completion of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 to replace a failing heart valve. The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end.127 While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.128
Britten's last works include the Suite on English Folk Tunes &quot;A Time There Was&quot; (1974); the Third String Quartet (1975), which drew on material from Death in Venice; and the dramatic cantata Phaedra (1975), written for Janet Baker.129
In the last year of his life Britten accepted a life peerage &lt;U+2013&gt; the first composer so honoured &lt;U+2013&gt; and in July 1976 became Baron Britten of Aldeburgh in the County of Suffolk.130{{#tag:ref|Some writers have supposed that Britten was earlier offered and had declined a knighthood,131 but his name is not included in the official list issued in 2012 by the Cabinet Office naming everyone (except those still living at the time of publication) who had declined an honour between 1950 and 1999.132|group= n}} After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We Great Men, for voices and orchestra based on a poem by Edith Sitwell.133 He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir and orchestra.134 In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose.135 On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer.136 When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We Great Men.137
Britten died of congestive heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later,138 and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone.139 The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had made it clear that he wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears.140 A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.141

Despite his large number of works on Christian themes, Britten has sometimes been thought of as agnostic.142 Pears said that when they met in 1937 he was not sure whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian.143 In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God.144 Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.145
Physically, Britten was never robust. He walked and swam regularly and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, a few of them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed.146 Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world.147148 He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism from anybody else.149
Britten was, as he acknowledged, notorious for dumping friends and colleagues who either offended him or ceased to be of use &lt;U+2013&gt; his &quot;corpses&quot;.150 The conductor Sir Charles Mackerras believed that the term was invented by Lord Harewood. Both Mackerras and Harewood joined the list of corpses, the former for joking that the number of boys in Noye's Fludde must have been a delight to the composer, and the latter for an extramarital affair and subsequent divorce from Lady Harewood, which shocked the puritanical Britten.151 Among other corpses were his librettists Montagu Slater and Eric Crozier. The latter said in 1949, &quot;He has sometimes told me, jokingly, that one day I would join the ranks of his 'corpses' and I have always recognized that any ordinary person must soon outlive his usefulness to such a great creative artist as Ben.&quot;152 Dame Janet Baker said in 1981, &quot;I think he was quite entitled to take what he wanted from othersÂ ... He did not want to hurt anyone, but the task in hand was more important than anything or anybody.&quot;153 Matthews feels that this aspect of Britten has been exaggerated, and he observes that the composer sustained many deep friendships to the end of his life.154
Controversies
Boys
Britten was attracted to young boys &lt;U+2013&gt; what Auden called &quot;thin-as-a-board juveniles &lt;U+2013&gt; sexless and innocent&quot;.155 In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter's 1992 biography addresses the matter, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly John Bridcut's Britten's Children (2006), which concentrates on this aspect of the composer. Among those to whom Britten was drawn were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, who sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s.156 Hemmings later said, &quot;In all of the time that I spent with him he never abused that trust&quot;, and Crawford wrote &quot;I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great manÂ ... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music.&quot;157 Some commentators have continued to question Britten's conduct, sometimes very sharply;158 Carpenter and Bridcut conclude that he held any sexual impulses under firm control and kept the relationships affectionate but strictly platonic.159
Cause of death
A more recent controversy was the statement in a 2013 biography of Britten by Paul Kildea that the composer's heart failure was due to undetected syphilis, which Kildea speculates was a result of Pears's promiscuity while the two were living in New York.160 In response, Britten's consultant cardiologist said that, like all the hospital's similar cases, Britten was routinely screened for syphilis before the operation, with negative results.161 He described as &quot;complete rubbish&quot; Kildea's allegation that the surgeon who operated on Britten in 1973 would or even could have covered up a syphilitic condition.162 Kildea continued to maintain, &quot;When all the composer's symptoms are considered there can be only one cause&quot;.163 In The Times, Richard Morrison praised the rest of Kildea's book, and hoped that its reputation would not be &quot;tarnished by one sensational speculationÂ ... some second-hand hearsayÂ ... presenting unsubstantiated gossip as fact&quot;.164
Music
Influences
Britten's early musical life was dominated by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the &quot;Fourth B&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms.165 Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: &quot;Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthdayÂ ... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations&quot;.166 He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, &quot;to see if I am right about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!&quot;167
Through his association with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded.168 He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, &quot;gave him a model for an orchestral sound&quot;.169 Bridge also led Britten to the music of Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: &quot;The real musicians are so few &amp; far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs &amp; Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; adding, as an afterthought: &quot;Shostakovitch &lt;U+2013&gt; perhaps &lt;U+2013&gt; possibly&quot;.170 By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English pastoral school represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the &quot;brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger&quot;; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements.171172 Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought Brigg Fair &quot;delicious&quot; when he heard it in 1931.173 Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he found &quot;bewildering and terrifying&quot;, yet at the same time &quot;incredibly marvellous and arresting&quot;. The same composer's Symphony of Psalms, and Petrushka were lauded in similar terms.174
Besides his growing attachments to the works of 20th century masters, Britten &lt;U+2013&gt; along with his contemporary Michael Tippett &lt;U+2013&gt; was devoted to the English music of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, in particular the work of Purcell.175 In defining his mission as a composer of opera, Britten wrote: &quot;One of my chief aims is to try to restore to the musical setting of the English Language a brilliance, freedom and vitality that have been curiously rare since the death of Purcell&quot;.176 Among the closest of Britten's kindred composer spirits &lt;U+2013&gt; even more so than Purcell &lt;U+2013&gt; was Mahler, whose Fourth Symphony Britten heard in September 1930. At that time Mahler's music was little regarded and rarely played in English concert halls.177 Britten later wrote of how the scoring of this work impressed him: &quot;...Â entirely clean and transparentÂ ... the material was remarkable, and the melodic shapes highly original, with such rhythmic and harmonic tension from beginning to end&quot;.178 He soon discovered other Mahler works, in particular Das Lied von der Erde; he wrote to a friend about the concluding &quot;Abschied&quot; of Das Lied: &quot;It is cruel, you know, that music should be so beautiful&quot;.179{{#tag:ref|In 1938, Britten attended what was only the second British performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony, the &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;, with Sir Henry Wood and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Britten declared himself &quot;tremendously impressed&quot; by the music, though he thought the performance &quot;execrable&quot;.180|group= n}} Apart from Mahler's general influence on Britten's compositional style, the incorporation by Britten of popular tunes (as, for example, in Death in Venice) is a direct inheritance from the older composer.181
Operas
The Britten-Pears Foundation considers the composer's operas &quot;perhaps the most substantial and important part of his compositional legacy.&quot;182 Britten's operas are firmly established in the international repertoire: according to Operabase, they are performed worldwide more than those of any other composer born in the 20th century,183 and only Puccini and Richard Strauss come ahead of him if the list is extended to all operas composed after 1900.184
The early operetta Paul Bunyan stands apart from Britten's later operatic works. Philip Brett, in Grove's article on Britten, calls it &quot;a patronizing attempt by W H Auden to evoke the spirit of a nation not his own in which Britten was a somewhat dazzled accomplice&quot;.185 The American public liked it, but the critics did not,{{#tag:ref|The critics' outrage at the presumption of Auden and Britten in writing an American work mirrored the hostile response of London critics six years earlier when Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein presented Three Sisters, a musical set in England.186|group=n}} and it fell into neglect until interest revived near the end of the composer's life.187
 Britten's subsequent operas range from large-scale works written for full-strength opera companies, to chamber operas for performance by small touring opera ensembles or in churches and schools. In the large-scale category are Peter Grimes (1945), Billy Budd (1951), Gloriana (1953), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1960) and Death in Venice (1973). Of the remaining operas, The Rape of Lucretia (1946), Albert Herring (1947), The Little Sweep (1949) and The Turn of the Screw (1954) were written for small opera companies. Noye's Fludde (1958), Curlew River (1964), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1966), and The Prodigal Son (1968) were for church performance, and the secular The Golden Vanity was intended to be performed in schools. Owen Wingrave, written for television, was first presented live by the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in 1973, two years after its broadcast premiere.188
Music critics have frequently commented on the recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society.189 The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated.190 Another recurrent theme is the corruption of innocence, most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.191
Over the 28 years between Peter Grimes and Death in Venice Britten's musical style changed, as he introduced elements of atonalism &lt;U+2013&gt; though remaining essentially a tonal composer &lt;U+2013&gt; and of eastern music, particularly gamelan sounds but also eastern harmonies.192 In A Midsummer Night's Dream the orchestral scoring varies to fit the nature of each set of characters: &quot;the bright, percussive sounds of harps, keyboards and percussion for the fairy world, warm strings and wind for the pairs of lovers, and lower woodwind and brass for the mechanicals&quot;.193 In Death in Venice Britten turns Tadzio and his family into silent dancers, &quot;accompanied by the colourful, glittering sounds of tuned percussion to emphasize their remoteness.&quot;194
As early as 1948 the music analyst Hans Keller, summarising Britten's impact on 20th-century opera to that date, compared his contribution to that of Mozart in the 18th century: &quot;Mozart may in some respects be regarded as a founder (a 'second founder') of opera. The same can already be said today, as far as the modern British &lt;U+2013&gt; perhaps not only British &lt;U+2013&gt; field goes, of Britten&quot;.195 In addition to his own original operas, Britten, together with Imogen Holst, extensively revised Purcell's Dido and Aeneas (1951) and The Fairy-Queen (1967). These &quot;realisations&quot; brought Purcell, who was then neglected, to a wider public, but have themselves been neglected since the dominance of the trend to authentic performance practice.196 His 1948 revision of The Beggar's Opera amounts to a wholesale recomposition, retaining the original melodies but giving them new, highly sophisticated orchestral accompaniments.197
Song cycles
Throughout his career Britten was drawn to the song cycle form. In 1928, when he was 14, he composed an orchestral cycle, Quatre chansons fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;aises, setting words by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine. Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner on the one hand and French mannerisms on the other, &quot;the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in 'L'enfance' is entirely characteristic&quot;.198 After he came under Auden's influence Britten composed Our Hunting Fathers (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is &quot;as exciting as Les Illuminations, and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works.&quot;199
 The first of Britten's song cycles to gain widespread popularity was Les Illuminations (1940), for high voice (originally soprano, later more often sung by tenors){{#tag:ref|Matthews comments that the work is &quot;so much more sensuous when sung by the soprano voice for which the songs were conceived&quot;.200|group= n}} with string orchestra accompaniment, setting words by Arthur Rimbaud. Britten's music reflects the eroticism in Rimbaud's poems; Copland commented of the section &quot;Antique&quot; that he did not know how Britten dared to write the melody.201 Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten's early years.202 By the time of Britten's next cycle, Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo (1942) for tenor and piano, Pears had become his partner and muse; in Matthews's phrase, Britten wrote the cycle as &quot;his declaration of love for Peter&quot;.203 It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets, though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th-century song cycle. Mason draws a distinction between this and Britten's earlier cycles, because here each song is self-contained, and has no thematic connection with any of the others.204
The Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings (1943) sets verses by a variety of poets, all on the theme of night-time. Though Britten described the cycle as &quot;not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think&quot;, it was immediately greeted as a masterpiece, and together with Peter Grimes it established him as one of the leading composers of his day.205 Mason calls it &quot;a beautifully unified work on utterly dissimilar poems, held together by the most superficial but most effective, and therefore most suitable symphonic method. Some of the music is pure word-painting, some of it mood-painting, of the subtlest kind.&quot;206 Two years later, after witnessing the horrors of Belsen, Britten composed '' The Holy Sonnets of John Donne'', a work whose bleakness was not matched until his final tenor and piano cycle a quarter of a century later. Britten's technique in this cycle ranges from atonality in the first song to firm tonality later, with a resolute B major chord at the climax of &quot;Death, be not proud&quot;.207
Nocturne (1958) is the last of the orchestral cycles. As in the Serenade, Britten set words by a range of poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen.208 The whole cycle is darker in tone than the Serenade, with pre-echoes of the War Requiem.209 All the songs have subtly different orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different instrument in each.210 Among Britten's later song cycles with piano accompaniment is the Songs and Proverbs of William Blake, composed for the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. This presents all its poems in a continuous stream of music; Brett writes that it &quot;interleaves a ritornello-like setting of the seven proverbs with seven songs that paint an increasingly sombre picture of human existence.&quot;211 A Pushkin cycle, The Poet's Echo (1965), was written for Galina Vishnevskaya, and shows a more robust and extrovert side of the composer.212 Though written ostensibly in the tradition of European song cycles, it draws atmospherically on the polyphony of south-east Asian music.213 Who are these Children? (1969), setting 12 verses by William Soutar, is among the grimmest of Britten's cycles. After he could no longer play the piano, Britten composed a cycle of Robert Burns settings, A Birthday Hansel (1976), for voice and harp.214
Other vocal works
Nicholas Maw said of Britten's vocal music: &quot;His feeling for poetry (not only English) and the inflexions of language make him, I think, the greatest musical realizer of English&quot;.215 One of the best-known works in which Britten set poetry was the War Requiem (1962). It intersperses the Latin requiem mass, sung by soprano and chorus, with settings of works by the First World War poet Wilfred Owen, sung by tenor and baritone. At the end the two elements are combined, as the last line of Owen's &quot;Strange meeting&quot; mingles with the In paradisum of the mass. Matthews describes the conclusion of the work as &quot;a great wave of benediction [which] recalls the end of the Sinfonia da Requiem, and its similar ebbing away into the sea that symbolises both reconciliation and death.&quot;216 Other works for voices and orchestra include the Missa Brevis and the Cantata academica (both 1959) on religious themes, and the late cantata Phaedra (1975), a story of fated love and death modelled on Handel's Italian cantatas.217
Smaller-scale works for accompanied voice include the five Canticles, composed between 1947 and 1974. They are written for a variety of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V).218 The first is a setting of Francis Quarles's 17th century poem &quot;A Divine Rapture&quot;,219 and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell's Divine Hymns'.220 Matthews describes it as one of the composer's most serene works, which &quot;ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten's music&quot;.221 The second Canticle was written in 1952, between Billy Budd and Gloriana, on the theme of Abraham's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac.222 {{#tag:ref|The piece was much admired by Tippett as &quot;one of the wonderful things in Britten's music&quot;, an opinion with which Britten apparently concurred.223|group= n}} &quot;Canticle III&quot; from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell's wartime poem &quot;Still Falls the Rain&quot;, composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten's compositional technique.224 The fourth Canticle, premiered in 1971 is based on T. S. Eliot's poem &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;. It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a &quot;companion piece&quot; to the earlier work.225 The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem &quot;Death of Saint Narcissus&quot;. Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about,226 the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text &quot;almost frighteningly aptÂ ... for a composer conscious of his own sickness&quot;.227 Matthews sees Narcissus as &quot;another figure from [Britten's] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty&quot;.228
Orchestral works
The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, &quot;It is easy, because of the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay insufficient attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres.&quot;229 Maw said of Britten, &quot;He is one of the 20th century's great orchestral composersÂ ... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers.&quot;230 Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich&lt;U+00E9&gt;s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale.231 The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies Irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as &quot;the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible&quot;.232 Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: &quot;less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic&quot;.233 The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between &quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;. The commentator Howard Posner observes that there is not a bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding.234 The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, It showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset.235236 Christopher Headington calls the work &quot;exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [that] fits well into Britten's oeuvre.&quot;237 David Matthews calls it &quot;a brilliant educational exercise.&quot;238{{#tag:ref|The piece is formally sub-titled &quot;Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Henry Purcell&quot;; Britten greatly disliked the BBC's practice of referring to the work by the grander sub-title in preference to his preferred title.239|group= n}}
Unlike his English predecessors such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams, and composers from mainland Europe whom he admired, including Mahler and Shostakovich, Britten was not a classical symphonist. His youthful jeux d'esprit the Simple Symphony (1934) is in conventional symphonic structure, observing sonata form and the traditional four-movement pattern, but of his mature works his Spring Symphony (1949) is more a song cycle than a true symphony,240 and the concertante Cello Symphony (1963) is an attempt to balance the traditional concerto and symphony. During its four movements the Cello Symphony moves from a deeply pessimistic opening to a finale of radiant happiness rare for Britten by this point.241 The composer considered it &quot;the finest thing I've written&quot;.242
The Piano Concerto (1938) was at first criticised for being too light-hearted and virtuoso. In 1945 Britten revised it, replacing a skittish third movement with a more sombre passacaglia that, in Matthews's view, gives the work more depth, and makes the apparent triumph of the finale more ambivalent.243 The Violin Concerto (1940) has virtuoso elements, but they are balanced by lyrical and elegiac passages, &quot;undoubtedly reflecting Britten's growing concern with the escalation of world hostilities.&quot;244 Neither concerto is among Britten's most popular works, but in the 21st century the Violin Concerto has been performed more frequently than before, both in the concert hall and on record.245
Britten's incidental music for theatre, film and radio, much of it unpublished, was the subject of an essay by William Mann, published in 1952 in the first detailed critical assessment of Britten's music to that date.246 Of these pieces the music for a radio play, The Rescue, by Edward Sackville-West, is praised by the musicologist Lewis Foreman as &quot;of such stature and individual character as to be worth a regular place alongside [Britten's] other dramatic scores.&quot;247 Mann finds in this score pre-echoes of the second act of Billy Budd,248 while Foreman observes that Britten &quot;appears to have made passing allusions to The Rescue in his final opera, Death in Venice.249
Chamber and instrumental works
Britten's close friendship with Rostropovich inspired the Cello Sonata (1961) and three suites for solo cello (1964&lt;U+2013&gt;71).250 String quartets featured throughout Britten's composing career, from a student work in 1928 to his Third String Quartet (1975). The second Quartet, from 1947, was written in homage to Purcell; Mason considered it Britten's most important instrumental work to that date.251 Referring to this work, Keller writes of the ease with which Britten, relatively early in his compositional career, solves &quot;the modern sonata problem &lt;U+2013&gt; the achievement of symmetry and unity within an extended ternary circle based on more than one subject&quot;. Keller likens the innovatory skill of the Quartet to that of Walton's Viola Concerto.252 The third Quartet was Britten's last major work; the critic Colin Anderson said of it in 2007, &quot;one of Britten's greatest achievements, one with interesting allusions to Bart&lt;U+00F3&gt;k and Shostakovich, and written with an economy that opens out a depth of emotion that can be quite chilling.&quot;253 The Gemini Variations (1965), for flute, violin and piano duet, were based on a theme of Zolt&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Kod&lt;U+00E1&gt;ly and written as a virtuoso piece for the 13-year-old Jeney twins, musical prodigies whom Britten had met in Budapest in the previous year.254 For Osian Ellis, Britten wrote the Suite for Harp (1969), which Joan Chissell in The Times described as &quot;a little masterpiece of concentrated fancy&quot;.255
Legacy
Britten's fellow-composers had divided views about him. To Tippett he was &quot;simply the most musical person I have ever met&quot;, with an &quot;incredible&quot; technical mastery;256 some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett's view Walton and others were convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music,{{#tag:ref|Steuart Wilson, a retired singer who held a succession of posts as a musical administrator, launched an outspoken campaign in 1955 against &quot;homosexuality in British music&quot; and was quoted as saying: &quot;The influence of perverts in the world of music has grown beyond all measure. If it is not curbed soon, Covent Garden and other precious musical heritages could suffer irreparable harm.&quot;257|group= n}} a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy at Britten's postwar successes.258 Leonard Bernstein considered Britten &quot;a man at odds with the world&quot;, and said of his music: &quot;[I]f you hear it, not just listen to it superficially, you become aware of something very dark&quot;.259 The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten in the latter part of the composer's career, made a similar point: &quot;There was a great, huge abyss in his soulÂ ... He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn't get out&quot;.260
In the decade after Britten's death, his standing as a composer in Britain was to some extent overshadowed by that of the still-living Tippett.261 The film-maker Tony Palmer, who in 1980 directed a TV documentary about Britten, thought that Tippett's temporary ascendancy might have been a question of the two composers' contrasting personalities: Tippett had more warmth and had made fewer enemies. In any event this was a short-lived phenomenon; Tippett adherents such as the composer Robert Saxton soon rediscovered their enthusiasm for Britten, whose audience steadily increased during the final years of the 20th century.262 Britten has had few imitators; Brett describes him as &quot;inimitable, possessed ofÂ ... a voice and sound too dangerous to imitate.263 Nevertheless, after his death Britten was lauded by the younger generation of English composers to whom, in the words of Oliver Knussen, he became &quot;a phenomenal father-figure&quot;.264 Brett believes that he affected every subsequent British composer to some extent: &quot;He is a key figure in the growth of British musical culture in the second half of the 20th century, and his effect on everything from opera to the revitalization of music education is hard to overestimate.&quot;265
Whittall believes that one reason for Britten's enduring popularity is the &quot;progressive conservatism&quot; of his music. He generally avoided the avant garde, and did not challenge the conventions in the way that contemporaries such as Tippett did.266 Perhaps, says Brett, &quot;the tide that swept away serialism, atonality and most forms of musical modernism and brought in neo-Romanticism, minimalism and other modes of expression involved with tonality carried with it renewed interest in composers who had been out of step with the times&quot;.267 Britten defined his mission as a composer in very simple terms: composers should aim at &quot;pleasing people today as seriously as we can&quot;.268
Pianist and conductor
Britten, though a reluctant conductor and a nervous pianist, was greatly sought after in both capacities.269 The piano accompanist Gerald Moore wrote in his memoirs about playing at all the main music festivals except for Aldeburgh, because &quot;as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world, my services are not needed&quot;.270{{#tag:ref|In 2006 Gramophone magazine invited eminent present-day accompanists to name their &quot;professional's professional&quot;: the joint winners were Britten and Moore.271|group= n}} Britten's recital partnership with Pears was his best-known collaboration, but he also accompanied Kathleen Ferrier, Rostropovich, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James Bowman and John Shirley-Quirk, among others.272 Though usually too nervous to play piano solos, Britten often performed piano duets with Clifford Curzon or Richter, and chamber music with the Amadeus Quartet.273 The composers whose works, other than his own, he most often played were Mozart and Schubert; the latter, in Murray Perahia's view, was Britten's greatest idol.274 As a boy and young man, Britten had intensely admired Brahms, but his admiration waned to nothing, and Brahms seldom featured in his repertory.{{#tag:ref|Britten once said, &quot;It's not bad Brahms I mind, it's good Brahms I can't stand&quot;.275|group= n}}
Singers and players admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough to offer him the musical directorship of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952.{{#tag:ref|So writes John Bridcut,276 but Webster's biographer, Montague Haltrecht, recounts that no formal offer of the post was made to Britten. According to Haltrecht, Lord Harewood and other Covent Garden board members wanted Britten for the post, but Webster believed that it was above all as a composer that Britten could bring glory to Covent Garden.277|group= n}} Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as a conductor and was reluctant to spend too much time performing rather than composing.278 As a conductor, Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.279280
Recordings
Britten, like Elgar and Walton before him, was signed up by a major British recording company,{{#tag:ref|Elgar was an exclusive HMV artist;281 Walton, after a brief spell with Decca, made most of his recordings for Columbia.282|group= n}} and performed a considerable proportion of his output on disc. For the Decca Record Company he made some early monaural records, and with the enthusiastic support of the Decca producer John Culshaw he made numerous stereophonic versions of his works.283 Culshaw wrote, &quot;The happiest hours I have spent in any studio were with Ben, for the basic reason that it did not seem that we were trying to make records or video tapes; we were just trying to make music.&quot;284{{#tag:ref|Imogen Holst remembered Britten's recording sessions differently: &quot;He used to find recording sessions more exhausting than anything else, and dreaded the days when he had to stop writing a new opera in order to record the one before last.&quot;285|group= n}}
In May 1943 Britten made his debut in the Decca studios, accompanying Sophie Wyss in five of his arrangements of French folk songs. The following January he and Pears recorded together, in Britten's arrangements of British folk songs, and the following day, in duet with Curzon he recorded his Introduction and Rondo alla burlesca and Mazurka elegiaca. In May 1944 he conducted the Boyd Neel string orchestra, Dennis Brain and Pears in the first recording of the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, which has frequently been reissued, most recently on CD.286
Britten's first operatic recording was The Turn of the Screw, made in January 1955 with the original English Opera Group forces. In 1957 he conducted The Prince of the Pagodas in an early stereo recording, supervised by Culshaw.287 Decca's first major commercial success with Britten came the following year, with Peter Grimes, which has, at 2013, never been out of the catalogues since its first release.288 From 1958 Britten conducted Decca recordings of many of his operas and vocal and orchestral works, including the Nocturne (1959), the Spring Symphony (1960), Noye's Fludde (1961) and the War Requiem (1963).289 The last sold in unexpectedly large numbers for a classical set, and thereafter Decca unstintingly made resources available to Culshaw and his successors for Britten recordings.290 Sets followed of Albert Herring (1964), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1964) Curlew River (1965), A Midsummer Night's Dream (1966), The Burning Fiery Furnace (1967), Billy Budd (1967) and many of the other major works.291 In 2013, to mark the anniversary of Britten's birth, Decca released a set of 65 CDs and one DVD, &quot;Benjamin Britten &lt;U+2013&gt; Complete Works&quot;.{{#tag:ref|The set comprises all the composer's works with opus numbers and all works commercially recorded by 2013 (many fragments and juvenilia have not been published or recorded). The set includes Britten's folksong arrangements, but excludes his Purcell realisations.292|group= n}} Most of the recordings were from Decca's back catalogue, but in the interests of comprehensiveness a substantial number of tracks were licensed from 20 other companies including EMI, Virgin Classics, Naxos, Warner and NMC.293
As a pianist and conductor in other composers' music, Britten made many recordings for Decca. Among his studio collaborations with Pears are sets of Schubert's Winterreise and Die sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;ne M&lt;U+00FC&gt;llerin, Schumann's Dichterliebe, and songs by Haydn, Mozart, Bridge, Ireland, Holst, Tippett and Richard Rodney Bennett.294 Other soloists whom Britten accompanied on record were Ferrier, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya. For Decca he conducted works by a wide range of composers, from Purcell to Grainger. Among his best-known recordings are The Fairy-Queen, the Brandenburg concertos, The Dream of Gerontius and Mozart's last two symphonies.295
Honours, awards and commemorations
State honours awarded to Britten included Companion of Honour (Britain) in 1953; Commander of the Royal Order of the Polar Star (Sweden) in 1962; and the Order of Merit (Britain) in 1965. He received honorary degrees and fellowships from 19 conservatoires and universities in Europe and America. His awards included the Hanseatic Goethe Prize (1961); the Aspen Award, Colorado (1964); the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal (1964); the Sibelius Prize (1965); the Mahler Medal (Bruckner and Mahler Society of America, 1967); the L&lt;U+00E9&gt;onie Sonning Music Prize (Denmark, 1968); the Ernst von Siemens Prize (1974); and the Ravel Prize (1974).296
Prizes for individual works included UNESCO's International Rostrum of Composers 1961 (for A Midsummer Night's Dream); and for the War Requiem Grammy Awards 1963 &lt;U+2013&gt; Classical Album of the Year, Best Classical Composition by a Contemporary Composer and Best Classical Performance &lt;U+2013&gt; Choral (Other than Opera); the BRIT Awards 1977 &lt;U+2013&gt; Best Orchestral Album of the past 25 years; and the Grammy Hall of Fame Award 1998.297
The Red House in Aldeburgh, where Britten and Pears lived and worked together from 1957 until Britten's death in 1976, is now the home of the Britten-Pears Foundation, established to promote their musical legacy.298 In Britten's centenary year his studio at the Red House was restored to the way it was in the 1950s and opened to the public. The converted hayloft was designed and built by H T Cadbury Brown in 1958 and was described by Britten as a &quot;magnificent work&quot;.299 In June 2013 Dame Janet Baker officially opened the Britten-Pears archive in a new building in the grounds of the Red House.300
 A memorial stone to Britten was unveiled in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey in 1978.301 There are memorial plaques to him at two of his London homes: 45a St John's Wood High Street,302 and 8 Halliford Street in Islington.303 In April 2013 Britten was honoured by the Royal Mail in the UK, as one of ten people selected as subjects for the &quot;Great Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue.304
Other creative artists have celebrated Britten. In 1970 Walton composed Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten, based on a theme from Britten's Piano Concerto.305 Works commemorating Britten include Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten an orchestral piece written in 1977 by Arvo P&lt;U+00E4&gt;rt, and Sally Beamish's Variations on a Theme of Benjamin Britten, based on the second Sea Interlude from Peter Grimes; she composed the work to mark Britten's centenary.306 Alan Bennett depicts Britten in a 2009 play The Habit of Art, set while Britten is composing Death in Venice and centred on a fictional meeting between Britten and Auden. Britten was played in the premiere production by Alex Jennings.307
Britten 100
In September 2012, to mark the composer's forthcoming centenary, the Britten-Pears Foundation launched &quot;Britten 100&quot; at the Britten Theatre in the Royal College of Music. The events planned were a collaboration of leading organisations from the worlds of performing arts, publishing, broadcasting, film, academia and heritage.308 The feature film Benjamin Britten &lt;U+2013&gt; Peace and Conflict, written and directed by Tony Britten, and narrated by John Hurt, was released in May 2013. It includes observations from Joseph Horovitz, from the cellist and Auschwitz Women's Orchestra survivor Anita Lasker Wallfisch, and from Sue Phipps, Peter Pears's niece and agent to Pears and Britten.309 In London, the British Library mounted a centenary exhibition, &quot;Poetry in Sound: The Music of Benjamin Britten&quot;, using its extensive collection of Britten manuscripts, with an accompanying series of talks by Britten experts.310
In Britain centenary performances of the War Requiem were announced for 18 venues including St Paul's Cathedral and the Royal Albert Hall; opera productions included Owen Wingrave at Aldeburgh, Billy Budd at Glyndebourne, Death in Venice by English National Opera, Gloriana by The Royal Opera, and Peter Grimes, Death in Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by Opera North.311 Internationally, the centenary is marked by performances of the War Requiem in Australia, Austria, China, Germany, Hungary, Japan and Russia; Peter Grimes in China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia; and many of the other works across the world.312 In The New York Times Anthony Tommasini wrote in June 2013, &quot;In America alone the Britten festivities are coast to coast,&quot; and listed some of the major centenary events, including a festival at Carnegie Hall, performances at the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera and Los Angeles Opera.313
On 17 June Peter Grimes was performed on the beach for the first time, at Aldeburgh, as the opening to the 2013 Aldeburgh Festival, with Steuart Bedford conducting and singers from the Chorus of Opera North and the Chorus of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.314 In The Guardian, Andrew Clements described it as &quot;a remarkable, and surely unrepeatable achievement.&quot;315
In London, the opening night of the Proms, on 12 July 2013, featured a performance of the &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; from Peter Grimes.316
