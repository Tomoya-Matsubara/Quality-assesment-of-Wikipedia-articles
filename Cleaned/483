History
Ronald Cuthbert Hay was born on 4 October 1916, at Perth, Scotland. He was one of five children (three girls and two boys) of Captain Cuthbert Joseph Hay and Letitia Griffith Fausset.2 He was educated at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire.3
Second World War
Ronald Cuthbert Hay, volunteered for the Royal Marines in 1935, and served a year at sea in the cruiser . He then volunteered for flying duties with the Fleet Air Arm and was posted to the recently reformed 801 Naval Air Squadron. The squadron assigned to the fleet carrier  was equipped with the two seater Blackburn Skua and Blackburn Roc fighter aircraft.4 His first victory during operations over Norway was on the 27 April 1940, which he later described in detail;
&quot;We ran into a Heinkel He 111 bomber, Lieutenant Bill Church attacked from astern and the bomber dived to sea level. They exchanged fire, and when Bill pulled upwards to break off the attack, his aircraft was struck in the belly and crashed into the sea without any survivors. I had learned my first lesson in air fighting with a vengeance-never break away upwards. I therefore sat on the tail of the bomber and fired short bursts until it crashed into the sea.&quot;5
On 31 May Hays squadron joined 806 Naval Air Squadron at Detling in Kent to cover the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the beaches at Dunkirk. They mainly used the Skua in its dive bomber role, which was no match for the German Messerschmitt Bf 109s.6 After one mission Hay's plane was only one of four that returned the rest having been shot down. The squadron remained in Kent until 27 June when the survivors were sent back to their home base.7 Hay was next transferred to the Fairey Fulmar equipped 808 Naval Air Squadron which was based at Wick, West Sussex. The squadron was one of only two Fleet Air Arm fighter squadrons that fought in the Battle of Britain under RAF Fighter Command control.8
