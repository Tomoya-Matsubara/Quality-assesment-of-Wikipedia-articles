Maryland Route 704 (MD 704) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Martin Luther King Jr. Highway, the state highway runs  from Eastern Avenue at the District of Columbia boundary in Seat Pleasant east to MD 450 in Lanham. MD 704 was constructed in the early 1940s from Seat Pleasant to U.S. Route 50 (now MD 450) along the right-of-way of the abandoned Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway. The highway was expanded to a multi-lane divided highway west of US 50 in the 1960s and 1970s and at its eastern end in 2000.
