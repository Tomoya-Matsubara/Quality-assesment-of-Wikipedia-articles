SS Kommandren was a steel-hulled passenger/cargo steamship built in Norway in 1891. She served as a communications link between the regional capital of Western Norway, Bergen, and the various communities of Sogn og Fjordane county. 
Following the 9 April 1940 German Operation Weserbung invasion of Norway, she was requisitioned by the Norwegian authorities and carried troops for the Norwegian Campaign Norwegian war effort until the forces in Western Norway ceased fighting on 2 May 1940.
After a brief stint in German service, she returned to her civilian duties later in 1940, and was accidentally torpedoed and sunk by a German E-boat in Bergen on 29 March 1945.
Construction and characteristics
Kommandren was one of four passenger/cargo steamships built for Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards around the turn of the 20th century. The four ships were constructed to supplement four smaller vessels built decades earlier at British shipyards. In addition to Kommandren, which was seen as the flag ship of the company's fleet, Lrdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.Torvanger 2000, p. 30Torvanger 2000, p. 58
Delivered on 30 June 1891, Kommandren was yard number 132 at Aker company Akers Mekaniske Vrksted in Oslo Kristiania modern-day Oslo, Norway. The steel-hulled ship displaced GRT 433 first=yes, had a length of convert 50.8 m ft, a Beam nautical beam of convert 7.5 m ft and a Draft hull draught of convert 3.9 m ft. Her 600 indicated horsepower/116 nominal horsepower 3-cylinder triple expansion steam engine could propel the ship at convert 12 kn.csr register=MSI id=5600264 shipname=Kommandoren  accessdate=15 April 2013Cite web last=Lawson  first =Siri Holm  url=http://www.warsailors.com/homefleetsingles/kommandoren.html  title=D/S Kommandren  accessdate=15 April 2013  work=Warsailors.com  publisher=  date=  Kommandren cost the company NOK 264,000 to build and could take up to 249 passengers.
Although much newer than the first ships operated by Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe, Kommandren and the three other ships were only around convert 2 kn faster than the mid-19th century vessels used by the company.Frsund 1998, p. 163
The new ship was named Kommandren by Nordre Bergenhus amt county council, after the affectionate nickname of the county's shipping company's first executive director, Hugo Lous, who had held the rank of kommandrkaptein lang-en  commander in the Royal Norwegian Navy.Frsund 1998, p. 35Torvanger 2000, p. 59 To name the new ship after the executive director was an unusual decision, as most Norwegian ships of the era were named after place names, historical figures or royalty.Kolltveit 1982, p. 58 
Built not only to carry people and cargo between the towns and villages of Western Norway, but also for the tourist trade, Kommandren was fitted with a comparatively luxurious first class section. The 10-cabin, 36-bed, first class featured a smoking salon, a women's salon and a dining salon for the first class passengers and ship officers. A promenade deck gave views in all directions. The third class passengers had two salons, one on the main deck and one on the orlop lowest deck. On Kommandren, the third class section was expanded and improved in comparison with earlier vessels, after complaints from passengers to the county council.Torvanger 2000, p. 60 The third class section of Kommandren was described by the newspaper Sogns Tidende as large, spacious and almost comfortably equipped.cite web  url=http://www.sfj.no/cmssff/cmspublish.nsf/print/348DB9B38492862EC12578CC003D6396?OpenDocument  title=Kommandren i Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane  author=Hermund Kleppa  year=2011  work=Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality  publisher=  accessdate=15 April 2013  language=Norwegian Kommandren was home ported in Bergen.Nordanger 1975, p. 422 She had her maiden passenger voyage from Bergen to Sogn on 5 July 1891.
Passenger/cargo and tourist service

In the summer season, Kommandren served the tourist trade in Sogn, while she sailed the regular passenger/cargo routes during the winter months. Kommandren was generally used as an express route ship, often carrying patients on their way to treatment.Torvanger 2000, pp.&nbsp;6061 Amongst the cargo carried by was often live animals, including horses, cattle and sheep.Frsund 1998, p. 20 During one of her trips, Kommandren ran aground on 20 October 1900 near Tjugum in Balestrand.Frsund 1998, p. 106 The ship was also at times employed to transport important dignitaries in the region, like she did in September 1920, when she brought politicians to Vik to inspect the area for a proposed railway project.Frsund 1998, p. 115 Shortly after delivery, in September 1892, Kommandren provided transport support to a large-scale Norwegian Army field exercise in Western Norway. She was tasked with transporting troops from Gudvangen to Lrdalsyri after the completion of the exercises.NN 1893, p. 35
In 1910, Kommandren was modernized at Stavanger Stberi & Dok in Stavanger, gaining a new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white. In January the next year, she ran aground at Rongevr in the Fensfjord. She ran aground again in 1913, in Herdlefjorden, and again in Brdsundet off Tysnesy in 1928.Torvanger 2000, p. 61 
A rebuild in 1922 saw the ship's well deck built over, creating a flush deck profile. In 1930 the ship was refurbished and modernized. By this time, Kommandren displaced a total of GRT 543 NRT 315.cite web  url=http://minnehallen.no/skip_2/kommandoren-ds  title=DS.

Kommandren ran aground yet again in April 1938, when she ran into the island Seglya while en route from Skjerjehamn to Eivindvik. The incident caused severe damage to the bottom of the Hull watercraft hull.
Second World War
Norwegian Campaign
=Troop ship=
When Norway was Operation Weserbung invaded by Nazi Germany on 9 April, Kommandren was not in the areas immediately captured by the invading Germans. She was thus able to continue her service in the Sognefjord for much of the month of April 1940. On 9 April 1940, Kommandren was en route to Bergen, but was stopped at Hyanger and ordered to Sogn to assist in the mobilization of Norwegian Army units to Norwegian Campaign oppose the Germans.Svartefoss 1994, p. 22Torvanger 2000, p. 62 
Kommandren was directed to transport troops from Dingja via several smaller villages to Nordeide and Gudvangen. Together with the steamer SS Gudvangen  2, she set out in the early morning of 10 April to retrieve troops. Kommandren and the other ships of the company fleet were later praised by the regional police commander for their important role in the successful mobilization in Sogn og Fjordane.Svartefoss 1994, p. 23
=Bombing in the Sognefjord=
On 25 April 1940, Kommandren steamed in the Sognefjord, carrying regular passengers, as well as a load of around 100 soldiers bound for Gudvangen and Voss for service with the Norwegian Army's 4th Division Norway 4th Division. The soldiers brought in that day belonged to an older age group not called up in the initial mobilization drive. While en route from Vik to Balestrand, the steamer was bombed and Strafing strafed by a German bomber. The bombs did not hit the ship, and the machine gun bullets only did minor damage and caused no casualties.Svartefoss 1994, p. 47
After calling at Balestrand, Kommandren proceeded to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked. While Kommandren was docked at Leikanger, the village was attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvg from Kommandren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. While on the way to hospital in Lrdal with Kommandren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.Svartefoss 1994, pp.&nbsp;4850cite encyclopedia  first=  last=  authorlink=   encyclopedia=NRK Sogn og Fjordane Fylkesleksikon  title=Bombing og dd p Hermansverk  editor=Hans-Tore Bjerkaas  url=http://www.nrk.no/sf/leksikon/index.php/Bombing_og_d%C3%B8d_p%C3%A5_Hermansverk  accessdate=15 April 2013   year=  publisher=NRK  location=  isbn=  pages=  language=Norwegian 
=End of the campaign=
For the remaining week of the fighting in South Norway, Kommandren was docked at Kvamsya, immobilized by a damaged axle. As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, Kommandren was to be handed over to the Germans, along with the ferry MF Lrdal 1939 Lrdal and 40 smaller boats. The transfer of the ships occurred at Lrdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used Kommandren and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.Svartefoss 1994, pp.&nbsp;5154
When released by the Germans, Kommandren was repaired before re-entering service.
During the German occupation
By the autumn of 1940, Kommandren was back in regular service, providing an important link between Bergen and the smaller town and villages in the region. By 1944, Kommandren had been assigned the code letters LEGO.
She remained in service until 8 February 1945, when she ran aground in the Alverstraumen narrows. Kommandren remained aground for five weeks, and was filled by sea water before being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs. Although the ship's hull was intact, the interior and engine were heavily water damaged.Torvanger 2000, p. 63
Sinking
During the night of 29 March 1945, Kommandren was docked at the remains of Sndre Nykirkekai in Bergen.#tag:ref Most of the quay Sndre Nykirkekai had been destroyed in the 1944 Vgen explosion less than a year previously.Torvanger 2000, p. 51 group=Note At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat anchored on the opposite side of Vgen, Bergen Vgen bay.Voks 1994, p. 511 The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water. The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.cite encyclopedia  first=  last=  authorlink=   encyclopedia=NRK Sogn og Fjordane Fylkesleksikon  title=Alf H. Larsen  editor=Hans-Tore Bjerkaas  url=http://www.nrk.no/sf/leksikon/index.php/Alf_H._Larsen  accessdate=15 April 2013   year=  publisher=NRK  location=  isbn=  pages=  language=Norwegian 
Before discovering that the incident had been caused by the accidental launch of two torpedoes by a drunken German crewman on the E-boat S-13, the German authorities in Bergen launched a search for saboteurs in the city. Kommandren was the only total loss suffered by Fylkesbaatane i Sogn og Fjordane the formerly named Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe during the Second World War.
The wreck of Kommandren was raised in April 1946 and towed to Kjkkelvik in Asky. Kommandren was sold for scrap in November 1946.
