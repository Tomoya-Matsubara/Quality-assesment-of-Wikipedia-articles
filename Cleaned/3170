The chemical compound chemical substance hydrochloric acid is the aqueous Water molecule water-based solution of hydrogen chloride Hydrogen HChlorine Cl gas. It is a strong acid, the major component of gastric acid and of wide industrial use. As a highly corrosive liquid, hydrochloric acid should be handled only with appropriate safety precautions. 
Hydrochloric acid, or muriatic acid by its historical but still occasionally used name, has been an important and frequently-used chemical from early history, and was discovered by the alchemy alchemist Geber Jabir ibn Hayyan around the year 800. It was used throughout the Middle Ages by alchemists in the quest for the philosopher's stone, and later by several European scientists including Johann Rudolf Glauber Glauber, Joseph Priestley Priestley, and Humphry Davy Davy, to help establish modern chemical knowledge.
During the Industrial Revolution, it became an important industrial chemical for many applications, including the large-scale production of organic chemistry organic compounds, such as vinyl chloride for polyvinyl chloride PVC plastic and Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate MDI/Toluene diisocyanate TDI for polyurethane, and smaller-scale applications, such as production of gelatin and other cooking ingredients in food, and leather processing.  At present, production is approximately 20 million metric tonnes annually 20 Mt/a of HCl gas.
History
Hydrochloric acid was first discovered around the year 800 by the Alchemy alchemist Geber Jabir ibn Hayyan Geber, by mixing Sodium chloride common salt with vitriol sulfuric acid. Jabir discovered or invented many important chemicals, and wrote his findings in over twenty books, which carried his chemical knowledge of hydrochloric acid and other basic chemicals for hundreds of years. Jabir's invention of the gold-dissolving aqua regia, consisting of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid, contributed to the effort of alchemists trying to find the philosopher's stone.

In&nbsp;the Middle Ages, hydrochloric acid was known to European alchemists as spirit of salt or acidum salis. Gaseous HCl was called marine acid air. The old pre-systematic name systematic name muriatic acid has the same origin muriatic means pertaining to brine or salt, and this name is still sometimes used. Notable production was recorded by Basilius Valentinus, the alchemist-Canon priest canon of the Benedictine priory Sankt Peter in Erfurt Erfurt, Germany in the fifteenth century. 
In the seventeenth century, Johann Rudolf Glauber from Karlstadt am Main Karlstadt am Main, Germany used salt sodium chloride and sulfuric acid for the preparation of sodium sulfate, releasing hydrogen chloride gas. Joseph Priestley from Leeds, England prepared pure hydrogen chloride in 1772, and in 1818 Humphry Davy from Penzance, England proved that the chemical composition included hydrogen and chlorine. 
During the Industrial Revolution in Europe, demand for alkaline substances, such as soda ash increased, and the new industrial soda-process by Nicolas Leblanc Issoudun Issoundun, France enabled cheap large-scale production. In the Leblanc process, salt is converted to soda ash, using sulfuric acid, limestone, and coal, releasing hydrogen chloride as a by-product. Until the Alkali Act of 1863, excess HCl was vented to the air. After the passage of the act, soda ash producers were obliged to absorb the waste gas in water, producing hydrochloric acid on an industrial scale.
When early in the twentieth century the Leblanc process was effectively replaced by the Solvay process without hydrochloric acid by-product, hydrochloric acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications. The commercial interest initiated other production methods which are still used today, as described below. Today, most hydrochloric acid is made by absorbing hydrogen chloride from Hydrochloric acid#Production industrial organic compounds production.
Hydrochloric acid is listed as a Table II precursor under the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances because of its use in the production of heroin and cocaine http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf.
Chemistry
Image:Titration.gif frame left 70px Acid titration
Hydrogen chloride HCl is a monoprotic acid, which can Dissociation_chemistry dissociate i.e., ionize only once to give up one H+ ion a single proton. In aqueous hydrochloric acid, the H+ joins a water molecule to form a hydronium ion, H3O+:
:: HCl + H2O &rarr; H3O+ + Cl
The other ion formed is Cl or Chloride chloride ion. Hydrochloric acid can therefore be used to prepare salts called chlorides, such as sodium chloride.  Hydrochloric acid is considered a strong acid, since it is practically fully dissociated in water.
Image:HCl molecule model-VdW surface.png 115px thumb Molecular model of hydrogen chloride.
Monoprotic acids have one acid dissociation constant, Ka, which indicates the level of dissociation in water.  For a strong acid like HCl, Ka is large. Theoretical attempts to assign a Ka to HCl have been made; see http://www.chembuddy.com/?left=BATE&right=dissociation_constants. When chloride salts such as NaCl are added to aqueous HCl they have practically no effect on pH, indicating that Cl is an exceedingly weak conjugate base and that HCl is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For intermediate to strong solutions of hydrochloric acid, the assumption that H+ molarity a unit of concentration equals HCl molarity is excellent, agreeing to four significant digits. 
Of the seven common strong acids in chemistry, all of them inorganic, hydrochloric acid is the monoprotic acid least likely to undergo an interfering redox oxidation-reduction reaction. It is one of the least-hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it produces the less-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus the fact that it is available as a pure reagent, means that hydrochloric acid makes an excellent acidifying reagent and acid titrant for determining the amount of an unknown quantity of base chemistry base in titration. Strong acid titrants are useful because they give more distinct endpoints in a titration, making the titration more precise. Hydrochloric acid is frequently used in chemical analysis and to digest samples for analysis. Concentrated hydrochloric acid will dissolve some metals to form oxidized metal chlorides and hydrogen gas. It will produce metal chlorides from base_chemistry basic compounds such as calcium carbonate or copperII oxide. It is also used as a simple acid catalyst for some chemical reactions.
;Physical properties
The physical property physical properties of hydrochloric acid, such as boiling point boiling and melting points, density, and pH depend on the concentration or molarity of HCl in the acid solution. They can range from those of water at 0% HCl to values for fuming hydrochloric acid at over 40% HCl.

Hydrochloric acid as the binary two-component mixture of HCl and H2O has a constant-boiling point boiling azeotrope at 20.2% HCl and 108.6 C 227 F. There are four constant-crystallization eutectic eutectic points for hydrochloric acid, between the crystal form of HCl&middot;H2O 68% HCl, HCl&middot;2H2O 51% HCl, HCl&middot;3H2O 41% HCl, HCl&middot;6H2O 25% HCl, and of course ice 0% HCl. There is also a metastable eutectic at 24.8% between ice and the HCl&middot;3H2O crystallization.
 Production 
image:hclplant-udl.jpg frame Hydrochloric acid oven
 Direct synthesis 
The large scale production of hydrochloric acid is almost always integrated with other industrial scale chemical production. In the chloralkali process chlor-alkali industry, sodium chloride salt solution is electrolysis electrolyzed producing chlorine, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen. The pure chlorine gas can be re-combined with the hydrogen gas, forming chemically pure HCl gas. As the reaction is exothermic reaction exothermic, the installation is called an HCl oven. 
:: Cl2 + H2 &rarr; 2HCl
The resulting pure hydrogen chloride gas is absorption absorbed in ion exchange resin#Water softening demineralized water, resulting in chemically pure hydrochloric acid.
Organic synthesis
The largest production of hydrochloric acid is integrated with the formation of chlorination chlorinated and fluorine fluorinated organic chemistry organic compounds, e.g., Teflon, Freon and other CFCs, chloro-acetic acid, and polyvinyl chloride PVC. Often this production of hydrochloric acid is integrated with captive use of it on-site. In the chemical reactions, hydrogen atoms are replaced by chlorine atoms, whereupon the released hydrogen atom re-combines with the spare atom from the chlorine molecule, forming hydrogen chloride. Fluorination is a subsequent chlorine-replacement reaction, producing again hydrogen chloride.
:: R-H + Cl2 &rarr; R-Cl + HCl
:: R-Cl + HF &rarr; R-F + HCl
The resulting hydrogen chloride gas is either re-used directly, or absorbed in water, resulting in hydrochloric acid of technical or industrial grade.
Industrial market
Hydrochloric acid is produced in solutions up to 38% HCl concentrated grade. Higher concentrations up to just over 40% are chemically possible, but the evaporation rate is then so high that storage and handling need extra precautions, such as pressure and low temperature. Bulk industrial-grade is therefore 30% to 34%, optimized for effective transport and limited product loss by HCl vapours. Solutions for household purposes, mostly cleaning, are typically 10% to 12%, with strong recommendations to dilute before use.
Major producers worldwide include Dow Chemical Company Dow Chemical at 2 million metric tonnes annually 2&nbsp;Mt/year, calculated as HCl gas, and Formosa Plastics FMC, Georgia Gulf Georgia Gulf Corporation, Tosoh Tosoh Corporation, Akzo Nobel, and Tessenderlo at 0.5 to 1.5 Mt/year each. Total world production, for comparison purposes expressed as HCl, is estimated at 20 Mt/year, with 3 Mt/year from direct synthesis, and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses. By far, most of all hydrochloric acid is consumed captively by the producer. The open world market size is estimated at 5 Mt/year.
Applications
Hydrochloric acid is a strong inorganic acid that is used in many industrial processes. The application often determines the required product quality.
Regeneration of ion exchangers
An important application of high-quality hydrochloric acid is the regeneration of ion exchange resins. Ion exchange Cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing ion exchange resin#Water softening demineralized water.
:: Na+ is replaced by H3O+
:: Ca2+ is replaced by 2H3O+
Ion exchangers and demineralized water are used in all chemical industries, drinking water production, and many food industries.
pH Control and neutralization
A very common application of hydrochloric acid is to regulate the basicity pH of solutions. 
:: OH + HCl  H2O + Cl
In industry demanding purity food, pharmaceutical, drinking water, high-quality hydrochloric acid is used to control the pH of process water streams. In less-demanding industry, technical-quality hydrochloric acid suffices for acid-base reaction theories neutralizing waste streams and swimming pool treatment.
Pickling of steel
Pickling metal Pickling is an essential step in metal surface treatment, to remove rust or iron oxide scale from iron or steel before subsequent processing, such as extrusion, rolling, galvanization galvanizing, and other techniques. Technical-quality HCl at typically 18% concentration is the most commonly-used pickling agent for the pickling of carbon steel grades.
:: Fe2O3 + Fe + 6HCl &rarr; 3FeCl2 + 3H2O
The spent acid has long been re-used as ferrous chloride solutions, but high heavy metals heavy-metal levels in the pickling liquor has decreased this practice.
In recent years, the steel pickling industry has however developed hydrochloric acid regeneration processes, such as the spray roaster or the fluidised bed HCl regeneration process, which allow the recovery of HCl from spent pickling liquor. These are two Pyrohydrolysis http://www.acreg.com ACREG Processes. The most common regeneration process is the http://www.acreg.com ACREG http://www.dependeq.com Dependeq http://www.astec-engineering.com ASTEC - Process, applying the following formula:
:: 4FeCl2 + 4H2O + O2 &rarr; 8HCl+ 2Fe2O3
By this means, a closed acid loop is established. The ferric oxide by product of the regeneration process is a valuable by-product, used in a variety of secondary industries.
HCl is not a common pickling agent for stainless steel grades.
Production of inorganic compounds
Numerous products can be produced with hydrochloric acid in normal Acid-base reaction theories acid-base reactions, resulting in inorganic compounds. These include water treatment chemicals such as ironIII chloride and Aluminium chlorohydrate polyaluminium chloride PAC.
:: Fe2O3 + 6 HCl &rarr; 2 FeCl3 + 3 H2O
Both ironIII chloride and PAC are used as flocculation and coagulation agents in wastewater#treatment wastewater treatment, drinking water production, and paper production.
Other inorganic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include road application salt calcium chloride, nickelII chloride for electroplating, and zinc chloride for the galvanizing industry and battery electricity battery production.
Production of organic compounds
The largest hydrochloric acid consumption is in the production of organic compounds such as vinyl chloride for polyvinyl chloride PVC, and Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate MDI and Toluene diisocyanate TDI for polyurethane. This is often captive use, consuming locally-produced hydrochloric acid that never actually reaches the open market. Other organic chemistry organic compounds produced with hydrochloric acid include bisphenol A for polycarbonate, activated carbon, and ascorbic acid, as well as numerous pharmaceutical products.
Other applications
Hydrochloric acid is a fundamental chemical, and as such it is used for a large number of small-scale applications, such as leather processing, household cleaning, and building construction. In addition, a way of stimulating petroleum#Extraction oil production is by injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil-well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.
Many chemical reactions involving hydrochloric acid are applied in the production of food, food ingredients, and food additives. Typical products include aspartame, fructose, citric acid, lysine, hydrolyzed  vegetable protein as food enhancer, and in gelatin production. Food-grade extra-pure hydrochloric acid can be applied when needed for the final product.
Hydrochloric acid and living organisms
Physiology and pathology
Hydrochloric acid constitutes the majority of gastric acid, the human digestive fluid. In a complex process and at a large energetic burden, it is secreted by parietal cells also known as oxyntic cells. These cells contain an extensive secretory network called canaliculi from which the HCl is secreted into the lumen of the stomach. They are part of the epithelium epithelial fundic glands also known as oxyntic glands in the stomach.
Safety mechanisms that prevent the damage of the epithelium of digestive tract by hydrochloric acid are the following:
 Negative regulators of its release
 A thick mucus layer covering the epithelium
 Sodium bicarbonate secreted by gastric epithelial cells and pancreas
 The structure of epithelium tight junctions
 Adequate blood supply
 Prostaglandins many different effects: they stimulate mucus and bicarbonate secretion, maintain epithelial barrier integrity, enable adequate blood supply, stimulate the healing of the damaged mucous membrane
When, due to different reasons, these mechanisms fail, heartburn or peptic ulcers can develop. Drugs called proton pump inhibitors prevent the body from making excess acid in the stomach, while antacids neutralize existing acid. 
In some instances, not enough of hydrochloric acid gets produced in the stomach. These pathologic states are denoted by the terms hypochlorhydria and achlorhydria. Potentially they can lead to gastroenteritis.
Chemical weapons
Phosgene COCl2 was a common chemical warfare agent used in World War I. The main effect of phosgene results from the dissolution of the gas in the mucous membranes deep in the lung, where it is converted by hydrolysis into carbonic acid and the corrosive hydrochloric acid. The latter disrupts the pulmonary alveolus alveolar-capillary biological membrane membranes so that the lung becomes filled with fluid pulmonary edema. 
Hydrochloric acid is also partly responsible for the harmful or blistering effects of mustard gas.  In the presence of water, such as on the moist surface of the eyes or lungs, mustard gas breaks down forming hydrochloric acid.

Hydrochloric acid in high concentrations forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, potentially damaging respiratory organs, eyes, skin and intestines. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite bleach NaClO or potassium permanganate permanganate KMnO4, the toxic gas chlorine is produced. To minimize the risks while working with hydrochloric acid, appropriate precautions should be taken. For example, water should never be added to the concentrated acid, as the water could boil; rather, acid should be added to water. See references for details.
The hazards of solutions of hydrochloric acid depend on the concentration. The following table lists the Directive 67/548/EEC EU classification of hydrochloric acid solutions:
