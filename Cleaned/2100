The Eastern Moa, Emeus crassus, is an extinct species of ratite bird belonging to the moa family. It is nowadays recognized as the only species of the genus Emeus.
Emeus was of average size, standing 1.5-1.8 m (5 ft) tall. Like other moa, it had vestigial wing bones, hair-like feathers (beige in this case), a long neck and large, powerful legs with very short, strong tarsi. Its feet were exceptionally wide compared to other moas, making it a very slow creature. Soft parts of its body, such as tracheal rings (cartilage) or remnants of skin were found, as well as single bones and complete skeletongs. As they neared the head, the feathers grew shorter, until they finally turned into coarse hair; the head itself was probably bald.
Human colonists hunted Emeus into extinction with relative ease. Like almost all moa, it was gone by the year 1500.
It has been long suspected that the &quot;species&quot; described as Emeus huttonii and E. crassus were males and females, respectively, of a single species. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material; the females of E. crassus were 15-25% larger than males (Huynen et al., 2003). This phenomenon &lt;U+2014&gt; reverse size dimorphism &lt;U+2014&gt; is not uncommon amongst ratites, being also very pronounced in kiwis.
