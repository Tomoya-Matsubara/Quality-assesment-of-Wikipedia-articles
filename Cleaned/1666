Ren&lt;U+00E9&gt; Bourque (pronounced reh-NAY BOHRK) (born December 10, 1981) is a professional ice hockey left winger who currently plays for the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL). An undrafted player, Bourque was signed by the Chicago Blackhawks as a free agent in 2004 after spending four years at the University of Wisconsin&lt;U+2013&gt;Madison. He began his professional career with the Norfolk Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL) where he won Rookie of the Year honours in 2005. He joined the Blackhawks to start the 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 NHL season and spent three years in Chicago before a 2008 trade sent him to Calgary.
Playing career
Bourque was recruited to play Major-Junior hockey for the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL), though he declined to join the Blades as it would have cost him his eligibility to play for a National Collegiate Athletic Association school.1 He opted instead to play one season of junior-A hockey with the St. Albert Saints of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), finishing with 44 goals and 81 points to finish second in team scoring in 1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000. He was named to the AJHL All-Rookie team and finished as a runner-up for the Rookie of the Year award.2 Although the Saints finished last in the league, he earned a scholarship to play for the University of Wisconsin&lt;U+2013&gt;Madison.3 He played four years between 2000&lt;U+2013&gt;2004 for the Wisconsin Badgers, scoring 57 goals in 153 games and serving as a co-captain of the team in his senior year.4
Upon graduating, Bourque signed a free agent contract with the Chicago Blackhawks.5 He was assigned to the Hawks' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, for the 2004&lt;U+2013&gt;05 season. He scored a franchise record 33 goals for the Admirals, also leading the team with 60 points.6 He was named the Dudley &quot;Red&quot; Garrett Memorial Award winner as the AHL's rookie of the year,7 made the All-Rookie Team and played for team Canada at the 2005 AHL All-Star Game where he won the hardest shot competition.8
Bourque joined the Blackhawks to start the 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 season, and scored his first NHL goal in his first game, a 5&lt;U+2013&gt;3 loss to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.9 He finished his rookie season with 16 goals and 34 points,10 good for fourth place in team scoring.11 The Hawks subsequently signed Bourque to a two-year contract extension.12 He endured an injury plagued season in 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07, appearing in only 44 games and scoring seven goals.13 He was rushed to hospital during a November 12, 2006, game against the Columbus Blue Jackets after he suffered a deep cut to the neck from Nikolai Zherdev's skate during a scrum in the crease.14 The Blackhawks announced that he would miss 3&lt;U+2013&gt;6 weeks following surgery to repair the laceration.15 Bourque considered himself fortunate that the injury was not worse, stating upon his return to action four weeks later that he might not have survived if the cut was a couple millimetres deeper.16
Just over two weeks after his return, Bourque was again sidelined when he suffered a cracked bone in his ankle on New Year's Eve.17 He returned to action on February 21 after missing nearly two months.18 Injuries again hampered Bourque in 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;08. He missed time early in the season with a groin pull,19 then was knocked out of the lineup for a month after breaking his thumb in a November game against the Detroit Red Wings.20 He remained healthy upon his return, finishing the season with ten goals and 14 assists in 62 games for Chicago.21
The Calgary Flames acquired Bourque from Chicago in exchange for a second round selection at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft on July 1, 2008.22 Calgary quickly signed the restricted free agent to a two-year contract.23 He enjoyed a career year in Calgary that included his first hat trick against the Ottawa Senators on December 27, 2008.24 He suffered a high ankle sprain that sidelined him for the final two months of the regular season.25 Although he was limited to 55 games, he topped the 20-goal plateau for the first time (21) and scored a career high 40 points.26 He returned in time to play in the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the Blackhawks, though he re-aggrivated the injury.27 Following the season, he opted for surgery to repair the damage to his ankle.28
Bourque continued to provide offence for the Flames early in 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;10; he was leading the Flames in scoring in late November when he was again knocked out of the lineup by an undisclosed injury.29 He returned to action after two weeks, having missed six games.30
