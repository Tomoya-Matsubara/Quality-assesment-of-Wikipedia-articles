}} }} Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States. He is the first African American to hold the office. Obama previously served as a United States Senator from Illinois, from January 2005 until he resigned after his election to the presidency in November 2008.
A native of Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was the president of the Harvard Law Review. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney in Chicago and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004.
Obama served three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid against a Democratic incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, he ran for United States Senate in 2004.1 Several events brought him to national attention during the campaign, including his victory in the March 2004 Democratic primary and his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He won election to the U.S. Senate in November 2004. His presidential campaign began in February 2007, and after a close campaign in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he won his party's nomination. In the 2008 general election, he defeated Republican nominee John McCain and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009.
As president, Obama signed economic stimulus legislation in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009. Other domestic policy initiatives include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act &lt;U+2013&gt; a major piece of health care reform legislation which he signed into law in March 2010 &lt;U+2013&gt; and the Dodd&lt;U+2013&gt;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which forms part of his financial regulatory reform efforts, which he signed in July 2010. In foreign policy, Obama gradually withdrew combat troops from Iraq, increased troop levels in Afghanistan, and signed an arms control treaty with Russia. On October 9, 2009, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Early life and career
Obama was born August 4, 1961, at Kapi'olani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii.23 His mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, was born in Wichita, Kansas, of mostly English, some German,456 and Irish descent. His great-great-great grandfather hailed from County Offaly.7 His father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a Luo from Nyang&lt;U+2019&gt;oma Kogelo, Nyanza Province, Kenya. Obama is the first President to have been born in Hawaii.89 Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at M&lt;U+0101&gt;noa, where his father was a foreign student on scholarship.1011 The couple married on February 2, 1961,12 but separated when Obama Sr. went to Harvard University on scholarship, and divorced in 1964.13 Obama Sr. remarried and returned to Kenya, visiting Barack in Hawaii only once, in 1971. He died in an automobile accident in 1982.
After her divorce, Dunham married Indonesian student Lolo Soetoro, who was attending college in Hawaii. When Suharto, a military leader in Soetoro's home country, came to power in 1967, all Indonesian students studying abroad were recalled, and the family moved to the Menteng neighborhood of Jakarta.1415 From ages six to ten, Obama attended local schools in Jakarta, including Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School.1617
In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Armour Dunham, and attended Punahou School, a private college preparatory school, from the fifth grade until his graduation from high school in 1979.
Obama (1995, 2004), Chapters 3 and 4. Obama's mother returned to Hawaii in 1972, remaining there until 1977 when she went back to Indonesia to work as an anthropological field worker. She finally returned to Hawaii in 1994 and lived there for one year, before dying of ovarian cancer.

The adults wear sunglasses and the boy wears sandals.|Barack Obama and half-sister Maya Soetoro, with their mother Ann Dunham and grandfather Stanley Dunham, in Hawaii (early 1970s)
Of his early childhood, Obama recalled, &quot;That my father looked nothing like the people around me&lt;U+2014&gt;that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk&lt;U+2014&gt;barely registered in my mind.&quot;18 He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.Obama (1995), Chapters 4 and 5.
 Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: &quot;The opportunity that Hawaii offered&lt;U+2014&gt;to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect&lt;U+2014&gt;became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.&quot;19 Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana and cocaine during his teenage years to &quot;push questions of who I was out of my mind.&quot;
In Dreams from My Father, Obama writes: &quot;Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it.&quot; Obama (1995), pp. 93&lt;U+2013&gt;94.
For analysis of the political impact of the quote and Obama's more recent admission that he smoked marijuana as a teenager (&quot;When I was a kid, I inhaled&quot;), see:
 At the 2008 Civil Forum on the Presidency, Obama identified his high-school drug use as a great moral failure.20
Following high school, Obama moved to Los Angeles in 1979 to attend Occidental College.21 In February 1981, he made his first public speech, calling for Occidental's divestment from South Africa.22 In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in India and Pakistan for three weeks.23
Later in 1981 he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations24 and graduated with a B.A. in 1983. He worked for a year at the Business International Corporation,2526 then at the New York Public Interest Research Group.2728
Chicago community organizer and Harvard Law School
After four years in New York City, Obama was hired in Chicago as director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Greater Roseland (Roseland, West Pullman and Riverdale) on Chicago's far South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.29

Mendell (2007), pp. 63&lt;U+2013&gt;83. During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from one to thirteen and its annual budget grew from  to . He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.
 Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.

 In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.30 He returned in August 2006 for a visit to his father's birthplace, a village near Kisumu in rural western Kenya.31
In late 1988, Obama entered Harvard Law School. He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,
Mendell (2007), pp. 80&lt;U+2013&gt;92. and president of the journal in his second year.
 During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990.32 After graduating with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) magna cum laude33 from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.34 Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention35 and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,36 which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.37
University of Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney
In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.38 He then served as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years&lt;U+2014&gt;as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004&lt;U+2014&gt;teaching constitutional law.
From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration drive with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, and led to Crain's Chicago Business naming Obama to its 1993 list of &quot;40 under Forty&quot; powers to be.39 In 1993 he joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2002.40
From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and of the Joyce Foundation.41 He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.42
Legislative career: 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2008
State Senator: 1997&lt;U+2013&gt;2004
Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding State Senator Alice Palmer as Senator from Illinois's 13th District, which at that time spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park &lt;U+2013&gt; Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn.43 Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation reforming ethics and health care laws.44 He sponsored a law increasing tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.45 In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.46
Obama was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002.47 In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary run for the U.S. House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.48
In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.49 He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.5051 During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.52 Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.53
U.S. Senate campaign
In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race; he created a campaign committee, began raising funds and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002, and formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.54
Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.55 On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War,56 Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally,57 and spoke out against the war.58 He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd that &quot;it's not too late&quot; to stop the war.59
Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to contest the race resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates.60 In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide&lt;U+2014&gt;which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father.61
In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts,62 and it was seen by 9.1 million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.63
Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.
Mendell (2007), pp. 260&lt;U+2013&gt;271. Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan.64 In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.65
U.S. Senator: 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2008
 Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 4, 2005,66 at which time he became the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus.67 CQ Weekly characterized him as a &quot;loyal Democrat&quot; based on analysis of all Senate votes in 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;2007. The National Journal ranked him among the &quot;most liberal&quot; senators during 2005 through 200768 (the ranking has been criticized by liberal groups such as Media Matters for America6970). He enjoyed high popularity as senator with a 72% approval in Illinois.71 Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.72
Legislation
Senate bill sponsors Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Obama discussing the Coburn&lt;U+2013&gt;Obama Transparency Act73
Obama cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.74 He introduced two initiatives bearing his name: Lugar&lt;U+2013&gt;Obama, which expanded the Nunn&lt;U+2013&gt;Lugar cooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons,75 and the Coburn&lt;U+2013&gt;Obama Transparency Act, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.76 On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama, along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain, introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.77
Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.78 Regarding tort reform, Obama voted for the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.79 
In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.80 In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.81 Obama also introduced Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act, a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,82 and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007,83 neither of which has been signed into law.
Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges.84 This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.85 He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee, and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.86 Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.87
Committees
Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works and Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.88 In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.89 He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on European Affairs.90 As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian Authority, and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi condemning corruption within the Kenyan government.91
Presidential campaign: 2008
 On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for president of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.929394 The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic9596 because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic &quot;House Divided&quot; speech in 1858.97 Throughout the campaign, Obama emphasized the issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence and providing universal health care.

A large number of candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.98 On June 3, with all states counted, Obama was named the presumptive nominee99 and delivered a victory speech in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed him on June 7, 2008.100
Obama proceeded to focus on the general election campaign against Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, in the lead up to the Democratic National Convention. He announced on August 23, 2008, that he had selected Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.101 At the convention, held August 25 to August 28 in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her delegates and supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in support of Obama.102 Obama delivered his acceptance speech to a crowd of over 75,000 at Invesco Field at Mile High103 and presented his policy goals; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.104 
During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.105 On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.106
After McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, three presidential debates were held between the contenders spanning September and October 2008.107 On November 4, Obama won the presidency by winning 365 electoral votes to 173 that McCain received,108 in the process capturing 52.9% of the popular vote to McCain's 45.7%,109 to become the first African American
 to be elected president. Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.110
Presidency
First days
The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President, and Joe Biden as Vice President, took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq,111 and ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp &quot;as soon as practicable and no later than&quot; January 2010.112 Obama also reduced the secrecy given to presidential records113 and changed procedures to promote disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.114 The president also reversed George W. Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign establishments that allow abortions.115
Domestic policy
 The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.116 Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4 million children currently uninsured.117
In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy which had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research. Obama stated that he believed &quot;sound science and moral values...are not inconsistent&quot; and pledged to develop &quot;strict guidelines&quot; on the research.118
Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. Sonia Sotomayor, nominated by Obama on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter, was confirmed on August 6, 2009,119 becoming the first Hispanic to be a Supreme Court Justice.120 Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three, for the first time in American history.121
On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.122123
On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expands the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.124125126
On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a reconciliation bill which ends the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increases the Pell Grant scholarship award, and makes changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.127128129130
In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of manned spaceflight to the moon and ended development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program. He is focusing funding (which is expected to rise modestly) on Earth science projects and a new rocket type, as well as research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars. Missions to the International Space Station are expected to continue until 2020.131
Economic policy
On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.132 The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals,133 which is being distributed over the course of several years.
 In March, Obama's Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2 trillion in depreciated real estate assets.134 Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry135 in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat136 and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government shouldering a 12% stake.137 In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.138 He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot;, that had mixed results.139140141
Although spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department authorized by the Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5 trillion, only $3 trillion had actually been spent by the end of November 2009.142 However, Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predict that the 2010 budget deficit will be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.143144 For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will slightly shrink to $1.34, while the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53 trillion or 80% of GDP.145
Unemployment numbers rose briefly to as high as 10.1% in October 2009 (the highest since 1983)146 before decreasing to 9.5% in June 2010.147 In the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. economy expanded at a 2.7% pace148 after growing at its fastest rate in six years in the fourth quarter, 5.7%.149 In July 2010, the Federal Reserve expressed that although economic activity continued to increase, its pace had slowed and its Chairman, Ben Bernanke, stated that the economic outlook was &quot;unusually uncertain.&quot;150
The Congressional Budget Office and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.151152 The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1&lt;U+2013&gt;2.1 million,153154155156 while conceding that &quot;It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.&quot;157 Although an April 2010 survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of the 68 respondents believed that the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.158
Health care reform
Barack Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010.
Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.159 He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.160161
On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.162 After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over his administration's proposals.163
On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.164165 On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill&lt;U+2014&gt;without a public option&lt;U+2014&gt;on a party-line vote of 60&lt;U+2013&gt;39.166 On March 21, 2010, the health care bill passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.167 Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.168
Gulf of Mexico oil spill
On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. The well's operator, BP, initiated a containment and cleanup plan, and began drilling two relief wells intended to stop the flow. Obama visited the Gulf on May 2 among visits by members of his cabinet, and again on May 28 and June 4. He began a federal investigation and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. On May 27, he announced a 6-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.169 As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.170171172173174
Foreign policy
  In February and March, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a &quot;new era&quot; in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms &quot;break&quot; and &quot;reset&quot; to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.175 Obama's granting of his first television interview as president to an Arabic cable network, Al Arabiya, was seen as an attempt to reach out to Arab leaders.176
On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.177 This attempt at outreach was rebuffed by the Iranian leadership.178 In April, Obama gave a speech in Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.179 On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for &quot;a new beginning&quot; in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.180  On June 26, 2009, in response to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following Iran's 2009 presidential election, Obama said: &quot;The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.&quot;181 On July 7, while in Moscow, he responded to a Vice President Biden comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: &quot;We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.&quot;182
On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to preside over a meeting of the United Nations Security Council.183
In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem.184185 During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about one-third.186
Iraq war
During his presidential transition, President-elect Obama announced that he would retain the incumbent Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, in his Cabinet.187
On February 27, 2009, Obama declared that combat operations would end in Iraq within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, &quot;Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.&quot;188 The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troops levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of 35,000 to 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last US combat brigade exited Iraq. The plan is to transition the mission of the remaining troops from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.189190 On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the U.S. combat mission in Iraq was over.191
War in Afghanistan
Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.192 He announced an increase to U.S. troop levels of 17,000 in February 2009 to &quot;stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan&quot;, an area he said had not received the &quot;strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires&quot;.193 He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.194 On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan.195 He also proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date.196197 McChrystal was replaced by David Petraeus in June 2010 after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.198
Cultural and political image
   Obama's family history, early life and upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.199 Obama is also not a descendent of American slaves.200 Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is &quot;black enough&quot;, Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that &quot;we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.&quot;201 Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: &quot;I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.&quot;202
Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.203 During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama has delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.204 
According to the Pew Research Center, Obama's approval ratings dropped from 64% in February, 2009 to 49% in December, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years.205 Polls show strong support for Obama in other countries,206 and before being elected President he has met with prominent foreign figures including then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair,207 Italy's Democratic Party leader and then Mayor of Rome Walter Veltroni,208 and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.209
According to a May 2009 poll conducted by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.210
Obama won Best Spoken Word Album Grammy Awards for abridged audiobook versions of Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.211 His concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video &quot;Yes We Can&quot;, which was viewed by 10 million people on YouTube in its first month212 and received a Daytime Emmy Award.213 In December 2008, Time magazine named Barack Obama as its Person of the Year for his historic candidacy and election, which it described as &quot;the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments&quot;.214
On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples&quot;. 215 Obama accepted this award in Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with &quot;deep gratitude and great humility.&quot;216 The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.217218 Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.
A 2010 Siena College poll of 238 Presidential scholars found that Obama was ranked 15th out of 43, with high ratings for imagination, communication ability and intelligence and a low rating for background (family, education and experience).219
Political positions
 During his Senate service, Obama had a lifetime average conservative rating of 7.67% from the American Conservative Union220 and a lifetime average liberal rating of 90% from the Americans for Democratic Action.221
In April 2005, Obama defended the New Deal social welfare policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and opposed Republican proposals to establish private accounts for Social Security.222 In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Obama spoke out against government indifference to growing economic class divisions, calling on both political parties to take action to restore the social safety net for the poor.223 Obama said in 2007 that he supported universal health care in the United States.224 He has proposed rewarding teachers for performance from traditional merit pay systems, assuring unions that changes would be pursued through the collective bargaining process.225
Obama has supported eliminating taxes for senior citizens with incomes of under $50,000, and raising taxes on income over $250,000, on capital gains, and on dividends.226 He has also supported simplifying tax filings and removing loopholes.227
As an environmental initiative, Obama proposed a cap and trade auction system with no grandfathering to restrict carbon emissions and a ten-year program of investments in new energy sources to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil.228229
In a March 2007 speech, Obama said that the primary way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is through talks and diplomacy, without preconditions, but not ruling out military action.230 In August 2007, Obama remarked that &quot;it was a terrible mistake to fail to act&quot; against a 2005 meeting of al-Qaeda leaders that U.S. intelligence had confirmed to be taking place in Pakistan.231
Obama stated in 2007 that he would enact budget cuts in the range of tens of billions of dollars; stop investing in &quot;unproven&quot; missile defense systems; not weaponize space;, &quot;slow development of Future Combat Systems&quot;, and work towards eliminating all nuclear weapons. Obama favors ending development of new nuclear weapons; reducing the current U.S. nuclear stockpile; enacting a global ban on production of fissile material, and seeking negotiations with Russia to reduce the pressure on both sides for intercontinental ballistic missiles to be on high-alert status.232
Obama has called for more assertive action to oppose genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan.233 He has divested $180,000 in personal holdings of Sudan-related stock, and has urged divestment from companies doing business in Iran.234
Family and personal life

In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: &quot;It's like a little mini-United Nations&quot;, he said. &quot;I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.&quot;235 Obama has seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family &lt;U+2013&gt; six of them living &lt;U+2013&gt; and a half-sister with whom he was raised, Maya Soetoro-Ng, the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband.236 Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham,237 until her death on November 2, 2008,238 two days before his election to the Presidency. In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.239 Obama's great-uncle served in the 89th Division that overran Ohrdruf,240 the first of the Nazi concentration camps to be liberated by U.S. troops during World War II.241
Obama was known as &quot;Barry&quot; in his youth, but asked to be addressed with his given name during his college years.242 Besides his native English, Obama speaks Indonesian at the conversational level, which he learned during his four childhood years in Jakarta.243 He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team.244

 Obama is a well known supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a Senator.246 In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the all star game while wearing a White Sox jacket.247 He is also primarily a Chicago Bears fan in the NFL, but is known to also support the Pittsburgh Steelers,248 and openly rooted for them in their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after Obama took office as President.249
In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin.250 Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date.251 They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.252 The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998,253 followed by a second daughter, Natasha (&quot;Sasha&quot;), on June 10, 2001.254 The Obama daughters attended the private University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the private Sidwell Friends School.255 The Obamas have a Portuguese Water Dog named Bo.256
Applying the proceeds of a book deal, the family moved in 2005 from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago.257 The purchase of an adjacent lot and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.258
In December 2007, Money magazine estimated the Obama family's net worth at $1.3 million.259 Their 2007 tax return showed a household income of $4.2 million&lt;U+2014&gt;up from about $1 million in 2006 and $1.6 million in 2005&lt;U+2014&gt;mostly from sales of his books.260
Obama tried to quit smoking several times over the years and has used nicotine replacement therapy.261262263 However in June 2010, during a congratulatory phone call to president-elect Benigno Aquino of the Philippines, Obama told Aquino that he had quit and would offer advice on how to stop smoking when Aquino was himself ready for that step.264
Religious views
Obama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. In The Audacity of Hope, Obama wrote that he &quot;was not raised in a religious household&quot;. He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as &quot;non-practicing Methodists and Baptists&quot;), to be detached from religion, yet &quot;in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known&quot;. He described his father as &quot;raised a Muslim&quot;, but a &quot;confirmed atheist&quot; by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as &quot;a man who saw religion as not particularly useful&quot;. Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand &quot;the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change&quot;.265 He was baptized at the Trinity United Church of Christ in 1988 and was an active member there for two decades.266 Obama resigned from Trinity during the Presidential campaign after controversial statements made by Rev. Jeremiah Wright became public.267 After a prolonged effort to find a church to attend regularly in Washington, Obama announced in June 2009 that his primary place of worship would be the Evergreen Chapel at Camp David.268 In speaking on the importance of defending religious diversity and the right of secular citizens not to believe or practice, Obama emphasized that:
