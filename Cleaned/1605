Plot
SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) realizes that the Krusty Krab restaurant is celebrating its &quot;eleventy seventh&quot; (one hundred and seventeenth) anniversary. He remembers his first visit to the Krusty Krab and tells Gary about it. SpongeBob then leaves to go to the Krusty Krab, but as soon as he exits his house, he bumps into the back of a long line of customers waiting to get to the restaurant as well. SpongeBob jumps on top of every person in the line, then eventually reaches the Krusty Krab.
Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) tells SpongeBob and Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) that it is a perfect opportunity for his former best friend Plankton (Mr. Lawrence) to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) as a security guard, so that he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture which he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that there is a way to escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.
To get out of the air shaft, SpongeBob molds Squidward, Patrick, and Mr. Krabs into a battering ram to bust out the shaft, and he finally makes it out, only to find that all the customers have left after waiting for so long without getting any food. However, SpongeBob summons them all back as he sings a song in honour of the Krusty Krab. Meanwhile, Plankton finally finds the perfect opportunity to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. He fails, having been caught by Mr. Krabs. The eleventy seventh anniversary celebration then goes ahead.

Critical response
 The film received mixed critical response from critics and fans alike. Nancy Basile of the About.com gave the film positive reviews and wrote &quot;I had doubts that the recent Truth or Square special of SpongeBob SquarePants would be funny or clever. I was quite wrong.&quot; She added that &quot;My kids and I were mesmerized.&quot;61 Jose Strike of the Animation World Network positively reacted to the film and wrote &quot;Truth or Square is a major treat; in fact, I'm so happy I think I'll drop on the deck and flop like a fish...&quot;62 Ian Jane of DVD Talk said &quot;Truth Or Square isn't your typical episode, as it mixes up a lot of live action material in with the more traditional animated sequences to very unusual effect.&quot;63 He added &quot;[...]but there's enough here in terms of the gags and the jokes that even if it's not a classic episode, it's still one worth seeing.&quot;64 Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson said that the film is her favorite among the series.65
However, the film was not immune to negative reception, and was criticized mainly due to the &quot;Patchy the Pirate&quot; segments. Paul Mavis from DVD Talk said &quot;Truth or Square is a strange mix of some truly memorable animated SpongeBob moments interrupted unfortunately by the largely unfunny Patchy the Pirate segments.&quot;66 He added &quot;All of those amusing moments in Truth or Square, along with the A Charlie Brown Christmas ending, make one forget the patchy Patchy segments in Truth or Square.&quot;67 Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict gave the episode a negative review saying &quot;Wow... This is without a doubt the lamest SpongeBob episode I have ever seen[...] In fact, nothing interesting happens at all. The Patchy interludes and reliance on cameos merely draws attention to the episode's lack of substance.&quot;68
In 2010, Tom Kenny won at the 37th Annie Awards for Best Voice Acting in a Television Production category for his performance as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants in the film.6970
