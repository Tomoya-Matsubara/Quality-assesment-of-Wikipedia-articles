The 2007 San Diego Chargers season began with the team trying to improve on their 2006 regular season record of 14-2. The Chargers returned a defensive unit that finished the 2006 season #1 in multiple defensive statistical rankings and an offensive unit that led the NFL in scoring.
Offseason
 After a postseason loss to the New England Patriots, offensive and defensive coordinators Cam Cameron and Wade Phillips left for new coaching jobs with the Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys respectively. Marty Schottenheimer, after originally being told he would stay as head coach, was fired in February1. Replacing Schottenheimer was Norv Turner, who was signed to take over the helm later in the month2. Turner, who installed the Chargers current offensive set when he was the Chargers' offensive coorindator in 20013, was selected to be the head coach largely due to the fact that he would maintain the offensive game plan that lead the team to its best regular season record in team history4. Turner also agreed with general manager A.J. Smith on the hiring of defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell, who had worked with Phillips when both were with the Buffalo Bills and later was the defensive coordinator with the Bills5. Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera, who interviewed for the Chargers' head coaching job, was hired to coach the Chargers' linebackers instead. Smith also re-signed Charger free agent offensive guard Kris Dielman to a six-year contract that will virtually guarantee him almost $17 million and put him around $40 million over the life of the deal 6. Linebacker Donnie Edwards was not offered a contract and signed with his former team, the Kansas City Chiefs7. The Chargers released veteran wide receiver Keenan McCardell during the offseason along with safety Terrence Kiel8910.
2007 NFL Draft
The Chargers started out by making the 30th overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft due to their 14-2 season in 2006. They selected Craig Davis out of Louisiana State University. In the second round, the Chargers made a trade with the Bears in order to move up and select safety Eric Weddle at slot 37#. He was selected as a possible replacement to Terrence Kiel, who was released earlier in the off-season following his arrest on drug charges during the 2006 season11 . The Chargers exchanged their second round selection in 2007 as well as third round , fifth round and 2008 third round selection. The Chargers also selected linebacker Anthony Waters from Clemson University, who missed his senior season due to a leg injury 12.

In the third quarter, the 'Bolts finally managed to score as Rivers complted a 1-yard TD pass to FB Lorenzo Neal, but New England responded with Brady and Moss hooking up with each other again on a 24-yard TD pass. In the fourth quarter, San Diego tried to fight back with Rivers completing a 12-yard TD pass to TE Antonio Gates, but the Patriots ended the game with RB Sammy Morris getting a 3-yard TD run.

After speculation of where the game would be played due to the California wildfires, it was confirmed on October 26 2007 that Qualcomm Stadium would be discontinued as an evacuation site for San Diego residents (with most the evacuees moved to Del Mar). Before, sites in the Phoenix area were being considered to host the game, as well as Houston's Reliant Stadium, and also the Dallas Cowboys' Texas Stadium. Before the game a special tribute was paid to at the stadium for the fire fighters, National Guard, and volunteers who assisted in fighting the fires and helping the evacuees. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attended the game and flipped the coin, which the Chargers won. With an emotional charge from both the players and fans, as well as some victims, the Chargers played one of the best games of their season. Philip Rivers threw 3 touchdown passes despite only throwing 11 passes. Two TDs went to tight end Antonio Gates, and the remainder went to newly acquired wideout Chris Chambers, who was just traded from the Miami Dolphins a two weeks earlier and played his first game as a Charger (due to San Diego's bye week). However, that performance was second to second-year corner Antonio Cromartie, who performance included two interceptions, and two defensive touchdowns. He had a 70 yard INT return for a score, and the other was a complicated snap where the Texans snapped the ball over punter Matt Turk's head, and the ball fell into the end zone. Quickly having to recover, Turk missed grabbing the ball and it fell into the hands of Cromartie, easily scoring. The Chargers won, 35-10 in a home blowout, which was, in the quote of Ladainian Tomlinson, &quot;one for the fans.&quot;

In the first quarter, San Diego struck first with RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 1-yard TD run. The Vikings would respond with RB Adrian Peterson getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, no scoring would come until the final play of the half, as CB Antonio Cromartie returned a missed field goal 109 yards for a touchdown, which is permanently the longest play in NFL history.
In the third quarter, things started to get grim for San Diego as Minnesota took the lead with Peterson getting a 64-yard TD run and QB Brooks Bollinger completing a 40-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. In the fourth quarter, the Chargers tried to comeback as kicker Nate Kaeding nailed a 36-yard field goal. Unfortunately, the Vikings pulled sealed the win with Peterson getting a 46-yard TD run, along with RB Chester Taylor getting a 2-yard TD run. LaDainian Tomlinson, despite getting only 1 rushing touchdown, managed to surpass Jim Brown for most career rushing touchdowns with his 107th TD.

Darren Sproles return the opening kick off 89 yards for a touchdown. After a Nate Kaeding field goal, Sproles returned a punt 45 yards for his second special teams touchdown of the game with less then 6 minutes left in the first quarter.

In the second quarter the Chargers put together a 45 yard drive resulting in a 4 yard touchdown run by LaDainian Tomlinson. Payton Manning was able to score a touchdown to Reggie Wayne leaving the score 23-7 at halftime.
After a scoreless third quarter Manning threw a touchdown to Kenton Keith and the Colts were able to complete the two point conversion. On third and 10 from the Chargers 8 yard line, Philip Rivers went back to pass and the ball slipped out of his hand and into the end zone. Colts linebacker Gary Brackett picked up the ball for a touchdown with 14:28 to play. The Colts failed the two point conversion. With six minutes left in the game Rivers threw an interception to rookie Clint Session. In the red zone the Colts picked up the first down, but the booth reviewed the play and it was determined to be fourth and inches. The Colts intended to go for the first down, but a false start penalty by Ben Utecht moved them five yards back, and instead they went for the field goal. With 1:31 left the Colts lined up the kicking team for a game winning field goal, but Adam Vinatieri's 29 yard kick was wide to the right. The Chargers ran down the clock and the Colts had 22 seconds to score, but the game ended with Clinton Hart intercepting the ball with time expiring for the Chargers win. Manning set a franchise record by throwing six interceptions in one game (3 to Antonio Cromartie and one a piece to Clinton Hart, Matt Wilhelm, and Shaun Philips).
