Jazz Samba is a bossa nova LP by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd, released on the Verve label on April 20, 1962.
Jazz Samba was the first major bossa-nova album on the American jazz scene. It was the real start of the bossa-nova excitement in America, which peaked in the mid-1960s. Though Stan Getz was the featured star of the album, it was very strongly inspired and designed by the guitarist Charlie Byrd. They were joined by two bassists (Keter Betts and Charlie's brother, Gene (Joe) Byrd), and two drummers (Buddy Deppenschmidt and Bill Reichenbach) for the recording at All Souls Church, Unitarian in Washington, D.C. on February 13, 1962, and it was released on April 20, that year as Verve LP V6-8432.
Although it is often described as music by Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim, only two of the seven tracks on the album are Jobim compositions (&quot;Desafinado&quot; [Slightly Out of Tune] and &quot;Samba de Uma Nota S&lt;U+00F3&gt;&quot; [One Note Samba]), the rest being by other Brazilian composers and by Charlie Byrd. Getz won the Grammy for Best Jazz Performance of 1963 for the track &quot;Desafinado&quot;, and went on to make many other bossa-nova recordings, most notably with Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Gilberto and Astrud Gilberto, and most famously &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot;.
