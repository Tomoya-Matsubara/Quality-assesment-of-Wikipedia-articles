 Markowa  is a village in &lt;U+0141&gt;a&lt;U+0144&gt;cut County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Markowa. It lies approximately  south-east of &lt;U+0141&gt;a&lt;U+0144&gt;cut and  east of the regional capital Rzesz&lt;U+00F3&gt;w.1 The village has a population of 4,100.
During World War II many families in the village hid their Jewish neighbours to help them survive the Holocaust. It is now estimated that at least 17 Jews survived the war in Markowa.
Seven members of the Weltz family were hidden in the barn of Dorota and Antoni Szylar. Jakub Einhorn's family was hidden by Jan and Weronika Przybylak and Jakub Lorbenfeld and his family were hidden by Michal Bar. Two girls from the Riesenbach family were initially hidden by Stanislaw Kielar, before joining the other 3 family members in the attic of Julia and J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef Bar.
On March 24, 1944 a patrol of German police came to the house of Wiktoria and J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef Ulm, where they found 8 Jews belonging to the Szall and Goldman families. At first the Germans executed all the Jews. Then they shot the pregnant Wiktoria and her husband. When the six children began to scream at the sight of their parents' bodies, Jozef Kokott, a German police officer (Volksdeutsche from Sudetenland) killed them.
On the 60th anniversary of this tragedy, a memorial was erected in memory of the family.
