The match concluded when Angle was able to kick out of a Frog Splash and got the ankle lock on Guerrero, which caused Guerrero to submit and give the win to Angle.39
 The following match was between Triple H and Eugene. At the start of the match, Triple H attacked Raw ring announcer Lilian Garcia, as distraction to attack Eugene.

Undertaker, however, managed to kick out on the two count. The last moments in the match saw Undertaker hit JBL with the WWE title, in which the referee viewed this and called for the bell and disqualified Undertaker, which resulted in JBL winning the match. Afterwards, Undertaker started to take his frustration out on JBL which resulted in him chokeslamming JBL through the roof of his limousine and JBL was taken out on a stretcher.41

The match saw Orton attempting to get Benoit in a Sharpshooter, but he was quickly countered with Benoit maneuvering a Sharpshooter of his own. During the match, Benoit and Orton were on the outside of the ring, and Benoit catapulted himself through the ropes towards Orton. Orton, however, dodged it, which resulted in Benoit crashing head first into the security barrier. Later in the match, Benoit performed six German suplexes on Orton, but he lost the advantage after Orton blocked a headbutt attempt. The last moment in the title match saw Benoit trying to get the Crippler Crossface on Orton. Orton however, was able to escape and hit an RKO and get the pinfall, thus winning the World Heavyweight Championship and becoming the youngest World Heavyweight Champion in WWE history.42
