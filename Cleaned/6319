History
J.C.F Siemer was a brick mason who immigrated to Davenport from the German states of Schleswig-Holstein. The house is attributed to him and was constructed in 1865.4 The building has had various owners and occupants over the years and in the later part of its existence it was part of a used car lot.
Architecture
The Siemer House was a two-story brick building on a stone foundation. This late Victorian structure featured details that evoked the Italianate style: a bracketed metal cornice, tall, narrow profile of the fenestration, and the centralized entrance.5 The windows were symmetrically placed on the fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade with five on the second floor and two flanking the entrance. The windows were surrounded by small wooden headers and sills.
