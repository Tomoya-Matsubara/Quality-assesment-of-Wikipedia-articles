The United Kingdom general election of December 1910 was held from 3 to 19 December. It was the last British election to be held over several days1 and the last to be held prior to the First World War (1914&lt;U+2013&gt;18).
The Conservatives, led by Arthur Balfour with their Liberal Unionist allies, and the Liberals, led by H. H. Asquith, could not break the deadlock produced in the January general election, with the Conservatives again winning the largest number of votes. The Liberal Party under Asquith formed a government with the support of the Irish Nationalists. This was the last election in which the Liberals won the highest number of seats in the House of Commons.
