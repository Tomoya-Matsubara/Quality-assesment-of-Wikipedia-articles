Johann Eduard Hari (born 21 January 1979) is a British writer and journalist who has written regular columns for The Independent and The Huffington Post and made contributions to several other publications. In 2011, he was suspended from The Independent following multiple charges of plagiarism and was separately accused of making malicious edits of several of his critics' Wikipedia pages under a pseudonym,1 an allegation he later admitted to.2 The exposed plagiarism led to him being forced to return his 2008 Orwell Prize3 and later was a contributing factor in his decision to leave The Independent.4 Hari is currently believed to be writing a book on the war on drugs.5
Early life
Hari was born in Glasgow and raised in London from the age of one. He attended John Lyon School, (an independent school affiliated to Harrow School) and then Woodhouse College, a state sixth-form.6 He graduated from King's College, Cambridge, in 2001 with a double first in Social and Political Sciences.7
Career
In 2000 he was joint winner of The Times Student News Journalist of the Year award for his work on the Cambridge student newspaper Varsity. After university he joined the New Statesman, where he worked between 2001 and 2003, and then wrote two columns a week for The Independent. At the 2003 Press Gazette Awards, he won Young Journalist of the Year.8 A play by Hari, Going Down in History, was performed at the Garage Theatre in Edinburgh, and his book God Save the Queen? was published by Icon Books in 2002.9
In addition to being a columnist for The Independent and the Huffington Post, Hari's work also appeared in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The New Republic, The Nation, Le Monde, El Pais, the Sydney Morning Herald and Ha'aretz. He appeared regularly as an arts critic on the BBC Two programme the Review Show, and he was a book critic for Slate. In 2009 he was named by the Daily Telegraph as one of the most influential people on the left in Britain.10
Personal views
Hari has declared his sympathy with the environmental movement,11 republicanism,12 and drug legalisation.13 He is gay14 and a self-declared secularist and atheist.15
Hari supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq,16 based on a visit to Iraq in December 200217 and a March 2003 story by Kenneth Joseph.18 In 2006 he reversed this position.19
Journalistic controversy
In June 2011 Hari was accused of plagiarism in his use of unattributed quotations in interviews, where he had used previously published quotes in place of his interviewees' recorded answers. The Orwell Prize, which he had won in 2008, was withdrawn following a comparison between one of the articles for which he won the award and the original Der Spiegel article on which it was based. He was shown to have made misleading edits on Wikipedia under a pseudonym. Hari apologised for his actions, although that apology was publicly criticised.202122
Plagiarism
Problems with Hari's journalism were first publicized by the magazine Private Eye in 2003.23 In 2011 bloggers DSG (Deterritorial Support Group) and Brian Whelan (editor of Yahoo! Ireland) highlighted his plagiarism by comparing Hari's interviews with previous interviews by other journalists and previous written works by his interview subjects. The story was taken up by The Guardian,24 The Telegraph,25 and The Washington Post.26
Initially Hari said on his blog27 that he had taken material previously written by interviewees and presented it as part of the interview, but said that this was not plagiarism as he was not passing off someone else's thoughts as his own. Later, both on his blog28 and in The Independent,29 Hari said his use of unattributed quotes was only a clarification. Reviewing this defence, The Guardian's media law consultant focused on copyright issues.30 The newspaper's former editor, Peter Preston, wrote that Hari had been foolish, but not dishonest as his attackers alleged.31 Simon Kelner, then editor-in-chief of The Independent, said on 28 June that the newspaper had not previously received any complaints about Johann Hari.32 In July 2011, Hari was suspended from The Independent for two months33 &quot;pending investigation&quot; by Andreas Whittam Smith.34
Brian Whelan compared Hari's 2010 interview with Gideon Levy35 against Levy's previous writing.36
Guy Walters in the New Statesman compared Hari's 2006 interview with Hugo Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;vez37 with earlier interviews with Chavez by other journalists.3839
Other interviews with Malalai Joya,40 with Ann Leslie,41 with George Michael,42 and with Gareth Thomas43 were also shown to have used misattributed quotations copied from earlier works44 and other interviews.454647
Orwell Prize withdrawal
In June 2011, the Media Standards Trust announced that they recognised the potential of allegations of plagiarism to damage the reputation of the Orwell Prize,48 which Hari had been awarded in 2008 (as the youngest-ever recipient49), and instructed the Council of the Orwell Prize to take action50 to examine the allegations. A month later the spokesman for the Council of the Orwell Prize announced that it had &quot;arrived at a clear and unanimous decision&quot; as to whether Hari would be allowed to retain the prize he had been awarded in 2008. Public announcement was delayed after the Independent had &quot;requested that the council consider further representations by Johann Hari before announcing the decision&quot;,51 which could not be made while the Independent inquiry was ongoing.
In July 2011, both Private Eye and Damian Thompson in his Telegraph blog accused Hari of inventing an atrocity for his Orwell Prize winning article on the Central African Republic. Thompson said that this &quot;horrified the charity so much that it complained to Simon Kelner, the editor of the Independent. Nothing happened&quot;.525354
In September 2011, Johann Hari announced that, though he stood by the articles which won the Orwell Prize in 2008, he would be returning it as an act of contrition for the errors he had made elsewhere.55 The return of the plaque by courier was confirmed by the Council of the Orwell Prize.56 Later the Council confirmed that the Orwell Prize would have been withdrawn had Hari not returned it, because after reviewing one particular article, 'How multiculturalism is betraying women', &quot;The Council concluded that the article contained inaccuracies and conflated different parts of someone else&lt;U+2019&gt;s story (specifically, a report in Der Spiegel). The Council ruled that the substantial use of unattributed and unacknowledged material did not meet the standards expected of Orwell Prize-winning journalism.&quot; The council also disclosed that Hari had not returned the prize money he received of 2000 pounds.57
Wikipedia editing
In July 2011 New Statesman legal correspondent David Allen Green wrote on his personal blog that in January 2005 a Wikipedia user had discovered that a Wikipedia editor, David Rose, using the sockpuppet account 'David r from meth productions' shared an IP address with The Independent newspaper.58 On the same day Nick Cohen in The Spectator59 wrote that he had been attacked on Wikipedia by David Rose following a dispute with Johann Hari, as had Telegraph columnist Cristina Odone,60 and Oliver Kamm, the Times leader writer.61 Cohen also wrote that Hari's own Wikipedia entry had been edited by Rose &quot;to make him seem one of the essential writers of our times&quot;.62
In September 2011 &quot;David Rose&quot; was shown to be Johann Hari.63
Apology
The Independent reported in September 2011 that &quot;Johann Hari, the writer and columnist for The Independent, has admitted plagiarism allegations and will attend a journalism training course before being allowed to rejoin the newspaper&quot; but that the results of the investigation by Whittam Smith are not to be made public.64 The editor of The Independent, Chris Blackhurst, said that some aspects of Hari's journalism had fallen short of the publication's ethical standards, and that Hari had &quot;acknowledged his mistakes and made a full apology.&quot;65
Hari published an apology and admission of misconduct,66 and admitted to using a pseudonym to add positive material to the Wikipedia article about himself and negative material to Wikipedia articles about people he had disputes with.67 Hari said he would take unpaid personal leave of absence until 2012 and seek training in journalistic ethics at his own expense.
According to Blackhurst, speaking as a witness during the Leveson inquiry on 10 January 2012, Hari had &quot;severely damaged&quot; the paper, but announced that he would return to The Independent during February as a columnist.68 This development was soon reversed. On his blog,69 Hari stated on 20 January 2012 that, following his stay in the U.S., he had decided not to return to his job at The Independent, because he was going to write a book which would require international travel. He wrote: &quot;I'm not willing to see other people, who are [sic] played no part in those errors ... take the flack [sic] too&quot;.70
Criticism of apology
After Hari's apology was published, Cristina Odone, blogging for The Telegraph, said that neither she nor the other victims had received any direct apology from The Independent or from Hari himself for his malicious editing of their Wikipedia articles.71
The published apology attracted a strongly worded critique from journalist Toby Young, who also criticized The Independent for failing to sack Hari.72 Tom Chivers, also in The Daily Telegraph, called the apology &quot;evasive&quot;,73 while Richard Seymour wrote in The Guardian that the apology was &quot;self-serving&quot; and that Hari had acknowledged &quot;none of the serious charges made against him...&quot; .74 David Allen Green in the New Statesman wrote: &quot;the terms of the apology do not really approximate to what was actually done. Something very wrong happened, over a significant amount of time, involving a systemic exercise of malice and dishonesty&quot;.75
