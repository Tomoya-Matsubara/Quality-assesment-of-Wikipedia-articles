The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) (Russian: &lt;U+0424&gt;&lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+0411&gt;, &lt;U+0424&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0301&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+044C&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt; &lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0301&gt;&lt;U+0436&gt;&lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt; &lt;U+0431&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0437&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0301&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+0442&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;; Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti) is the main domestic security service of the Russian Federation and the main successor agency of the Soviet-era Cheka, NKVD, and KGB.
The FSB is involved in counter-intelligence, internal and border security, counter-terrorism, and surveillance. Its headquarters are on Lubyanka Square, downtown Moscow, the same location as the former headquarters of the KGB.
The service was formerly known as the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK). A bill calling for the reorganization, expansion and renaming of FSK passed both houses of the Russian parliament and was signed into law on April 3, 1995 by Boris Yeltsin. It was made subordinate to the Ministry of Justice by presidential decree on March 9, 2004.1
Overview
 The FSB is engaged mostly in domestic affairs, while espionage duties were taken over by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (former First Chief Directorate of the KGB). However, the FSB also includes the FAPSI agency, which conducts electronic surveillance abroad. In addition, the FSB operates freely within the territories of the former Soviet republics, and it can conduct anti-terrorist military operations anywhere in the World if ordered by the President, according to the recently adopted terrorism law. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies in Russia work under the guidance of FSB if needed. For example, the GRU, spetsnaz and Internal Troops detachments of Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs work together with the FSB in Chechnya.
The FSB is responsible for internal security of the Russian state, counterespionage, and the fight against organized crime, terrorism, and drug smuggling. However, critics claim that it is engaged in suppression of internal dissent, bringing the entire population of Russia under total control, and influencing important political events, just as the KGB did in the past. To achieve these goals, it is said the FSB implements mass surveillance and a variety of active measures, including disinformation, propaganda through the state-controlled mass media, provocations, and persecution of opposition politicians, investigative journalists, and dissidents.23456789
The FSB is a very large organization that combines functions and powers similar to those exercised by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Protective Service, the Secret Service, the National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection, United States Coast Guard, and Drug Enforcement Administration. FSB also commands a contingent of Internal Troops, spetsnaz, and an extensive network of civilian informants.10 The number of FSB personnel and its budget remain state secrets, although the budget was reported to jump nearly 40% in 2006.11 The number of Chekists in Russia in 1992 was estimated as approximately 500,000.12
Some observers note that FSB is more powerful than KGB was, because it does not operate under the control of the Communist Party as KGB did in the past.13 According to Ion Mihai Pacepa, &quot;In the Soviet Union, the KGB was a state within a state. Now former KGB officers are running the state. They have custody of the country&lt;U+2019&gt;s 6,000 nuclear weapons, entrusted to the KGB in the 1950s, and they now also manage the strategic oil industry renationalized by Putin. The KGB successor, rechristened FSB, still has the right to electronically monitor the population, control political groups, search homes and businesses, infiltrate the federal government, create its own front enterprises, investigate cases, and run its own prison system. The Soviet Union had one KGB officer for every 428 citizens. Putin&lt;U+2019&gt;s Russia has one FSB-ist for every 297 citizens.&quot;14
Peter Finn of the Washington Post argues that the FSB is now the leading political force in Russia, which simply replaced the Communist Party.15 Alexander Litvinenko and Yuri Felshtinsky claim in their book, Blowing up Russia: Terror from within, that the FSB became an international criminal organization that actually promotes and perpetrates the terrorism and organized crime in order to achieve its political and financial goals, instead of fighting the terrorism and crime.16 Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, and Geoffrey Andrews.

History
Initial reorganization of the KGB
During the late 1980s, as the Soviet government and economy were disintegrating, the KGB survived better than most state institutions, suffering far fewer cuts in its personnel and budget. Following the attempted coup of 1991 (in which some KGB units participated)18 against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the KGB was dismantled and formally ceased to exist from November 1991.19
In late 1991 the domestic security functions of the KGB were reconstituted as the Federal Counterintelligence Service (FSK), which was placed under the control of the president. The FSK had been known initially for some time as the Ministry of Security. In 1995, the FSK was renamed and reorganized into the FSB by the Federal Law of April 3, 1995, &quot;On the Organs of the Federal Security Service in the Russian Federation&quot;, granting it additional powers, enabling it to enter private homes and to conduct intelligence activities in Russia as well as abroad in cooperation with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR).20
The FSB reforms were rounded out by decree No. 633, signed by Boris Yeltsin on June 23, 1995. The decree made the tasks of the FSB more specific, giving the FSB substantial rights to conduct cryptographic work, and described the powers of the FSB director. The number of deputy directors was increased to 8: 2 first deputies, 5 deputies responsible for departments and directorates and 1 deputy director heading the Moscow City and Moscow regional directorate. Yeltsin appointed Colonel-General Mikhail Ivanovich Barsukov as the new director of the FSB.
In 1998 Yeltsin appointed as director of the FSB Vladimir Putin, a KGB veteran who would later succeed Yeltsin as federal president.21 Yeltsin also ordered the FSB to expand its operations against labor unions in Siberia and to crack down on right-wing dissidents. As president, Putin increased the FSB's powers to include countering foreign intelligence operations, fighting organized crime, and suppressing Chechen separatists.
Post-2000
On June 17, 2000, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree, according to which the FSB was supposed to have a director, a first deputy director and eight other deputy directors, including one stats-secretary and the chiefs of six departments (Economic Security Department, Counterintelligence Department, Organizational and Personnel Service, Department of activity provision, Department for Analysis, Forecasting and Strategic Planning, Department for Protection of the Constitutional System and the Fight against Terrorism). On June 11, 2001, the President introduced one more deputy director position.
According to a decree signed by Putin on March 11, 2003, by July 1 Border Guard Service of Russia had been transferred to FSB while FAPSI, agency of government telecommunications, had been abolished, granting FSB with a major part of its functions.
On August 12, 2003 Putin allowed the FSB to have three first deputy directors, including the Chief of the Border Guard Service (Vladimir Pronichev), and specified that a deputy director position must be assumed by the Chief of the Inspection Directorate. On July 11, 2004, the President reorganized FSB again.22 It was prescribed to have a director, two first deputy directors (Sergei Smirnov and Vladimir Pronichev, one of whom should be the Chief of the Border Guard Service (Pronichev).
On December 2, 2005, Putin authorized FSB to have one more deputy director. This position was assumed by Vladimir Bulavin on March 3, 2006.
In the beginning of 2006 the Italian news agency ANSA reported the publication on the FSB website of an offer, open to Russian citizens working as spies for a foreign country, to work as double agents.
In September 2006, the FSB was shaken by a major reshuffle, which, combined with some earlier reassignments (most remarkably, those of FSB Deputy Directors Yury Zaostrovtsev and Vladimir Anisimov in 2004 and 2005, respectively), were widely believed to be linked to the Three Whales Corruption Scandal that had slowly unfolded since 2000. Some analysts considered it to be an attempt to undermine FSB Director Nikolay Patrushev's influence, as it was Patrushev's team from the Karelian KGB Directorate of the late 1980s &lt;U+2013&gt; early 1990s that had suffered most and he had been on vacations during the event.232425
Role
Counterintelligence
Then-FSB Director Nikolay Kovalev said in 1996: &quot;There has never been such a number of spies arrested by us since the time when German agents were sent in during the years of World War II.&quot; The FSB reported that around 400 foreign intelligence agents were uncovered in 1995 and 1996.26 In 2006 the FSB reported about 27 foreign intelligence officers and 89 foreign agents whose activities were stopped.27
An increasing number of scientists have been accused of espionage and illegal technology exports by FSB during the last decade: researcher Igor Sutyagin,28 physicist Valentin Danilov,29 physical chemist Oleg Korobeinichev,30 academician Oskar Kaibyshev,31 and physicist Yury Ryzhov.32 Some other widely covered cases of political prosecution include investigator Mikhail Trepashkin33 and journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov.34 All these people are either under arrest or serve long jail sentences.
Ecologist and journalist Alexander Nikitin, who worked with the Bellona Foundation, was accused of espionage. He published material exposing hazards posed by the Russian Navy's nuclear fleet. He was acquitted in 1999 after spending several years in prison (his case was sent for re-investigation 13 times while he remained in prison). Other cases of prosecution are the cases of investigative journalist and ecologist Grigory Pasko,3536 Vladimir Petrenko who described danger posed by military chemical warfare stockpiles, and Nikolay Shchur, chairman of the Snezhinskiy Ecological Fund.37
Other arrested people include Viktor Orekhov, a former KGB officer who assisted Soviet dissidents, Vladimir Kazantsev who disclosed illegal purchases of eavesdropping devices from foreign firms, and Vil Mirzayanov who had written that Russia was working on a nerve gas weapon.38
It has been reported that the FSB uses drugs to erase the memories of people who had access to secret information.39
Counter-terrorism
Over the years, FSB and affiliated state security organizations have killed all elected and appointed presidents of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria including Dzhokhar Dudaev, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, Aslan Maskhadov, and Abdul-Khalim Saidullaev. Just before his death, Saidullaev claimed that the Russian government &quot;treacherously&quot; killed Maskhadov, after inviting him to &quot;talks&quot; and promising his security &quot;at the highest level.&quot;40
During the Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan school hostage crisis, all hostage takers were killed on the spot by FSB spetsnaz forces. Only one of the suspects, Nur-Pashi Kulayev, survived and was convicted later by the court. It is reported that more than 100 leaders of terrorist groups have been killed during 119 operations on North Caucasus during 2006.41
On July 28, 2006 the FSB presented a list of 17 terrorist organizations recognized by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, to Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, which published the list that day. The list had been available previously, but only through individual request.4243 Commenting on the list, Yuri Sapunov, head of anti-terrorism at the FSB, named three main criteria necessary for organizations to be listed.44
Anti-corruption and organized crime
The FSB cooperates with Interpol and other national and international law enforcement agencies. It has provided information on many Russian criminal groups operating in Europe. FSB has also been involved in preparation of requests for extradition of high-profile suspects who escaped abroad, such as Aleksander Litvinenko, Oleg Kalugin, Akhmed Zakayev, Leonid Nevzlin, and Boris Berezovsky. However, these requests have been denied by UK, US, Danish, and Israeli courts.
Border protection
The Federal Border Guard Service (FPS) has been part of the FSB since 2003. Russia has 61,000 kilometers of sea and land borders, 7,500 kilometers of which is with Kazakhstan, and 4,000 kilometers with China. One kilometer of border protection costs around 1 million rubles per year. Vladimir Putin called on the FPS to increase the fight against international terrorism and &quot;destroy terrorists like rats&quot;.45
Export control
The FSB is engaged in the development of Russia's export control strategy and examines drafts of international agreements related to the transfer of dual-use and military commodities and technologies. Its primary role in the nonproliferation sphere is to collect information to prevent the illegal export of controlled nuclear technology and materials.46

Besides the services (departments) and directorates of the federal office, the territorial directorates of FSB in the federal subects are also subordinate to it.
Of these, St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast Directorate of FSB and its predecessors (historically covering both Leningrad/Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast) have played especially important roles in the history of this organization, as many of the officers of the Directorate, including Vladimir Putin and Nikolay Patrushev, later assumed important positions within the federal FSB office or other government bodies. After the last Chief of the Soviet time, Anatoly Kurkov, the St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast Directorate were led by Sergei Stepashin (November 29, 1991 - 1992), Viktor Cherkesov (1992 &lt;U+2013&gt;1998), Alexander Grigoryev (October 1, 1998 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 5, 2001), Sergei Smirnov (January 5, 2001 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 2003), Alexander Bortnikov (June 2003 &lt;U+2013&gt; March 2004) and Yury Ignashchenkov (since March 2004).

Controversies
The FSB has the power to enter any home or business without a search warrant if there is sufficient reason to believe that &quot;a crime has been, or is being, committed there&quot;.4748 Article 24 of the law exempts the agency from certain oversight by Russia&lt;U+2019&gt;s Public Prosecutor.49
Human rights activists have claimed that the FSB has been slow to shed its KGB heritage, and there have been allegations that it has manufactured cases against suspected dissidents and used threats to recruit agents. At the end of the 1990s, critics charged that the FSB had attempted to frame Russian academics involved in joint research with Western arms-control experts.50
Despite early promises to reform the Russian intelligence community, the FSB and the services that collect foreign intelligence and signals intelligence (the SVR and the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information) remained largely unreformed and subject to little legislative or judicial scrutiny.51 Although some limits were placed on the FSB's domestic surveillance activities for example, spying on religious institutions and charitable organizations was reduced all the services continued to be controlled by KGB veterans schooled under the old regime.52 Moreover, few former KGB officers were removed following the agency's dissolution, and little effort was made to examine the KGB's operations or its use of informants.53
Alleged FSB-organized coup
Starting from 1998, people from state security services came to power as Prime Ministers of Russia: a KGB veteran Yevgeny Primakov; former FSB Director Sergei Stepashin; and finally former FSB Director Vladimir Putin who was appointed in August 8, 1999.
In August 7, separatist guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev began an incursion into Dagestan leading to the start of the Dagestan War which was regarded by Anna Politkovskaya as a provocation initiated from Moscow to start war in Chechnya, because Russian forces provided safe passage for Islamic fighters back to Chechnya.54 It was reported that Aleksander Voloshin of the Yeltsin administration paid money to Shamil Basayev to stage this military operation.555657 (Basayev reportedly worked for Russian GRU at this time and earlier).585960
On September 4, a series of four Russian apartment bombings began. Three FSB agents were caught while planting a large bomb in the basement of an apartment complex in the town of Ryazan in September 22.61 That was last of the bombings. Russian Minister of Internal Affairs Rushailo congratulated police with preventing the terrorist act, but FSB Director Nikolai Patrushev declared that the incident was a training exercise just an hour later, when he had learned that the FSB agents were caught.62
The next day, Boris Yeltsin received a demand from 24 Russian governors to transfer all state powers to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, according to Sergei Yushenkov63. The Second Chechen War began on September 24. This war made Prime Minister Vladimir Putin very popular, although he was previously unknown to the public, and helped him to win a landslide victory in the presidential elections on March 26, 2000.
This was a successful coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat organized by the FSB to bring Vladimir Putin to power, according to former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko, lawmaker Sergei Yushenkov, and journalist David Satter, a Johns Hopkins University and Hoover Institute scholar.646566 All attempts to independently investigate the Russian apartment bombings were unsuccessful. Journalist Artyom Borovik died in a suspicious plane crash. Vice-chairman of the Sergei Kovalev commission created to investigate the bombings, Sergei Yushenkov, was assassinated. Another member of this commission Yuri Shchekochikhin died presumably from poisoning by thallium. Investigator Mikhail Trepashkin hired by relatives of victims was arrested and convicted by Russian authorities for allegedly disclosing state secrets.
FSB as ruling political elite
According to former Russian Duma member Konstantin Borovoi, &quot;Putin's appointment is the culmination of the KGB's crusade for power. This is its finale. Now the KGB runs the country.&quot;67 Olga Kryshtanovskaya, director of the Moscow-based Center for the Study of Elites, has found that up to 78% of 1,016 leading political figures in Russia have served previously in organizations affiliated with KGB or FSB.68 She said: &quot;If in the Soviet period and the first post-Soviet period, the KGB and FSB people were mainly involved in security issues, now half are still involved in security but the other half are involved in business, political parties, NGOs, regional governments, even culture... They started to use all political institutions.&quot;69 &quot;Like cockroaches spreading from a squalid apartment to the rest of the building, they have eventually gained a firm foothold everywhere,&quot; said Sergei Grigoryants, a Soviet dissident.70
This situation is very similar to that of the former Soviet Union where all key positions in the government were occupied by members of the Communist Party. The KGB or FSB members usually remain in the &quot;acting reserve&quot; even if they formally leave the organization (&quot;acting reserve&quot; members receive second FSB salary, follow FSB instructions, and remain &quot;above the law&quot; being protected by the organization, according to Kryshtanovskaya).71 As Vladimir Putin said, &quot;There is no such thing as a former KGB man&quot;.72 GRU defector and writer Victor Suvorov explained that members of Russian security services can leave such organizations only in a coffin, because they know too much. Soon after becoming prime minister of Russia, Putin also claimed that &quot;A group of FSB colleagues dispatched to work undercover in the government has successfully completed its first mission.&quot;73
The idea of the KGB acting as a leading political force rather than a security organization has been discussed by historian Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov,74 journalist John Barron, writer and former GRU officer Victor Suvorov, retired KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin,75 and Evgenia Albats. According to Avtorkhanov, &quot;It is not true that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party is a superpower... An absolute power thinks, acts and dictates for all of us. The name of the power NKVD MVD MGB. ...Chekism in ideology, Chekism in practice. Chekism from top to bottom.&quot;76
According to Albats, most KGB leaders, including Lavrenty Beria, Yuri Andropov, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, have always struggled for the power with the Communist Party and manipulated the communist leaders. Moreover, FSB has formal membership, military discipline, an extensive network of civilian informants,77 hardcore ideology, and support of population (60% of Russians trust FSB),78 which makes it a perfect totalitarian political party.79 However the FSB party does not advertise its leading role because the secrecy is an important advantage.
With regard to death of Aleksander Litvinenko, the highest-ranking Soviet Bloc intelligence defector, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa stated that there is &quot;a band of over 6,000 former officers of the KGB one of the most criminal organizations in history who grabbed the most important positions in the federal and local governments, and who are perpetuating Stalin&lt;U+2019&gt;s, Khrushchev&lt;U+2019&gt;s, and Brezhnev&lt;U+2019&gt;s practice of secretly assassinating people who stand in their way.&quot;80
It is well known that certain very senior clergy of the Moscow Patriarchate are members of the FSB. They use their ecclesiastical positions to further the interests of the Russian State in foreign countries.
Suppression of internal dissent
Many Russian opposition lawmakers and investigative journalists have been assassinated while investigating corruption and alleged crimes conducted by FSB and state authorities: Sergei Yushenkov, &lt;U+200E&gt;Yuri Shchekochikhin, Galina Starovoitova, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko, Paul Klebnikov, Nadezhda Chaikova, Nina Yefimova, and many others.81828384 Former KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky believes that murders of writers Yuri Shchekochikhin (author of &quot;Slaves of KGB&quot;85), Anna Politkovskaya, and Aleksander Litvinenko show that FSB has returned to the practice of political assassinations86 which were conducted in the past by the Thirteenth KGB Department.87 Just before his death, Alexander Litvinenko accused Vladimir Putin of personally ordering the assassination of Anna Politkovskaya.88
Political dissidents from the former Soviet republics, such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, are often arrested by FSB and extradited to these countries for prosecution, despite protests from international human rights organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rakhmonov&gt;&quot;An oppositioner was transferred to Rakhmonov&quot; by Irina Borogan - Novaya Gazeta89 Special services of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also kidnap people at the Russian territory, with the implicit approval of FSB.90
Criticism of anti-terrorist operations
Use of excessive force by the FSB spetsnaz was criticized with regard to resolving Moscow theater hostage crisis and Beslan hostage crisis. According to Sergey Kovalev, the Russian government kills its citizens without any hesitation. He provided the following examples: murdering of hostages by the poison gas during Moscow theater hostage crisis; burning school children alive by spetsnaz soldiers who used RPO flamethrowers during Beslan school hostage crisis; crimes committed by death squads in Chechnya;91 and assassination of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev.92 Anna Politkovskaya and Irina Hakamada, who conducted unofficial negotiations with terrorists, stated that the hostage takers were not going to use their bombs to kill the people and destroy the building during Moscow theater hostage crisis.93
According to Anna Politkovskaya, most of the &quot;Islamic terrorism cases&quot; were fabricated by the government, and the confessions have been obtained through the torture of innocent suspects. &quot;The plight of those sentenced for Islamic terrorism today is the same as that of the political prisoners of the Gulag Archipelago... Russia continues to be infected by Stalinism&quot;, she said.94
Alleged involvement in terrorist acts
Former FSB officer Aleksander Litvinenko and investigator Mikhail Trepashkin alleged that Moscow theater hostage crisis was directed by a Chechen FSB agent.9596 Yulia Latynina and other journalists also accused the FSB of staging many smaller terrorism acts, such as market place bombing in the city of Astrakhan, bus stops bombings in the city of Voronezh, and the blowing up the Moscow-Grozny train,9798 whereas innocent people were convicted or killed. Journalist Boris Stomakhin claimed that a bombing in Moscow metro in 200499 was probably organized by FSB agents rather than by the unknown man who called the Kavkaz Center and claimed his responsibility.100 Stomakin was arrested and imprisoned for writing this and other articles.101
Many journalists and workers of international NGOs were reported to be kidnapped by FSB-affiliated forces in Chechnya who pretended to be Chechen terrorists: Andrei Babitsky from Radio Free Europe, Arjan Erkel and Kenneth Glack from Doctors Without Borders, and others.102
Alleged involvement in organized crime
Former FSB officer Aleksander Litvinenko accused FSB personnel of involvement in organized crime, such as drug trafficking and contract killings.103 It was noted that FSB, far from being a reliable instrument in the fight against organized crime, is institutionally a part of the problem, due not only to its co-optation and penetration by criminal elements, but to its own absence of a legal bureaucratic culture and use of crime as an instrument of state policy.104
International affairs
FSB collaborates very closely with secret police services from some former Soviet Republics, especially Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.105106 The FSB is accused of working to undermine governments of Baltic states107 and Georgia.108 During the 2006 Georgian-Russian espionage controversy, several Russian GRU officers were accused by Georgian authorities of preparations to commit sabotage and terrorist acts.
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission Richard Butler found than many Russian state-controlled companies were involved in the Oil-for-Food Programme-related fraud. As a part of this affair, former FSB Director Yevgeny Primakov had received large kickbacks from Saddam Hussein according to Butler.109 The KGB, FSB and Russian government had very close relationships with Saddam Hussein and Iraqi Intelligence Service Mukhabarat according to Yossef Bodansky, the Director of Research of the International Strategic Studies Association.
