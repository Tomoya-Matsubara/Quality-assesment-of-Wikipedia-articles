Georg Bochmann, (born 18 September 1913 in Albernau; died 8 June 1973 in Offenbach am Main) was an SS-Oberf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer of the Waffen-SS. He was also a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. He served in the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf, the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen, the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G&lt;U+00F6&gt;tz von Berlichingen and the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel.
Early career
Georg Bochmann was born in Albernau, in the Erzgebirge region of Saxony on the border with Bohemia. His family were textile workers of modest means. He studied at the University of Leipzig. After joining the Hitler Youth, Bochmann joined the Nazi party in 1933 (Membership Number : 1907565) and the SS Totenkopf the following year (Membership Number : 122362), working at the Dachau concentration camp for political prisoners. In 1936 he was promoted SS Untersturmf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer (Second Lieutenant), and appointed to the &quot;SS-Totenkopf Standarte Oberbayern&quot;.
World War II
In November 1939 he was appointed SS Obersturmf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer (First Lieutenant) and &quot;was a prime mover in the creation and outfitting of the SS Totenkopf Division, 1939-1940.&quot;1 In 1940 he assumed command of an armoured unit within the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf and during the French campaign the Division fought at Cambrai, Arras, Dunkirk, and participated in deep thrusts into southwestern France. For his successes Bochmann received the Iron Cross, second class. A little later he was promoted to SS Hauptsturmf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer (Captain). The 3rd SS Division Totenkopf remained in France until April 1941 when it was transferred east to prepare for Operation Barbarossa.
On the eastern front the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf fought as part of the German Army Group &quot;North&quot;. Bochmann fought in the Baltic to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and was cited for his performances at Kaunas and D&lt;U+00FC&gt;naburg (now Daugavpils) in Latvia. In July 1941 Bochmann received the Iron Cross, first class, and in August 1941 the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf reached Ilmen lake.
In January 1942 3rd SS Division Totenkopf was formally transferred to the German Second Army Corps and during the Soviet winter offensive there was a particularly savage battle at Demyansk. Nearly 100,000 German soldiers were surrounded for three months and were mostly supplied by Luftwaffe air drops. For his exceptional merit, tenacity and leadership, Bochmann was awarded the Knight's Cross. A little after that he received the famous Demyansk Shield. On 2 April 1942 Bochmann was promoted to SS Sturmbannf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer (Major).
On 21 October 1942 Bochmann was appointed commander of the 2nd Motorised Battalion of the Regiment &quot;Thule&quot; (within the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf). In late October the entire division was withdrawn from the eastern front and sent to France for rest and recuperation. After returning to the eastern front, Bochmann assumed command of the 3rd Motorised Battalion and participated in the battles for Kharkov, Sorokovka and Tetlega. For his valiant successes in these struggles he was awarded on 17 May 1943 with the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross. He was the 246th recipient and was awarded by Hitler in person.
Later Bochmann was appointed to command a tank regiment in the division and on 9 November 1943 he was promoted SS-Obersturmbannf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer (Lieutenant Colonel). Following fresh injuries he was withdrawn from the front and sent home. In Germany he was appointed head of SS Officer's School for Administration in Arolsen, Hesse. On 9 November 1944 he was promoted to SS-Standartenf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer and transferred to 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. However after only a few weeks he was hastily transferred to command the 9th SS armored regiment in the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen on 20 November.
Bochmann actually only returned to combat on 2 January 1945 when he was appointed commander of the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Horst Wessel. After a brief stint fighting in the west, the division was moved to the eastern front, where it was decimated and quickly surrounded by the Red Army in Oberglogau, Silesia. Although wounded, Bochmann led a successful breakthrough and was awarded the Swords to the Knights Cross (becoming the 140th recipient), Oak Leaves and the prestigious Wound Badge in Gold. Also he was promoted to SS-Oberf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer on 20 April 1945.2
With only a few weeks of war left Bochmann was appointed commander of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G&lt;U+00F6&gt;tz von Berlichingen. After retreating through Bavaria he refused suicidal orders from Generalfeldmarschall Ferdinand Sch&lt;U+00F6&gt;rner to attack Allied troops, was dismissed from his post and plans were started to court martial him.3
On 9 May 1945 Georg Bochmann surrendered to United States troops in the Rottach-Egern region.

Georg Bochmann died after an illness on 8 June 1973 in Offenbach am Main, aged 59.
