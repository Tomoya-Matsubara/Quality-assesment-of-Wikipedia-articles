Disability activism
Accessibility of all the medical institutions in India
On his petition the Court of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, under Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India instructed Medical Council of India to issue directives to all the medical institutions in India to be disabled-friendly.234 Despite these efforts, most medical institutions still need to comply with the directions.567 His black armband protest on the United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities in 2012 led authorities to construct ramps outside all the hostels at his medical college.8
Disabled friendly polling booths
He played an integral role of whistleblower to raise the issue of problems faced by voters with disability before and during the Delhi legislative assembly elections, 2013 through Right to Information.91011 He also wrote to election commission as well as Chief Justice of India to allow disabled voters to vote again before declaration of final results.12 His RTI on fourth National Voters' Day revealed how Election Commission of India was caught unprepared to enfranchise electors with disability.13 It showed violation of Supreme Court orders of 2004 to empower voters with disabilities.14 After the expose Chief Electoral Office, Delhi involved him in making elections in Delhi disabled-friendly.15 Not only he sensitised the election officers on how to help electors with disability but he also helped in setting up a disability registration helpline.16 His sustained efforts lead to election booth across the Capital accessible to disabled and elderly voters.17 Further, on his petition the disability court warned the Election Commission of India to make its website disabled friendly.18
Withdrawal of Union Public Service Commission&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+2018&gt;discriminatory proforma&lt;U+2019&gt;
Dr Singh challenged Union Public Service Commission&lt;U+2019&gt;s format whereby disabled applicants were asked to paste photographs showing their disability as a proof. The Court of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities directed the UPSC to refrain from asking disabled candidates to submit photographs showing their disabilities and to consider the &lt;U+2018&gt;permanent disability certificate&lt;U+2019&gt; issued from a government hospital as a valid proof.19 He also brought into open the discrimination by UPSC which disallowed doctors with disabilities to apply for various posts. He himself was rejected in 2011 but fought and was later allowed with other disabled doctors to appear for the interview.2021 In 2013, his application was again rejected when he highlighted that same discrimination is also there for the other posts.22 Undeterred, he complained again and requested health ministry to allow all eligible doctors with disabilities to apply for these posts. He was allowed to apply in a quick intervention.23
Dignified screening of people with disabilities at airports
After he was harassed24 by security personnel at the Hyderabad airport because of his orthosis, Dr Singh approached Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to amend rustic screening procedures and modify guidelines taking Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into consideration. The disability watchdog has directed both DGCA and BCAS to make sure people with disabilities are not being harassed or humiliated at airports and that security personnel have been sensitized towards them.2526
Corrected wrong celebration of Salk's birthday on World Polio Day
Rotary International established World Polio Day (24 October) to commemorate the birthday of virologist Jonas Salk who developed polio vaccine.27 This erroneous observance was first challenged by Dr Singh in his publication in the official journal of the Edward Jenner Society's Vaccine (journal).28 Even Google dedicated a doodle on Salk's 100th birthday to confirm 28 October as his birthday.29 Rotary still celebrates the day on 24 October despite media reporting on the contrary.30
His sustained advocacy also lead to ramps being constructed at ATMs.31 He also raised awareness by highlighting inaccessible ATMs32 and post offices333435 in the capital to persons with disabilities through Right to Information Act.
