Heinz Field is an American football stadium located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is the home to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Panthers; members of the National Football League (NFL) and National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), respectively. The stadium opened in 2001, shortly after the controlled implosion of the teams' previous stadium, Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium is named for locally based H. J. Heinz Company, which bought the naming rights in 2001.
Funded in conjunction with PNC Park, the US$281 million stadium stands along the Allegheny River, on the Northside of Pittsburgh. The stadium was designed with the city of Pittsburgh's history of steel production in mind, which lead to the inclusion of 12,000 tons of steel into the design.1 Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999 and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium's natural grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers ownership has kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. Attendance for the 65,050 seat stadium has sold out for every Steelers home game, a streak which dates back to 1972. A collection of memorabilia from the Steelers and Panthers of the past can be found in the Coca-Cola Great Hall.
History
Planning and funding
The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Pirates shared Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pittsburgh Pirates building a full-time baseball park, a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility.2 Though met with negative reaction from Steelers ownership, the proposal was used as a &quot;fallback position&quot; that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed.3 Steelers ownership stated that failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might opt to sign with other teams, such as the other five teams in the Steelers division who had all recently built new football-only stadiums.4 In June 2001, the H. J. Heinz Company purchased the naming rights to the stadium.5 As per the deal, Heinz will pay the Steelers a total of $57 million through 2021.67
Originally, a sales tax increase was proposed to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and an expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. After the rejection of this proposal in a referendum, the city developed Plan B.8 Similarly controversial, the alternative proposal was labeled Scam B by opponents.9 The Steelers' pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even after it was raised from $50 million to $76.5 million.1011 Other local government members criticized the $281 million of public money allocated for Plan B.1213 One member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District board called the use of tax dollars &quot;corporate welfare&quot;.14 The plan, totaling $809 million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field.1516 Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to stay in the city until at least 2031.17 The total cost of Heinz Field was $281 million.18
Design and construction
Kansas City-based HOK Sport designed the stadium.1920 HOK's project manager for Heinz Field, Melinda Lehman, stated the Rooney family asked that the stadium's design &quot;acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going.&quot;21 In order to accomplish this, HOK used steel structurally and externally.22 The stone used in Heinz Field's design is artificial, in order to decrease cost.23 Of the glass used in the stadium's design, Lehman said, &quot;The glass is a more modern building element, which ties into a lot of the buildings in [Downtown] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas.&quot;24 The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the amount of players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms' design.25 As with its predecessor, Heinz Field's culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400 eateries are located throughout the stadium.26 A bronze statue of Steelers founder Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved 100 feet from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium.27 In addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt's Cathedral of Learning was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field's 27 by 96 foot Sony JumboTron was the largest scoreboard in the NFL.28
Heinz Field in 2005
Ground was broken for Heinz Field on June 18, 1999, at a ceremony co-hosted by the Steelers and the University of Pittsburgh.29 The stadium was constructed by Hunt Construction Group and Mascaro Corparation.30 The two companies directed 1,400 workers over two years, in which there were no constrction accidents or lawsuits.31 The stadium is inspected yearly, along with PNC Park, by Chronicle Consulting, LLC, for structural defects and maintenance.32
Opening and other events
The first event held at Heinz Field was a concert hosted by the band 'N Sync, on August 18, 2001.3334 Prior to the Steelers regular season schedule, the team played a pre-season game against the Detroit Lions on August 25, 2001.35 Pittsburgh won the stadium's unofficial opening game 20&lt;U+2013&gt;7, with 57,829 spectators in attendance.36 The first official football game played in the stadium was between the Pittsburgh Panthers and East Tennessee State, on September 1. The Panthers won the game 31&lt;U+2013&gt;0, with quarterback David Priestley scoring the first touchdown on an 85-yard run.37 The Steelers were scheduled to open the regular season play at Heinz Field on September 16 against the Cleveland Browns, however, due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, all NFL games of the week were postponed;3839 thus moving the stadium's premiere to October 7, against the Cincinnati Bengals.40 Prior to the game, a speech from US President George W. Bush, ordering attacks on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan was shown live on the stadium's JumboTron.41 The speech was met with much applause and support from the spectators in attendance.42 Pittsburgh defeated the Bengals by a score of 16&lt;U+2013&gt;7. Steelers kicker Kris Brown scored the first NFL points in the stadium on a 26-yard field goal, and quarterback Kordell Stewart scored the first touchdown on an eight yard run.43

Features
Playing surface
In June 2001, Kentucky Bluegrass was laid on the field,49 at half the height of most NFL field's 2 inch grass. The field is heated from below, using a mixture of antifreeze and hot water, to keep the field at around 62 degrees Fahrenheit in order to keep the grass growing year-round.50 The field was re-surfaced multiple times, until the synthetic-enhanced Desso GrassMaster was installed in 2003.51 Debate continued over the surface after players began slipping during game play. Despite this players and coaches of Pitt, the Steelers, and their opponents supported keeping the current turf.52
On Friday, November 21, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL championship football games which were followed the day after with a game between Pitt played South Florida. After discussion with the NFL,53 Steelers ownership made the decision to re-surface the field for their nationally televised game against Miami on Monday evening. A layer of sod was laid overtop the 2.5 acre Desso GrassMaster surface.54 The field's condition was exacerbated by 1&lt;U+00BD&gt; inches of rain after the new sod had been laid,55 which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began.56 The Steelers won the game 3&lt;U+2013&gt;0, with a field goal with 17 seconds remaining in regulation.57 Scott Brown, of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called the field a &quot;veritable mud pit&quot;.58 While Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players' Association, also criticized the field citing a 2006 survey of NFL players that ranked Heinz Field as the second worst field in the league.59 Steelers receiver Hines Ward called the playing conditions &quot;horrendous&quot; after the game.60 However, the following day he and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface stating, &quot;I think everybody wants to keep the grass.&quot;61 Debate continued over the field later in the season when Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor called the field &quot;a lawsuit pending&quot;.62 Pittsburgh's ownership stated that the decision was up to the players, who once again defended the natural surface.63 In February 2008, the Steelers announced that they would keep the Desso GrassMaster surface.64 
Seating and tickets
As of 2008, the Pittsburgh Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.65 The majority of the 65,050 seats are colored &quot;Steeler gold&quot;, though club seats are dark gray.6667 Heinz Field features 1,500 seats in 129 luxury boxes, with prices ranging from $44,000 to $125,000 depending on location and size. These boxes were predicted to increase the Steelers' profits from $10 to $11 million per season over those at Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium also features 6,600 club seats that include a restaurant and an indoor bar, at prices up to $1,900 per person.68 For the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09 season ticket prices for Panthers games range from a maximum of $270 per club seat with required donations per seat between $250 and $500 depending on location, to as low as $72 per seat for upper end zone sections.69 Attendance for Panther games has varied; four games were sold-out through the stadium's first seven seasons. The Panthers averaged 59,197 people per game throughout the 2003 season, however, the figure dropped to 33,680 in 2007.70
Great Hall
The Coca-Cola Great Hall spans approximately 40,000 square feet on the east side of the stadium and houses a collection of Steelers and Pittsburgh Panthers memorabilia. The Hall includes a timeline of the Steelers franchise's major events, an oversized Steelers helmet hangs from the ceiling beside a video screen that shows entertainment for fans throughout game days.71 The Great Hall also features the actual lockers of several former Steelers, including Hall of Fame members Franco Harris, Joe Greene, and Bill Dudley.72 Five large Super Bowl trophies-shaped display columns were erected and contain artifacts from each championship the Steelers have won including replica trophies.73 Two display columns are dedicated to the University of Pittsburgh and contain memorabilia from the Panthers' teams. The floor is painted to resemble the field at Three Rivers Stadium, with the word &quot;Steelers&quot; painted in black over a gold background.74 University of Pittsburgh players are featured on two large murals within the Hall. Eight additional tile murals created by local high schools represent western Pennsylvania football history.75
