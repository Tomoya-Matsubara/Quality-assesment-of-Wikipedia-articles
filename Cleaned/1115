Airspeed AS.6 Envoy was a light, twin-engined transport aircraft designed by Airspeed Ltd. in Great Britain.
Development
The first flight, with the aircraft C-ACMT took place on June 26, 1934 and in July 1934, the aircraft was presented to the public for the first time at an exhibition by Society of British Aerospace. In October 1936, the British Ministry of Defence ordered 136 Envoys for the role of crew-training. These further developed aircraft were given a new designation; Airspeed AS 10 Oxford.
Operational use
The machine proved as commercial success. Lord Nuffield bought a Envoy and won thereby the air race from London to Johannesburg in 1934.. Soon after, orders came from the whole Commonwealth. Two aircraft went to the Ansett Airlines in Australia. North Eastern Airways also used the AS.6. In Czechoslovakia, the CSA ordered four AS.6 Envoy JC in 1937.
The Airspeeds AS.6 Envoy also entered the Air Forces of different countries, besides Great Britain, the aircraft was used in Spain, Japan, South Africa, Finland and China was used and some others. The RAF used a small number of AS.6 in a military configuration. Seven machines were ordered for joint use by the South African Air Force and South African Airways, with three being delivered in military form and four delivered to South African Airways, where they were used on the air route between Johannesburg - Bloemfontein - Port Elizabeth on 12 October 1936.1 All seven could be transformed by four persons within four hours from the transportation version into a light bomber or reconnaissance aircraft. In this configuration the crew consisted of four; pilot, navigator, radio operator and gunner.2
The Envoy was involved in a tragic accident in Australia. The VH-UXY, carrying Lieutenant Charles Ulm, disappeared in 1934, during an attempt to fly the Pacific route between Oakland and Honolulu.3 Two AS.6 aircraft were to participate in the MacRobertson Air Race in 1934, from England to Australia, but both remained on the ground, but one was damaged on the eve of the race and was withdrawn, and the other, a specially modified version with long range tanks (the AS 8 Viceroy) got as far as Athens before abandoning the race.4
During the Spanish Civil War, two AS.6 Envoy were used on the nationalist side 5as reconnaissance aircraft or light bombers.
In May 1937, the British King traded his de Havilland Dragon Rapide for an Airspeed AS.6J Envoy III. The AS.6's good stability and flaps, as well as its low landing speed (less than 100 km/h) was decisive. The aircraft received had the identification code G-AEXX and was painted in distinctive red and blue colours .6
During the Second World War, the German Luftwaffe captured some machines and used them as trainer aircraft. Luftwaffe gave one aircraft to Finland on 22 January 1942, as reparation for the mistakenly shooting down of a Finnish de Havilland Dragon Rapide. This aircraft was used between 1942 and 1943. Likewise, one aircraft was used between 1941 to 1943 by the Slovaks.
