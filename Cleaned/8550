Tapad Inc. is a venture-funded startup company that develops and markets software and services for cross-device advertising and content delivery. It uses algorithms to analyze internet and device data and predict whether two or more devices are owned by the same person. Participating websites and apps then cater their advertisements based on a collective knowledge of the user's actions across all of their devices. Tapad was founded in 2010 by Are Traasdahl. It raised $1.8 million in funding in June 2011 and another $6.5 million in March 2013.
History
The idea for Tapad was conceived by cofounder and CEO Are Traasdahl at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). He saw attendees switching between televisions, laptops and smartphones and thought that brands should be able to cater their ads to individual users even as they switch between devices.1 Cofounder and CTO Dag Liodden, Traasdahl, and four others began developing algorithms for the software2 and founded Tapad in 2010.3 It took almost a year for the company to obtain its first client, but afterwards the organization grew quickly.4 In 2011, it raised $1.8 million in funding5 and opened five more sales offices in major US cities.6 From mid-2012 to mid-2013, the company hired 44 people and moved its headquarters to a larger office in New York City.7 Another $6.5 million in funding was raised in March 2013.8
Software and services
Tapad uses data such as cookie IDs, operating system IDs,910 IP addresses,11 online registrations12 and data from partnering publishers13 to develop a probability that different devices are shared by the same person or household.14 According to Tapad, none of the data contains personally identifiable information (PII).15
Tapad is used for advertising to consumers across devices, where a user is shown an ad on their mobile or tablet device based on websites they visited on a desktop1617 or based on a usage behavior that matches an advertiser's target audience.18 For example, if an Android phone visits a website shortly after a desktop PC from the same home network, Tapad will assess that there is a high probability that the two devices are operated by the same person and will show them similar ads on both devices.19 According to the company website, its services also include cross-device analytics for things like location, timing, user behavior, and audience analysis.20
Privacy
Advertisements using Tapad usually feature a notification that explains the ad is being shown as a result of behavioral analysis21 and provide an opt-out button2223 in compliance with standards set by the Digital Advertising Alliance.2425 The disclosure features are provided by Evidon, which Tapad partnered with in November 2011.26 According to Forbes, Tapad's &quot;burgeoning success risks irking Congress, regulators and privacy advocates.&quot;27 The company's CEO says it shouldn't be a problem, since it doesn't collect personally identifiable information.28
