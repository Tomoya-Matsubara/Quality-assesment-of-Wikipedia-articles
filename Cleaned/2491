 Ship notes=
Ina was a pre-dreadnought battleship of the French Navy. The ship's keel was laid in 1898 and she was completed four years later. Her design was derived from the preceding sclass Charlemagne battleships with a heavier secondary Artillery battery battery and thicker armour. She retained the tumblehome characteristic of all large French warships of this period that caused stability issues. Upon completion Iena was assigned to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean France Mediterranean Squadron and remained there for the duration of her career. She participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers and made many visits to French ports in the Mediterranean.
While docked for repairs, Ina was gutted on 12 March 1907 by a magazine artillery magazine explosion caused by the decomposition of well-aged Powder B propellant. While it was possible to repair her, the ship was not thought worth the time or expense. Her hulk ship hulk was used as a gunnery target before it was sold for scrap in 1912.
Design
Ina was designed at the request of the Board of Construction lang-fr Conseil des travaux to follow the Charlemagne class ships whose seakeeping qualities were not entirely satisfactory. But Constructor Thibaudier just modified the Charlemagne's design with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour, distributed in a slightly different manner. This increased her displacement by convert 700 t LT in comparison to the older ships and she retained the pronounced tumblehome that was the cause of the stability problems.Caresse, p. 121
General characteristics
The Ina was longer than her predecessors, at convert 122.35 m ftin length overall overall. She had a beam nautical beam of convert 20.83 m ftin and, at deep load, a draft ship draft of convert 7.45 m ftin forward and convert 8.45 m ft aft. She was only slightly heavier than the Charlemagne class and displaced convert 11688 MT LT normally, and convert 12105 MT LT -1 at full load, 700 metric tons more than the earlier ships.
Ina was fitted with large bilge keels, but was reported to roll considerably and pitch heavily,Gardiner, p. 296 although this is contradicted by the ship's captain's report of November 1905: From the sea-keeping point of view the Ina is an excellent ship. Pitching and rolling movements are gentle and the ship rides the waves well.Caresse, p. 127
Propulsion
Ina used three Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion vertical triple expansion steam engines built by Les Forges et Chantiers de la Mditerrane, one engine per shaft. Each shaft drove a three-bladed propeller that was convert 4.5 m ftin in diameter on the wing shafts and convert 4.4 m ftin in diameter on the center shaft. The engines were powered by twenty Belleville water-tube boilers at a working pressure of convert 18 kg/cm2 kPa psi 0 abbr=on lk=on. The engines were rated at a total of convert 16500 ihp lk=on and produced convert 16590 ihp abbr=on during the ship's sea trials. Iena reached a top speed of convert 18.11 knots lk=in on her trials. She carried a maximum of convert 1165 t LT of coal which allowed her to steam for convert 4500 nmi lk=on at a speed of convert 10 kn. The ship's 80-volt electrical power was provided by 600-ampere and 1200-ampere dynamos.
Armament
Like the Charlemagne class which preceded her, Ina carried her main armament of four convert 305 mm in abbr=on 0, 40-caliber artillery calibre Canon de 305 mm Modle 1893/96 guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft.  The guns fired convert 340 kg lb adj=on projectiles at the rate of 1 round per minute at a muzzle velocity of convert 780 m/s ft/s abbr=on. This gave a range of convert 12000 m yd at the maximum elevation of 15. The magazines stored 180 shells per gun, enough for three hours of fighting.
The ship's secondary armament consisted of eight 45-calibre Canon de 164 mm Modle 1893 guns, which were mounted in individual casemates. The guns fired convert 164.7 mm in abbr=on, convert 52 kg lb adj=on shells at a muzzle velocity of convert 865 m/s ft/s abbr=on to a maximum range of convert 9000 m yd. A total of 1606 rounds were carried, enough for three hours of fighting at the practical 12 rounds per minute per gun. Ina also carried eight convert 100 mm in abbr=on, 45-calibre Canon de 100 mm Modle 1893 guns in gun shield shielded mounts on the shelter deck. These guns fired a convert 12 kg lb adj=on projectile at convert 710 m/s ft/s abbr=on, which could be trained up to 20 for a maximum range of convert 9500 m yd. Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was six rounds per minute, but only three rounds per minute could be sustained. 2074 shells were carried to ensure three hours of fire. The guns were convert 6.26 m ftin above the waterline. 
Iena's anti-torpedo boat defences consisted of 16 convert 47 mm in abbr=on 40-calibre QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss Canon de 47 mm Modle 1885 Hotchkiss guns, fitted in platforms on both masts and on the superstructure. They fired a convert 1.49 kg lb adj=on projectile at convert 610 m/s ft/s abbr=on to a maximum range of convert 4000 m yd. Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute, but only seven rounds per minute sustained. 15,000 shells were kept in the magazines.Caresse, pp. 12122 Admiral Marquis criticized the arrangements for the 47&nbsp;mm guns in a 1903 report:
The number of ready-use rounds in insufficient and the hoists are desperately slow. The 47&nbsp;mm guns, much more so than the large and medium-calibre guns, will have to fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible.Caresse, p. 126
Iena mounted four convert 450 mm in adj=on torpedo tubes. Two tubes were submerged and the other two were above the waterline. Twelve Modle 1889 torpedoes were carried, of which four were training models.
Armour
Ina had a complete waterline armour belt of Harvey armor Harvey armour that was convert 2.4 m ftin high and tapered from the maximum thickness of convert 320 mm in abbr=on 1 that covered convert 84 m ftin amidships to convert 230 mm in abbr=on 1 at the ship's ends. The lower edge of this belt was a uniform convert 120 mm in abbr=on in thickness. The upper armour belt was in two strakes, the lower 120&nbsp;mm thick and the upper convert 80 mm in abbr=on. Their combined height was convert 2 m ftin amidships. The maximum thickness of the armoured deck was 80&nbsp;mm and the fore and aft armoured transverse bulkheads were convert 90 mm in abbr=on thick. The main turret armour ranged from convert 278  318 mm in abbr=on 1 in thickness with a convert 50 mm in abbr=on roof and the ammunition shafts were protected by convert 250 mm in abbr=on 1 of armour. The casemates for the 164&nbsp;mm guns were 90&nbsp;mm thick and their ammunition tubes had convert 200 mm in abbr=on 1 of armour.
The conning tower face had convert 298 mm in abbr=on 1 of armour and its sides were 250&nbsp;mm thick. Its roof was protected by two layers of armour, each convert 25 mm in abbr=on thick. The communications tube was protected by 200&nbsp;mm of armour.
History
Image:Iena Bougault.jpg thumb left A postcard of Iena at speed in a calm sea
Ina was laid down at Brest, France Brest on 15 January 1898 after being authorized on 3 April 1897. She was launched on 1 September 1898, but did not enter service until 14 April 1902.Caresse, p. 12223 Ina was assigned to the Second Division of the Mediterranean Squadron and sailed for Toulon five days later. Enroute, the ship suffered from a number of problems with her rudder and had to be docked for repairs once she arrived at her destination. After the completion of the repairs the ship began a series of port visits in France and French North Africa which would be repeated for most of her career.Caresse, p. 125 Iena participated in the fleet review off Naples in AprilMay 1904 on the occasion of the visit of the President of France with King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Afterwards, the Mediterranean Squadron cruised the Levant, calling in Beirut, Suda Bay, Smyrna, Mytilene, Salonika and Piraeus. In April 1906, she was dispatched to provide assistance to Naples after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius#Eruptions in the 20th century Mount Vesuvius.Caresse, p. 128
Loss
On 4 March 1907 Ina was moved into dry dock No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo maintenance of her hull as well as inspection of her rudder shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35 a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of the Ina which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was in a dry dock it was initially impossible to flood the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship ship French battleship Patrie 1903 2, which was moored nearby, fired a shell into the gate of the dry dock in an attempt to flood it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship managed to open the sluice gates. The ship French battleship Suffren, moored in the No. 1 dock beside the Ina, almost capsized under the strength of the blasts.Caresse, p. 130
The origin of the first explosion was traced to Powder B, a nitrocellulose-based propellant used in the ammunition, which tended to become unstable with age, and self-ignite.Caresse, p. 136 It was estimated that the contents of the ship's magazines were comprised of approximately 80% of the suspect powder at the time of the accident. The explosion and loss of 120 lives, including two civilians killed by fragments in the suburb of Pont-Las, triggered a major scandal, dubbed the gunpowder scandal lang-fr l'affaire des poudres. As a result Gaston Thomson, the Navy Minister, was forced to resign.Caresse, pp. 132, 137 A similar accident later caused the loss of the ship French battleship Libert 1905 6 in 1911.Caresse, p. 138
Disposal
The multiple explosions gutted the superstructure between the mainmast and the rear funnel and collapsed the superstructure surrounding the mainmast. The ship's side between Frames 74 and 84 was ripped open down to the lower edge of the armour belt and all the machinery in this area was destroyed. After it was estimated that it would take seven million francs and two years to fully repair the Ina it was decided to decommission the ship and use her as a target ship.Caresse, pp. 129, 134 All useful equipment was removed and she was towed to a mooring off the Porquerolles le des Porquerolles where she was used as a target to test the effectiveness of the latest design of armour-piercing shells beginning on 9 August 1909. After the completion of numerous tests, and with the Ina close to wikt:founder foundering, she was towed to deeper water. While under tow Ina capsized and sank on 2 December 1909. The rights to the wreck were sold and she was subsequently broken up and Marine salvage salvaged between 1912 and 1927.
