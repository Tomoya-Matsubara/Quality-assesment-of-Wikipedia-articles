 The 2007 strikes in France are a series of general strikes in France, mostly in the public sector, which started on November 13, 2007.12 The strike was over President Nicolas Sarkozy's and Prime Minister Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Fillon's attempt to reduce early retirement benefits for 500,000 public employees. Sarkozy has stated that pension reform is the first in a series of measures designed to roll back protections for trade unions in France, and both unions and Sarkozy see the pension strikes as a key political test.3
Cause of the strikes
France's national labour law permits workers in certain hazardous or difficult professions to retire with full pension benefits after 37.5 years rather than 40 years. The Sarkozy administration claims the current pension system allows some public sector workers to retire as early as age 50.4 The government calculated the cost of these early-retirement benefits at $7 billion a year.5
President Nicolas Sarkozy feels that his victory in the 2007 presidential election  gave him a mandate to carry out labour reforms, stating &quot;I said before I was elected what I would do,&quot; and &quot;We will do these reforms because they have to be done.&quot;6 He declared the strikes a test of political will. &quot;I will pursue these reforms to the end,&quot; he said in a speech to the European Parliament. &quot;Nothing will blow me off course.&quot;7
Prime Minister Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Fillon attacked the unions for depriving millions of French people &quot;of their fundamental freedom&lt;U+2014&gt;the freedom of movement and even perhaps to work.&quot;8
Bernard Thibault, the secretary of the Conf&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ration g&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;rale du travail (CGT), France's second-largest labour union, has compared the strikes to the 1995 strikes in France, saying, &quot;The general discontent is as strong as then,&quot; and &quot;We're not trying to copy 1995, but the strike could last.&quot;9 The strikes are open-ended, and there are fears that they could last several more days.10
Beginning of the strikes
 On November 13, 2007, SNCF rail workers and Paris M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro personnel became the first group of workers to commence their strike.11 Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand met with union leaders on November 14, 2007 to try to find a resolution.12 On the first day of the strike, only 90 out of 700 TGV trains were running, and other rail services have also been reduced sharply.13 In Paris, the M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro was only running at 20% capacity and bus services only at 15%.14 But some M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro lines experienced fewer disruptions than expected, leading some observers to conclude that support for the strike was not as strong as unions claimed.15 Line 14 of the Paris m&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro, is piloted automatically, and is unaffected by the drivers' strike, thus bringing the percentage up.
30% of the workers of the 70% state owned Gaz de France and &lt;U+00C9&gt;lectricit&lt;U+00E9&gt; de France, who are also affected by the reform are on strike since November 13, reducing the national electricity production by 8000 MW (roughly 10%), however for the moment there are no fears of power cuts.16 The Op&lt;U+00E9&gt;ra National de Paris, which is subject to the special retirement plan (r&lt;U+00E9&gt;gimes sp&lt;U+00E9&gt;ciaux de retraite) since Louis XIV gave them this right, also cancelled performances. However in a short interview granted to the BBC the director claimed these cancellations were due to insufficient customers, because of travel difficulties incurred by the strikes. Some university students demonstrated and blocked the entrances to their campuses in opposition to plans to allow private funding of Universities.1718 In the University of Nanterre students were forcefully removed by riot police, however this was censored on the national news. A survey by the pro-Sarkozy newspaper Le Figaro and the cable news channel LCI released on November 13 found that about 7 out of 10 people said the strikes were unjustified.19
Minister of Employment, Social Cohesion and Housing Xavier Bertrand, whose portfolio includes labor relations, held several negotiating sessions with the unions throughout the day on November 13 and 14.2021 Bertrand told the unions that pension reform was non-negotiable, but proposed a month-long period of negotiations between the unions and each state-controlled agency to discuss ways to minimize the effects on existing workers.22
Some improvements in mass transit also occurred on November 14. The main M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro commuter lines remained shut, while other lines ran between 20 and 50 percent at normal capacity. However, only a third of Paris buses were running. The Associated Press reported that 150 of the 700 high-speed TGV trains were running, an increase of 60 over the day before.23
On November 18, a demonstration was held by pro-reform and anti-strikes organizations in Paris. They gathered between 8,000 and 20,000 protesters against public transportation strikers, described as &quot;hostage takers&quot;24.
 November 20 marked the 7th day of striking and strikers were joined by other civil servants including teachers, postal workers and newspaper printers. The printers were also protesting against reorganisations within the printing industry. 25 Air traffic control employees were also on strike, causing delays of 45 minutes on flights from the Parisian airports according to ADP. However it was not indicated if these delays are to be added to the usual delays.
During the night from November 20 to November 21, the TGV network was sabotaged by fires, further adding to the delays caused by the 8th day of striking on the 21st. Approximately 30 kilometres of track were damaged, both the unions and the President have condemned these acts. &lt;ref name&quot;BBC sabotage&quot;&gt; 
On November 21, the CGT called for the strikes to stop as the government has allegedly agreed to negotiate. An opinion poll published in the Figaro estimates 2/3rds of the French are against the strike, and the Ministry of Economy has declared the strike is costing the French economy &lt;U+20AC&gt;400 million a day and SNCF &lt;U+20AC&gt;100 million a day. According to the SNCF, the operator of the national train lines 23% of their staff are still on strike, while the RATP operating the Paris M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro, and some suburban trains claims 16% of their staff are on strike. However the service on the Parisian trains and M&lt;U+00E9&gt;tro is still below 25%, due to the fact that most of the strikers are train drivers. 26
On November 21 the number of strikers continued to diminish, and talks were engaged in-between the government and the unions.
Strikes continued on November 22 with the numbers of strikers still diminishing, public transport was still heavily affected however. Following a day of ongoing talks with the government, 42 of the 45 union committees voted to stop the strike, and the RATP and SNCF are announcing almost normal service for November 23, with in-between 70 and 100% of public transport services running. It is said talks could last for a month. 27
Planned strikes
Several additional strikes were also planned. Among them are:
November 29, 2007 - Employees of the  justice system.2829
Telecommunications workers and bankers have also scheduled strikes.30
