Penticton Regional Airport , also known as Penticton Airport, is a regional airport that is located  southwest of Penticton, a city in British Columbia, Canada, which is part of the Okanagan region. It is owned and operated by Transport Canada, serving the South Okanagan, Similkameen and West Kootenay. The facility maintains a restaurant, Sky High Diner, as well as medical facility, accommodation areas, and administrative buildings; food and snacks are also offered.
Initial examination for constructing an airport in Penticton began in 1937. Part of the proposed locations were owned by the Penticton Indian Band, and was thus expropriated in 1949. Rights for temporary public use of the Penticton Regional Airport was conducted in 1945, which was promoted to a permanent airport license in 1956. It has a  runway numbered 16&lt;U+2013&gt;34, garnering approximately 80,000 passengers in 2011, with two accidents and incidents having occurred at it.
The airport has three scheduled flights every day&lt;U+2014&gt;with the exception of Sunday; two flights are provided that day&lt;U+2014&gt;to the Vancouver International Airport provided by Air Canada Express, which is operated by Jazz Air. There have been campaigns for airline WestJet to operate its services at the airport, as well as the expansion of services provided by Air Canada Express at the airport; David Allen is credited as airport manager. Kelowna International Airport has had an impact on traffic at this airport, with over 50 percent of the local community choosing the former over the latter.
History
Initial examination for constructing an airport in Penticton began in 1937 at two locations.1 The proposed areas&lt;U+2014&gt;west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake&lt;U+2014&gt;were owned by the Penticton Indian Band, and was therefore expropriated in 1949, with the preliminary development of the airfield completing in 1941.2 Due to wartime air military transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac could be completed.3 Rights for a temporary public use airport was conducted in 1945 for an operation of 24 hours.4 In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for use at the Penticton Regional Airport to help maintain it.5 Trans-Canada Airlines, which is now known as Air Canada, and Canadian Pacific Air Lines served as the airport's airline after World War II.6
In 1956, Penticton Regional Airport was promoted to a permanent license, replacing the temporary permit.7 The airport's runway was extended in 1959, and a new terminal was built in 1963.8 In 1968, Canadian Pacific Air Lines extended its services for the airport, having scheduled two daily flights at that time, only to be taken over by Pacific Western Airlines the following year.9 However, in 1988, Canadian Airlines ended this.10 This was replaced by Time Air and Air BC airlines; neither airline no longer exists.11
An aviation center was constructed on the airport in 1976, which included a 12-unit motel, flight training school, and aircraft overhaul shop; the last is no longer being maintained.12 Later, a helicopter flight and training club was introduced to Penticton Regional Airport.13 Pacific Coastal Airlines offered its services at the Penticton Regional Airport for twelve months, ending in 2009.14 During this time, the airport obtained 22,000 more customers than it would have done without that airline operating at it.15
It is considered to serve as a port of entry that serves American fishermen coming to Canada.16 The airport has been able to support emergency Boeing 747 landings since the 1970s, but this capability has never been tested.17 Boeing 727-200, Boeing 737-400, Boeing 737-700 and Airbus 320 aircraft have used this airport.18 The facility has been classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada, being staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency.19 An aircraft at this airport can handle no more than 30 passengers.20 Nav Canada has noted that most of the aircraft wind at the Penticton Regional Airport are aimed at the north and south directions.21 It is owned and operated by Transport Canada, with David Allen serving as the airport's manager.2223 The facility has been recognized as a certified airport by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation.24
Kelowna International Airport&lt;U+2014&gt;an international airport operated in nearby city Kelowna&lt;U+2014&gt;has had an impact on this airport, both sharing the same catchment area.25 Over 50 percent of the local area chooses the Kelowna International Airport over the Penticton Regional Airport to fly to the Vancouver International Airport and Calgary International Airport.26 According to research, the South Okanagan region is underserved in terms of airports, due to the amount of people living in the area.27 79,475 people live in the South Okanagan, which totals to 25 percent of the Okanagan area as a whole.28 However, in 1990, it was considered to be the Okanagan's main airport, hence why some questioned the need of expanding the Kelowna International Airport at that time, when its runway was in the process of expansion.29
Facilities
The airport is located on 3000 Airport Road in Penticton, British Columbia, Canada,  southwest of city centre, located off of Highway 97; Penticton is part of the Okanagan region.30313233 It is also located 73 kilometers (45 mi) of the Canada&lt;U+2013&gt;United States border.34 Paid parking, taxis and car rentals are available, but there is no bus service available to the airport; the airport's car rental service is provided by Budget and National Car Rental, while its off-site rental provider is Best Choice Car &amp; Truck Rentals.3536 There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Penticton Regional Airport used by pilot on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location.373839 The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada.40 247 employees work for the Penticton Regional Airport.41
Food and snacks are also available at this airport, as well as medical facility, accommodation areas, and administrative buildings.4243 There is a restaurant provided at the airport's terminal, Sky High Diner, as well as Canada Revenue Agency and Nav Canada locations.44 The airport's aircraft obtain their fuel from Spencer Aviation, which is located at it;45 Shell Canada serves as an aviation dealer for the Penticton Regional Airport.46 The airfield has a  runway aligned 16&lt;U+2013&gt;34.47 This facility maintains a management plan to keep geese off of their runways and properties.48 The Penticton Flying Club operates at the airport, which is a club where children receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot, and learn about the airplanes themselves.495051 The local and upcoming weather of Penticton is observed at this airport's weather station.5253
Airlines and destinations
Penticton Regional Airport is served by Air Canada Express, which is operated by Jazz Air, with flights traveling to the Vancouver International Airport.54 However, it has flown to other locations before, such as Boeing Field&lt;U+2014&gt;an international airport located in King County, Washington, serving the Seattle area&lt;U+2014&gt;and the Kelowna International Airport.55 Flights are provided three times every day,5657 with the exception of Sunday; two flights are provided that day.58 Feedback from the public indicated that an additional daily flights should be added to the airport.59 In 2010, the airport garnered 34,946 aircraft movements,60 while in 2011, it served approximately 80,000 passengers.61
There is a proposal and campaign to bring airline WestJet to the airport,62 which lead to the airport being renamed to &quot;WestJetville&quot; for one day in June 2012.6364 City mayor Dan Ashton stated that the idea was &quot;terrific&quot;, and WestJet executives announced they were willing to offer their services at a regional airport.65 This campaign prompted representatives from the Penticton area to travel to Calgary, so that they can perform a presentation to WestJet executives to convince them to offer their services at the airport.66 In November 2012, the company claimed that they would offer &quot;dramatically&quot; lower prices than Air Canada Express.67 That same month, WestJet executives voted 91 percent in favor of the launch of a regional airline.68 The company's service is planned to start in 2013.69 Ashton has also proposed that Air Canada Express expand its services by adding direct flights to the Calgary International Airport and Edmonton International Airport.707172
There has also been consideration for the airport to provide direct flights to the Montr&lt;U+00E9&gt;al&lt;U+2013&gt;Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport provided by Air Canada.73 It was suggested that Jazz Air could upgrade their aircraft operating at the facility, with it being noted that regional airlines in the United States may be willing to offer services at this airport.74 The flight school Southern Skies Aviation is based at the Penticton Regional Airport; the school closed in 2011 and was reopened shortly after, as it was bought by Kittyhawk A/C Services.757677 The former is also at the airport, serving as an aircraft maintenance centre.787980
Accidents and incidents
On December 22, 1950, a Douglas C-47 aircraft operated by Canadian Pacific Air Lines that departed at the Vancouver International Airport to the Penticton Regional Airport crashed into the Okanagan Mountain due to minimum altitude permissible at that time; when the airplane crashed, it was 26 kilometers (16.3 mi) north of Penticton.81 Two of the airplane's eighteen occupants were injured, all of which were part of the airplane's crew.82 On January 4, 1973, a Convair aircraft operated by Pacific Western Airlines that departed at the Vancouver International Airport to the Penticton Regional Airport was hijacked; the hijacker demanded money, and to be taken to North Vietnam, but was later arrested; there were no fatalities in this incident.83
