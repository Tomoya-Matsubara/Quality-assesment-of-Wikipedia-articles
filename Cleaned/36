Background
 The main event at Bad Blood was fought in a Hell in a Cell between Triple H (Paul Levesque) and Shawn Michaels (Michael Hickenbottom). The buildup to the match began after Backlash, WWE's previous pay-per-view event. On the May 3 edition of Raw, authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, booked a World Heavyweight Championship match, for that episode, between World Heavyweight champion Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels.12 The title match saw Benoit successfully retain the World Heavyweight championship, after interference by Triple H, one of the opponents in the Triple Threat match at Backlash. Triple H managed to perform a Pedigree on both Benoit and Michaels, which led to Triple H stagger Benoit's arm to pin Michaels.34 On the May 10 edition of Raw, Bischoff granted Triple H a World Heavyweight championship match the following week.56 That same night, a match was scheduled between Shelton Benjamin and Triple H. The match resulted in Michaels attacking Triple H, ultimately resulting in Bischoff suspending Michaels for his actions.78 The following week, a Number One contender's Battle Royal match was scheduled, in which the winner would go on to face Chris Benoit for the World Heavyweight championship at Bad Blood.910 One of the participants in the match included Triple H, who after eliminating Shelton Benjamin, was eliminated by Michaels, who was not a participant in the match, as he clotheslined Triple H out of the match.1112 On the May 24 edition of Raw, Triple H pleaded with Bischoff to lift Michaels suspension and reinstate him back in the roster.1314 On the same evening, Michaels confronted Bischoff if he was scheduled in a match with Triple H at Bad Blood, in which Bischoff assured Michaels the match that would take place. Moment afterwards, Michaels was jumped from behind by Triple H, after Michaels attacked Triple H earlier.1516 Bischoff gave orders to Raw superstars to attack Triple H and Michaels, if seen fighting.1718 The roster tried breaking the fight up, but were unsuccessful in doing so.1920 The result of the fight gave Bischoff the authority to schedule Triple H and Michaels in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood.2122
One of the featured preliminary matches was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Chris Benoit defended the championship against Kane. On the May 17 edition of Raw, Kane won a twenty man battle royal to receive a World Heavyweight Championship title shot against Chris Benoit at Bad Blood.2324 The following week, Kane revealed that he envied Benoit for having the World Heavyweight championship and concluded that he would get the World Heavyweight.2526 On the May 31 edition of Raw, Kane was scheduled in a match against Eugene (Nick Dinsmore). The match ended in a disqualification, after Kane hit Eugene with a steel chair.2728 After the match ended, Kane performed a chokeslam, when a wrestler grasps their opponent's neck, lifts them up, and slams them to the mat, on Eugene, which prompted Kane to set him up for a belly-to-belly piledriver. Benoit, however, made the save.2930 The following week on Raw, a handicap match was scheduled between Benoit and Edge (Adam Copeland) facing off against La R&lt;U+00E9&gt;sistance (Sylvain Grenier and Rob&lt;U+00E9&gt;rt Conway [Rob Conway]) and Kane. The match saw Kane perform a chokeslam on Benoit, thus pinning Benoit for the win.3132
 The other featured preliminary match was Randy Orton versus Shelton Benjamin in a singles match for Orton's Intercontinental Championship. On the May 17 edition of Raw, Randy Orton, who was a heel, a bad guy, bragged about how he was the company's longest reigning Intercontinental champion in the last seven years.33 Shelton Benjamin interrupted Orton's speech and challenged Orton to an Intercontinental championship match. The challenge, however, was denied by Orton, in which prompted Benjamin to attack Orton.3435 The following week, Orton was a guest in Chris Jericho's (Christopher Irvine) segment, The Highlight Reel. In the segment, Orton stayed true to his word, saying that he would not grant Benjamin an Intercontinental title match. This led to Orton turning his attention towards Jericho and stating that he would enjoy adding Jericho to the list of legends that he has killed off, prior to Orton defeating legends in a &quot;Legend versus Legend Killer&quot; match.3637 An all-out brawl quickly ensued between Jericho and Orton. The brawl brought out fellow Evolution member Batista (David Bautista, Jr.), as he ran down to make it two on one. Benjamin also made his way to the ring and evened the sides. Bischoff announced that the battling that took place, would become in the form of a tag team encounter. The match saw the team of Benjamin and Jericho defeat Orton and Batista.3839 On the May 31 edition of Raw, it was announced that Orton would defend the Intercontinental championship against Benjamin at Bad Blood.4041 That same episode, Orton faced Benjamin in a non-title match, in which Benjamin got the win over Orton.4243 The following week on Raw, a match was booked between Benjamin and Batista. During the match, Orton came to ringside and distracted Benjamin, the distraction led to Batista performing a sitdown powerbomb, in which the wrestler drops into a sitting position as they slam their opponent down to the mat, and gaining the pinfall victory over Benjamin. After the match, all three members of Evolution triple-teamed Benjamin, with Orton finishing the assault, as he hit Benjamin with the title to the face.4445
