Interstate 15 (abbreviated I-15) runs north-south  through Southern California. It is a major thoroughfare for traffic between Southern California and Las Vegas. It is also the main route for traffic between San Diego and the Inland Empire.
Route description
I-15's state (and national) southern terminus is I-8 in San Diego. From I-8, it runs north through Escondido in San Diego County, passing MCAS Miramar. The highway passes through hilly terrain and avocado farmland before entering Riverside County near the rapidly-growing community of Temecula. In Murieta, I-15 splits from its first (and only) spur route in California, I-215, which runs through the two largest cities in the Inland Empire: San Bernardino and Riverside. I-15 runs along the eastern edge of the Santa Ana Mountains, passing the community of Lake Elsinore. The freeway continues through the suburban areas in the western Inland Empire, passing Corona and Ontario. The highway then heads northward and upward through Cajon Pass, a historic pass for travelers heading to Los Angeles from the north and east. North of the pass, I-15 traverses the Mojave Desert cities of Hesperia and Victorville. The freeway passes through mostly unspoiled desert for  before reaching Barstow, the last city I-15 passes through in California. The only other settlement I-15 passes through in its final  is Baker, known as the &quot;Gateway to Death Valley&quot; and is home to the world's largest thermometer. The sign for the Zzyzx exit, the alphabetically last place name in the United States, is a well-known landmark along the drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on I-15. I-15 leaves California near the gambling town Primm, Nevada (formerly Stateline, Nevada).
History
 I-15 was initially planned to run from I-10 in San Bernardino along the current I-215 alignment then up through the Cajon Pass and on to Las Vegas. California successfully argued the addition south to San Diego, suggesting that the freeway would connect the major military bases former March AFB and former NAS Miramar. US-395 was then signed TEMP-15 and the &quot;old&quot; I-15 between Devore and San Bernardino became I-215.
I-15 replaced US-395 between San Diego and Temecula. The highway replaced US-66 between San Bernardino and Barstow. I-15 north of Barstow replaced US-91.
I-15 Express Lanes
The I-15 Express Lanes are high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes located in the median of Interstate 15 between California State Route 163 and California State Route 56 in San Diego.
Future aspirations
I-15 Major Improvements Project
Most of Interstate 15 is undergoing major improvements from Devore to the Nevada State Line, beginning in 2002, costing $349 million. This project will improve traffic flow on the heavily traveled highway for those going to and from Las Vegas. Most of the construction will be completed by Winter 2009.  Projects include:
Adding truck lanes on hills (39 miles at various locations)
Repave 76 miles of I-15 at various locations
Renovate and rehabilitate the rest area between Baker and the Nevada State Line (Valley Wells Rest Area)
Reconstructing bridges in Baker
Move the agriculture inspection station from Yermo to the Nevada State Line and include a truck weigh station
Devore 2 Project
Since August 14, 2006, the Devore Interchange (I-15 and I-215) have undergone a $26 million project to replace deteriorating roadway on the outer lanes in both directions on I-15. Also, a 3-mile truck climbing lane will be added on the northbound I-15 from the I-15/I-215 interchange. The project was completed on January 8, 2007.
Names
I-15 carries several names as it passes through California. Between I-5 and I-805 (a future part of I-15, now signed as SR-15 because several off-ramps and on-ramps are not built to Interstate Standards), the freeway is known simply as Wabash, most likely because its route runs along the old route of Wabash Street in San Diego.1 Route 15 between I-805 and SR-91 is officially known as Escondido Freeway.2 The stretch of I-15 in San Diego County north of SR-163 is known also as the &quot;Cabrillo Freeway&quot;. I-15 between SR-163 and Miramar Road is known as the Semper Fi Highway in recognition of the nearby MCAS Miramar.3
In California, I-15 has at least five different names throughout its length. From its southern terminus to the Riverside-San Diego county line, it is named the Escondido Freeway. The portion of the Escondido Freeway passing through the Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar is also known as the Semper Fi Highway. From the San Diego county line to California 74 (Ortega Highway) in Lake Elsinore, it is named the Temecula Valley Freeway. From CA 74 to Limonite Avenue in Riverside County, it is known as the Corona Freeway. From Limonite Avenue to the northern junction with the I-215 spur in Devore, it is called the Ontario Freeway. From the I-215 junction to the Interstate 40 junction in Barstow, it is named the Barstow Freeway. Finally, from Barstow to the Nevada state line it is named the Mojave Freeway.

Exit list
The list of exits on Interstate 15 are from south to north. Note, as of 2006, California is still in the process of numbering freeway exits; many still have not been numbered yet. Also, the route of I-15 officially continues south from Interstate 8 to Interstate 5; however, it is signed as CA-15 instead. For purposes of continuity, this list starts at the official start of I-15 as an Interstate highway, at I-8.
There are a total of 400 exits along the entire I-15.
Postmiles are derived from5 and exit numbers derived from6.
