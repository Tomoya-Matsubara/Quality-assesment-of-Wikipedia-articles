David Bridges (born 22 September, 1982 in Huntingdon) is an English footballer who plays for Stevenage Borough as a midfielder.
Club career
Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges began his career with local side Cambridge United, progressing through the club's youth system.1 He broke into the first-team towards the latter stages of the 2001-02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1-0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium.2 He played six further games in the same season,3 scoring his first goal for the Cambridgeshire outfit in a 2-1 home win against Tranmere Rovers.4
Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002-03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once.5 However, a persistent ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards.6 He returned to first-team action in a 1-0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003,7 and played a further 22 times for the U's throughout the 2003-04 campaign.8 However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract with manager Herv&lt;U+00E9&gt; Renard.
Bridges trialled at a number of clubs before the start of the 2004-05 season, most notably Chesterfield and Northampton Town, without successfully securing a deal.910 After a short stint in Latvia for FK Riga, Bridges returned to England to join Cambridgeshire side Histon in March 2005.11 He scored twice for Histon,12 making eight appearances and helping the club achieve promotion to the Conference South in his two months at the club.13 He left Histon at the end of the season, and subsequently earned himself a one-year contract to re-join Cambridge United, following a successful trial at the club.14
He made his second debut for Cambridge in a 1-0 defeat at Forest Green Rovers,15 and scored in the following two games against both Hereford United and Accrington Stanley.1617 Bridges was a first-team regular throughout the 2005-06 season, and played in 38 matches, scoring seven goals from midfield.18 Consequently, he won the 'Player of the season' award at Cambridge in the same season, and more importantly earned a contract extension in May 2006.19 He continued playing regularly under new manager Jimmy Quinn in the 2006-07 season, scoring three times in 30 appearances.20 However, he was released by Quinn in May 2007 as he re-vamped the entire squad.21
Two months later, Bridges joined Conference North side Kettering Town on a one-year deal.22 He was instrumental for the Northamptonshire club throughtout Kettering's 2007-08 league campaign, scoring 11 goals in 39 appearances to help guide Kettering to promotion to the Conference National.2324 He was offered a new contract by manager Mark Cooper, which was rejected, as he opted to join Craig Westcarr and Gary Mills at Stevenage Borough.2526 However, Bridges suffered a knee injury and missed the first half of the 2008-09 season. He eventually made his debut for the Hertfordshire outfit in a 1-1 draw against Oxford United in December 2008, scoring Stevenage's goal.27 He played 19 games, scoring six goals before he suffered an injury in another 1-1 draw against Oxford United at Broadhall Way, which ultimately ruled him out for the rest of the season.2829
