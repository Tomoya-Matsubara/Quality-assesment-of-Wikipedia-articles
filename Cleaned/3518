Carnival Films is a British television production company, founded by Brian Eastman in 1978 as Picture Partnership Productions Limited and run by Gareth Neame since 2005. The company swiftly built up a strong reputation as an independent production company of theatre, film and television drama. It has produced television series such as Jeeves and Wooster, Poirot, Traffik, and As If as well as Richard Attenborough's critically acclaimed feature film Shadowlands starring Anthony Hopkins. More recently the company has produced popular long-running drama series such as Hotel Babylon (BBC One) and Rosemary &amp; Thyme (ITV) as well as programmes such as Midnight Man, Enid (one of BBC Four&lt;U+2019&gt;s highest rating dramas of all time)1 and Whitechapel (the highest rating new UK drama in 2009).2
In August 2008, Neame sold Carnival to NBC Universal under the Studio&lt;U+2019&gt;s new strategy of moving productions outside America and produced The Philanthropist for NBC Studios shortly thereafter. The acquisition of Carnival marked NBC's first UK acquisition and includes Carnival's back catalogue.3
In 2010 Carnival produced the first series of Julian Fellowes&lt;U+2019&gt; drama Downton Abbey for ITV, and has been commissioned to produce another. It has also made William Boyd's Any Human Heart for Channel 4 as well as a sequel to Whitechapel.
