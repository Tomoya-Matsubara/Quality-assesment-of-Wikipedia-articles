Emery Molyneux (, EM-(&lt;U+0259&gt;-)ree MO-l&lt;U+0259&gt;-noe) (died June 1598) was an Elizabethan maker of globes, mathematical instruments and ordnance. His terrestrial and celestial globes, first published in 1592, were the first to be made in England and the first to be made by an Englishman.
Known as a mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments such as compasses and hourglasses, Molyneux became acquainted with many prominent men of his age, including the explorers Thomas Cavendish, John Davis, Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, the writer Richard Hakluyt, and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright. Davis probably introduced Molyneux to his own patron, the London merchant William Sanderson, who largely financed the construction of the globes. When completed, the globes were presented to Elizabeth I. Larger globes were acquired by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions, while smaller ones were purchased as practical navigation aids for sailors and students. The globes were the first to be made in such a way that they were unaffected by the humidity at sea, and they came into general use on ships.
Molyneux emigrated to Amsterdam with his wife in 1596–1597. He succeeded in interesting the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, in a cannon he had invented but died suddenly in June 1598, apparently in poverty. The globe-making industry in England died with him.
Only six Molyneux globes are believed to be still in existence. Three are in England, of which one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is owned by Middle Temple and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.
Globe-maker
Construction
Emery Molyneux is regarded as being both the maker of the first terrestrial and celestial globes in England, and the first English globe-maker.1 Little is known about the man himself. Petruccio Ubaldini, an Italian calligraphist, illuminator and ambassador2 who was acquainted with him, said he was &quot;of obscure and humble family background&quot;.3 It seems likely that he was the &quot;Emery Molynox&quot; who was presented to the Worshipful Company of Stationers as the apprentice of one William Cooke in October 1557.4 By the 1580s he had a reputation for being a mathematician and maker of mathematical instruments, with a workshop in Lambeth, on the south bank of the Thames.5 Richard Polter, in his book The Pathway to Perfect Sayling (1605),6 mentioned that Molyneux had been a skilful maker of compasses and hourglasses.7

Through his trade, Molyneux was known to the explorers Thomas Cavendish, John Davis, Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, the writer Richard Hakluyt, and the mathematicians Robert Hues and Edward Wright.8 The construction of globes by Molyneux appears to have been suggested by Davis to his patron William Sanderson, a London merchant who has been described as &quot;one of the most munificent and patriotic of merchant-princes of London in the days of Elizabeth I&quot;.9 Sanderson readily agreed to bear the manufacturing costs,10 and financed initial production of the globes with a capital investment of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,00011 (almost &lt;U+00A3&gt;160,000 as at 2007).12
Terrestrial globes
In making his terrestrial globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea)13 and pilots (navigational handbooks).14 such as the ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies he gave to Thomas Harriot in 1590.1516 He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians.17 It is likely, for instance, that he obtained information for a legend in Spanish18 on the terrestrial globe about the Solomon Islands from Sir Walter Raleigh, who was informed of it by Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa. In 1584 Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it, was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks after being captured while on a journey to Europe by an English fleet under Raleigh.19
Molyneux accompanied Francis Drake on his 1577–1580 circumnavigation of the world; Ubaldini reported that &quot;[h]e himself has been in those seas and on those coasts in the service of the same Drake&quot;.20 A legend in Latin on the terrestrial globe explaining why Molyneux had left out the polar lands and corrected the distance across the Atlantic Ocean between The Lizard and Cape Race in Newfoundland concluded:
Jodocus Hondius (1563–1612), the Flemish engraver and cartographer who printed the gores of Molyneux's globes – from Atlas or a Geographicke Description of the World (1636)
On the terrestrial globe, tracks of the voyages of Francis Drake and Thomas Cavendish around the world are marked by red and blue lines respectively. These lines were applied when the globe was first made, for they are referred to in a description of Molyneux's globes in Blundeville His Exercises (1594)2122 by Thomas Blundeville, a country gentleman who was an enthusiastic student of astronomy and navigation.23 Thomas Cavendish also appears to have helped Molyneux with his globes, or it is possible that Molyneux accompanied him on his 1587 voyage around the world, which returned to England on 9 September 1588.24 In 1889, Sir Clements Markham, an English explorer, author and geographer, pointed out that a Latin legend on the terrestrial globe placed off the Patagonian coast states: &quot;Thomas Caundish 18 Dec. 1587 h&lt;U+00E6&gt;c terra sub nostris oculis primum obtulit sub latitud 47 cujus seu admodum salubris Incol&lt;U+00E6&gt; maturi ex parte proceri sunt gigantes et vasti magnitudinis&quot;.25 However, Helen Wallis, former Map Curator of the British Library, wrote in 1951 that this was unlikely as Molyneux had incorrectly plotted the course of Cavendish's journey in the East Indian Archipelago.26 Nonetheless she suggests that, judging from another legend on the globe, he appears to have sailed on at least one if not all of John Davis's voyages.27
Mathematician and cartographer Edward Wright28 assisted Molyneux in plotting coastlines on the terrestrial globe and translated some of the legends into Latin, and on 10 April 1591 the astrologer and physician Simon Forman visited his workshop and taught him how to find longitude.29 It appears that after Molyneux had prepared the manuscript gores (that is, the flat map segments that would later be attached to the globes) he had them printed by the celebrated Flemish engraver and cartographer Jodocus Hondius, who lived in London between 1584 and 1593 to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. This can be discerned from the phrase &quot;Iodocus Hon: / dius Flan. sc. / 1592&quot; on the celestial globe that appears together with Sanderson's coat of arms and a dedication to the Queen dated 1592. Molyneux's own name is set out on the Middle Temple terrestrial globe in the phrase &quot;Emerius Mulleneux Angl.' / sumptibus Gulielmi— / Sandersoni Londin&lt;U+0113&gt;: / sis descripsit&quot; (&quot;Emery Molyneux of England, at the expense of William Sanderson of London, described this&quot;).30
Celestial globes
Molyneux's celestial globe was virtually a copy of Gerardus Mercator's globe of 1551, which itself was based on a globe of 1537 by Gemma Frisius that Mercator had helped to construct.31 To the constellations featured on Mercator's globe, Molyneux added the Southern Cross and Southern Triangle, rather too far to the west of their true positions. His source appears to have been Andrea Corsali's diagram of the Antarctic sky published32 in 1550.33
Molyneux's globes were the first to be constructed in such a way that they were unaffected by humidity at sea. They were made of flour-paste, which was an unusual material for the time. Simon Forman remarked that Molyneux's moulding or casting process was &quot;the only way to caste [anything] whatsoever in perfecte forme... and yt is the perfectest and trewest waie of all wayes... and this was the wai that Mullenax did use to cast flowere [flour] in the verie forme&quot;.3435
Publication
The title page of Richard Hakluyt's 1589 work The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation, which announced the impending publication of Molyneux's terrestrial globe
The impending publication of Molyneux's terrestrial globe was announced by Hakluyt at the end of the preface to his 1589 work The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation.36 Referring to the map that was inserted into the volume – a reproduction of the &quot;Typus Orbis Terrarum&quot; engraved by Franciscus Hogenberg for Abraham Ortelius' Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570),37 he wrote:
Molyneux's progress in manufacturing the globes was reported by Ubaldini in letters to the Duke of Milan. Ubaldini was in attendance when Molyneux presented a pair of manuscript globes to Elizabeth I at Greenwich in July 1591,38 and noted that &quot;he gave her the globe to let her see at a glance how much of the world she could control by means of her naval forces&quot;.39 According to Wallis, the printed globes were published after some delay in the late months of 1592 or some time between January and March 1593.40 Sanderson arranged entertainments at his home in Newington Butts to present these globes to the Queen. His son, also named William, recorded that on being given the terrestrial globe she remarked, &quot;The whole earth, a present for a Prince...&quot;. When she was presented the celestial globe at a second entertainment, she said, &quot;Thou hast presented me with the Heavens also: God guide me, to Govern my part of the one, that I may enjoy but a mansion place in this other.&quot;41
Shortly after, several treatises were published to describe the Molyneux globes and provide guides to their use. Molyneux himself wrote a treatise, now lost, entitled The Globes Celestial and Terrestrial Set Forth in Plano (1592) which was published by Sanderson.42 Also in 1592, Thomas Hood, a London-based mathematics lecturer, who had written a 1590 work on the use of celestial globes,43 published The Vse of Both the Globes, Celestiall and Terrestriall.44 This was followed by two 1594 works, one of which was Blundeville's book. The other, Tractatus de Globis et Eorum Usu (Treatise on Globes and their Use, 1594),45 was published by the mathematician Robert Hues;46 the work went into 13 printings and was translated from Latin into Dutch, English and French. In 1599, Edward Wright published Certaine Errors in Navigation,47 in which he wrote, among other things, about the use of the terrestrial and celestial globes that had been developed by Molyneux.
The largest and most prestigious globes were priced at up to &lt;U+00A3&gt;20 each; these were purchased by royalty, noblemen and academic institutions. Globes were purchased by the Warden of All Souls College and Thomas Bodley for their libraries at Oxford, and William Sanderson presented the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge each with a pair.48 A Molyneux globe was also the inaugural gift to the Shrewsbury School library by the public preacher Thomas Laughton.49 In addition, smaller globes intended as practical navigation aids for sailors and students costing as low as &lt;U+00A3&gt;2 were made – no examples of these exist today.5051 It is known that Sanderson presented a lesser globe to Robert Cecil in 1595, together with Hues' &quot;Latin booke that teacheth the use of my great globes&quot;.5253 Markham, who was the editor of the 1889 reprint of an English edition of Hues' work, noted: &quot;The appearance of the globes naturally created a great sensation, and much interest was taken in appliances which were equally useful to the student and to the practical navigator.&quot;54 For navigators, the globe supplied methods of finding the place of the sun, latitude, course and distance, amplitudes and azimuths, time and declination, by inspection. This was a great boon to navigation and the globe came into very general use on ships.55 In the dedication of his 1595 book The Seamans Secrets56 to the Lord High Admiral, Charles Howard, the 1st Earl of Nottingham, navigator John Davis spoke of &quot;the mechanical practices drawn from the Arts of Mathematick, [in which] our Country doth yield men of principal excellency&quot;, and referred specifically to &quot;M. Emery Molyneux for the exquisite making of Globes bodies&quot;.57

Later life
In the 1590s, Molyneux sought Elizabeth I's patronage for the production of a cannon, which he described as his &quot;new invention, of shot and artillery, to be used principally in naval warfare: protection of ports and harbours, a new shot to discharge a thousand musket shot; with wildfire not to be quenched&quot;.58 In 1595 the merchant Robert Parkes purchased coal, saltpetre, pitch, oils and waxes for him, possibly for the cannon. In March 1593 Molyneux was issued with a royal warrant and the matter was considered by the Privy Council on 4 November 1596, when the Lord Admiral was urged &quot;to speak to Molyneux, Bussy and the two Engelberts about their offensive engines&quot;59 as part of measures to defend England's south coast. It appears the request was ignored. On 27 September 159460 the Queen granted Molyneux a gift of &lt;U+00A3&gt;200 and an annuity of &lt;U+00A3&gt;50, but he chose to surrender the latter when some time between March or April 1596 and 4 June 159761 he and his wife Anne emigrated to Amsterdam, Holland.62 Wallis has conjectured that he took with him the printing plates for the globes and sold them to Hondius, who had returned to Amsterdam in 1593.63
Why Molyneux left England for Holland is unclear. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests it was to be able to personally distribute his globes to European princes, for Amsterdam was then quickly establishing itself as the centre of globe- and map-making.64 However, this could not have been his intention if he had sold the globes' plates to Hondius. It is possible that he had decided to concentrate on manufacturing ordnance. On 26 January 1598, the States-General, the parliament of the United Provinces, showed interest in Molyneux's cannon and granted him a 12-year privilege on an invention. On 6 June he lodged a second application, but died in Amsterdam almost immediately. His wife was granted administration of his estate in England later that month. It seems that Molyneux died in poverty, as Anne was granted a Dutch compassionate pension of 50 florins on 9 April 1599. Molyneux apparently had no surviving family, and the English globe-making industry died with him.65 No other globes appear to have been manufactured in England until the appearance in the 1670s of globes by Robert Morden and William Berry, and by Joseph Moxon.66 However, over 40 years after Molyneux's death, William Sanderson the younger wrote that his globes were &quot;yet in being, great and small ones, Celestiall and Terrestriall, in both our Universities and severall Libraries (here, and beyond Seas)&quot;.67
Influence
Edward Wright's &quot;Chart of the World on Mercator's Projection&quot; (c. 1599), otherwise known as the Wright–Molyneux map
Cartography
In the third volume of the greatly-expanded version of his book The Principal Navigations, Voiages, Traffiques and Discoueries of the English Nation (1600),68 Hakluyt published what is known today as the Wright–Molyneux Map. Created by Edward Wright and based on Molyneux's terrestrial globe, it was the first map to use Wright's improvements on Mercator's projection.69
Having, it is believed, purchased the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius was granted a ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe, and in that year produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis.70 Despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years from 31 October 1598.71 He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius's world map of 1608 on the Mercator projection relied on Molyneux's globe as it bears a number of legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from the globe.72
In his globes of 1612, van Langeren incorporated the improvements to Molyneux's globe that Hondius the Elder had made, and it is believed that the Hondius globes spurred Willem Blaeu to start constructing his large globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore had an indirect influence on Dutch globe-making.73
Culture
The appearance of Molyneux's globes had a significant influence on the culture of his time. In Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the protagonists, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: &quot;No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out countries in her.&quot;74 The jest gained its point from the globes' publication, and Shakespeare may have personally seen them.75 Elizabethan dramatist Thomas Dekker wrote in one of his plays published in The Gull's Horn-book (1609):76
It has been suggested that the Lord Chamberlain's Men, the playing company that Shakespeare worked for as an actor and playwright for most of his career, named their playing space built in 1599 the Globe Theatre as a response to growing enthusiasm for terrestrial and celestial globes that had been stimulated by those manufactured by Molyneux.77
In Twelfth Night (1600–1601), Shakespeare alluded to the Wright–Molyneux Map by having Maria say teasingly of Malvolio: &quot;He does smile his face into more lynes, than is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies.&quot;78
The globes today
It appears that only six Molyneux globes are in existence today, two terrestrial globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum originally had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but this is believed to have been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and a celestial globe, is presently owned by Middle Temple in London and is displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.79
Petworth House globe
Petworth House, West Sussex, in 1986
A terrestrial globe80 was discovered in Lord Leconfield's library at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex, in July 1949. According to the tradition of the Wyndham family, who are descended from Henry Percy, the 9th Earl of Northumberland, the globe belonged to Sir Walter Raleigh who gave it to Northumberland when they were imprisoned together in the Tower of London. Northumberland, known as the &quot;Wizard Earl&quot; for his interest in scientific and alchemical experiments and his library,81 was suspected of being involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 as his relative Thomas Percy was one of the conspirators. Raleigh was imprisoned in the Tower for treason due to his alleged involvement in the Main Plot against James I. Although the theory is supported by circumstantial evidence, a number of entries in Northumberland's accounts relating to the mending of globes, one dating back to 1596, suggest that the Molyneux globe belonged to him from the beginning and was not Raleigh's.82 It is, however, almost certain that the globe spent many years in the Tower before being transferred to Petworth House where Northumberland was confined upon his release in 1621.83
The Petworth House globe, presently in the North Gallery, is valuable for being the only Molyneux terrestrial globe existing in its original 1592 state. One of Molyneux's &quot;great globes&quot;, measuring  in diameter, it was reported in 1952 to have been in poor condition despite restoration by the British Museum the previous year.84 The northern hemisphere was darkened by dirt and badly rubbed in places to the extent that it was hard to read. Some parts of it, and large sections of the southern hemisphere, are missing altogether.85 The restoration work revealed that the globe is weighted with sand and made from layers of small pieces of paper overlaid with a coat of plaster about  thick. On top of this is another layer of paper over which the gores are pasted. The globe retains its wooden horizon circle and brass meridian ring, but its hour circle and index are missing.86 Further restoration took place between 1995 and 1997.87
The globe was exhibited at the Royal Geographical Society in 1951 and 1952.88
Middle Temple globes
The earliest reference to the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes89 being in the possession of the Middle Temple is a bill in the accounts for 11 April 1717 for &quot;repairing the globes in the library&quot;.90 Markham's view was that Robert Ashley (1565–1641), a barrister of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent geographer, was likely to have owned the globes and left them to the Inn together with his books in his will. Ashley's books formed the nucleus of the Inn's original library, and included copies of the second edition of Hues' Tractatus de Globis and other works on cosmography.91 On the other hand, Wallis has said that Markham's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not specifically mentioned in the will. She feels that they were probably acquired on their publication in 1603.92
A drawing of Middle Temple Library in 1892 by Herbert Railton
The celestial globe is dated 1592 but the terrestrial globe bears the year 1603, the only example of its kind.93 Wallis has surmised that the globes were made by Hondius in Amsterdam in 1603 after receiving an order from England, perhaps from the Middle Temple itself. The celestial globe was made from the original 1592 printing plates, while the terrestrial globe was produced using revised plates that were redated to 1603.94 The Petworth House terrestrial globe of 1592 differs from the Middle Temple one in that the latter incorporated Raleigh's discoveries in Guiana95 and provided new place-names in Brazil and Peru, and on the continent of Africa. An island marked &quot;Corea&quot; off the coast of China was also added. The most extensive revision was that to the Northeast Passage, which was amended to take into account discoveries made on Willem Barentsz's third voyage to Novaya Zemlya in 1596. It appears that the revisions to the original plates of Molyneux's globe were completed by 1597, as no discoveries after that year are included.96 It is possible that Molyneux helped Hondius to update the plates in 1596 or 1597. For instance, if Hondius had obtained a copy of Raleigh's map of Guiana, Molyneux was most likely his source.97 Unlike the Petworth House globe, the Middle Temple globes are heavily varnished. The varnish could have been first applied as early as 1818 when the globes were repaired by J. and W. Newton, and they were certainly varnished by Messrs. Holland Hannen &amp; Cubitts, Ltd. during maintenance work performed in 1930.98
At the start of World War II, the globes were sent to Beaconsfield and stored with part of the Wallace Collection at Hall Barn in the care of Lady Burnham. They were brought back to London in 1945, and were at one stage placed in the King's Library on loan to the British Museum.99100 The globes were installed in the position where they now stand in Middle Temple Library when the current library building opened in 1958.101 In 2003, the globes were loaned to the National Maritime Museum for an exhibition commemorating the life of Elizabeth I.102
In 2004, Middle Temple proposed the sale of the Molyneux globes, valued at over &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million, to create a scholarship fund for the education and training of needy would-be barristers. Its members eventually decided by a large majority against such a move. There was also a general feeling that the globes should be made more accessible to those wishing to see them.103
The Middle Temple's Molyneux globes are the subject of a book-length project, The Molyneux Globes: Mathematical Practice and Theory, by Dr. Lesley B. Cormack, Professor and Chair of the Department of History and Classics of the Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta.104 The project examines the community of mathematicians, natural philosophers, instrument-makers, and gentlemen-virtuosi that developed around the creation of the Molyneux globes, particularly the histories of four men who wrote treatises about the globes and the larger mathematical community.105
Hessisches Landesmuseum globe
The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were inherited from the collection of William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, who was a pioneer of astronomical research. As William died in 1592 it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. The globes were first mentioned in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel in the reign of Landgrave Frederick III in 1765.106 Only a celestial globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.
