History
Eurovision Song Contest 2007
 In late March 2007, the jury commission of Russian national TV channelÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Channel One were choosing Russia's representatives for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007. To everyone's surprise, the commission choose a fully unknown band named Serebro, which managed to overcome some famous native artists. In the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, Dima Bilan with his song &quot;Never Let You Go&quot; reached the second place which automatically allowed Serebro to perform in the 2007 final.
On the 12th of May, Serebro performed as number 15 in the final. They got 12 points from Armenia, Belarus, and Estonia and 10 points from Ukraine. The winner, Serbia, gave them 7 points. Serebro received third place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, with a total of 207 points. Serebro later said: &quot;We are happy because of our third place. But, the most important thing is that we weren't there because of ourselves, it was for our fans, Russia and Russian people&quot;. The performance in Helsinki became their first official release and first concert for an audience.
2007&lt;U+2014&gt;2008: Opiumroz
After the success at Eurovision Song Contest 2007 in Helsinki, Serebro rapidly became one of the most popular bands in Russia. Since Summer 2007, the group has visited various concerts and events in Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Poland, Uzbekistan, and Belarus. All band singles, without their real titles, are named Song#1, #2, #3, etc. As the group and their management have stated, so it will be easier to recall their songs.
Soon after the Eurovision contest, Serebro released &quot;Song #1&quot; as a single CD, which contained 13 different versions of &quot;Song #1&quot; marked by colours, as well as an extended version of the video. The girls then released a Russian version of &quot;Song #1&quot;, called &quot;&lt;U+041F&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt; #1&quot;. It was Serebro's first Russian single. This song has two versions, original and censored. In July 2007, the group released their second song, &quot;&lt;U+0414&gt;&lt;U+044B&gt;&lt;U+0448&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot;, which is also titled &quot;Song #2&quot;. It became as popular as &quot;Song#1&quot; and climbed up to the top of the chart. Later in October, a video for &quot;&lt;U+0414&gt;&lt;U+044B&gt;&lt;U+0448&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot; was released.
At the RMA awards in early October 2007, Serebro performed a new song titled &quot;What's Your Problem?&quot;, which is still unconfirmed as an official single and the song number of it is still unknown. Serebro was nominated in four categories at the MTV RMA 2007 awards: Best Pop-project, Best Debut, Best Song and Best Video. The voting results on the Internet allowed them to win the award for Best Debut. In December 2007, Serebro won another award at the Golden Gramophone Awards, a big music award ceremony organized by the biggest radio broadcaster in Russia, CIS. Serebro also won a World Music Award in 2007 for the best selling Russian artist. Unlike previous eastern European winners of a World Music Award (e.g. Ruslana from Ukraine in 2004 and Dima Bilan for Russia in 2006), Serebro did not perform at the event.
In late February, Serebro performed &quot;&lt;U+0416&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot; on &lt;U+0417&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+044D&gt;&lt;U+0437&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;, a popular television programme in Russia, featuring artists singing patriotic songs. Originally written as a poem by Rasul Gamzatov &quot;&lt;U+0416&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot; is one of the most famous Russian songs coming out of World War II. On May 13, 2008 Serebro announced on their official website that they will be releasing their third official single, called &quot;&lt;U+041E&gt;&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&quot;. The song premiered on a Russian morning radio show BrigadaU on Europa Plus radio and until March 17, 2008 Europa Plus held exclusive rights to play the song. The girls also announced an English version of &quot;&lt;U+041E&gt;&lt;U+043F&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&quot; titled &quot;Why&quot;.
In 2008 the group continued their work on their first album, Opiumroz,16 which had a projected release date of October 17.17 Unfortunately, there was a delay in the release of their debut album as there were some problems in the track list18 In November, the girls released the new song, &quot;&lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0436&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;, &lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; M&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot; (&quot;Say, Don't be silent&quot;).19 In November 2008, Serebro was awarded by MTV RMA Awards for the Best Group.20
2009&lt;U+2014&gt;present: Line-up change and second album
After a number of delays with their debut album, Opiumroz, it was finally released on 25 April 2009, and was presented at the band's concert on Poklonnaya Hill.21 Serebro was supported by other musicians, including Russian entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 Yulia Savicheva;22 Opiumroz was the result of two years recording.23
On 18 June 2009 it was announced that Marina Lizorkina had left the band, due to both financial and personal reasons.24 Lizorkina was replaced by Anastasia Karpova.25 On 24 June 2009 Serebro announced they had finished work on their new music video for their fifth single &quot;&lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&quot; (English: Sweet) which was released in Russian as well as in English under the title &quot;Like Mary Warner&quot;. This single is not featured on the band's debut album and is the first single to feature the work of the latest Serebro member, Anastasia Karpova.26 Serebro participated in the New Wave Festival in J&lt;U+016B&gt;rmala, Latvia, on 29 July 2009 with their song &quot;&lt;U+0421&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0436&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;, &lt;U+043D&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; &lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&quot; and a cover version of &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; by Pink.27
On 29 March 2010 Serebro's official website invited women between the ages of 18 and 30 with a &quot;non-standard appearance (piercings, dreadlocks, braids, tattoos, vivid hair color, etc)&quot; to send in applications to feature in their new video and are invited to do so until April 3, 201028 in preparation for the filming of a new music video which began 4 April 2010. The title of the song was revealed to be &quot;&lt;U+041D&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; B&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt;&quot; (English: No Time) and was released to radio airplay in Russia on 13 April 2010.29 The song was written by Maxim Fadeev and the lyrics were written by member Olga Seryabkina. &quot;&lt;U+041D&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt; B&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+044F&gt;&quot; was released April 19, 2010 and its English counter-part, &quot;Sexing U&quot;, was later released September 18, 2010.
