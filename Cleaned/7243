''This article refers to the AQA Anthology at G.C.S.E. For the AQA Anthology at A-level see AQA Anthology (A-level).
The AQA Anthology is a collection of poems and short texts which are studied in English schools for GCSE English and English Literature. The anthology is split into several sections covering poems from other cultures, the poetry of Seamus Heaney, Gillian Clarke, Carol Ann Duffy and Simon Armitage, and a bank of pre-1914 poems. There is also a section of prose pieces, which may be studied in schools that have chosen not to study a separate set text.
