In the five seasons from 2003-07, Schoeneweis allowed only one home run to a left-handed batter. Left-handed hitters batted .209, with a .264 slugging percentage and .293 on base percentage, in 227 plate appearances against him from 2005-06,1 and then only .207 with a .241 slugging percentage in 2007.

Early life

At age 19, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer while playing the summer league in Cape Cod. The cancer had already spread to his lymph nodes.6 To get back on the field by January, he requested an aggressive course of chemotherapy consisting of 3 week-long sessions. He said he took &quot;6 months of chemotherapy in 3 months,&quot; and commented that &quot;it puts things in perspective.&quot;7 Schoeneweis overcame the cancer, but lost 20 pounds.8
He returned to the team the following season, but was unable to win a single game in his weakened condition. He seriously injured his pitching elbow, perhaps as a result of his loss in strength, and required Tommy John surgery. He lost his slider, and was only throwing an 80 mph fastball after reconstructive surgery. He spent the following summer rehabilitating and lifting weights before returning to pitch his senior year at Duke University. He enjoyed a sensational season with 10 wins, and graduated with a history degree. Schoeneweis finished as Duke's career leader with 30 wins and 51 games started, and is second on the school's all-time strikeouts list (315).
He played for the USA National Team in  before being drafted by the California Angels in the third round of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft.

Mitchell Report
The Baseball Commissioner's Office met with Schoeneweis to discuss the 2007 ESPN report's allegations. On December 6, 2007, the Commissioner's Office announced that there was insufficient evidence of a violation of the joint program in effect at the time of the conduct in question to warrant discipline of Schoeneweis.21
Schoeneweis said the Mets and other clubs he had played for were aware of his use, which was tied to his treatment of testicular cancer, and the levels were within the limits established by the collective bargaining agreement. &quot;I was just trying to get to normal, not above normal. It's all well-documented,&quot; Schoeneweis said.2223
