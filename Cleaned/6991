Operation Protective Edge (see Name below) is an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) offensive in the Palestinian Gaza Strip, launched on 8 July 2014.1 The operation follows an escalation in fighting between Israel and Hamas.2
Following the kidnapping and murders of three Israeli teenagers in mid-June 2014, the Israel Defense Forces initiated Operation Brother's Keeper in search of the three teenagers.3 As part of the operation, in the following 11 days Israel arrested around 350 Palestinians,456 including nearly all of Hamas' West Bank leaders.7 Five Palestinians were killed during the military operation.891011
On Saturday night July 5, an Israeli strike killed 7 Hamas militants.12 In response, Hamas increased rocket attacks on Israel.13 By 7 July, Hamas had fired 100 rockets from Gaza at Israeli territory and Israel had bombed several sites in Gaza.141516 Early on 8 July Israel bombed 50 targets in the Gaza Strip,17 and Palestinian militants increased the scale of their rocket attacks into Israel. Israel's counter-rocket defense system, the Iron Dome, intercepted about 30 of the rockets. Israel also thwarted a militant infiltration from the sea.18 That same day, Hamas declared that &quot;all Israelis&quot; had become &quot;legitimate targets&quot;1920 and insisted that Israel end all attacks on Gaza, release those re-arrested during the crackdown in the West Bank, lift the blockade on Gaza and return to the cease-fire conditions of 2012 as conditions for a ceasefire.21
On 14 July, Egypt proposed a cease-fire. The Israeli government accepted the proposal, and temporarily stopped hostilities in the morning of 15 July. However, Hamas, which said it had not been consulted on the cease-fire, rejected it in &quot;its current form&quot;.22 On 16 July, Hamas and Islamic Jihad offered Israel a 10-year truce, posing 10 conditions.23 US Secretary of State John Kerry would visit Egypt on July 21 to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza.24
Operation Protective Edge is the deadliest military operation to have taken place in Gaza since the Gaza War in 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09.25 At least 600 Palestinians have been killed.26 The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimated using preliminary information that as of 20 July nearly 72% of those killed were civilians, of whom 44% were women or children. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, over 3,008 Palestinians have been injured.27 As of 14 July, the Israel Defense Forces estimated that about 90 of the dead were Hamas militants, and says Hamas was using the Gazan population as &quot;human shields&quot;;28 an allegation denied by Hamas.29 The Israeli Defense Forces reported that as of 13 July, more than 1,300 Israeli attacks have occurred, while more than 800 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel.30
Human rights groups have argued that Palestinian rocket attacks and Israeli targeted destruction of the homes of Hamas and other militia members violate international humanitarian law and might constitute war crimes.313233
Name
Literal translation of the operation's name (, Mivtza' Tzuk Eitan) is &quot;Operation Steadfast Cliff&quot; or &quot;Firm Cliff&quot;; more loosely translated, &quot;Operation Solid Rock&quot; of &quot;Operation Mighty Cliff&quot;;34 or &quot;Resolute Cliff&quot; in the form of the IDF's official Arabic translation.35 According to the Turkish Anadolu Agency, an Israeli military spokesman for Arab Media, Avichay Adraee, explained that the change of the operation's name in English was done to more heavily convey the idea that the operation was defensive in nature.36
Background
On 23 April 2014, Hamas agreed to a reconciliation deal with the other main Palestinian faction, Fatah3738 following seven years of division. The Palestinian unity government was sworn in by 2 June 20143940 and Israel announced it would not negotiate any peace deal with the new government and would push punitive measures.41 Declaring this unity will &quot;strengthen terrorism&quot; a day before the agreement, Benjamin Netanyahu said: &quot;The international community must not embrace it.&quot;42 The agreement was likely to have a significant impact on the current round of peace talks between Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority and Israel, and shortly after the announcement of the agreement, Israel launched an airstrike in the northern Gaza Strip that injured four people, according to medical officials.4344 Netanyahu had warned before the deal it would be incompatible with Israeli&lt;U+2013&gt;Palestinian peace and that Abbas has to choose between peace with Hamas and peace with Israel. When a reconciliation deal was signed opening the way to the appointment of the new government, Netanyahu chaired a security cabinet in which they voted to authorise Netanyahu to impose unspecified sanctions against the Palestinian Authority.45 According to The Forward, Brigadier General Moti Almoz, the chief spokesman of the Israeli military, said: &quot;We have been instructed by the political echelon to hit Hamas hard.&quot;46
The operation follows a chain of events that began with the abduction of three Israeli teenagers Naftali Fraenkel (16), Gilad Shaer (16) and Eyal Yifrah (19) in the West Bank in June 2014, for which Israel blamed Hamas. The IDF stated that the two men Israel suspects of having kidnapped the teenagers were known members of Hamas,4748 No evidence of Hamas involvement has been offered by the Israeli authorities49 and high-ranking members of Hamas have denied that the group had any involvement or foreknowledge of the incident;50 The alleged murderers come from the Qawasameh clan which is notorious for acting against Hamas's policies and its attempts to reach an entente with Israel.51 however, Hamas political chief Khaled Meshal said that he can neither confirm nor deny the kidnapping of the three Israelis, and congratulated the abductors.52 Israeli forces killed ten Palestinians in clashes, including two under 1853 and arrested several hundred more in the West Bank in the subsequent widespread search for the missing teenagers and suppression of Hamas cells and infrastructure dubbed Operation Brother's Keeper.5455 During the search for the three missing Israeli teenagers, the IDF arrested many of the people who had been released during the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. On 30 June, search teams found the bodies of the three missing teenagers in a field north-west of Hebron.5657 They had apparently been killed shortly after their abduction.58
Hours after the funeral of the three murdered Israelis, a 16-year-old Palestinian teenager named Mohammed Abu Khdeir of Beit Hanina was kidnapped and burned alive in a retaliatory attack by Jewish extremists.59 Six Jewish suspects in the murder have been arrested by the Israeli police.6061 The discovery of Khdeir's body led to protests and rioting in East Jerusalem which spread to Arab villages across the country,62 and an official apology and condolence from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.63 Hamas, which had been credited by Israel as reining in militant rocket fire from the Gaza Strip since a ceasefire agreement in November 2012, at the conclusion of Operation Pillar of Defense, took direct responsibility for a barrage of rockets fired into Israel on 7 July 201464 and insisted on the release of those rearrested as a condition of a ceasefire.6566 At the same time, exchanges of Gaza-based rocket fire into Israel and Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip flared.
Israel argues that this attack on the Gaza Strip is also in reaction to hundreds of rockets and mortar shell launched from Gaza by Hamas.67 from Gaza Strip into Israel during a period of 19 months in 2012-14. Israel claims that the ceasefire agreement achieved at the end of Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012 with Hamas, did not prevent firing into Israel during that period.68 The Jerusalem Fund, contrariwise, has listed over 220 Israeli violations of the November 2012 truce from its inception down to 6 July 2014.69 Hamas state that they are engaged in legitimate resistance to Israeli occupation and that attacks its military wing engaged in were a response to the IDF's violent operations across the West Bank following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli youths. According to Avi Shlaim, while the &quot;chain of action and reaction is endless&quot;, the underlying cause for the violence is Israeli occupation and colonialism in the Palestinian Territories.70
Violations of the truce
In the first three months after the Operation Pillar of Defense, according to Ben White, two mortar shells struck Israeli territory, while 4 Gazans were shot dead and 91 wounded by Israeli forces, which fired inside Gazan territory on 63 occasions, made 13 incursions into the Strip, and attacked the Gazan fishing fleet 30 times.71 According to the Middle East Monitor, in the year following the truce, Israel violated the cease-fire nearly 120 times.72 Rockets and Mortars fired into Israel according to Shin Bet, Israel's security service. The Shin Bet statistics do differentiate between rocket fire from Gaza into Israel and Gazan fire at Israeli incursions into the Gaza Strip.73

 Shortly after midnight, the IDF said that the death count for militants since entering Gaza has risen above 40 and that it had arrested an additional 21 militants.242
In the late morning, nine Hamas militants entered Israel via a tunnel, wearing IDF uniforms and carrying weapons, handcuffs, syringes, and sedatives. They were met by the IDF; one militant and two IDF soldiers were killed, and the remaining militants escaped through the tunnel; several were later killed in Gaza by an Israeli airstrike.243
In the afternoon, a rocket shot from Gaza at Israel landed on a tent of a Bedouin family, killing the father, critically injuring a 4-month-old, and injuring two others.244 By that night the IDF had uncovered 34 tunnels within Gaza, and was dismantling them.245 On 19 July, over 94 rockets were fired from Gaza at Israel.246 That day the IDF hit 140 sites in Gaza, bringing the total to 260 since the ground operation started,247 causing 49 Palestinian deaths on that day and 348 since the operation started.248
20 July
  In the morning the IDF announced that two further IDF soldiers had been killed. On 19 July, a militant entered Israel via a tunnel and shot an Israeli soldier dead, before being killed by other IDF personnel; the other soldier was killed by an anti-tank missile.249 Hamas announced that they had killed five soldiers in the attack.250
At approximately 1 A.M., an Israeli armored personnel carrier in Shuja'iyya was hit by an anti-tank missile, killing all 7 IDF soldiers inside.251 In the ensuing conflict in Shuja'iyya, 72252 Palestinians died in what local medical authorities,253 along with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, called a massacre. (See Shuja'iyya Incident (2014)). The IDF has stated that Shuja'iyya has been the site of 8% of the rocket launches since July 8, and that residents had been warned to leave two days earlier.254
Hamas requested via the Red Crescent a humanitarian ceasefire for the Shuja'iyya neighborhood to allow the evacuation of wounded from the area. The IDF agreed, and the ceasefire begun at 13:30; however, only an hour into the truce, IDF troops came under fire and responded.255 Despite the issues during the ceasefire, Israel agreed to extend it by one hour.256
In total, the IDF has stated that 13 IDF soldiers were killed in Gaza over 24 hours,257 and more than 60 Palestinian militants were killed during the night.258 During the overnight fighting, the IDF uncovered an additional 10 tunnel systems.259
The military wing of Hamas claimed that they had killed at least 32 Israeli soldiers since 19 July. Hamas military sources said scores of Israeli soldiers injured in the clashes with Palestinian fighters had been taken to hospitals, including the commander of the Golani Brigade, Israeli Druze Colonel Ghassan Alian.260 They also claimed they captured an Israeli soldier named Shaul Aron.261262 However, Ron Prosor, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, denied the report.263
21 July
Since the beginning of the operation, IDF has struck some 2,800 targets in Gaza,264 while 1,497 rockets have been fired from Gaza at Israel.265
During the night, two cells of militants attempted to infiltrate Israel using tunnels. While the Israeli Air Force directly hit the first cell, ground troops engaged the second;266 at least 10 militants were killed during the two incidents.267 During one attack, 10 Palestinians exited the tunnel wearing full IDF uniforms.268 Four IDF soldiers were killed in the attack when an anti-tank missile hit their Jeep.269 In total, 7 IDF soldiers were killed on 21 July.270
Reports from Gaza in the afternoon stated that the IDF shelled a hospital, killing five and injuring many others.271 The IDF commented on the situation stating that their target was anti-tank missiles which was stored in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.272
IDF set up a field hospital for injured Palestinians from Gaza, which they located at the Erez Border Crossing.273274
A 21 July news report from CNN stated that over 83,000 Palestinians have sought refuge in U.N. facilities with more than 2,000 rockets fired at Israel since the start of the Operation, the latter information from the IDF. That day as well, U.S. President Barack Obama called for a return to the Gaza-Israel cease-fire agreement while also expressing regret at the civilian casualties both in Israel and in Palestine.275
Week 3
22 July
Shortly after midnight, the United Arab Emirates announced they would be giving $41m in aid to those in Gaza,276 and the U.S. government announced $47m in aid.277
At 05:00 the IDF announced that two additional IDF soldiers had been killed, bringing the total to 27.278
During the morning the IDF announced that one soldier's remains from the weekend's APC attack had not yet been recovered, that soldier was later identified as Oron Shaul.279 Two days prior Hamas had announced they captured a soldier named Shaul Aron.280 The IDF however has stated that their official position is that the soldier is presumed to have been killed.281
In the late morning Al Jazeera stated their office was currently under attack by the IDF.282
Impact
Impact on residents
hospitals in Gaza were ill-equipped and facing severe shortage of various categories of medicine, medical supplies, and fuel.283 Egypt temporarily reopened the Rafah crossing with Gaza to allow medical supplies to enter, and injured Palestinians to receive treatment in Egypt.284 Additionally, due to the operation prices of food, including fish and produce, rose dramatically.285 As stated before, a 21 July news report stated that over 83,000 Palestinians had taken shelter in U.N. facilities.286
 At the onset of the operation, the Israeli government canceled all programs within 40 km (24 miles) of Gaza, and requested all people stay at home or near shelter. All summer camps were closed and universities canceled their final exams.287 Additionally, all gatherings of 300 or more were banned.288 Due to the trajectory of rocket fire from Gaza, many flights in and out of Ben-Gurion Airport were delayed or rerouted.289
Casualties and losses
 Thus far 600 Palestinians have been killed.290 According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 72% of those killed were civilians (as of its report on 20 July, at which time it said 375 civilians were killed. 83 of those killed were children and 36 women). Many fatalities which could not be verified were not included in the OCHA report. Over 3,008 have been wounded  according to Gazan medical officials. Over 100,000 people have been displaced, including 84,000 who have taken refugee in UNRWA schools. 85 schools and 18 medical facilities were damaged.291 In addition, over 3,000 homes have been partially destroyed by the air strikes.292
According to the Israeli Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Center, as of 20 July 2014, 130 terrorist operatives, 138 civilians, and 134 unidentified Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.293
Many of those killed have been civilians, prompting concern from many humanitarian organisations. 9 people killed while watching the World Cup in a cafe,294 and 8 members of a family which Israel says were inadvertently killed.295 In response, Israel stated that many civilian casualties were the result of Hamas using the Gazan population as 'human shields' at rocket launch targets,296 an allegation denied by Hamas.297 Seven members of a family were killed when they climbed on the roof of their house to act as a human shield, however, their home was still struck despite their action.298 Israel has condemned Hamas for the group's encouragement of Palestinians to stay in their homes even if they receive warnings of immanent airstrikes, with Hamas arguing back that people would be as much or more unsafe in the rest of Gaza.299
Human rights groups such as B'Tselem have argued that targeting the homes of militia members, with bombings taking place despite no evidence given of weapons or other such material in those places, violates international humanitarian law and might constitute war crimes.300301
Rocket and missile attacks from Gaza have caused damage to Israeli civilian infrastructure, including factories, gas stations, and homes.302 There has been one Israeli civilian death, occurring at the Erez border crossing with Gaza: a Chabad rabbi who was delivering food and drinks on the frontline303 and was hit by mortar fire.304 According to Magen David Adom there have been injuries to 123 people: 1 seriously, 21 moderately to lightly and 101 from shock.305 An elderly woman in Wadi Nisnas collapsed and died of heart failure306 during an air-raid siren.307 The second Israeli civilian killed was a 32 year old Bedouin Ouda Lafi al-Waj, who was hit by a rocket in the Negev Desert.308 As stated before, the IDF has stated as of 21 July that over 2,000 rockets have been fired at Israel since the start of the operation.309
The international organization Human Rights Watch described the deliberate targeting of Israeli civilians by Hamas fire as war crimes in a 9 July statement.310
Cost
Israel's Minister of Finance estimated that the operation would cost NIS 8.5 billion (approximately 2.5 billion USD), which is similar to Operation Cast Lead in 2009 and higher than Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012. The forecast included military and non-military costs, including military expenditure and property damage. The calculation indicates that if the operation lasts 20 days, the loss in GDP will be 0.4%.311
Reactions
Media coverage
Portrayals of the conflict have varied in different media outlets. In the English-speaking world, U.S. news sources were often more sympathetic to Israel,312 though commentators on both sides have stated that U.S. coverage of the conflict has failed to adequately provide context and background for the public to understand the issues involved. Commentators on both sides have also claimed that the media is biased either for or against Israel.313 British sources were more often critical of Israel.314 As the conflict progressed and Palestinian deaths increased, media became somewhat more critical of Israel.315
ABC News received criticism when Diane Sawyer misidentified photos of rubble in Gaza as being in Israel. The progressive316 media criticism organization FAIR said that the mistake reflected a worldview in American media and a &quot;false balance&quot; between the two sides of the conflict, when in fact many more Palestinians have suffered than Israelis.317 Sawyer later apologized on-air for the error.318
NBC News was criticized for ordering its correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin out of Gaza after witnessing the killing of four Palestinian children.319 He was subsequently reinstated.
Investigative reporter Judith Miller criticized US media, and her former employer The New York Times in particular, for being unsympathetic to Israel and downplaying the context of the kidnapping and murder of Israeli teenagers.320
British MP George Galloway said: &quot;The 300 Palestinians are completely ignored by the same newspapers, by the same television stations and by the same political leaders who are threatening sanctions and war against Russia. ... Why the double standard? Why is the blood in Ukraine so much more noteworthy than the blood in Gaza?&quot;321
Within Israel, the newspaper Haaretz issued an editorial stating that the &quot;soft Gaza sand... could turn into quicksand&quot; for the Israeli military and warning about the &quot;wholesale killing&quot; of Palestinian civilians. The article declared, &quot;There can be no victory here.&quot;322 The campaign in the Palestinian territories has received much coverage in the nation.
Criticism of the BBC's coverage
In The Guardian, Owen Jones called the BBC's headline &quot;Israel under renewed Hamas attack&quot;, &quot;perverse as Mike Tyson punching a toddler, followed by a headline claiming that the child spat at him&quot;, and that &quot;the macabre truth is that Israeli life is deemed by the Western media to be worth more than a Palestinian life&quot;.323
In London, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, hundreds protested outside the BBC's offices accusing the corporation of &quot;pro-Israeli bias&quot; in its coverage of the ongoing conflict. It claimed that news coverage was &quot;entirely devoid of context or background&quot;. An open letter to BBC director signed by 45,000 people including Noam Chomsky, John Pilger, Ken Loach, Brian Eno and Jeremy Hardy said it would &quot;like to remind the BBC that Gaza is under Israeli occupation and siege [and] that Israel is bombing a refugee population&quot;. The BBC has defended its coverage.324325
Building on research by the Glasgow University Media Group that examined the media coverage of recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Gaza, Greg Philo, research director of the university's media unit, described how senior BBC journalists have spoken to him about being unable to get the Palestinian viewpoint across.326
Social media
In the 8 days leading up to Operation Protective Edge, the social media site Twitter hashtag #GazaUnderAttack was used over 375,000 times. Often the hashtag was used on tweets using photos that claimed to show how the people are suffering due to Israeli attacks. A BBC study showed that in some cases these photos were from previous Israeli attacks, or from wars in Syria and Iraq.327328
A false report circulated on social media and via SMS that a rocket from Gaza had hit a petrochemical plant in Haifa. These reports cited Haaretz as their source but turned out to be false. Haaretz denies having issued such warnings.329
A photograph published by Danish journalist Allan S&lt;U+00F8&gt;rensen on Twitter caused uproar online, gathering more than 8,500 retweets. It allegedly shows Israelis in Sderot gathered on top of a hill to celebrate and cheer as they watched Israeli airstrikes on Gaza. People reportedly brought chairs, sofas, popcorn, and hookahs with them.330 The scene was described as &quot;something resembling a party&quot;.331 Similarly, according to The Jerusalem Post, Palestinians in Hebron cheered as Gazan rockets were fired at Tel Aviv. People reportedly stood at rooftops chanting &quot;Allah Akbar&quot; at the sight.332

More than 100 Gazans killed in Israeli assault in less than 48 hours 19 July 2014: 'Israel launched its assault on Gaza&lt;U+2014&gt;which it has named Operation Protective Edge&lt;U+2014&gt;12 days ago in what it said was an attempt to curb rocket fire from the Gaza Strip, which had increased since it began an assault on the West Bank in June that left 10 dead, 130 injured, and more than 600 Hamas-affiliated individuals in prison. That campaign was launched by Israel after the disappearance of three Israeli youth, for which it blamed Hamas but presented no evidence. Hamas, meanwhile, denied the charges, and many accused Israel of blaming the group in order to have an excuse to &quot;crush&quot; the group, as senior Israel officials later demanded. Although Hamas had widely observed a ceasefire with Israel put in place in 2012, as Israel massively targeted the group across the West Bank other groups began firing rockets, with Israel bombing the Strip in near nightly raids as a result, eventually escalating into the current operation 12 days ago.'↩
