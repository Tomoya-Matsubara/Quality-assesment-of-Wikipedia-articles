Arizona
1975: Two men from Phoenix, Arizona are granted a marriage license by a county clerk on January 7. The Arizona Supreme Court, citing the Bible, voided and revoked the marriage licence. The state legislature passed a bill specifically defining marriage as being between a man and a woman.1
September 2006: The Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a proposition that would amend the state constitution defining marriage would be allowed on the ballot.2
November 2006: Even well past midnight on election night, the amendment was flipping between a narrow margin for or against. The final outcome of 51% (including absentee ballots) opposing the marriage amendment made Arizona the first state where voters rebuffed a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman.345 Conservative groups have said, considering the relatively small margin in which it failed, the result was more likely due to confusing ballot language than an indication of changing public opinion.6 An already-existing statutory ban was unaffected and remained current state law.7
An amendment proposal was included in the 2008 general elections which passed, thus amending Arizona's Constitution to recognize marriage as between a man and woman only.

California
On May 15, 2008, the Supreme Court of California overturned the ban on same-sex marriage, making California the second state, behind Massachusetts, to allow full marriage rights for same-sex partners. Citing a 1948 California Supreme Court decision that reversed interracial marriages ban, the Republican-dominated California Supreme Court, (in a 4-3 ruling, penned by Chief Justice Ronald George) struck down California's 1977 one-man, one-woman marriage law and a similar voter-approved 2000 law (passed with 61%). Marriage licenses for same-sex couples will be available starting June 17, 2008. The 2006 census figures indicate that California has an estimated 108,734 same-sex households.8
The California Office of Vital Records announced on May 28, 2008 that it planned to start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 17, 2008.1 The Office of Vital Records chose the date of June 17 to be prepared if the May 15, 2008 decision of the Supreme Court of California is not stayed.
In a one-page Resolution, the California Supreme Court on June 4, 2008 forthwith denied all petitions for rehearing and to reconsider the May 15 ruling, as it removed the final obstacle to same-sex marriages starting on June 17. It further rejected moves to delay enforcement of the decision until after the November election, when voters will decide whether to reinstate a ban on same-sex nuptials. Chief Justice Ronald George and Justices Joyce Kennard, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Carlos Moreno, voted for the resolution, while dissenting or voting to reconsider the judgment, were Justices Marvin Baxter, Ming Chin and Carol Corrigan.9The judgment stated: &lt;U+201C&gt;The decision filed on May 15, 2008, will become final on June 16, 2008, at 5 p.m.&lt;U+201D&gt; San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that marriages would be held &lt;U+201C&gt;5:01&lt;U+201D&gt; on June 16.1011 Moreover, a field poll in late May, reported that &quot;51% of registered voters in the state favored the right of same-sex couples to marry, with 42 percent opposed.&quot;.12
Same-sex marriage opponents gathered sufficient signatures to place a constitutional amendment on the November 2008 ballot to define marriage as between a man and woman, Proposition 8. Although final certified results are pending, the proposition passed, leaving the status of approximately 18,000 same-sex marriages uncertain.13

Colorado
1975: Clela Rorex, county clerk of Boulder County, Colorado, allowed six same-sex couples to wed after receiving an advisory opinion from the district attorney's office indicating that the state's laws did not explicitly prohibit it.14 A law was quickly pushed through to prohibit gay marriages.
On November 7, 2006, Colorado voters approved a constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between a man and a woman only and defeated a referendum to allow same-sex couples to register domestic partnerships.

(a) It is licensed, solemnized, and registered as provided in this part 1; and
(b) It is only between one man and one woman.
''(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 14-2-112, any marriage contracted within or outside this state that does not satisfy paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of this section shall not be recognized as valid in this state. ''
No marriage license or recognition, no other relationship or its recognition from other jurisdictions for same-sex couples.
Connecticut
On October 10, 2008, the Connecticut Supreme Court issued a 4-3 ruling that denial of same-sex marriage is a violation of the Connecticut state constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection. This makes Connecticut currently the second state in which same-sex marriage is legal, following Massachusetts. The ruling, which cannot be appealed to a federal court because it deals only with state constitutional issues, took effect on October 28. While the state could amend the state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage, sentiment in both the state Republican and Democratic party is that this is unlikely.15
Texts:
Connecticut Substitute Senate Bill 963 &lt;U+00A7&gt;14 (Effective October 1, 2005)
Parties to a civil union shall have all the same benefits, protections and responsibilities under law, whether derived from the general statutes, administrative regulations or court rules, policy, common law or any other source of civil law, as are granted to spouses in a marriage, which is defined as the union of one man and one woman.
No marriage license or recognition from other jurisdictions for same-sex couples.

(d) A marriage obtained or recognized outside the state between persons prohibited by subsection (a) of this section shall not constitute a legal or valid marriage within the state.
No marriage license or recognition, no other relationship or its recognition from other jurisdictions for same-sex couples.
District of Columbia
Unresolved. The debate over same-sex marriage in Washington, D.C. is complicated by the fact that the United States Congress has ultimate authority over laws passed by the Council of the District of Columbia. Despite support from D.C. residents and elected officials in favor of same-sex marriage, the federal Defense of Marriage Act restricts the District from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Omnibus Domestic Partnership Equality Amendment Act of 2008, passed unanimously by the D.C. Council, provides the highest degree of legal protections akin to marriage for same-sex couples as possible without running afoul of federal law.16
No marriage license, recognition, or explicit prohibition from other jurisdictions for same-sex couples.

Florida
November 4, 2008: Florida voters approve a ballot measure that amends the state constitution to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples and ban civil unions.

Minnesota
1971: The Minnesota Supreme Court rules against the contention of plaintiffs Jack Baker and Mike McConnell that absence of a specific prohibition on same-sex marriage signified a legislative intent to recognize them. The court found that &quot;The institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book of Genesis&quot;.22 This decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court (see Baker v. Nelson), but was dismissed for failure to present a federal question. Such a dismissal constitutes a holding that the claimed Federal right--a Constitutional mandate to treat same-sex and opposite-sex couples identically--does not exist.

Oklahoma
May 13, 2004: A lesbian couple from Tulsa obtained a marriage application in the Cherokee tribal headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The Cherokee Nation issues marriage applications, rather than licenses. Couples obtaining a license have it signed by the individual performing the ceremony before returning to tribal court to have the application certified. Cherokee Principal Chief Chad &quot;Corntassel&quot; Smith stated that he believes that same-sex marriages are not allowed under Cherokee law, and the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council unanimously approved language that defined a union as between one man and one woman.
July 2005: The tribe's Judicial Appeals Tribunal upheld the couple's right to marry, confirming that if they should refile for certification, it would be granted.30 Although Oklahoma does not recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, Oklahoma does recognize all Cherokee marriages. It is unclear how Oklahoma would react if the Cherokee tribal courts decide that this marriage is valid.
