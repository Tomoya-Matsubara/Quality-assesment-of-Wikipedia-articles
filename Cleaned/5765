The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; are a small genus Pudu, of two species of deer endemic to South America—the world's smallest and second smallest deer.1 The etymology of the name is uncertain, but many forms are considered correct.2 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s (which translates to &quot;mapuche&quot; or &quot;the people of southern Chile&quot;)3 are divided into two groups: the Northern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; (Pudu mephistophiles) is found in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile;4 the Southern or Chilean Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; (Pudu puda) is found in southern Chile and southwestern Argentina.5 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s range in size from  tall and up to  long.6 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are endangered as of 2009, mainly because of over-hunting and habitat loss.7
Taxonomy
The genus Pudu was first erected by English naturalist John Edward Gray in 1850. Pudua was a Latinized version of the name proposed by Alfred Henry Garrod in 1877 but ruled invalid. They are classified in the New World deer subfamily Capreolinae within the deer family Cervidae. The term &quot;pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;&quot; itself is derived from the Mapuche people of the Chilean region and translates to 'the people of southern Chile'.8 Because they live on the slopes of the Andes Mountain Range, they are also known as the &quot;Chilean mountain goat&quot;.9
Two species of Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; are recognised-the southern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; and the northern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;. The southern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; (Pudu puda) stands  tall and weighs .10 The antlers of the southern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; grow to be  long and tend to curve back, somewhat like a mountain goat. Their coat is a dark chestnut-brown, and tends to tuft in the front, covering the antlers. The northern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; (Pudu mephistophiles)11 is close to half the height of the southern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; and weighs .12 The antlers of the northern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; grow to about  long, also curving backward. Their coat tends to be lighter, but their faces are darker compared to the coat. Overall, the northern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; is the smaller of the two deer and is lighter in color.13
Description
The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; is the world's smallest deer.14 It is a small, short-legged animal, standing  high at the shoulder and up to  in length. Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s normally weigh up to ,15 but the highest recorded weight of a pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; is .16 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s have small, black eyes, 17 black noses, and rounded ears with lengths of . Sexual dimorphism in the species includes an absence of antlers in females. Males have short, spiked antlers that are not forked, as seen in most species of deer. The antlers, which are shed annually,18 can extend from  in length and protrude from between the ears.19 Also on the head are large preorbital glands. Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s have small hooves, dewclaws, and a short tail about  in length when measured without hair. Coat coloration varies with season, gender, and individual genes. The fur is long and stiff, typically pressed close to the body, with a reddish brown to dark brown hue.20 The neck and shoulders of an aged pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; turn a dark gray-brown in the winter.21
Habitat and distribution
The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; inhabits temperate rainforests in South America, where the dense underbrush and bamboo thickets offer protection from predators.22. Southern Chile, southwest Argentina, Chiloe island, and northwest South America are home to the deer, from coastal elevation to  above sea level.2324
The climate of the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;'s habitat is composed of two main seasons: a damp, moderate winter and an arid summer. Annual precipitation in these areas of Argentina and Chile ranges from .25
Behavior
Social
The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; is a solitary animal whose behavior in the wild is largely unknown because of its secretive nature.26 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are nocturnal and diurnal, but are mostly active in the morning, late afternoon, and evening. Their home range generally extends about , much of which consists of crisscrossing pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;-trodden paths. Each pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; has its own home range, or territory.27 A single animal's territory is marked with sizable dung piles found on paths and near eating and resting areas. Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; deer.28 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; do not interact socially, other than to mate.29 An easily frightened animal, the deer barks when in fear.3031 Its fur bristles and the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; shivers when angered.32
Predators of the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; include the Horned owl, Andean fox, Magellan fox, cougar, and other small cats. The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; is a wary animal that moves slowly and stops often, smelling the air for scents of predators. Being a proficient climber, jumper, and sprinter, the deer flees in a zigzag path when being pursued.33 The longevity of the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; ranges from 8 to 10 years in the wild.34 The longest recorded life span is 15 years and 9 months. However, such longevity is rare and most pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s die at a much younger age. These deer die from a wide range of causes. Maternal neglect as newborns as well as a wide range of diseases can decrease the population.35 If alarmed to a high degree, pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s die from fear-induced cardiac complications.36
Diet
The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; is herbivorous,37 consuming vines, leaves from low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit.383940 They can survive without drinking water for long periods due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diet.41
Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s have various methods of obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and cautious nature create obstacles in attaining food.42 They stop often while searching for food to stand on their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents.4344 Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so that the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage.45 They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.46
Reproduction
Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are solitary and only come together for rut. Mating season is in the Southern Hemisphere autumn, from April to May.47 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; DNA is arranged into 70 chromosomes.48 To mate, the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; male rests his chin on the female's back, then sniffs her rear before mounting her from behind, holding her with his forelegs.49 The gestation period ranges from 202 to 223 days (around 7 months) with the average being 210 days.50 A single offspring or sometimes twins are born in austral spring, from November to January.5152 Newborns weigh  with the average birth weight being .5354 Newborns less than  or more than  die. Females and males weigh the same at birth.55 Fawns have reddish brown fur and Southern pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; fawns have white spots running the length of their back.56 Young are weaned after 2 months. Females mature sexually in 6 months while males mature in 8&lt;U+2013&gt;12 months.57 Fawns are fully grown in 3 months but may stay with their mothers for 8 to 12 months.58
Endangerment and conservation
Status and conservation
Both species of pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; are classified as Vulnerable by Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.596061 Many pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are in zoo captivity and are studied. The Southern species is more easily maintained in captivity than the Northern, though small Northern populations can be found in some zoos.62 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are difficult to transport because they are easily overheated and stressed.63 Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are protected in various national parks. Parks require resources in order to enforce protection of the deer.64
Pudu in captivity at Bristol Zoo
There are efforts to preserve the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; species before they become extinct. An international captive breeding program for the Southern Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; led by Concepcion University in Chile has been started.6566 Some deer have been bred in captivity and re-introduced into Nahuel Huapi National Park in Argentina.67 Re-introduction efforts include the use of radio collars for tracking.68 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species has banned the international trading of pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s.69 The Wildlife Conservation Society protects their natural habitat and works to recreate it for pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s in captivity.70 Despite efforts made by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the size of the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; population remains unknown.71 Threats to the pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; remain despite various conservation efforts.72
Threats
The pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;'s endangerment is caused by the destruction of their rainforest habitat. The land is cleared for human development, cattle ranching, agriculture, logging, and exotic tree plantations.737475 Habitat fragmentation and road accidents cause pud&lt;U+00FA&gt; deaths. They are taken from the wild as pets, as well exported illegally.7677 They are overhunted and killed for food by specially trained hunting dogs.787980 With the introduction of exotic species of European red deer, pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s must compete for food. Domestic dogs prey upon the deer and spread parasites through contact. Pud&lt;U+00FA&gt;s are very susceptible to diseases like bladder worms, lungworms, roundworms, and heartworms.8182
