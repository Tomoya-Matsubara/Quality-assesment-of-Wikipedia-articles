Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h (; , &quot;Glory of God&quot;; 12 November 1817Â &lt;U+2013&gt; 29 May 1892), born  (), was the founder of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith. He claimed to be the prophetic fulfilment of B&lt;U+00E1&gt;bism, a 19th-century outgrowth of Sh&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2018&gt;ism, but in a broader sense claimed to be a messenger from God referring to the fulfilment of the eschatological expectations of Islam, Christianity, and other major religions.1
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h taught that humanity is one single race and that the age has come for its unification in a global society. His claim to divine revelation resulted in persecution and imprisonment by the Persian and Ottoman authorities, and his eventual 24-year confinement in the prison city of `Akka, Palestine (present day Israel), where he died. He authored many religious works, most notably the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas and the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-&lt;U+00CD&gt;q&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.
There are two known photographs of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. Outside of pilgrimage, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s prefer not to view his photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes.
Early and family life
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was born on 12 November 1817, in Tehran, the capital of Persia, present-day Iran. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; authors state that his ancestry can be traced back to Abraham through Abraham's wife Keturah,2 to Zoroaster and to Yazdigird III, the last king of the Sassanid Empire,3 and also to Jesse.45 His mother was Khad&lt;U+00ED&gt;jih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num and his father was M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Buzurg. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's father, M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Buzurg, served as vizier to Im&lt;U+00E1&gt;m-Virdi M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt;, the twelfth son of Fat&lt;U+2032&gt;h Ali Shah Qajar. M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Buzurg was later appointed governor of Burujird and Lorestan,6 a position that he was stripped of during a government purge when Muhammad Shah came to power. After the death of his father, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was asked to take a government post by the new vizier Haji Mirza Aqasi, but declined.7
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was married three times. He married his first wife &lt;U+00C1&gt;s&lt;U+00ED&gt;yih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num, the daughter of a nobleman, in Tehran in 1835, when he was 18 and she was 15.8 She was given the title of The Most Exalted Leaf and Navv&lt;U+00E1&gt;b.9 His second marriage was to his widowed cousin F&lt;U+00E1&gt;timih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num, in Tehran in 1849 when she was 21 and he was 32.10 She was known as Mahd-i-`Uly&lt;U+00E1&gt;. His third marriage to Gawhar Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num occurred in Baghdad sometime before 1863.11
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h declared &lt;U+00C1&gt;s&lt;U+00ED&gt;yih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num his &quot;perpetual consort in all the worlds of God&quot;, and her son `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; as his vicar.12 He had 14 children, four daughters and ten sons, five of whom he outlived.13 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s regard &lt;U+00C1&gt;s&lt;U+00ED&gt;yih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num and her children M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Mihd&lt;U+00ED&gt;, Bah&lt;U+00ED&gt;yyih Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;num and `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;' to be the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; holy family.14
B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; movement
In 1844, a 25 year-old man from Shiraz, , who took the title of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b, claimed to be the promised Mahdi of Islam.15 The movement quickly spread across the Persian Empire and received widespread opposition from the Islamic clergy.16 The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b himself was executed in 1850 by a firing squad in the public square of Tabriz at the age of 30 and the community was almost entirely exterminated in 1852&lt;U+2013&gt;3.17
While the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation.18 In most of his prominent writings, the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as &quot;Him whom God shall make manifest&quot;. According to the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b, this personage, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would establish the kingdom of God on the Earth;1920 several of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's writings state the coming of Him Whom God shall make manifest would be imminent.21 In the books written by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b he constantly entreats his believers to follow Him whom God shall make manifest when he arrives.22 The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b also eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until Him whom God shall make manifest would appear.23
Acceptance of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h first heard of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b when he was 27, and received a visitor sent by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b, Mull&lt;U+00E1&gt; Husayn, telling him of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b and his claims. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h accepted the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's claims, becoming a B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; and helping to spread the new movement, especially in his native province of N&lt;U+00FA&gt;r, where he became recognized as one of its most influential believers.2425 His notability as a local gave him many openings, and his trips to teach the religion were met with success, even among some of the religious class. He also helped to protect fellow believers, such as T&lt;U+00E1&gt;hirih, for which he was temporarily imprisoned in Tehran and punished with bastinado or foot whipping.26 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, in the summer of 1848, also attended the conference of Badasht in the province of Khorasan, where 81 prominent B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s met for 22 days; at that conference where there was a discussion between those B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who wanted to maintain Islamic law and those who believed that the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's message began a new dispensation, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h took the pro-change side, which eventually won out. It is at this conference that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h took on the name Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;.27
When violence started between the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s and the Qajar government in the later part of 1848, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h tried to reach the besieged B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s at the Shaykh Tabarsi in Mazandaran, but was arrested and imprisoned before he could get there.28 The following years until 1850 saw the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s being massacred in various provinces after the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b made his claim of being Manifestation of God more public.29
S&lt;U+00ED&gt;y&lt;U+00E1&gt;h-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;l
After the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b was executed in 1850, a group of Tehran B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, headed by a B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; known as Azim, who was previously a Shaykhi cleric, plotted an assassination plan against the Shah Nasser-al-Din Shah, in retaliation for the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's execution.30 The policy was opposed by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, and he condemned the plan, however, any moderating influence that he may have had was diminished since in June 1851 he went into exile to Baghdad at the chief minister's request, only returning after Amir Kabir's fall from power.3132 On 15 August 1852, the radical group of B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s attempted to cary out the assassination of the Shah and failed.33 The group of B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s linked with the plan, were rounded up and killed, and, notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community was blamed, precipitating violent riots against the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community by the government.34 During this time many B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s were killed, and many of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who were not killed, including Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, were imprisoned in the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;y&lt;U+00E1&gt;h-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;l (black pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran.35
According to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, it was during his imprisonment in the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;y&lt;U+00E1&gt;h-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;l that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a maiden from God, through whom he received his mission as a messenger of God and as the one whose coming the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b had prophesied.3637 After four months in the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;y&lt;U+00E1&gt;h-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;l, owing to the insistent demands of the ambassador of Russia, and after the person who tried to kill the Shah confessed and exonerated the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; leaders, the authorities released him from prison, but the government exiled him from Iran. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, instead of accepting the offer of refuge from Russia, chose to go to Iraq in the Ottoman Empire; in 1853 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and his family travelled from Persia arriving in Baghdad on 8 April 1853.383940
Baghdad
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's passport, dated January 1853
The B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b eliminated the institution of successorship or vicegerency to his movement, and had stated that no other person's writings would be binding after his death until Him Whom God shall make manifest would appear.41 He did, however, appoint M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt; (later known as Subh-i-Azal) as a nominal leader after himself. M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt; had gone into hiding after the assassination attempt on the Shah, and after Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's exile to Baghdad, he chose to join his brother there.42 At the same time, an increasing number of B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s considered Baghdad the new center for leadership of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; religion, and a flow of pilgrims started coming there from Persia.
M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; on several occasions he went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b.434445 M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt; gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who started to give their alliance to other claimants.46 During the time that M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt; remained in hiding, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h performed much of the daily administration of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; affairs.47 In contrast to M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was outgoing and accessible and he was seen by an increasing number of B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s as a religious leader, rather than just an organizer, and became their center of devotion.48
This was increasingly resented by M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Yahy&lt;U+00E1&gt;, who began trying to discredit Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h,49 which resulted in driving many people away from the religion.50 Tensions in the community mounted, and thus in 1854 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h decided to leave the city to pursue a solitary life.51
Kurdistan
On 10 April 1854, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h left his family to the care of his brother Mirza Musa and traveled with one companion to the mountains of Kurdistan, northeast of Baghdad, near the city of Sulaymaniyah.5253 He later wrote that he left so as to avoid becoming the source of disagreement within the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, and that his &quot;withdrawal contemplated no return&quot;.5455
For two years, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h lived alone in the mountains of Kurdistan.56 He originally lived as a hermit, dressed like a dervish and using the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani.5758 At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders.59 As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, and Shaykh Ism&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;l, leaders of the Naqshband&lt;U+00ED&gt;yyih, Q&lt;U+00E1&gt;dir&lt;U+00ED&gt;yyih, and Kh&lt;U+00E1&gt;lid&lt;U+00ED&gt;yyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice.60 It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h wrote several other notable books during this time.61
In Baghdad, given the lack of firm and public leadership by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray.62 Some Babis, including Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's family, began searching for Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, and when news of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's family begged him to come back to Baghdad.63 On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.64
Return to Baghdad
 When Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h returned to Baghdad he saw that the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community had become disheartened and divided.65 During Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's absence, it had become alienated from the religion because Mirza Yahya had continued his policy of militancy and been unable to provide effective leadership.66 Mirza Yahya had married the widow of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b against the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b's clear instructions;67 dispatched followers to the province of Nur for the second attempt on the life of the Shah;68 and instigated violence against prominent B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s who had challenged his leadership.69
After his return to Baghdad, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h tried to revive the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, mostly through correspondence, writing extensively to give the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s a new understanding of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; religion,70 while keeping his perceived station as the one promised by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b and a Manifestation of God hidden. He was soon recognized by the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, as well as government authorities, as the foremost B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; leader, and there was a growing number of people joining the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; movement.71 He also gained sympathy from government officials and Sunni clerics.72 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's rising influence in the city, and the revival of the Persian B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, gained the attention of his enemies in Islamic clergy and the Persian government.73 The Persian government asked the Ottoman government to extradite Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h to Persia, but the Ottoman government refused and instead chose to move Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h from the sensitive border region to Constantinople.74
Declaration in the Garden of Ridvan
On 21 April 1863, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h left Baghdad and entered the Najibiyyih gardens, now known to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s as the Garden of Ridv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, near Baghdad. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and those accompanying him stayed in the garden for twelve days before departing for Constantinople.75 It was during this time that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h declared to a small group of his companions his perceived mission and station as a Messenger of God.76 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s regard this period with great significance and celebrate the twelve days that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h spent in this Garden as the festival of Ridv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.77 He referred to the period of messianic secrecy between when he claimed to have seen the Maiden of Heaven in the S&lt;U+00ED&gt;y&lt;U+00E1&gt;h-Ch&lt;U+00E1&gt;l and his declaration as the ayyam-i butun (&quot;Days of Concealment&quot;). Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h stated that this period was a &quot;set time of concealment&quot;.78 The declaration in the Garden of Ridv&lt;U+00E1&gt;n was the beginning of a new phase in the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community which led to the emergence of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith as a distinctive movement separate from B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;sm.79
Imprisonment
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was given an order to relocate to the Ottoman capital of Constantinople. Although not a formal prisoner yet, the forced exile from Baghdad was the beginning of a long process which would gradually move him into further exiles and eventually to the penal colony of Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Palestine (now Acre, Israel).
Constantinople
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h travelled from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, accompanied by a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he was treated with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he was treated as a government guest.80 Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was viewed as a person of influence. However, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h refused to work with the Ottoman authorities.81 After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.82
Adrianople

From 1&lt;U+2013&gt;12 December 1863, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and his family travelled to Adrianople. Unlike his travel to Constantinople, this journey was in the nature of an exile.83 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h stayed in Adrianople for four and a half years, and was the clear leader of the newly established B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community there.8485 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's growing preeminence in the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community and in the city at large led to a final breach between Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and Mirza Yahya.86 In 1865, Mirza Yahya was accused of plotting to kill Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h.87 In contemporary accounts, Mirza Yahya is reported to have tried to have Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h assassinated at the hands of the barber of the local bath. The barber, Muhammad `Al&lt;U+00ED&gt; of Isfah&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, apparently refused and spread word of the danger around the community. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is reported to have counselled &quot;on all patience, quietude and gentleness&quot;.88 This pattern was repeated when, according to the personal account of Ust&lt;U+00E1&gt;d Muhammad-`Al&lt;U+00ED&gt;y-i Salm&lt;U+00E1&gt;n&lt;U+00ED&gt;, Mirza Yahya attempted to persuade him likewise to murder Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h in the bath.89 Eventually Mirza Yahya attempted to poison Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, an act that left him gravely ill for a time, and left him with a shaking hand for the rest of his life.9091929394
After this event in 1866, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h made his claim to be &quot;Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest public&quot;,95 as well as making a formal written announcement to Mirza Yahya referring to his followers for the first time as the &quot;people of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;&quot;.96 After his public announcement, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h secluded himself in his house and instructed the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to choose between himself and Mirza Yahya.97 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's claims threatened Mirza Yahya's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s if &quot;Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest&quot; were to appear and start a new religion.98 Mirza Yahya responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;sm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority.99
In 1867, Mirza Yahya challenged Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h to a test of the divine will in a local mosque in Adrianople,100 such that &quot;God would strike down the impostor.&quot; Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h agreed, and went to the Sultan Selim mosque at the appointed time, but Mirza Yahya lost face and lost credibility when he refused to show up.101102103 Eventually Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was recognized by the vast majority of B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s as &quot;He whom God shall make manifest&quot; and his followers began calling themselves Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s.104
Writings and letters to the leaders of the world
 During his time in Adrianople, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the proclamation of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of his statements, as well as asking the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to be united and detached from the world.105 He also started to write about distinctive Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; beliefs and practices.
Also, while in Adrianople, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h proclaimed the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith further by addressing tablets to the kings and rulers of the world asking them to accept his revelation, renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour toward the betterment of the world and its peoples. His first letter was sent to Sultan Abd&lt;U+00FC&gt;laziz of the Ottoman Empire and his ministers, which was followed by the Tablet of the Kings which was a general address to all rulers.106 In that latter letter the rulers of the earth were asked to listen to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's call, and cast away their material possessions, and since they were given the reins of government that they should rule with justice and protect the rights of the downtrodden. He also told the rulers to reduce their armaments and reconcile their differences.107 The Christian monarchs were also asked to be faithful to Jesus' call to follow the promised &quot;Spirit of Truth.&quot;108
Later when Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was in Akka, he continued writing letters to the leaders of the world including:109
Pope Pius IX
Emperor Napoleon III of France
Emperor Alexander II of Russia
King Wilhelm I of Prussia
Queen Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland
Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary
Sultan &lt;U+2018&gt;Abdu&lt;U+2019&gt;l-&lt;U+2018&gt;Az&lt;U+00ED&gt;z of the Ottoman Empire
N&lt;U+00E1&gt;siri&lt;U+2019&gt;d-D&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Sh&lt;U+00E1&gt;h of the Persian Empire
Rulers of America and the Presidents of the republics therein
`Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt;
 With the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt; community now irrevocably divided, the followers of Mirza Yahya tried to discredit Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h to the Ottoman authorities, accusing him of causing agitation against the government.110 While an investigation cleared Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, it did bring to the attention of the government that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and Mirza Yahya were propagating religious claims, and, fearing that this might cause future disorder, they decided to again exile the 'B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;' leaders.111 A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the B&lt;U+00E1&gt;b&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman EmpireÂ &lt;U+2014&gt; Famagusta, Cyprus for Mirza Yahya and his followers, and `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt;, in Ottoman Palestine, for Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and his followers.112
The Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, including Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h and his family, left Adrianople on 12 August 1868, and, after a journey by land and sea through Gallipoli and Egypt, arrived in `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt; on 31 August and were confined in the barracks in the citadel in the city.113 The inhabitants of `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt; were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden. The first years in `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt; imposed very harsh conditions with everyone becoming sick, and eventually three Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s dying.114 It was also a very trying time for Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h: Mirz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Mihd&lt;U+00ED&gt;, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's son, was suddenly killed at the age of twenty-two when he fell through a skylight while pacing back and forth in prayer and meditation. After some time, the people and officials began to trust and respect Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, and thus the conditions of the imprisonment were eased and eventually, after the Sultan's death, he was allowed to leave the city and visit nearby places. From 1877 until 1879 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h lived in the house of Mazra'ih.115
Final years
  The final years of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's life (1879&lt;U+2013&gt;1892) were spent in the Mansion of Bahj&lt;U+00ED&gt;, just outside `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt;, even though he was still formally a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire. During his years in `Akk&lt;U+00E1&gt; and Bahj&lt;U+00ED&gt;, since `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;, his eldest son, had taken care of the organizational work, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was able to devote his time to writing, and he produced many volumes of work including the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas, his book of laws.116 His other works included letters outlining his vision for a united world, as well as the need for ethical action; he also composed many prayers.117
In 1890, the Cambridge orientalist Edward Granville Browne had an interview with Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h in this house. After this meeting he wrote his famous pen-portrait of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h:
&quot;In the corner where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the kind called t&lt;U+00E1&gt;j by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read one's very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!&quot;118119
On 9 May 1892, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h contracted a slight fever which grew steadily over the following days, abated, and then finally took his life on 29 May 1892. He was buried in the shrine located next to the Mansion of Bahj&lt;U+00ED&gt;.120
Claims
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h stated that he was a messenger of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God.121 In the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization.122123 The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations.124125 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.126
In Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's writings he writes in many styles including cases were he speaks as if he was instructed by God to bring a message; in other cases he writes as though he is speaking as God directly.127 In his writings, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's style changes frequently, where in some cases he is speaking as the messenger of God, and then it changes to as if he were speaking as God.128
Some have taken Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's style of writings to conclude that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h had claimed divinity. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world.129 Statements where Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h speaks with the voice of God are meant that he is not actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.130
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h declared, as the most recent Manifestation of God, that he was the &quot;Promised One&quot; of all religions, fulfilling the messianic prophecies found in world religions.131 He stated that his claims to being several messiahs converging in one person were the symbolic, rather than literal, fulfilment of the messianic and eschatological prophecies found in the literature of the major religions.132 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's eschatological claims constitute six distinctive messianic identifications: from Judaism, the incarnation of the &quot;Everlasting Father&quot; from the Yuletide prophecy of Isaiah 9:6, the &quot;Lord of Hosts&quot;; from Christianity, the &quot;Spirit of Truth&quot; or Comforter predicted by Jesus in his farewell discourse of John 14-17 and the return of Christ &quot;in the glory of the Father&quot;; from Zoroastrianism, the return of Shah Bahram Varjavand, a Zoroastrian messiah predicted in various late Pahlavi texts; from Shi'a Islam the return of the Third Imam, Imam Husayn; from Sunni Islam, the return of Jesus (Isa);133 and from B&lt;U+00E1&gt;bism, He whom God shall make manifest.134
While Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h did not himself directly claim to be either the Hindu or Buddhist messiah, he did so in principle through his writings.135 Later, `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; stated that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction.136 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s also believe that Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is the fulfilment of the prophecy of appearance of the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma.137138 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s believe that the prophecy that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's teachings on world peace.139 Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is believed to be a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty;140 he also asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.141
Succession
After Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h named `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's writings.142143 This appointment given to `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; was a cause of jealousy within Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's family. Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h also stated that another one of his sons M&lt;U+00ED&gt;rz&lt;U+00E1&gt; Muhammad `Al&lt;U+00ED&gt; was subordinate and second in rank after `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;.144 `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s appointment as Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's successors was readily accepted by almost all Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, as the appointment was written and unambiguous, and `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; had already proved himself a capable and devoted assistant.145 , however, insisted that `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; was exceeding his powers, and started a rebellion, at first covert, and then public to discredit `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;. 's actions, however, were rejected by the majority of the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s.146 Due to this conflict, `Abdu'l-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt; later ex-communicated him as a covenant-breaker. The conflict was not long lived; after being alienated by the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; community, Muhammad Ali died in 1937 with only a handful of followers.
Works
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h wrote many books, tablets and prayers, of which only a fraction has been translated into English until now.147 There have been 15,000 works written by him identified so far; many of these are in the form of short letters, or tablets, to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s,148 but he also wrote larger pieces including the Book of Certitude, the Hidden Words and the Gems of Divine Mysteries.149 The total volume of his works are more than 70 times the size of the Qur'an and more than 15 times the size of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.150151152
The books and letters written by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h cover religious doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, social and moral teachings as well as Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; laws; he also wrote many prayers.153 Jin&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-F&lt;U+00E1&gt;dil-i-M&lt;U+00E1&gt;zindar&lt;U+00E1&gt;n&lt;U+00ED&gt;, analyzing Baha'u'llah's writings, states that he wrote in the different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings.154 All of his works are considered by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to be revelation, even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim.155156 Some of his better known works that have been translated into English include Gleanings, the Hidden Words, the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-Aqdas and the Kit&lt;U+00E1&gt;b-i-&lt;U+00CD&gt;q&lt;U+00E1&gt;n.
Photographs and imagery
 There are two known photographs of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h. This photo was taken for passport purposes while he was in Adrianople (present day Edirne) and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s view it as part of an organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s prefer not to view this photo in public, or even to display it in their private homes,157 and Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; institutions have requested the press not to publish the image in the media.158
Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's image is not, itself, offensive to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s. However, Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s are expected to treat the image of any Manifestation of God with extreme reverence. According to this practice, they avoid depictions of Jesus or of Muhammad, and refrain from portraying any of them in plays and drama. For example, copies of the photographs are displayed on highly significant occasions, such as six conferences held in October 1967 commemorating the centenary of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h's writing of the Suriy-i-Mul&lt;U+00FA&gt;k (Tablet to the Kings), which Shoghi Effendi describes as &quot;the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h&quot;.159 After a meeting in Adrianople, the Hands of the Cause travelled to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view.'160
The official Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; position on displaying the photograph of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is:
&quot;There is no objection that the believers look at the picture of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h, but they should do so with the utmost reverence, and should also not allow that it be exposed openly to the public, even in their private homes.&quot;
(From a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to an individual believer, 6 December 1939)161
While the above passage clarifies that it is considered disrespectful to display his photograph to the public, regarding postings on other websites the Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; World Centre has written:
&quot;For Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s, the photograph of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h is very precious and it should not only be viewed but also handled with due reverence and respect, which is not the case here [on a non-Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt; web site]. Thus, it is indeed disturbing to Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;s to have the image of Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'u'll&lt;U+00E1&gt;h treated in such a disrespectful way. However, as the creator of the site is not a Bah&lt;U+00E1&gt;'&lt;U+00ED&gt;, there is little, if anything, that can be done to address this matter. We hope these comments have been of assistance.&quot;
