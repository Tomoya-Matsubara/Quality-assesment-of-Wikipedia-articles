 This is a list of Grey Cup champions. The Grey Cup is both the name of the championship of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the name of the trophy awarded to the victorious team. The trophy is named after Albert Grey, the Governor General of Canada from 1904 until 1911. He donated the trophy to the Canadian Rugby Union in 1909 to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. By this time Canadian football had become markedly different from the rugby football from which it developed. Although it was originally intended to be awarded only to amateur teams (like the Stanley Cup), over time, the Grey Cup became the property of the Canadian Football League as it evolved into a professional football league. Amateur teams ceased competing for the Cup by 1954; since 1965, the top amateur teams, playing in Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), have competed for the Vanier Cup.1
First awarded in 1909, there have since been 95 Grey Cup championship games, although there was no game from 1916 to 1919.2 It is Canada's largest annual sports and television event, regularly drawing a Canadian viewing audience of about 4 million.34 Two awards are given for play in the game, Most Valuable Player and the Dick Suderman Trophy as most valuable Canadian player.5

Win/Loss records
Although the official website of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats counts them as the same team, the Tiger-Cats, Hamilton Alerts, Hamilton Tigers and Hamilton Flying Wildcats are all listed separately6 because when they were active, the teams competed as separate franchises and in 1950, the Tigers and Flying Wildcats merged to create the Tiger-Cats.7
