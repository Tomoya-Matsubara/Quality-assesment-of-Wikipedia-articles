System Shock 2 (commonly abbreviated SS2 or Shock 2) is a  first person  action role-playing video game, designed by Ken Levine. The title was co-developed by Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios as a stand alone title, heavily influenced by the seminal 1994 PC game System Shock. After Electronic Arts signed on to publish, story changes were made to incorporate the Shock franchise. System Shock 2 was released on August 11, 1999 by Electronic Arts.
The game takes place on board an adrift starship in a cyberpunk vision of 2114. The player assumes the role of a lone soldier who tries to stem the outbreak of a genetic infection that has devastated the ship. Gameplay mainly consists of first person action and exploration, while a  role-playing system allows the player to develop unique abilities and traits.1
System Shock 2 received positive reviews when released,2 but failed to meet commercial sales expectations.3 The game has since become a cult classic,4 and is widely regarded by critics as one of the greatest ever made.5678 In 2007, Irrational—now 2K Boston/2K Australia—released a self-proclaimed spiritual successor to the System Shock series, entitled BioShock, to critical acclaim9 and strong sales.10 Rumors that a third installment in the Shock series may be under development have circulated since 2006.11
Gameplay
 Like its predecessor, gameplay in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of the first person shooter and  role-playing game (RPG) genres. The player uses various weapons to defeat enemies, while a  role-playing system allows the player to develop a variety of useful skills. Navigation is presented from a first-person perspective and complemented with a  heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.12 Backstory is explained progressively through the acquisition of audio logs.13
When the game begins, the player must pursue a career in a fictional military, the Unified National Nominate. Each branch of service introduces its own unique skills: The  marines are combat experts and augment weapon proficiency; the Navy demonstrate expertise in engineering and  hacking; and the OSA is a paranormal branch of military that hones psychic powers.14
After choosing a branch and undergoing a character development stage, the player begins receiving &quot;cyber-modules&quot; for completing objectives. Skills are enhanced by spending cyber-modules at devices called &quot;cyber-upgrade units&quot;15 O/S units allow special one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement), while in-game currency, called &quot;nanites&quot;, may be spent on items at vending machines. &quot;Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines&quot; can be activated and reconstitute the player if they die in the same area. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a  save point.16
Some devices, like keypads, gun turrets, and vending machines, can be hacked. When a hack is attempted, a minigame commences where a grid of green nodes appear. Three nodes must be connected in a straight row for the hack to succeed. As the game progresses, objects become increasingly difficult to hack and red nodes appear. Red nodes are unstable and can cause the object being hacked to break or explode if a connection is attempted. Optionally, electronic  lock picks can be found that automatically hack a device, regardless of its difficulty.17
Various weapons can be procured throughout the game, including pistols, shotguns, and alien melee weapons.18 All non-melee weapons degrade with use and eventually break. Repairing them with maintenance tools ensures they continue functioning.19 Different kinds of ammunition exist, which can give the player an advantage over susceptible enemies. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical ones are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Because ammunition is scarce, the player must remain vigilant to unload weapons and carefully search rooms for supplies.20 In addition to weapons, psychic powers can be learned that perform a variety of actions, such as acquiring out-of-reach items via telepathy and hurling energy balls at enemies.21
Plot summary
Prologue
The story begins in 2114, forty-two years after the events of System Shock, on the Von Braun; an experimental faster-than-light starship, owned by the fictional TriOptimum Corporation. The ship is undergoing its maiden voyage with the Rickenbacker, a military starship serving as an escort.22 After joining the United National Nominate and completing its training regimen, the unnamed protagonist&lt;U+2014&gt;Soldier G65434-2&lt;U+2014&gt; is assigned to the Rickenbacker.23
A few months into the voyage, the two ships respond to a distress signal from the planet Tau Ceti V.24 A rescue team is sent to the planet surface where they discover strange eggs.25 The eggs infect the rescue team and integrate them into an alien communion who call themselves the Many. The infestation eventually infects both ships, including XERXES, the Von Braun's main computer.
Story
The soldier awakens in a  cryo-tube on the medical deck of the Von Braun with amnesia due to a computer malfunction. He is immediately contacted by a survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, who guides him to safety before the  cabin depressurizes. Polito demands the soldier to rendezvous with her on deck 4.26 Along the way, the soldier battles the infected crew members. The Many also telepathically communicate with him, persuading the soldier to join their collective.
After restarting the ship's engine core and purging an elevator shaft, the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers Polito is dead. He is then confronted by SHODAN, a malevolent artificial intelligence who seized control of TriOptimum&lt;U+2019&gt;s space vessel, Citadel Station, forty-two years prior in System Shock. She informs the soldier that she has been posing as Polito to gain his trust27 and is responsible for the creation of the Many. Together, SHODAN and the Many escaped Citadel station's destruction in a jettisoned subsection and landed on Tau Ceti V thirty years later.28 SHODAN had been cultivating these artificial creatures to help establish her god-hood, but they had evolved out of her control.29 SHODAN issues an ultimatum to the soldier, stating his only chance for survival lies in helping destroy her rebellious creations.30
After failing to gain control of the Von Braun via a transmission device, SHODAN informs the soldier that destroying the ship is their only option, but he must first transfer SHODAN&lt;U+2019&gt;s program to the Rickenbacker.31 The soldier proceeds to complete his task and briefly encounters two survivors, Tommy Suarez and Rebbecca Siddons, who flee the ship in an escape pod.32
After completing the transfer, the soldier travels to the Rickenbacker and learns both ships have been enveloped by the infection's source, a gigantic mass of bio-organic tissue called the body of the Many.33 The soldier enters the biomass and destroys its core, stopping the alien infection. SHODAN congratulates the protagonist and informs him she intends to merge real space and cyberspace using the Von Braun's faster-than-light drive.34 The soldier confronts SHODAN in cyberspace and defeats her.
The final scene shows Tommy and Rebecca receiving a message from the Von Braun. Tommy responds, saying they will return but Rebbecca is feeling ill. Rebbecca is shown speaking similarly to SHODAN.
Development
 Development began in 1997 when Looking Glass Studios approached upstart Irrational Games with an idea to co-develop a new game.35 System Shock was a heavy influence as the development team were big fans and wanted to make a similar game. Early story ideas were inspired by the novella, Heart of Darkness. In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a devastated starship.36
While the design was pitched to publishers, Electronic Arts contacted Irrational, suggesting they alter the game and make System Shock 2. The development team agreed, and story changes were made to incorporate the Shock franchise.37 The project was allotted one year for development. To compensate for the short time frame, the development team began working with Looking Glass Studio's unfinished Dark Engine.38
Irrational wanted System Shock 2 to include RPG elements, specifically a &quot;combination of System Shock and Ultima Underworld.&quot; Similar to Ultima Underworld, another Looking Glass Studio project, the environment in System Shock 2 is  persistent and constantly changes.3940  Paper and pencil RPGs were also influential; the character customization system was based on  Traveller's methodology. This design allowed multiple character paths and a more open-ended gameplay experience.41
Horror was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was primary, resulting in little physical contact with other sentient beings. The development team also felt vulnerability was a key factor. Instead of making the player very strong, they focused on a fragile character. The last two points were the inclusion of moody sound effects and &quot;the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows&quot;.42
The game's lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of System Shock villain, SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with SHODAN,43 but he also believed game characters were too trusting, stating &quot;good guys are good, bad guys are bad. What you see and perceive is real.&quot; Levine challenged this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: &quot;Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the player never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that they, and not [only] the character, were led on and deceived&quot; This design choice was controversial with the development team.44
Several problems were encountered during the development of System Shock 2. Because the team comprised two software companies, negative tension existed regarding job assignments. Some developers left the project altogether, and many more were largely inexperienced. In a postmortem feature, Project manager Jonathan Chey reflected optimism, stating &quot;...inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment that might not have been present with a more jaded set of developers.&quot; The Dark Engine posed problems of its own. It lacked a defined  API and was unfinished, forcing the development team to fix software bugs when encountered. Sometimes working with the engine code was advantageous and allowed the development team to write additional engine features.45 One particular setback remained political when Irrational was asked to remove the guns from their E3 demonstration after the recent Columbine High School massacre.46
A  demo for the game, featuring a tutorial and a third of the first mission, was released on August 2, 1999.47 Nine days later, System Shock 2 was shipped to retailers48 and received acclaim from numerous critics.49 The title took 18 months to develop with a budget of $1.7 million.50 A  patch was released a month later and added significant features, such as co-operative multiplayer and control over weapon degradation and enemy  respawn rates.51 A port was planned for the Dreamcast, but was subsequently canceled.52

System Shock 2 received over a dozen awards, including seven &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards by publications, such as Game Revolution and USA Today.62 Reviews were very positive and applauded the title for its hybrid gameplay, moody sound design, and engaging story.63 Despite critical acclaim, the title failed to meet commercial sales expectations.64
Many publications praised the title for its open-ended gameplay. With regard to character customization, IGN stated, &lt;U+201C&gt;The great thing about this system is that it allows you to play the game as completely different characters which gives the game an entirely different feel.&quot;65 Erik Reckase writing for Just Adventure agreed, saying &lt;U+201C&gt;There are very few games that allow you [to] play the way you want to&lt;U+201D&gt;.66 Alec Norands of Allgame found the gameplay &lt;U+201C&gt;diverse enough to demand instant replayability.67
Critics described the game as quite frightening. Colin of Game Revolution attested that the game rivaled the terror of Resident Evil 2 and Silent Hill, stating &quot;this game is brimming with horror&lt;U+201D&gt;.68  CVG described the atmosphere as &lt;U+201C&gt;gripping&lt;U+201D&gt; and guaranteed readers they would &quot;jump out of [their] skin on more than one occasion&lt;U+201D&gt;.69 Norands found the sound design particularly effective, calling it &lt;U+201C&gt;absolutely, teeth-clenchingly disturbing,&lt;U+201D&gt;70 while PC Gamer editor, William Harms, christened System Shock 2 &lt;U+201C&gt;the most unsettling and frightening game [he had] ever played.&lt;U+201D&gt;71
One of the most common criticisms centered on the weapon degradation system, which causes weapons to wear out and eventually break through excessive use. The system was designed to add tension by making the player consider his ammunition reserve.72 Despite this, many critics found it to be annoying.737475 Members of the development team have also expressed misgivings about the system.7677 A patch was later released, allowing the player to control the degradation rate or disable it altogether.78
The RPG system was another point of contention. Desslock of GameSpot described the job system as &quot;badly unbalanced&quot; due to the player's ability to develop any skills, regardless of their career choice.79 Norands felt similarly about the system, saying it &quot;leaned towards a hacker character&quot;.80
Legacy
System Shock 2 is regarded by some as highly influential, particularly on first-person shooters. In a retrospective article, Gamespot declared the title &quot;well ahead of its time&quot; and stated it &quot;upped the ante in dramatic and mechanical terms, creating an utterly engrossing, terrifying gameplay experience&quot;. Along with Deus Ex, GamePro christened System Shock 2 one of the &quot;twin barrels of modern FPS innovation&quot;, due to its &quot;deep and intricate role-playing gameplay&quot;.81 IGN referred to the game as &quot;another reinvention of the  FPS genre...Story-driven, with great characters and a number of RPG elements, System Shock 2 was a game that had you on the edge of your seat.&quot;82 The title has been inducted into a number of features listing the greatest games ever made, including ones by Gamespy,83  Edge,84 IGN,85 and Gamespot.86
The return of SHODAN has been observed as an innovation itself. Gamespot described her revelation to the player as &quot;one of the most shocking and effective video game plot devices [they had] ever encountered.&quot;87 Gamespy stated, that with SHODAN's inclusion System Shock 2 &quot;really became a complete experience instead of just another game.&quot;88 SHODAN has proven to be a popular character among some critics; among these are IGN,89 Gamespot,90 and  the Phoenix.91
System Shock 2 has amassed a substantial cult following over the years. Many fans have demanded a sequel.92 Some fans are active in the modding community where collaborations to update the game's graphics take place. One graphical enhancement  mod, entitled Rebirth, replaces many  low-polygonal  models with high-quality ones.93 Another mod, the Shock Texture Upgrade Project (SHTUP), significantly increases the  resolution of in-game  textures.94
In 2007, 2K Boston/2K Australia&lt;U+2014&gt;previously known as Irrational Games&lt;U+2014&gt;released a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, entitled BioShock.95 The game takes place in an abandoned underwater utopian community that has gone awry through the genetic modification of its populace. The game has been very successful commercially96 and critically.97 BioShock shares many gameplay elements with System Shock 2: reconstitution stations can be found allowing the player to be resurrected when death occurs;  hacking, ammo conservation, and exploration are integral parts of gameplay; and various powers may be acquired via plasmids, special abilities that function similarly to psionic powers in System Shock 2.98 The two titles also share similar plots and employ audio logs to reveal backstory.99
On January 9, 2006, GameSpot reported that Electronic Arts had renewed its trademark protection on the System Shock name100 leading to speculation that a System Shock 3 might be under development.101 Three days later,  CVG reported that a reliable source had come forward and confirmed the development of the purported title. EA UK made no comments when confronted with the information.102 PC Gamer UK expanded these rumors further, stating EA had charged the team behind  The Godfather with developing System Shock 3.103 Ken Levine, when asked whether he would helm a third installment, replied, &quot;that question is completely out of my hands.&quot;104 He expressed optimism at the prospect of System Shock 3,105 but was also critical of EA's attitude towards development of the game.106107 As of January 2009, nothing conclusive has been reported regarding the status of the title.108

Korenchkin: We have picked up a transmission from the surface of Tau Ceti V. I have been in negotiation with Captain Diego of the Rickenbacker and after some... coercion, he's agreed to go planet side as a joint venture. Imagine, this historic mission might even become more historic. First Contact. And who is there to get exclusive rights to all media, patents and land grants? TriOptimum. Miri, I told you this would be worth it. ↩
Bayliss: After a couple of hours it was... it was like being on a bender... long periods that you couldn't remember... one minute we were in that crater... the next minute we were loading up the shuttle with the eggs... I remember hearing that idiot Korenchkin calling the Von Braun and ordering them to clear off the ENTIRE hydroponics deck. Diego seemed to think this was strange and said, 'Are you crazy, Anatoly?' And Korenchkin smiled and said back to him, 'Oh, Captain... WE are not Anatoly... ↩
Polito: Make sure you expend all your cybernetic modules before you leave this area. You don't know when you'll find another upgrade unit. Now, find a way to deck 4. ↩
SHODAN: I used Polito's image to communicate with you, until we had established trust. ↩
SHODAN: It ejected the grove, where my creations, and processing component, 43893, were stored. Thirty years later, the grove crash-landed on Tau Ceti V. I survived only by sleeping. In my absence, my creations, my annelids, thrived. ↩
SHODAN: Thrived, and grew unruly. And now they seek to destroy me. I will not allow that. ↩
SHODAN: Remember, that it is my will that guided you here; it is my will that gave you your cybernetic implants&lt;U+2014&gt;the only beauty in that meat you call a body. If you value that meat, you will do as I tell you. ↩
SHODAN: My creation has run rampant. I demand their extermination. I have no choice but to destroy this starship. We can make our escape in the Rickenbacker, but you must transfer my intelligence to that ship first. ↩
Siddons: Move it, Tommy... the escape pod is this way! ↩
SHODAN: The Many has grown to a massive size. It has wrapped itself around these two ships, preventing their separation. ↩
Delacroix: You must understand the stakes here... if SHODAN is left to continue, her reality will completely assimilate ours. Space will become cyberspace and SHODAN's whims will become reality. ↩
