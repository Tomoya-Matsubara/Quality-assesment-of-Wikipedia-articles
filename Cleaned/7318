Gary Michael Null (born in 1945) is an American talk radio host and author on alternative and complementary medicine and nutrition. On his talk radio show and in his books and self-produced movies, Null has criticized the medical community, promoted a range of alternative cancer treatments and dietary supplements, and questioned the link between HIV and AIDS.
In 2010, Null reported that he had been poisoned and nearly killed by ingesting one of his own dietary supplements, &quot;Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal&quot;. Null sued a contractor involved in producing the supplement, alleging that it contained more than 1,000 times the dose of vitamin D reported on the label, leading to the hospitalization of Null and six other consumers with vitamin poisoning.123
Early life and education
Null was raised in Parkersburg, West Virginia, with his two brothers. He holds an Associate Degree in Business Administration as well as a Bachelor of Science degree from Thomas Edison State College in Trenton, New Jersey. He received a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Studies from Union Institute &amp; University, a private distance-learning college in Cincinnati, Ohio.4 Null's thesis was entitled &quot;A Study of Psychological and Physiological Effects of Caffeine on Human Health.&quot; His credentials and the rigor of his Ph.D. program were questioned by Stephen Barrett of Quackwatch.5 Null is a New York State Certified dietitian-nutritionist.6
Viewpoints
Null attacks many facets of mainstream medicine, arguing that physicians have an economic interest in promoting rather than preventing sickness. In the 1970s, Null co-authored a series of articles on cancer research for Penthouse, beginning with one entitled &quot;The Great Cancer Fraud.&quot;Null's articles on alternative cancer therapies in Penthouse include:
 In Penthouse, Null accused the medical community of &quot;suppressing alternative cancer treatments to protect the medical establishment's solid-gold cancer train.&quot; In place of standard medical therapy, Null advocated alternative cancer treatments such as hydrazine sulfate. In 1999 TIME wrote of Null's conspiracy claims: &quot;From a young reporter this is to be expected. But two decades later, Null, 54, is still warning of a variety of medical bogeymen out to gull a trusting public.&quot;7
In addition to his promotion of alternative cancer treatments, Null has argued that HIV is harmless and does not cause AIDS.8 In his book AIDS: A Second Opinion, Null questioned the role of antiretroviral medication and instead advocated a range of dietary supplements for HIV-positive individuals. His book was criticized as &quot;massive, irresponsible and nearly unreadable&quot; by Salon.com,9 and Seth Kalichman cited Null as a prominent proponent of AIDS denialism, cashing in on HIV/AIDS and repeating the claims of other denialists. Kalichman compared Null's activities to Holocaust denial and stated that Null was an example of a dangerous entrepreneur who &quot;obviously breached&quot; the balance between free speech versus protecting public health.10
In 2009, Null was the keynote speaker at a rally opposing mandatory H1N1 influenza vaccination during the 2009 pandemic, leading the state health department to dismiss Null's claims about the vaccine as &quot;not scientifically credible.&quot;11
Radio and video work
Null began broadcasting a syndicated radio talk show, Natural Living with Gary Null in 1980. His show was broadcast first on WBAI, then on the VoiceAmerica Network and over the internet. Null's show subsequently returned to WBAI, leading to protests from ACT-UP New York and other AIDS activist groups concerned by Null's promotion of AIDS denialism.1213
Null has made several self-funded and self-produced documentary films on public policy issues, personal health, and development. His videos have been aired by PBS during pledge drives, but concern arose within PBS over the videos' sensational claims. Ervin Duggan, the president of PBS, expressed concern that by showing Null's videos, the network was &quot;open[ing] the door to quacks and charlatans.&quot;14 Null implied that his problems with PBS may have been an attempt to silence him, saying: &quot;The guardians of the gates of orthodoxy at PBS... you don't know who their friends are.&quot;15
Dietary supplements and vitamin poisoning
Null owns Gary Null &amp; Associates, a company that markets dietary supplements, as well as a health-food store in New York City.16 In 2010, Null claimed that he was sickened and nearly killed by his own dietary supplements.171819 He filed suit against a contractor involved in producing the supplement, &quot;Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal&quot;, claiming that the supplement contained 1,000 times the labeled dose of Vitamin D and that it had led to the hospitalizations of 6 consumers poisoned by excessive doses of the vitamin.20 Null reportedly suffered severe pain and kidney damage from &quot;Gary Null's Ultimate Power Meal&quot;, but continued consuming the supplement in the belief that it would relieve his symptoms.21
The New York Post noted that Null's near-death experience with his own supplement brand was &quot;not exactly a ringing endorsement.&quot;22 The Los Angeles Times wrote that Null's experience &quot;should give pause to anyone lured by the extravagant claims of many supplements makers&quot;, and noted that it was common for dietary supplements to contain doses &quot;wildly different than those indicated on their label&quot; as a result of weak regulation.23 Null's attorney cast the alleged vitamin poisoning as an isolated incident, saying: &quot;We don't want anything to affect the physical well-being of anyone or the reputation of the company.&quot;24
