Brockenhurst F.C. is a football club from Brockenhurst, near Lymington, in Hampshire, England. It was founded in 1898 and played mostly in friendlies before eventually joining the New Forest League. The club moved up to the Hampshire League in 1924 but after only two seasons at the higher level dropped back into the New Forest League. Elevation to the Hampshire League was achieved for a second time in 1935, but again the stay was a short one and Brockenhurst fell back into the New Forest League in 1937. In 1947 the club again moved up to the Hampshire League and this time the promotion proved to be sustainable - the Badgers remaining a fixture in that league until 1986.
History
In 1986 Brockenhurst became a founding member of the Wessex League and has remained in that league ever since. Currently in the top division of that league, the Badgers have been a consistently mid-table outfit with just two seasons proving to be notable exceptions. In 2002 the New Forest side finished 5th in the competition (the clubs highest ever placing) but in 2006 relegation loomed as the club slumped to a disappointing 21st. (Only a league re-structure saved the Badgers from the drop)
Away from the bread and butter of league football the club has been a regular entrant in both the FA Cup and FA Vase, reaching the third qualifying round of the FA Cup three times, while the best Vase run was in that competition's first season, 1974&lt;U+2013&gt;75, when The Badgers reached the fifth round (last 16).

Stadia
The club has had three homes - Rhinefield Road, Brookley Road and, since 1950, the current home ground - Grigg Lane.
The Grigg Lane ground (which recently won an award from the Wessex League) can be found in the centre of the village. There are two turnstiles allowing entrance to the ground - one in Grigg Lane itself and the other in Fathersfield on the opposite side of the stadium. On match days a small tea bar and a snack bar operate.
There is a clubhouse with snooker and pool tables, dartboards, table football and Sky TV. There is also an extensive bar and a heated outdoor patio/BBQ area fills in the gap between the clubhouse and the main grandstand.
