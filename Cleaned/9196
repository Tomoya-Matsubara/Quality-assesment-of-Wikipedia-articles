Joseph Emley Borden (May 9, 1854 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 14, 1929) was an American starting pitcher in professional baseball for two seasons. Born in Jacobstown, New Jersey, his recored professional team was the Philadelphia White Stockings of the National Association {NA) in . It was during the 1875 season that he pitched the first no-hitter in a professional game.
When the NA folded after the 1875 season, he joined the Boston Red Caps, formerly the Red Stockings who had transferred operations to the newly established National League {NL) for the  season. He is credited with a pitching victory in the NL's first game on April 22, and pitched a shutout on May 23, which some claim was the first no-hitter in Major League Baseball. Known for having an eccentric personality, he played under different surnames, such as Josephs and Nedrob. Little is known about his post-baseball life, and his death has been reportedly as early as 1889 in the Johnstown Flood, but it is officially recognized as occuring in 1929 at the age of 75.
Career
Born as Joseph Emley Borden in Jacobstown, New Jersey, on May 9, 1854, into a prominent family, was known to have an eccentric personality.12 He pitched his entire two-season professional baseball career under the last name of Josephs, as well using Nedrob, which is Borden spelled backward.3
1875 season
He first appeared in a professional baseball game on July 24, 1875 with Philadelphia White Stockings of the National Association.4 During his time with the White Stockings, he pitched in seven games, all of which he started and completed.5 He pitched two shutouts in 1875, however, the one on July 28 was a no-hitter against the Chicago White Stockings.67 This is considered the first no-hitter ever thrown in a professional game, since the National Association is not considered a Major League. The umpire for the game was future National League (NL) President Nicholas Young.89 He finished the season with a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;4 Win&lt;U+2013&gt;loss record, and a 1.50 earned run average in 66 innings pitched.10
1876 season
After the 1875 season closed, the league, and subsequently the Philadelphia White Stockings, folded, allowing for the National League (NL) to be founded as the first Major League.11 Borden signed a three-year contract worth $2000 a season with the Boston Red Caps of the NL before the 1876 season.12 The club had hoped that he could adequately fill in for the recently departed Albert Spalding, who had moved on to play for the Chicago White Stockings.13 Hall of fame baseball writer Henry Chadwick described Borden's pitching style as fast, but without strategy.14 In addiction to a swiftly-moving fastball, he also delivered a curveball that moved down and away from right-handed batters, both of which he threw from a low angle.15 His Red Caps played the Philadelphia Athletics in the first game in NL history on April 22; due to other games being cancelled becuase of rain showers, it was the only game played that day. The Red Caps defeated the Athletics with two runs by the score of 6&lt;U+2013&gt;5 at Athletic Park, with Borden pitching the complete game for the victory.16
On May 23, Borden seemingly pitched a two-hit shutout, 8&lt;U+2013&gt;0 victory against the Cincinnati Reds, but some historians claim that this was, in fact, the first no-hitter thrown in the NL, thus becoming the first Major League no-hitter.17 According to Lee Allen, baseball historian and writer, the scorecard shows that Borden gave up two bases on balls, which were counted as hits in the final score.18 The offical scorekeeper for the game was O. P. Caylor, a writer for The Cincinnati Enquirer, who believed, unlike his contemporaries, that bases on balls should be scored as hits.19 Bases on balls were not official counted as hits until , but officially reverted following that season.20 This hypothesis is not without dispute however; The Boston Daily Globe reported on the game the following day, and noted that Reds had, in fact had two clean one-base hits during the game.21 Furthermore, on June 6, the New York Clipper did not report an occurance of a no-hitter in their report of the game, though the box score did have differing stats in other categories than what the Daily Globe had reported.22 Consequently, the first official no-hitter in Major League history was pitched by George Bradley, of the St. Louis Brown Stockings on July 15, 1876.23
Two days after his controversial near no-hitter, on May 25, Borden and the Red Caps faced the Reds again; this time against Cherokee Fisher, resulting in a scoreless game through nine innings.24 The Red Caps scored four runs in tenth inning for a 4-0 victory.25 Unfortunely for Borden, his pitching effectivelness declined rapidly after this, at one point he reportedly threw a tantrum during a game, due to his inaccurate pitching, even admonishing his teammate, future Hall of famer George Wright, who was known to be a good-natured person.26 Due to his erratic pitching and behavior, he was released from the team by August.2728
Post-baseball career
Though the Red Caps still had released him as a player, they still employed him as a ticket-taker and groundskeeper due to the fact that he was still under contract.29 He also reportedly found work stitching baseballs in Philadelphia.30Little is known of Borden's life after baseball, and it has been alledged that he died in May of 1889 during the Johnstown Flood, the same disaster that stranded the entire Louisville Colonels team.31 Official he died in Yeadon, Pennsylvania at the age of 75, and is interred at Oaklands Cemetery in West Chester, Pennsylvania.32
