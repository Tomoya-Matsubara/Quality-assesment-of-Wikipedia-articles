Archipelago Sea Naval Command (, ) is a Finnish Navy unit headquartered in Pansio, Turku. Its main operating area is the Archipelago Sea. Archipelago Sea Naval Command was formed in 1998 by combining the Archipelago Sea Fleet and Turku Coastal Regiment.
The main duty of the Archipelago Sea Naval Command during normal condition is the surveillance of Finnish territorial waters and maintaining territorial integrity. In addition, the Command trains conscripts to fulfil duties in the crisis-time organization of the Command. The Command is always at the state of enhanced readiness, prepared to repel unauthorized incursions to Finnish waters using force. In a crisis, securing the sea lanes for the use of Finnish commercial shipping would be the main duty of the Command.1
Turku Coastal Battalion's Sea Company (Merikomppania, MeriK) has an NCO School with Navy and Military Police lines, as well Marine Engineer Platoon. ACNC does not give basic training for conscripts anymore, as all Finnish Navy conscripts are trained at Gulf of Finland Naval Command's Navy Training Centre at Upinniemi.
