Gij&lt;U+00F3&gt;n (Asturian: Xix&lt;U+00F3&gt;n) is a coastal industrial city and its municipality in the autonomous community of Asturias in Spain. Early mediaeval texts mention it as &quot;Gigia&quot;. It was an important regional Roman city, although the area has been settled since earliest history. The name was originally applied to a small peninsula presently referred to as Cimadevilla, literally &quot;top of village,&quot; between two beaches, one of which has a recreational port today. The main port, one of the largest in the north of Spain, is called &quot;El Musel&quot;. Gij&lt;U+00F3&gt;n has a growing population of approximately 275,000 (2005).
