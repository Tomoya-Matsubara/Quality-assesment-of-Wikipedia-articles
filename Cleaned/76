Furuseth stayed in Brann for three seasons, before he moved to Sweden and &lt;U+00D6&gt;rebro SK. During the first half of the 2004 season, Olsen was a great attraction in the Allsvenskan, and it did not take long until he caught the eye of Hammarby. In September 2004, a &lt;U+00D6&gt;rebro in heavy debts was forced to sell him to league rivals Hammarby IF. In Stockholm, Furuseth Olsen was transformed from striker to right winger, and was awarded &quot;Player of the year 2006&quot; by the Hammarby-fans.8 In October 2006, Furuseth Olsen made it clear that he were to leave Hammarby and Sweden, to return home to Norway, the reason being that he wanted to gain a spot on the Norwegian national football team.9
He transferred to Stab&lt;U+00E6&gt;k Fotball ahead of the 2007-season, but because of a conflict with Daniel Nannskog and the other players,10 he only played 4 matches for Stab&lt;U+00E6&gt;k and signed for the Danish Viborg in June 2007.11 The following winter, Furuseth transferred to FC Midtjylland, but after three rounds of the 2008&lt;U+2013&gt;09-season he asked to be released the contract and decided to retire.1213
Furuseth decided to make comeback in January 2009, and signed a two-year contract with Lyn. He was transferred from FC Midtjylland, still formally his employer, for an undisclosed fee.14 Furuseth played only two matches for Lyn in Tippeligaen during the first half of the season, and he was loaned out to Assyriska so that Lyn, a club with mayor economic difficulties, could save some wage-expenses.1516 On 10 March 2010, his contract with Lyn was terminated by mutual consent,17 and Furuseth moved back to Hammarby.18
Furuseth moved back to Norway once more, and was signed by Moss as a playing assistant coach in February 2012, where he was working under the command of Tor Thodesen, the coach who signed Furuseth from Eik-T&lt;U+00F8&gt;nsberg to Brann in 2000.1920 Furuseth left Moss in August 2012, blaiming personal reasons, and joined his old club Eik in the Third Division two weeks later,21 where he was a part of the coaching staff. Ahead of the 2013 season, Furuseth joined Hus&lt;U+00F8&gt;y &amp; Foynland IF as a player-coach.22
