Judge John Deed is a BBC television drama produced by One-Eyed Dog for BBC One. It was created by G. F. Newman (known for Law and Order) and follows Sir John Deed (played by Martin Shaw), a High Court judge, who tries to seek real justice in the cases before him. It also stars Jenny Seagrove as barrister Jo Mills, frequently the object of Deed's desire. The pilot episode was broadcast on 9 January 2001 and the first full series followed on 26 November 2001. The sixth and most recent series concluded on 18 January 2007. The series remains on a break until the style is changed and due to Martin Shaw's involvement in a new series. After six years on air, Judge John Deed is the longest-running BBC legal drama.
The factual accuracy of the series is often criticised by newspapers and legal professionals; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman has caused some judges to issue warnings to juries not to let the series influence their view of trials, specifically an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury duty. Another episode led to complaints about biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to ban repeats of it in its original form. The first two series have been released on DVD in the UK.
Production
G.F. Newman devised his new series to highlight what he believed to be an out-of-touch judiciary and show &quot;solutions&quot; (a style that differed from his previous work, such as his 1970s series Law and Order, which was heavily critical of the police).12 Newman writes the series intending to give the audience an exploration of the law without patronising them or getting caught up in an explanation of legal proceedings.3 A full series was commissioned before the pilot was broadcast.4 The series has been credited with renewing the &quot;cop genre&quot; by moving the story from a &quot;maverick detective&quot; to a high court judge.5
The courts sets are filmed on a purpose-built set in Hertfordshire, though the exterior scenes of the building are filmed at Aylesbury Crown Court.67 Location filming was also done at West Herts College for scenes in &quot;My Daughter, Right or Wrong&quot;8 (2006) and at The Hague for &quot;War Crimes&quot; (2007). The robes worn by Deed in the sixth series were authentic ones from Stanley Ley, a specialist legal outfitters, and cost &lt;U+00A3&gt;7,600.9
Theme music was composed for the series by Debbie Wiseman. The music, entitled &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;, was performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and is described as a &quot;stunning march-like theme that echoed throughout each of the programmes supplying pageantry to the Judge's sometimes-nefarious activities&quot;.10 It was released commercially on Wiseman's compilation album, Something Here, and as a single piece on online music retailers. Since 2005, television promotions for the series have been accompanied by the piano hook from &quot;Sinnerman&quot; by Nina Simone.
Setting and storylines
Judge John Deed is a recently-appointed High Court judge who actively seeks justice in the cases before him, while at the same time trying to rekindle an old romance with Jo Mills QC, who regularly appears in his court. The first few years of the series had a largely episodic structure, with a trial reaching its conclusion by the end of the episode. In later years the series has shifted to a more serialised format, with cases running over a number of episodes and past characters returning (such as the case brought by Diane Husley in series three).11 Later series have also had a greater focus on the personal lives of characters other than Deed, such as Jo's progressing romance in series five.
As of 2007 there have been 29 episodes; the pilot, three series of four episodes, two series of six episodes and one series of two two-part serials. All episodes are written by G.F. Newman. At the time the sixth series concluded, the future of the series was in doubt; the BBC had announced an intention to use Martin Shaw in a range of new projects and it was apparent that the one-off adaption of Alan Hunter's Inspector Gently novels (starring Shaw as the eponymous inspector) would be commissioned for a full series.12 Jenny Seagrove later clarified the situation, stating that the producers wanted to continue but she and Shaw were &quot;taking a sabbatical&quot; until the formula of the series was changed, implying that its future lay in the multi-part format introduced in series six.13 The six years the series has been broadcast make it the longest-running BBC legal drama.14
Characters
 Judge Sir John Deed (played by Martin Shaw) is a former QC and from a working-class family, who constantly struggles against an establishment that tries to pressure him into what he perceives is the wrong decision in cases. Often appearing as counsel in his court is Jo Mills (played by Jenny Seagrove), a barrister and Deed's former girlfriend.
Due to his unorthodox actions, he is often hampered in his pursuit of justice by several more conventional-minded characters, including his ex-wife, barrister Georgina &quot;George&quot; Channing (played by Caroline Langrishe) and her father Sir Joseph Channing (played by Sir Donald Sinden), Sir Monty Everard (played by Simon Ward), Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Department (LCD, later Department of Constitutional Affairs) Sir Ian Rochester (played by Simon Chandler), and later the Home Secretary Neil Haughton, MP (played by Aneurin Hughes).
While Deed's colleagues from the bench are often seen opposing him when he acts against their beliefs, occasionally they have co-operated with him. This cannot be said for Rochester, whose political views always seem to clash with Deed's ways, or Haughton, who is always worried about the political consequences of Deed's actions. Both have a rather tainted view of Deed, since he had a brief affair with Sir Ian's wife, and Haughton is the current partner of George.
Other recurring characters include Deed's rebellious, activist daughter Charlie (played by Louisa Clein), who is initially a law student but later progresses to the courts, Deed's friend, police commissioner Row Colemore (played by Christopher Cazenove) and his secretary, Rita &quot;Coop&quot; Cooper (played by Barbara Thorn), who is often on hand to talk him out of his more ludicrous ideas.
Reception
Legal analysis
Judge John Deed presents a fictionalised version of the English and Welsh legal system. The British Film Institute's Screenonline notes that &quot;Almost every week, Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex-wife or defended by his on-off girlfriend (with occasionally help from his daughter)&quot;, highlighting how unlikely it would be for a real judge to have so many conflicts of interest in his court. It also notes that Deed's faults, such as his affairs with his therapist and with Fracesca Rochester, prevent him from being &quot;a completely idealised heroic figure&quot;, and the fact that because all of his family and friends practice law, he is firmly entrenched in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against.15 Deed using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in &quot;Exacting Justice&quot; has also been cited as hypocrisy in his character.16 There is a belief in some legal circles that, although Deed is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas, viewers see Deed as an aspirational character taking on a corrupt establishment.17 Despite being picked apart by legal professionals, the cast and G.F. Newman were invited to the annual dinner of the Association of Women Barristers in 2006 as part of a drive to raise the profile and attract new members to the group.18
The series' creative interpretation of the law has led to a misconception by the public of what real law is like (similar to the CSI effect); in the second Damilola Taylor trial, the residing judge warned the jury that if they copied Deed's actions in the then-recent episode &quot;One Angry Man&quot; (2006), in which Deed investigated a case and interviewed witnesses while sitting on a jury, they would &quot;simply derail the whole process&quot;.19
Critical reaction
The 2006 series caused controversy for the misguided information presented in &quot;Silent Killer&quot; (2006), which suggested a link between TETRA radio emissions and motor neurone disease. A statement was released by the TETRA Industry Group, as well as the MND Association (the latter emphasising that while there is some evidence to suggest a link, it is not a single contributory factor).2021 &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (2006) was criticised for portraying a causal link between the MMR jab and autism, and the BBC received complaints on the matter. The Editorial Complaints Unit ruled that the episode had contravened the BBC's &quot;obligation of due impartiality on matters of public controversy&quot; and that the episode would not be repeated in its original form.22 The episode was cited in From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel, an internal BBC report on impartiality in its output that was published in June 2007.2324 The report also highlighted that the name of the Westwake character bore more than a passing resemblance to that of Dr. Andrew Wakefield.
Television pundits have criticised the writing of the programme; Robert Hanks of The Independent calls the scripts &quot;often corny, even painfully so&quot;, using Monty Everard's line &quot;You'll come to regret crossing swords with me, sir!&quot; from &quot;Health Hazard&quot; (2003) as an example.25 Hanks also wrote about what he called &quot;moral oversimplification&quot; of the storylines; the same episode featured &quot;a wealthy and self-important businessman - who had already been banned from talking on a mobile phone while driving - ran over and killed a mother and her two small children while talking on his mobile phone to his mistress, to whom he was explaining that he had to take his wife to a function at - the icing on this shabby cake - Downing Street. He then legged it and subsequently faked mental illness to avoid a trial; a gambit that might have worked had Deed not cunningly threatened to send him to Broadmoor, at which point the man stood up and started protesting vociferously&quot;.26
The series has frequently been lampooned for its dialogue and unlikely scenes. Andy Hamilton calls the dialogue &quot;the funniest on TV&quot;,27 while David Mitchell selected it as his &quot;TV hell&quot; in the series TV Heaven, Telly Hell.28 Deed's &quot;swashbuckling&quot; persona has been satirised on the sketch series Dead Ringers.29 Despite the often tongue-in-cheek criticism given to the programme, the series is praised as being at its best when tackling topical issues, such as the MMR vaccine, human exposure to telephone masts and incestual relationships.30
The production style also rates highly; writing in The Guardian, Mark Lawson called the pilot &quot;Glossier and more populist than Newman's earlier work&quot;. Wry reference is made to Deed and Jo's relationship, with Lawson writing that Deed &quot;is desperate to conduct his own forensic investigation of the body fluids of the attractive defence QC&quot;.31 Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it &quot;talkative in the way television plays used to be when they had something to say. But it is notable that, in a profession famous for obfuscation, Deed uses only the most pellucid English&quot;.32 As a comparison to Newman's previous work, Simon Hattenstone wrote that is &quot;rather soft&quot; and unlikely to provoke questions in the House of Commons, like Law and Order did.33
Awards
Stephen Roach received the Award of Merit at the 2005 Guild of Television Cameramen Awards for his work on the series.34 The series was nominated in the Diversity in Drama Production category at the 2006 Screen Nation Awards, though lost to an episode of Doctors.35
Series information
Broadcast history
Judge John Deed regularly forms the backbone of the BBC One winter schedule. The pilot and first series were broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 8 p.m., with the second, third and fourth series moving to Thursday evenings (8:30 p.m. for the first two and 8 p.m. for the latter, though one episode in series three was postponed for over a month). The fifth series moved to Friday nights, and the sixth was shown two nights a week, with the first part of the story on Tuesday nights and concluding the following Thursday. This series was also the first to be simulcast on BBC HD.36 Occasionally, due to a clash with regional programming, Deed has aired at different times on BBC One Scotland; series two was delayed for sometimes over a week while series three began a half hour earlier. Series five would have a six-day delay.37
Ratings for the series peaked with its first episode at 9.1 million38 but it still regularly draws in around 6 million viewers for new episodes. The series has been shown internationally by, amongst others, Canvas (Belgium), BBC America and BBC Canada. At one time Variety reported an American remake was set to be produced for NBC, coincidentally by a producer known for a different Law &amp; Order; Michael Chernuchin was to produce the series, which would follow a federal court judge in Washington, D.C. who would preside over terrorism and civil rights cases.39 There have been no further developments since the announcement was made in 2004.
