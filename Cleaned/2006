United States Marine Corps seal
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) is a branch of the U.S. military, responsible for providing power projection from the sea,1 utilizing the mobility of the U.S. Navy to rapidly deliver combined-arms task forces to global crises. Along with the U.S. Navy, it falls under the United States Department of the Navy.
Originally organized as the Continental Marines in 1775 as naval infantry, the Marine Corps would evolve its mission with changing military doctrine and American foreign policy. Owing to the availability of Marines at sea, the Marine Corps has served in every American conflict. It attained prominence in the 20th century when its theories and practice of amphibious warfare proved prescient, and ultimately formed a cornerstone of the Pacific campaign of WWII.2 By the early 20th century, the Marine Corps would become the dominant theorist and practitioner of amphibious warfare. Its ability to rapidly respond to regional crises has made and continues to make it an important tool for American foreign policy.3
The Marine Corps, with 180,000 active and 40,000 reserve Marines as of 2005, is the second-smallest of the U.S. armed forces. Only the U.S. Coast Guard is a smaller military service than the Marine Corps. The Corps is nonetheless larger than the entire armed forces of many significant military powers; for example, it is larger than the Israeli Defense Forces.45
Mission
 The Marine Corps serves as an amphibious force in readiness. Today, it has three primary areas of responsibility, as outlined in , originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947:
The seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns
The development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces
&quot;such other duties as the President may direct.&quot;
The quoted clause, while seemingly a consequence of the President's position as Commander in Chief, is a codification of the expeditionary duties of the Marine Corps. It derives from similar language in the Congressional Acts &quot;For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps&quot; of 1834, and &quot;Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps&quot; of 1798. In 1951, the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee called the clause &quot;one of the most important statutory–and traditional–functions of the Marine Corps&quot;. It noted that the Corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its roles in the War of 1812, WWI and the Korean War, its famous actions at Tripoli and Chapultepec, and their numerous counterinsurgency and occupational duties in Central America and East Asia. These actions are not accurately described as support of naval campaigns nor as amphibious warfare. Their common thread is that they are of an expeditionary nature - using the mobility of the Navy to provide timely intervention in foreign affairs on behalf of American interests.6
In addition to its primary duties, the Marine Corps has missions in support of the White House and State Department. President Jefferson dubbed the Marine Band, &quot;the President's Own,&quot; for its role of providing music for state functions at the White House.7In addition, Marines guard presidential retreats, including Camp David,8 and the Marine unit HMX-1 provides helicopter service to the President. By authority of the 1946 Foreign Service act, Marines of the Marine Corps Security Guard provide security for American embassies, legations, and consulates at over 110 State Department posts overseas.9
Historical mission
At its founding, the Marine Corps was composed of infantry serving aboard naval vessels, responsible for the security of the ship and her crew by conducting offensive and defensive combat during boarding actions, and defending the ship's officers from mutiny. They were also responsible for manning raiding parties. The Marine Corps' role has since expanded significantly. As the importance of its original naval mission declined with changing naval warfare doctrine and the professionalization of the Naval service, the Corps adapted by focusing on what were formerly secondary missions ashore. The Advanced Base doctrine of the early 20th century codified their combatant duties ashore, outlining the use of Marines in the seizure of bases and other duties on land to support naval campaigns. The Marines would also develop tactics and techniques of amphibious assault on defended coastlines in time for use in WWII.10 Its original mission of providing shipboard security finally ended in the 1990's, when the last Marine security detachments were withdrawn from U.S. Navy ships.
Capabilities
While the Marine Corps does not employ any unique combat arms, as a force it has the unique ability to rapidly deploy a combined-arms task force anywhere in the world in days. The basic structure for all deployed units is a Marine Air-Ground Task Force(MAGTF) that integrates a ground combat component, an air component, and a combat service support component under a common command element. While the creation of joint commands under the Goldwater-Nichols Act has improved interservice coordination between the U.S. military services, the Marine Corps' ability to permanently maintain integrated multi-element task forces under a single command provides a smoother implementation of combined-arms warfare principles.11
The close integration of disparate Marine units stems from an organizational culture centered around the infantry. Every other Marine capability exists to support the infantry. Unlike many Western militaries, the Corps remained conservative against theories proclaiming the ability of new weapons to win wars independently. For example, Marine Aviation has always been focused on close air support, and remained largely uninfluenced by airpower theories proclaiming that strategic bombing could singlehandedly win wars.12
This focus on the infantry is matched with the notion that &quot;every Marine is a rifleman&quot;, emphasizing the infantry combat abilities of every Marine. All enlisted Marines receive training first and foremost as a rifleman; all officers receive training as infantry platoon commanders.13 The value of this culture has been demonstrated many times throughout history. At Wake Island, when all the Marine aircraft were shot down, their pilots continued the fight as riflemen, leading supply clerks and cooks in a final defensive effort.14
The amphibious assault techniques developed for WWII evolved with the addition of air assault and maneuver warfare doctrine, into the current &quot;Operational Maneuver from the Sea&quot; doctrine of power projection from the seas.15 The Marines are credited with the development of helicopter insertion doctrine, and were the earliest in the American military to widely adopt maneuver warfare principles, which emphasize low-level initiative and flexible execution. As a result, a large degree of initiative and autonomy is expected of junior Marines, particularly the NCOs (Corporals and Sergeants) as compared to many other military organizations. The Marine Corps pushes authority and responsibility downward to a greater degree than the other services. Flexibility of execution is implemented via an emphasis on &quot;commander's intent&quot; as a guiding principle for orders - specifying the endstate but leaving open the method of execution.16
The Marine Corps relies upon the Navy for sealift to provide its rapid deployment capabilities. In addition to basing a third of the Marine Corps Operating Forces in Japan, Marine Expeditionary Unit(MEU)'s, a smaller MAGTF, are typically stationed at sea. This allows them the ability to function as first responders to international incidents. The U.S Army now maintains light infantry units capable of rapid worldwide deployment, though they do not match the combined-arms integration of a MAGTF, nor have the logistical train that the Navy provides.17 For this reason, the Marine Corps is often assigned to non-combat missions such as the evacuation of Americans from unstable countries, and humanitarian relief of natural disasters. In larger conflicts, the Marines act as a stopgap, to get into and hold an area until larger units can be mobilized. It performed this role in WWI, the Korean War, and Operation Desert Storm, where Marines were the first significant combat units deployed from the United States and held the line until the country could mobilize for war.18
History
Origins
The United States Marine Corps traces its institutional roots to the Continental Marines of the American Revolutionary War, formed at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775. This date is celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the end of the Revolution in 1783, both the Continental Navy and Marines were disbanded. Though individual Marines were enlisted for the few American naval vessels, the organization would not be re-created until 1798. In preparation for the Naval War with France, Congress created the United States Navy and Marine Corps.19 The Marines' most famous action of this period occurred during the First Barbary War (1801–1805); William Eaton and First Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon led eight Marines and 300 Arab and European mercenaries in an attempt to capture Tripoli. Though they only reached Derna, Tripoli has been immortalized in the Marines' Hymn and the Mameluke sword carried by Marine officers.20
In the War of 1812, Marine ship detachments took part in the great frigate duels of the war, the first American victories in the conflict. Their most significant contributions came at the Battle of Bladensburg and the defense of New Orleans. At Bladensburg, they held the line after the Army and militia retreated, and although eventually overrun, inflicted heavy casualties on the British and delayed their march to Washington. At New Orleans, the Marines held the center of Gen. Andrew Jackson's defensive line. By the end of the war Marines acquired a reputation as marksmen, especially in ship to ship actions.21
After the war, the Marine Corps fell into an ill state. The third and fourth commandants were court-martialed. However, the appointment of Archibald Henderson as its fifth commandant in 1820 breathed new life into the Corps. He would go on to be the longest-serving commandant. Under his tenure, the Marine Corps took on expeditionary duties in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, Key West, West Africa, the Falkland Islands, and Sumatra. Commandant Henderson is credited with thwarting President Andrew Jackson's attempts to combine the Marine Corps with the Army.22 Instead, Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps in 1834, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy, as a sister service to the U.S. Navy.23 This would be the first of many times that Congress came to the aid of the Marines.
 When the Seminole Wars (1835) broke out, Commandant Henderson volunteered the Marines for service, leading 2 battalions to war - half the strength of the Marine Corps. A decade later, in the Mexican-American War (1846–1848), the Marines made their famed assault on Chapultepec Palace, overlooking Mexico City. The Marines were placed on guard duty at the Mexican Presidential Palace, &quot;The Halls of Montezuma&quot;. In the 1850's, the Marines would further see service in Panama and Asia, escorting Matthew Perry's East India Squadron on its historic trip to the East.24
Despite their vast service in foreign engagements, the Marine Corps played a minor role during the Civil War (1861–1865); their most important task was blockade duty. The battalion of recruits formed for the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas) performed poorly, retreating with the rest of the Union forces. The Confederate Congress authorized a marine corps of 10 companies, which played little role in the war.25
Formative years
The remainder of the 19th century was marked by declining strength and introspection about the mission of the Marine Corps. The Navy's transition from sail to steam put into question the need for Marines on naval ships. Meanwhile, Marines served as a convenient resource for interventions and landings to protect American lives and property overseas. The Marine Corps was involved in over 28 separate interventions in the 30 years from the end of the Civil War to the end of the 19th century, including China, Formosa, Japan, Nicaragua, Uruguay, Mexico, Korea, Panama, Hawaii, Egypt, Haiti, Samoa, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. They would also be called upon to stem political and labor unrest within the United States.26 During this period, war correspondent Richard Harding Davis coined the phrase &quot;The Marines have landed and have the situation well in hand&quot;. Under Commandant Jacob Zeilin's term, Marine customs and traditions took shape. The Corps adopted the Marine Corps emblem in 19 November, 1868. It was also during this time that &quot;The Marines' Hymn&quot; was first heard. Around 1883, the Marines adopted their current motto &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;.27
 During the Spanish-American War (1898), Marines led U.S. forces ashore in the Philippines, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, demonstrating their readiness for deployment. At Guant&lt;U+00E1&gt;namo Bay, Cuba, Marines seized an advanced naval base that remains in use today. Between 1899 and 1916, the Marine Corps continued its record of participation in foreign expeditions, including the Philippine Insurrection, the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901), Panama, the Cuban Pacifications, Veracruz, Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Nicaragua. In 1900's and 1910's, the seizure of advance naval bases entered Marine Corps doctrine with the formation of the Marine Corps Advanced Base School and the Advance Base Force, the prototype of the Fleet Marine Force.28
Throughout the first half of the 20th century, before and after World War I, the Marines saw action throughout Central America, including Haiti and Nicaragua. These actions became known as &quot;The Banana Wars&quot;, and the experiences gained in counter-insurgency and guerrilla operations during this period were consolidated into the Small Wars Manual.29
World War I
 In World War I, battle-tested, veteran Marines served a central role in the U.S. entry into the conflict. Unlike the U.S. and British armies, the Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and NCO's with battle experience, and experienced a relatively smaller expansion. Here, the Marines fought their celebrated battle at Belleau Wood, then the largest in the history of the Corps; it created the Marines' reputation in modern history. Rallying under the battle cries of &quot;Retreat? Hell, we just got here!&quot; (Captain Lloyd Williams) and &quot;Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?&quot; (GySgt. Dan Daly), the Marines drove German forces from the area. While its previous expeditionary experiences had not earned it much acclaim in the Western world, the Marines' fierceness and toughness earned them the respect of the Germans, who rated them of storm-trooper quality. Though Marines and American media reported that Germans had nicknamed them &quot;Teufel Hunden&quot; or &quot;Devil Dogs&quot;, there is no evidence of this in German records. Nevertheless, the name stuck.30 The Marine Corps had entered the war with 511 officers and 13,214 enlisted personnel and, by November 11, 1918, had reached a strength of 2,400 officers and 70,000 men.31
Between the World Wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Commandant John A. Lejeune, another beloved commandant. Under his leadership, the Marine Corps presciently studied and developed amphibious techniques that would be of great use in WWII. Many officers, including LtCol Earl Hancock &quot;Pete&quot; Ellis foresaw a pacific war with Japan and took preparations for such a conflict. While stationed in China, then LtCol. Victor H. Krulak observed Japanese amphibious techniques in 1937. Through 1941, as the prospect of war grew, the Marine Corps pushed urgently for joint amphibious exercises, and acquired amphibious equipment such as the Higgins boat which would prove of great use in the upcoming conflict.32
World War II
In World War II, the Marines played a central role in the Pacific War; the Corps expanded from two brigades to two corps with six divisions, and five air wings with 132 squadrons. In addition, 20 Defense Battalions and a Parachute Battalion were set up.33 The battles of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between U.S. Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army.
 During the battle of Iwo Jima, photographer Joe Rosenthal took the famous photo Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima of five Marines and one Navy corpsman raising the American flag on Mt. Suribachi. Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, who had come ashore earlier that day to observe the progress of the troops, said of the flag raising on Iwo Jima, &quot;...the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years.&quot; The acts of the Marines during the war added to their already significant popular reputation, and the USMC War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia was dedicated in 1954. By the war&lt;U+2019&gt;s end, the Corps had grown to include six divisions, five air wings and supporting troops totaling about 485,000 Marines. Nearly 87,000 Marines were killed or wounded during WWII and 82 received the Medal of Honor.34
Despite Secretary Forrestal's prediction, the Corps faced an immediate institutional crisis following the war. Army generals pushing for a strengthened and reorganized defense establishment also attempted to fold the Marine mission and assets into the Navy and Army. Drawing on hastily assembled Congressional support, the Marine Corps rebuffed such efforts to legislatively dismantle the Corps, resulting in statutory protection of the Marine Corps in the National Security Act of 1947.35 Shortly after, in 1952, the Douglas-Manfield Bill afforded the Commandant an equal voice with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on matters relating to the Marines, and established the structure of three divisions and air wings that remains today. This allowed the Corps to permanently maintain a division and air wing in the Far East and participate in various small wars in Southeast Asia - in the Tachen Islands, Taiwan, Laos, Thailand, and South Vietnam.36
Korean War
. The Korean War (1950 - 1953) saw the hastily formed Provisional Marine Brigade holding the defensive line at the Pusan Perimeter. To execute a flanking maneuver, General Douglas McArthur called on Marine air and ground forces to make an amphibious landing at Inchon. The successful landing resulted in the collapse of North Korean lines and the pursuit of North Korean forces north near the Yalu River until the entrance of the People's Republic of China into the war. Chinese troops surrounded, surprised and overwhelmed the overextended and outnumbered American forces. However, unlike the Eighth Army, which retreated in disarray, the 1st Marine Division regrouped and inflicted heavy casualties during their fighting withdrawal to the coast. Now known as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, it entered Marine lore as an example of toughness and resolve. Marines would continue a battle of attrition around the 38th Parallel until the 1953 armistice37 The Korean War saw the Marine Corps expand from 75,000 regulars to a force, by the end of the conflict in 1953, of 261,000 Marines, most of whom were reservists. 30,544 Marines were killed or wounded during the war and 42 were awarded the Medal of Honor.38
Vietnam War
  The Marines also played an important role in the Vietnam War at battles such as Da Nang, Hu&lt;U+00E9&gt; City, and Khe Sanh. The Marines operated in the northern I Corps regions of South Vietnam and fought both a constant guerilla war against the NLF and an off and on conventional war against NVA regulars. Marines also conducted the less well-known Combined Action Program that implemented unconventional techniques for counter insurgency warfare. The Marine presence was withdrawn in 1971, but returned briefly in 1975 to evacuate Saigon and attempt to rescue the crew of the Mayag&lt;U+00FC&gt;ez.39 Vietnam was the longest war for the Marine Corps; at its end 13,091 Marines were killed in action and 51,392 wounded, and 57 Medals of Honor were awarded.4041 Due to rotation plolicies, more Marines served in Vietnam than WWII.42
Returning from Vietnam, the Marine Corps hit one of the lowest points in its history with high rates of courts-martial, non-judicial punishments, unauthorized absences, and outright desertions. The re-making of the Marine Corps began in the late 1970s when policies for discharging inadequate Marines were relaxed, leading to the removal of the worst performing ones. Once the quality of new recruits started to improve, the Marine Corps began reforming its NCO corps, a vital element in the functioning of the Marine Corps.43
After Vietnam, the Marines resumed their expeditionary role, participating in Operation Urgent Fury and Operation Just Cause. On October 23, 1983, the Marine headquarters building in Beirut, Lebanon was bombed, causing the highest peacetime losses to the Corps in its history (220 Marines and 21 other service members of the 24th MAU were killed) and leading to the American withdrawal from Lebanon. During the Persian Gulf War (1990–1991), Marine task forces formed the initial core for Desert Shield, while U.S. and Coalition troops mobilized, and later liberated Kuwait in Operation Desert Storm.44 U.S. Marines participated in combat operations in Somalia (1992–1995) during Operations Restore Hope, Restore Hope II, and United Shield to provide humanitarian relief.45
Global War on Terror
 Marines of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit were the first conventional forces into Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in November of 2001. Since then Marine battalions and squadrons have been rotating through, engaging leftover Taliban and Al Queda forces and helping to rebuild the war torn country.
Most recently, the Marines have served prominently in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I MEF along with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.46 During the occupation of Iraq, Marines spearheaded both assaults on the city of Fallujah in April and November 2004.47
Organization
The Department of the Navy, lead by the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), administers both the Marine Corps and the Navy. The most senior Marine officer is the Commandant of the Marine Corps, responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Marine Corps so that it is ready for operation under the command of the Unified Combatant Commanders. The Marine Corps is organized into four principal subdivisions: Headquarters Marine Corps, the Operating Forces, the Supporting Establishment, and the Marine Forces Reserve.
The Operating Forces are further subdivided into three categories: Marine Corps Forces (MARFOR) assigned to unified commands, Marine Corps Security Forces guarding naval installations, and Marine Corps Security Guard detachments at American embassies. Under the &quot;Forces for Unified Commands&quot; memo, Marine Corps Forces are assigned to each of the regional unified commands at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense and with the approval of the President. Since 1991, the Marine Corps has maintained component headquarters at each of the regional unified combatant commands.48 Marine Corps Forces are further divided into Marine Forces Command (MARFORCOM) and Marine Forces Pacific (MARFORPAC), each headed by a Lieutenant General. MARFORCOM has operational control of the II Marine Expeditionary Force; MARFORPAC has operational control of the I Marine Expeditionary Force and the III Marine Expeditionary Force.49
The Supporting Establishment includes Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC), Marine Corps Recruit Depots, Marine Corps Logistics Command, Marine bases and air stations, Recruiting Command, and the Marine Band.
Relationship with other services
Since the Marine Corps' combat capabilities overlap those of the U.S. Army, the latter has historically viewed the Corps as encroaching on the Army's capabilities and competing for money, missions, and fame. The attitude dates back to the founding of the Colonial Marines, when General George Washington refused to allow the initial Marine battalions to be drawn from among his army. Most significantly, in the aftermath of WWII, Army efforts to restructure the American defense establishment included the dissolution of the Marine Corps and the folding of its capabilities into the other services. Leading this movement were such prominent Army officers as General Dwight Eisenhower and Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall.50
The Marine Corps is a partner service with the U.S. Navy under the Department of the Navy. Both the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commandant of the Marine Corps, heads of their respective services, report directly to the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV), a civilian who heads the Department of the Navy. As a result, the Navy and Marine Corps have a close relationship, more so than with other branches of the United States Military. Whitepapers and promotional literature of the 20th century have commonly used the phrase &quot;Navy-Marine Corps Team&quot;.51 52 This relationship stems from the Navy providing transport, logistical, and combat support to put Marine units into the fight. Conversely, the Marine Corps is responsible for conducting land operations to support Naval campaigns, including the seizure of naval and air bases.
The Marine Corps cooperates with the Navy on many institutional support services. The Corps receives a significant portion of its officers from the United States Naval Academy and Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC), which are partially staffed by Marines. Marine Corps Drill Instructors contribute to training Naval officers in Officer Candidate School. Marine aviators are trained in the Naval Aviation training pipeline, and utilize Naval weapons and test pilot schools. Navy aircraft carriers deploy with a Marine Hornet squadron alongside Navy squadrons. The Navy's Blue Angels flight demonstration team includes at least one Marine pilot and is supported by a Marines C-130 Hercules aircraft.53
Since the Marines do not train chaplains or medical personnel, officers and enlisted sailors from the Navy fill these roles. Some of these sailors, particularly Hospital Corpsmen, generally wear Marine uniforms emblazoned with Navy insignia and markings in order to be noticeably distinct to compatriots but indistinguishable to enemies. The Marines also operate a network security team in conjunction with the Navy. Marine Corps Medal of Honor recipients wear the Navy variant of the award. Marines also may be awarded the Navy Cross.54
Air-ground task forces
Today, the basic framework for deployable Marine units is the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), a flexible structure of varying size. A MAGTF integrates a ground combat element (GCE), a air combat element (ACE), and and a combat service support element (CSSE) under a common command element (CE). A MAGTF can operate independently or as part of a larger coalition. It is a temporary organization formed for a specific mission and dissolved after completion of that mission. The MAGTF structure reflects a strong tradition in the Corps towards self-sufficiency and a commitment to combined arms, both essential assets to an expeditionary force often called upon to act independently in discrete, time-sensitive situations. The history of the Marine Corps as well has led to a wariness towards overreliance on its sister services, and towards joint operations in general.55
A MAGTF varies in size from the smallest, a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), based around a reinforced infantry battalion and a composite squadron, up to the largest, a Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), which ties together a Division, an Air Wing, and a Logistics Group under a MEF Headquarters Group. There are usually three MEUs assigned to each of the U.S. Navy Atlantic and Pacific Fleets, with a seventh MEU based on Okinawa. While one MEU is on deployment, one MEU is training to deploy and one is standing down, resting its Marines, and refitting. Each MEU is rated as capable of performing special operations.56
The three Marine Expeditionary Forces are:
I Marine Expeditionary Force located at Camp Pendleton, California
II Marine Expeditionary Force located at Camp Lejuene, North Carolina
III Marine Expeditionary Force located at Camp Courtney, Okinawa, Japan
Special warfare
Although the notion of a Marine special warfare contribution to the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) was considered as early as the founding of USSOCom in the 1980's, it was resisted by the Marine Corps. Then Commandant Paul X. Kelley expressed the popular belief that Marines should support Marines, and that the Corps should not fund a special warfare capability that would not support Marine operations.57 However, resistance from within the Marine Corps dissipated when Marine leaders watched the Corp's &quot;crown jewels&quot; - the 15th and 26th MEU (Special Operations Capable) (MEU(SOC)s) sit on the sidelines during the early stages of Operation Enduring Freedom while other special warfare units lead the way.58 After a three-year development period, the Marine Corps agreed in 2006 to supply a 2,600 - strong unit, Marine Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC), which would answer directly to USSOCOM. 59
Personnel
Commandants
 The Commandant of the Marine Corps is the highest-ranking officer of the Marine Corps, though he may not be the senior officer in time and grade. He is the symbolic and functional head of the Corps, and holds a position of very high esteem among Marines. The commandant has the US Code Title 10 responsibility to man, train, and equip the Marine Corps. He does not serve as a direct battlefield commander. The Commandant is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reports to the Secretary of the Navy.60
The current and 33rd Commandant of the Marine Corps is General Michael W. Hagee, who assumed the command in January of 2003. As of October 2005, Marine Generals Peter Pace (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) and James L. Jones (Commander of the United States European Command; NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe; and a former commandant of the Marine Corps) are senior in time and grade to the commandant.61 President Bush has nominated LtGen. James T. Conway to succeed Hagee as the 34th Commandant of the Marine Corps. Conway is currently the JCS Director of Operations (J-3).62 The nomination was confirmed by the Senate on August 2, 2006. Before assuming his new post, Conway will be promoted to General63
Rank structure
As in the rest of the U.S. military, ranks fall into one of three categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, and enlisted, in decreasing order of authority. To standardize compensation, each rank is assigned a pay grade. The following tables list the rank, abbreviation, paygrade, and insignia of each rank.64
Commissioned Officers
Commissioned Officers are distinguished from other officers by their commission, which is the formal written authority, issued in the name of the President of the United States, that confers the rank and authority of a Marine Officer. Commissioned officers carry the &quot;special trust and confidence&quot; of the President of the United States. Commissioned officer ranks are further subdivided into Generals, field-grade officers, and company-grade officers.65
Warrant Officers
Warrant Officers provide leadership and skills in specialized fields. Unlike most other militaries, the American military confers commissions on its Warrant Officers, though they are generally not responsible for leadership outside of their specialty. Warrant officers come primarily from the senior Non-Commissioned Officer ranks.
A Chief Warrant Officer, CWO2-CWO5, serving in the MOS 0306 &quot;Infantry Weapons Officer&quot; carries a special title, &quot;Marine Gunner&quot; (not a rank). A Marine Gunner replaces the Chief Warrant Officer insignia on the left collar with a bursting bomb insignia. Other warrant officers are sometimes informally also referred to as &quot;Gunner&quot; but this usage is not correct.

Enlisted
Enlisted Marines with paygrades of E-4 and E-5 are considered non-commissioned officers (NCOs) while those at E-6 and higher are considered Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs). The E-8 and E-9 levels each have two ranks per pay grade, each with different responsibilities. Gunnery Sergeants (E-7) indicate on their annual evaluations, called &quot;fitness reports&quot;, or &quot;fitreps&quot; for short, their preferred promotional track: Master Sergeant or First Sergeant. The First Sergeant and Sergeant Major ranks are command-oriented, with Marines of these ranks serving as the senior enlisted Marines in a unit, charged to assist the commanding officer in matter of discipline, administration and the morale and welfare of the unit. Master Sergeants and Master Gunnery Sergeants provide technical leadership as occupational specialists in their specific MOS. First Sergeants typically serve as the senior enlisted Marine in a company, battery or other unit at similar echelon, while Sergeants Major serve the same role in battalions, squadrons or larger units. The Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is a rank conferred on the senior enlisted Marine of the entire Marine Corps, personally selected by the Commandant of the Marine Corps.
Forms of address
Marines address all enlisted personnel by rank, and all Commissioned officers with &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma'am&quot;. Warrant Officers, regardless of rank, are addressed as &quot;Warrant Officer&quot; or &quot;Gunner&quot;, although this latter usage is improper unless the Warrant Officer holds the Military Occupational Specialty of Infantry Weapons Officer (MOS 0306). However, during recruit training, recruits are indoctrinated to address all officers as &quot;sir&quot; and superior enlisted ranks by their rank and last name. Unlike the Army, ranks containing &quot;Sergeant&quot; are always addressed by their full rank and never shortened to simply &quot;Sergeant&quot;
Informally, some enlisted ranks have commonly used nicknames, though they are not official and technically improper. For instance, a Master Sergeant is commonly called &quot;Top,&quot; and a Master Gunnery Sergeant is &quot;Master Guns&quot; or &quot;Master Gunny.&quot; A First Sergeant is always referred to by his/her proper rank. A Gunnery Sergeant is typically called &quot;Gunny,&quot; and (much less often) &quot;Guns.&quot; Likewise, Lance Corporals are often referred to (derisively) as &quot;Lance Coolies&quot;, &quot;Lance Coconuts&quot;, &quot;Lance Criminals&quot; or some other derivative. They are not usually called by rank due to their status as &quot;non-NCOs&quot;, or &quot;non-rates.&quot; The rank of Sergeant is never referred to as &quot;Sarge.&quot;66
Initial training
Officers
Every year, approximately 1600 new Marine officers are commissioned, and 38,000 recruits accepted and trained.67 Commissioned officers are commissioned mainly through one of three sources: Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), Officer Candidate School (OCS) – including the Platoon Leaders Class (PLC) and Officer Candidates Class(OCC) – or the United States Naval Academy (USNA).
Following commissioning, all Marine commissioned officers, regardless of accession route or further training requirements, attend The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. There, they spend six months learning to command a rifle platoon. The Basic School, for second lieutenants and warrant officers learning the art of infantry and combined arms warfare, is an example of the Corps' approach to furthering the concept that &quot;Every Marine is a rifleman.&quot;68
Enlisted
Enlisted Marines attend boot camp, at either Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) San Diego or Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, just outside Beaufort, South Carolina. Women only attend the Parris Island depot, in the Fourth Recruit Training Battalion, while males who train at Parris Island comprise the First through Third Battalions. The Mississippi River serves as the dividing line which delineates who will be trained where (with some minor exceptions), based on what recruiting district the enlistee was recruited from. Marine recruit training is the longest among the American services;it is 13 weeks long, as compared to the Army's 8 to 9 weeks.
Enlisted Marines then attend School of Infantry training at Camp Geiger or Camp Pendleton, generally based upon where the Marine received their recruit training. Infantry Marines begin their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) training immediately with the Infantry Training Battalion (ITB), while all other Marines train with the Marine Combat Training (MCT) Battalion for 22 days, learning common infantry skills, before continuing on to their MOS schools.69
Uniforms
   Uniforms serve to distinguish Marines from members of other services and militaries. The Marine Corps has the most stable and hence most recognizable uniforms in the American military; the Blue Dress dates back to the early 19th century70 and the service uniform to the early 20th century. The Marines have three main uniforms: Dress, Service, and Utility.
The Marine Corps Dress uniform is the most elaborate, worn for formal or ceremonial occasions. There are three different forms of the Dress uniform. The most common is the Blue Dress Uniform. There is also a &quot;Blue-White&quot; Dress for summer, and Evening Dress for formal (white tie) occasions.
The Blue Dress uniform, often seen in recruiting advertisements, is also often called &quot;Dress Blues&quot; or simply &quot;Blues&quot;. It is equivalent in composition and use to black tie, worn at ceremonial events. It consists of a long-sleeved midnight blue coat with a standing collar, white barracks cover, plain white shirt, sky blue trousers with white web belt or suspenders, white gloves, and black shoes and socks. The uniform may also be worn with a khaki long- or short-sleeved shirt in place of the coat. The Mameluke Sword (for officers) or NCO's sword may be worn as prescribed. NCO's, SNCO's, and Officers wear a blood stripe on their trousers.71
The Service Uniform is the typical uniform for day to day wear in an office setting and is the most commonly worn. Consisting of olive green and khaki colors, it is commonly referred to as &quot;Greens&quot;. It is roughly equivalent in function and composition to a business suit. It consists of a green coat, green trousers with khaki web belt, khaki longsleeve shirt, khaki tie, tie clasp, and black shoes. Females wear a green necktab in place of the tie, pumps instead of shoes, and have the option of wearing a skirt instead of slacks. Marines may wear a soft garrison cap (sometimes nicknamed &quot;piss cutter&quot;), or a hard framed hat, which differs in design between females and males.72
The Utility Uniform is intended for wear in the field or for working parties, and consists of camouflage blouse and trousers, tan suede boots, and green undershirt. It is rendered in MARPAT digital camouflage that breaks up the wearer's shape, and also serves to distinguish Marine uniforms from those of other services. There are two approved varieties of MARPAT, woodland (green/brown/black) and desert (tan/brown/grey). In garrison, during the summer months, the sleeves of the blouse are tightly folded up to the biceps, exposing the lighter inside layer, and forming a neat cuff to present a crisper appearance to the otherwise formless uniform. In Haiti, the practice earned them the nickname &quot;whitesleeves&quot;.73
The approved headwear for this uniform is the utility cover, an eight-pointed brimmed hat that is worn &quot;blocked&quot;, that is, creased and peaked. In the field, a boonie cover is also authorized. Since the introduction of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program(MCMAP), Marines have the option of substituting a color-coded rigger's belt for their web belt, indicating their level of proficiency in MCMAP. Unlike the Dress and Service uniforms, utilities are not permitted for off-duty wear. Though exceptions are made for essential commuting tasks, e.g. picking up children from daycare or purchasing gas, the wear of utilities in public is otherwise prohibited.74
Culture
As in any military organization, the official and unofficial traditions of the Marine Corps serve to reinforce camaraderie and set the service apart from others. The Corps' embracement of its rich culture and history is cited as a reason for its high esprit de corps.75
Official traditions and customs
The Marine motto &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; means &quot;Always faithful&quot; in Latin. This motto often appears in the shortened form &quot;Semper Fi&quot;. It is also the name of the official march of the Corps, composed by John Phillip Sousa. It was adopted in 1883, before which, the traditional mottos were &quot;Fortitudine&quot; (With Fortitude); By Sea and by Land, a translation of the Royal Marines' Per Mare, Per Terram; and To the Shores of Tripoli.76
 The Marine Corps emblem is the Eagle, Globe and Anchor, often shortented to the &quot;Globe and Anchor&quot;, or EGA. Adopted in its present form in 1868, it derives partially from ornaments worn by the Continental Marines and the British Royal Marines, and is usually topped with a ribbon reading &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;. The eagle stands for a proud country, the globe signifies global service, and the fouled anchor signifies maritime traditions. The eagle is a crested eagle found worldwide, not the bald eagle that appears in other American symbols and is native to North America. The eagle is standing on the western hemisphere and is a holding a scroll with the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis, on it. It is inscribed with gold letters, &lt;U+201C&gt;Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps.77
The Marine Corps seal was designated by General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., and consists of the Marine emblem in bronze, the beak holding a ribbon reading &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot;, on a scarlet and blue background with gold trim. On the seal, however, a bald eagle appears in place of the crested eagle78. The blue signifies naval ties, the scarlet and gold are the official Marine Corps colors. They appear ubiquitously in the Marine Corps, particularly on signage. They also form the base colors of the flag of the United States Marine Corps.79
Two styles of swords are worn by Marines. The Marine Corps officers' sword is a Mameluke sword, similar to the Persian shamshir presented to Lt. Presley O'Bannon after the Battle of Derna during the First Barbary War. After its adoption in 1825 and initial distribution in 1826, Mameluke swords have been worn by Marine officers ever since, except during the period 1859-1875, when they were required to wear the Army's Model 1850 foot officers' sword. Since 1859, Noncommissioned officers have worn a different style of sword, similar to the U.S. Army's foot officers' sword of the Civil War, making Marine NCOs along with U.S. Cavalry NCOs the only enlisted service members in the U.S. Armed Forces authorized to carry a sword.80
The Marine Corps Birthday is celebrated every year on the 10th of November. The celebrations were formalized by Commandant Lemuel C. Shepherd in 1952, outlining the cake ceremony, which would enter the Marine Drill Manual in 1956. By tradition, the first slice of cake is given to the oldest Marine present, and the second to the youngest Marine present. The celebration also includes a reading of Marine Corps Order 47, Commandant Lejeune's Birthday Message.81
Unofficial traditions and customs
 Marines have several generic nicknames, mildly derogatory when used by outsiders but complimentary when used by Marines themselves. They include &quot;jarhead&quot; (it was said their hats on their uniform made them look like mason jars, or that the regulation &quot;high and tight&quot; haircut gave the appearance of a jar-lid), &quot;gyrene&quot; (perhaps a combination of &quot;G.I.&quot; and &quot;Marine&quot;), &quot;leatherneck&quot;, referring to the leather collar that was a part of the Marine uniform during the Revolutionary War period, and &quot;Devil Dog&quot; (&quot;Teufelhunden&quot;, a corruption of the German Teufelshund, on posters and in print) after the Battle of Belleau Wood. The bulldog has been closely associated with the Marine Corps.82
A spirited cry, &quot;Ooh-rah!&quot;, is common among Marines, being similar in function and purpose to the Army's &quot;Hooah&quot; cry. &quot;Ooh-rah!&quot; is usually either a reply in the affirmative to a question, an acknowledgment of an order, an expression of enthusiasm (real or false), or a greeting. Usage of the term appears to have begun sometime after the second World War and became more firmly established after the Korean War. There is little agreement or authoritative documentation on where, or why, the practice originated. Apocryphal stories have arisen regarding the origin of the term, including imitations of submarine alarm klaxons, air raid sirens and modifications by English speakers of the word &quot;kill&quot; in languages such as Turkish and Russian. Another theory, (commonly held although there is no firm data pointing toward it), is that &quot;Oorah!&quot; is based off the British cheer &quot;Hurrah!&quot;.83 &quot;Semper Fi, Mac&quot;, was the common and preferred form of greeting in times past. This term is more than a &quot;spirited cry&quot; or a guttural sound. It was a proclamation of the Marine Corps Motto and a welcome greeting to the ears of those being greeted. It fostered a tie among the brethren who fought in the bloody fields of the Pacific Island hopping campaign and all around the world.84
Former Marines
Marines and those familiar with Marine Corps tradition will often object to the use of the term &quot;ex-Marine&quot; because Marines are inculcated with the ethos &quot;Once a Marine, always a Marine.&quot;
Former Marine refers to an individual that completed their service and has received an honorable or general discharge from the service. Marines who have retired are commonly called &quot;retired Marines&quot;, &quot;Sir/Ma'am&quot; out of respect, &quot;Marine&quot;, which they still are, or according to the &quot;Commandant's White letters&quot; from Commandant General Gray until present, by their earned rank.85
Martial arts program
In 2001, the Marine Corps initiated an internally designed martial arts program, called Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, or MCMAP for short. The idea was borrowed from the South Korean Marines, who train in martial arts and who, during the Vietnam War, were widely rumored to all hold black belts. Due to an expectation that urban and police-type peacekeeping missions would become more common in the 21st century, placing Marines in even closer contact with unarmed civilians, MCMAP was implemented to provide Marines with a larger and more versatile set of less-than-lethal options for controlling hostile, but unarmed individuals. It is also a stated aim of the program to instill and maintain the &quot;Warrior Ethos&quot; within Marines.86
The Marine Corps Martial Arts program is an eclectic mix of different styles of martial arts. MCMAP consists of boxing movements, joint locking techniques, opponent weight transfer (Jujutsu), ground grappling (mostly wrestling), bayonet, knife and baton fighting, noncompliance joint manipulations, and blood restriction chokes.
Marines begin MCMAP training in boot camp. There are 5 levels of MCMAP, signified by the color of a riggers belt. The colors from the lowest to the highest levels; Tan, Grey, Green, Brown, and Black. A minimum level of achievement is set for each rank level, including officers. Recruits and junior officers must earn a tan belt in initial training before being allowed to graduate. After entering the Fleet Marine Forces (FMF), Marines are allowed to progress further in MCMAP. Tan and Grey belts are considered the foundation of the movements in MCMAP, with succeeding belts building on those basic techniques. When a Marine reaches the level of Green belt, he has the opportunity to become an instructor or instructor trainer. This is represented by a tan stripe to the left of the buckle. At the brown belt level, a Marine must be at a minimum an instructor in MCMAP. The highest level in belts is the black belt which has 6 degrees indicated by red stripes to the right of the buckle.87
Equipment
Infantry weapons
 The basic infantry weapon of the Marine Corps is the M16 assault rifle. Suppression fire is provided by the M249 SAW and M240G machine guns at the fireteam, and company levels, respectively. In addition, indirect fire is provided by the M203 grenade launcher in fireteams, M224 60 mm mortar in companies, and M252 81 mm mortar in battalions. The M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun and MK19 Automatic Grenade Launcher (40 mm) are available for use by dismounted infantry, though they are more commonly vehicle-mounted. Precision fires are provided by the M14 designated marksman rifle and M40A3 Sniper Rifle.88
The Marine Corps utilizes a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an offensive and defensive anti-armor capability. The SMAW and AT4 Anti-Tank Missile are unguided rockets that can destroy armor and fixed defenses (e.g. bunkers) at ranges up to 500 meters. The Predator SRAW, FGM-148 Javelin, BGM-71 TOW are guided anti-tank missiles. All three can utilize top-attack profiles to avoid heavy frontal armor. The Predator is a short-range fire-and-forget weapon; the Javelin and TOW are heavier missiles effective past 2000 meters that give infantry an offensive capability against armor.89
Ground vehicles
 The Corps operates the same High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank as the U.S. Army. However, for its specific needs, the Corps has a number of unique vehicles. The LAV 25 is a dedicated wheeled armored personnel carrier used to provide strategic mobility.90 Amphibious capability is provided by the AAV-7A1 Amphibious Assault Vehicle, an armored tractor that doubles as an armored personnel carrier. Somewhat dated, it will shortly replaced by the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, a markedly faster tractor that incorporates superior armor and weaponry.
Prior to 2005, the Marines operated exclusively tube artillery – the M198 155 mm howitzer, now being replaced by the M777 155 mm howitzer. In 2005, the Corps expanded its artillery composition to include the High Mobility Artillery rocket system (HIMARS), a truck-mounted rocket artillery system. Both are capable of firing guided munitions.91
Aircraft
 The organic aviation capability of the Marine Corps is essential to its mission. The Corps operates both rotary and fixed wing aircraft to provide transport and close air support.
The Marine light helicopter squadron is a composite squadron of AH-1W Super Cobras and UH-1N Hueys, as the airframes have over 80% commonality. These provide attack and light transport capabilities.92 Medium squadrons fly the CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53D Sea Stallion transport helicopters, and are converting to the V-22 Osprey, a tiltrotor aircraft with superior range and speed. Heavy lift is provided by the CH-53E Super Stallion.93
Marine attack aviation flies the AV-8 Harrier II, and the single-seat and dual-seat versions of the F/A-18 Hornet. The AV-8 Harrier II is a VTOL aircraft that can operate from amphibious assault ships. The F/A-18 can only be flown from land or aircraft carriers. Both are slated to be replaced by the F-35B.94
In addition, the Corps operates organic electronic warfare and aerial refueling assets in the EA-6B Prowler and KC-130 Hercules. The Hercules doubles as a tactical transport aircraft. Since the Prowler is the only active tactical electronic warfare aircraft left in the U.S. inventory, it has been labeled a &quot;national asset&quot; and frequently borrowed to assist in any American combat action, not just Marine operations.95 The Marines also operate the RQ-2 Pioneer UAV for tactical reconnaissance.96
Marine bases and stations
The Marine Corps operates 15 major bases, 10 of which host operating forces.97 Marine Corps bases are concentrated around the location of the Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEF), though reserve units are scattered throughout the United States. The principal bases are Camp Pendleton on the West coast, home to I MEF; Camp Lejeune on the East Coast, home to II MEF, and Camp Butler in Okinawa, Japan, home to III MEF.
Other important bases are the homes to Marine training commands. Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms in California is the Marine Corps' largest base. Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia is home to Marine Corps Combat Development Command. It is considered the &quot;Crossroads of the Marine Corps&quot;98 as most Marines will attend school at Quantico at some point - it is home to initial officer training, and the Marine Corps University, which contains the career schools Staff Non-Commissioned Officers Academy, Marine Corps War College (MCWAR), School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW), Command and Staff College (CSC), The School of MAGTF Logistics (SOML), Expeditionary Warfare School (EWS) as well as a variety of other leadership and education programs.99
Famous Marines
Many famous Americans have served in the Marine Corps. In politics, Senator Zell Miller, pundit James Carville, Reagan Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb and military analysts Anthony Zinni, Joseph Hoar, Bernard E. Trainor were Marines. Baseball Hall of Famers Tom Seaver, Ted Williams, Rod Carew, Roberto Clemente, Eddie Collins, and Bill Veeck all served in the Marines. Six astronauts, including John Glenn, Charles F. Bolden, Jr. and Fred Haise were Marine aviators. Several Marines--particularly R. Lee Ermey, who hosts the TV series Mail Call--have succeeded in the entertainment industry, amassing three Academy Awards. In addition, many films feature the U.S. Marine Corps.100
