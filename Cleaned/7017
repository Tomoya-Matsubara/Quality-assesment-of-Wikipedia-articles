 This is a list of first-round draft picks made by the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). This list concerns the first round of the &quot;NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting&quot;, which occurs every April, and is more commonly known as the NFL Draft. The Panthers joined the NFL in 1995 as the league's 29th franchise.1 Their first ever selection was Kerry Collins, a quarterback from Penn State, in the 1995 NFL Draft. The team's most-recent first-round selection was Jon Beason, a linebacker from the University of Miami, in the 2007 NFL Draft. The Panthers have never had the first overall selection; their highest draft position was second overall in 2002 when they selected Julius Peppers, a defensive end from North Carolina. The Panthers have twice selected a Miami Hurricanes player in the first round: linebacker Dan Morgan in 2001 and Beason in 2007.
Collins, the team's first ever selection, made the Pro Bowl and led the Panthers to the playoffs in only their second season of existence, but he was later released after struggling on and off the field with alcoholism. Rae Carruth began his career as a promising wide receiver,2 but he was dropped from the team after being arrested for killing his pregnant girlfriend. On more positive notes, Julius Peppers won Rookie of the Year, has been named to the Pro Bowl on several occasions, and is the centerpiece of the Panthers' defensive line.3 Dan Morgan is also a highly touted Pro Bowl linebacker, but repeated concussions have caused him to miss parts of several seasons. The Panthers drafted Jon Beason in 2007 partially to insure their defense against Morgan's absence.4
When the Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars joined the league together in 1995, both teams participated in an expansion draft, where they selected players from 30 existing NFL teams.5 This list does not include players selected in that draft.
