Quintanilla III.2 It was produced by Quintanilla III and Argentine music producer Bebu Silvetti. The song was intended to be one of three studio tracks for Selena's Live! (1993) album. Vela had wrote most of the lyrics while touring with Los Dinos in the 1992-93 period. Quintanilla III later co-wrote the song after Vela finished the lyrics. Quintanilla III only made a few adjustments to the song and began adding music notes for pre-production. &quot;No Debes Jugar&quot; was recorded in Corpus Christi, Texas at Selena's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.'s recording studio Q-Productions. After recording sessions were done, EMI Latin argued that the song should be the lead single from Live!. Before the album was released, the song was mixed by Brian &quot;Red&quot; Moore, a family friend.3
