The Irish presidential election of 2011 was the thirteenth presidential election to be held in Ireland, and the first to be contested by a record seven candidates.1 It was held on Thursday, 27 October 2011.23 The election was held to elect a successor to Mary McAleese, with the winner becoming the ninth President of Ireland. Two constitutional referendums and a by-election for a vacant D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il seat in the Dublin West constituency took place on the same day.45
After just three hours of tallying on the Friday, it became clear that Michael D. Higgins would win the election. By 5 PM the same day, his primary competitor Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Gallagher had phoned Higgins to congratulate him on his victory.6
Procedure
To qualify, candidates must:7
be a citizen of the state
be over 35 years of age
be nominated by:
At least twenty of the 226 serving members of the Oireachtas (parliament), or
At least four of the 34 county or city councils, or
Him- or herself, in the case of an incumbent or former president who has served one term.
Method and date of election
Presidential elections are conducted under the Presidential Elections Act 1993, as amended. Constitutionally, the election must be held not more than 60 days before the ending of the term of office of the incumbent, or within 60 days of the office becoming vacant.8 On 27 July the government announced that the election would be held on 27 October 2011.9 An order was made on 30 August by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government declaring 28 September to be the last day on which nominations may be received.1011 The election was conducted by means of the alternative vote (also called instant runoff voting), which is the single-winner analogue of the single transferable vote used in other Irish elections.12 Although the constitution calls the system &quot;proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote&quot;, a single-winner election cannot be proportional.13 All Irish citizens entered on the current electoral register were eligible to vote.1415 16
Voting took place between 07:00 and 22:00 (IST).17
As usual, voting began on certain offshore islands a few days before the rest of the country. On the Donegal islands of Arranmore, Gola, Inishfree, Inisbofin and Tory, voting took place on 24 October between 11:00 and 15:00 (11:00 and 19:30 on Arranmore). On 25 October, the Mayo islands of Clare Island, Inishbiggle and Inishturk went go to the polls; while the Galway islands of Inishbofin and the Aran Islands voted on 26 October between 07:00 and 22:00.18
After 15 hours of voting, ballot boxes were secured, with nationwide counting of votes due to begin the following morning after presidential votes were separated from constitutional referendum votes (which were due to be counted later).19202122
Candidates
There are seven candidates contesting the presidential election, having been selected by their parties or having received sufficient council nominations. This is the largest number of candidates to contest an Irish presidential election.23
Mary Davis, social entrepreneur, disability rights campaigner and best known as organiser of the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games in Ireland, was nominated by local Councils.24
Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Gallagher, entrepreneur, panellist on the Dragons' Den television programme and former member of the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il National Executive, was nominated by local Councils.25
Michael D. Higgins, former Minister and TD was selected by the Labour Party.26
Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland was selected by Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in, and received enough support from independent TDs to be nominated.27
Gay Mitchell, MEP and former TD was selected by Fine Gael.28
David Norris, Senator, scholar and civil rights campaigner, was nominated by local Councils.29
Dana Rosemary Scallon, former MEP, was nominated by local Councils.30
Nomination campaign
Following the general election in February 2011, and the election of the members of the 24th Seanad, only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: Fine Gael (76 TDs and 19 senators), the Labour Party (37 TDs and 13 senators) and Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il (19 TDs and 14 senators). Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in, the next largest party in the D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann, have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.
Fine Gael
Gay Mitchell, MEP for the Dublin constituency and former TD for Dublin South Central was chosen as the Fine Gael candidate at a special convention held on 9 July 2011.3132 He announced that he would be seeking the party's nomination in June 2011, having been contacted by &quot;a large number of senior figures in the party&quot;.333435 Voting was by secret ballot, with an electoral college consisting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party (TDs, Senators and MEPs) with 70% of the vote, county and city councillors (20%) and the twelve-member executive council (10%).36
Three others sought the nomination:
Pat Cox, former President of the European Parliament and former Progressive Democrats/Independent MEP.37 Early in June 2011, press reports indicated that Cox, who had stated his desire to stand as an independent candidate, was seeking to join Fine Gael to be eligible for the party's nomination. His application to join the party was accepted by Fine Gael's National Executive Committee on 14 June.3839 He launched his campaign for the Fine Gael nomination on 17 June 2011, describing it as a &quot;one-shot opportunity&quot; and that if he failed to be nominated by the party he would not stand as an independent.4041 Cox was claimed by the Irish Independent to be the preferred choice of Taoiseach Enda Kenny and the Fine Gael leadership.42
Avril Doyle, former MEP and TD. On 21 June 2011, she announced her candidacy.43 She withdrew from the contest on 7 July stating that she realised she was unlikely to receive the nomination.44
Mairead McGuinness, MEP for the East constituency, former presenter of Ear to the Ground on RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; One and former journalist with the Irish Independent. She announced her bid for the Fine Gael nomination in April 2011.45
In March 2011, Fine Gael produced a shortlist of three candidates: John Bruton, Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Kelly and Mairead McGuinness.46 Bruton, a former Taoiseach and European Union Ambassador, ruled himself out of the contest on 28 May 2011.47 Kelly, an MEP and former President of the Gaelic Athletic Association indicated on 1 June 2011 that he would not be seeking the party's nomination, and wished to continue serving in the European Parliament.48 The party approached Nobel laureate poet Seamus Heaney in late 2010, but Heaney declined to stand unless he was an agreed cross-party candidate.4950
On the announcement that Mitchell had won the nomination, the Irish Independent stated that Kenny was seen to slump and &quot;could barely contain his disappointment.&quot; When questioned by a journalist on his apparent disappointment, Kenny responded sharply &quot;Am I supposed to be going around grinning like a Cheshire Cat at everything?&quot;51
Labour Party
The Labour Party candidate is Michael D. Higgins. He was chosen jointly by the party's National Executive and the Labour Parliamentary Party at a special convention on 19 June 2011.52
The former TD and Minister, and current Labour Party president, originally indicated that he was interested in receiving the party's nomination in September 2010.535455 Like Higgins, two other candidates put their names forward in late May 2011:56
Fergus Finlay, Chief Executive of Barnardo's children's charity, announced on 9 September 2010 that he would seek the Labour Party's nomination for president.57
Kathleen O'Meara, former Senator, also put her name forward for the party nomination.58
Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il
For the first time in any presidential election, Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il is neither running a candidate nor supporting the nomination of a candidate. The decision was made at a meeting of the parliamentary party on 31 August 2011, and was in line with the recommendations of the six-person subcommittee formed by the party leader Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin to consider the matter.59
In June 2011 press reports had indicated that the party was unlikely to run a candidate both for financial reasons and also because it was unlikely that a Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il nominee could be successful.606162 In early August 2011 there was press speculation that RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; broadcaster Gay Byrne might seek a nomination. On 6 August Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin rang Byrne at his holiday home to indicate that Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il Oireachtas members would facilitate his nomination.63 Byrne indicated that he had yet to make a decision on whether to put his name forward, but said that if he did so he would not run under the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il banner but as an independent, albeit with the assistance of the party's organisation. &quot;Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il are convinced no matter who they put up will be unelectable, so they're giving me their support&quot; he told the Irish Independent.6465 &lt;U+00C9&gt;amon &lt;U+00D3&gt; Cu&lt;U+00ED&gt;v, the party's deputy leader and member of the committee tasked with deciding on their strategy for the election stated that &quot;I know of no approach to Gay Byrne... Nobody has discussed the issue with me - good, bad or indifferent.&quot;6667 On 13 August Byrne informed Martin that he would not be going forward for nomination. He stated that the idea of running had been &quot;foisted on him and he had not known anything about it and what it would involve&quot;.68 This followed unease among Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il parliamentary party Oireachtas members, with a number unhappy that a candidate was being imposed by the leadership without discussion.69
On 16 August 2011, the Irish Examiner reported that Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin had moved to pull the party out of the presidential race over the fallout from the approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected.70 On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader &lt;U+00C9&gt;amon &lt;U+00D3&gt; Cu&lt;U+00ED&gt;v told Raidi&lt;U+00F3&gt; na Gaeltachta that he believed the party should put forward a candidate.71 Several members had expressed an interest in the a party nomination:
Brian Crowley, MEP, said in The Irish Times on 29 September 2008 that he would like to stand for president in 2011.72 In July 2011 he wrote to members of the parliamentary party confirming that he wished to contest the election as the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il candidate.73 On 23 August Crowley indicated that he would not be seeking a nomination. He stated that the party leadership &quot;has demonstrated that it does not want an internal party candidate to contest the upcoming presidential election. So, with much disappointment, I do not now feel free to seek the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il nomination.&quot;74
&lt;U+00C9&gt;amon &lt;U+00D3&gt; Cu&lt;U+00ED&gt;v, TD for Galway West and former minister, expressed an interest in the office once held by his grandfather, &lt;U+00C9&gt;amon de Valera.75
Senator Mary White had announced her intention to stand for the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il nomination in 2008,
 but in May 2011 said that she would not be seeking the nomination.76
Mary Hanafin also expressed an interest in seeking the nomination.77
Following the decision by Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il not to run their own candidate, there was speculation that some party members might be prepared to nominate an independent candidate. However, on 11 September the party's chief whip, Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n &lt;U+00D3&gt; Fearghail, made it clear that individual TDs and senators would not be permitted to sign the nomination papers of independent candidates. He said that if the party decided to support a candidacy it would be done collectively.78
A meeting of the parliamentary party was held on 15 September at which the issue of the presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhr&lt;U+00E1&gt;s &lt;U+00D3&gt; Murch&lt;U+00FA&gt;, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate.79 This was widely seen as a challenge to the authority of Miche&lt;U+00E1&gt;l Martin.80 The extended meeting broke up without agreement.81 The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator &lt;U+00D3&gt; Murch&lt;U+00FA&gt; withdrew his request for a nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il members.82
Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in
At the party's Ard Comhairle meeting in Dublin in June 2011, the party's leader, Gerry Adams TD, ruled himself out as a candidate.83 He had previously expressed a wish to be elected president in time for the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.84
There had been reports in July that artist Robert Ballagh was &quot;seriously considering a run for the presidency&quot;, and had been in talks with Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in, the Socialist Party and People Before Profit Alliance.85 A Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in source confirmed there had been &quot;very informal discussions&quot;,86 However, on 25 July Ballagh ruled himself out.87
In a keynote speech at the party's Ard Fheis on 10 September Gerry Adams said that he felt that Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in should support the nomination of &quot;a candidate who is capable of winning the support of progressive and nationalist opinion... who will reflect the broad republican spirit of the Irish people at this time&quot;. He went on to state that the party's Ard Comhairle or officer board would consider the matter on 17 September.888990
On 16 September it was revealed that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, nominated to contest the election.91 With 14 TDs and three Senators, Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members to nominate a candidate for the presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness,92 securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon&lt;U+2013&gt;South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.
Independent
In order to secure a nomination, a number of non-party politicians sought the support of either 20 members of the Oireachtas or four city or county councils.
Oireachtas nominations
David Norris, a Senator since 1987 and long time civil rights campaigner who campaigned unsuccessfully in 2004 declared that he would seek a nomination in early 2010, and launched his campaign in January 2011.
93 It had initially been anticipated that he might be nominated by the Labour Party.94 A Red C poll commissioned by Paddy Power in January 2011 showed that Norris was by far the most popular choice for President with more than double the support of any of the other potential candidates.9596 On 14 March 2011 Norris formally launched his campaign to secure a nomination, stating that he had written to the chairpersons of each of the 34 county and city councils and that he would also be individually contacting the independent TDs elected to the 31st Dail.97 On 21 July Norris revealed that he had secured the support of 13 Oireachtas members for his candidacy, and was confident of securing 20.98 On 22 July two more senators announced they would back him.99 However, on 2 August, Norris publicly announced at a press conference that he was withdrawing from the presidential race.100 This followed the decision of three of his backers, the TDs John Halligan, Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle to withdraw their support following revelations that Norris had written a letter to an Israeli court asking clemency for his former partner Ezra Nawi, who was then facing criminal charges. This information was publicised by John Connolly, a pro-Israel blogger in London, on July 24th.101 Norris withdrew his candidacy on the 2 August due to the controversy.102 On 15 September, however, it was reported that Norris was seeking to re-enter the election, and was meeting independent TDs looking for their support.103 By 25 September Norris had his nomination paper signed by 18 members of the Oireachtas104 However Mattie McGrath TD indicated that he would not be signing Norris's nomination papers following a meeting with his supporters.105 This effectively ended the attempt to gain nomination through the Oireachtas,106 although Michael Lowry TD had stated that he would give Norris his final required nomination if he managed to get 19 nominations.107
Niall O'Dowd, New York based journalist and publisher. Early in June 2011, he indicated he had been approached by &quot;a cross-party group of Irish and Irish-Americans&quot; urging him to put his name forward for the contest.108 O'Dowd travelled to Ireland later in the month to meet Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il, Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in and independent TDs and senators in an attempt to gain a nomination.109110 O'Dowd withdrew from seeking a nomination on 30 June, due to the difficulty of organising a campaign and &quot;because he stopped believing he could win&quot;.111
The members of the Technical Group of independents in D&lt;U+00E1&gt;il &lt;U+00C9&gt;ireann considered nominating a candidate. Finian McGrath, the chair of the group, circulated a list of 10 possible candidates to the members during the summer of 2011.112 Although meetings were held with Dana Rosemary Scallon, Mary Davis and Tr&lt;U+00F3&gt;caire chief executive Justin Kilcullen no agreement was reached.113 Kilcullen withdrew from seeking a nomination on 14 September.114
Council nominations
A number of independent politicians sought support from local authorities, and four candidates were nominated by the resolutions of four or more councils:
Mary Davis announced on 26 May 2011 that she would be seeking a nomination.115116 She had originally stated in August 2010 that she would consider standing for the presidency if approached by a political party.117118 She subsequently decided to run as an independent, seeking nominations from four local authorities.119120121122123
Se&lt;U+00E1&gt;n Gallagher.124 In May 2011, The Sunday Business Post reported that he was likely to seek a nomination.125 The Irish Times subsequently reported that in addition to seeking the support of independents, he was approaching Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il Oireachtas members in order to run as an independent candidate, but with a &quot;semi-detached&quot; relationship with the party.126 On 13 June 2011, he began the process of looking for nominations from local authorities.127128129
David Norris. Norris approached a number of councils in June and July of 2011.130131132 On 2 August Norris announced he was withdrawing from the election.133 In September he reversed the decision, and received his first local authority nomination on 20 September.134
Dana Rosemary Scallon announced on 19 September that she would be seeking a presidential nomination. She initially attempted to gain the signatures of 20 Oireachtas members.135 However, by 21 September, she only secured the support of one TD.136 She instead began the process of seeking support from county and city councils.137
A number of councils scheduled special meetings to consider presidential nominations prior to the deadline of midday on 28 September 2011. Both David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon secured the support of a sufficient number of local authorities to become candidates in the presidential election.138139

Election campaign
The &quot;motley crew&quot; of candidates (The Washington Times) led to much attention on the campaign and election outcome from the international media.164 The Guardian described it as &quot;the most fractious presidential election campaign since the republic was founded&quot;.165
Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan of Fine Gael, attacked Martin McGuinness claiming that US multinational companies would be &quot;appalled&quot; if Martin McGuinness was elected and foreign direct investment would drop.166 This was followed by a tweet made by Government Chief Whip Paul Kehoe which claimed that McGuinness profited from the Northern Bank robbery.167 This was in response to a pledge made by McGuinness to only take the average industrial wage, if elected President. McGuinness dismissed both charges as &quot;black propoganda&quot;.168 It was reported in The Irish Times that Fine Gael's &quot;strategy of levelling strongly worded accusations at Mr McGuinness was part of a drive to motivate party voters to come out in support of Mr Mitchell in the October 27th election&quot;.169
At her formal campaign launch on 4 October, Independent Mary Davis accused Fine Gael of using polling companies to research attacks on her. She also pledged she would ask the Government to bring the office of President under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act and that she would publish an annual expenditure report for the &lt;U+00C1&gt;ras. David Norris also made a pledge to publish expenses.170 Mrs. Davis eventually accepted &quot;collective responsibility&quot; for mortgage lending decisions made after she was appointed to the board of the ICS building society.171
During the campaign, several relatives of people killed during The Troubles objected to the prospect of a former IRA member, McGuinness, becoming President.172173174175 On 10 October, McGuinness was confronted in Athlone by the son of a member of the Irish Army killed by the IRA after Don Tidey's kidnap in Ballinamore in 1983.176177 In a RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; interview that aired on October 20, Bryan Dobson noted a 1985 Hot Press interview in which McGuinness indicated that he considered the IRA volunteers at Ballinamore to be &quot;defending themselves against armed Garda&lt;U+00ED&gt; and soldiers.&quot; When Dobson then asked if it was &quot;fair to say that on this occasion you were standing over the killing of members of the Garda&lt;U+00ED&gt; and Defence Forces?&quot; McGuinness insisted that he has &quot;never done that.&quot;178 The family of Garda Detective Frank Hand, killed in 1984, accused McGuinness of misleading younger generations with a &quot;glossy campaign&quot;.179180 The husband of a mother killed by the IRA in 1981 said he doubted McGuinness' claims of ignorance about the identities of IRA killers, saying &quot;If anybody knows who did it, he does. If he is full of apologies he has never apologised to me&quot;.181
In Northern Ireland, unionists took exception to the appearance of McGuinness election posters there given that Northern Ireland citizens were not eligible to vote in this Republic of Ireland election.182 In August Sinn F&lt;U+00E9&gt;in had called for voting rights in the presidential election to be extended to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.183
Michael D. Higgins was confronted by former Tara mines workers while canvassing in Meath. The workers were upset about their pensions being cut.184 Higgins was also pursued by his past links to the Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il party, and admitted on 13 October that he had been elected chairman of the the UCG Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il university cumann in 1966.185 While at university in the United States he had, he admitted smoked marijuana.186 However, media reports said he was &quot;spared the intense grilling Miriam O'Callaghan meted out to some of the others&quot; during the Prime Time debate.187
Debates
The first broadcast debate of the campaign took place on 28 September 2011, the day that nominations closed, on RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; Radio 1's News at One programme. This was followed by a series of televised one-on-one interviews with the candidates on RT&lt;U+00C9&gt; One's evening Prime Time programme on the same day.188189 A second debate was held on The Late Late Show on 30 September; David Norris was not interviewed alone as were the other six candidates but included in the later panel debate, as he had been interviewed the previous week on the programme.190
TV3 broadcast Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate191 on 4 October. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the &quot;fairytale&quot; that he left the IRA in 1974, asking him directly: &lt;U+201C&gt;If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t; if you say you are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand &lt;U+2013&gt; how can people have confidence in your word?&lt;U+201D&gt;.192 Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims that he left the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise.193194 McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the wireless that the people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they could find a way to implicate him.195
During a debate on Today FM Gay Mitchell controversially spoke of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth, with some other candidates disagreeing with him.196 Mitchell was also not recognised by some voters,197 and criticised over remarks on suicide he made on live radio.198199
On 12 October, there was another TV debate on RT&lt;U+00C9&gt;, this time on the Prime Time programme, with the seven candidates and Miriam O'Callaghan as moderator.200201 The debate, lasting 90 minutes, took place on a Wednesday night, though Prime Time usually aired on a Tuesday and Thursday, and was announced a week in advance.202 Towards the end of the debate, Dana Rosemary Scallon read out a prepared statement towards the end of the debate, announcing that a &quot;malicious&quot; and &quot;false&quot; accusation has been made against her and her family in the United States and, while refusing to divulge any details, she said she would leave &quot;no stone unturned&quot; in her mission to track down the person or organisation responsible.203204 Scallon was visibly upset and was comforted by other candidates.205 She met with her lawyers the next day.206 David Norris expressed sorrow for Scallon and comforted her, later saying that he too had been libelled by the media and was pursuing the matter.207 Scallon told TV3 News on 14 October that a freelance journalist had told her the allegations would appear through the media.208
Gallagher's campaign suffered a severe setback on 24 October when, in the last televised debate before the election, he admitted to collecting a cheque for &lt;U+20AC&gt;5,000 from someone he described as a &quot;convicted criminal and fuel smuggler&quot;, for a Fianna F&lt;U+00E1&gt;il fundraiser event which gave access to the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen.209210 Gallagher had been the frontrunner in an opinion poll at this point.211 The donation was later revealed to be from businessman Hugh Morgan. Gallagher subsequently denied collecting a cheque from Morgan, but refused to answer questions on an illegal loan of &lt;U+20AC&gt;82,829 that he had received from one of his companies, which had also been raised in the 24 October televised debate.212 After this performance Gallagher's campaign was compared to Devon Loch's fall at the winning post in the 1956 Grand National.213 He was reported to have been left &quot;shell-shocked&quot; afterwards.214 Gallagher cancelled his planned meet-the-people visits the following day so that he could tour broadcasters and attempt to explain his behaviour.215

Result
Counting of votes began at 9:00 on 28 October. The fourth and final count was completed by 15:56 on 29 October.235
Tallies from early on the 28 October showed that Higgins was likely to receive the largest number of first preferences. Speaking at the RDS count centre, David Norris conceded and sent Higgins his congratulations, calling him &quot;a bit of a maverick like myself&quot;.236237238 A member of the Norris campaign said the number of apologies coming in from newspapers was &quot;somewhat staggering&quot;.239 Norris mentioned on radio that he had been &quot;collecting apologies in the newspapers&quot; and that they &quot;told the truth in the end&quot;.240
Fine Gael's general secretary Tom Curran called it a &quot;bad day&quot; for the party, adding &quot;From early on the electorate had the view that Gay (Mitchell) was out of the race and that it was a two person race&quot;.241 According to tallies, Mitchell received only about one in eight votes from his own constituency of Dublin South Central.242243 Mitchell performed considerably worse than Fine Gael's 1990 candidate Austin Currie which had been regarded as one of the party's most unsuccessful election campaigns.244
