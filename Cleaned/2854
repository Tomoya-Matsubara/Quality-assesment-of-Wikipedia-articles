Amphetamine, through activation of a TAAR1 trace amine receptor, increases biogenic amine and Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory excitatory neurotransmitter activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. At therapeutic doses, this causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in libido, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control.

Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain's neurotransmitter systems; these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems.cite book   author = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE   editor = Sydor A, Brown RY   title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience   year = 2009   publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical   location = New York, USA   isbn = 9780071481274   pages = 154157   edition = 2nd   chapter = Chapter 6: Widely Projecting Systems: Monoamines, Acetylcholine, and Orexin cite journal   author = Bidwell LC, McClernon FJ, Kollins SH   title = Cognitive enhancers for the treatment of ADHD   journal = Pharmacol.

Side effects
The side effects of amphetamine are varied, and the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects. Amphetamine products such as Adderall, Dexedrine, and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long-term therapeutic use. Recreational drug use#Stimulants Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses, which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons.

Tolerant individuals have been known to take as much as 5&nbsp;grams of amphetamine in a day, which is roughly 100&nbsp;times the maximum daily therapeutic dose. Symptoms of a moderate and extremely large overdose are listed below; fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma.

It is likely that FosB research will now progress into a new era  the use of FosB as a biomarker. If FosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance, then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker Figure 2. Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&nbsp;...ConclusionsFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of FosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for FosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 87,88, Cdk5 93 and NFkB 100. Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure 60,95,97,102. New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of FosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of FosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a molecular switch 34. As a consequence of our improved understanding of FosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications 119, as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions 121,122,124. Some of these proposed interventions have limitations 125 or are in their infancy 75. However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction. While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction. Sustained aerobic exercise on a regular basis also appears to be an effective treatment for amphetamine addiction; exercise therapy improves wikt:clinical clinical treatment outcomes and may be used as a combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy, which is currently the best clinical treatment available.

Consequently, FosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine-induced sex addictions, which are compulsive sexual behaviors that result from excessive amphetamine use.

Finally, periods of abstinence from sexual experience were found to be critical for enhanced Amph reward, NAc spinogenesis Pitchers et al., 2010a, and glutamate receptor trafficking Pitchers et al., 2012.

Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise#FosB neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise, especially endurance exercise e.g., marathon running, prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct supplemental treatment for amphetamine addiction.cite journal   author = Lynch WJ, Peterson AB, Sanchez V, Abel J, Smith MA   title = Exercise as a novel treatment for drug addiction: a neurobiological and stage-dependent hypothesis   journal = Neurosci Biobehav Rev   volume = 37   issue = 8   pages = 162244  date=September 2013    pmid = 23806439   pmc = 3788047   doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.06.011   quote = these data show that exercise can affect dopaminergic signaling at many different levels, which may underlie its ability to modify vulnerability during drug use initiation.

These findings suggest that exercise may magnitude-dependently prevent the development of an addicted phenotype possibly by blocking/reversing behavioral and neuro-adaptive changes that develop during and following extended access to the drug.&nbsp;... Exercise has been proposed as a treatment for drug addiction that may reduce drug craving and risk of relapse. Although few clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of exercise for preventing relapse, the few studies that have been conducted generally report a reduction in drug craving and better treatment outcomes see Table 4.&nbsp;... Taken together, these data suggest that the potential benefits of exercise during relapse, particularly for relapse to psychostimulants, may be mediated via chromatin remodeling and possibly lead to greater treatment outcomes. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions. In particular, aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the reinstatement i.e., relapse of drug-seeking, and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 dopamine receptor D2 DRD2 density in the striatum. This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density.cite journal   author = Olsen CM   title = Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions   journal = Neuropharmacology   volume = 61   issue = 7   pages = 11091122  date=December 2011    pmid = 21459101   pmc = 3139704   doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.03.010   quote = Similar to environmental enrichment, studies have found that exercise reduces self-administration and relapse to drugs of abuse Cosgrove et al., 2002; Zlebnik et al., 2010.

Interactions

Many types of substances are known to drug interaction interact with amphetamine, resulting in altered drug action or Drug metabolism metabolism of amphetamine, the interacting substance, or both.  Inhibitors of the enzymes that metabolize amphetamine i.e., CYP2D6 and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 will prolong its elimination half-life, meaning that its effects will last longer.cite web   title = Adderall XR Prescribing Information   url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s026lbl.pdf   pages = 810   publisher = Shire US Inc   work = United States Food and Drug Administration  date=December 2013   accessdate = 30 December 2013   Amphetamine also interacts with abbr MAOIs monoamine oxidase inhibitors, particularly monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines i.e., norepinephrine and dopamine; therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous.  Amphetamine will modulate the activity of most psychoactive drugs.  In particular, amphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of stimulants and antidepressants.  Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of antihypertensives and antipsychotics due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively.  In general, there is no significant interaction when consuming amphetamine with food, but the pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine, respectively.  Acidic substances reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion, and alkaline substances do the opposite.  Due to the effect pH has on absorption, amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonist H2 antihistamines, which increase gastrointestinal pH i.e., make it less acidic.
Pharmacology
Pharmacodynamics
hatnote For a simpler and less technical explanation of amphetamine's mechanism of action, see the Adderall#Mechanism of action mechanism of action section in the Adderall article.
amphetamine pharmacodynamicsAmphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by altering the use of monoamines as neuronal signals in the brain, primarily in catecholamine neurons in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain, collectively known as the mesocorticolimbic projection. The concentrations of the main neurotransmitters involved in reward circuitry and executive functioning, dopamine and norepinephrine, increase dramatically in a dose-dependent manner by amphetamine due to its effects on monoamine transporters. The reinforcing and task Salience neuroscience saliency effects of amphetamine are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway.
Amphetamine has been identified as a potent full agonist of TAAR1 trace amine-associated receptor 1 TAAR1, a nowrap Gs alpha subunit Gs-coupled and nowrap Gq alpha subunit Gq-coupled G protein-coupled receptor GPCR discovered in 2001, which is important for regulation of brain monoamines.cite web title=TA1 receptor url=http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=364 work=IUPHAR database publisher=International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology accessdate=8 December 2014 author=Maguire JJ, Davenport AP date=2 December 2014 quote=Comments:  Tyramine causes an increase in intracellular cAMP in HEK293 or COS-7 cells expressing the TA1 receptor in vitro 4,6,18.

Dextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of abbr TAAR1 trace amine-associated receptor 1 than levoamphetamine. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces greater abbr CNS central nervous system stimulation than levoamphetamine, roughly three to four times more, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects.cite journal   author= Lewin AH, Miller GM, Gilmour B   title=Trace amine-associated receptor 1 is a stereoselective binding site for compounds in the amphetamine class   journal=Bioorg.

=Dopamine=
In certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft. Amphetamine can enter the presynaptic neuron either through abbr DAT dopamine transporter or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly. As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter. Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine activates abbr TAAR1 trace amine-associated receptor 1 which, through protein kinase A PKA and protein kinase C PKC signaling, causes DAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT endocytosis internalization nowrap non-competitive reuptake inhibition, but nowrap PKC-mediated phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function dopamine wikt:efflux efflux.cite journal   author = Maguire JJ, Parker WA, Foord SM, Bonner TI, Neubig RR, Davenport AP   title = International Union of Pharmacology.

Through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels and increased dopamine release, abbr TAAR1 trace amine associated receptor 1 reduces the action potential firing rate of postsynaptic dopamine receptors, preventing a hyper-dopaminergic state.cite journal  author=Revel FG, Moreau JL, Gainetdinov RR, Bradaia A, Sotnikova TD, Mory R, Durkin S, Zbinden KG, Norcross R, Meyer CA, Metzler V, Chaboz S, Ozmen L, Trube G, Pouzet B, Bettler B, Caron MG, Wettstein JG, Hoener MC  title=TAAR1 activation modulates monoaminergic neurotransmission, preventing hyperdopaminergic and hypoglutamatergic activity  journal=Proc.

Amphetamine is also a substrate for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter, abbr VMAT2 vesicular monoamine transporter 2. Following amphetamine uptake at VMAT2, the synaptic vesicle releases dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange. Subsequently, the cytosolic dopamine molecules exit the presynaptic neuron via reverse transport at abbr DAT dopamine transporter.
=Norepinephrine=
Similar to dopamine, amphetamine dose-dependently increases the level of synaptic norepinephrine, the direct precursor of epinephrine. Based upon neuronal abbr TAAR1 trace amine-associated receptor 1 abbr mRNA messenger RNA expression, amphetamine is thought to affect norepinephrine analogously to dopamine. In other words, amphetamine induces TAAR1-mediated efflux and nowrap non-competitive reuptake inhibition at phosphorylated abbr NET norepinephrine transporter, competitive NET reuptake inhibition, and norepinephrine release from abbr VMAT2 vesicular monoamine transporter 2.
=Serotonin=
Amphetamine exerts analogous, yet less pronounced, effects on serotonin as on dopamine and norepinephrine. Amphetamine affects serotonin via abbr VMAT2 vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and, like norepinephrine, is thought to phosphorylate abbr SERT serotonin transporter via abbr TAAR1 trace amine-associated receptor 1.
=Other neurotransmitters=
Amphetamine has no direct effect on acetylcholine neurotransmission, but several studies have noted that acetylcholine release increases after its use. In lab animals, amphetamine increases acetylcholine levels in certain brain regions as a downstream effect.  In humans, a similar phenomenon occurs via the ghrelin-mediated cholinergicdopaminergic reward link in the ventral tegmental area. This heightened cholinergic activity leads to increased nicotinic receptor activation in the abbr CNS central nervous system, a factor which likely contributes to the nootropic effects of amphetamine.cite journal   author = Levin ED, Bushnell PJ, Rezvani AH   title = Attention-modulating effects of cognitive enhancers   journal = Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav.   volume = 99   issue = 2   pages = 146154  date=August 2011   pmid = 21334367   pmc = 3114188   doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2011.02.008 
Extracellular levels of glutamate, the primary Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine.  This cotransmission effect was found in the mesolimbic pathway, an area of the brain implicated in reward, where amphetamine is known to affect dopamine neurotransmission.  Amphetamine also induces effluxion of histamine from synaptic vesicles in abbr CNS central nervous system mast cells and histaminergic neurons through abbr VMAT2 vesicular monoamine transporter 2.
Pharmacokinetics
The oral bioavailability of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH; it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically over&nbsp;75% for dextroamphetamine. Amphetamine is a weak base with a Acid dissociation constant pKa of nowrap 910; consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its lipid soluble free base form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich cell membranes of the gut epithelium. Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water soluble cationic salt form, and less is absorbed. Approximately nowrap 1540% of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins.
The Biological half-life half-life of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine pH.  At normal urine pH, the half-lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are nowrap 911&nbsp;hours and nowrap 1114&nbsp;hours, respectively. An acidic diet will reduce the enantiomer half-lives to nowrap 811&nbsp;hours; an alkaline diet will increase the range to nowrap 1631&nbsp;hours.cite encyclopedia   title=AMPHETAMINE  section=Biological Half-Life  section-url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+300-62-9  work=United States National Library of Medicine  Toxnet  publisher=Hazardous Substances Data Bank  accessdate=5 January 2014  quote=Concentrations of 14C-amphetamine declined less rapidly in the plasma of human subjects maintained on an alkaline diet urinary pH   7.5 than those on an acid diet urinary pH  The immediate-release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3&nbsp;hours and 7&nbsp;hours post-dose respectively.  Amphetamine is eliminated via the kidneys, with nowrap 3040% of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH.  When the urinary pH is basic, amphetamine is in its free base form, so less is excreted.  When urine pH is abnormal, the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of&nbsp;1% to a high of&nbsp;75%, depending mostly upon whether urine is too basic or acidic, respectively.  Amphetamine is usually eliminated within two days of the last oral dose.  Apparent half-life and duration of effect increase with repeated use and accumulation of the drug.cite encyclopedia   author = Richard RA   title = Chapter 5Medical Aspects of Stimulant Use Disorders   series = Treatment Improvement Protocol 33   year = 1999   work = National Center for Biotechnology Information Bookshelf   publisher = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration   section-url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64323/   section = Route of Administration

Amphetamine has a very similar structure and function to the wikt:endogenous endogenous trace amines, which are naturally occurring neurotransmitter molecules produced in the human body and brain.  Among this group, the most closely related compounds are phenethylamine, the parent compound of amphetamine, and nowrap N-methylphenethylamine N-methylphenethylamine, an isomer of amphetamine i.e., it has an identical molecular formula.cite journal  author=Lindemann L, Hoener MC  title=A renaissance in trace amines inspired by a novel GPCR family  journal=Trends Pharmacol.

In humans, phenethylamine is produced directly from L-phenylalanine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase AADC enzyme, which converts L-DOPA into dopamine as well. In turn, nowrap Nmethylphenethylamine is metabolized from phenethylamine by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, the same enzyme that metabolizes norepinephrine into epinephrine.cite journal   author = Broadley KJ   title = The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines   journal = Pharmacol.

Since the first preparation was reported in 1887, numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed.cite journal   author = Allen A, Cantrell TS   title = Synthetic reductions in clandestine amphetamine and methamphetamine laboratories: A review   journal = Forensic Science International   date = August 1989   volume = 42   issue = 3   pages = 183199   doi = 10.1016/0379-07388990086-8 cite journal   url = http://www.nwafs.org/newsletters/2011_Spring.pdf   title = Review: Synthetic Methods for Amphetamine   author = Allen A, Ely R   format = PDF   work =   publisher = Northwest Association of Forensic Scientists   volume = 37   issue = 2   year = 2009   pages = 1525   journal = Crime Scene   accessdate = 6 December 2014  Many of these syntheses are based on classic organic reactions.

A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a Organic redox reaction#Organic reductions reduction of a nitro group nitro, imine, oxime or other nitrogen-containing functional group.

The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non-metal reduction known as the Leuckart reaction method 6.  In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and formamide, either using additional formic acid or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields nowrap N-formylamphetamine N-formylamphetamine.  This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base.

In one example, optically pure nowrap R-1-phenyl-ethanamine is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral schiff base.  In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group.  Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine.Cite book    editor = Johnson DS, Li JJ   author = Gray DL   title = The Art of Drug Synthesis   chapter = Approved Treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Amphetamine Adderall, Methylphenidate Ritalin, and Atomoxetine Straterra   chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=zvruBDAulWEC&lpg=PP1&dq=The%20Art%20of%20Drug%20Synthesis%20Wiley%20Series%20on%20Drug%20Synthesis&pg=SA17-PA4#v=onepage&q=amphetamine&f=false   year = 2007   publisher = Wiley-Interscience   location = New York, USA   isbn = 9780471752158   page = 247

For the assays, a study noted that an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique EMIT assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine may produce more false positives than Liquid chromatographymass spectrometry#Proteomics/metabolomics liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry GCMS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the derivatizing agent nowrap S--trifluoroacetylprolyl chloride allows for the detection of methamphetamine in urine.  GCMS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the chiral derivatizing agent Mosher's acid Mosher's&nbsp;acid chloride allows for the detection of both dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in urine.  Hence, the latter method may be used on samples that test positive using other methods to help distinguish between the various sources of the drug.

Pharmaceutical products
The only currently prescribed amphetamine formulation that contains both enantiomers is Adderall. Amphetamine is also prescribed in Enantiopure drug enantiopure and prodrug form as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine respectively. Lisdexamfetamine is structurally different from amphetamine, and is inactive until it metabolizes into dextroamphetamine. The free base of racemic amphetamine was previously available as Benzedrine, Psychedrine, and Sympatedrine.cite encyclopedia   title=Amphetamine   section-url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00182#identification   section=Identification   work=DrugBank   publisher= University of Alberta   accessdate=13 October 2013   date=8 February 2013  Levoamphetamine was previously available as Cydril. All current amphetamine pharmaceuticals are salt chemistry salts due to the comparatively high volatility of the free base. Some of the current brands and their generic equivalents are listed below.
