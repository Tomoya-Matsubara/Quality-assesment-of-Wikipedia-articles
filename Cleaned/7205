Roach Motel is a brand of a roach bait device designed to catch cockroaches. Although the term is the subject of a trademark registration by the insect control brand Black Flag, the phrase has come to be used as a reference to all traps that use a scent or other form of bait to lure cockroaches into a compartment in which a sticky substance causes them to become trapped. Introduced in late 1976 in response to the success of D-Con's roach trap, the Roach Motel quickly became a successful entrant in the industry. By 1979, New York Magazine reported:
Early versions of the Roach Motels used food-based bait, but later designs incorporated pheromones. The widely known tagline of the Roach Motel was &quot;Roaches check in, but they don't check out!&quot;
The name &quot;Roach Motel&quot; is United States federal trademark No. 1,059,314, for which Black Flag claims a date of earliest use of May 7, 1976.
