A Different Kind of Truth is the twelfth studio album by American hard rock band Van Halen. Released on February 7, 2012, A Different Kind of Truth is Van Halen's first full-length, studio album to feature original lead vocalist David Lee Roth since 1984, and also it is the band's first LP release since 1998. It is also the band's first album outside Warner Bros. Records, being released by Interscope Records, and their first studio album not to include original bassist Michael Anthony, with the bass guitar being handled by Wolfgang Van Halen, the son of guitarist Eddie Van Halen and actress Valerie Bertinelli. Produced by John Shanks (notable for producing Fleetwood Mac, among other artists) and Van Halen, A Different Kind of Truth debuted at #2 on Billboard's U.S. Album Charts.
Background
In 2007, Van Halen reunited with original singer David Lee Roth, who had left the band in 1985, for a tour in North America, which would also add as the bassist Wolfgang Van Halen, son of guitarist Eddie Van Halen. The tour, which lasted for 74 shows between September 2007 and June 2008, was critically and commercially successful, earning over $93 million.1 While in 2009 Eddie declared in an interview that &quot;we might not record something new&quot; due to the new songs recorded for the 2004 compilation Best of Both Worlds being ignored by fans and critics alike, and the possible frustration of &quot;record[ing] a new album when people are only going to complain about it or ignore it or somebody is going to download it from the internet for free&quot;,2 the guitarist eventually decided that &quot;we&lt;U+2019&gt;re doing this for us, too&quot;, particularly as Wolfgang was enthusiastic about creating a Van Halen record. In 2010, Eddie, Wolfgang and Alex Van Halen started jam sessions at Eddie's own 5150 Studios, and later went through the band's archives, where Wolfgang picked out demos and unused tunes. Three songs, &quot;She's the Woman&quot;, &lt;U+201C&gt;Bullethead&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;Let&lt;U+2019&gt;s Get Rockin&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+201D&gt; - later renamed &lt;U+201C&gt;Outta Space&lt;U+201D&gt; - were reworked, recorded and sent to Roth, who enjoyed the songs and decided to join the project.3
Wolfgang&lt;U+2019&gt;s original idea for the album was to be a collection of B-sides along with three reworked songs, showcasing hardcore songs such as &lt;U+201C&gt;Drop Dead Legs&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;Girl Gone Bad&lt;U+201D&gt;. Eventually the band found more songs to work on at the archive, and Eddie begun composing new tracks, with the band ending up recording demos for 35 songs. After much deliberation on a self-production or picking an outside producer out of a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks, whom he met at Henson Recording Studios. Shanks liked the first three songs, and then agreed to work on the album, working along with Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks.4 While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 were produced inside 5150, David Lee Roth convinced the band to work in Henson Recording Studios, where he had been recording for over a decade.5
Production
In mid-January 2011, the band moved into Henson studios with Shanks, staff engineer Martin Cooke, and engineer Paul David Hager.6 The band would work twelve hours a day, five days a week, working on the music during the afternoon and Roth coming in to sing at night.7 The instrumental tracks were done in three weeks, with the band playing live as they had had much rehearsal, with Eddie declaring that &quot;we made a few nips and tucks here and there, but everything was pretty much there.&quot; Wolfgang was a instrumental part of production, with his father consulting him as much as Shanks, and the bassist creating a new breakdown on &quot;She's the Woman&quot; - as the original ended up used on Fair Warning{{'}}s (1981) &quot;Mean Street&quot; - and an arrangement for &quot;Stay Frosty&quot; outside the acoustic introduction.8 By the end of March 2011, the band had returned to finish the record at 5150 with engineer Ross Hogarth.9 Most of the work at 5150 was for guitars and bass, as Eddie &quot;couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t hear them at Henson the way I&lt;U+2019&gt;m used to&quot; and both him and Hogarth felt the attempts at mixing were not progressing due to sound quality. Eddie attributed this to the tape machines at Henson, stating that on that studio &quot;everything ended up sounding like it had a sock over it&quot;, a problem that did not repeat when playing the tapes at Eddie's facility.10
The final mix took place over a period of six weeks in the summer of 2011. Each song would be mixed for an entire day, and in the next day it would be tweaked. Hogarth declared that because the process was done at a mixing console, &quot;we couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t move on to the next song until a mix had been approved by everyone and could go off the desk.&quot; Hogarth started with the drums as he considered it the most important about a rock band, and then moved forward with the bass and guitar to finish a backing track, which would be complemented with multing (hiving off different sections of a given part to different tracks) and parallel compression. Then it was finished bringing in Roth&lt;U+2019&gt;s vocals, backing vocals, and details like ad libs, screams and solos.11
Hogarth aimed &quot;to bring Ed&lt;U+2019&gt;s guitar sound into the modern era, but maintaining all the DNA of the past.&quot; He suggested to Eddie that instead of doing again the guitar to the left speaker and the effects panned to the right, the guitar sound was split naturally instead of electronically using two guitar amplifiers place far apart. The idea was to have a guitar sound &quot;that was wide and mono, and not digital delay-driven, and it&lt;U+2019&gt;s what you hear on the record, with only a few overdubs &lt;U+2014&gt; the classic Van Halen sound is not to have a rhythm guitar when he solos&quot;. A more complex structure was made for Wolfgang Van Halen's bass, as the band wanted &quot;a bass sound that covered the whole spectrum, from high to low and clean to dirty&quot;, and up to eight microphones recorded his instrument. A multi-mic set-up was also employed for Alex Van Halen's drums, with most of the final drumming coming from overhead microphones Hogarth dubbed &quot;press conference&quot;. Roth's vocals were all recorded at Henson, without compression.12
Songs
The songs on A Different Kind of Truth were described by Roth as &quot;a sort of collaboration with [Van Halen's] past.&quot;13 Seven tracks that appear on the album are based on material which Roth notes, &quot;Eddie and I generated, literally, in 1975, 1976, and 1977&quot;,14 and Eddie added that &quot;I wrote some of those songs when I was still in high school and even junior high.&quot;15 1970's recordings exist of what became &quot;She's the Woman&quot;, &quot;Outta Space&quot;, &quot;Big River&quot;, &quot;Beats Workin'&quot;, &quot;Tattoo&quot;, and &quot;Bullethead&quot;.16
With the exception of &quot;She&lt;U+2019&gt;s The Woman&quot; and &quot;Bullethead&quot;, Roth rewrote the lyrics for the other tracks, putting a point of view coming from his present personal life.17 Roth declared that &quot;All music is autobiographic. Particularly when it&lt;U+2019&gt;s not meant to be.&lt;U+201D&gt;, adding that by retooling the songs &quot;there is a body of new that meets halfway there, that I think makes very colourful sense.&quot;18
Lyrical themes on the album are diverse; however, a majority of songs deal with cyclical successes, failures, and fate, in an intricate but generally tongue-in-cheek style.19 Such lyrical themes are present on &quot;She's the Woman&quot;, &quot;China Town&quot;, &quot;Blood and Fire&quot;, &quot;Bullethead&quot;, &quot;As Is&quot;, &quot;The Trouble with Never&quot;, &quot;Stay Frosty&quot;, and &quot;Beats Workin'&quot;.
Only lead single &quot;Tattoo&quot; contains a synthesizer, played by Roth. Two songs, &quot;You And Your Blues&quot; and &quot;As Is&quot;, have a processed guitar that sounds like a synth.20 Roth also performs the acoustic guitar on the intro for &quot;Stay Frosty&quot;.21
Portions of the song &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; date back to 1984 when it was an instrumental known as &quot;Ripley&quot;, which was featured in the 1984 film The Wild Life.22 Five songs on A Different Kind of Truth are brand new Van Halen compositions though the main riff for As Is was jammed by Eddie Van Halen at the 2003 Namm trade show. &quot;Stay Frosty&quot; and &quot;You and Your Blues&quot; feature both musical and lyrical nods to the blues.
This release is the first Roth-fronted Van Halen studio album not to include an instrumental as a stand-alone track.
Release and packaging
Van Halen had left label Warner Bros. Records in 2002,23 though the band signed a one-record deal with them afterwards in 2004 to release The Best of Both Worlds.24 For A Different Kind of Truth, Columbia Records negotiated with the band but the deal stalled as Roth did not want to sign with the label. Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine intervened, and managed to sign Van Halen into his company.25
A Different Kind of Truth was released on February 7, 2012, in both a regular CD and a deluxe version containing a bonus Acoustic DVD called The Downtown Sessions, which contains acoustic versions of &quot;Panama&quot;, &quot;You and Your Blues&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;.26 Walmart also had a special version bundling a T-shirt along with the CD,27 and Live Nation Entertainment sold online a double gatefold vinyl album that came along wih the deluxe MP3 edition.28
The cover artwork was designed by Los Angeles-based Smog Design, following a concept sent by Roth. The steam locomotive featured is a New York Central Railroad J-3A Dreyfuss Hudson, photographed by Robert Yarnall Richie. Smog co-owner John Heiden picked the image from the Southern Methodist University's photo library, stating he chose it because &quot;Richie&lt;U+2019&gt;s angle on the photo makes it look like the locomotive is in motion and coming off the page&quot;.29 Aside from a reversed angle of the locomotive, the artwork appears very similar to the 1975 Commodores album Movin' On.30 The booklet includes Roth's handwritten lyrics for the songs31
Singles
The first single from the album, &quot;Tattoo&quot;, was released on January 10, 2012.32 One day after its release to iTunes, it was the #1 selling rock song in the US, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands, while charting in Sweden, Belgium, Germany and the UK.33 By January 23, 2012, &quot;Tattoo&quot; was ranked #1 on Billboard's Hard Rock Singles chart, the #1 most played song at classic rock radio in its first week and #1 most added song at mainstream and active rock radio.34
&quot;She's the Woman&quot; was released as the second single, which was serviced to radio on February 28, 2012.35 A video was released online on April 13, 2012,36 and on May 4 a promotional vinyl 7&quot; single was serviced to 83 indie stores to be given with purchases of A Different Kind of Truth.37
Tour
After three warm-up shows at Cafe Wha? in New York City, Henson Studios in Hollywood, California, and The Forum in Inglewood, California, the band started the A Different Kind of Truth Tour in Louisville, Kentucky on February 18, lasting 46 shows until June 26th in New Orleans. The tour was the eighth most lucrative of 2012, with a total gross of $54,425,548 with and 9 sellouts with attendance of 522,296. 38 A second North American leg was cancelled with the band claiming exhaustion,39 followed by three concerts in Japan being postponed as Eddie had an emergency surgery to treat for diverticulitis.40
Reception
Critical reception
Upon its release, A Different Kind of Truth received positive reviews from music critics.4142 Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 21 reviews, which is on the high end of &quot;generally favorable reviews.&quot;43
The Montreal Gazette gave the album 4/5 stars, and USA Today gave the album 3.5/4 stars, and said that &quot;this is the true kick in the butt that arena rock desperately needs.&quot;44 The Guardian gave the album four stars out of a possible five, writing that the album was &quot;a frequently thrilling return&quot; with songs that &quot;crackle, fizz, and bulge with priapic exuberance&quot;.45 Likewise, Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four stars out of five and wrote: &quot;Van Halen are using their history to revive their present and they succeed surprisingly well on A Different Kind of Truth.&quot;46 William Clark of Guitar International gave the album a positive review, saying &quot;A Different Kind of Truth features some of the most elaborate, expansive, and simply wowing guitar playing that Eddie has passionately poured into a single album&quot;.47
SPIN magazine wrote, &quot;the frantic, haute-for-teacher &quot;As Is&quot; and the mid-tempo shoulda-been-the-single &quot;You and Your Blues&quot; can hang with any heavy-breathing romp they made in their heyday.&quot;48 The A.V. Club's Steven Hyden stated, &quot;After so many years of fumbling dysfunction that reduced the once-proud Van Halen name to a laughingstock, A Different Kind Of Truth matters because it&lt;U+2019&gt;s a reminder of why this band mattered,&quot; while noting that, &quot;Roth deserves some of the credit for that. For whatever reason, when Roth is in the band, Eddie Van Halen plays guitar like the world wants him to play guitar.&quot;49 Rolling Stone gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars, with critic Rob Sheffield stating, &quot;Van Halen's &quot;heard you missed us, we're back&quot; album is not only the most long-awaited reunion joint in the history of reunion joints, it is &lt;U+2013&gt; against all reasonable expectations &lt;U+2013&gt; a real Van Halen album.&quot;50
Guitar World picked A Different Kind of Truth as the best album of 2012.51 Rolling Stone named &quot;Stay Frosty&quot; the 16th best song of 2012,52 and the magazine's readers put it as the fifth best album of the year.53
