 F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden National Park () is a Swedish national park traversed by the river Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, about 140Â km north of Stockholm. It covers 10,100 hectares, of which 4110 aquatic, on the frontier between the counties of Dalarna and G&lt;U+00E4&gt;vleborg.
After the retreat of the ice sheet that covered the region after the last ice age, the river found itself rerouted by an esker onto a plain uniquely ribbed by the ridges of other eskers, where it formed a succession of rapids and wide bays (called fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rdar), which the river inundates during the spring floods. This particular hydrography, along with the park's proximity to the ecological frontier between the north and the south, has favored the development of a fauna and flora of great biodiversity. The park possesses coniferous, mixed, and broadleaf forests, some of which quite ancient, spared by the logging industry because of their inaccessibility. These forests constitute the ideal environment for numerous species, in particular birds, with critical densities of woodpeckers and owls.
If the presence of humans was relatively discreet since the Stone Age, concentrated principally atop the eskers, the development of mining activity (in particular of iron) has profoundly affected the region. The forests were exploited to feed the water-powered forges which grew up along the river. One of the most important was that of Gysinge, founded in 1668 and situated right next to the park. In 1975, in reaction to the threat of the clearing of a vast forest, the movement for the creation of a national park began, culminating in the park's opening in 1998. The park was added to the Natura 2000 Network and included in the Ramsar Convention's list of wetlands.
The park and its environs are important tourist destinations. The river is its favored mode of discovery, but some hiking trails permit other explorations. The park is equally appreciated by fishing enthusiasts.
Toponymy
The park takes its name from F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden, which designates the entire section of the river between Tyttbo and Gysinge. The name means &quot;fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd of F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo&quot;. The Swedish word fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd has the same etymology as the Norwegian word fjord, both of which Scandinavian words mean &quot;an expanse of water in a channel&quot;.1 Most of the bodies of water called fjords in Norwegian were steep glacial valleys into which the sea had penetrated, which was the more restrictive definition which passed into French2 and English. The name Fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo is the ancient name of the village of &lt;U+00D6&gt;sterf&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo (&quot;East F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo&quot;), situated near the park; its name changed in the 17th century to distinguish it from a F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo in V&lt;U+00E4&gt;stmanland, which was itself rebaptized V&lt;U+00E4&gt;sterf&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo (&quot;West F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo&quot;).3 The name of the village means &quot;habitation (bo) next to the fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd of horsetails (fr&lt;U+00E4&gt;ken, which became F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rne)&quot;.4
Geography
Location and environs
 The park straddles the municipalities of Sala in V&lt;U+00E4&gt;stmanland County, Heby in Uppsala County, Avesta in Dalarna County, et de Sandviken in G&lt;U+00E4&gt;vleborg County.56 It contains a section of the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, which since the Middle Ages has marked the frontier between Svealand et Norrland.7 The park's main entrance, at Gysinge, is about  from the city of Uppsala8 and so about  from Stockholm.
The park proper includes most of the fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd of F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden and the river's floodplain, as well as parts of the surrounding lowlands, for a total area of more than , of which  are water.9 The only parts of the fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd not included in the park are the peninsulas of &lt;U+00D6&gt;sta and Ista, since they are inhabited, but these are protected by nature preserves of 10 and ,11 respectively. In addition, the park is bordered by several additional preserves:  at Hedesundafj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden,  at Jordb&lt;U+00E4&gt;rsmuren-&lt;U+00C5&gt;lbo, and  at Gysinge, for a combined area, with the park and peninsula reserves, of more than .
Terrain
The terrain of the park is overall flat, with an altitude ranging from  to  below sea level.12 Certain parts are nevertheless quite hilly, such as Torr&lt;U+00F6&gt;sundet, L&lt;U+00E5&gt;ngvindsj&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and the valleys of the Ti&lt;U+00E5&gt;n and the Stor&lt;U+00E5&gt;n.13 In addition, the ridge Enk&lt;U+00F6&gt;pings&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen cuts across the park, with a maximum height of ,14 crisscrossing the region over  between Trosa to the south and Bolln&lt;U+00E4&gt;s to the north.15 This ridge spans the river and creates, among other land features, the isle of Sand&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and the peninsula of Ista.16 The river has largely flooded this flat and irregular zone, creating a mosaic of water, dry earth, and wetlands. The park also includes several bays (&lt;U+00D6&gt;staviken, Andersboviken, Edsviken, etc.) as well as 200 islands and skerries, the largest islands being Matt&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, Torr&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, &lt;U+00C4&gt;ngs&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, Ved&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, Ros&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and V&lt;U+00E4&gt;ster&lt;U+00F6&gt;n.17
Climate
The park is bathed in a continental climate (Dfb in the K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification), with rain mostly in summer.18 It is situated on the climate frontier between north and south, which helps determine the Limes Norrlandicus marking the border between the north of Scandinavia and the south.19 The snow cover lasts a little over 3 months20 and the river is frozen during a similar period, with the exception of the rapids, which remain ice-free for most of the winter.21
Hydrography
The park is situated along the course of the Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, the second longest Swedish river at .22 The river begins at the confluence of the V&lt;U+00E4&gt;sterdal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven and the &lt;U+00D6&gt;sterdal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven in Gagnef Municipality.23 At Avesta, the river, which until then was trapped in a narrow valley, becomes the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven (), and large floodplains (called fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rdar) alternate with zones of rapids.24 F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden is the first big floodplain of the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, situated between the rapids of Tyttbo to the west and Gysinge and Sevedskvarn to the east.25
The rapids of Gysinge.
At Gysinge, the river already has a watershed of , for an average flow of .26 While the flow of the river &lt;U+00D6&gt;sterdal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven is controlled (at Tr&lt;U+00E4&gt;ngslet and the lake Siljan), the course of the V&lt;U+00E4&gt;sterdal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven is free, and thus has the largest seasonal variations.27 As a result, when it reaches the park, the river is still relatively little regulated, with a speed varying from  to more than .28 It is, in particular, the sole fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rd with a mouth that remains unregulated.29 The regulation of the &lt;U+00D6&gt;sterdal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven has all the same an impact upon F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden, the great inundations of the plains during the spring floods being more rare, even if they are nevertheless capable of inundating several dozens of square kilometers.30
Besides the Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, there are many streams inside the park, which flow into the river. Among these, one can number the Lill&lt;U+00E5&gt;n, the Stor&lt;U+00E5&gt;n, the Alderb&lt;U+00E4&gt;cken and the Ti&lt;U+00E5&gt;n on the right (south) bank, and B&lt;U+00E4&gt;rreks&lt;U+00E5&gt;n and Laggarbo&lt;U+00E5&gt;n along the right bank.31 One can find also five small lakes inside the park, in particular around Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set.32 It is also near Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set that the principal bogs of the park, Lindebergsmossen and Svarviksmossen, are situated.33  of the park are marshes and bogs, making up more than 20% of its total surface, and more than a third of the non-aquatic surface area of the park.34
Geology
Along its new course, the river created a mosaic of water, marsh, and forest.
The bedrock of the park is of granite and granitic gneiss, and dates from the formation of the Svecofennids, a mountain chain formed between 1750 and 2500 million years ago.35 It underwent a long erosion, leading 600 million years ago to that which one calls the Precambrian peneplain.36
During the last ice age, Sweden was covered with an ice sheet, which withdrew from the region about 10000 years ago.37 The glacier left behind in the region many eskers and moraines, such as the esker Enk&lt;U+00F6&gt;pings&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen.38 When the glacier withdrew, the soil had been so compressed by its mass that the entire zone situated to the east of Avesta found itself at sea level.39 During this maritime period, sediments deposited themselves on the bedrock, which explains why that region even today has superior fertility to that of the rest of the country.40 It is the reason why the line of separation between the north and the south (the Limes Norrlandicus), which passes not far from the park, is so visible in the region: the zone to the north of the limes was not covered with these sediments.41
When this sea, called the Littorina Sea, the ancestor of the Baltic Sea, withdrew, the Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven found itself blocked at Avesta by one of these eskers formed by the ice sheet: Badelunda&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen.42 In effect, before the ice age, the river continued in the direction of the M&lt;U+00E4&gt;laren, in which it emptied itself and it so had flooded a valley along this entire section.43 Because of the fact of the presence of this obstacle, it was forced to head northeast.44 So, in the whole section of the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, the river did not have the time to flood a true valley.45 It thus had to adapt itself to the topology of the terrain, forming large fj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rds with many isles in the flattest sections and by contrast a course narrower and faster at the different eskers encountered along the way.46
Natural environment
The park of F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden is according to the classification of the WWF, situated in the terrestrial ecoregion of Sarmatic mixed forests,47 not far from the frontier of the Scandinavian and Russian taiga.
Flora
Coniferous forest on the isle of Matt&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, in the northeast of the park.
Almost all the types of forest of central Sweden are present in the park, which is due to both the presence of dry and wet environments and to the proximity of the line Limes Norrlandicus marking the frontier betwee the environments of the north and south.48 This implies the presence in the park of environments and species characteristic to both the North and the South of Sweden.49 A great number of endangered species appear in the park: two species of vascular plants,50 25 species of mosses,51 34 species of lichens and 22 species of fungi.52
The park presents different environments as regards flora, the principal being the forests of conifers ( making up 9.9% of the park), the mixed forests ( making up 14.5% of the park), of open bogs ( making up 16.3% of the park) and woods ( making up 5% of the park) and finally wetlands ( making up 7.4% of the park).53
The forests of conifers, principally of Norway spruce (), are in particular present in the south of the park,54 around Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set, on the isle of Torr&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and the peninsula of &lt;U+00D6&gt;byhalv&lt;U+00F6&gt;n.55 These forests have not been logged since the 1950s and certain trees are themselves over 120 years old.56 These old trees as well as the presence of dead wood give this forest a very ancient appearance, and contribute to a great richness of lichens and fungi.57 The soil is often covered in moss, the characteristic species being , but  and  are also common.58 One can also find European blueberries () and lingonberries () in the undergrowth.59
Wetlands on the isle of Matt&lt;U+00F6&gt;n.
In the zones most subject to inundations, conifers are more rare, since they do not like in general the wetter zones.60 In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the the aspen (), very common in the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, but rare in the rest of the country.61 These forests also have English oaks () and small-leaved lindens () and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders (), birch trees and willows62{{,}}.63 The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, bog bilberries (), wild rosemary () and cloudberry (), whereas the richer soils are home in particular to lillies of the valley (), woodland strawberries (), () and yellow loosestrife ().64
Where the floods are less frequent the hardwoods themselves are absent, giving way to open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog.65 The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanch&lt;U+00E2&gt;tres, by purple moor grass (), , yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil (), lesser spearwort (), common marsh-bedstraw (), kingcup (), purple loosestrife () and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country.66 In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle (), , common cottongrass () and species of Carex.67 The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.68
Fauna
Mammals
 The park is host to many species of mammals. The most widespread are the moose (), the roe deer (), the mountain hare (), the red fox (), and the pine marten ()69. Since the 1980s, one can also see Eurasian beaver () near the islands of Torr&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and &lt;U+00C4&gt;ngs&lt;U+00F6&gt;n as well as near Gysinge70. In 2008, it was similarly found that the wild boar () was wont to settle the park71. More rarely, one sees also the wood lemming () in the north part of the park72. Four species of mammals present in the park are considered endangered in Sweden73. Thus, the Eurasian lynx () can be observed regularly around &lt;U+00D6&gt;byhalv&lt;U+00F6&gt;n, Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set and G&lt;U+00E4&gt;rdsvekarna, alongside brown bears () and gray wolves (), although these are less frequent74. The three other endangered species are the European otter () that one can see near the rapids, and two species of bats, the pond bat (, very rare in Sweden) and the common noctule ()75.
Birds

Birds are without question F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden's most numerous class of animal.76 More than 200 species have been reported of which at least 107 nest regularly in the park77. This richness is in part connected to the presence of characteristic species of both the south and the north78. In addition, the park contains species of bird both aquatic and sylvan79.
The park has a rich population of aquatic birds, attracted by the shallow, fish-rich waters. The proximity of big trees, especially pines, affords them good nesting opportunities80. The most common species are the common gull (), the common tern (), le black-throated loon (), and the mute swan ()81. In the wetlands, one often finds the grey heron (), the western capercaillie () or even the common crane ()82. One of the most notable aquatic species is the osprey (), with thirty couples &lt;U+2014&gt; probably one of the most important densities of the country83. The white-tailed eagle (), a species classified as endangered in the country, practically vanished from the park in the 1970s, but it is now returned84.
The Ural owl, symbol of the park.
However, it is the forest species which are the most notable of the park, especially the woodpeckers and owls85. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker () is the most common, but the black woodpecker (), the European green woodpecker () and the lesser spotted woodpecker () are also themselves common86. The population of white-backed woodpecker (), a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals in the whole country in 200487, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 200388, and then a new couple in 201089. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker () is becoming more common90. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl () and the Ural owl ()91. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park92. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard (), the Eurasian hobby (), or even, among others, the European honey buzzard ()93.
Reptiles and amphibians
 The park has all major Swedish species of amphibians94. Among these species, one can number the common toad (), the common frog () and the moor frog (), as well as the northern crested newt () and the smooth newt ()95. Among the reptiles, the most common species are two snakes, the common European adder () and the grass snake (), as well as the viviparous lizard () and the slowworm ()96.
Fish
The waters of the park are among Sweden's richest, which can be explained by a great number of factors, such as their optimal acidity, a great richness of nutrients, or even, among other things, the zones of rapids alternating with calmer zones97. These waters permit the park have not only a great number of species, but also a great number of individual fish and certain fish of enormous size98. Among the species present, one can name several species of cyprinids (the family of carp, minnows, barbs, barbels, and others), of which in particular the asp (), rare in Sweden99. The waters abound also with northern pike (), with specimens weighing sometimes , with redfin perch (), with zander (), and with grayling () &lt;U+2014&gt; which species is classified as endangered in Sweden, much like the brown trout ()100. The Atlantic salmon () was also present in the park's waters, but the dams downstream have considerably reduced its possibilities of rejoining the park101. The noble crayfish (), a species endangered worldwide102, was relatively common in the waters of the Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven, but has now almost disappeared; some catches in the park are however reported from time to time103.
Insects
Only the insects of the forests have been reliably inventoried, but more than 70 species of insect are already inscribed on the list of species endangered in Sweden104. The presence of dead wood favors the presence of numerous insects105. Most of the forest insects live in the sapwood or between the sapwood and the bark106. In particular, the Norway spruce and the English oak are the trees supporting the greatest richness in insects107.
The species of insect most associated with the park and the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven in general are mosquitos of the genus Aedes108. Indeed, the park's wetlands are enormously productive in mosquitos, especially during the heavy spring floods109. The quantity of mosquitos in the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven has no equivalent in Sweden besides that in the vast wetlands of Lappland110. This abundance bothers not only the park's tourists during the summer111 but also the entire region as far as Uppsala112. Between 2002 and 2008, the insecticide  was used to try to regulate these populations, which needed a waiver, its use being forbidden in Sweden and contrary to the principles of the national park113. However, the project was not renewed, this method not being considered a durable solution and some scientists arguing that the mosquitos make up part of the region's ecosystem114.
History
Initial settlements and agriculture
ago, the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven was a bay of the Littorina Sea, but as the land rose, the crests (eskers) became the best sites for the first permanent settlements.115 It was easy to nourish oneself, thanks to the river, and these places were the easiest to defend.116 In addition, the river was easer to cross at this point.117 In addition, it is atop the esker of Enk&lt;U+00F6&gt;pings&lt;U+00E5&gt;sen that one finds most of the prehistoric sites,118 and many of today's routes follow the trace of ancient routes along the eskers.119 Among the park's prehistoric sites, one can count the Stone Age sites at Tr&lt;U+00E5&gt;ngn&lt;U+00E4&gt;s and Sand&lt;U+00F6&gt;n et the cairns atop Hem&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and Ut&lt;U+00F6&gt;n.120
When sedentary agriculture developed in the region during the Bronze and Iron Ages, the slopes of the crests were again the favorite settlement sites, being easier to cultivate and above the floodplain.121 However, these wetlands were also used for haymaking, giving an important production of good quality.122 The hay was stocked in nearby barns and carried to the surrounding villages during the winter to feed the animals.123 Some of these barns are still visible near Torr&lt;U+00F6&gt;sundet and atop V&lt;U+00E4&gt;ster&lt;U+00F6&gt;n.124 Woodlands were summer granting lands (transhumance) and some cabins () were constructed there in order to look after the animals during this time.125 Fifteen of these cabins are scattered in and around the park, mainly near Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set and south of Gysinge.126 Transhumance ceased at the beginning of the 20th century.127
Industry
 One of the characteristics of the region that has strongly influenced the mode of life there ever since the Iron Age is its abundance of metals, in particular of iron.128 The settlers began then to combine agriculture with iron extraction.129 This exploitation has left numerous traces inside the park. Certain zones in the park were themselves used as extraction sites, such as Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set, where limonite was extracted from the marsh.130 The iron industry in the region necessitated a huge consumption of wood which which initially justified sylviculture in the park.131 Accordingly, the woods of Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set, for example, were heavily logged to feed the silver mine of Sala.132 At the end of the 19th century, many mills were constructed along the river: they were used for timber rafting.133 This activity ceased upon the creation of dams along the river.134 Gysinge has a timber rafting museum.135 The wettest forests largely escaped the logging industry, thereby serving as sanctuaries of biodiversity during this period of exploitation.136
However, the most evident trace of the iron industry in the region is the forge of Gysinge. This forge was established in 1668137 initially for the production of arms.138 The forge's location permitted a good access to metal, extracted at the mine of Dannemora,139 to wood and to the energy of the Gysinge rapids. The forge grew rapidly and in the 18th century there were constructed around the forge homes, mills, stables, a manor and even a hotel.140 In the 18th century, the forge was one of the largest in the country, with 50 people working at the mill proper, and 3000 people connected to the forge in other ways.141 The forge was also the first in the world to use an oven for induction, the oven Kjellin.142 The forge closed at the beginning of the 20th century.143
A hydroelectric plant was constructed at Gysinge in 1917,144 but it consists only of one small scale plant, using one deflection of a small part of the river.
Protection
The Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven has for a long time been recognized in Sweden as a remarkable site worthy of protection.145 In the 1960s, the Swedish society for nature conservation (naturskyddsf&lt;U+00F6&gt;reningen) engaged itself for the protection of F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden, in particular the area of Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set, and made many inventories in the area.146 At the beginning of the 1970s, Stora AB tried to clear all the forests it owned in the northern part of Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set.147 In response the ornithologist Stig Holmstedt made contact with the Swedish nature conservation society and formed a group to work towards the protection of the zone,148 which led to the formation of a proposition for a national park in 1975.149 Only the commune of Sandviken took up the idea and formed the same year the nature reserve of Gysinge.150 In the following years, the geomorphology, fauna and flora of the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven were systematically inventoried.151 This began at the formulation of a protection plan by Naturv&lt;U+00E5&gt;rdsverket and the concerned counties.152 In 1989, in the first directive for the creation of national parks established by Naturv&lt;U+00E5&gt;rdsverket, F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden was proposed as a future national park.153 In 1997, F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden is proposed on the list of the Ramsar Convention,154 and, finally, the national park was established by the king on 10 September 1998.155 The motive for creating the park was to preserve a unique fluvial landscape as well as rich forests and and surrounding wetlands in a relatively intact state.156 It thus includes a large part of the old reserve of Gysinge, which accordingly was reformed in 1999 with all the zones not included in the park.157 19 Novemebr 2001, the park was finally added to the Ramsar list.158 It is also included in the Natura 2000 Network.159 In 2011, the Lower Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven was classified as a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO under the name country of the river Nedre Dal&lt;U+00E4&gt;lven.160
Management and administration
 Like most of the Swedish national parks, the management and administration are divided between the Swedish environmental protection agency (Naturv&lt;U+00E5&gt;rdsverket) and the administrative council of the counties (L&lt;U+00E4&gt;nsstyrelse).161 Naturv&lt;U+00E5&gt;rdsverket is charged with the proposal of new national parks, through consultation with administrative councils of the counties and municipalities; a vote of the parliament endorses their creation.162 If a park is approved, the state buys the land, through the intermediairy of the Naturv&lt;U+00E5&gt;rdsverket.163 The management of the park is then principally in the hands of the county. Despite the fact that the park of F&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebofj&lt;U+00E4&gt;rden spans the territories of four counties, only the administrative council of V&lt;U+00E4&gt;stmanland is responsible for the management of the park.164 In contrast, park's nature center is led by G&lt;U+00E4&gt;vleborg, since it is situated on G&lt;U+00E4&gt;vleborg's territory.165
The management work for the park includes the maintenance of tourism structures (such as trails, cabins),166 as well as the maintenance of certain meadows.167 If appropriate, the park authorities can regulate the beaver population, which is capable of harming the forest.168 Elk, deer, and American mink hunting is allowed for population regulation purposes, but is forbidden between 1 January and 15 August.169 To protect the birds, access to certain zones can be forbidden during nesting season, from 1 January to 15 June.170 These fixed zones have been replaced in 2015 by the possibility of creating temporary zones permitting themselves to adapt to zones where the most vulnerable species are found.171 The ban on commercial activity has also been lifted.172 Finally, the speed limit for boats was lowered from 12 to 7 knots except for certain sections where the maximum speed is capped at 12 or 20 knots.173
Tourism
thumb|upright=0.8|alt=La tour d'observation du parc|The observation tower offers an exceptional view over the park. The park and the surrounding zones attract many tourists. In addition, the Gysinge forge is visited annually by 250,000 people &lt;U+2014&gt; a figure rapidly growing,174 the peninsula of &lt;U+00D6&gt;sta by 75,000 people and Tyttbo by 10,000 people.175 However, these visits are in general highly localized.176
The main entrances of the park are at Gysinge and Sevedskvarn,177 both situated near national route 56. These entries have parking.178 Camp grounds exist at &lt;U+00D6&gt;sta, Tyttbo and &lt;U+00D6&gt;sterf&lt;U+00E4&gt;rnebo,179 and it is also possible to stay at Gysinge forge's hotel ().180 Inside the park itself, many cabins are available for passing the night, many of them ancient shepherd cabins.181
The principal activities inside the park in summer are sport fishing as well as boat or canoe trips.182 Navigation by boat is in fact one of the best ways to explore the park, and the island of Sand&lt;U+00F6&gt;n is particularly popular.183 The park also attracts many bird watchers in winter and spring, especially near Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set where the birdlife is the richest.184 However, the part of the road that enabled one to get there was closed because it traversed the park &lt;U+2014&gt; which closing was decided during the park's creation.185 As a result, the number of tourists at this location diminished considerably.186 A visitor, information, and nature center was built inside an old barn (dating from 1814) of the Gysinge forge.187 At Skekarsbo, an observation tower  in height was constructed in 1995 and offers a panoramic view over the major part of the park.188 Several hiking trails exist inside the park, in particular in the north part: on the isle of Matt&lt;U+00F6&gt;n (between Gysinge and Sevedskvarn), a part of G&lt;U+00E4&gt;strikeleden across the park from Gysinge, and from Kyrkstigen up to Skekarsbo.189 In the southern part, a long trail leads to Tin&lt;U+00E4&gt;set.190
