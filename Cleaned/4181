 This list of the tallest buildings and structures in Salford ranks skyscrapers, structures and towers in the City of Salford, England by height. The City of Salford, a local government district of Greater Manchester, has a population of 218,000.1 At its core is Salford, a former factory town and inland port with a wealth of Victorian industrial heritage. Most of the city's tallest buildings are residential tower blocks constructed during the mid-20th century in the Brutalist architectural style. However, since the 1996 Manchester bombing, which initiated a redevelopment programme for Greater Manchester, the city has witnessed a boom in the construction of high rise apartments, particularly at Salford Quays, a former dockland.
Geographically, commercially, and culturally, Salford is dominated by its immediate neighbour the major City of Manchester, which lies across River Irwell. Although Salford followed a similar pattern of urbanisation to Manchester during the Industrial Revolution it did not evolve as a commercial centre in the same way.2 In contrast to the vast majority of Manchester's tallest buildings, Salford's high-rises were constructed in the 1960s and 70s as part of a regeneration project to alleviate chronic social deprivation and urban decay.3 Thirty towers at Pendleton once made the highest density housing estate in Europe.4 Some of the early high-rise buildings have subsequently been demolished themselves, as they provided unsatisfactory accommodation for families and caused as many social problems as they were meant to alleviate.5 Others have become accommodation for students at the University of Salford. A study by Professor Christopher Collier of the university suggested that Manchester's drizzly climate is largely due to the multitude of high-rise blocks in Salford.67 Collier has proposed that they have a &quot;dramatic influence on the region's weather patterns&quot;, and may contribute to the 8 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (14 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) temperature difference between Salford and its surrounding countryside.8
The list includes the year of completion for completed buildings, the height in metres and feet, and the current usage of the building. Unlike other cities in the world, Salford's tallest structures are dispersed and not concentrated in a central business district. The tallest building in Salford is the city's North Tower, a high-rise tower block, which was completed in 1966. It is 25 storeys and  high and consists of a Premier Inn hotel.910 The largest skyscraper proposed for the city was Canopus/Greengate Tower,11 a postmodern skyscraper projected to be completed in 2008, which would have stood at .12 However, the project was cancelled,13 and a revised tower of  has been approved to occupy the space.1415 The oldest structure listed is the Neo-gothic Salford Cathedral. It was completed in 1848 and was Salford's tallest building for 121 years.
