Wellingborough is a market town and borough in Northamptonshire, England, situated some  from the county town of Northampton. The town is situated on the north side of the River Nene,1 most of the older town is sited on the flanks of the hills above the river's flood plain.2 Due to frequent flooding by the River Nene, the town was mostly built above the level of the flood plain. Originally named &quot;Wendelingburgh&quot;, the town was founded in the early 6th century Saxon period by a Saxon leader called Waendel3 and is mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name of &quot;Wendelburie&quot;. The town was granted a royal market charter in 1201, by King John of England.4
As of the 2001 census it has a population of 72,519.5 The town of Wellingborough is governed by The Borough Council of Wellingborough, with their office located in the town centre.6 The town is twinned with Niort in France, and with Wittlich in Germany.
The town is predicted to grow by around 30 percent under the Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM) study, as the UK government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire where growth will be directed over the next 30 years. The study allocates 12,800 additional homes mainly to the east of the town.7 The town has also a growing commuter population as it is located on the Midland Main Line railway, which has InterCity trains to London St Pancras International station taking under an hour, giving an interchange with Eurostar services.8
History
The town was founded in the early 6th-century period by a Saxon leader named Waendel and was named 'Wendelingburgh', now known as Wellingborough.9 The town is surrounded by five wells: Red Well, Hemming Well, Stanwell, Lady's Well and Whyte Well, which appear on its coat of arms.10
 The medieval town of Wellingborough housed a modest monastic grange – now the Jacobean Croyland 'Abbey' – which was an offshoot of the larger monastery of Croyland Abbey, near Peterborough, some  down-river. This part of the town is now known as 'Croyland'.11
All Hallows Church12 is the oldest existing building in Wellingborough and dates from c. 1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to Crowland Abbey Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church.13 The earliest part of the building is the Norman doorway opening in from the later south porch. The church was enlarged with the addition of more side chapels and by the end of the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful broach spire rising to , was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later.14 The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by Ninian Comper.15
Wellingborough was given a Market Charter dated 3 April 1201 when King John granted it to the &quot;Abbot of Croyland and the monks serving God there&quot; continuing, &quot;they shall have a market at Wendligburg (Wellingborough) for one day each week that is Wednesday&quot;.16
In the Elizabethan era the Lord of the Manor, Sir Christopher Hatton was a sponsor of Sir Francis Drake's expeditions; Drake renamed one of his ships the Golden Hind after the heraldic symbol of the Hatton family. A hotel in a Grade II listed building built in 1600s, was known variously as the Hind Hotel and later as the Golden Hind Hotel.17
 During the Civil War the largest substantial conflict in the area was the Battle of Naseby in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted in the killing of a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of Roundheads. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of Diggers. Little is known about this period.
Originally the town had two railway stations: the first called ,18 opened in 1845 and closed in 1966, linked Peterborough with Northampton. The second station, Wellingborough Midland Road, is still in operation with trains to London and the East Midlands. Since then the 'Midland Road' was dropped from the station name.19 The Midland Road station opened in 1857 with trains serving Kettering and a little later Corby, was linked in 1867 to London St Pancras. In 1898 in the Wellingborough rail accident six or seven people died and around 65 were injured.20 In the 1880s two businessmen held a public meeting to build three tram lines in Wellingborough, the group merged with a similar company in Newport Pagnell who started to lay tram tracks, but within two years the plans were abandoned due to lack of funds.21

Geography
Geology
The town is sited on the hills adjoining the flood plain of the River Nene.2728 In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils seems to have been good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations.29 On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.
Iron ore
The most economically important aspect of the geology of the area is the Northampton Sands ironstone formation. This is a marine sand of Jurassic age (Bajocian stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 wt% iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the Bessemer steel making process and the &quot;basic slag&quot; smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the UK in the run-up to World War II, being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional dip of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.303132
Climate
Wellingborough experiences an oceanic climate (K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification) which is similar to most of the British Isles.
Compass
Wellingborough's nearest towns are Rushden, Higham Ferrers and Irthlingborough.
Demography
Wellingborough's population expanded rapidly from 26,000 to 60,000 in the 1960s and 1970s as agreements were signed between the Urban District Council and London County Council and the Greater London Council for the town to re-house over-spill population from London. Following the post World War II arrival of immigrants from the Commonwealth group of nations into Britain, a sizeable Black Caribbean and Indian/Pakistani community grew up in this small market town, and now represents 7% of the population in the Borough and to 11% within the town.33
Economy
 Wellingborough has approximately 2,500 registered businesses within its boundaries.34 Much of the town centre was redeveloped during the 1970s, when it grew rapidly from London overspill. The Borough Council has adopted a 'Town Centre Action Plan'.35 The former traditional economic structure based on footwear and engineering is gradually diversifying with wholesale, logistics, and service sectors providing new opportunities for employment.
As a market town, Wellingborough has major high street chains mainly located in the town centre. The only shopping centre, Swansgate,36 previously known as the Arndale Centre, was built in the late 1970s. Since 2009 the Borough Council has been looking at rebuilding the centre37 and major stores want bigger floor-spaces.38 Supplementing the town centre shops are several out-of-town retail parks and supermarkets including a Sainsbury's,39 four Tesco's40 stores, an Aldi41 store and a Morrisons42 store in the town centre. The town has a market three times a week and a weekly privately organised market.43
Other businesses operating within the town include motorsport, high performance engineering, distribution, environmental technology and renewable energy, digital and creative media, financial and business services, and global brands. There are several industrial estates in the town, these include Park Farm,44 Denington,45 Layland46 and Finedon Road.47
Future developments
As part of its Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM) study, the government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire into which growth will be directed over the next thirty years. It allocates 12,800 additional homes to Wellingborough, and will also create additional facilities, further improve the town centre, improve infrastructure and increase employment opportunities. A jobs growth target of 12,400 jobs has been set to accompany the large scale housing growth.48 A plan for 3,000 homes north of the town has been accepted by the UK Government after an appeal by Bee Bee Developments. The plan was first refused by Wellingborough Borough Council.49
As a result, plans have been made for a major urban extension in the town, mainly to the east of the railway station. When finished, the town would be around 30% larger and 3,200 new homes would be built on 'Stanton Cross' site, with new Schools, Bus stops, Community Centres, Shops, a Doctor's surgery, and new open spaces.50 The railway station would be developed into an 'interchange' with local buses and trains. The upgrade would provide a new platform, footbridge and new station buildings.51 Outside the station a new road bridge from Midland Road over the railway line is also planned with a new footbridge to reach the new development.52 Other plans to include the development of the High Street, Shelley Road and the north of the town areas are also being considered.5354
