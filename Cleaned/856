Marble Collegiate Church, on Fifth Avenue at 29th Street
The Middle Dutch Church, today known as Middle Collegiate Church refers to a Dutch Reformed congregation in Manhattan in New York City, which has had a variety of church buildings and had fractured into several successor congregations run by the Reformed Protestant Dutch Churches of New York. The congregation was established in 1628.1
1633 church
First church building built on what is now Pearl Street in New Amsterdam, facing the East River, to replace loft services. It was a simple timber structure with a gambrel roof and no spire.2
c.1643 church
The second church was located within Fort Amsterdam's walls. The stone church had a spire with weathercock, and was the tallest structure in the city. After the fall of New Amsterdam to the British, the structure was reused as a military garrison church for the Episcopal faith.3 
1693 Garden Street Church
The Garden Street Church, located on what is now Exchange Place, was built to replace the garrison church after its appropriation by the British. The congregation was granted a full charter as the Dutch Church in America by King William III of England on May 19, 1696.4
1729 Middle Collegiate Church
The original Middle Collegiate Church was on Nassau Street near Cedar Street in 1729. &quot;A North Church was added in 1769, to serve a growing congregation.&quot;5 The church &quot;later became the Post Office, and was demolished in 1882.&quot;6
1839 Second Middle Collegiate Church, or Middle Dutch Church
The Middle Dutch Church or Middle Collegiate Church (1839), located on Lafayette Place near La Grange Terrace, was built as the second Collegiate Church congregation continued to move uptown with the population. Nathan Silver in Lost New York describes this structure as &quot;a single-mindedly classic Greek Revival church by Isaiah Rogers, perhaps his best work. Unfortunately for posterity, the Dutch Reformed (Collegiate) denomination was wealthy enough to move as frequently as the neighborhood ran down. The church&lt;U+2019&gt;s forerunner was built in 1729 at Nassau Street, later became the Post Office, and was demolished in 1882. After the Lafayette Place church was evacuated in 1887 prior to its destruction, a third church was erected at Second Avenue and 7th Street, 'thoroughly equipped' as one guide said, 'with reading-rooms, gymnasium, and all appliances for aggressive modern church work'.&quot;7
