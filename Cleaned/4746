Diptendu Pramanick (July 1910 &lt;U+2013&gt; Dec 1989) () was a bengali film personality from Calcutta. He was the founder secretary of the Eastern India Motion Pictures Association 1 in Calcutta, India - a fraternity of film personnel which is an interface between the entertainment industry of eastern India and the Government. During his multifarious career he came in contact with eminent personalities and saw the evolution of this organization from its initial days to being a regionwide entity.
Early life and education
He was born on July 18, 1910 in Calcutta. He was the eldest son of Sudhamoy Pramanick from Shantipur. He did his early schooling in Calcutta and then at the Raiganj Coronation School, Raiganj where his father practised as a lawyer.
In 1926 he returned to Calcutta and cleared Matriculation followed by the Intermediate examinations in Science in 1928. He then joined the Scottish Church College, Calcutta.
His interactions with many a revolutionary (due to his father's involvement with the Congress and the Satyagraha movement at Raigunj), the explosive air of the times, and the inspiration from a famous alumni (The Oaten Affair) 2 probably drove him to antagonize an Indian-loathing teacher at Scottish Church College, and follow Bose's suit.
He later graduated from Asutosh College, and earned a bachelor's degree in science from the University of Calcutta in 1931.
Career

After leaving college he worked as the Secretary to the then Mayor of Calcutta Sri Santosh Kumar Basu.3 Out of his literary inclinations, he associated with literary conferences and Bengali literature fora.4 The 12th Prabasi Banga-Sahitya Sammelan was inaugurated by Rabindranath Tagore in Calcutta, Dec 1934 (Photo : The Reception Committee was chaired by Ramananda Chatterjee).
On completion of Mr Basu&lt;U+2019&gt;s term as Mayor he became the Liaison Officer of Civil Defense and in the Publicity Section of the Commercial Museum. In 1942 he moved to the Home Department of the then Bengal Government as Liaison Officer, Civil Defense.
Subsequently he tested his skills of entrepreneurship through a venture (Cine Furnishers Limited) with a couple of friends . It is here that he came in close contact with people of the Bengali film industry of Kolkata.
 Diptendu Pramanick
Enthused with these contacts he joined an association of Producers, Distributors and Exhibitors of Bengal (Bengal Motion Pictures Association) in 1948 as Secretary 5 while Sri B. N. Sircar was the President. Next year he started the BMPA journal67 and was the Editor 8910 for more than two decades.1112 The Association was working on a rented premises at 125, Dharamtolla Street (now Lenin Sarani) which was moved to 2, Madan Street, Calcutta. Later the association bought a small premises at 98E Chowringhee Square (now 98E B.N. Sircar Sarani - it's present location ).
He was the first secretary of the then expanded Eastern India Motion Picture Association (EIMPA) and was instrumental in opening the EIMPA offices in Patna and Guwahati.13 In this period the uncertainities of war led to severe shortage of raw film stock in the country. A Film Advisory Committee was formed under the Government of India, and was given control of raw film stock distribution 14. EIMPA played an important role as a trade representative, negotiating materials for the film industry of eastern India and much of Diptendu's efforts were directed for the same. During his tenure he also served as the Secretary of Film Federation of India (1953&lt;U+2013&gt;1954) 15 and the Jt. Treasurer of the Federation of Film Societies of India (FFSI) (1959) presided by Satyajit Ray.16
