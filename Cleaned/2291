The Union process is an above ground shale oil extraction technology for production of shale oil, a type of synthetic crude oil. The process uses a vertical retort where heating causes decomposition of oil shale into shale oil, oil shale gas and spent residue. The particularity of this process is that oil shale in the retort moved countercurrent from the bottom upward to the top by a mechanism known as a rock pump. The process technology was invented by the American oil company Unocal Corporation in late 1940s and was developed through several decades. The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort.
History
Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) started its oil shale activities in 1920s. In 1921, it acquired a oil shale tract in the Parachute Creek area of Colorado, southern Piceance Basin.1 The development of the Union process began in the late 1940s, when the Union A retort was designed.2 This technology was tested between 1954 and 1958 at the company-owned tract in the Parachute Creek.345 During these tests, up to 1,200 tonne per day of oil shale was processed, resulting of  shale oil, which was refined at a Colorado refinery.678 More than  of gasoline and fuels were produced.9 This production was finally shut down in 1961 due to cost.1011
In 1974, the Union B process, evolved from the Union A process, was developed.121314 In 1976, Union announced its plans to build an Union B demonstration plant.15 Construction started in 1981 at Long Ridge in San Miguel County, Colorado, and the plant was started its operations in 1986. It was closed in 1991 after production of  shale oil.161718
Process
The Union process can be operated in two different combustion modes, which are direct and indirect.19 The Union A (direct) process is similar to the gas combustion retort technology, classified as an internal combustion method, while the Union B (indirect) process is classified as an externally generated hot gas method.2021
The Union retort is a vertical shaft retort. The main difference compared with typical vertical shaft retorts is that crushed s oil shale in size of  is fed through the bottom of the retort and it moves upwards through the retort by the solids pump (known as as a &quot;rock pump&quot;). Hot gases, generated by internal combustion or circulated through the top of the retort, decompose the oil shale while descending.22 The pyrolysis occurs at the temperature of  to .23 Shale oil vapors and gases are carried out from the retort at the bottom. Part of the gases is recirculated for pyrolysis and fueling combustion, while other part could be used as product gas. The spent shale is removed from the top of the retort. After cooling in a water it is conveyed to the waste disposal.24
Advantages
The Union retort design has several advantages. The reducing atmosphere in the retort allows the removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds through the formation of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Oil vapors are cooled by the raw oil, thus minimizing polymer formation among the hydrocarbon fractions.25
