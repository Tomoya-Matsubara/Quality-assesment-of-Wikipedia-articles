History
To date two ships of the Royal New Zealand Navy have been named &quot;Monowai&quot;
1939-1946 It was taken over by the Royal Navy in 1939 and converted to an armed merchant cruiser and later again to a troop ship. As an armed merchant cruiser, was attacked by the Japanese submarine I20 in 1942. As a troop ship, was the only New Zealand ship to take part in the Normandy Landings in 1944. The ship was returned to its owners in 1946.
1977-1998 In 1977 the RNZN took over the former Pacific Island ferry &quot;Moana Roa&quot; as a replacement for WWII era HMNZS Lachlan. The ship was converted in the United Kingdom and returned to NZ for service as the &quot;ghost of the coast&quot;.
In 1985 Monawai deployed to Fiji with a platoon of naval gunners who were to act as a landing party in the event that the coup became bloody.
In 1994 Monawai again entered the news, when the ship rescued a number of people from a yachts in distress during a storm.
The ship was decommissioned in 1998 and sailed for the UK later that year for refitting as a liner. The project never proceeded and it is likely the ship will be scrapped.
