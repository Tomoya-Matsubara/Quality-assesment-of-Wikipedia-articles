 Gibraltar 1 is the specimen name of a Neanderthal skull found in Forbes' Quarry at Gibraltar in 1848, by a Lieutenant Flint, a British officer with the Royal Navy. It has been dated to between 30 thousand to 50 thousand years old.1 The skull is that of an adult woman, with typical Neanderthal features.2 While the skull was one of the first to be found, it was also possibly from one of the last surviving Neanderthal populations.3 Being found more than ten years before the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species however, the significance of the find was not understood at the time, and the skull simply labelled as &quot;an ancient human&quot;. It was later examined by both Darwin and Thomas Huxley, who concluded the skull was that of an extinct human species.
A cast of the skull is now at the Gibraltar Museum - the original is kept by the Natural History Museum in London
