Dravidian people refers to populations who speak languages belonging to the Dravidian language family. Populations of speakers are found mostly in Southern India and some minor populations are found in Brahui-speaking parts of Pakistan, Kurukh-speaking parts of Bangladesh, and Tamil-speaking parts of Sri Lanka.
Concept of the Dravidian people
The term Dravidian is taken from the Sanskrit term Dravida. It was adopted following the publication of Robert Caldwell's Comparative grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian family of languages (1856); a publication which established the language grouping as one of the major language groups of the world.
However over seventy three languages are presently listed as Dravidian in the study. Further the languages are spread out and cover parts of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as is indicated in the study.
The identification of the Dravidian people as a separate race arose from the realization by 19th-century Western scholars that there existed a group of languages spoken by people in the south of India, which very different to the Indo-Aryan languages prevalent in the north of the country. Because of this, it was said by Western researchers in India that the generally darker-skinned Dravidian speakers constituted a genetically distinct race even though they posess Caucasiod skull-structure. perhaops to enforce the British &quot;divide and conquer&quot;, Dravidians were envisaged as early inhabitants of India who had been partially displaced and assimilated by Aryan language speaking populations.
The vedic legends speak of battle between Asuras and Devas. It is generally assumed that this was a reflection of actual battle for supermacy that took place when Aryans started entering the Indian sub-continent. However the Asuras are actually the Iranians and the Devas are the Indo-Aryans. The Dasarajna war has been completly misunderstood as some racial violence from Aryans to non-Aryans. It was the Indo-Aryans who declared that they are the true Aryans while the Iranians were not. This battles eventually ended with Aryans, led by King Sudas ( a Sudra king) establishing supermacy all over India and the Iranians moving onto what today is the Iranian Subcontinent.
Historical evidence does not point to the fact that Dravidians were the race who had created the Indus Valley Civilisation. It remained unanswered why there were Aryan symbols that appear on the Indus Valley seals (e.g. swastika.) However, even thoug the Aryan langauges are said to belong to the Indo-European family and not of the Dravidian family, the root words are almost all the same. For example, 'land' is des, 'language' is basa and 'bread' is chapaati.
Racial classifications
Carleton S. Coon (Ph.D Harvad University), in his book he published in 1969, &quot;The Living Races of Man,&quot; he said, &quot;India is the easternmost outpost of the Caucasian racial region.&quot;
However Richard McCulloch (who advocated Racial separatism) said that only the people of Central India belong to the Dravidic race while the South Indains are Veddoid. 1 SO here the term Dravidian becomes used for the Central Indians and not the South Indians.
In 440 BCE, Herodotus considered Dravidians to be a type of Ethiopian called the &quot;Eastern Ethiopian&quot; in contrast with the standard Ethiopian which he called a &quot;Western Ethiopian&quot;.2 In Herodotus' work The History of Herodotus he said, &quot;The eastern Ethiopians... They differed in nothing from the other Ethiopians, save in their language, and the character of their hair.&quot;3
In 1937, Bertram Thomas, a scientist who practiced craniofacial anthropometry,4 claimed that Dravidians are descended from a protonegroid belt that spanned from Africa, the Arabian peninsula and South India.5 Later, through the evolutionary process, this protonegroid belt gave rise to the &quot;Hamitic race&quot; in Africa, an intermediate people in the Arabian peninsula and Dravidians in India.6
In 1972, W. E. B. Du Bois, a sociologist and historian, explained the Dravidians as, &quot;...pre-Dravidians, a taller larger type of Negro; then the Dravidians, Negroes with some mixture of Mongoloid and later Caucasoid stocks.&quot;7
In 1985, Wayne B. Chandler, anthropologist and historian, explained that orignally there were two constituents of the &quot;Black race&quot; in India which populated the whole region: the &quot;Ethiopian Negrito&quot; and the &quot;Proto-Australoid&quot;.8 The Ethiopian Negrito was the first migratory group that once inhabited all of India,9 Second, the Proto-Australoid migrated into India and mixed with the Negritos.10 Later, there was &quot;a mix of Black [Negritos and Proto-Australoids] and Mongoloid races, which occur[ed] in Kannada, Tamil and Malayan regions&quot;. After this an invading party of multiracials who were a &quot;mix of Black and Caucasian races&quot; mixed with the previous Mongoloid and Negroid multiracials. The combination of these mixes &quot;formed the Dravidians&quot;.11
In 1999, Professor Uthaya Naidu, an Indian historian12, classified the &quot;Sudroid race&quot; as including Dravidians, Kolarians, Dalits and Adivasis.13 He described Sudroids, specifically Dravidians, as &quot;Negroid&quot; and &quot;black&quot;.14
In 2003, Kethesh Loganathan, a sociologist specializing in developing countries15, stated that the &quot;black Dravidian sub-race is the same as the black East African sub-race&quot;.16
According to a prominent Hindu website, most Dravidians or South Indians are physically not very different from the Indo-Aryans of North India. Both the Aryans and the Dravidians belong to the Mediterranean sub-branch of the Caucasoid race.17

Genetic classifications
The genetic views on race differ in their classification of Dravidians. Most modern anthropologists, however, reject the genetic existence of race,18 like Richard Lewontin who states that &quot;every human genome differs from every other&quot;, showing the impossibility of using genetics to define races. (Biology as Ideology, page 68).19 According to population geneticist L.L. Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford, whose work was done in the 1980s almost all Indians are genetically similar to Caucasian, but Lewontin rejects the label Caucasian. Cavalli-Sforza found that Indians are about three times closer to West Europeans than to East Asians.20 Dr. Eduardas Valaitis, in 2006, found that India is genetically closest to East and Southeast Asians with little genetic similarity to Europeans; that said he also found that India could be considered very distinct from other regions.21 Genetic anthropologist Stanley Marion Garn considered in the 1960s that the entirety of the Indian Subcontinent to be a &quot;race&quot; genetically distinct from other populations.2223 Others, such as Lynn B. Jorde and Stephen P. Wooding, claim South Indians are genetic intermediaries between Europeans and East Asians.242526
Recent studies of the distribution of alleles on the Y chromosome,27 microsatellite DNA,28 and mitochondrial DNA29 in India have cast overwhelmingly strong doubt for a biological Dravidian &quot;race&quot; distinct from non-Dravidians in the Indian subcontinent.
This doubtfulness applies to both paternal and maternal descent; however, it does not preclude the possibility of distinctive South Indian ancestries associated with Dravidian languages.30
Linguistic classifications
The best known Dravidian languages are: Tamil (&lt;U+0BA4&gt;&lt;U+0BAE&gt;&lt;U+0BBF&gt;&lt;U+0BB4&gt;&lt;U+0BCD&gt;),Kannada (&lt;U+0C95&gt;&lt;U+0CA8&gt;&lt;U+0CCD&gt;&lt;U+0CA8&gt;&lt;U+0CA1&gt;), Malayalam (&lt;U+0D2E&gt;&lt;U+0D32&gt;&lt;U+0D2F&gt;&lt;U+0D3E&gt;&lt;U+0D33&gt;&lt;U+0D02&gt;), Telugu (&lt;U+0C24&gt;&lt;U+0C46&gt;&lt;U+0C32&gt;&lt;U+0C41&gt;&lt;U+0C17&gt;&lt;U+0C41&gt;), and Tulu (&lt;U+0CA4&gt;&lt;U+0CC1&gt;&lt;U+0CB3&gt;&lt;U+0CC1&gt;). Notably one Dravidian language, Brahui (&lt;U+0628&gt;&lt;U+0631&gt;&lt;U+0648&gt;&lt;U+06C1&gt;&lt;U+06CC&gt;), is spoken in Pakistan and minor tribal languages are used in Nepal and Bangladesh, perhaps hinting at the language family's wider distribution prior to the spread of the Indo-Aryan languages, though relatively recent migrations of populations have also been proposed.
Early arrival theory
 Kamil V. Zvelebil has suggested that the proto-Dravidians of the Indian subcontinent arrived from the Middle East, and may have been related to the Elamites,31 whose language some propose be categorized along with the Dravidian languages as part of a larger Elamo-Dravidian language family. However, S.A. Starostin has disputed the existence of an Elamo-Dravidian language family.
According to a view put forward by geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza in the book The History and Geography of Human Genes, the Dravidians were preceded in the subcontinent by an Austro-Asiatic people, and followed by Indo-European-speaking migrants sometime later. The original inhabitants may be identified with the speakers of the Munda languages, which are unrelated to either Indo-Aryan or Dravidian languages. However, the Munda languages, as a subgroup of the larger Austro-Asiatic language family, are known to have arrived in the Indian subcontinent from the east, possibly from the area that is now southwestern China, so any genetic similarity between the present-day speakers of the Munda languages and the &quot;original inhabitants&quot; of India is likely to be due to assimilation of the natives by Southeast Asian immigrants speaking a proto-Munda language.
Some linguists believe that Dravidian-speaking people were spread throughout the Indian subcontinent before the Aryans settled there. In this view the early Indus Valley civilization (Harappa and Mohenjo Daro) is often identified as having been Dravidian10. According to them it is now considered likely that the collapse of Indus Valley civilization was caused by environmental change (drought) which then encouraged the migration of the nomadic Indo-Aryans into the area. In that perspective it is therefore more likely that the Dravidian speakers of South India were already living in the region and were merely one of the groups little affected by the initial Indo-Aryan migration.
Late arrival theory
Some scholars like J. Bloch and M. Witzel believe that the Dravidians moved into an already Indo-Aryan speaking area after the oldest parts of the Rig Veda were already composed (see Bryant 2001: chapter 5)
This theory might be supported if a higher antiquity of the Indo-Aryan languages could be established. However, since this theory is mainly a linguistic hypothesis, the Dravidian influence on Aryan languages must not necessarily be equated to a movement of populations.
Prominent Dravidian linguistic subgroups
There are three subgroups within the Dravidian linguistic family: North Dravidian, Central Dravidian and South Dravidian matching for the most part the corresponding regions in the Indian subcontinent.
Brahui : Brahuis belong to North-Dravidian subgroup. They are found in Balochistan province of Pakistan.
Gonds: A prominent group of Dravidian speaking Tribal people the Central region of India.
Kannadiga : These people belong to South-Dravidian subgroup. Mostly found in Karnataka , Tamil nadu and Maharashtra.
Kurukh : These people belong to North-Dravidian subgroup. Found in India and Bangladesh. It is the only language indigenous in Bangladesh.
Malayali : The people of Kerala belong to South-Dravidian linguistic subgroup.
Tamil : These people belong to South-Dravidian linguistic subgroup. Mostly found in Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia.
Telugu : These people belong to South Dravidian subgroup (formerly classified with the Central Dravidian but now more specifically in the South Dravidian II or South Central Dravidian inner branch of the South Dravidian (Krishnamurti 2003:p19)). Mostly found in Andhra Pradesh also in Orissa and Tamil Nadu.
Geographic distribution
Political ramifications
The concept of a Dravidian race has affected thinking in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh about racial and regional differences.
India
Some Indians believe that the British Raj exaggerated differences between northern and southern Indians beyond linguistic differences to help sustain their control of India. The British Raj ended in 1947, yet all discussion of Aryan or Dravidian &quot;races&quot; remains highly controversial in India. It is now widely believed that the British only used this as their 'Divide and rule' blueprint for taking over the region.32The British also used this &quot;theory&quot; of perceived differences between so-called &quot;Aryans&quot; and &quot;Dravidians&quot; to propagate racist beliefs concerning the inherent &quot;inferiority&quot; of the Dravidians when compared to the &quot;Aryans&quot;, thus justifying their colonization of South Asia (since the British identified themselves as &quot;Aryans&quot;)33
It has also informed aspects of radical politics (e.g. Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, DK, AIADMK, VC, etc.) in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu nationalistic politics, which has at times appropriated the claim that Dravidians are the earliest inhabitants of India in order to argue that other populations such as the locally or ritually dominant were oppressive interlopers from which the Dravidians should liberate themselves.
Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, the current ethnic conflict and the civil war are further complicated by the view that the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils belong to two different ethnic and linguistic families. Sinhalese (like Dhivehi) is an Indo-Aryan language that exists in the southern part of South Asia.
