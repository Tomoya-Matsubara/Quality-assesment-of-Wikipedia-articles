The Kushan Empire (c. 1st–3rd centuries) was a state that at its cultural zenith, circa 105–250 CE, extended from what is now Tajikistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan and down into the Ganges river valley in northern India. The empire was created by the Kushan tribe of the Yuezhi confederation, believed to be Indo-European people2 from the eastern Tarim Basin, China, possibly related to the Tocharians. They had diplomatic contacts with Rome, Persia and China, and for several centuries were at the center of exchange between the East and the West.
Origins
Chinese sources describe the Guishuang (Ch: &lt;U+8CB4&gt;&lt;U+971C&gt;), i.e. the &quot;Kushans&quot;, as one of the five aristocratic tribes of the Yuezhi, also spelled Yueh-chi,3 (Ch: &lt;U+6708&gt;&lt;U+6C0F&gt;), a loose confederation of supposedly Indo-European peoples.4 The Yuezhi are also generally considered as the easternmost speakers of Indo-European languages, who had been living in the arid grasslands of eastern Central Asia, in modern-day Xinjiang and Gansu, possibly speaking versions of the Tocharian language, until they were driven west by the Xiongnu in 176–160 BCE. The five tribes constituting the Yuezhi are known in Chinese history as Xi&lt;U+016B&gt;m&lt;U+00EC&gt; (Ch: &lt;U+4F11&gt;&lt;U+5BC6&gt;), Guishuang (Ch: &lt;U+8CB4&gt;&lt;U+971C&gt;), Shuangmi (Ch: &lt;U+96D9&gt;&lt;U+9761&gt;), Xidun (Ch: &lt;U+80B8&gt;&lt;U+9813&gt;), and D&lt;U+016B&gt;m&lt;U+00EC&gt; (Ch: &lt;U+90FD&gt;&lt;U+5BC6&gt;).
Historian John Keay contextualizes the movements of the Kushan within a larger setting of mass migrations taking place in the region:   
The Yuezhi reached the Hellenic kingdom of Greco-Bactria, in the Bactrian territory (northernmost Afghanistan and Uzbekistan) around 135 BCE. The displaced Greek dynasties resettled to the southeast in areas of the Hindu Kush and the Indus basin (in present day Pakistan), occupying the western part of the Indo-Greek Kingdom.
Early Kushans
 Some traces remain of the presence of the Kushan in the area of Bactria and Sogdiana. Archaeological structures are known in Takht-I-Sangin, Surkh Kotal (a monumental temple), and in the palace of Khalchayan. Various sculptures and friezes are known, representing horse-riding archers5, and significantly men with artificially deformed skulls, such as the Kushan prince of Khalchayan6 (a practice well attested in nomadic Central Asia). On the ruins of ancient Hellenistic cities such as Ai-Khanoum, the Kushans are known to have built fortresses. The earliest documented ruler, and the first one to proclaim himself as a Kushan ruler was Heraios. He calls himself a &quot;Tyrant&quot; on his coins, and also exhibits skull deformation. He may have been an ally of the Greeks, and he shared the same style of coinage. Heraios may have been the father of the first Kushan emperor Kujula Kadphises.
A multi-cultural Empire
In the following century, the Guishuang (Ch: &lt;U+8CB4&gt;&lt;U+971C&gt;) gained prominence over the other Yuezhi tribes, and welded them into a tight confederation under yabgu (Commander) Kujula Kadphises. The name Guishuang was adopted in the West and modified into Kushan to designate the confederation, although the Chinese continued to call them Yuezhi.
 Gradually wresting control of the area from the Scythian tribes, the Kushans expanded south into the region traditionally known as Gandhara (An area lying primarily in Pakistan's Pothowar, and Northwest Frontier Provinces region but going in an arc to include Kabul valley and part of Qandahar in Afghanistan) and established twin capitals near present-day Kabul and Peshawar then known as Kapisa and Pushklavati respectively.
The Kushan writing system used the Greek alphabet, with the addition of the letter Sho.
Asia in 200 CE (showing the Kushan Empire and its neighbors.
The Kushans adopted elements of the Hellenistic culture of Bactria. They adapted the Greek alphabet (often corrupted) to suit their own language (with the additional development of the letter &lt;U+00DE&gt; &quot;sh&quot;, as in &quot;Kushan&quot;) and soon began minting coinage on the Greek model. On their coins they used Greek language legends combined with Pali legends (in the Kharoshthi script), until the first few years of the reign of Kanishka. After that date, they used Kushan language legends (in an adapted Greek script), combined with legends in Greek (Greek script) and legends in Pali (Kharoshthi script).
The Kushans are believed to have been predominantly Zoroastrian and later Buddhist as well. However, from the time of Wima Takto, many Kushans started adopting aspects of Indian culture like the other nomadic groups who had invaded India, principally the Royal clans of Gujjars. Like the Egyptians they absorbed the strong remnants of the Greek Culture of the Hellenistic Kingdoms, becoming at least partly Hellenised. The first great Kushan emperor Wima Kadphises may have embraced Saivism, as surmised by coins minted during the period. The following Kushan emperors represented a wide variety of faiths including Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and possibly Saivism.
The rule of the Kushans linked the seagoing trade of the Indian Ocean with the commerce of the Silk Road through the long-civilized Indus Valley. At the height of the dynasty, the Kushans loosely oversaw a territory that extended to the Aral Sea through present-day Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan into northern India.
The loose unity and comparative peace of such a vast expanse encouraged long-distance trade, brought Chinese silks to Rome, and created strings of flourishing urban centers.
Territorial expansion
  Direct archaeological evidence of a Kushan rule of long duration is basically available in an area stretching from Surkh Kotal, Begram, the summer capital of the Kushans, Peshawar the capital under Kanishka I, Taxila and Mathura, the winter capital of the Kushans.7
Other areas of probable rule include Khwarezm (Russian archaeological findings)8 Kausambi (excavations of the Allahabad University),9 Sanchi and Sarnath (inscriptions with names and dates of Kushan kings),10 Malwa and Maharashtra,11 Orissa (imitation of Kushan coins, and large Kushan hoards).12
The recently discovered Rabatak inscription tends to confirm large Kushan dominions in the heartland of India. The lines 4 to 7 of the inscription13 describe the cities which were under the rule of Kanishka, among which six names are identifiable: Ujjain, Kundina, Saketa, Kausambi, Pataliputra, and Champa (although the text is not clear whether Champa was a possession of Kanishka or just beyond it).141516
Northward, in the 2nd century CE, the Kushans under Kanishka made various forays into the Tarim Basin, seemingly the original ground of their ancestors the Yuezhi, where they had various contacts with the Chinese. Both archaeological findins and literary evidence suggest Kushan rule, in Kashgar, Yarkand and Khotan.17
As late as the 3rd century CE, decorated coins of Huvishka were dedicated at Bodh Gaya together with other gold offerings under the &quot;Enlightenment Throne&quot; of the Buddha, suggesting direct Kushan influence in the area during that period.18
Main Kushan rulers
Kujula Kadphises (30&lt;U+2013&gt;80)
 According to the Hou Hanshu: &quot;the prince (xihou) of Guishuang (Badakhshan and the adjoining territories north of the Oxus), named Kujula Kadphises (Ch: &lt;U+4E18&gt;&lt;U+5C31&gt;&lt;U+5374&gt;, &quot;Qiujiuque&quot;) attacked and exterminated the four other princes (xihou). He set himself up as king of a kingdom called Guishuang.&quot;19
He invaded Anxi (Parthia) and took the Gaofu (Kabul) region. He also defeated the whole of the kingdoms of Puda, and Jibin (Kapisha-Gandhara). Qiujiuque (Kujula Kadphises) was more than eighty years old when he died.&quot;
These conquests probably took place sometime between 45 and 60, and laid the basis for the Kushan Empire which was rapidly expanded by his descendants.
Kujula issued an extensive series of coins and fathered at least two sons,  (who is known from only two inscriptions, especially the Rabatak inscription, and apparently never have ruled), and seemingly Vima Taktu.
Kujula Kadphises was the great grandfather of Kanishka.
Vima Taktu (80&lt;U+2013&gt;105)
 Vima Takt[u] (or Tak[to], Ancient Chinese: &lt;U+960E&gt;&lt;U+818F&gt;&lt;U+73CD&gt; Yangaozhen ) is not mentioned in the Rabatak inscription (Sadashkana is instead. See also the reference to Sims-William&lt;U+2019&gt;s article below). He was the predecessor of Vima Kadphises, and Kanishka I. He expanded the Kushan Empire into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent. The Hou Hanshu says:
&quot;His [Kujula Kadphises'] son, Yangaozhen (Vima Taktu), became king in his place. He conquered Tianzhu (Northwestern India) and installed a General to supervise and lead it. The Yuezhi then became extremely rich. All the kingdoms call [their king] the Guishuang (Kushan) king, but the Han call them by their original name, Da Yuezhi.&quot;20
Vima Kadphises (105&lt;U+2013&gt;127)
 Vima Kadphises (Kushan language: &lt;U+039F&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt; &lt;U+039A&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;) was a Kushan emperor from around 90&lt;U+2013&gt;100 CE, the son of Sadashkana and the grandson of Kujula Kadphises, and the father of Kanishka I, as detailed by the Rabatak inscription.
Vima Kadphises added to the Kushan territory by his conquests in Afghanistan and north-west India. He issued an extensive series of coins and inscriptions. He was the first to introduce gold coinage in India, in addition to the existing copper and silver coinage.
Kanishka I (127&lt;U+2013&gt;147)
Kanishka I.
The rule of Kanishka, fifth Kushan king, who flourished for at least 28 years from c. 127. Upon his accession, Kanishka ruled a huge territory (virtually all of northern India), south to Ujjain and Kundina and east beyond Pataliputra, according to the Rabatak inscription:
&quot;In the year one, it has been proclaimed unto India, unto the whole realm of the governing class, including Koonadeano (Kaundinya&lt; Kundina) and the city of Ozeno (Ozene, Ujjain) and the city of Zageda (Saketa) and the city of Kozambo (Kausambi) and the city of Palabotro (Pataliputra) and so long unto (i.e. as far as) the city of Ziri-tambo (Sri-Champa).&quot; Rabatak inscription, Lines 4&lt;U+2013&gt;6.
 His territory was administered from two capitals: Purushapura (now Peshawar in northern Pakistan) and Mathura, in northern India. He is also credited (along with Raja Dab) for building the massive, ancient Fort at Bathinda (Qila Mubarak), in the modern city of Bathinda, Indian Punjab.
The Kushans also had a summer capital in Bagram (then known as Kapisa), where the &quot;Begram Treasure&quot;, comprising works of art from Greece to China, has been found. According to the Rabatak inscription, Kanishka was the son of Vima Kadphises, the grandson of Sadashkana, and the great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises. Kanishka&lt;U+2019&gt;s era is now generally accepted to have begun in 127 on the basis of Harry Falk&lt;U+2019&gt;s ground-breaking research.2122 Kanishka&lt;U+2019&gt;s era was used as a calendar reference by the Kushans for about a century, until the decline of the Kushan realm.
V&lt;U+0101&gt;sishka
V&lt;U+0101&gt;sishka was a Kushan emperor, who seems to have a short reign following Kanishka. His rule is recorded as far south as Sanchi (near Vidisa), where several inscriptions in his name have been found, dated to the year 22 (The Sanchi inscription of &quot;Vaksushana&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; i. e. Vasishka Kushana) and year 28 (The Sanchi inscription of Vasaska &lt;U+2013&gt; i. e. Vasishka) of the Kanishka era.
Huvishka.
Huvishka (140&lt;U+2013&gt;183)
Huvishka (Kushan: &lt;U+039F&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03F8&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;, &quot;Ooishki&quot;) was a Kushan emperor from the death of Kanishka (assumed on the best evidence available to be in 140 CE) until the succession of Vasudeva I about forty years later. His rule was a period of retrenchment and consolidation for the Empire. In particular he devoted time and effort early in his reign to the exertion of greater control over the city of Mathura.
Vasudeva I (191&lt;U+2013&gt;225)
 Vasudeva I (Kushan: &lt;U+0392&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B6&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt; &quot;Bazodeo&quot;, Chinese: &lt;U+6CE2&gt;&lt;U+8ABF&gt; &quot;Bodiao&quot;) was the last of the &quot;Great Kushans.&quot; Named inscriptions dating from year 64 to 98 of Kanishka&lt;U+2019&gt;s era suggest his reign extended from at least 191 to 225 CE. He was the last great Kushan emperor, and the end of his rule coincides with the invasion of the Sassanids as far as northwestern India, and the establishment of the Indo-Sassanids or Kushanshahs from around 240 CE.
Kushan deities
   The Kushan religious pantheon is extremely varied, as revealed by their coins and their seals, on which more than 30 different gods appear, belonging to the Hellenistic, the Iranian, and to a lesser extent the Indian world. Greek deities, with Greek names are represented on early coins. During Kanishka's reign, the language of the coinage changes to Bactrian (though it remained in Greek script for all kings). After Huvishka, only two divinities appear on the coins: Ardoxsho and '' Oesho '' (see details below).
Representation of entities from Greek mythology and Hellenistic syncretism are:
&lt;U+0397&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; (Helios), &lt;U+0397&gt;&lt;U+03C6&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; (Hephaistos), &lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt; (Selene), &lt;U+0391&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; (Anemos). Further, the coins of Huvishka also portray two demi-gods: erakilo Heracles, and sarapo Sarapis.
The Indic entities represented on coinage include:
&lt;U+0392&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03BF&gt; (boddo, Buddha)

The Iranic entities depicted on coinage include:

Two copper coins of Huvishka bear a 'Ganesa' legend, but instead of depicting the typical theriomorphic figure of Ganesha, have a figure of an archer holding a full-length bow with string inwards and an arrow. This is typically a depiction of Rudra, but in the case of these two coins is generally assumed to represent Shiva.

The Kushans and Buddhism
An early Mahayana Buddhist triad. From left to right, a Kushan devotee, the Bodhisattva Maitreya, the Buddha, the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, and a Buddhist monk. 2nd-3rd century, Gandhara.
Cultural exchanges also flourished, encouraging the development of Greco-Buddhism, a fusion of Hellenistic and Buddhist cultural elements, that was to expand into central and northern Asia as Mahayana Buddhism.
Kanishka is renowned in Buddhist tradition for having convened a great Buddhist council in Kashmir. Kanishka also had the original Gandhari vernacular, or Prakrit, Buddhist texts translated into the language of Sanskrit. Along with the Indian emperors Ashoka and Harsha Vardhana and the Indo-Greek king Menander I (Milinda), Kanishka is considered by Buddhism as one of its greatest benefactors.
Kushan art
The art and culture of Gandhara, at the crossroads of the Kushan hegemony, are the best known expressions of Kushan influences to Westerners. Several direct depictions of Kushans are known from Gandhara, where they are represented with a tunic, belt and trousers and play the role of devotees to the Buddha, as well as the Bodhisattva and future Buddha Maitreya.
In the iconography, they are never associated however with the very Hellenistic &quot;Standing Buddha&quot; statues (See image), which might therefore correspond to an earlier historical period. The style of these friezes incorporating Kushan devotees is already strongly Indianized, quite remote from earlier Hellenistic depictions of the Buddha:

Contacts with Rome
 Several Roman sources describe the visit of ambassadors from the Kings of Bactria and India during the 2nd century, probably referring to the Kushans.
Historia Augusta, speaking of Emperor Hadrian (117–138) tells:
&quot;Reges Bactrianorum legatos ad eum, amicitiae petendae causa, supplices miserunt&quot;
&quot;The kings of the Bactrians sent supplicant ambassadors to him, to seek his friendship.&quot;
 Also in 138, according to Aurelius Victor (Epitome&lt;U+201A&gt; XV, 4), and Appian (Praef., 7), Antoninus Pius, successor to Hadrian, received some Indian, Bactrian (Kushan) and Hyrcanian ambassadors.
The Chinese Historical Chronicle of the Hou Hanshu also describes the exchange of goods between northwestern India and the Roman Empire at that time: &quot;To the west (Tiazhu, northwestern India) communicates with Da Qin (the Roman Empire). Precious things from Da Qin can be found there, as well as fine cotton cloths, excellent wool carpets, perfumes of all sorts, sugar loaves, pepper, ginger, and black salt.&quot;
The summer capital of the Kushan in Begram has yielded a considerable amount of goods imported from the Roman Empire, in particular various types of glassware.

Contacts with China
 During the 1st and 2nd century, the Kushan Empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the Tarim Basin, their original grounds, putting them at the center of the profitable Central Asian commerce with the Roman Empire. They are related to have collaborated militarily with the Chinese against nomadic incursion, particularly when they collaborated with the Chinese general Ban Chao against the Sogdians in 84, when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of Kashgar. Around 85, they also assisted the Chinese general in an attack on Turfan, east of the Tarim Basin.
In recognition for their support to the Chinese, the Kushans requested, but were denied, a Han princess, even after they had sent presents to the Chinese court. In retaliation, they marched on Ban Chao in 86 with a force of 70,000, but, exhausted by the expedition, were finally defeated by the smaller Chinese force. The Yuezhi retreated and paid tribute to the Chinese Empire during the reign of the Chinese emperor Han He (89–106).
 Later, around 116, the Kushans under Kanishka established a kingdom centered on Kashgar, also taking control of Khotan and Yarkand, which were Chinese dependencies in the Tarim Basin, modern Xinjiang. They introduced the Brahmi script, the Indian Prakrit language for administration, and expanded the influence of Greco-Buddhist art which developed into Serindian art.
The Kushans are again recorded to have sent presents to the Chinese court in 158–159 during the reign of the Chinese emperor Han Huan.
Following these interactions, cultural exhanges further increased, and Kushan Buddhist missionaries, such as Lokaksema, became active in the Chinese capital cities of Loyang and sometimes Nanjing, where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They were the first recorded promoters of Hinayana and Mahayana scriptures in China, greatly contributing to the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism.
Decline
  After the death of Vasudeva I in 225, the Kushan empire split into western and eastern halves. The Western Kushans (in Afghanistan) were soon subjugated by the Persian Sassanid Empire and lost Bactria and other territories. In 248 they were defeated again by the Persians, who deposed the Western dynasty and replaced them with Persian vassals known as the Kushanshas (or Indo-Sassanids).
The Eastern Kushan kingdom was based in the Punjab. Around 270 their territories on the Gangetic plain became independent under local dynasties such as the Yaudheyas. Then in the mid 4th century they were subjugated by the Gupta Empire under Samudragupta.
In 360 a Kushan vassal named Kidara overthrew the old Kushan dynasty and established the Kidarite Kingdom. The Kushan style of Kidarite coins indicates they considered themselves as Kushans. The Kidarite seem to have been rather prosperous, although on a smaller scale than their Kushan predecessors.
These remnants of the Kushan empire were ultimately wiped out in the 5th century by the invasions of the White Huns, and later the expansion of Islam.
In fiction
The Kushan Empire was used to represent a dystopian demonic empire within the hugely popular Berserk manga. Its culture is based on that of ancient and medieval India, which was the cultural centre of the real Kushan Empire, including Indian weapons such as chakrams, katars and urumis, and martial arts similar to Kalarippayattu, but adapted for the nihilistic setting. In this fictional setting it is ruled by the Emperor Ganishka, a name based upon the real Kushan Emperor Kanishka.

&quot;The Rabatak inscription claims that in the year 1 Kanishka I's authority was proclaimed in India, in all the satrapies and in different cities like Koonadeano (Kundina), Ozeno (Ujjain), Kozambo (Kausambi), Zagedo (Saketa), Palabotro (Pataliputra) and Ziri-Tambo (Janjgir-Champa). These cities lay to the east and south of Mathura, up to which locality Wima had already carried his victorious arm. Therefore they must have been captured or subdued by Kanishka I himself.&quot; &quot;Ancient Indian Inscriptions&quot;, S. R. Goyal, p. 93.
