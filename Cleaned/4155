The Siege of H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen (Fr: Huningue) occurred from 27 November 1796 to 1 February 1797, resulting in the Austrian capture of the city from the French. H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen is located in Alsace-Lorraine on the west bank of the Rhine river. It is approximately  north of the Swiss city of Basel. The fortress guarding the crossing of the river was located approximately  from the village. During the time of this siege, the village was part of the Canton of Basel City and the fortress lay in area contested between the German states and France.
At the end of the summer's fighting in 1796, the Austrian force under command of Archduke Charles had succeeded in pushing the French back to the Rhine. With the conclusion of the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October, the French army withdrew south and west toward the Rhine. Forces commanded by Jean Charles Abbatucci and Pierre Marie Barth&lt;U+00E9&gt;lemy Ferino provided the rear guard support and the main force retreated across the Rhine into France. The French retained retained control of the fortifications at Kehl and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen and, more importantly, the t&lt;U+00EA&gt;te-du-ponts of the star-shaped fortresses where the bridges crossed the Rhine. The French commander, Jean Victor Moreau, offered an armistice to the Austrian commander, which the archduke was inclined to accept. He wanted to secure the Rhine crossings and then send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged Mantua; an armistice with Moreau would allow him to do that. However, his brother, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice, forcing Charles to order simultaneous sieges at Kehl and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen. These tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter. He himself moved north with the bulk of his force to invest the larger crossing at Kehl, and instructed Karl Aloys zu F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg to conduct the siege in the south by Basel. While the Austrians besieged these Rhine crossings, Moreau had sufficient surplus troops to send 14Â demi-brigades (approximately 12,000 troops) into Italy to assist in the siege at Mantua.1
The Habsburg force, under command of Karl Aloys zu F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg, initiated the siege within days of the Austrian victory at the Battle of Schliengen. Most of the siege ran concurrently with the siege at Kehl, which concluded on 9 January 1797. Troops engaged at Kehl marched to H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen in preparation for a major assault, but the French defenders capitulated on 1 February 1797. The French commander, Jean Charles Abbatucci, was killed in the early days of the fighting, and replaced by Georges Joseph Dufour.
Background
At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795 the two sides called a truce.2 This agreement lasted until 20 May 1796 when the Austrians announced that it would end on 31 May.3 The Coalition Army of the Lower Rhine counted 90,000 troops. The 20,000-man right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River, observing the French bridgehead at D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf. The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress counted 10,000 more. The remainder of the Imperial and Coalition army was posted on the west bank behind the Nahe. Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser led the 80,000-strong Army of the Upper Rhine. Its right wing occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Szt&lt;U+00E1&gt;ray, Michael von Fr&lt;U+00F6&gt;hlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond&lt;U+00E9&gt; guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland. The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn. However, after news arrived in Vienna of Bonaparte's successes, Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25,000 reinforcements. Reconsidering the situation, the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground.4
On the French side, the 80,000-man Army of Sambre-et-Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel. On the army's left flank, Jean Baptiste Kl&lt;U+00E9&gt;ber had 22,000 troops in an entrenched camp at D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf. The right wing of the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle was positioned behind the Rhine from H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen northward, its center was along the Queich River near Landau and its left wing extended west toward Saarbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;cken.5 Pierre Marie Barth&lt;U+00E9&gt;lemy Ferino led Moreau's right wing, Louis Desaix commanded the center and Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr directed the left wing. Ferino's wing consisted of three infantry and cavalry divisions under Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Antoine Louis Bourcier, Henri Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Delaborde. Desaix's command counted three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy, Antoine Guillaume Delmas and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles. Saint-Cyr's wing had two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme, and Alexandre Camille Taponier.6
The French grand plan called for two French armies to press against the flanks of the northern armies in the German states while simultaneously a third army approached Vienna through Italy. Jourdan's army would push south from D&lt;U+00FC&gt;sseldorf, hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves, which would allow Moreau&lt;U+2019&gt;s army an easier crossing. According to plan, Jourdan&lt;U+2019&gt;s army feinted toward Mannheim, and Charles quickly reapportioned his troops. Moreau&lt;U+2019&gt;s army attacked the bridgehead at Kehl, which was guarded by 7,000 imperial troops&lt;U+2014&gt;troops recruited that spring from the Swabian circle polities, inexperienced and untrained&lt;U+2014&gt;which amazingly held the bridgehead for several hours, but then retreated toward Rastatt. Moreau reinforced the bridgehead with his forward guard, and his troops poured into Baden unhindered. In the south, by Basel, Ferino&lt;U+2019&gt;s column moved speedily across the river and proceeded up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline, toward Lake Constance and into the southern end of the Black Forest. Anxious that his supply lines would be overextended, Charles began a retreat to the east.7
At this point, the inherent jealousies and competition between generals came into play. Moreau could have joined up with Jourdan&lt;U+2019&gt;s army in the north, but did not; he proceeded eastward, pushing Charles into Bavaria, and Jourdan pushed eastward, pushing Wartensleben&lt;U+2019&gt;s autonomous corps into the Ernestine duchies.8 On either side, the union of two armies&lt;U+2014&gt;Wartensleben&lt;U+2019&gt;s with Charles&lt;U+2019&gt; or Jourdan&lt;U+2019&gt;s with Moreau&lt;U+2019&gt;s&lt;U+2014&gt;could have crushed the opposition. Wartensleben and Charles united first, and the tide turned against the French. With 25,000 of his best troops, the archduke crossed to the north bank of the Danube at Regensburg and moved north to join his colleague Wartensleben.9
There followed a summer of strategic retreats, flanking, and reflanking maneuvers. Once Charles and Wartensleben's forces were reunited, their combined efforts pushed the French slowly to the east. By late summer and early autumn of 1796, the theater of war had moved back to the Rhineland, and Austria and France struggled for control of the river and its crossings. After the Battle of Schliengen on 24 October 1796, Moreau escaped with his army into France and offered an armistice to Charles, which Charles was inclined to accept. An armistice would free him to send a portion of his army into Italy, to relieve Wurmser at besieged Mantua. The Aulic Council in Vienna refused the armistice, so Charles ordered simultaneous sieges at Kehl and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, moving north with the bulk of his force to conduct the |Siege of Kehl, and leaving Karl Aloys zu F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg to besiege the old Vauban fort at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen.10
Terrain
 The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons. The  stretch between Rheinfall, by Schaffhausen and Basel, the High Rhine (Hochrhein) cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed; in such paces as the former rapids at Laufenburg, it moves in torrents.11 The terrain flattens a few miles north and east of Basel. The Rhine makes a wide, northerly turn, in what is called the Rhine knee, and enters the so-called Rhine ditch (Rheingraben), part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west. In 1796, the plain on both sides of the river, some  wide, was dotted with villages and farms. At both far edges of the flood plain, especially on the eastern side, the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon. Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest, creating deep defiles in the mountains. The tributaries meandered in rivulets through the flood plain to the river.12
The river itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the 21st century; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was &quot;corrected&quot; (straightened) between 1817 and 1875. Between 1927 and 1975, engineers constructed a canal to control the water level. In 1790, though, the river was wild and unpredictable, in some places more than four or more times wider than the twenty-first century, even under regular conditions. Its channels wound through marsh and meadow, and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods.13 It was crossable at Kehl, by Strasbourg, and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, by Basel, where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable.14
Fortress
 In the late Middle Ages, the village belonged to the house of Habsburg, a portion of family inheritance; by the late seventeenth century, although the village itself belong to the city of Basel. H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen was wrested from the Holy Roman Empire by Julius Henry of Saxe-Lauenburg in 1634; this transfer was secured by the Treaty of Westphalia, and the town subsequently passed by purchase to Louis XIV. Louis XIV ordered the construction of the fortress by the famous architect of fortifications, S&lt;U+00E9&gt;bastien Le Prestre de Vauban and a bridge was built across the Rhine to an ancillary fortification the island of Augst.1516 Vauban designed and constructed the fortress from 1679&lt;U+2013&gt;81.17 The trace italienne fortifications, such as the one at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, in early modern Europe changed the way warfare could be conducted. The conquest of a star fortress required different kind of warfare than an open-field battle where formation maneuver could defeat an enemy, or a battle in mixed terrain, such as that at Schliengen. The petite ponte on Augst covered a viaduct to the mainland.
The village of H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen lay within the boundaries of Canton Baselstadt and in 1801 had a population 945.18 Less than  from the village lay the fortress itself, spanning the river with a bridge. The fortress itself included a munitions house, an arsenal, a small hospital, and housing for a garrison of approximately 1,200 troops; after his withdrawal from the eastern side of the Rhine, Moreau left behind 3,000 to assist Abatucci in the fortress' defense.1920 The fortress's star shape left no dead zones typical of the old style (pre-Vauban) fortress: every corner of the fortress could be defended from within. This required the assailants to construct parallel ramparts surrounding the fortress. These ramparts held batteries of artillery that could lay an effective barrage on the fortress itself.21
Diplomacy and politics
The Vauban fortresses at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen and Kehl were both important bridgeheads across the river; maintaining control of them had been critical in Jourdan's relatively easy access to the German side of the Rhine. The principal fortresses lay on the west side (French side) of the Rhine; the bridgeheads and the smaller fortifications surrounding those lay on the west side. Taking them would require a costly and time consuming siege.22  Charles had formulated a plan to circumvent that problem, and to free enough of his troops to send a sizable relief fortress into northern Italy, where Wurmser held Mantua against the French. If the French would agree to an armistice, he could take command of the fortresses; the French would withdraw, and he could send a sizable force to northern Italy to help relieve Mantua. The Siege of Mantua was long and costly, and had tied up a significant portion of both the French and Austrian force. The French Directory was willing to give up the Mantua in exchange for the Rhine bridgeheads, which they deemed important for the defense of France; General Clark, their envoy sent to negotiate between the Austrians and the French in Italy, could not convince Napoleon Bonaparte to allow the Habsburgs to keep Mantua. He flatly refused the suggestion, maintaining that Mantua was the keystone to Habsburg Italy.23
Simultaneously, Moreau had offered an armistice to Charles in keeping with his own goals. Charles wanted to accept terms of armistice on the Rhine so he could send a large part of his army to attack the French in norther Italy. Instead, his brother and the civilian military advisers of the Council instructed him to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible access to southern Germany via the Rhine. By tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the two strongly-fortified and well-staffed Vauban fortresses across the river, the Aulic Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. With the failure of Paul Davidovich's relief column to reach their beleaguered comrades, Wurmser hoped still that Joseph Alvintzy would cross the Adige river to support him. In negotiations with Napoleon, General Clark, from the French Directory, proposed an armistice that would last until June 1797. Bonaparte refused any armistice until Mantua surrendered; the Directory had hopes of retaining H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen and Kehl, and would allow Austria to keep Mantua, which Napoleon flatly refused, believing Mantua the keystone to Habsburg Italy.24 When it became clear that Charles was locked into place at Kehl, and F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenburg at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades (approximately 12,000 troops) to Italy to support Napoleon's assault on Mantua, leaving behind modest defense at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen.25 Pierre Marie Barth&lt;U+00E9&gt;lemy Ferino, who had supervised the rear guard action as Moreau's army withdrew over the bridge, remained behind had been to guard earthworks around the bridgehead; the remainder of the French force filled the bridgehead itself, the islands surrounding it, and the fields on the west bank of the Rhine.26 
Conduct of siege
While the siege in Kehl continued, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg remained in &quot;observation&quot; at H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, meaning his troops created a surrounding perimeter and initiated construction of earthen works to allow them to assault the fortification later.27 Probably exceeding his instructions, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead, the French general of brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci, the opportunity to surrender, which was declined. Immediately, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg's chief engineer opened the fortifications and drained the water-filled moat. In subsequent days, the Austrians expanded ramparts and trenches along the Weyl and to Haltingen. In the night of 30 November &lt;U+2013&gt; 1 December, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg's troops stormed the bridgehead twice, but were twice repulsed.28 By 20 November, the Austrians had completed construction of the Ferdinand batteries. On the 21-24 of that month, they advanced further, covering the route between Freiburg im Breisgau and Basel, and constructed the batteries of Charles and Elizabeth, which, laying closer to the river, could fire directly into the defenders' redoubts. On the evening of the 24th, the Austrians fired 100 shells and 600 balls into the fortress. On 28 November, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg offered General Abbatucci another opportunity to surrender, giving him three hours to consider. He responded that any surrender was impossible. In mid-day, a cannonade began, that destroyed much of the bridges between the points.29 This continued for several days, from 28 November until early December. Abbatucci led a sortie in which the French attempted to take one of the batteries from the Austrians but was wounded in the chest. He died in the evening of 2&lt;U+2013&gt;3 December.30
The Austrians improved their earthworks between 9 and 14 January, and later augmented their batteries with nine pieces of large caliber, brought to the siege after the successful completion of the assault on Kehl, with another several thousand men.31 F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen, and day by day, the situation for the garrison within the fortress became more dire. The batteries called Charles and Elizabeth that girded the fortress downstream (see map in box) poured balls and shells into the fort, destroying the pontoons connecting the island fortifications to the mainland on both sides. Eventually the battery Ferdinand (located more or less due east) added to the shelling.32 The Austrians continued to expand their trenches and redoubts, creating an earthwork along the Swiss border. From these angles, the Austrians could deploy deadly artillery and musketry fire into the French positions.33  The trenches, opened originally in November, had refilled with winter rain and snow in the intervening weeks. F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg ordered them opened again, and the water drained out on 25 January. The Habsburgs secured the earthworks surrounding the trenches. On 31 January the French failed to push the Austrians out.34 Archduke Charles arrived that day and met with F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg at nearby L&lt;U+00F6&gt;rrach. The night of 31 January to 1 February was relatively tranquil, marred only by ordinary artillery fire and shelling.35 At mid-day 1 February 1797, as the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead, General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the French commander who had replaced Abbatucci, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack for both sides, offering to surrender the position. On 5 February, F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead, which was, by that time, a pile of rubble.36

Aftermath
 Moreau had offered an armistice to Charles after his withdrawal from Schliengen, which Charles was inclined to accept. Charles wanted to secure the Rhine crossings and then send troops to northern Italy to relieve Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser at besieged Mantua. The Holy Roman Emperor, and the civilian military advisers of the Aulic Council categorically refused such an armistice, ordering Charles to conduct simultaneous sieges at Kehl and H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen. This tied his army to the Rhine for most of the winter. While the Austrians besieged these Rhine crossings, Moreau had sufficient surplus troops to send 14Â demi-brigades into Italy to assist in the siege at Mantua.39 In terms of casualties, the French lost almost 30% of their force. Most casualties occurred in November and December, when the French lost more than a quarter of their force. In addition, 25-year-old Jean Charles Abbatucci, a rising star in the French military, was killed in early December. With the capitulation, the remaining troops marched out unharmed.40 Austrian casualties were light, and after three months of siege, they were able to take possession of a pile of rubble.41
There were personal victories. After the battle at Schliengen, it spoke highly of Charles' confidence in the young F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg that the Archduke would charge him with the taking of the H&lt;U+00FC&gt;ningen bridgehead.42 After the capitulation, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg as Colonel and Proprietor of the Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.rstenberg&quot;/&gt; For Charles, success at Huningen represented a victorious conclusion of the campaign for which he acquired the name Savior of Germany.43
General Moreau established a monument for Abbatucci in the center of the village, but it was destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars.44 The fortress was besieged again from 22 December 1813 until 14 April 1814 by Bavarian troops under the command of General Zoller before the French garrison surrendered.45 The monument was not rebuilt until after the July Monarchy.&quot;/&gt; The town market square is still named in his honor.46
