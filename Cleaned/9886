Music is the third album by American singer-songwriter Carole King. It is a continuation of the style laid down in Tapestry. The album was released in December 1971 and quickly rose to the top of the charts. It features songs such as &quot;It's Going to Take Some Time&quot; (US No. 12 by The Carpenters), &quot;Sweet Seasons,&quot; a No. 9 hit for Carole King, and &quot;Brother, Brother&quot;.
Carole King: Music experienced immediate success and was certified gold on December 9, 1971, days after release. It was certified platinum on July 17, 1995.
Music entered the top ten at No. 8, becoming the first of many weeks both Tapestry and Carole King: Music would occupy the top ten simultaneously. The album hit No. 1 on New Year's Day 1972 and stayed there for three consecutive weeks.
This time Carole King plays the piano and celeste on many tracks.
