Ben Hope is a mountain in northern Scotland. It is the most northerly Munro, standing alone in the flow country (bumpy, peat-covered moorland) south-east of Loch Hope in Sutherland. The mountain is a roughly triangular wedge, with a great crag on the west, with two lower shoulders to the south and northeast. Alpine flowers are abundant in season, although the ground is very rocky.
The principal route to the summit starts in Strathmore, to the west of the mountain, following the Alltnacaillich Burn which flows down through a gap in the west-facing crags. The route is steep, but well marked and not exposed. Approach from the east is rare, as there is a wide expanse of heather-covered moorland with no roads in that direction. Approach from the north is not possible for walkers, as there is no path between the crags.
On a clear day the view from the summit includes the Pentland Firth, Loch Eriboll and the nearby mountains of Arkle and Foinaven.
Just south of the Alltnacaillich burn on the Strathmore road is the Dun Dornaigil Broch.
