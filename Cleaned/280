Chad Collyer (born December 12, 1974) is an American professional wrestler. A Heartland Wrestling Association mainstay, Collyer is perhaps best known for his appearances with Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.
Career
Collyer attended Manchester College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. 1 He was an accomplished amateur wrestler, winning multiple championships over an eleven year period, but decided to turn professional rather than continue his amateur career during his freshman year. 2
Upon graduation, Collyer travelled to Tampa, Florida to train at the Malenko Pro Wrestling School under Dean Malenko and Jeff Bradley. Collyer began training on August 3, 1997. He debuted on December 6, 1997, at Kahuna's Bar and Grill in St. Petersburg, Florida, facing Jet Jaguar. 3 4 5
In 2000, Collyer toured England twice with Scott Conway's Wrestling Alliance. He returned to England in 2001 and September 2002, competing for Brian Dixon's All Star Promotions. 6
In 2002, Collyer returned to Japan, where he had worked previously in 1999, facing Tiger Mask. He wrestled for Michinoku Pro Wrestling between June 2002 and March 2003 as Metal Master, a masked gladiator. 7 He feuded with The Great Sasuke over the NWA World Middleweight Championship, but was unable to defeat the veteran. Collyer also appeared for MPW as The Stealth, and for New Japan Pro Wrestling as Chad Malenko. 8
Heartland Wrestling Association (1997-)
Collyer debuted in the Midwestern Heartland Wrestling Association immediately after debuting. In 1998, Collyer teamed with Shark Boy on a number of occasions. 9 In 1999, Collyer and Shark Boy began feuding with &quot;Bad Boy&quot; Bobby Kane and Tarek the Great. On March 6, 1999 and April 3, 1999, Collyer unsuccessfully challenged Kane for the HWA Cruiserweight Championship. 10
Collyer received a third title shot on March 25, 2000, losing to Shark Boy by disqualification after Matt Stryker interfered on his behalf. Stryker and Collyer subsequently aligned themselves with valet Hellena Heavenly, forming a tag team known as Hellena's Hunks. Over the following weeks, Stryker and Heavenly vied with Shark Boy while Collyer toured Japan. Collyer returned to the HWA in July 2000, wrestling Shark Boy on a number of occasions, yet failing to win the HWA Cruiserweight Championship. On September 30, 2000, Shark Boy defeated Collyer in a last man standing match. 11
On October 27, 2000, Collyer unsuccessfully challenged Race Steele for the HWA Heavyweight Championship. 12 He defeated Steele on January 26, 2001, thus winning his first title, the HWA Heavyweight Championship. He held the title for just over month before being stripped of it on February 27, 2001 upon embarking upon a six week tour to England. 13 14
Collyer returned to the HWA in July 2001. On August 9, 2001, he wrestled at the third annual Brian Pillman Memorial Show, taking part in a four way bout for the HWA Cruiserweight Championship.

In January 2002, Collyer lost a best of three series for the number one contendership to the HWA Cruiserweight Championship to Stryker. In late January, Collyer began feuding with the Cruiserweight Champion, Shannon Moore. He conceded several matches before defeating Moore and Stryker in a three way bout to win the HWA Cruiserweight Championship on February 13, 2002. Moore and Collyer subsequently engaged in a best of seven series, with Moore winning the deciding bout and the Cruiserweight Championship on March 24, 2002. On April 7, 2002, Hellena Heavenly claimed that she was pregnant, with numerous wrestlers claiming that they were the father. Over the following weeks, Collyer faced each of the claimants. 16
Collyer was subsequently largely inactive in the HWA until 2003. On May 2, 2003, Collyer won a Royal Rumble match with the HWA Heavyweight Championship on the line. He lost the title to Nigel McGuinness on September 6, 2003. 17 Following his loss, Collyer appeared intermittedly with the HWA until January 11, 2005, when he defeated Brian Beech for the HWA Television Championship. He lost the title to &quot;High IQ&quot; Quinten Lee on January 18, 2005. Collyer subsequently appeared sporadically with the HWA throughout 2005, wrestling Stryker and James Gibson in technical bouts, and briefly feuding with Cody Hawk in August 2005. 18 19

Collyer returned to TNA on June 16, 2004 as one-third of The Elite Guard, a stable consisting of Collyer, Hotstuff Hernandez and Onyx. The Elite Guard were portrayed as being lackeys of Jeff Jarrett brought into TNA in order to defeat the 3Live Kru. The 3Live Kru and The Elite Guard feuded over the following weeks, culminating in a ten-man &quot;guitar on a pole&quot; match on July 14, 2004 that saw Dusty Rhodes, Larry Zbyszko and the 3Live Kru defeat Jarrett, Ken Shamrock and The Elite Guard when Rhodes pinned Onyx. Following the loss, The Elite Guard was removed from TNA television. In Collyer's final TNA match on July 30, 2004, he and Hernandez were defeated by America's Most Wanted in a dark match. 28
Ring of Honor (2003-2006)
Collyer debuted in Ring of Honor on January 11, 2003 at Revenge on The Prophecy, defeating Matt Stryker.

On June 12, 2004 at World Title Classic, Collyer faced Hydro, Superstar Steve and Ray Gordy in a &quot;Four Corner Survival&quot; match, with the stipulation that the winner would take part in the ROH Pure Wrestling Championship tournament in July 2004. The bout was won by Hydro. 29
In late 2004, Ricky Steamboat, an advocate of technical wrestling, began feuding with Mick Foley, a proponent of hardcore wrestling, with Collyer taking the side of Steamboat along with other mat-based wrestlers such as Nigel McGuinness. On October 16, 2004 at Joe vs Punk II, Collyer and McGuinness (accompanied by Steamboat) defeated B.J. Whitmer and Dan Maff (accompanied by Foley).
