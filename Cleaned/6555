The Sims 2 is a strategic life simulation computer game developed by Maxis and Shwetal and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game, The Sims, which debuted on February 4, 2000.1
The Sims 2 has the same concept as its predecessor. Players control their Sims in various activities and forming relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, The Sims, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims 2 has life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live over 100 Sim days depending on the degree of which their aspirations are fulfilled (although some items can extend a Sim's lifespan further).
The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a more powerful 3D graphics engine. It was first released on September 14, 2004 and became an instant success, selling a then-record one million copies in its first ten days.2 In addition to its commercial success, The Sims 2 was well received by critics.3 As of July 26, 2007, The Sims 2 has sold more than 13 million units worldwide and was the best-selling PC game of 2004.4 A sequel, The Sims 3, was announced by EA in November 2006 and is scheduled for release in June 2009.56 As of April 2008, The Sims 2 website celebrated 100 million copies of The Sims series sold.7
Gameplay
Life stages
Sims can progress through six life stages of development: baby, toddler, child, teen, young adult (with the first expansion pack, University), adult, elder. Sims die naturally after a certain number of days in the elder life stage, determined by how high their Aspiration Score was when they first became Elders. They can only die by unnatural causes after the toddler stage, although children are typically taken away by social workers before their needs decrease to a low level. The different life stages present different challenges, such as the reduced mobility of elders, children not being able to cook, the managing of the unpredictable toddlers, and the constant care of infants.
Characters
There are three pre-made neighborhoods in The Sims 2, Pleasantview, Strangetown and Veronaville. Others come with various expansion packs. Many pre-made characters have their own storylines and history. The main neighborhood that has run through The Sims and The Sims 2 is Pleasantview (called both Sim Lane and Old Town in the original), the beginning of The Sims 2 being set 25 years after the first game. Sunset Valley, the main neighborhood going to be featured in The Sims 3 is reportedly the same place around the same time before The Sims storyline and the sims 2 storyline .
Needs
Sims are driven by their Needs. Sims have up to eight needs (or &quot;motives&quot;) depending on their age, ranging from tangible needs such as &quot;Bladder&quot; (the need to urinate) and &quot;Energy&quot; (the need to sleep), to more ephemeral such as &quot;Social&quot; contact and a pleasant &quot;Environment&quot;. These needs are displayed graphically with meters that change from green (full) to red (desperation), and a Sim with an empty meter will require or insist on an action which fulfills it (for instance, if the Hunger meter is low, a Sim will open the refrigerator and &quot;stuff [his/her] face&quot;, or the user may direct them to cook an item). Some empty meters also cause actions. A Sim with an empty energy meter will pass out; a teen, adult, or elder Sim with an empty Hunger meter will die. These Needs are compiled into an overall &quot;mood&quot; meter, which is displayed by a diamond (called a plumbob) that hovers above the active Sim's head. The needs of babies (which are social, hunger, bladder, fun, hygiene &amp; energy) are not shown as with other Sims, but their portrait on the left hand side of the screen indicates Sims as red (desperation), yellow (low), green (okay) or white (full).
Social Worker
Should your Sim fail to care for a baby by leaving its needs too low for too long, a Social Worker will come and collect all children on the family lot. Your children may be taken away if you leave them home alone. The Social Worker will also get involved if children do not attend school, or if they get too hot or cold (possible with the Seasons Expansion Pack) or if both the parents die. The expansion pack FreeTime allows a Sim to 'Plead with the Social Worker' so their children are not taken away. If your children are taken away then the household Sims will be banned from adopting permanently.
The Social Worker can also come to the Sims' lot when she brings an adopted child.
Personality
Personality is a quantified way of measuring a Sim's behavioral characteristics. There are five personality traits (Sloppy/Neat, Shy/Outgoing, Lazy/Active, Serious/Playful and Grouchy/Nice), which players can control by allocating 'points'; for example, a Sim can be active, lazy or somewhere in between the two extremes. These traits determine how fast a Sim learns skills, the rate at which specific needs decay, the types of interactions a Sim will autonomously engage in, the likelihood of interactions and the likelihood of bringing home a friend from school or work. All Sims communicate in a language known as &quot;Simlish&quot;. Simlish is a &quot;language&quot; made up of gibberish words, with meaning implied only through tone of voice and other paralinguistic cues. 8
Career
Children and teenagers may attend school from Monday to Friday. Homework completion and mood affect their grades (high grades generate cash or skills). Parents may enroll their children in private schools, after success in a minigame of inviting the headmaster for dinner. Truancy from school lowers grades. If a child's grades are too low, a social worker shows up to take the child. However, if teens' grades drop to low levels, they will not be taken away but may be sacked from their after-school job per request of their school counselor. An adult Sim can find a job from either a computer or a newspaper. Teenagers can also find after-school jobs in the same way. Sims who go to work in a good mood and have the required friends and skill points will get promotions. Each career contains ten jobs with increasing salary, each with its own uniform, hours and days of the week worked, and carpool. There is also the 'call in sick' option, where the sim can take a day off work. However, if your sim is faking, they may face serious consequences such as losing their job or getting demoted.
There are various career options including Culinary, Athletics, Business, Politics, Military, Law Enforcement, Medicine and Science. The Sims 2: University, Sims 2: Seasons and Sims 2: Free Time expansion packs add additional career options to the pool. Successfully progressing through a career unlocks an object exclusive to that career, known as a career reward, most of them are useful for improvement of a skill that is critical to the career. When reaching old age, a Sim may retire, and receive a daily pay (pension). Pensions vary depending on the career and level of job carried out. Teenagers and elders may also seek employment, however only three jobs are offered in each career track for the teen/elder age groups and they receive about one-third to one-half less than an adult would be paid. Also, in Sims 2: Open For Business, the Sims have the option of starting a home business or creating one on a purchased community lot. Sims can also paint on an easel to earn skill points and you can sell the finished product or hang it on your wall. Sims with high creativity scores can also sell the novels they write for cash.
Aspiration
New to The Sims 2 is the &quot;Aspiration&quot; meter, roughly analogous to self-esteem or life satisfaction. As toddlers and children, Sims aspire only to &quot;Grow Up&quot;, but upon becoming teens, the player must assign Sims one of five life aspirations: Family (befriending family members, marrying and raising a large family), Fortune (wealth and prestige), Knowledge (skill enhancement and life experience), Popularity (making friends and socializing) and Romance (having many romantic relationships with as many people as possible). With the Nightlife expansion, a new aspiration was added: Pleasure (wanting to live an enjoyable life). A hidden aspiration called Grilled Cheese (wanting to perform as many grilled cheese-related actions as possible, including talking about grilled cheese and making grilled cheese for other Sims) is available for use through the failed use of the ReNuYu Senso Orb (using it with Green or Red Aspiration Level) or as a secondary aspiration with FreeTime.
Each has wants and fears that correspond to his or her aspiration, stage of life and present circumstances. When a want is achieved, such as to &quot;make a friend&quot;, aspiration points are allotted to the aspiration meter; conversely, when a fear is realized, such as the death of a spouse, aspiration points are decreased. There are six levels to the meter: the highest is platinum, then gold, two levels of green and two of red, with the meter depleting a small amount every few hours. The higher levels take around 8&lt;U+2013&gt;16 hours to decay to Green, while Green takes about 32 hours to become Red.
Sims with a platinum meter are fulfilled, docile and more willing to perform tasks they dislike; Sims with red meters will experience nervous breakdowns and either talk to an inanimate object or require treatment from an automatically summoned psychiatrist who is invisible to other Sims. Aspiration levels determine how a Sim will live as an Elder before death. If the Sim grew up well with a high aspiration meter throughout each change in phase the gravestone or jar of ashes will be more significant.
The Sim's lifetime total of Aspiration points are recorded by the game, and can be used to buy special items that have unique effects, such as providing free money or altering lifespan, but only if the aspiration meter is at &quot;gold&quot; or &quot;platinum&quot; level; if not, the chance of success decreases and negative side effects may occur.9
In the FreeTime expansion, a new lifetime aspiration meter was added. As Sims achieve very important lifetime event such as marriage or a birth of a child, they will gain a little lift in the meter and for every section you complete you get rewards, e.g. choosing a secondary aspiration. Getting to the top of the meter will make the Sim achieve permanent platinum aspiration, which can also be achieved by completing a Sim's &quot;Lifetime Aspiration&quot; Which normally involves a long term want, such as reaching the top of a certain career, or having a certain number of children.
Relationships
Romantic relationships can happen in a number of ways. Constantly flirting with another Sim will result in a crush on one another and eventually fall in love. Sims can simply remain in a de facto relationship or they can get married. With the addition of The Sims 2: Nightlife, Sims can also date each other, as well as taking part in many romantic themed interactions. Sims also have chemistry with one another, which is affected by what they find attractive in another Sim, related to personality, aspiration, or appearance. There is also a jealousy factor if an involved Sim flirts with another Sim who is not their partner. The partner will become angry with them and with the Sim who participated the flirting. It is possible that Sims will start fights, insult and annoy individuals 'caught' flirting or more with another Sim; they can even &quot;break up&quot; if their relationship level plummets to a certain level. Sims can also have children if they are really &quot;into&quot; each other or are married.
(The following requires the Nightlife expansion pack.) Sims can also go out on dates with Sims they know, or they can use their phone to call out for a blind date. The compatibility of Sims and their &quot;mystery date&quot; is determined by how much the player pays the matchmaker. A certain amount of time is given to accomplish things during the date. Three actual minutes, or three sim hours. There are several different levels that a sim can achieve during their date. Each level is reached by a Sim's actions towards their partner during the date. Every time the Sim gets a higher level, more time is added to their meter. If their level decreases, no extra points are deducted. The lowest ranking is &quot;disaster.&quot; The highest ranking is &quot;dream date.&quot; If the sim reaches &quot;dream date,&quot; then their companion may send them a gift and a note. &quot;Woohoo&quot; can be done during a date as well as other Sims being conceived. The player can see the partner's wants, which helps them fill the success bar. Popular activities for dates outside their home is to go to a community lot to bowl, dine, dance, or shop. If the Sims do not talk to each other much, it can damage their relationship. Also, if a Sim decides to date another Sim, while dating someone else, it can lead to the two already dating Sims being furious with each other for a period of time.
Death
Sims can die in many ways. If a Sim reaches the end of the Elder life stage, he or she will die of old age and the Grim Reaper will come and take the Sim away. Sims can also prematurely die of other ways, such as being struck by lightning, hit by hail, drowning, fire, and other things. If a Sim dies of old age, an insurance company will pay out money to their living relatives and family members. The amount given to each Sim is proportional to how good their relationship was with the deceased Sim.
If all the Sims in a lot are 'dead', this is The Sims 2 equivalent to a Game Over. Time pauses, the &quot;Live Mode&quot; option turns off, and a dialog box labeled &quot;The Finale&quot; pops up that says that &quot;...unfortunately, the way things stand now, The Sims 2 is a LIFE simulator.&quot; It then gives you suggestions of what you could do with the lot. If all the adult/teen/elders on the lot die the social worker will come and take the children away, a similar box will appear saying &quot;The orphanage awaits&quot;.
In the Sims 2 University expansion pack a career achievement prize for the paranormal career track allows players to revive dead sims with a special phone to contact the Grim Reaper with. There is a chance that the revival of a dead Sims will result in the sim being summoned as a zombie. Also in the Sims 2 Apartment Life expansion pack the player can bring sims back from the dead if they are a witch. If the player is an evil witch they can bring the sim back as a zombie but if they are a good witch they can bring the sim back as normal.
Other characters
There are several types of Sims:
Townies (Visitor): They are Non-Player Characters (NPCs). They may become playable if they join a household or if they are teens who go to the university.
These Sims are those which are roughly equivalent to playable Sims; since the addition of Nightlife they can have jobs and other characteristics of a playable Sim, except they do not live on an actual lot. They visit the Community and Residential lots and can be interacted with just like any other Sim. With Pets, it includes dogs and cats. There are some unique characters or group of townies like Big Diva, Slob, Grand Vampire, Cheerleader &amp; Mascot.
Worker townies: They are NPCs. They may become playable if they join a household or if they are teens who go to the university.
These Sims can be hired to perform services for a fee (such as cleaning, gardening, repairing etc), can do delivery (newspaper, mail, groceries, pizza and Chinese Food with University) or can be a city employee (police, firefighter, social worker, repo man, headmaster, adoption service).
Default characters: They are the default NPCs. Most of them can't become playable without the use of cheat codes.
In the base game, these characters are the Grim Reaper, the therapist, the social bunny, Bella and the Pollination Technician #7. Several expansion packs introduce new characters like Holiday Party Pack adds Santa Claus, Father Time and Baby New Year. There are other funny ones such as Mrs.Crumplebottom who is brought in to the game by Nightlife. She is best known for smacking sims with her handbag. The Bon Voyage Expansion also includes the Unsavory Charlatan, a nasty pickpocket that, if caught can be reported to police and fought with.
Creatures: They are playable and are Sims who are transformed or standalone creatures.
They are Sims based on a mythical creature and they have special abilities and behavior except in the base game where Ghost isn't playable and extraterrestrials are actually just regular sims with some strange genetic traits (green skin, black eyes). Several expansion packs introduce new classes of creature: Zombies, Vampires, Servos (robots), Werewolves, PlantSims, Bigfoot and Witches.
Neighborhoods
At startup, the player chooses to view one of several neighborhoods. The original game ships with three neighborhoods, and the option to create additional ones. Neighborhoods, including the sub-neighborhoods for each, are separate from each other, and Sims cannot move between them, or contact Sims in other neighborhoods, in-game.
Some of the expansion packs add sub-neighborhoods, where the Sims can travel under different circumstances. The Sims 2: University adds campus sub-neighborhoods, exclusively for student player Sims, where they can live in regular houses, dorms or Greek houses are also available. The Sims 2: Bon Voyage adds vacation sub-neighborhoods, where Sims can live in hotels or vacation homes. You may make a new customized neighborhood or play within the three that come with the game.
Each neighborhood has space for several residential and/or community lots. New with The Sims 2: Apartment Life are apartments, condos and duplexes complete with potentially noisy neighbours and landlords.
With SimCity 4, you can create your own template for a new neighborhood.
Premade neighborhoods
In The Sims 2, three neighborhoods created by Maxis (Pleasantview, Strangetown and Veronaville) were included. Riverblossom Hills comes with the Seasons expansion, Desiderata Valley comes with FreeTime, Belladonna Cove comes with Apartment Life, and Bluewater Village is included with the Open for Business expansion but is a subneighborhood, much like the Downtown area included in Nightlife. Some expansion packs add a new complementary or self-contained neighborhood. Each neighborhood contains lots. Sims live and build their homes on residential lots and visit community lots, which house recreational hangouts, such as pools and malls.
Pleasantview is a neighborhood with many of the characters from The Sims. Strangetown has Alien Sims as well as normal human Sims. Veronaville has many references to the works of Shakespeare, particularly A Midsummer Night's Dream (with a family's surname being Summerdream) and Romeo and Juliet &lt;U+2014&gt; with Verona being the town in which the play is set, and the title characters having their surnames. For example, there are two feuding families named the Capps (Capulets) and the Montys (Montagues). The neighborhood also includes characters from The Tempest, King Lear, and Much Ado About Nothing.
Neighborhoods added with the Expansion Packs are modeled after the new additions. Riverblossom Hills features gardening and weather references with farm-like land and most of its premade houses look much like farm houses. Desiderata Valley features the new community lots - such as the &quot;secret&quot; community lots that come from hobbies. Belladonna Cove, the newest neighborhood added to the bunch, features apartment complexes as well as the secret &quot;magical world&quot;. Bluewater Village, the sub-neighborhood, is featured in every neighborhood, much like Downtown. Bluewater Village features small businesses started by the sims who live in the neighborhood.
Both University and Bon Voyage added three sub-neighborhoods that were inspired from the added main content of the expansion pack. University added the three college locations Sim State University, La Fiesta Tech and Acad&lt;U+00E9&gt;mie Le Tour - all of which are specifically modeled for Pleasantview, Strangetown and Veronaville, respectively. While Bon Voyage's locations were not modeled for one of the three main neighborhoods, each location offers unique landscapes and local residents. The three vacation areas are Twikkii Island, Three Lakes, and Takemizu Village.
Lots, build &amp; buy mode
From the neighborhood view, the player selects to play one lot, as in The Sims 1. There are residential and community lots. Sims live in residential lots, and can travel to community lots to purchase groceries, clothing and magazines as well as interact with Townies.
The player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into a built-up lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from The Sims 1 is foundations.
The player switches between the live mode (default) to control Sims, the buy mode to add, move or delete furniture, or the build mode to rebuild the house. Buy &amp; build mode for community lots is locked when player Sims visit the lot, but available from neighborhood view.
Minigames
The game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points, or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school. Some expansion packs have new minigames (like running a Greek house in University, or dating in Nightlife). In Nightlife, each date in and of itself is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible, while accumulating aspiration points
Plot
Although gameplay is open-ended, The Sims 2 has characters with histories, and the game is designed to incorporate expanded photo album features or a packaged blog, such as a neighborhood photo album. The three pre-loaded neighborhoods each have a storyline told through the existing photo albums and the Sims' personal biographies.
The first pre-made neighborhood is called Pleasantview, which contains families in the original The Sims game. It features some Sims from the original game but much older. Many of the families' stories focuses on sims cheating on their lovers. The Goth family are mourning Bella Goth after she has disappeared, and her now grown daughter, Cassandra, has a mismatched love life. Don Lothario is described as a romancer. He is engaged to Cassandra Goth but has 3 other lovers. Brandi Broke, the child of Bob and Betty Newbie, is an adult, living in a trailer &amp; raising her children after her husband Skip's death. The Pleasant family, now featuring a grown Daniel, are in conflict. Daniel is having an affair with the maid and twins Angela and Lilith do not get along. Darren Dreamer, an artist, is in love with Cassandra Goth. Dina Caliente and her sister Nina are in love with Mortimer Goth and Don Lothario, respectively. Dina is a golddigger who wants Mortimer's money and Nina wants pleasure out of her relationships.
The next pre-made neighborhood is called Strangetown, including the Curious family who are made up of three brothers, one of whom is pregnant to an alien. The neighborhood is also home to an extraterrestrial Sim known as Pollination Technician #9 Smith who has four children - two of which are grown up and one who is about to become an adult, and have inherited his green skin and two also have his black eyes. Much of the neighborhood's sub-plot focuses on the feud General Buzz Grunt and his son have with the Smith family which it is suggested is based on the family's extraterrestrial heritage. The missing Bella Goth from Pleasantview can also be found here as an NPC or &quot;townie&quot;.
The third pre-made neighborhood is named Veronaville. Many of the Sims are named after Shakespeare's characters from Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer's Night Dream. The plot of the neighborhood mainly focuses on two teenagers, Romeo and Juliet, who have fallen in love despite their families feuding with one another.
History
Development
EA Games announced on May 5, 2003 that the Maxis studio had begun development on The Sims 2.10 The game was first shown at E3 in Los Angeles, California on May 13, 2004.11 Will Wright admits that while most of the content of The Sims 2 are original ideas, inspiration for its own expansions and constituents spawned from the successes of the first game. The community interest in the antecedent The Sims: Unleashed and The Sims: Hot Date expansions ensured the creation of The Sims 2: Pets and The Sims 2: Nightlife expansions, respectively.12
After development concluded, designers from Maxis regarded The Sims 2 as very capricious during creation. Bugs would appear, and Sims would be &quot;tweaked&quot;, or have anomalies not present in a previous run.13 A teaser trailer was provided on the Makin' Magic CD but was later uploaded to websites all over the Internet.
Controversy
The Sims 2 malleable content and open-ended customization have led to controversy on the subject of pay sites and sexual modifications. Custom content is distributed through independent websites, some of which charge for downloading materials. This is illegal per the game's EULA14, which prohibits the commercial use of tools such as Bodyshop. The package file (which is installed in the downloads folder so that the player can use custom content in-game) is legally EA's property, making the sale of package files illegal. Some modifications, purportedly revealing sexual anatomy of the Sims, sparked legal controversy.
On July 22, 2005, former Florida attorney Jack Thompson alleged that Electronic Arts and The Sims 2 promoted nudity through the use of a mod or a cheat code. The claim was made that pubic hair, labia and other genital details were visible once the &quot;blur&quot; (the pixelation that occurs when a Sim is using the toilet or is naked in the game) was removed.15 Electronic Arts issued a statement saying that when the censor was removed, Sims lack such anatomical definition, similar to Barbie and Ken dolls. Electronic Arts executive Jeff Brown said in an interview with GameSpot:16 
Prior to Thompson's statement, there was a cheat code which removed pixelation accessible from the console menu. Shortly after the statement, subsequent patches and expansion packs removed the &quot;intProp censorGridSize&quot; code.
Reception
The Sims 2 had a successful E3.1718 The game also received the Editor's Choice Award from IGN and GameSpy upon final review of the finished product.1920 From 71 online reviews, the average score was 90 out of 100. Seven of those sources awarded the game a 100 out of 100 score.21 X-Play gave the game a 4/5
The Sims creator, Will Wright was recognized by being nominated at the Billboard Digital Entertainment Awards for Visionary and Game Developer.22 The game was also nominated for two international awards in 2005.2324

Comparison to The Sims
Graphics
Graphically, The Sims 2 is more detailed than The Sims and allows players to view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as SimCity 2000, which used dimetric projection and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in The Sims. In The Sims, Sims are 3D meshes, but The Sims 2 introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim's facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim's nose to be very large or very small in The Sims 2's Create-a-Sim. Texturing is achieved through use of raster images, though it appears more lifelike.
Gameplay
The Sims 2 characters' pass through six life stages (seven with University), with eventual death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game.
Some of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the cleaning skill, a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations.
Game customization
 The Sims 2 is an extremely malleable game. Modders alter the game in ways as simple as creating a new floor texture of rocks or as complicated as writing entire patches for the game code to customize its behavior. Such modifications are all loosely referred to as &quot;custom content.&quot; Specifically, custom content can be divided into four categories: exporting (creating Sims and lots in-game or using the game's included Body Shop and exporting them to a file), recoloring (creating a new texture for an object), meshing (creating an object or modifying its shape) and hacking (writing code that manipulates game and object behaviors). At the beginning of the game you can 'Create-a-family' which you can create a wife/mother a husband/father and kids to complete the family. In The Sims 2 Pets you can create and save your own creative type of breed. They can look anyway you want them to look.
The modding community for The Sims 2 is self-supporting, with more advanced modders writing tools and tutorials to help in creating custom content and modifying the game environment. The &quot;Sims 2 Body Shop&quot; is a program shipped with The Sims 2 that allows users to create custom clothing and body recolors, such as eyes, hair and skin tone. These custom created parts can be imported directly into the game, or can be uploaded onto the official The Sims 2 Exchange for other users to download and implement into their own games. Two elements that propagate customization are the official Sims 2 Exchange and the extensive network of fan sites that distribute custom content. More than 250,000 Sims and lots have been uploaded to the Sims 2 Exchange on the Official Site.

Stuff packs
Stuff packs are add-ons that intend to add only new items (usually in the amount of 60) to the base game. However, some releases include certain gameplay elements introduced in previous expansion packs. There are nine stuff packs so far. The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack served as the pilot release for this line of products, which were called &quot;booster packs&quot;. After the success of the pilot release, EA named the releases &quot;stuff packs&quot; and launched the line with The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff. The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff pack should be The Sims 2's final stuff pack in the series.
