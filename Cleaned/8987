Masten Space Systems is an aerospace startup company in Mojave, California (formerly Santa Clara, California) that is developing a line of Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) spacecraft initially for unmanned research flights and eventually intended to support manned spaceflight.
Overview
Masten Space Systems is a Mojave, California based rocket company that is currently developing a line of reusable VTOL spacecraft, and related rocket propulsion hardware.
Masten Space Systems competed in the NASA and Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge X Prize in 2009, qualifying for the level one second prize of $150,000 1 and the level two first prize of $1,000,000.2 On November 2, 2009 it was announced that Masten Space Systems had won first place in the level two category, with Armadillo Aerospace coming in second.34
The XA Line of VTVL Suborbital Vehicles
The XA (eXtreme Altitude) line of suborbital Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles is a family of incrementally developed vehicles.
XA-0.1B
After the tethered flight mishap that led to XA-0.1 being retired, MSS recognized that a few of the important goals of XA-0.1 had not been achieved, most particularly demonstration of stable, controlled flight.
The primary goal of these two airframes was to demonstrate stable, controlled flight using a GN&amp;C system developed in-house at MSS. XA-0.1B originally featured four engines with  thrust, but was converted in Spring 2009 to be powered by one engine of  thrust.5
XA-0.1B - nicknamed &quot;Xombie&quot; - first flew free of tether September 19, 2009 6 and qualified for the Lunar Lander Challenge Level One second prize of $150,000 on October 7, 2009.7
XA-0.1E
XA-0.1E has an aluminum frame and features a version of Masten's  thrust engine that produces around  of thrust. &quot;Xoie&quot; - as the craft is nicknamed - qualified for the Lunar Lander Challenge level two on October 30, 2009.8
Commercial Flight
Masten Space System's Michael Mealling announced that Masten Space Systems plans to offer &quot;low altitude&quot; commercial flights in 2010.9 Masten Space Systems is currently offering payload space for sale on their website.
Other products and services
In addition to its eXtreme Altitude line of vehicles, Masten Space Systems is currently offering its internally developed igniters and engines commercially to interested and qualified parties.10
