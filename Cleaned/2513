Whoa, Nelly! is the debut album by Canadian singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado. It was released in North America on October 24, 2000 by DreamWorks Records. It peaked at number twenty-four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and opened to critical acclaim. It produced three international singles: &quot;I'm Like a Bird&quot;, &quot;Turn Off the Light&quot; and &quot;...On the Radio (Remember the Days)&quot;. &quot;Party's Just Begun (Again)&quot; was a club-only single released exclusively in the U.S. before the album's availability in stores,1 and it was included on the soundtrack of the 1999 film Brokedown Palace. When &quot;Party's Just Begun (Again)&quot; was released, Nelly's label was unsure about the genre in which to market her. They eventually remixed &quot;Party's Just Begun (Again)&quot; and included it on this album as &quot;Party&quot;. The DreamWorks label released &quot;Trynna Finda Way&quot; as the fourth single in Mexico and South America, and &quot;Hey, Man!&quot; as the fourth single in the UK and Germany. The album spent seventy-eight weeks on the Billboard 200. It hit double-platinum status in the U.S. in January 2002.2 After the release of the album, Furtado headlined the Burn in the Spotlight tour and appeared on Moby's Area:One tour. According to Maclean's magazine, Whoa, Nelly! had sold six million copies worldwide as of August 2006.3
Critical reception
Whoa, Nelly! was well received by critics for its eccentric, yet intriguing instrumentations as well as Furtado's vocals. It currently holds a score of 79 from Metacritic.4 Slant magazine called it &quot;a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium.&quot;5 The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and &quot;the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful.&quot;6 Stephan Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave a positive review while commenting that &quot;Furtado is a restless vocalist, skitting and scatting with abandon, spitting out rapid repetitions, bending notes, and frequently indulging in melismas.&quot;7 and also stating that &quot;Whoa, Nelly! unfolds as a rewarding, promising debut.&quot;8 Rolling Stone gave Whoa, Nelly! a positive review calling it a &quot;wild-ass pop go-go, filled with songs that pursue adventure yet could still make the hit parades.&quot;9 As a result of critical acclaim, this album received 4 nominations at the 2002 Grammy ceremony. The album itself received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, while Furtado herself was nominated for Best New Artist, as well as, Song of the Year and Best Pop Female Vocal Performance for &quot;I'm like a Bird&quot;, in which she received the latter.10 The album sold 8 million copies worldwide by 2011.
