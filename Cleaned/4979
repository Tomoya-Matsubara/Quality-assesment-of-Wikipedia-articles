Eugen D. Relgis (backward reading of Eisig D. Sigler; first name also Eugenio, Eug&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne or Eugene, last name also Siegler or Siegler Watchel;1 March 22, 1895 &lt;U+2013&gt; May 24, 1987) was a Romanian writer, pacifist philosopher and anarchist militant, known as the theorist of humanitarianism. His internationalist dogma, with distinct echoes from Judaism and Jewish ethics, was first shaped during World War I, when Relgis was a conscientious objector. Infused with anarcho-pacifism and socialism, it provided Relgis with an international profile, and earned him the support of pacifists such as Romain Rolland, Stefan Zweig and Albert Einstein. Another, more controversial, aspect of Relgis' philosophy was his support for eugenics, which centered on the compulsory sterilization of &quot;degenerates&quot;. The latter proposal was voiced by several of Relgis' essays and sociological tracts.
After an early debut with Romania's Symbolist movement, Relgis promoted modernist literature and the poetry of Tudor Arghezi, signing his name to a succession of literary and political magazines. His work in fiction and poetry alternates the extremes of Expressionism and didactic art, giving artistic representation to his activism, his pacifist vision, or his struggle with a hearing impairment. He was a member of several modernist circles, formed around Romanian magazines such as Sbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul, Contimporanul or &lt;U+015E&gt;antier, but also close to the more mainstream journal Via&lt;U+0163&gt;a Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt;. His political and literary choices made Relgis an enemy of both fascism and communism: persecuted during World War II, he eventually took refuge in Uruguay. From 1947 to the moment of his death, Relgis earned the respect of South American circles as an anarchist commentator and proponent of solutions to world peace, as well as a promoter of Latin American culture.
Biology
Early life and literary debut
The future Eugen Relgis was a native of Moldavia region, belonging to the local Jewish community. His father, David Sigler, professed Judaism,2 and descended from tanners settled in Neam&lt;U+0163&gt; County.3 Eisig had two sisters, Adelina Derevici and Eugenia Soru, both of whom had careers in biochemistry.4 Born in either Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i city567891011 of Piatra Neam&lt;U+0163&gt; town,12 Eisig was educated in Piatra Neam&lt;U+0163&gt;, where he became friends with the family of novelist and Zionist leader A. L. Zissu. It was in Zissu's circle that Relgis probably first met his mentor, the Romanian modernist author Tudor Arghezi; at the time, Arghezi was married to Constan&lt;U+0163&gt;a Zissu, mother of his photographer son Eli Lotar.13 The young writer later noted that he and Zissu were both touched by the wild landscape of the Ceahl&lt;U+0103&gt;u Massif and Piatra's shtetl atmosphere.14 In another one of his texts, Relgis recalled having been influenced in childhood by selective readings from the Romanian Jewish scholar Moses Schwarzfeld and his Anuarul pentru Israeli&lt;U+0163&gt;i journal (he told that, during later years, he had collected the entire Anuarul collection).15
Taking his first steps in literary life, Eisig Sigler adopted his new name through forms of wordplay which enjoyed some popularity among pseudonymous Jewish writers (the case of Paul Celan, born Ancel).16 He was from early on a promoter of Symbolist and modernist literature, a cause into which he blended his left-wing perspective and calls for Jewish emancipation. Writing in 2007, literary historian Paul Cernat suggested that Relgis, like fellow humanitarianist and Jewish intellectual Isac Ludo, had a &quot;not at all negligible&quot; part to play in the early diffusion of Romanian modernism.17 Relgis' main contribution in the 1910s was the Symbolist tribune Fronda (&quot;The Fronde&quot;), the three consecutive issues of which he edited, in Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i, between April and June 1912.18
Like Ludo's review Absolutio (which saw print two years later), Fronda stood for the radical branch of the Romanian Symbolist movement in Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i, in contrast to both the left-leaning but traditionalist magazine Via&lt;U+0163&gt;a Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt; and the more conventional Symbolism of Versuri &lt;U+015F&gt;i Proz&lt;U+0103&gt; journal.19 Its editorial board, Relgis included, went anonymous, but their names were known to other periodicals of the day and to later researchers. According to Cernat, Relgis was &quot;the most significant Frondiste&quot;, seconded by two future figures in Romanian Jewish journalism: Albert Schreiber and Carol Steinberg.20 Like Ludo and poet Benjamin Fondane, the Fronda group represented those Romanian Jewish aficionados in Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i who followed the Symbolist-modernist school of Arghezi, and who promoted Arghezi's poetry in northern Romania: Fronda{{'}}s writers were noted for saluting Via&lt;U+0163&gt;a Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt; when it too began hosting poems by Arghezi.21
Fronda put out three issues in all, after which time Relgis became an occasional contributor to more circulated periodicals, among them Rampa (founded by Arghezi and the socialist agitator N. D. Cocea) and Viea&lt;U+0163&gt;a Nou&lt;U+0103&gt; (led by Symbolist critic Ovid Densusianu).22 In 1913, he collected his loose philosophical essays, or &quot;fantasies&quot;, in the volume Triumful nefiin&lt;U+0163&gt;ei (&quot;The Triumph of Non-Being&quot;).232425 He published his first two books of poems during World War I, but before the end of Romania's neutrality period. The first one was a collection of sonnets, Sonetele nebuniei (&quot;Sonnets of Madness&quot;), printed at Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i in 1914; the second was published in the capital, Bucharest, as Nebunia (&quot;Madness&quot;).26 Some of these poems were illustrated with drawings in Relgis' own hand.2728
From Umanitatea to M&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntuirea
After training in architecture, Relgis was enrolled at the University of Bucharest, where he took courses in Philosophy.2930 During the period, he first left Romania on a trip to the Ottoman Empire and Kingdom of Greece.31 He interrupted his studies shortly after Romania entered the war, in the second half of 1916.32 Back in Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i after the Central Powers stormed into southern Romania, he was reportedly drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, but refused to take up arms as a conscientious objector; briefly imprisoned as a result, he was in the end discharged for his deafness.33
Resuming his publishing activity upon the end of war, Eugen Relgis began publicizing his humanitarianist and pacifist agenda. In summer 1918, Relgis became one of the contributors to the Ia&lt;U+015F&gt;i-based review Umanitatea (&quot;The Humanity&quot; or &quot;The Human Race&quot;). Historian Lucian Boia, who notes that Umanitatea was published when Romania's temporary defeat seemed to announce sweeping political reforms, believes that the magazine mainly reflected the &quot;nebulous&quot; agenda of a senior editor, the Bessarabian journalist Alexis Nour.34 In addition to Relgis and Nour, Umanitatea enlisted contributions from Ludo and Avram Steuerman-Rodion.35 The short-lived magazine, Boia writes, supported land reform, labor rights and, unusually in the context of &quot;pronounced Romanian antisemitism&quot;, Jewish emancipation.36 On his own, Relgis published a magazine of the same title, issued during 1920.373839 According to one account, Umanitatea was closed down by Romania's military censorship, which kept a check on radical publications.4041 In 1921, an unsigned chronicle in the Cluj-based G&lt;U+00E2&gt;ndirea journal recognized in Relgis &quot;the kind and enthusiastic young man who was propagating [...] the religion of man through Umanitatea magazine&quot;.42
Relgis resumed his literary activity early in the interwar period. He authored his ideological essay Literatura r&lt;U+0103&gt;zboiului &lt;U+015F&gt;i era nou&lt;U+0103&gt; (Bucharest, 1919); another such piece, Umanitarism sau Interna&lt;U+0163&gt;ionala intelectualilor (&quot;Humanitarianism or the Intellectuals' Internationale&quot;), taken up by Via&lt;U+0163&gt;a Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt; in 1922.434445 Via&lt;U+0163&gt;a Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt; also published Relgis' abridged translation of The Biology of War, a pacifist treatise by German physician Georg Friedrich Nicolai.46 1922 witnessed the birth of Relgis' manifesto Principiile umanitariste (&quot;Humanitarianist Principles&quot;), which offered Relgis' own conclusions on world peace, while reaffirming the need to create an international pacifist forum of intellectuals.47484950 It carried a preface by Nicolai.51
Relgis also set up the First Humanitarianist Group of Romania,52535455 as well as a leftist library, Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea (&quot;Freedom Circle Library&quot;).5657 Joined in such efforts by the veteran anarchists Han Ryner and Panait Mu&lt;U+015F&gt;oiu,58 Relgis also circulated an Apel c&lt;U+0103&gt;tre to&lt;U+0163&gt;i intelectualii liberi &lt;U+015F&gt;i muncitorii lumina&lt;U+0163&gt;i (&quot;Appeal to All the Free Intellectuals and the Enlightened Workers&quot;).59 Before 1932, the Humanitarianist Group created some 23 regional branches in Greater Romania.60 Beginning 1925, Relgis also represented Romanian pacifists within the War Resisters' International.61626364
In the meantime, he continued to publish sporadic poems, such as Ascetism (&quot;Asceticism&quot;), featured in G&lt;U+00E2&gt;ndirea.65 The year 1923 witnessed the beginnings of a friendship between Relgis and the aspiring pacifist author George Mihail Zamfirescu. Relgis prefaced Zamfirescu's book Flamura alb&lt;U+0103&gt; (&quot;The White Flag&quot;), and contributed to Zamfirescu's magazine Icoane Maramure&lt;U+015F&gt;ene (&quot;Maramure&lt;U+015F&gt; Icons&quot;).66 A prose volume, Peregrin&lt;U+0103&gt;ri (&quot;Wanderings&quot;), saw print with Editura Socec the same year.67 Relgis also published, in 1924, the 3 volumes of his main novel Petru Arbore (a Bildungsroman named after its main protagonist).68 Two new volumes of his topical essays saw print in later years: the first one, published by the printing offices of fellow journalist Barbu Br&lt;U+0103&gt;ni&lt;U+015F&gt;teanu, was Umanitarism &lt;U+015F&gt;i socialism (&quot;Humanitarianism and Socialism&quot;, 1925); the second, printed in 1926, was titled Umanitarismul biblic (&quot;Humanitarianism in the Bible&quot;).6970 His press activity included contributions to Zionist papers: a writer for &lt;U+015E&gt;tiri din Lumea Evreiasc&lt;U+0103&gt;, he was also briefly on the staff of Zissu's M&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntuirea.71
Sbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul and Umanitarismul
Also during the early 1920s, Eugen Relgis came into contact with the Bucharest-based Sbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul circle, which stood for modernist literature and aesthetic relativism. The eponymous magazine published samples of his lyrical poetry.72 With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many Sbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul factions, as later noted by literary historian Ovid Crohm&lt;U+0103&gt;lniceanu in discussing the studied eclecticism of Sbur&lt;U+0103&gt;torul doyen Eugen Lovinescu.73 Another Romanian researcher, Henri Zalis, notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of ethno-nationalist discrimination.74 Relgis' contribution to Romanian literature was renewed in 1926, when he published Melodiile t&lt;U+0103&gt;cerii (&quot;Melodies of Silence&quot;) and the collection Poezii (&quot;Poems&quot;), followed in 1927 by Glasuri &lt;U+00EE&gt;n surdin&lt;U+0103&gt; (&quot;Muted Voices&quot;).75 The latter novel, later republished with a foreword by Austrian author Stefan Zweig,767778 chronicled Relgis' own difficulties with his post-lingual deafness.79
At that stage in his career, Eugen Relgis was also a contributor to the Bucharest left-wing dailies Adev&lt;U+0103&gt;rul and Diminea&lt;U+0163&gt;a, part of a new generation of radical or pacifist authors cultivated by the newspaper (alongside Zamfirescu, Ion Marin Sadoveanu and various others).80 His pieces for Adev&lt;U+0103&gt;rul include insights into medical sociology, such as the September 1922 &lt;U+00CE&gt;napoi, la biologie! (&quot;Back to Biology!&quot;).81 The Adev&lt;U+0103&gt;rul publishing house issued his 1925 translation of Knut Hamsun's story Slaves of Love.82 At around the same time, the C&lt;U+0103&gt;minul Library, publishers of popular education books, issued Relgis' translation from Thus Spoke Zarathustra, the classic novel of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.83 It endured as one of two Romanian-language versions of Nietzsche's main works to be published before the 1970s, together with George B. Rate&lt;U+015F&gt;'s The Antichrist.84 Relgis' work as a translator also included versions of writings by Zweig, &lt;U+00C9&gt;mile Armand, Selma Lagerl&lt;U+00F6&gt;f, Emil Ludwig and Jakob Wassermann.8586
After editing the short-lived gazette Cugetul Liber (&quot;Freethought&quot;),878889 Eugen Relgis put out the political and cultural review Umanitarismul (&quot;Humanitarianism&quot;). It enlisted contributions from the Romanian writers Ion Barbu, Alexandru Al. Philippide and Ion Vinea, and was positively reviewed by other cultural figures (Tudor Arghezi, Enric Furtun&lt;U+0103&gt;, Meyer Abraham Halevy, Perpessicius).90 He published his work in a variety of periodicals, from Vinea's modernist mouthpiece Contimporanul,91 Ludo's Adam review9293 and the Zionist Cuv&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntul Nostru to the Romanian traditionalist journal Cuget Clar.94 With his publishing house Editura Umanitatea, Relgis also contributed a 1929 book of interviews, based on texts previously featured in Umanitarismul: Anchet&lt;U+0103&gt; asupra interna&lt;U+0163&gt;ionalei pacifiste (&quot;An Inquiry about the Pacifist International&quot;).95 The same year, Relgis lectured at the Zionist Avodah circle about the opportunities of Jewish return to the Land of Israel.96
Travels abroad and &lt;U+015E&gt;antier affiliation
The Romanian writer traveled extensively to promote his ideas of social change. By 1928, he was in regular correspondence with French writer and human rights activist Romain Rolland, who answered in writing to Relgis' various inquiries.97 He was a delegate to pacifist reunions in Hoddesdon, England and Sonntagberg, Austria (1928).9899 Relgis also exchanged letters with various other prestigious left-wing intellectuals: Zweig, Upton Sinclair, Henri Barbusse, Max Nettlau etc.100101 His various inquiries also enlisted positive replies from other international supporters of pacifism: physicist Albert Einstein, biologist Auguste Forel, writer Heinrich Mann and anarchist militant Paul Reclus.102 He became a contributor to Sebastien Faure's Anarchist Encyclopedia, with the &quot;Humanitarianism&quot; entry.103 In 1929, Delpeuch company published his French-language essay L'Internationale pacifiste (&quot;The Pacifist International&quot;),104 reissued the same year in Valencia, Spain, as La Internacional Pacifista.105106
Around 1930, Relgis was in Paris, where he met with Han Ryner,107 and in Berlin, where he conversed with his mentor Nicolai.108 In its new translated editions, Apel c&lt;U+0103&gt;tre... was signed by a number of leading pacifist intellectuals of various persuasions, among them Zweig, Sinclair, Barbusse, Campio Carpio, Manuel Devald&lt;U+00E8&gt;s, Phil&lt;U+00E9&gt;as Lebesgue, Rabindranath Tagore.109 While in France, where his work was notably popularized by L'EnDehors magazine and G&lt;U+00E9&gt;rard de Lacaze-Duthiers's Biblioth&lt;U+00E8&gt;que de l'Artistocratie book collection,110111 he was for a while close to Barbusse's Clart&lt;U+00E9&gt; circle, but left it after discovering its communist militancy and Soviet connections.112 His Intellectuals' Internationale therefore took distance from both the Comintern.113
In 1932, he published the German-language collection of interviews Wege zum Friede (&quot;Path toward Peace&quot;).114 His other travels into Bulgaria, where he represented Romanian vegetarians at an international congress, were discussed in his 1933 volume Bulgaria necunoscut&lt;U+0103&gt; (&quot;Unknown Bulgaria&quot;).115116 The volume Cosmomet&lt;U+00E1&gt;polis, about the creation of a world government,117 was first published in Bucharest by Cultura Poporului imprint, and reissued in Paris by Mignolet et Storz.118
Relgis' participation in left-wing causes was attacked at home by the antisemitic and proto-fascist National Christian Defense League, whose press organ &lt;U+00CE&gt;nfr&lt;U+0103&gt;&lt;U+0163&gt;irea Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt; alleged that &quot;squire Siegler&quot; and his Umanitarismul, together with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, were fostering communist agitation.119 After the 1933 establishment of a Nazi regime in Germany, Relgis' books of interviews became subject to ceremonial burnings.120
By that moment in his career, Relgis became a contributor to Vremea newspaper and to Ion Pas' political and art magazine, &lt;U+015E&gt;antier.121 The latter periodical was close to the Romanian Social Democratic Party, and had a strongly anti-fascist agenda.122 It published, in 1932, the Relgis essay Europa cea t&lt;U+00E2&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt; (&quot;Young Europe&quot;), which talked about civilization, imperialism and war.123 Relgis' contributions to &lt;U+015E&gt;antier also include a January 12, 1934 essay about &quot;anonymous works&quot; and their impact on art history, which was later quoted in Via&lt;U+0163&gt;a Rom&lt;U+00E2&gt;neasc&lt;U+0103&gt;.124 The same year, Relgis published the novel Prieteniile lui Miron (&quot;Miron's Friendships&quot;) with Editura Cugetarea.125126
In his subsequent activity as a journalist and publisher, Relgis combined his humanitarianism with topical interests. He was by then an advocate of eugenics, an interest reflected in his 1934 (or 1935) tract Umanitarism &lt;U+015F&gt;i eugenism (&quot;Humanitarianism and Eugenism&quot;), published by Editura Vegetarianismul company.127 In 1936, he also released the collection Esseuri despre iudaism (&quot;Essays on Judaism&quot;) with Cultura Poporului.128129130131 He was at the time active within the Jewish Cultural Institute, an annex of the Bucharest Choral Temple.132 His international activity peaked during the Spanish Civil War, when he helped organize anarchist support for the Spanish Republican regime, elected Councilor of the International Antifascist Solidarity.133
World War II, persecution and departure
Eugen Relgis was still active on the literary scene during the first two years of World War II, before Romania formalized its military alliance with the Axis Powers. The Phoney War caught him in France, but he returned to Romania shortly after, exposing himself to persecution by the growing Romanian fascist movements.134 In February 1940, he gave a retrospective lecture, republished by the newspaper L'Ind&lt;U+00E9&gt;pendence Roumaine, on the work of Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.135 Another book of his political prose, Spiritul activ (&quot;The Active Spirit&quot;), saw print the same year.136
The emergence of antisemitic and fascist regimes (see Romania in World War II, Holocaust in Romania) signified the beginning of Relgis' marginalization. During the short-lived National Legionary State, established by the Iron Guard fascists between 1940 and early 1941, the author lived in seclusion.137 His Biblioteca Cercului Libertatea was banned in 1940, but Relgis secretly moved the books into a stable.138 After the Guard fell from power, the Ion Antonescu dictatorship still included Relgis on a nationally-circulated list of banned Romanian Jewish authors,139 but Relgis continued to write. His texts of the time include a posthumous praise of his pacifist disciple Iosif Gutman, the son of a Bucharest rabbi, who had been killed during the Bucharest pogrom.140141 The essay was planned as part of Rabbi Gutman's volume Slove de martiri (&quot;Notes by Martyrs&quot;), which, although anti-Guard, was not given Antonescu's imprimatur.142 Relgis was however able to publish an article in the Jewish-only magazine Rena&lt;U+015F&gt;terea Noastr&lt;U+0103&gt;, on the occasion of Iosif's yahrtzeit, where he compared the Gutmans to Laoco&lt;U+00F6&gt;n and His Sons.143 Relgis' own son fled Romania in 1942, and settled in Argentina.144
A final period in Relgis' Romanian activity came after the August 1944 Coup toppled Antonescu and denounced Romania's Axis alliance. In 1945, he was dedicated a public celebration at the Jewish Cultural Institute, which included a speech by Chief Rabbi Alexandru &lt;U+015E&gt;afran.145 Slove de martiri was eventually published that year,146 and a revised Romanian edition of Petru Arbore saw print in 1946.147 Also then, he completed work on an essay about Nazism, The Holocaust and sexuality: Eros &lt;U+00EE&gt;n al treilea Reich (&quot;Eros in the Third Reich&quot;).148 Relgis was again active in the political press, lending his signature to several independent newspapers: Sebastian &lt;U+015E&gt;erbescu's Semnalul, Tudor Teodorescu-Brani&lt;U+015F&gt;te's Jurnalul de Diminea&lt;U+0163&gt;&lt;U+0103&gt; etc.149 He described himself as diametrically opposed to the process of communization, as well as to the Soviet occupation of Romania.150
With refugee status,151 having reportedly been singled out for arrest by the Romanian Communist Party officials,152 Relgis departed from Romania in 1947, shortly before the communist regime took hold. After a brief stay in Paris,153 he spent some time in Argentina, with his son and his female companion Ana Taubes.154 He later went to Montevideo, in Uruguay, where he lived the remainder of his life.155156157158159 At home, his works were included in an official Publica&lt;U+0163&gt;ii interzise (&quot;Works Forbidden from Publishing&quot;) list, published by the communist censorship apparatus.160
During his last decades, Eugen Relgis dedicated himself to sociological research and political activism. He embarked on a series of university lectures, which carried him throughout Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil.161162 In 1950, he founded an international anarchist archive in Montevideo, reportedly one of the few political libraries in South America at the time of its creation.163 The effort was supported by the exiled Spanish anarchist Abraham Guill&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, and received documentary funds from Europe, but reputedly drew suspicion from Uruguay police forces, and was consequently shut down.164
South American career
With noted help from anarchist translator Vladimiro Mu&lt;U+00F1&gt;oz,165 Relgis began his new career as a Spanish-language writer and publicist with a succession of works. Umanitarism &lt;U+015F&gt;i eugenism was translated into a Spanish edition: Humanitarismo y eugenismo, Ediciones Universo, Toulouse, 1950.166167168 The same imprint released his essay Las aberraciones sexuales en la Alemania nazi (&quot;Sexual Aberrations in Nazi Germany&quot;), which discussed in some depth the characteristics of Nazi eugenics.169 Also in 1950, with his Montevideo printing office Ediciones Humanidad, Relgis released a Spanish edition of his Principiile, a version of Max Nettlau's World Peace volume,170 as well as reissuing Cosmomet&lt;U+00E1&gt;polis.171 Two years later, Ediciones Humanidad published Relgis' biographical essay Stefan Zweig, cazador de almas (&quot;Stefan Zweig, the Soul Hunter&quot;), followed in 1953 by a Hachette version of De mis peregrinaciones europeas (&quot;From My Wanderings in Europe&quot;).172173 Relgis also tried to get his contributions translated into Portuguese, asking anarchist philosopher Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Oiticica for assistance.174 He was at the time employed by El Plata daily, editing its Wednesday literary page, and helping to discover, in 1954, the twelve-year poetess Teresa Porzecanski.175
In 1954, Relgis printed another biographical study, on Romain Rolland: El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria (&quot;A Free Man Confronts Totalitarian Barbarity&quot;).176177178 The following year, he gave a public lecture at the University of the Republic, titled &quot;A Writer's Confession&quot;, and reissued Esseuri despre iudaism as Profetas y poetas. Valores permanentes y temporarios del juda&lt;U+00ED&gt;smo (&quot;Prophets and Poets. The Permanent and Timely Values of Judaism&quot;).179180181182183 A Spanish version of Umanitarism sau Interna&lt;U+0163&gt;ionala intelectualilor was published, as El Humanitarismo, by Editorial Americalee in Buenos Aires (1956).184185 One edition of the latter was prefaced by Nicolai, who was at the time living in Argentina.186 In November of 1956, the same company issued Relgis' Diario de oto&lt;U+00F1&gt;o (&quot;Autumn Diary&quot;), a collection of notes he had kept during the war years.187 Another tract, Albores de libertad (&quot;Dawns of Freedom&quot;), was prefaced by Rudolf Rocker, the anarcho-syndicalist thinker.188
In 1958, the University of the Republic published Eugen Relgis' acclaimed political essay Perspectivas culturales en Sudam&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica (&quot;Cultural Perspectives in South America&quot;), for which he received a prize from the Uruguayan Ministry of Public Instruction and Social Prevision.189 Relgis' reputation was consolidated in the intellectual circles and, in 1955, his name was unsuccessfully advanced for the Nobel Peace Prize.190191192193194 The same year, a volume of his collected Spanish texts and studies on his work was published in Montevideo, as Homenaje a Eugen Relgis en su 60&lt;U+00BA&gt; aniversario (&quot;Homage to Eugen Relgis on His 60th Anniversary&quot;).195196
Relgis returned to poetry in 1960 and 1961, with the volumes En un lugar de los Andes (&quot;Some Place in the Andes&quot;) and Locura (&quot;Madness&quot;), both translated by Pablo R. Troise.197 They were followed by two other booklets, also in Troise's translation: Corazones y motores (&quot;Hearts and Engines&quot;, 1963), &lt;U+00DA&gt;ltimos poemas (&quot;The Last Poems&quot;, 1967).198 His complete Obras (&quot;Works&quot;) were published over the next decades,199 while the essay &lt;U+00BF&gt;Qu&lt;U+00E9&gt; es el humanitarismo? Principios y acci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n (&quot;What Is Humanitarianism? Principles and Action&quot;) went through several successive editions200 and featured a prologue by Albert Einstein.201 Another one of Relgis' Spanish-language volumes, Testigo de mi tiempo (&quot;A Witness of My Time&quot;), with more essays on Judaism, came in 1961.202 His leading eugenics and sexology treatise, Historia sexual de la Humanidad (&quot;The Sexual History of Humanity&quot;), was also published in 1961 (Libro-Mex Editores, Mexico City),203 and, in 1965, his biography of Nicolai saw print in Buenos Aires.204
Final years and death
In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and Jerusalem, tightening his links with the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David &lt;U+015E&gt;afran.205 It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native Romanian language: M&lt;U+0103&gt;rturii de ieri &lt;U+015F&gt;i de azi (&quot;Testimonies of Yesterday and Today&quot;).206 In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.207
From the early 1960s, Relgis was in correspondence with figures in the Italian radical circles, such as the anarchist Gaspare Mancuso.208209210 In 1964, Mancuso and Regis' other Italian disciples founded the political journal Quaderini degli amici di Eugen Relgis (&quot;The Friends of Eugen Relgis Notebooks&quot;).211212 He also became an occasional contributor to Mujeres Libres, the Spanish anarcha-feminist tribune in the United Kingdom.213 During the 1960s and '70s, as a spell of liberalization occurred in Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+015F&gt;escu's Romania, Relgis was again in contact with Romanian intellectuals. Before the massive earthquake of 1977 devastated Bucharest, he was in regular correspondence with scholar Mircea Handoca.214
Eugen Relgis lived the final decade of his life as a pensioner of the Uruguayan state&lt;U+2014&gt;in 1985, a law raised his pensi&lt;U+00F3&gt;n graciable to 20,000 new pesos a month.215 In the 1980s, Relgis was exchanging letters with Romanian cultural historian Leon Volovici, and entertained thoughts about a recovery of his work by Romanian critics and historians.216 He died before this could happen, in Montevideo, at age 92.
Political doctrine
Main ideas
Throughout his career, Relgis was the proponent of anarchism. The Romanian writer spoke about the negativity of &quot;state fetishism&quot;, seeking to overturn it and create &quot;universal fraternity&quot;,217 and, in Diario de oto&lt;U+00F1&gt;o, postulated a necessary distinction between Law (&quot;which may be interpreted for or against&quot;) and Justice (&quot;elementary&quot; and unavoidable).218 Relgis likewise believed that war could be overcome once humanity shall have toppled &quot;the three idols: State, Property, Money.&quot;219 Political philosopher &lt;U+00C1&gt;ngel Cappelletti argues: &quot;Relgis was not an anarchist militant, but was always close to libertarian ideas&quot;.220
According to Stefan Zweig, Relgis fought &quot;tirelessly for the great goal of spiritual fraternity.&quot;221 The sentiment was echoed by Romain Rolland, who recognized in Relgis his disciple: &quot;There is no other European man in whose hands I could place, with as much confidence, [...] my pacifist and universalist idea, for it to be passed on into the future. For none other has such far-reaching intelligence to this goal, and none other would feel this idea so intimately connected to his being.&quot;222 Speaking from the cultural mainstream, Romanian literary historian George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu observed Relgis' anti-establishment and anti-artistic rhetoric, but described it as mere &quot;idealist reverie&quot;, &quot;without any daring proposals that would threaten our self-preservation instincts&quot;.223 Contrarily, scholar William Rose sees Relgis as &quot;an idealist deeply preoccupied by social problems&quot;, &quot;a practical and not a utopian thinker&quot;, and a theorist aware that social or economic evolution was needed before his goals could be achieved.224
Relgis' humanitarianism (also known as humanism or pan-humanism; )225 was a practical extension of anarcho-pacifism. William Rose describes this doctrine as both &quot;universalist and pacifist&quot;, noting that one of its leading purposes was to eliminate those things &quot;which separate man from man and cause wars&quot;.226 Relgis himself spoke of his movement as a form of &quot;active thought&quot;, and &quot;a critical method applied to natural, human and social realities&quot;,227 while expressing admiration for the nonviolent resistance tactics advocated in British India by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or Rabindranath Tagore.228229 At the time, he attacked all forms of pan-nationalism, from Pan-Germanism to Pan-European nationalism, defining pan-humanism as &quot;the only 'pan' that can be accepted as a natural law of the human species&quot;.230 In El humanitarismo, he called all internationalist movements, except his own, corrupted by &quot;the practice of violence and intolerance&quot;.231
Writing in 1933, the leftist literary columnist Ion Clopo&lt;U+0163&gt;el stressed that Relgis' vision combined humanitarianism with &quot;a lively, dynamic and innovating socialism&quot;.232 Although left-wing, Relgis vision also included militant anti-communism. As noted by literary historian Geo &lt;U+015E&gt;erban, he was from early on skeptical about the outcome of &quot;social revolutions&quot; and Bolshevik insurgency.233 In the first issue of Umanitarianismul, Relgis criticized both the far right and the far left, noting that his ideology was &quot;apolitical, in fact antipolitical&quot;.234 In Europa cea t&lt;U+00E2&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;, he referred to the Soviet Union as the home of &quot;proletarian imperialism&quot;.235 These thoughts were detailed by Diario de oto&lt;U+00F1&gt;o, which drew a direct comparison between the Red Army, pushing Romania into an &quot;armed peace&quot;, and the Wehrmacht.236
Judaism, Zionism, Jewish culture
Beginning in the late 1920s, Relgis was also a supporter of Zionism, convinced that the path of Jewish assimilation was unsatisfactory for the affirmation of Jewish talents.237 He also adhered to philosopher Martin Buber's ideas about reuniting the three paths chosen by diaspora Jews: universalism, Zionism and Conservative Judaism.238 In his 1929 Avodah conference, he analyzed the ongoing Jewish resettlement into the Land of Israel, and investigated the causes of violent clashes between Jewish migrants and the Palestine Arabs.239 In other public statements, Relgis proudly stated his Judaic faith, noting that he had never actually left Judaism, &quot;being integrated into its vast reality by the very reality of my own preoccupations, sociological and ethical, humanitarianist and pacifist.&quot;240 However, he explained to Iosif Gutman that joining a Zionist organization was not worth the effort, since membership was a form of captivity, and elsewhere suggested that Zionism was justified only as long as it did not follow &quot;the restrictive methods of vulgar nationalism.&quot;241 The writer also described himself as committed to Romanian culture, and, as late as 1981, noted that Romanian was still his language of choice.242
His essays on Judaism (some of which were dedicated to his father David)243244 speak about the threat of societal collapse, which the author connected with mankind's spiritual decline after World War I. His theory on &quot;dehumanization&quot; postulated: &quot;the spiritual evolution of mankind has proceeded to descent just as mankind is progressing in material terms.&quot;245 As a reversal of this trend, Relgis proposed a return to the roots of Judaism, in whose monotheism and Messianism he decoded the basic representation of moral responsibility, and the immediate precursors of Christianity.246247 The Romanian writer was interested in those aspects of Jewish ethics which anticipated humanitarianism or pacifism, citing the Bible as &quot;that most humane book&quot;, and identifying himself with the lament of Malachi 2:10 (&quot;Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?&quot;).248 He later wrote that Jews, and Israelis in particular, were entrusted with keeping alive &quot;the ancient wisdom, poetry and faith&quot;, with creating &quot;new values from the old ones&quot;.249 Defining in his own terms the relationship between Biblical proto-universalism and 20th century humanitarianism, Relgis wrote: &quot;Judaism is comprised into modern humanitarianism like a flame within a crystal globe.&quot;250251252
In tandem, he rejected those aspects of Judaism or Christianity which he believed where bigotry, and his pacifist discourse criticized all religions as potential instigators or ideological props of hawkish rhetoric.253254 He reserved special criticism for the notions of a &quot;vengeful God&quot; and &quot;Jewish chosenness&quot;, arguing that they are &quot;primitive&quot;, and expressed more sympathy for Buddhist universalism.255 His texts, including the 1922 Apel c&lt;U+0103&gt;tre..., are thought be some to be purposefully using universalist Masonic vocabulary.256
Relgis' Judaic-themed tracts cover a wide range of subjects. In several of them, Relgis concentrates on the Biblical prophet Moses, in whom he sees the symbol of &quot;great human aspirations&quot;.257 Some texts trace the impact of Moses' teaching on more modern authors (from Baruch Spinoza to Charles Darwin), others talk about secular Jewish culture, and still others focus on individual Jewish personalities: Buber, Edmond Fleg, Theodor Herzl.258 As a critic, he also investigated the survival of ancient Judaic themes in the modern art of Marcel Janco, Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r Zin or Reuven Rubin, and in the literature of Zweig, S. Ansky, Mendele Mocher Sforim and even Marcel Proust.259 Other such writings are individual portraits of Romanian Jewish men of letters, from A. L. Zissu and Iosif Bruc&lt;U+01CE&gt;r to Avram Steuerman-Rodion and Enric Furtun&lt;U+0103&gt;.260 According to Geo &lt;U+015E&gt;erban, Relgis spent much of his later career promoting &quot;a more fertile awareness of the links between Judaism and the modern world.&quot;261
A critic of antisemitism, Eugen Relgis also dedicated some of his main works in the essay genre to the cause of anti-fascism. Early on, he exposed claims about Judeo-Masonic domination as canards, and noted that antisemitism was a negative reaction to the Jews' own status as natural innovators in both politics and culture.262 He wrote: &quot;I take antisemitism to be that psychological disease whose manifestations display the characteristics of a phobia, that is to say an obsession. When someone is obsessed with an image, an individual or even a collective entity, these become the center of their world&lt;U+2014&gt;and all causes and effects, no matter how far apart and different from each other, are connected to the initial obsession.&quot;263264
Writing in 1946, shortly after the scale of The Holocaust became known to Romanian Jews, Relgis gave credit to the popular, but since challenged rumor that Nazis fabricated human soap.265 Historian of ideas Andrei Oi&lt;U+015F&gt;teanu analyzes Relgis' text as more of a reaction to Nazism's own obsessive take on cleanliness, and writes that, at that time, Jews and Christians in Romania had been collecting certain brands of German soap and burying them as human remains.266
On Latin America
After his move to Uruguay, Relgis developed a personal theory on Latin America as a &quot;neohumanist&quot; continent.267 Earlier, in Europa cea t&lt;U+00E2&gt;n&lt;U+0103&gt;r&lt;U+0103&gt;, Relgis had claimed that the European continent needed to revisit its &quot;pathetic history&quot; of violence and imperialism, and reconvert by combining the lessons of Eastern philosophy and United States models of industrialization.268 Both models, he warned, carried risks: Asia's &quot;spiritual renunciations&quot; were mirrored by a &quot;cancer of machinism&quot; in North America.269
With Perspectivas culturales en Sudam&lt;U+00E9&gt;rica, he expanded on a distinction between civilization and culture: the former as a transitory phase in human development, the latter as a permanent and characteristic sum of ideas; civilization, he argued, was in existence within the New World, but a Latin American culture was still ahead.270 Relgis identified this as a merit, describing South America in general and Uruguay in particular as exceptionally fertile and a &quot;healthier&quot; example for the whole world, offering safe haven to independent thinkers and defying the ideological divisions of the Cold War era.271 Summarizing the future links between the Latin American regions and Europe as envisaged by Relgis, William Rose wrote: &quot;the cultural mission of America consists in a careful selection of the eternal and universal values of Europe and their assimilation [...] to create typically American values that later, transcending the limits of this continent, will carry their message of peace and fraternity to the entire world.&quot;272 Latin America, Relgis cautioned, should leave behind its own traditions of dictatorial government, fanaticism and &quot;utilitarian mentality&quot;, while fighting the &quot;false moral&quot; of North America; it could thus contribute to the cultural renaissance of a Europe corrupted by totalitarianism and imperialism.273 Also important in Relgis' assessment was Latin America's capacity to resist modern dehumanization by granting a social role to its intellectuals, an idea impressed upon him by the writings of Uruguayan humanist Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Enrique Rod&lt;U+00F3&gt;.274
Relgis' theory was received with interest by some of his South American colleagues. One was Argentine poet and historian Arturo Capdevila, who wrote about Relgis as a &quot;meritorious&quot; visionary with a &quot;grave and vital message&quot;, assuring him: &quot;You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied.&quot;275 Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included Socialist Party leader Emilio Frugoni, Colorado Party politician Am&lt;U+00ED&gt;lcar Vasconcellos, Zionist academic Joel Gak and poet Carlos Sabat Ercasty.276 While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of Antigone, Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with &quot;the constricting reality&quot;.277 Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Courtoisie calls Relgis &quot;eccentric and genial&quot;, and likens him to the unlikely protagonists of Jorge Luis Borges' fantasy literature.278
Eugenics
Like other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of &quot;social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement.&quot;279 Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for eugenics, advocating universal birth control and compulsory sterilization in cases of &quot;degeneration&quot;.280281282 According to Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Courtoisie: &quot;Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]&quot;.283 In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated neo-Malthusians, and especially with Manuel Devald&lt;U+00E8&gt;s. He praised Devald&lt;U+00E8&gt;s' call for vasectomy as a regulatory practice, calling the procedure &quot;a true revolution&quot; in population growth.284 His works defended other anarchists who recommended the practice, including the tried anarchist eugenists Norbert Bardoseck and Pierre Ramus.285 According to Romanian biomedicine historian Marius Turda, Relgis was among the social scientists who, in 1930s Romania, &quot;forced [eugenic sterilization] into the realm of public debate&quot;.286
Turda also notes that Umanitarism &lt;U+015F&gt;i eugenism went beyond sterilization advocacy to propose the involuntary euthanasia of &quot;degenerate&quot; individuals: those with &quot;pathological characteristics or incurable diseases.&quot;287 Relgis' call to action in eugenics came with a provision: &quot;It is, however, preferable, from all points of view, that degenerates should not be born, or, even better, not conceived.&quot;288 His views on this subject included an economic rationale, since, he argued, the community could not be expected to provide for sexually &quot;prolific&quot;, but otherwise &quot;degenerate&quot;, individuals.289 To this goal, he supported abortion, both for eugenic and pro-choice reasons.290 Relgis also argued: &quot;Instead of natural selection, man should practice rational selection.&quot;291 With 292 With Las aberraciones sexuales..., Relgis condemned Nazi eugenics as barbaric, but agreed that those identified as &quot;sub-humans&quot; needed to be reeducated and (if &quot;incurable&quot;) sterilized by non-Nazi physicians.293
In this context, Relgis identified multiracial society as a positive paradigm. The emergence of an exemplary Latin American culture was conceived by Relgis as running parallel to a future American racial type. In this, Relgis saw the &quot;integral man&quot; of his humanitarianism, &quot;healthy and strong&quot;, with a mind unbound by &quot;super-refined culture&quot;, and without the traumatic experience of &quot;tyrannical ideologies&quot;.294 The idea, Rose noted, was somewhat similar to, but &quot;more universal&quot; than, the Cosmic Race theory of Mexican academic Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Vasconcelos.295
Literary contribution
Literary style and principles
Eugen Relgis blended a critique of capitalism, advocacy of internationalism and modern art interest with all his main contributions to literature. In his essays and &quot;all too cerebral&quot; novels, George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu argues, Eugen Relgis was &quot;obsessed with humanitarianism&quot; and self-help techniques.296 With his 1934 piece for &lt;U+015E&gt;antier, Relgis divided the experience and nature of art into a primordial, collective, form and a newer, individualist one: in the past, Relgis noted, creativity was consumed into creating vast anonymous works (&quot;the pyramid, the temple, the cathedral&quot;), often demanding &quot;the silent and tenacious effort of successive generations.&quot;297 Presently, he thought, the combat against the &quot;imperative of Profit&quot; and &quot;vulgar materialism&quot; justified the &quot;ethical and aesthetic individualism&quot;. Relgis' essay described industrial society in harsh terms, as directed by &quot;the bloody gods&quot; of &quot;Capitalism and War&quot;, and cautioned that the advocacy of anonymity in modern art could lead to kitsch (&quot;serialized production, without the significance it used to carry in bygone days&quot;).298 Elsewhere, however, Relgis also argued that books needed to have a formative value, and that literature, unlike journalism, &quot;needs to be the expression of length and depth.&quot;299
Some of Relgis' preferences were shaped from his time at Fronda. Its art manifestos, described by Paul Cernat as &quot;virtually illegible&quot;, announced radical ideals, such as art for art's sake through Neronian destruction: Qualis artifex pereo.300 Leon Baconsky, a historian of Romanian Symbolism, notes that all Frondistes were at the time enthusiastic followers of French literary theorist Remy de Gourmont, to whom Cernat adds philosopher Henri Bergson and Epicurean thinker Jean-Marie Guyau (both of them dedicated &quot;prolix-metaphoric commentary&quot; in the review's pages).301 In matters of poetics, the group declared its deep admiration for the loose Symbolism of Tudor Arghezi (whose poems were amply reviewed by all three Fronda issues) and, to a lesser extent, Ion Minulescu.302 Baconsky found that Fronda was the first-ever voice in literary criticism to comment on Arghezi's work as an integral phenomenon.303
The cause of pacifism infused Relgis' work as a writer: a contemporary, the literary critic Pompiliu P&lt;U+0103&gt;lt&lt;U+00E2&gt;nea, believed that, with his contribution to Romanian literature, Relgis was part of a diverse anti-war &quot;ideological&quot; group of writers (alongside Felix Aderca, Ioan Alexandru Br&lt;U+0103&gt;tescu-Voine&lt;U+015F&gt;ti, Barbu L&lt;U+0103&gt;z&lt;U+0103&gt;reanu and some others).304 According to C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu, Relgis' literary ideal became &quot;the living book&quot;, the immediate and raw rendition of an individual's experience, with such &quot;idols&quot; as Rolland, Zweig, Henri Barbusse, Heinrich Mann and Ludwig Rubiner.305 An additional influence was, according to poet-critic Boris Marian, European Expressionism, in fashion at the start of Relgis' career.306
In addition to political essays and fiction, Relgis' prose includes contributions to travel literature, deemed &quot;his most characteristic works&quot; by William Rose.307 These writings include attempts by Relgis to illustrate in plastic terms the application of his ideology: Ion Clopo&lt;U+0163&gt;el noted that, in his volume about interwar Bulgaria, Relgis went beyond the facade of &quot;savage&quot; Bulgarian militarism to depict the humanist, vegetarian and &quot;Tolstoyan&quot; civil society of that age.308 Bulgaria necunoscut&lt;U+0103&gt; also worked as a manifesto of anti-intellectualism, chastising the &quot;demagogue&quot; academics and praising the simplicity of &quot;collective life&quot;.309 In a similar way, Relgis' scattered memoirs, among them Str&lt;U+0103&gt;mo&lt;U+015F&gt;ul meu, &quot;David Gugumanul&quot; (&quot;My Ancestor, 'Nitwit David' &quot;), shed intimate light on his ideas about Judaism.310311
Other such didactic texts detail Relgis' advice on the art of living. Glasuri &lt;U+00EE&gt;n surdin&lt;U+0103&gt; is noted for depicting the disorientation of a young man who becomes deaf: Relgis' alter ego, Miron, finds that such a disability has turned his old friends into opportunistic exploiters, but his imaginative spirit and his (minutely chronicled) self-determination allow him to rebel and start over in life.312 However, deaf studies experts Trenton W. Batson and Eugene Bergman write, Miron &quot;is not really representative of the deaf majority&quot;, leading a life of isolation and, out of despair, seeking out a miracle cure for deafness.313 The Bildungsroman Petru Arbore is noted by Geo &lt;U+015E&gt;erban as a &quot;rarity&quot; in Romanian literature, &quot;instructive despite its excessive rhetoricism.&quot;314 Relgis himself warned that the book should not be seen as his autobiography, but as the &quot;spiritual mirror&quot; of each reader.315 Called a &quot;sweet volume of essays&quot; by Clopo&lt;U+0163&gt;el,316 Prieteniile lui Miron chronicles love and desire in relation to age and sex. The work shows a young girl losing and then regaining her faith in true love, a daring young man, &quot;who mistakes love for sport&quot;, being rejected by his female companions, and lastly a mature couple whose love has undergone the test of friendship.317 Clopo&lt;U+0163&gt;el praised the text for its &quot;seriousness&quot;, &quot;finesse&quot; and &quot;reflections enlightened by knowledge and responsibility&quot;, concluding: &quot;[This is] a literature of moral health.&quot;318
These characteristics were also discerned by critics in his various contributions to Latin American literature. Courtoisie found Diario de oto&lt;U+00F1&gt;o, a book that is &quot;miscellanious, multithematic, [moving] between the poetic and the everyday&quot;, comparable to the Fermentario essays of Uruguay's Carlos Vaz Ferreira.319 According to critic William T. Starr, El hombre libre frente a la barbarie totalitaria and other such recollections reveal &quot;more about Relgis than about Rolland&quot;.320
Poetry
During his time at Fronda, Eugen Relgis and his fellow writers published collective, experimental and unsigned poems, largely echoing the influence of Arghezi and Minulescu, but, according to Paul Cernat, &quot;aesthetically monstrous&quot;.321 This perspective is echoed by &lt;U+015E&gt;erban, who notes that Relgis' debut as a poet was largely without &quot;convincing results&quot;.322
With time, Relgis developed a style deemed &quot;the poetry of professions&quot; by George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu. According to C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu's classification, Relgis the poet is similar in this respect to fellow Symbolists Alexandru Tudor-Miu and Barbu Solacolu, but also to Simona Basarab, Leon Feraru, Cristian S&lt;U+00E2&gt;rbu and Stelian Constantin-Stelian.323 The same critic notes that Relgis &quot;attempted, with some beautiful poetic suggestions, to establish a modern-era mythology with abstract gods [...] and other machinist monsters.&quot;324 Relgis' poems, he notes, were individual portraits of industrial machinery (&quot;The Elevator&quot;, &quot;The Cement Mixer&quot;) or workers (&quot;The Builder&quot;, &quot;The Day Laborer&quot;), as temples and deities. By &quot;natural association&quot;, the critic notes, Relgis applied the same technique in his lyrical homages to the very large animals (&quot;The Giraffe&quot;, &quot;The Elephant&quot;), but &quot;this requires greater means of suggestion&quot;.325
In one piece quoted by George C&lt;U+0103&gt;linescu, Relgis showed a bricklayer contemplating the modern city from the top of a scaffolding structure:
 De sus, pe schelele u&lt;U+015F&gt;oare Ora&lt;U+015F&gt;ul &lt;U+00EE&gt;l cuprind &lt;U+00EE&gt;ntreg, Masiv &lt;U+015F&gt;i d&lt;U+00E2&gt;rz: &lt;U+2014&gt;enorm&lt;U+0103&gt; st&lt;U+00E2&gt;nc&lt;U+0103&gt; Ce-a fost ascuns&lt;U+0103&gt;-n noapte-ad&lt;U+00E2&gt;nc&lt;U+0103&gt;, &lt;U+015E&gt;i care s-a ivit sub soare Prin str&lt;U+0103&gt;duin&lt;U+0163&gt;i a mii de ani&lt;U+2014&gt; Urc&lt;U+00E2&gt;nd &lt;U+00EE&gt;ncet, ne&lt;U+00EE&gt;nfr&lt;U+00E2&gt;nat, Prin for&lt;U+0163&gt;a micilor titani.326 
 Up there, on flimsy scaffolds, I stare all across this city, Massive and daring: &lt;U+2014&gt;enormous rock That was hidden into deepest night And reemerged under the sun, Millennial efforts behind it&lt;U+2014&gt; Climbing slowly, ceaselessly, Fed by the force of tiny titans. 
Legacy
The political ideas of Eugen Relgis were largely incompatible with the totalitarianism prevalent in Romania between World War II and the Romanian Revolution of 1989: as Rose notes, the scholar was persecuted by &quot;four dictatorial regimes in his native country&quot;.327 Before this, &lt;U+015E&gt;erban writes, Relgis' intellectual contacts may have stimulated public debate, even though the writer himself could not claim the status of &quot;opinion maker&quot;.328 Likewise, Boris Marian describes Relgis as &quot;almost forgotten&quot; by Romanians after his self-exile.329 In addition to Iosif Gutman, Relgis' Jewish Romanian disciples included F&lt;U+0103&gt;lticeni journalist Iacob Bacalu, founder of a Relgis Circle.330 According to literary historians such as Victor Frunz&lt;U+0103&gt; and Al. S&lt;U+0103&gt;ndulescu, Relgis' targeting by communist censorship had a paradoxical antisemitic undertone, as one of the repressive measures which touched Jewish culture in general.331
Attempts to recover Relgis' work were made during the latter half of Romanian communist rule and after the 1989, several of them from within the Romanian Jewish community. In April 1982, the Jewish cultural journal Revista Cultului Mozaic published Leon Volovici's note about Relgis and Judaism.332333 Late in the 1980s, Volovici also contacted Relgis' surviving sisters, then Relgis himself, becoming curator of the manuscripts left behind by the philosopher upon his relocation to South America.334335 These were later donated to the Alexandru Al. Philippide Institute of the Romanian Academy, where they are kept as the Eugen Relgis library fund.336337
Relgis enjoys a more enduring reputation abroad. Initially, his anarchist eugenics enjoyed some popularity among Spanish anarchists;338339 his pacifism also inspired Lloren&lt;U+00E7&gt; Vidal Vidal, the Balearic poet and educator.340 Some of his tracts have been reissued after 2001, with the Anselmo Lorenzo Foundation (Confederaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Nacional del Trabajo).341 Italian-language versions of his novels, poems and political tracts, including Cosmomet&lt;U+00E1&gt;polis, were published by Gaspare Mancuso and his Libero Accordo group, over the 1960s and '70s.342
By then, Relgis' works had been translated into fourteen languages, although they still remained largely unknown in the United States;343 Principiile umanitariste alone had been translated into some 18 languages before 1982.344345 The popularization of Relgis' ideas in America was first taken up by reviews such as The Humanist and Books Abroad, while Oriole Press reprinted Muted Voices.346 A second revised edition of Profetas y poetas, prefaced by the Spanish intellectual Rafael Cansinos-Ass&lt;U+00E9&gt;ns, saw print in Montevideo (1981).347 At around the same time, in Mexico, his poems were being reprinted in Alfonso Cam&lt;U+00ED&gt;n's Norte literary review.348
In addition to the Philippide Insitute collection, part of Relgis' personal archive is being preserved in Jerusalem, at the National Library of Israel.349350351 His other notebooks and letters are kept in the Netherlands, at the International Institute of Social History.352353 Relgis' likeness is preserved in drawings by Marcel Janco,354355 Laz&lt;U+0103&gt;r Zin,356 Louis Moreau357 and Carmelo de Arzadun.358
