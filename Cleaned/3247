SMS Karlsruhe was a light cruiser of the Knigsberg class light cruiser 1915 Knigsberg class, built for the Kaiserliche Marine Imperial Navy during World War I. She was named after the earlier SMS Karlsruhe 1912 Karlsruhe, which had sunk in November 1914, from an accidental explosion. The new cruiser was laid down in 1914 at the Kaiserliche Werft Kiel Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel, launched in January 1916, and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in November 1916. Armed with eight 15 cm SK L/45 15&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns, the ship had a top speed of convert 27.5 kn abbr=on.
She saw relatively limited service during the war, due to her commissioning late in the conflict. She was present during a brief engagement with British light forces in August 1917, though she did not actively participate in the battle. She joined the large task force assigned to Operation Albion in October 1917, but did not see significant action during that operation either. She was assigned to what was to have been the final sortie of the High Seas Fleet in the closing days of the war, but a large-scale mutiny in significant parts of the fleet forced the cancellation of the plan. Karlsruhe was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war, and Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow scuttled there on 21 June 1919. Unlike most of the other ships sunk there, her wreck was never raised.
Construction
main Knigsberg class cruiser
Karlsruhe was ordered under the contract name Ersatz SMS Niobe 1899 2 and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft Kiel Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel in 1915. She was launched on 31 January 1916, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 15 November 1916. The ship was convert 151.4 m sp=us ftin length overall long overall and had a beam nautical beam of convert 14.2 m abbr=on ftin and a draft hull draft of convert 5.96 m abbr=on ftin forward. She displaced convert 7125 MT LT abbr=on at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of steam turbines powered by ten coal-fired and two oil-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. These provided a top speed of convert 27.5 kn lk=in and a range of convert 4850 nmi lk=in at convert 12 kn abbr=on.Grner, p. 113
The ship was armed with eight 15 cm SK L/45 15&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were arranged in a superfire super-firing pair aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 162 They were supplied with 1,040 rounds of ammunition, for 130 shells per gun. Karlsruhe also carried two convert 8.8 cm abbr=on L/45 anti-aircraft guns mounted on the centerline astern of the funnels. She was also equipped with a pair of convert 60 cm abbr=on torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes in deck-mounted swivel launchers amidships. She also carried 200 naval mine mines. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was convert 60 mm abbr=on thick amidships. The conning tower had convert 100 mm abbr=on thick sides, and the deck was covered with 60&nbsp;mm thick armor plate.
Service history
On 16 August 1917, Karlsruhe participated in a mine-sweeping operation in the North Sea. The minesweepers were clearing Route Yellow, one of the channels in the minefields used by U-boats to leave and return to port. Karlsruhe was joined by the cruiser SMS Frankfurt and three torpedo boats. At 12:55, lookouts on one of the minesweepers spotted a British squadron of three light cruisers and sixteen destroyers approaching.Staff, p. 193 The minesweepers fled south under cover of smoke screens, after which the British broke off the attack. Karlsruhe and the rest of the escort failed to come to their aid, however, and the commander of the operation was subsequently relieved of command.Staff, p. 194
In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Admiralstab Navy High Command planned Operation Albion to seize the Baltic island of Saaremaa sel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Srve Peninsula Sworbe Peninsula.Halpern, p. 213 On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture sel and Muhu Moon Islands; the primary naval component comprised the flagship, the battlecruiser SMS Moltke 1910 2, along with the III and IV&nbsp;Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.Halpern, pp. 214215 Karlsruhe and the rest of the II Scouting Group provided the cruiser screen for the task force.Barrett, p. 127
The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while the IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on sel.Halpern, p. 215 On 18&ndash;19 October, Karlsruhe and the rest of the II Scouting Group covered Minesweeper ship minesweepers operating off the island of Hiiumaa Dag, but due to an insufficient number of minesweepers and bad weather, the operation was postponed.Barrett, p. 218 By 20 October, the islands were under German control and the Russian naval forces had either been destroyed or forced to withdraw. The Admiralstab then ordered the naval component to return to the North Sea.Halpern, p. 219
In October 1918, Karlsruhe and the rest of the II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy. Karlsruhe, SMS Nrnberg 1916 2, and SMS Graudenz  2 were to bombard targets in Flanders while SMS Pillau  2, SMS Cln 1916 2, SMS Dresden 1917 2, and SMS Knigsberg 1915 2 were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary, to draw out the British Grand Fleet.Woodward, p. 116 Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.Tarrant, pp. 280281 On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on SMS Thringen  2 and then on several other battleships Wilhelmshaven mutiny mutinied.Tarrant, pp. 281282 The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.Tarrant, p. 282
Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Karlsruhe was among the ships interned. The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships;Herwig, p. 256 Karlsruhe sank at 15:50. She was never raised for scrapping. The rights to her wreck were sold in 1962.
