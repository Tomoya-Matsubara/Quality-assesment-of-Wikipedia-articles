Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic records, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the Tale of the Red Headed Stranger, a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost in a studio in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added.
A concept album, Red Headed Stranger is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover. The content consists of songs with brief poetic lyrics and arrangements of older material such as Fred Rose's &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, Wolfe Gilbert's &quot;Down Yonder&quot; and Juventino Rosas' &quot;O'er the Waves&quot;. Despite Columbia's doubts and the limited instrumentation, Red Headed Stranger was a blockbuster among country music and mainstream audiences. It was certified multi-platinum, and made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. The title of the album would become a lasting nickname for Nelson. It was ranked #184 on Rolling Stone{{'}}s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number one on CMT's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music. In 2010 it was inducted to the National Recording Registry.
Background and Recording
In 1973 Nelson signed a contract for US$25,000 per year with Atlantic Records, the first country artist signed by the label.1 His first album with Atlantic was the critically acclaimed Shotgun Willie,2 which was followed by Phases and Stages.3 Due to the success of these recordings, Nelson signed with Columbia Records, and was given complete creative control.4
The album is based on the song &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. Nelson often received requests to play the song when he was a DJ in Fort Worth, Texas, where he hosted a show for children. Nelson was inspired to write a complete story that included details of events prior to the ones described in Red Headed Stranger.56 Nelson wrote the songs during his return to Austin, Texas, after a ski trip in Colorado. Nelson spontaneously composed the songs while his then-wife Connie Koepke wrote down the lyrics.7
The recording took place in a studio in Garland, Texas,8 at a cost of US$20,000.9 Nelson featured arrangements of acoustic guitar, accompanied only by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie.10 The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors to doubt the wisdom of releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced and no more than a demo.11 However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.12

The story begins with &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;, where the character evokes his love for his wife, whom he suspects is unfaithful. In the following song, &quot;I Couldn't Believe It Was True&quot;, the infidelity is revealed. This leads to a short version of &quot;Time of the Preacher,&quot; wherein the singer ends with the line &quot;Now the lesson is over, and the killing's begun&quot;. The reaction of the husband is depicted by Nelson in a medley of &quot;Blue Rock, Montana&quot; and &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. The first song describes the double murder of the unfaithful woman and her lover by the Stranger, who states &quot;And they died with a smile on their faces.&quot; This leads to the second song of the medley, which describes the grief of the Stranger.13 This section is followed by Nelson's cover of the 1947 Fred Rose, song &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, were the fugitive laments the loss of his wife. In &quot;Red Headed Stranger,&quot; the protagonist commits a subsequent murder&lt;U+2014&gt;he kills a woman he believes is stealing his horse. The horse, to which he undoubtedly holds a sentimental attachment, had belonged to the Stranger's wife.14
The story continues with the Stranger traveling south. In the song &quot;Denver,&quot; the character falls in love with a woman he meets in a bar in town. One of the lines from &quot;Blue Rock Montana&quot; is repeated, with a variation: &quot;And they danced with a smile on their faces&quot;. The following song, &quot;Can I Sleep in Your Arms?&quot;, shows the desire of the Stranger for redemption and love. Next is &quot;Remember Me&quot;, where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and he is free to love. The story ends with &quot;Hands on the Wheel&quot;, which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child, allegedly his grandson, and his new love. The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song &quot;Bandera&quot;.15
Reception
Chart performance and critical reception
Red Headed Stranger reached number one on the Billboard chart for Top Country Albums,16 and number twenty-eight for forty-three weeks in Top LPs &amp; Tapes.17 On March 11, 1976, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and on November 21, 1986, it was certified double-platinum.18
Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson wrote: &quot;Red Headed Stranger is extraordinarily ambitious, cool, tightly controlled. A phonographic Western movie which brilliantly evokes the mythopoeic imagery of McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Shane and the works of John Ford[...] The narrative may not sound especially promising or unusual&lt;U+2014&gt;like most fables, it is, after all, the same old story: that is its point&lt;U+2014&gt;but in Nelson's hands, its hard-won simplicity calls forth the same complex and profound metaphysical responses as those brought about by the matter-of-fact awesomeness of the Rocky Mountains. Hemingway, who perfected an art of sharp outlines and clipped phrases, used to say that the full power of his composition was accessible only between the lines; and Nelson, on this LP, ties precise, evocative lyrics to not quite remembered, never really forgotten folk melodies to create a similar effect, haunting yet utterly unsentimental. That he did not write much of the material makes his accomplishment no less singular.&quot;19 Meanwhile, critic Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive&lt;U+2014&gt;the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context.&quot;20
Music critic Chet Flippo wrote in a Texas Monthly article entitled &quot;Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album is more than a good country music; it's almost Gospel&quot;: &quot;The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C&amp;W album, and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that strikes me as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing&quot;.21
Billboard described the album as &quot;lots of instrumental work, with particularly fine piano by Bobbie Nelson, and the usual highly stylized Willie Nelson vocals&quot;.22 In 1996 CMJ New Music Monthly wrote: &quot;His Red Headed Stranger was the Sgt. Pepper's of country music, the first record to follow a coherent theme instead of merely compiling radio singles&quot;.23 Allmusic described Red Headed Stranger as &quot;really elusive, as the themes get a little muddled and the tunes themselves are a bit bare. It's undoubtedly distinctive &lt;U+2013&gt; and it sounds more distinctive with each passing year &lt;U+2013&gt; but it's strictly an intellectual triumph and, after a pair of albums that were musically and intellectually sound, it's a bit of a letdown, no matter how successful it was&quot;.24 In 2003 it was included among the top 1,000 albums of Zagat Survey magazine, and was rated five stars out of five. The magazine wrote, &quot;Supporters (of the album) spread the gospel that it's just a quintessential outlaw recording, but perhaps the greatest country album ever with a spare style that changed the way C&amp;W was played&quot;.25
In 2004 it was ranked at number 184 on Rolling Stone{{'}}s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time,26 and number one in CMT's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music in 2006.27 In 2009 it was adopted into the National Recording Registry because Red Headed Stranger is &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or informs or reflects life in the United States.&quot;28
Movie
At an appearance at the Armadillo World Headquarters, a music venue in Austin, Texas, Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. Wittliff. Because of the success of the album, Wittliff decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red Headed Stranger. In 1979 Wittliff finished a draft of the project, which was turned over to Universal Studios. The studio budgeted the film at $14 million and sent the script to Robert Redford, who turned it down. The movie project was tabled, and Wittliff and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal. The script then went to HBO, who assigned the project a budget of $5 million, but this project was not completed either. Finally, Nelson and Wittliff decided to finance the film themselves. Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger, and the movie was released in 1986.29
In popular culture
The first track, &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot;, was used in episodes of the 1985 television drama Edge of Darkness.30 The lyrics to &quot;Time of the Preacher&quot; were used in the opening pages of the first issue of the Vertigo comic book Preacher.31
The complete album was performed and recorded by Carla Bozulich in 2003. The Red Headed Stranger included a guest appearance by Nelson.32 A first season episode of the dramedy series Monk is entitled &quot;Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger,&quot; and guest-stars Willie Nelson.33
