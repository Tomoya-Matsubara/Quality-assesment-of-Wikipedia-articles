is a Japanese politician, who was the Minister of Defense in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but resigned August 27, 2007 after only 54 days in office.1 She is a member of the House of Representatives of Japan for Tokyo's 10th district.
Early life and education
Born and raised in Ashiya, Hyogo, a wealthy Kobe suburb, Koike went to K&lt;U+014D&gt;nan Girls' Junior and Senior High School for her secondary education.
Her father, Y&lt;U+016B&gt;jir&lt;U+014D&gt; Koike, was a foreign trade merchant who handled oil products. He was also involved in politics, supporting Shintar&lt;U+014D&gt; Ishihara and the Tatenokai in 1960s, and ran for a national election to no avail in 1969.2 He occasionally told Yuriko his opinion that it was essential for Japan to strengthen relations with Arab countries in order to ensure a stable petroleum supply lest the resource-poor Japan be thrust into war for oil again. His word encouraged her to decide to study in Egypt to master Arabic.34
After attending the School of Sociology at Kwansei Gakuin University in 1971 and the American University in Cairo in 1972, Koike received a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Cairo University in 1976. She married a Japanese student in Egypt when she was 21 years old, but divorced soon after.56
Career in media
Koike anchored TV Tokyo's World Business Satellite, the nation-wide TV business news program from 1988 to 1992, after co-hosting Kenichi Takemura's  of NTV from 1979 to 1985.
Career in politics
 Koike currently belongs to the Liberal Democratic Party after she belonged to the Japan New Party, New Frontier Party, Liberal Party, and New Conservative Party. She has also served one term in the House of Councillors. She is one of the five Vice Secretaries General of the Diet Members' Committee of , the country's largest conservative think tank, once chaired by Taro Aso.
A past participant in the World Economic Forum, Koike has been considered a prime candidate to become Japan's first female prime minister. Koike is a long-time participant in the U.S.-Japan Legislative Exchange Program hosted by George Washington University and run by Professor Henry Nau.
She previously served as the Minister of the Environment and Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs in the Cabinet of Junichiro Koizumi, Abe's predecessor. She has been responsible for starting the Cool Biz campaign in Japanese political circles.
Originally representing Hy&lt;U+014D&gt;go Prefecture, Koike became one of Koizumi's &quot;assassins&quot; in the 2005 Lower House election, and was critical of LDP members who were defiant of Koizumi's leadership. Her most recent position before becoming Minister of Defense was Special Advisor to the Prime Minister for National Security Issues in the Abe Cabinet.
Koike announced on August 24, 2007 that she intended to resign from the post, citing the Aegis classified information leak scandal as a reason.7 Koike later hinted that the much publicized fight she had had with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki over a vice-minister replacement was the real reason, as the opposition would use that to oppose a bill on Japan's terrorism laws.8
2008 LDP leadership election
On September 8, 2008, Koike launched her bid to become President of the LDP and became the first woman ever to seek the premiership in Japan's history: &quot;I have received the enthusiastic support of my colleagues. In order to break through the deadlock facing Japanese society, I believe the country might as well have a female candidate. Hillary used the word 'glass ceiling' ... but in Japan, it isn't glass, it's an iron plate. I'm not Mrs Thatcher, but what is needed is a strategy that advances a cause with conviction, clear policies and sympathy with the people.&quot;9
In the leadership election, held on September 22, Taro Aso won with 351 of the 527 votes; Koike placed third with 46 votes.10
Political positions
Koike supports for economic liberalism, promotes administrative and budgetary reform, and insists on further advancement of the status of women in the working world. Her motto is &quot;Check, Challenge, Change, Creative and Communication.&quot;11
Having learned ecological lifestyle from her own experience of wartime austerities in Egypt,12 Koike actively addresses environmental issues. She received the Japan Jewelry Best Dresser Award for her success in the Cool Biz and Warm Biz campaign. She expressed the idea of introducing carbon tax in 2005 so that Japan might achieve the goals of the Kyoto Protocol,13 but her idea has not been realized yet. In 2006, she started the &quot;Mottainai Furoshiki&quot; campaign, which urges shoppers to use furoshiki in place of plastic shopping bags.14 She is against the use of biofuels made from food crops.15 Her hope is that Japan will be a society where citizens and companies can make profits by contributing to the protection of the environment, for example through emissions trading.16
As a conservative nationalist, Koike belongs to the Diet members' league to support the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform.1718 She is also a member of the Diet members' group to promote Yasukuni Shrine visits, led by Yoshinobu Shimamura, and goes to worship the war dead at the shrine on War-End Day, August 15, almost every year.19 Not being able to visit it due to an official trip to Okinawa, she sent her proxy to worship at the shrine in 2007.2021 She insists on developing an environment to encourage the emperor to visit Yasukuni.22
Her foreign and security policies are often regarded as hawkish.232425 She suggested that the prime minister revise the interpretation of Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan to enable the government to exercise the right to collective self-defense.2627 She supports the United States' policy in the War on Terror and opposes the Japanese government's tradition of U.N.-centered foreign policy.28 During the 2008 LDP leadership election, she pledged to make Russia return the four disputed islands to Japan if she was elected as prime minister.29
