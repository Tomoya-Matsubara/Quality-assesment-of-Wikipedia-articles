Iris sibirica is a species in the genus Iris, it is also in the subgenus of Limniris'' and series of Iris series Sibiricae. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial.
Iris sibirica is pronounced as EYE-ris sy-BEER-ah-kuh.1
It has the common names of Siberian Iris,2345678 or Siberian Flag (mainly in the UK).910
It is known as iris de Sib&lt;U+00E9&gt;rie (in French), sibirische Schwertlilie or Wiesen-Schwertlilie (in German) and strandiris (in Swedish).11
It has been around before the 1500s and was first called Iris augustifolia media by Carolus Clusius.12 It was first collected in Siberia by monks in the Middle Ages and grown in monasteries, later it was distributed around Europe,where there are now many cultivars.13 It has been cultivated in Britain since 1596.14
It was then first described and published by Carl Linnaeus in his book, Species Plantarum 1 39 on 1 May 1753.1516 Who renamed the iris, Iris sibirica.17
It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service on 20 April 1998.18
The National Collection (of Siberian Irises in UK) is held at Lingen Nursery, on the Welsh border.19
An illustration of iris sibirica has been used as a Postage stamp in Poland.20
Johan Peter Falk noted that the Tara Tartars of Russia (West Siberia) coloured cloth yellow with Iris sibirica flowers and the Votyaks, Mordvins and Kalmyks derived red dye from Galium species.21 In 2014, it was tested for its potential to be used for dying.22
Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.2324 Although an edible starch has been extracted from the plant in China, similar to Iris ensata.25 The root has also been used to create an insecticide and an expectorant.26
An old traditional usage before the wedding night, Polish girls eat the cooked fruit (seeds) of Iris sibirica to help improve contraception.2728
It has also been used to create a drug to be used as an emetic and laxative.29
It has been studied various times.30313233
As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings.34 It has been count various times; 2n=28, Sim. 1928; 2n=28, Skalinska, 1961; 2n=28, Wcislo, 1964; 2n=28 Baerji, 1970; 2n=28, Sharma, 1970; 2n=28; Lovka &amp; Sus. 1971; 2n=28, Pop.&amp; Cesch. 1975,1976; 2n=28, Wetschnig, 1988; 2n=28, Malakhova &amp; Markova, 1994.35 2n=28 is the most common listed count.363738
This means it is similar to Iris sanguinea and Iris typhifolia.39
Cultivation
Generally the 28 chromosome hybrids are easier to grow than the Sino-Siberians.404142
It will tolerate temperatures down to -20 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (-30 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F).43444546 It is hardy to USDA Zone 2-8,474849 and Zone H1 (which means hardy to -20oC and below (-4oF) 50), in Europe.51 It is hardy in the UK.5253 If the plants are mulched in winter they can withstand colder temperatures.54
The iris should be grown in well-drained,5556 fertile,57 neutral to slightly acidic soils (the pH level should be more than 5.6).58596061
If the soil has a high sand or clay content, large amounts of organic material (such as compost or well rotted manure) should be incorporated at planting time.6263
It prefers positions in full sun,6465 but can tolerate part shade (with some hours of sunlight).66676869707172 In very hot, arid regions, they will need some shade, as well as watering and mulching.7374
The plant needs moisture during the growing season (in spring and early summer) to create the best blooms.7576 But they don't grow in the water. Although they will tolerate occasional flooding.7778798081
As Vita Sackville West noted &lt;U+2018&gt;&lt;U+2026&gt;it will do well by the waterside in a fairly damp bed, although it does not like being drowned underwater all year round.&lt;U+2019&gt;82
They can be used in various positions within gardens, at waterside locations beside pools, ponds or streams.8384 Also known as ideal bog garden plants.85868788 They can also be used within a Herbaceous border.8990 The iris can also be used in mixed plantings with grasses and other perennials to create naturalized gardens and meadows.91
They are sturdy plants and do not need to be staked.92
Propagation
 They are best propagated by division.939495 The best time to divide plants is mid-summer to early autumn.96 They do not like root disturbance and should only be divided when the center of the clump dies out.97 When preparing divisions for transplanting, store them in a bucket of water to stop them drying out.98
The new plants are easy to grow but are slow to form flower producing plants, they can take up to 2 years to get big enough to produce flowering stems.99100
The iris can also be grown from seed, allow the mature pods to dry on the plant. Then break open to collect seeds and the direct sow outdoors in fall or autumn.101102
The new plants are planted with the top of the rhizome, 3&lt;U+2013&gt;5 cm 1-2 inches below the soil surface.103 The plant position must be prepared before hand with plenty of compost (or manure) added to the soil to improve the fertility. After planting, the iris must be well watered.104105 Seedlings are also susceptible to transplant shock, this can be lessened if a small plastic pot is placed over the newly planted plant. This protects the plant for the next 3&lt;U+2013&gt;5 days.106 In some regions (especially warm areas), the transplants should be kept moist for the following 6&lt;U+2013&gt;8 weeks.107
In spring, a hand full of fertilizer can be added to the plant to improve flowering or an organic mulch can be added.108109
Description
 Iris sibirica was often confused with Iris sanguinea, another blue flowering Asian iris.110 But sanguinea has unbranched stems, while sibirica has branched stems.111
It has creeping rhizome (approximately  diameter), forming a dense clumping plant.112113114115116 The rhizomes are covered with the brown remnants of old leaves, from previous seasons.117118
It has green grass-like leaves,119120121 which are ribbed and can sometimes have a pink tinge at the base of the leaf.122123 They can grow to between  long and  wide, normally shorter then the flowering stems.124125126127128129 In Autumn, the foliage turns yellow and then dies back (in winter), to re-emerge in the spring.130131132
It has a hollow,133 slender, 1&lt;U+2013&gt;3 branched stem, that grows up to between  long.134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149 The stems bear 2-5 (normally three) flowers, at the terminal ends between late spring and early summer, between May and June.150151152153154155156157158159160161
It has 3 brown paper-like spathes (leaves of the flower bud), that are reddish at the base, measuring between  long.162163164165
The flowers come in a range of blue shades.166 From violet-blue,167168169170171172173174175176177 to blue,178179180181 and occasionally white.182183184185186187188189190 The flowers are  in diameter.191192193194
It has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals, known as the 'standards'.195 The drooping obovate falls, measuring 5-7.5 cm long and 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2.5 cm wide, have a wide (or flaring) white blade or signal (central part of the petal) with dark-blue to violet veining.196197198199200201202 The white forms of the iris have a tinge of lavender and dark veining.203
The smaller narrow upright standards are between 4.5&lt;U+2013&gt;5.5 cm long and 1.5&lt;U+2013&gt;1.8 cm wide.204205206207
It has a light to dark blue-violet, circular perianth tube, about 1 cm long, pale blue style (about 4&lt;U+2013&gt;5 cm long), a pedicel between 1&lt;U+2013&gt;15 cm long and a 1.5&lt;U+2013&gt;2 cm roundly triangular, ovary.208209210
After the iris has flowered, it produces a short stubby seed capsule,211212 which is roundly triangular with low ridges at angles, measuring 3-4.5 cm by 1-1.3 cm.213214215 Inside the capsule, are 2 rows of seeds, which are thin, flat, shaped like a capital D and dark brown seeds, measuring about 5 mm by 3 mm.216217

Status
According to IUCN Red List criteria, it is 'Vulnerable' (VU) (in Czech Republic, Hungary, Ukraine) and it has become 'Extinct' in the Wild (EW) (Slovakia). It is considered to be rare and endangered in Poland and not considered threatened in Romania.272
Hybrids and cultivars
 Since the 1970s, hybridizers and plant breeders have been cross-pollinating the various species in the Siberian group with Iris sibirica to create many hybrids.273274 Whose parentage is now so complicated that the cultivars, are no longer listed with a species name. Several hundred Siberian iris cultivars are registered with the American Iris Society.275 The flowers of the cultivars varying in colour from white to shades of blue or deep violet-blue.276277 Pale blue forms were originally obtained by crossing the white and the blue varieties of Iris sibirica , it also combines readily with Iris sanguinea to produce hybrids with the taller stems.278 The flowers of hybrids can have arched, semi-flaring, flaring or overlapped falls; some of them even have ruffled or extra falls. The newer Japanese hybrids, have six pendant falls, which make them similar in appearance to the Japanese Iris or Iris ensata.279
