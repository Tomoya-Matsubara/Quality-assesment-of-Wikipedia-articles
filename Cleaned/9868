'''Rafael Osuna Herrera ''' (September 15, 1938 – June 4, 1969) is the most successful tennis player in the history of Mexico. He was born in Mexico City, Mexico, and is best remembered for his singles victory at the U.S. Open Championships in 1963 and for leading Mexico to its only Davis Cup Final round appearance. He is the only Mexican to date to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, in 1979.
Career
His first successes as an athlete occurred before he was ten years old, when he competed in the open category of the Mexican National Table Tennis Championships. In the course of the tournament, he upset the Mexico City Table Tennis Champion in singles, a feat remarkable both for Osuna's young age and the fact that it was his first tournament. Osuna also won the Doubles Championship, with Alfredo Ramos Uriarte as his partner. From age 10 to 14 he was ranked in the top 10 in Mexico's Open singles in table tennis.
He was awarded a full scholarship to attend the University of Southern California (USC) in the U.S.A., by Head Coach George Toley, who quickly identified Osuna as a major talent. Osuna participated in the 1960 Wimbledon championships, competing only in the doubles category with Dennis Ralston (soon to be his roommate at school). The two unknown youngsters soon made history, as the first unseeded pair to win the men's doubles at Wimbledon.
This victory marked the beginning of Osuna's career and fame. Described as an &quot;agile and cerebral player&quot;1 who &quot;moves on the tennis court with the grace of a panther&quot; (Tony Mottram), his subsequent achievements include:
He is the only Mexican tennis player ever ranked No. 1 in the world, in 1963, by the International Tennis Federation.2
He is the only Mexican tennis player ever to win a Grand Slam event singles title, The United States Tennis Association National Championships US Open Singles (1963). He is one of only three Latin Americans to win the US Championships, along with Guillermo Vilas and Juan Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n del Potro.
Osuna and Palafox are the only Mexican tennis players ever to win the US Open doubles title, in 1962.
In 1962, as the leader of the Mexican Davis Cup Team, Osuna led the team to its only Davis Cup Final to date, and the first-ever final reached by a Latin American country.
His last victory, two weeks before his death in a plane crash, was an almost single-handed defeat of Australia in Davis Cup competition; Osuna won both his singles matches and the doubles. At that time Australia had won the Davis Cup 17 times, and the defeat was considered a major upset.3
USTA National Hard Courts singles and doubles champion 1962 and doubles champion 1969.
Osuna was NCAA singles champion in 1962, doubles champion from 1961&lt;U+2013&gt;1963, and team champion in 1962-63.4 The 1963 USC tennis team is regarded by some as the best collegiate tennis team of all time.
Osuna won Mexico's only Olympic gold medal in tennis, in men's doubles with Vincent Zaraz&lt;U+00FA&gt;a in 1968.
Osuna earned a Bachelor in Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1963. In that same year, the International Tennis Federation would declare him the year-end No. 1 player in the world.
Style
Osuna was known for his footspeed, touch, and tactical awareness. Commentator Bud Collins dubs him &quot;Mexico's greatest player...Ubiquitous on court, confusing to foes, ever seeking the net&quot;.5 His U.S. Open victory came against big server Frank Froehling, a dangerous unseeded opponent who had upset top-seeded Roy Emerson in the semifinals. Collins describes Osuna's victory as a triumph of tactical play:
Death
Osuna was one of 79 people killed in the crash of Mexicana de Aviaci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Flight 704 on June 4, 1969. He was 30 years old.678
