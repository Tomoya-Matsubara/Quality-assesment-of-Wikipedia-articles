Colonel Charles Perry Stacey (30 July 1906 â€“ 17 November 1989) O.C., O.BE., CD, BA, AM, Ph.D., LL.D., D.Litt, D.Sc Mil, FRSC, was the official historian of the Canadian Army in the Second World War and has been published extensively on matters both military and political. He also published an autobiography entitled A Date With History in which much background information regarding the writing of the Official History of the Canadian Army (and associated volumes such as The Half Million regarding Canadians in Britain and Arms, Men and Government examining the government in Canada) in the Second World War is given. He also sheds light on the poorly managed writing of the Official History of the First World War (only one of the projected eight volumes by the original author ever appeared in print).
Stacey was born in Toronto, Ontario and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in History from the University of Toronto in 1924. He received a second Bachelor's degree in history from Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 1929. In 1933, he received a Ph.D. from Princeton University. From 1933 to 1940, he was a member of the history department at Princeton University.
Stacey joined the Militia before the Second World War; his service as one of the Canadian Army's historians is also well chronicled in his autobiography; he served in the United Kingdom for the majority of the war, collecting and collating information for future historians as well as writing contemporary reports. Stacey's works have contributed much to the study of certain controversial operations such as the Dieppe Raid and Operation Spring. Stacey benefited from his access to the major Canadian military and political figures involved in the War, both during the conflict and afterwards, when the official histories were being finalized for publication.
From 1959 to 1975, he was a Professor of History at the University of Toronto.
He died in Toronto in 1989.
