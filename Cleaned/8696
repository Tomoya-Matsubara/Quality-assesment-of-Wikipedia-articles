Early history
The town was named after Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune.2
Latham
Greeley is located in (or just west of) the area previously occupied by the Overland Trail station of Latham (originally called the Cherokee City Station). The Latham station (also known as Fort Latham) was built in 1862 and named in honor of Milton S. Latham, one of California's early senators. The stagecoach station was at the confluence of the South Platte River and the Cache la Poudre River. The web site www.Over-Land.com describes it as &quot;probably the most important and busiest facility on the Overland Trail&quot; (since it was a river crossing and a junction point for the spur of the Trail south to Denver). It is believed that here occurred the birth of the first white child born in Colorado, a girl. Fort Latham was the headquarters of the government troops during the Indian troubles of 1860-64 and the county seat (the post office being called Latham).
Union Colony
 Greeley began as the Union Colony, which was founded in 1869 as an experimental utopian community &quot;based on temperance, religion, agriculture, education and family values.&quot;3 by Nathan C. Meeker, a newspaper reporter from New York City. Meeker purchased a site at the confluence of the Cache la Poudre and South Platte Rivers (that included the area of Latham, an Overland Trail station), halfway between Cheyenne and Denver along the tracks of the Denver Pacific Railroad formerly known as the &quot;Island Grove Ranch.&quot; The name Union Colony was later changed to Greeley in honor of Horace Greeley, who was Meeker's editor at the New York Tribune, and popularized the phrase &quot;Go West, young man&quot;.4
Geography
Greeley is located at  (40.415119, -104.723988). Elevation above sea level is 4,658 feet.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which  is land and  (0.30%) is water.
Greeley is bordered on the south by the towns of Evans and Garden City, and the three together are often collectively (although incorrectly) referred to as &quot;Greeley&quot;. The Greeley/Evans area is bounded on the south by the South Platte River, and the Cache la Poudre River flows through north Greeley. The intersection of U.S. Highways 85 and 34 is often cited as the location of Greeley, although the actual point of intersection lies within the city limits of Evans. Greeley contains the western terminus of State Highway 257 and borders State Highway 392 on the north.
Climate
Greeley experiences a semi-arid climate (K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen BSk). High temperatures are generally around 90&lt;U+00B0&gt;F-95&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (32&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in the summer and 40&lt;U+00B0&gt;F-45&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (4&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in the winter, although there is significant variation. The hottest days generally occur around the third week of July and the coldest in January. Nighttime lows are near 60&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (16&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in the summer and around 15&lt;U+00B0&gt;F-20&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (-9&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in the winter. Record high temperatures of 106&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (41&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) have been recorded, as have record low temperatures of -25&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (-32&lt;U+00B0&gt;C). The first freeze typically occurs around October 10 and the last can be as late as May 1. Extratropical cyclones which disrupt the weather for the eastern two-thirds of the US often originate in or near Colorado, which means Greeley does not experience many fully developed storm systems. Warm fronts, sleet, and freezing rain are practically non-existent here. In addition, the city's proximity to the Rocky Mountains and lower elevation, compared to the mountains west of the city, result in less precipitation and fewer thunderstorms. This is paradoxical, because adjacent areas (mostly farmland) experience between 7 and 9 hail days per year.5
The climate in Greeley, as well as all of Colorado, is extremely dry. The Chinook winds coming off the mountains often raise temperatures to near 70&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (21&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in January and February, and sometimes to near 90&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (32&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in April. Greeley's elevation and low year-round humidity means that nighttime low temperatures are practically never above 68&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (20&lt;U+00B0&gt;C), even in the very hottest part of the summer. The diurnal temperature range is usually rather wide, with a 50-degree (Fahrenheit) difference between daytime high and nighttime low not uncommon, especially in the spring and fall months. Rapid fluctuation in temperature is also common &lt;U+2013&gt; a sunny 80&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (27&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) October afternoon can easily give way to a 28&lt;U+00B0&gt;F (-2&lt;U+00B0&gt;C) night.
