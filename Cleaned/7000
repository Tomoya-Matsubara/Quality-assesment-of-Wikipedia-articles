U.S. Route 50 US&nbsp;50 is a transcontinental highway in the United States, stretching from Sacramento, California in the west to Ocean City, Maryland on the east coast. The Nevada portion crosses the center of state and was named The Loneliest Road in America by Life magazine Life magazine in July 1986. The name was intended as a pejorative, but instead, Nevada officials seized it as a marketing slogan. The name originates from large desolate areas traversed by the route, with few or no signs of civilization. The highway crosses several large desert valleys separated by numerous mountain ranges towering over the valley floors, in what is known as the Basin and Range provinces of the Great Basin. 
US&nbsp;50 has a diverse route through the state, traversing the resort communities of Lake Tahoe, the state capitol in Carson City, Nevada Carson City, historical sites such as Fort Churchill State Historic Park, petroglyphs, alpine forests, desert valleys, ghost towns and Nevada's only national park, Great Basin National Park.
The route was constructed over a historic corridor, first used for the Pony Express and later for the Central Overland Route and Lincoln Highway. Before the formation of the U.S. Highway System, most of US&nbsp;50 in Nevada was designated State Route 2. The routing east of Ely, Nevada Ely has changed significantly from the original plans. The route change resulted from a rivalry between Nevada and Utah over which transcontinental route was better to serve California bound traffic, the Lincoln Highway or the Victory Highway.

US&nbsp;50 crosses the central portion of Nevada, entering the west side of the state near Lake Tahoe and exiting the east side near Great Basin National Park. The route crosses mostly desolate terrain in the journey across the state; US&nbsp;50 passes through several large desert valleys and Drainage basin basins. The highway crosses 17 named mountain passes that break up the Nevada desert. To crest of some of the passes along US&nbsp;50 requires navigating steep 8% Grade slope grades and hairpin turns through Temperate coniferous forest pine forests to reach altitudes of over convert 7000 ft m sigfig=2.

In 1991, Stephen King drove along US&nbsp;50 as part of a cross country trip. He stopped at Ruth, Nevada Ruth, a ghost town near Ely, Nevada Ely. Studying the abandoned city, King fantasized about the fate of the last residents. King then heard a local legend about how the ghosts of Chinese miners, who died while trapped in a cave-in, can be seen crossing Highway&nbsp;50 to haunt the city of Ruth. King merged these details into his own story, including references to The Loneliest Road in America, which became the novel Desperation.cite book

The Nevada Commission on Tourism sponsors a promotion where visitors can stop at several designated locations along the route and request a state issued novelty passport with a stamp representing that location. Visitors can mail-in the completed passport and receive a certificate, signed by the Governor, certifying they survived The Loneliest Road in America. The word survived is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Life article, which quoted an American Automobile Association spokesperson as saying, We warn all motorists not to drive there unless they're confident of their survival skills.
In the 20 years that have passed since the article was published, US&nbsp;50 has gained popularity among people desiring a scenic or less traveled alternative to Interstate 80 in Nevada Interstate 80 across Nevada. This increase in popularity has caused some to dispute that US&nbsp;50 still deserves the title of The Loneliest Road in America.cite web

US&nbsp;50 enters Nevada from California as a busy four lane thoroughfare on the shores of alpine Lake Tahoe in Stateline, Nevada. The highway follows the eastern shore, squeezing between the lake and the crest of the Carson Range. In one narrow spot the highway cuts through the mountains via the Cave Rock Tunnel. Eventually, the route crests the Carson Range at Spooner Summit and then descends into Nevada's capital, Carson City, Nevada Carson City. Carson Street and William Street currently carry the highway through the city; however, the Nevada Department of Transportation has announced that, upon completion, US&nbsp;50 will be moved to a freeway alignment being constructed for Interstate 580 Nevada Interstate 580.

After Carson City, US&nbsp;50 follows the Carson River towards the Lahontan Valley. This portion is also mostly four lane, serving the commuter towns of Dayton, Nevada Dayton and Silver Springs, Nevada Silver Springs as well as passing by Fort Churchill State Historic Park and Lahontan State Recreation Area. In addition to the trails of the Pony Express and Lincoln Highway, this portion parallels the Carson River branch of the California Trail. The Carson River, and indirectly US&nbsp;50, form the southern edge of the Forty Mile Desert. This desert, located between the termini of the Carson and Humboldt Rivers, was the most dreaded part of the California Trail, where travelers had to endure convert 40 mi km of desert heat with no usable water.cite web

 At the time, the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway system. Utah officials refused to pave the portion of the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. They perceived this route as being expensive to build, with no benefit for the state. Nevada officials, and the Lincoln Highway Association, pleaded with Utah authorities to change their position, even offering funds to help offset the additional cost of paving that route. However, Utah favored the Victory Highway modern Interstate 80 Nevada Interstate 80. The Lincoln highway directed travelers destined for both southern California southern and northern California on a route away from Utah cities, towards central Nevada. The Victory Highway was a shorter, more direct route, that only directed traffic for northern California out of the state.cite web

The modern route of US&nbsp;50 has significantly changed since the highway was first commissioned in 1926. The biggest change is between Ely and Green River, Utah. The first contiguous route of the highway between these cites followed the modified routing of the Lincoln Highway to Salt Lake City. The highway returned to Green River along what is now numbered Utah State Route 201 UT 201, U.S. Route 89 Utah US 89, and U.S. Route 6 Utah US 6. The route was changed when the more direct route between these cities via Delta, Utah was paved. The 1954 edition of the Nevada highway map was the first to show the new routing.
Previously, the road to Delta consisted of unpaved state routes. The paved route did not follow the exact route of the old dirt roads. The improved route bypassed the ghost town of Osceola and entered Utah approximately convert 14 mi km sigfig=2 to the south of the dirt road. The border crossing was moved to facilitate an easier route across western Utah. In Utah, the old road traversed a difficult route through Marjum Canyon, while the paved route followed a simpler path along the north shore of Sevier Lake.cite map

The iteration is now known as Old Clear Creek Road. Only a small portion of Old Clear Creek Road is maintained by the state as unsigned Nevada State Route 705 SR 705, the remainder is an access road for private residences in the canyon. The modern route, also using Clear Creek Canyon, was built in the late 1950s.
