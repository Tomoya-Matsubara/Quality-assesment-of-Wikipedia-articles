Arctoscopus japonicus, the sailfin sandfish or Japanese sandfish, is a species of fish of the Perciformes (Perch-likes) order, Trichodontidae (sandfishes) family. Known in Japan as , it is a commercially important fish especially for Akita and Yamagata prefectures.1 Its habitat occurs in sandy-mud bottoms ranging from the Sea of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea.2
As a food source, the fish has mostly been locally, in the coastal region of the Sea of Japan, and has been designated the official prefectural fish of Akita Prefecture3 The fish, which is scaleless, may be prepared whole as braised or grilled fish, and has a mucilagenous consistency.4 It is also into himono (stockfish), salted, or cured in miso as misozuke. It is also the ingredient of the fish sauce called shottsuru.5 The egg masses are known as burikko.6 In Korean the fish is called  dorumuk.7
The fish had also been used dried or in fish meal form as fertilizer, and shipped to agricultural areas at one time, into the 20th century.
Life cycle and behavior
Its life span is 5 years,8 attaining a typical fork length of 20 cm.9 It is a deep sea fish that usually inhahabits sandy and muddy sea floors in waters of 200 to 400 meters (550 meters10) below surface, but migrate from November to January to spawn in shallow rocky beds of seaweed.11 The male reaches sexual maturity at 1 1/2 year of age and beyond, and females at the 2 year-old stage; they do not die after spawning and run the course of several breeding cycles.12131415
It preys and feeds on amphipods, copepods, mysidacea, krill, squid, and fish.1617
Distribution
It is distributed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, particularly Sea of Japan to the Okhotsk Sea, Kurile Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula.18
Three broad regional population groups had been postulated by Okiyama (1970) based on tagging,19 and later mitochondrial DNA analysis confirmed these grouping on a genetic basis.20 The population groups are:2122
Western Japan (WJ) - Group that migrate the coast of the Sea of Japan from Tottori to Akita Prefecture. Comprised of the &quot;northern Sea of Japan&quot; and &quot;western Sea of Japan&quot; subgroups.2324 The spawning grounds of the group has been assumed to be off all along the coast, but bulk spawning grounds are absent around the Noto Peninsula and any further west/south, and in fact, it has been reported that the western Sea of Japan group's spawning grounds occur in the east coast of the Korean peninsula.25
South Hokkaido (SH) - Group with breeding grounds in the Pacific Ocean off Hokkaido. Consists of , Funka Bay|ja|&lt;U+5674&gt;&lt;U+706B&gt;&lt;U+6E7E&gt;}}, Hidaka, Kushiro, and Nemuro subgroups.26
Eastern Korea (EK) - with breeding grounds in the Eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula.
Catch production in the T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku region (Northeastern Japan)'s Pacific coast (otherwise known as &quot;Sanriku&quot;) is modest, and no regular spawning grounds have been confirmed.27 Migration routes have not be charted, but their travel range is considered extensive, since individuals from the Hokkaido and Sea of Japan population groups have been captured in the Sanriku shore.28
External morphology
The color is silvery underneath, and light brown above with dark brown streaks flecked with spots.29 Tall body depth, though not as high as the Pacific sandfish (Trichodon trichodon).30 Head and trunk are scaleless3132
A large mouth, oblique and turned upwards, is lined with rows of fine teeth.33 The gill-flap on the cheek (preopercle) each has five sharp spines.34 It has a first dorsal and a second dorsal fin that are separated by a gap.35 The pectoral fins are particularly large.36 The air-bladder is absent,37 Active nocturnally, during the day time it lies buried in the mud or sand on the bottom, with only the mouth and eyes (and the spine) showing.3839
The egg mass (roe) is usually green, but may also be yellow, red, or brown. Pigment components bilin and carotenoids such as idoxanthin, crustaxanthin, and vitamin A2 aldehyde (3-dehydroretinal). The bilin and retinal creates the base green color, and the amount of relative idoxanthin content is the determinant of the color variation. Since food sources such as the amphipods and stomach contents reveal negligible traces of idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, they must be converted from the cartenoid astaxanthin that are abundant in their food. Researchers hypothesize that the intake of astaxanthin influences amount of idoxanthin produced and result in egg color changes.40
Classification
In the current taxonomy, the species is classified under the Perciformes (Perch-likes) order, Trachinoidei suborder, and Trichodontidae (sandfishes) family. However, mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the species is more closely related to Cottus spp. of the Scorpaeniformes order.41
Similar species
Pacific sandfish, Trichodon trichodon, or ezo hatahata in Japanese, found from the Aleutian Islands to Alaska down to California.4243
Nomenclature
The Japanese name hatahata may be written as &lt;U+9C30&gt;, which consists of the fish radical &lt;U+9B5A&gt; combined with the character . Shokusanjin (&lt;U+014C&gt;ta Nampo) records the lore that it came to be written this way &quot;because within its scales arises the pattern of Mt. Fuji, and was celebrated as auspicious fish,&quot; though the actual species has no scales.44
An alternate Japanese name is , which come from the fact that its spawning (and catching) season coincides with the months when thunderstorms frequently occur.454647 In fact, hatahata is an old onomatopoeia representing the sound of the thunderclap, whose use is attested in the 10th century Kager&lt;U+014D&gt; Nikki, and which is the root of the verb hatata-ku &quot;to thunder.&quot;4849
In the , hataha sounds like hadahada to non-natives, because the &quot;ta&quot; is locally pronounded in voiced unaspirated dakuon|ja|&lt;U+6FC1&gt;&lt;U+97F3&gt;}}, so that hadahada is sometimes listed as a local name for the fish.50 In Akita, the fish sometimes bears the name &quot;satake uo&quot; after the Satake clan who were rules of the land around 1600. But the Satakes were originally rooted in Hitachi Province (present-day Ibaraki Prefecture), and legend has it that the fish followed the masters from the old country (Shokusanjin notes that the legend is given in the ).5152 In Tottori Prefecture it is called shirohata or kitaha.53
Fisheries
The species is caught by bottom trawling offshore and by  and gillnetting the coastal spawning waters.54 The fish stock down further south are caught by Danish seine fishing.55
In Akita Prefecture, it was bought in bulk by the crates (5 or 10 crates at a time) when in season, and the excess would be preserved as salted fish or as nukazuke to be consumed as a protein source over the winter.5657
FAO Statistics record that in 1950, the annual catch was 10,000 tons accounted solely in Japan, by the beginning of the 1970s Korean fisheries were catching half as much or more in tonnage as the Japanese. The global peak catch occurred in 1971 with 56,700 tons total, but by the end of the decade in 1979 there was a sharp collapse in the fish stock resulting in an annual catch of only 11,546 tons.58
In Akita Prefecture, peak catch attained to 15,000 tons per year,59 but overfishing, possibly with an interplay of water temperature &quot;regime&quot; shifts, led to persisting depletion,60 so that the fishermen of Akita Prefecture, led by its  self-imposed a total moratorium on the catch from 1992-19956162 In 1999, four participating prefectures formed a fisheries management organization to manage the fish stock, followed in 2003 by a formal Resource Recovery Plan (&lt;U+8CC7&gt;&lt;U+6E90&gt;&lt;U+56DE&gt;&lt;U+5FA9&gt;&lt;U+8A08&gt;&lt;U+753B&gt;) for these prefectures.63 In Korea, the catch was 25,000 tons per year in 1971, but suffered a similar decline to 4,000 tons by 2008, and that country has also instituted conservation measures.64
Tottori prefecture is another major catch harvest area. Whereas Akita targets egg-carrying adults approach the surface to spawn, Tottori fishing practices capture the deep water migrating populations by bottom trawling, so that the caught fish tends to be fattier, though without eggs. The catch season for Tottori spans from September to May.6566
Fishing restrictions
In 1999 the Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, and Niigata prefectures instituted restrictions prohibiting capture of fish measuring less than 15 cm.67
Accidents and drownings involving sports fishermen going overboard68 as well as poaching egg masses (scavenging eggs washed ashore also constitute poaching)69 has prompted regulations and patrolling efforts by the fisheries cooperative|ja|&lt;U+6F01&gt;&lt;U+696D&gt;&lt;U+5354&gt;&lt;U+540C&gt;&lt;U+7D44&gt;&lt;U+5408&gt;}} and police.70717273&lt;U+3002&gt;
Foraging, possessing and engagin in sales of egg masses are prohibited (Aomori and Akita)
Fishing method restrictions (Aomori, Akita, Yamagata)
Uses
At one time, dried hatahata was one type of fish-based fertilizer (fish manure) being trafficked in Japan.7475
Food ingredient
The fish lacks scale, has few small bones, and the spine separates easily from the flesh, so that they are usually poached or broiled whole, or just with the head off. If the fish is fresh, snapping the bone at the base of the tail beforehand, will make it easier for the spine to come off easily after broiling. Fresh hatahata can be served salted and broiled, or be poached in a pot flavored with soy sauce, sakekasu, but especially shottsuru in Akita the pot dish would be flavored with shottsuru, a fish sauce traditionally made by fermented the fish cured in brine.76
Another preparation is the dengaku|ja|&lt;U+5473&gt;&lt;U+564C&gt;&lt;U+7530&gt;&lt;U+697D&gt;}} (slathered with sweet miso paste and broiled),77 which is eaten not only in Akita but also in the  around Sakata, Yamagata.
The fish is preserved in various ways, such as nukazuke (pickled in rice bran and salt),78 himono (as dried fish),79 as mirinboshi|ja|&lt;U+307F&gt;&lt;U+308A&gt;&lt;U+3093&gt;&lt;U+5E72&gt;&lt;U+3057&gt;}}, (mirin-based flavored dried fish)  It is also made into a preserved narezushi; in Akita the preserving medium consists of rice and koji (Aspergillus oryzae mold for brewing sake)8081 but in Tottori Prefecture, shirohatazushi|ja|&lt;U+3057&gt;&lt;U+308D&gt;&lt;U+306F&gt;&lt;U+305F&gt;&lt;U+305A&gt;&lt;U+3057&gt;}} and uses okara (soy pulp).8283
Fresh hatahata is suitable for  or poaching in water (the dish in Yamagata is called yu-age84), and eaten with soy sauce. It can be made into hatahata-jiru (miso soup), but the miso should be dissolved in the broth before the fish is plunged, otherwise the fish falls apart.
In South Korea, the fish (known there as dorumuk ()) is eaten in communities in Gangwon Province and elsewhere along the Sea of Japan (which Koreans call &quot;Donghae&quot; or &quot;East Sea&quot;). In Korea it is mainly an ingredient for chige hot pot dishes, but sometimes the roe-laden females are grilled and eaten.85&lt;U+3002&gt;
Shottsuru
200px|thumb|shottsuru
Locally, a fish sauce called shottsuru is made from this fish. The sauce which literally means &quot;salty juice&quot;,86 is made by pickling and fermenting the salted fish, and straining out the debris. The fish sauce is used to flavor the shottsuru nabe, or pot dish that uses this flavoring to cook the hatahata with vegetable and other ingredients.8788 In the Akita dialect, the pot dish also sometimes called shottsuru kayaki, with &quot;&quot; being the local term for nabebono or hot pot dish.
Roe
In the  dialect, the roe of this species is called buriko.89 The fish is caught during its spawning season, when many of the females are loaded with eggs 2–3mm in diameter. The eggs are surrounded by slimy mucous.
Fresh roe that is cooked will burst and make light popping sounds when eaten, but roe from the fish preserved in salt or miso turn rubbery and hard to chew, resulting in a more blunt sound that sounds like buri buri which resulted in its name.
In the miny&lt;U+014D&gt; folk ballad , the Oga de Oga buriko&quot; in the lyrics refers to the roe. {{-}}
