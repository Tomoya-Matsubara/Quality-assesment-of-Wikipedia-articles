R U Professional is a song by the music group The Mae Shi, inspired by the audio of a July 2008 outburst of actor Christian Bale on the set of Terminator Salvation. The song was written and released by the group twenty-four hours after the February 2, 2009 appearance of the Bale outburst on the internet. In a statement released from The Mae Shi, the group explained that the audio from the Bale outburst &quot;was so crazy&quot; that they were inspired to record a song about it, further stating &quot;it's a tribute song we made to celebrate the epic-ness of Christian Bale&quot;. The piece was made available on YouTube and via download on MediaFire on February 3, 2009.
The song has received generally positive reception. MTV.com characterized it as &quot;a Devo-esque slice of new wave fun&quot;, and Dose called it an &quot;electro jam&quot;. Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times called it &quot;a jaunty pop ode to Bale&quot;. Music sites including Pitchfork Media and Prefix Mag were impressed with the group's ability to write, record and release the video within twenty-four hours after the audio of the Bale outburst appeared on the internet.
Background
 While Christian Bale was acting in a scene for the film Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard, Bale yelled at the film's director of photography, Shane Hurlbut, for walking into his line of sight.12 The incident occurred in July 2008 during shooting for the film in New Mexico, and an audio recording of Bale yelling at Hurlbut appeared on the website TMZ.com on February 2, 2009.34 Prior to releasing the audio on the internet, TMZ.com had reported on their website in July 2008.5
During the four-minute audio recording, Bale can be heard screaming obscenities at Hurlbut and threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut did it again and was not fired.67 TMZ.com reported that film executives for Terminator Salvation sent a copy of the audio recording to the film's insurance company, in case Bale did quit the film.89 Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued shooting for seven hours after the incident.101112
In a statement to Los Angeles radio station KROQ on February 6, 2009, Bale said he &quot;acted like a punk&quot;, and that he and Hurlbut talked after the incident and &quot;resolved this completely&quot;.13 Bale acknowledged the two worked together for several hours after the incident, and &quot;at least a month after that&quot;, and noted &quot;I've seen a rough cut of the movie and he has done a wonderful job. It looks fantastic&quot;.14
Inspiration and release
A statement released by The Mae Shi explained the group's inspiration to write the song: &quot;We thought it [the tape] was so crazy that we, The Mae Shi, wrote and recorded a song about it. We should clarify and say that this isn't really a Mae Shi song, it's a tribute song we made to celebrate the epic-ness of Christian Bale.&quot;15 The chorus of the song is &quot;Oh, whoo wow/ He is professional/ But I think he's lost control&quot;,16 and the lyrics: &quot;Swing Kid with a violent streak&quot;,17 &quot;Don't look too deep in his eyes/he can't hide what's inside of his mind/and it might get a little bit ugly/and you might meet an American Psycho&quot;.18 It also incorporates audio clips from Bale's outburst.19 The song was made available for listening on YouTube or via download on MediaFire on February 3, 2009.20

Club called the piece &quot;a hastily written, but pretty amusing, original song&quot;.24 Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media was impressed that &quot;R U Professional&quot; was compiled in twenty-four hours, noting &quot;Props for putting it all together in a day&quot;,25 while Matthew Richardson of Prefix Mag commented &quot;Big congratuatlions to The Mae Shi for turning Christian Bale's huge blow-up on the set of Terminator Salvation into a workable track less than 24 hours after the audio hit the internet.&quot;26
