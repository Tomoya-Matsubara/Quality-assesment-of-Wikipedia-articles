Tyrosol is a phenolic antioxidant present in a variety of natural sources. The principle source in the human diet is olive oil. Tyrosol is a derivative of phenethyl alcohol
As an antioxidant, tyrosol can protect cells against injury due to oxidation.1 Although it is not as potent as other antioxidants present in olive oil, its higher concentration and good bioavailability indicate that it may have an important overall effect.2 This effect may contribute significantly to the health benefits of olive oil and, more generally, the Mediterranean diet.
