The band's members are Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, electronics), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, other instruments), Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar, synthesisers), and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).1 They met while attending Abingdon School, a boys-only public school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.2 The band have released seven studio albums: Pablo Honey (1993), The Bends (1995), OK Computer (1997), Kid A (2000), Amnesiac (2001), Hail to the Thief (2003), and In Rainbows (2007). The first six albums were released by EMI's Parlophone (UK and elsewhere) and Capitol (USA) record labels, and the seventh was released by Radiohead themselves as a digital download, and later by XL Records internationally.3 Several of Radiohead's singles have appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including &quot;Creep&quot; which peaked at number 34, &quot;High and Dry&quot; which peaked at number 78, and &quot;Nude&quot; which peaked at number 37.4
