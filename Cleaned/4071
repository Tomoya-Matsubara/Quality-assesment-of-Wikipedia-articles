Malachi Brendan Martin Ph.D. (July 23, 1921 – July 27, 1999) was a Catholic priest, theologian, writer on the Catholic Church, and professor at the Vatican's Pontifical Biblical Institute. He held three doctorates12 and was the sole author of sixteen books covering religious and geopolitical topics, which were published in eight languages. He wrote additional books under pen names and in collaboration with others. He was a controversial commentator on the Vatican and other matters involving the Church.3 Martin spoke at least ten languages45 including Irish, English, French, Dutch, German, Italian, Russian, Chinese, Hebrew and Modern Arabic, and also knew classical languages like Latin, Classical Greek, Aramaic and Classical Arabic. He lived in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Israel, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, France, and the United States and travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East.6
History
Early life and education
Martin was born prematurely in the village of Ballylongford, County Kerry, Ireland to a middle-class family7 in which the children were raised speaking Irish at the dinner table and Catholic belief and practice were central&lt;U+2014&gt;his three brothers also became priests, two of them academics.8 He received his secondary education at Belvedere College in Dublin, and became a Jesuit novice on September 6, 1939 at the age of eighteen. Due to the Second World War and the inherent risks involved with travel during this time, Martin remained in Ireland and studied at the National University of Ireland where he received a bachelor's degree in Semitic languages and oriental studies while carrying out concurrent study in Assyriology at Trinity College.9
Upon completion of his degree in Dublin, Martin was sent to the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium to continue his education. During the four year stay in Leuven he completed masters degrees in philosophy and theology and got doctorates in Semitic languages, archeology and Oriental history. On August 15, 1954, the Feast of the Assumption, Martin was ordained a Jesuit priest at the age of thirty-three.10
Martin started postgraduate studies at both the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and at Oxford University, specializing in intertestamentary studies and knowledge of Jesus Christ and of Hebrew and Arabic manuscripts. He undertook additional study in rational psychology, experimental psychology, physics and anthropology.11
Work and ordination
Martin says he took part in the research of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and published twenty four articles on Semitic paleography in various journals.1213 He did archeological research and worked extensively on the Byblos syllabary in Byblos,14 in Tyre,15 both in Lebanon, and in the Sinai Peninsula. Martin assisted in his first exorcism while staying in Egypt for archeological research. It was upon a Muslim.16 He published a work in two volumes, The Scribal Character of the Dead Sea Scrolls, in 1958.17
Martin travelled publicly and clandestinely to Eastern Europe and Soviet Russia during and after the reign of Pius XII. He said he carried out sacramental missions and was active in intelligence gathering for the church.18
He was summoned to Rome to work at the Holy See as a private secretary for Cardinal Augustin Bea S.J. from 1958 until 1964. This brought him into contact with Pope John XXIII. His years in Rome coincided with the start of the Second Vatican Council (1962&lt;U+2013&gt;65), all of which sessions he attended19 and which was to transform the Catholic Church in a way that the initially-liberal Martin began to find distressing.20 He became friends with Msgr. George Higgins and Fr. John Courtney Murray S.J.21
While in Rome, he became a professor at the Pontifical Biblical Institute of the Vatican, where he taught Aramaic, paleography, Hebrew and Sacred Scripture.22 He during that time also taught theology, part-time, at Loyola University of Chicago's John Felice Rome Center.23 During that period his living quarters were in the Vatican, outside the papal quarters of John XXIII.24 He worked for the Orthodox Churches and ancient Oriental Churches division of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity under Cardinal Bea, as a translator. As a result of this, Martin became well acquainted with prominent Jewish leaders, such as Rabbi Abraham Heschel, during 1961 and 1962.25 Martin also accompanied Paul VI in his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in January 1964.26 Martin resigned his position at the Pontifical Institute in June 1964.27
Disillusioned by the reforms taking place among the Jesuits, the Church's largest religious order, Martin requested special dispensation in February 1965.28 He received a provisional release in May 196529 and a definite release from his vows of poverty and obedience on June 30, 1965,30 after 25 years as a Jesuit religious, and left Rome suddenly in July.31 He was not released from his vow of chastity and remained an ordained but secular priest. Paul VI gave him a general commission for exercising an apostolate in the media and communications.32
After a stay of eight months in Paris,33 where he worked as a translator, Martin went to Ireland where he stayed with family.34 During his stay in Ireland he was falsely rumored to have a mental breakdown by local Jesuits.35 He moved permanently to New York City in 1966, where he first had to work as a dishwasher, a waiter and taxi driver36 before being able to make his living by writing.37 He co-founded an antiques firm and was active in communications and media for the rest of his life.38 The campaign of rumors of a problematic history concerning his mental health and moral behaviour was continued by American Jesuits.39
After his arrival in New York, Cardinal Terence Cooke gave him written permission to exercise his secular priestly faculties. The Cardinal advised him to find lodging with a family rather than live alone as he initially did. He moved to the Upper East Side Manhattan home of Kakia Livanos and her family. She was his landlady and provided his rooms, his meals, and the oratory where he said daily Mass.
Communications and media
In 1964, Martin, under the pseudonym Michael Serafian, wrote The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, The Council and The Church in a time of decision, an apologia for the Jews, which, among other things, told the story of the Jewish question and the Second Vatican Council.
In 1967, Martin received his first Guggenheim fellowship.40 In 1969 he got his first breakthrough with his book The Encounter: Religion in Crisis as a result of his expertise in Judaism, Christianity and Islam and with which he won the Choice Book Award of the American Library Association.41 Afterwards came other liberally oriented books like Three Popes and the Cardinal: The Church of Pius, John and Paul in its Encounter with Human History (1972) and Jesus Now: How Jesus has no Past, Will not come Again and in loving actions is Dissolving the Molds of Our Spent Society (1973). Martin became an American citizen in 1970.
He received a second Guggenheim fellowship in 1969, which enabled him to write his first of four bestsellers,42 Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Living Americans. With this book, published in 1975, Martin references his experience as an exorcist. According to the book he assisted in several exorcisms. In 1996, he spoke of having performed thousands of minor exorcisms, and participated43 in a few hundred major exorcisms during his lifetime.44
Psychiatrist Morgan Scott Peck, author of The Road Less Traveled, developed a friendship with Martin and was influenced by the latter in the development of his theories of evil and exorcism.45
During that decade, Martin also served as religion editor for National Review464748 from 1972 to 1978, when he was succeeded by Michael Novak. He was interviewed twice by William F. Buckley, Jr. for Firing Line on PBS.49 He also was an editor for the Encyclop&lt;U+00E6&gt;dia Britannica.50 His literary agent was Lila Karpf.51
Martin published several books in quick succession the following years: The Final Conclave (1978), King of Kings: a Novel of the Life of David (1980) and Vatican: A Novel (1986) were factional novels. The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church (1981), The New Castle: Reaching for the Ultimate (1982), Rich Church, Poor Church: The Catholic Church and its Money (1984) and There is Still Love: Five Parables of God's Love That Will Change Your Life (1984) were non-fiction works.
His bestselling52 1987 non-fiction book The Jesuits: The Society of Jesus and the Betrayal of the Roman Catholic Church was very critical of his previous ecclesiastical order. The book accused them of systematically undermining church teachings and replacing them with communist doctrines.53
Later life
His book The Keys of This Blood: The Struggle for World Dominion between Pope John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Capitalist West was published in 1990 and was followed in 1996 by Windswept House: A Vatican Novel. Martin worked closely with the paranormal researchers Dave Considine and John Zaffis on several of their independent cases.
Martin continued to daily offer the traditional Latin mass privately, and vigorously exercised his priestly ministry all the way up until his death. He was strongly supported by some traditional Catholics sources and severely criticized by other sources, such as the National Catholic Reporter.545556
Martin served as a guest commentator for CNN during the live coverage of the pastoral visit of John Paul II to the United States October 4&lt;U+2013&gt;8, 1995.
He was a periodic guest on Art Bell's radio program, Coast to Coast AM, between 1995 and 1998 and a guest of Michael Corbin's radio program on Paranet Continuum radio.
In the last three years of his life, Martin had forged a close friendship with the traditional Catholic philosopher, Fr. Rama Coomaraswamy.57
In the final years before his death, Martin was received in a private audience by pope John Paul II.58 Afterwards, he started working on a book with the working title Primacy: How the Institutional Roman Catholic Church became a Creature of the New World Order.59 This book which promised to be his most controversial and detailed work ever was never completed.
Martin suffered a minor stroke in the summer of 1998.
Death
 Martin died of brain hemorrhage after a fall in his apartment in Manhattan, New York, in 1999. He was hospitalized, received the traditional sacrament of extreme unction, and a few days later pronounced dead at Lenox Hill Hospital.60 His funeral wake took place in St. Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Chapel of West Orange, New Jersey. Requiem Mass for his repose was offered by the late Father Paul A. Wickens (April 14, 1930 – July 8, 2004) before the burial within the Gate of Heaven Cemetery, in Hawthorne, New York.
Family
The Martin family had the following children.61 Malachi Martin had 3 religious brothers: Rev. Prof. Francis Xavier Martin O.S.A., Rev. William (Liam) Martin and Rev. Prof. Conor Martin.62 Martin had four sisters, Marie Therese (Maura) Ferntren, Kathleen (Kay) Doyle, Etnia (Netta) Kelly and Joan (Josette) O'Dowd, who survived him. Another brother, James (Jim) Martin, who died very young.63
Fr. Liam Martin, his brother, was private secretary to John Charles McQuaid C.S.Sp., Archbishop of Dublin.64
Writings
Martin produced numerous best-selling fictional and non-fictional literary works, which became widely read throughout the world. His fictional works gave detailed insider accounts of Church history during the reigns of Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI (The Pilgrim, Three Popes and the Cardinal, Vatican: A Novel65), John Paul I (The Final Conclave66) and John Paul II (The Keys of This Blood, Windswept House).
His non-fictional writings cover a range of Catholic topics, such as demonic exorcisms (Hostage to the Devil), satanism, Liberation Theology, the Second Vatican Council (The Pilgrim), the Tridentine liturgy, Catholic dogma, modernism (Three Popes and the Cardinal; The Jesuits), the financial history of the Church (Rich Church, Poor Church; The Decline and Fall of the Roman Church), the New World Order and the geopolitical importance of the Pope (The Keys of This Blood).
His books, both fictional and non-fictional, frequently present a dark view of the present state of the world, invoking dark spirits, conspiracy, betrayal, heresy, widespread sexual perversion, self-advancement, and demonic possession, each being asserted as rife throughout the Catholic Church, from its lowest levels up to its highest.
Opinions
Supporters of Fr. Nicholas Gruner said Martin was privileged to secret information pertaining to Vatican and other world issues,67 which included the apparitions of Our Lady in Fatima.68 He spoke and wrote often about the three secrets of Fatima and was an ardent supporter of Gruner in this: &quot;Father Gruner is fulfilling a desperately needed function in the ongoing perception of Mary's role in the salvation of our imperilled world. Father Gruner is absolutely correct that the consecration of Russia as&lt;U+2014&gt;Our Lady desired, has not been executed&quot;.69
Martin said concerning the three secrets of the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven in Fatima in 1917, she mandated the pope of 1960 to consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart. The Russian orthodox church would then convert back. If the mandate were not followed, devastating war in the world and destruction inside the church (The Great Apostasy) would follow. He said that he stood outside the papal living quarters in 1960 whilst Pope John XXIII and Cardinal Bea and others were reading the document containing the third secret, and that, in order to assure Russian cooperation at the approaching Second Vatican Council, the Pope decided against the mandate. Later Paul VI and John Paul II also decided against it for various reasons.70
He was an outspoken opponent of the alleged apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Bayside in the United States71 and Me&lt;U+0111&gt;ugorje in former Yugoslavia.72 Martin regretted writing the foreword of The Thunder of Justice: The Warning, the Miracle, the Chastisement, the Era of Peace, a 1993 book by Ted and Maureen Flynn73 defending, among others, the apparitions in Me&lt;U+0111&gt;ugorje, stating that false pretences were used in obtaining his recommendation.74 Concerning the Garabandal apparitions, he remained open-minded.75
Martin believed the multiple ordinations of sedevacantist bishops by the former Archbishop of Hu&lt;U+1EBF&gt;, Vietnam, Pierre Martin Ng&lt;U+00F4&gt; &lt;U+0110&gt;&lt;U+00EC&gt;nh Th&lt;U+1EE5&gt;c, although not allowed, were sacramentally valid.76
In March 1997 Martin said on Radio Liberty's Steel on Steel, hosted by John Loefller, that two popes were murdered during the Twentieth century:
Pope Pius XI was murdered on the orders of Benito Mussolini, because of his 1931 encyclical, Non Abbiamo Bisogno, which was critical of the Italian fascist state.
Pope John Paul I was murdered7778 according to Malachi's book, Vatican: A Novel, by the Cardinal Secretary of State under Pope Paul VI, Jean-Marie Villot, under orders from the U.S.S.R..79
Martin also partially gave credence to the Siri Thesis, saying that Cardinal Giuseppe Siri was twice elected pope in papal conclaves, but declined his election after being pressured by worldly forces acting through cardinals present at the conclaves. Martin called this the little brutality. On the one hand, Martin says that Siri was intimidated: on the other hand he says that Siri did indicate that his decision not to accept was made freely.8081
The first occasion, according to him, was the Papal conclave, 1963. Martin mentions the possibility of a nuclear threat which involved &quot;the very existence of the Vatican state&quot; during this conclave on pages 600 to 610 of his book The Keys of this Blood, which deals primarily with Siri and the 1963 conclave.
The second time was the Papal conclave, October 1978. Martin said on Radio Liberty's programme Steel on Steel, hosted by John Loefller, in March 1997 that Siri received a written note after his initial election threatening him and his family with death should he accept.82
Martin, who spoke many languages, was present at both conclaves as a translator.
Martin claimed that Popes John XXIII and Paul VI were freemasons during a certain period and that photographs and other detailed documents proving this were in the possession of the Vatican State Secretariat.83 He also allegorically mentioned these supposed facts in his 1986 novel Vatican: A Novel, where he related the masonic adherence of popes Giovanni Angelica and Giovanni De Brescia.84 He also said that Archbishop Annibale Bugnini C.M. was a freemason and that Agostino Casaroli, long time Cardinal Secretary of State, was an atheist.85
In his book The Jesuits, published in 1987, Martin claims to prove the existence of a diplomatic agreement between the Vatican and the U.S.S.R. called the Metz Accord. The Vatican allegedly promised a non condemnation of communism in exchange for participation of Russian-Orthodox prelates as observers at the Second Vatican Council.
In his book The Final Conclave, published on 1 August 1978,86 the month of the 1978 conclave that resulted in the 28 August election of Albino Luciani, Malachi Martin wrote of the unexpected election of a Cardinal Angelico, a figure that has been interpreted as corresponding to Luciani.87
Martin stated that, along with diabolic possession, angelic possession also exists and that angels could have use of preternatural powers in certain circumstances.8889
Martin was convinced that the antichrist described in the Book of Revelation was a literal historical figure, and was alive in 1996.90
Controversies
Alleged affairs
There were two allegations made against Martin of having an affair with a woman:
Malachi Martin was criticized most notably in the book Clerical Error: A True Story by Robert Blair Kaiser, Time Magazine's former Vatican correspondent. Kaiser, a former Jesuit, accused Martin of having carried on an extramarital affair with his wife during 1964 in Rome,91 and claimed that Martin fled to the United States as a renegade from the priesthood. Throughout the book, Martin is presented as a liar and fantasist.92 A friend of Martin's, William H. Kennedy, published an article in the journal Seattle Catholic to dispute Kaiser's allegation and other claims made about Martin after his death.93 Kennedy points out that Kaiser admits in his book that he was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia,94 and cites passages from Kaiser's book which he believes show that Kaiser was writing from a distorted and delusional perspective due to his mental illness. With regard to being a renegade from the priesthood, evidence is cited that suggests that Martin received a special dispensation in order to become a writer, while retaining his status as a priest with limited faculties.9596
In her 2008 book Queen of the Oil Club: The Intrepid Wanda Jablonski and the Power of Information, Anna Rubino wrote that Martin had a love affair with oil journalist Wanda Jablonski on a visit to Beirut, Lebanon in the 1950s.97 The book was published long after the deaths of both Jablonski (1992) and Martin (1999).
Laicization dispute
In 2004, Father Vincent O'Keefe S.J., former Vicar General of the Society of Jesus and a past President of Fordham University, stated that Martin had never been laicized. O'Keefe stated that Martin had been released as a religious from all his vows&lt;U+2014&gt;poverty and obedience&lt;U+2014&gt;save the vow of chastity.98 Martin no longer was a Jesuit but remained a (secular) priest during the rest of his life.
The Vatican, on the other hand, has a different view. In a letter the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life states:
&quot;In 1965, Mr. Martin received a dispensation from all privileges and obligations deriving from his vows as a Jesuit and from priestly ordination.&quot; [Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, 25 June 1997, Prot. N. 04300/65].99
According to the Vatican Martin was not only released from religious vows but also his vows from &quot;priestly ordination&quot; (which means laicisation).100
It is claimed that attacks were mounted on Martin in retaliation for his book The Jesuits, which is hostile to the Jesuit order of which he had formerly been a member.101 In the book, he accuses the Jesuits of deviating from their original character and mission by embracing Liberation Theology.102
Ordination dispute
During a videotaped memorial entitled Malachi Martin Weeps For His Church, Rama Coomaraswamy, a sedevacantist clergyman, claimed that Martin had told him that he had been secretly ordained a bishop during the reign of Pius XII in order to travel behind the Iron Curtain ordaining priests and bishops for the underground churches of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Coomaraswamy died in 2006.103104105106
Alleged authorship
The book The Pilgrim: Pope Paul VI, The Council and The Church in a time of decision was written by Martin under the pseudonym Michael Serafian. This was confirmed by Martin himself and corroborated independently by Prof. Dr. Hans K&lt;U+00FC&gt;ng.107 Martin related that his choice of surname, Serafian, is due to meeting a carpet dealer in Jerusalem with that name, during the pilgrimage of Paul VI to the Holy Land in January 1964.108
The anonymously written book Complaints against God by One of His Creatures was not written by Martin but by Fr. Andrew Greeley, a liberal priest.109
The pseudonym of Xavier Rynne, used to write more than 20 books on Vatican II, is not that of Martin but of Fr. Francis X. Murphy C.s.s.R..110111
The 1966 article Laures et ermitages du d&lt;U+00E9&gt;sert d'Egypte published in M&lt;U+00E9&gt;langes de l'Universit&lt;U+00E9&gt; Saint-Joseph by the hand of M. Martin was written by Maurice Martin, and not Malachi Martin.112
Alleged service of Jewish interests
Journalist Joseph Roddy alleged&lt;U+2014&gt;in a 1966 Look Magazine article about the debate on the Jewish question during the Second Vatican Council113&lt;U+2014&gt;that one and the same person under three different pseudonyms had written or acted on behalf of Jewish interest groups, such as the American Jewish Committee, to influence the outcome of the debates. Roddy wrote that two timely and remunerated 1965 articles were penned under the pseudonym of F.E. Cartus, one for Harper's Magazine114 and one for the American Jewish Committee&lt;U+2019&gt;s influential intellectual periodical Commentary Magazine.115116 Roddy further stated that tidbits of information were leaked to the New York press that detailed Council failings vis a vis the Jews under the pseudonym of Pushkin. Roddy also stated that these two unidentified persons were one and the same person&lt;U+2014&gt;a young cleric-turned-journalist and a Jesuit of Irish descent working for Cardinal Bea and who was active in the Biblical Institute&lt;U+2014&gt;he figuratively named as Timothy O'Boyle-Fitzharris S.J. in order not to reveal the true identity of his source. Roddy also mentions The Pilgrim in a footnote to his article.
In his 2007 book Spiritual Radical: Abraham Joshua Heschel in America, Edward K. Kaplan confirmed that Martin cooperated with the American Jewish Committee during the Council for a mixture of motives, both lofty and ignoble. He primarily advised the committee on theological issues, but he also provided logistical intelligence and copies of restricted documents. It is confirmed in the book that Martin used the pseudonyms Forest and Pushkin.117 Kaplan further acknowledges that the kiss and tell book about the internal workings of the Council, The Pilgrim by Michael Serafian, was requested from Martin by Abraham J. Heschel, who also arranged the book to be published by Roger W. Straus, Jr.'s Farrar, Straus and Giroux printing company. It was published in the hope that it would influence the deliberations in the council.118 Once that Martin's identity as author was revealed, it led to protests and the book had to be removed from circulation at considerable financial loss to the publisher. This led to the end of friendly relations between Martin and Heschel and Straus.119 Kaplan lastly states that Malachi Martin was the primary source of information for Joseph Roddy in writing his 1966 article for Look Magazine, and that Fr. Timothy O'Boyle-Fitzharris S.J. was in fact Martin. Kaplan judges the Roddy article as dangerously misleading because of the credence it gives to the claim that without organised Jewish pressure the council declaration on the Jews would not have been accepted.120
Martin explicitly denied he was a spy, along with denying other rumors. Michael Cuneo, in his book American Exorcism writes that, &quot;Martin told me that he was perplexed, and more than a little annoyed, by the swirl of rumors surrounding his personal life.&quot; He quotes Martin as saying:
''Look, I've had three heart operations, recently open-heart surgery, and I'm at the point where I'd like to put some of these stories to rest,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been accused of everything; speculation on my life is a veritable cottage industry. I'm a lecher, a wife-stealer, and a spy; I'm secretly married with children; I've sexually abused little girls— it's all nothing but fancy.''121
Alleged Jewish heritage
Rumors appearing on various Catholic or sedevacantist websites122 and magazines123 alleged that Malachi Martin had Jewish ancestry on account of ancestral descent from Iberian Jews migrating to Ireland and Great Britain in the 15th century, and alleged him being an Israeli spy124 because of his first name, Malachi, after a Hebrew prophet and his extensive travels in the Levant. These allegations were rebutted by William H. Kennedy in his article In Defense of Father Malachi Martin.125 After having made genealogical inquiries with surviving relatives of Martin in Ireland, Kennedy concluded that Martin's father was an Englishman who moved to Ireland and his mother was fully Irish. Fr. Rama Coomasrawamy confirmed this independently.126 The Irish language name Maelsechlainn is usually anglicised as Malachy.
Alleged photograph
Claims that Martin features as a curial monsignor in full regalia on a prominent 1979 photograph next to Pope John Paul I and his assistant Diego Lorenzi appeared on the Internet.127 The photograph, published in David Yallop's In God's Name: An Investigation into the Murder of Pope John Paul I as number 28 between pages 120 and 121, shows a 'Monsignor Martin', visibly different from Malachi Martin.128 This is a case of mistaken identity. The cleric in the photograph was Jacques-Paul Martin, Prefect of the Casa Pontificia between 1969&lt;U+2013&gt;86.129130
