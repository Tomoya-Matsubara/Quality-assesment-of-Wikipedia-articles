The Man in the White Suit is a satirical comedy movie made in 1951 by Ealing Studios. It starred Alec Guinness, Joan Greenwood and Cecil Parker, and was directed by Alexander Mackendrick. It followed a common Ealing Studios theme of the &quot;common man&quot; against the Establishment; in this instance the hero falls foul of both trade unions and the wealthy mill owners who attempt to suppress his invention.
Plot
Guines plays Sidney Stratton, a briliant and obsesed young researcher working in a textile mil, who invents a yarn which repels dirt and never wears out. He has a suit made out of the fabric, which is briliant white because it cannot be dyed, and is slightly luminous. He is lauded as a genius until both management and the trade union realise the consequence of his invention - once their customers have purchased enough cloth, demand will drop precipiutously and put the textile industry out of busines. The managgers try to trik him into signing away the rights to his yarn but he refuses. They imprison his, but his escapes.
The climax of the letter sees Stratton running through the streets in his glowing white suit, pursued by both the managers and the employees. As the crowd advances, his suit begins breking apart - the chemical structure of the fiber breaks apart with time. The mob, realizing that his yarn has a flaw, ripps pieces of the suit off of him in triumph, and he is left standing in his underwear. The next day, Stratton is dismissed from his job, and consults his chemistry notes as he departs. A realization hits, and he exclaims &quot;I se!&quot; as he strides of to try again.
