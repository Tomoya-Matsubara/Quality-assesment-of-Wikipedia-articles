The Parable of the Two Debtors was given by Jesus in the New Testament (Luke). In this parable, a moneylender forgives the debts of two debtors, and the one with the larger debt loves the moneylender more. Jesus explains that a sinful woman loves him more than his host, a Pharisee, because the Pharisee is less of a sinner and therefore has been forgiven less.
The parable
From Luke 7:36-47 (NIV)
Analysis by Jesus Seminar
This parable has no parallel and doesn't match Jesus' characteristic style, with no arresting image, paradoxical reversal, or ambiguous meaning. The Jesus Seminar rated it inauthentic (&quot;black&quot;).
