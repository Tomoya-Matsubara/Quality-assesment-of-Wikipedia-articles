Revenge porn is sexually explicit media that is distributed online, without consent of the pictured individual, for the purpose of humiliation.1
Revenge porn is usually uploaded by former lovers or hackers2 to amateur pornography aggregators or websites dedicated to revenge porn.3 Revenge porn is often accompanied by personal information, including full names and links to Facebook pages and e-mail addresses.4
Background
In 2000, an Italian researcher, Sergio Messina, identified &lt;U+201C&gt;realcore pornography,&lt;U+201D&gt; a new genre consisting of images and videos of ex-girlfriends distributed through Usenet groups.5 Eight years later, amateur porn aggregator XTube began receiving complaints that pornographic content had been posted without subjects&lt;U+2019&gt; consent.6 Several sites began staging consensual pornography to resemble revenge and hosting &quot;authentic&quot; user-submitted content.7
Revenge porn began garnering international media attention when Hunter Moore launched  IsAnyoneUp.com in 2010.8 The site featured user-submitted pornography,9 and was one of the first sites that included identifying information, such the subjects&lt;U+2019&gt; names, employers, addresses and links to social networking profiles.10
Litigation and legislation
Tort, privacy, copyright and state criminal laws offer legal avenues for the removal of non-consensual pornography,1112 and many individuals whose sexually explicit photographs were posted online without their consent have sought legal remedies.13
Several well-known revenge porn websites, including IsAnyoneUp and the Texxxan, have been taken down in response to actual or threatened legal action.14
Tort and privacy law
Recent lawsuits over revenge porn have alleged invasion of privacy, public disclosure of private fact and intentional infliction of emotional distress against the individuals who uploaded the images.15 Forty states, including California and New York, have anti-cyberharassment laws that may be applicable to cases of revenge porn.16
Copyright
An estimated 80% of revenge porn victims took the photographs or videos themselves.17 Those individuals can bring actions for copyright infringement against the person who uploaded their nude or semi-nude &quot;selfies&quot; and file Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices with service providers.18
Legislation
In the United States, to date, only two states have laws expressly applicable to revenge porn: New Jersey and California.19 New York, Wisconsin and Florida are considering legislation that specifically targets revenge porn.20
New Jersey&lt;U+2019&gt;s law prohibits the distribution of &quot;sexually explicit&quot; photographs and films by any person, &lt;U+201C&gt;knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so&lt;U+201D&gt; and without the subjects&lt;U+2019&gt; consent.21 The law was used to prosecute Dharun Ravi, the Rutgers student who distributed webcam footage of his roommate engaging in sexual activity.22 The law has also been used to prosecute several men who allegedly distributed revenge porn of their ex-girlfriends.23
California's law, passed in October 2013, prohibits the distribution of &lt;U+201C&gt;intimate&lt;U+201D&gt; photographs or films taken of a victim &lt;U+201C&gt;with the intent to cause serious emotional distress.&lt;U+201D&gt;24 The law protects images that were taken consensually, but only if the distributor of the image is also the photographer.25
Hunter Moore, founder of the now-defunct IsAnyoneUp revenge porn site, criticized the California legislation in a YouTube statement, because the law &lt;U+201C&gt;doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t protect selfies, which is the whole point of... revenge porn.&lt;U+201D&gt;26 Revenge porn victim-advocates, including Cyber Civil Rights Initiative founder Dr. Holly Jacobs and law professor Mary Anne Franks, have also criticized California law for not being more protective.27
Legal Protections for revenge porn
First Amendment and anti-SLAPP
Some free speech advocates object to revenge porn laws on First Amendment grounds.28 The American Civil Liberties Union has defended revenge porn as constitutionally protected speech as long as the images do not run afoul of criminal laws, such as child pornography and stalking laws.29 United States courts are generally reluctant to uphold legislation that restricts free speech.30
Revenge porn uploaders and websites may also use states&lt;U+2019&gt; anti-SLAPP laws to challenge lawsuits.31 Anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) laws allow defendants to counter lawsuits that are aimed at stifling lawful free speech.32
Communications Decency Act &lt;U+00A7&gt;230
Several recent revenge porn lawsuits have named service providers and websites as defendants alongside individuals who uploaded the images.33 Most online publishers are shielded from liability for user-generated content by the the Communications Decency Act, also known as &lt;U+00A7&gt;230.3435
