Alejandro Plaz Castillo is a founder of the Venezuelan volunteer civil association, S&lt;U+00FA&gt;mate.
Plaz is a Venezuelan engineer and management consultant, who holds three Master&lt;U+2019&gt;s degrees (two from Stanford University), and was a Senior partner for McKinsey &amp; Company in Latin America, before taking a leave of absence to co-found S&lt;U+00FA&gt;mate with Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a Corina Machado.
Plaz and other members of S&lt;U+00FA&gt;mate were charged with treason and conspiracy for receiving a $31,000 grant from the National Endowment for Democracy which, according to the United States Department of State, was &quot;aimed at strengthening citizen participation in the democratic, constitutional processes of their country&quot;.1 The trial was suspended in February 2006 because of due process violations by the trial judge, and has been postponed several times.2
