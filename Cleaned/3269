The History of Mumbai recounts the growth of Mumbai from a collection of seven islands on the western coast of India becoming the commercial capital of the nation and one of the most populous cities in the world. Although human habitation existed during the Stone Age, the Kolis were the earliest settlers of the islands. The Maurya Empire gained control of the islands during the third century BCE, and transformed it into a centre for Hindu and Buddhist culture and religion. The Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas ruled the islands later, before it fell to the Silhara dynasty from 810 to 1260.
King Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century, and brought many settlers to the islands. The Muzaffarid dynasty of Gujarat captured the islands in 1343 ending the Hindu sovereignty over the islands. The Treaty of Bassein between the Portuguese and Sultan Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate placed the islands into Portuguese possession in 1534. Charles II of England received possession of the islands in 1661 as the dowry of Catherine de Braganza, and he later leased them to the British East India Company in 1668. The city was named Bombay by the British.
The islands suffered incursions from Mughals towards the end of the 17th century. During the mid-18th century, the city emerged as an important trading town, with maritime trade contacts with Mecca and Basra. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century with the first-ever Indian railway line beginning operations between Bombay and neighbouring Thane in 1853. The city became a strong base of the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century and was the main centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha of 1919 and Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946.
In 1960, following protests from the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, the city was &quot;transferred&quot; from the State of Bombay and incorporated into the dominion of the newly created Maharashtra State. The city's secular fabric was torn apart in the communal riots of 1992&lt;U+2013&gt;93, while the bombings of 1993 caused extensive loss of life and property. The name of the city was changed from Bombay to Mumbai in 1996. The city suffered several terrorist attacks during the 21st century.
Ancient period (200 BCE - 1348 CE)
 Geologists believe that coast of western India came into being around 100 to 80 mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the R&lt;U+00E9&gt;union hotspot, a volcanic hotspot in the earth's lithosphere near the island of R&lt;U+00E9&gt;union. An eruption here some 65 mya is thought to have laid down the Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region led to the formation of hilly islands separated by a shallow sea.1 Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Bombay by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 posit the theory that these islands were inhabited since the Stone Age.2 The islands were incorporated into the Maurya Empire under Emperor Ashoka of Magadha in the third century BCE. The empire's patronage made the islands a centre of Hindu and Buddhist religion and culture.3 Buddhist monks, scholars, and artists created the artwork, inscriptions, and sculpture of the Kanheri Caves in the mid third century BCE4 and Mahakali Caves.5 After the decline of the Maurya Empire around 185 BCE, these islands fell to the Satavahanas.6 The port of Sopara (present-day Nala Sopara) was an important trading centre during the first century BCE,7 with trade contacts with Rome.8
 The islands were known as Heptanesia (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150 CE.9 The Koli fishing community were the earliest inhabitants of these islands.10 After the end of the Satvahana rule in 250 CE, the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra and Vakatakas of Vidarbha held dominion over the islands. The Abhiras ruled for 167 years, till around 417 CE. The Kalachuris of Central India ruled the islands during the fifth century, which were then acquired by the Mauryas in the sixth and early part of the seventh century.11 The Mauryas were feudatories of Kalachuris,12 and the Jogeshwari Caves were constructed during their regime between 520 to 525.13 The Elephanta Caves also dates back to the sixth century.14 Christianity arrived in the islands during the sixth century, when the Nestorian Church made its presence in India.15 The Mauryan presence ended when the Chalukyas of Badami under Pulakesi II invaded the islands in 610. Dantidurga of the Rashtrakuta Dynasty of Karnataka conquered the islands during 749-750.16 The Silhara dynasty of Konkan ruled the region between 810 and 1260.17 The Banganga Tank18 and Walkeshwar Temple19 were constructed under the patronage of the Silhara rulers during the 12th century. The Italian merchant Marco Polo and the Arab explorer Ibn Batuta had sailed through the islands, but never landed here.20 King Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in Mahikawati (present day Mahim).21 He built the first Babulnath temple in the region and introduced many fruit-bearing trees, including coconut palms to the islands.22 The Pathare Prabhus, one of the earliest settlers of the city, were brought to Mahim23 from Patan24 and other parts of Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev during his reign.25 He is also supposed to have brought Palshis, Pachkalshis, Bhandaris, Vadvals, Bhois, Agris and Brahmins to these islands.26 After his death in 1303, he was succeeded by his son Pratapbimba, who built his capital at Marol in Salsette, which he named Pratappur. The islands were wrested from Pratapbimba's control by Mubarak Khan, a self-proclaimed regent of the Khilji dynasty, who occupied Mahim and Salsette in 1318. Pratapbimba later reconquered the islands which he ruled till 1331. Later, his brother-in-law Nagardev for 17 years till 1348. The islands came under the control of the Muzaffarid dynasty of Gujarat in 1348, ending the sovereignty of Hindu rulers over the islands of Bombay.27
Islamic period (1348 - 1534)
 The islands were under the Muzaffarid dynasty from 1348 to 1391. A group of Konkani Muslims called Naitias or Navayats from Bhatkal in Karnataka first appeared in these islands during their rule.28 After the establishment of the Gujarat Sultanate in 1391, Muzaffar Shah I was appointed viceroy of north Konkan.29 For the administration of the islands, he appointed a governor for Mahim. During the reign of Ahmad Shah I (1411 - 1443), Malik-us-Sharq was appointed governor of Mahim, and he improved the existing revenue system of the islands. During the early 15th century, the Bhandaris seized the island of Mahim from the Sultanate and ruled it for eight years. It was reconquered by Rai Qutb of the Gujarat Sultanate.30 Firishta, a Persian historian, recorded that by 1429 the seat of government of the Gujarat Sultanate in north Konkan had transferred from Thane to Mahim.31 On Rai Qutb's death in 1429-1430, Ahmad Shah I Wali of the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan captured Salsette and Mahim.32
 Ahmad Shah I retaliated by sending his son Jafar Khan to recapture the lost territory. Jafar emerged victorious in the battle fought between him and Ahmad Shah I Wali. In 1431, Mahim was recaptured by the Sultanate of Gujarat. Thet Sultanate's patronage led to the construction of many Islamic mosques, prominent being the Haji Ali Dargah in Mahim, built in honour the Muslim saint Haji Ali in 1431.33 On the Gujarat commandant of Mahim Kutb Khan's death after a few years, Ahmad Shah I Wali again despatched a large army to capture Mahim. In response, Ahmad Shah I sent down a huge army and navy under Jafar Khan. The defeat of Ahmad Shah I Wali in the battle witnessed the freedom of the islands from attacks by the Bahmani Sultanate.34 Later, the islands came under Bahadur Khan Gilani of the Gujarat Sultanate. During 1491&lt;U+2013&gt;1494, the islands were wrested from Gilani's control by the Bahamani general Mahmud Gavan.35 Portuguese explorer Francisco de Almeida's ship sailed into the deep natural harbour of the island in 1508, and he called it Bom Bahia (Good Bay).36 However, the Portuguese paid their first visit to the islands on 21 January 1509, when they landed at Mahim after capturing a Gujarat barge in the Bandra creek.37 After a series of attacks by the Gujarat Sultanate, the islands were recaptured by Sultan Bahadur Shah from Mahmud Gavan.38
In 1526, the Portuguese established their factory at Bassein.39 During 1528-29, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio seized the fort of Mahim from the Gujarat Sultanate, when the King was at war with Nizam-ul-mulk, the emperor of Cheul, a town south of the islands.40 Bahadur Shah had grown apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun and he was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the islands of Bombay and Bassein were offered to the Portuguese.41 Bassein and the seven islands were surrendered later by a treaty of peace and commerce between Bahadur Shah and Nuno da Cunha on 25 October 1535, ending the Islamic rule in Bombay.42
Portuguese period (1534 - 1661)
 The Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their religious orders in Bombay. The islands were leased to Mestre Diogo in 1534. The San Miguel (St. Michael Church) in Mahim, one of the oldest churches in Bombay, was built by the Portuguese in 1540.43 Parel, Wadala, Sion, and Worli were granted to Manuel Serr&lt;U+00E3&gt;o between 1545 and 1548,44 during the viceroyalty of Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o de Castro.45 Salsette was granted for three years to Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Rodrigues Dantas, Cosme Corres, and Manuel Corres.46 Trombay and Chembur were granted to Dom Roque Tello de Menezes,47 and the Island of Pory (Elephanta Island) to Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Pirez in 1548.48 Garcia de Orta, a Portuguese physician and botanist, was granted the possession of Bombay in 155449 by viceroy Pedro Mascarenhas.50
The Portuguese encouraged intermarriage with the local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. They started the Inquisition in India in 1560, which resulted in forcible conversions to Christianity of the local Koli population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein.51 These Christians were known as Portuguese Christians, who later came to be known as the East Indian Catholics (after the British East India Company) during the British regime.52 On Garcia's death in Goa in 1570, the possession of the islands were passed on to his sons. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. The island of Salsette also exported rice. Bandra, Parel, Wadala, and Sion were given to the Portuguese Jesuits,53 and they built the St. Andrew Church at Bandra in 1570.54 They set up their base at Mazagaon, and claimed ownership of the land. King Sebastian of Portugal refused to handover the land to them, and in 1572 granted the islands in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family.55
The annexation of Portugal by Spain in 1580 opened the way for other European powers to follow the spice routes to Bombay. The Dutch arrived first, closely followed by the British.56 The first English merchants arrived in Bombay on 10 November 1583, and travelled through Bassein, Thane, and Chaul.57 The Portuguese Franciscans had obtained practical control of Salsette and Mahim by 1585, and built Nossa Senhora de Bom Concelho (Our Lady of Good Country) at Sion and Nossa Senhora de Salva&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00E3&gt;o (Our Lady of Salvation) at Dadar.58 The Battle of Swally was fought between the British and the Portuguese at Surat in 1612 for the possession of Bombay.59 Dorabji Nanabhoy, a trader, was the first Parsi to settle in Bombay in 1640.60 Castella de Aguada (Fort of the Waterpoint) was built by the Portuguese at Bandra in 1640 as a watchtower overlooking the Mahim Bay, the Arabian Sea and the southern island of Mahim.61 The growing power of the Dutch by the middle of the seventeenth century forced the Surat Council of the British Empire to acquire Bombay from King John IV of Portugal in 1659.62 The marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Portugal on 8 May 1661 placed Bombay in British possession as a part of Catherine's dowry to Charles.63
British period (1661 - 1947)
Struggle with native powers (1661 - 1817)
 On 18 January 1665, Charles II granted Humphrey Cooke the possession of Bombay.64 However, Salsette, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession.65 Later, Cooke managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala for the English. On 21 September 1668, the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, led to the transfer of Bombay from Charles II to the British East India Company for an annual rent of &lt;U+00A3&gt;10 (equivalent retail price index of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,226 in 2007).66 The Company immediately set about the task of opening up the islands by constructing a quay and warehouses. A customs house was also built. Fortifications were built around Bombay Castle. A Judge-Advocate was appointed for the purpose of civil administration.67 George Oxenden became the first Governor of Bombay under the British East India Company68 on 23 September 1668.69 Gerald Aungier, who was appointed Governor of Bombay on July 1669, established the first mint in Bombay in 1670.70 He offered various business incentives, which attracted Parsis, Armenians, Jews, Dawoodi Bohras, Gujarati Banias from Surat and Diu, and Brahmins from Salsette.71 He also planned extensive fortifications in the city from Dongri in the north to Mendham's Point (near present day Lion Gate) in the south. The harbour was also developed during his governorship, with space for the berthing of 20 ships.72 In 1670, the Parsi businessman Bhimjee Parikh imported the first printing press into Bombay.73 Between 1661 and 1675 there was a sixfold increase in population from 10,000 to 60,000.74 Yakut Khan, the Siddi admiral of the Mughal Empire, landed at Bombay in October 1672 and ravaged the local inhabitants there.75 On 20 February 1673, Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India attacked Bombay, but the attack was resisted by Aungier.76 On 10 October 1673, the Siddi admiral Sambal entered Bombay and destroyed the Pen and Nagothana rivers, which were very important for the British.77 The Treaty of Westminster concluded between England and the Netherlands in 1674, relieved the British settlements in Bombay of further apprehension from the Dutch.78 In 1686, the Company shifted its main holdings from Surat to Bombay.79
 Yakut Khan landed at Sewri on 14 February 1689,80 and razed the Mazagon Fort in June 1690.81 After a payment made by the British to Aurangzeb, the ruler of the Mughal Empire, Yakut evacuated Bombay on 8 June 1690.82 The arrival of many Indian and British merchants led to the development of Bombay's trade. Soon it was trading in salt, rice, ivory, cloth, lead and sword blades with many Indian ports as well as with the Arabian ports of Mecca and Basra.83 By the end of the seventeenth century, Bombay had developed into an important port.84 By 1710, the construction of Bombay Castle was finished, which fortified the islands from sea attacks by European pirates and the Marathas.85 By 26 December 1715, Charles Boone assumed the Governorship of Bombay. He implemented Aungier's plans for the fortification of the island, and had walls built from Dongri in the north to Mendham's point in the south.86 He established a force of Marines87 and constructed the St. Thomas Cathedral in 1718, which was the first Anglican Church in Bombay.88 In 1728, a Mayor's court was established in Bombay and the first reclamation was started which was a temporary work in Mahalaxmi, on the creek separating Bombay from Worli.89 The shipbuilding industry started in Bombay in 173590 and soon the Naval Dockyard was established in the same year.91
 In 1737, Salsette was captured by Baji Rao I of the Maratha Empire from the Portuguese, and the Portuguese province of Bassein was ceded to the Marathas in 1739.92 The Maratha victory forced the British to push settlements within the fort walls of the city. Under new building rules set up in 1748, many houses were demolished and the population was redistributed, partially on newly reclaimed land.93 Lovji Nusserwanjee Wadia, a member of the Wadia family of shipwrights and naval architects from Surat, built the Bombay Dock in 1750,94 which was the first dry dock to be commissioned in Asia.95 By the middle of the eighteenth century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town and soon Bhandaris from Chaul in Maharashtra, Vanjaris from the Western Ghat mountain ranges of Maharashtra, Africans from Madagascar, Bhatias from Rajasthan, Banias, Shenvi Brahmins, goldsmiths, ironsmiths and weavers from Gujarat migrated to the islands.96 In 1769, Fort George was built on the site of the Dongri Fort97 and in 1770, the Mazagaon docks were built.98 The British occupied Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja on 28 December 1774.99 In 1777, Bombay's first English newspaper, the Bombay Courier, was printed by Rustomji Kashaspathi.100 Salsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja were formally ceded to the British East India Company by the Treaty of Salbai signed in 1782, while Bassein and its dependencies were restored to Raghunathrao of the Maratha Empire.101 Although Salsette was under the British, but the introduction of contraband goods from Salsette to other parts of Bombay was prevented. The goods were subjected to Maratha regulations with respect to taxes and a 30% toll was levied on all goods into the city from Salsette.102 In 1782, William Hornby assumed the office of Governor of Bombay, and initiated the Hornby Vellard engineering project of uniting the seven islands into a single landmass. The purpose of this project was to block the Worli creek and prevent the low-lying areas of Bombay from being flooded at high tide.103 However, the project was rejected by the British East India Company in 1783.104 In 1784, the Hornby Vellard project was completed and soon reclamations at Worli and Mahalaxmi followed.105 In 1795, the Maratha army defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad. Following this, many artisans and construction workers from Andhra Pradesh migrated to Bombay and settled into the flats which were constructed by the Hornby Vellard. These workers where called Kamathis, and their enclave was called Kamathipura.106 By the end of the eighteenth century, a regular civic administration was set up in the city107 and the construction of the Sion Causeway (Duncan Causeway) commenced in 1798.108 Bombay and Mahim were united by the Hornby Vellard during the start of the 19th century.109 The construction of the Sion Causeway (Duncan Causeway) was completed in 1802 by Governor Jonathan Ducan.110 On February 17, 1803, a fire raged through the town, razing many localities around the Old Fort, subsequently the British has to plan a new town with wider roads 111112 On May 1804, Bombay was hit by a severe famine, which led to a large scale emigration.113 On 5 November 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone114 defeated Bajirao II, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, in the Battle of Kirkee which took place on the Deccan Plateau.115 The success of the British campaign in the Deccan witnessed the freedom of Bombay from all attacks by native powers.116
City development (1817 - 1885)
 The educational and economic progress of the city began with the Company's military successes in the Deccan. The Wellington Pier (Apollo Bunder) in the north of Colaba was opened for passenger traffic in 1819. The Elphinstone High School was built in 1822. Bombay was hit by a water famine in 1824. The construction of the new mint commenced in 1825.117 The construction of a good carriage road up the Bhor Ghat during the regimes of Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir John Malcolm, opened the Bombay Island to the Deccan. This Ghat, opened on 10 November 1830, facilitated the trade of Bombay in a large measure.118 By 1830, regular communication with England started by steamers navigating the Red and Mediterranean Sea.119 In July 1832, the Parsi riots took place in consequence of a Government order for the destruction of pariah dogs which infested the city. The Town Hall was completed in 1833.120 The Elphinstone College was built in 1835.121 In 1836, the Chamber of Commerce was established.122 In 1838, the islands of Colaba and Little Colaba was connected to Bombay by the Colaba Causeway.123 In 1838, monthly communication between Bombay and London was established.124 The Bank of Bombay was opened in 1840, which is the oldest bank in the city.125 The Bank of Western India was established in 1842.126

Riots broke out between Muslims and Parsis in Octo&lt;U+00AD&gt;ber 1851, in consequence of an ill-advised article on Prophet Muhammad which appeared in the Chitra Gnyan Darpan newspaper.133 The first political organization of the Bombay Presidency, the Bombay Association, was started on 26 August 1852, vent public grievances.134 The first-ever Indian railway line began operations between Bombay and neighbouring Thane over a distance of 21 miles on 16 April 1853.135 The Bombay Spinning and Weaving Company was the first cotton mill to be established in the city on 7 July 1854 at Tardeo.136 The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway (BB&amp;CI) was incorporated in 1855.137
 The University of Bombay was the first modern institution of higher education to be established in India in 1857.138 The Commercial Bank, the Chartered Mercantile, the Agra and United Service, the Chartered and the Central Bank of Western India were established in Bombay which attracted a considerable industrial population.139 The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 increased the demand for cotton in the West, and led to an enor&lt;U+00AD&gt;mous increase in cotton-trade.140 The Victoria Gardens was opened to the public in 1862.141 The Bombay Ship&lt;U+00AD&gt;ping and Iron Shipping Companies were started in 1863 to make Bombay merchants independent of the English.142 The Bombay Coast and River Steam Navigation Company was established in 1866 for the maintenance of steam ferries between Bombay and the nearby islands;143 while the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 revolutionized the marine trade of Bombay.144 The Bombay Municipal Corporation was established in 1872, providing a modern framework of governance for the rapidly-growing city.145 The Bombay Port Trust was promulgated in 1870 for the development and administration of the port.146 Tramway communication was instituted in 1872.147 The Bombay Electric Supply and Transport (BEST), originally set up as a tramway company: Bombay Tramway Company Limited, was established in 1873.148 Violent Parsi-Muslim riots again broke out in February 1874, which were caused by an attack upon Prophet Muhammad published by a Parsi resident.149 The Bombay Gymkhana was formed in 1875.150 The Bombay Stock Exchange, the oldest stock exchange in Asia, was established in 1875.151 Electricity arrived in Bombay in 1882 and Crawford Market was the first establishment to be lit up by electricity.152 The Bombay Natural History Society was founded in 1883.153 Bombay Time, one of the two official time zones in British India, was established in 1884154 during the International Meridian Conference held at Washington, D.C in the United States.155 Bombay time was set at 4 hours and 51 minutes ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) using the 75th east meridian.156 The Princess Dock was built in 1885 as part of a scheme for improving the whole fore&lt;U+00AD&gt;shore of the Bombay harbour.157
Political consciousness and freedom struggle (1885 - 1948)
 The growth of political consciousness started after the establishment of the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885.158 The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British.159 The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28-31 December 1885.160 The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters.161 The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was also completed in 1888.162 On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured.163 In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week.164 Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time.165 On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days.166 The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improve&lt;U+00AD&gt;ment Trust on 9 December 1898167 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine.168 The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899-1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics.169 The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.170
 The Partition of Bengal in 1905 initiated the Swadeshi movement, which led to the boycotting of British goods in India.171 On 22 July 1908, Lokmanya Tilak, the principal advocate of the Swadeshi movement in Bombay, was sentenced to six years rigorous imprisonment, on the charge of writing inflammatory articles against the Government in his newspaer Kesari. The arrest led to huge scale protests across the city.172 The Bombay Chronicle started by Pherozeshah Mehta, the leader of the Indian National Congress, in 1910, played an important role in the national movement until India's Independence.173 An important event in Bombay was the visit of Mahatma Gandhi to the city on 9 January 1915.174 Mohammad Ali Jinnah was elected president of the Bombay branch of the Indian Home Rule League at its formation in 1916.175 Lord Willingdon convened the Provincial War Conference at Bombay on 10 June 1918, whose objective was to seek the co-operation of the people in the World War I measures which the British Government thought it necessary to take in the Bombay Presidency. The conference was followed by huge rallies across the city. The worldwide influenza epidemic raged through Bombay from September to December 1918, causing hundreds of deaths per day. The Lord Willingdon Memorial incident of December 1918 saw the handicap of Home Rulers in Bombay. The first important strike in the textile industry in Bombay began in January 1919.176 Bombay was the main centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha movement started by Mahatma Gandhi from February &lt;U+2014&gt; April 1919. The movement was started as a result of the Rowlatt Act, which indefinitely extended emergency measures during World War I in order to control public unrest.177
 Following World War I, which saw large movement of India troops, supplies, arms and industrial goods to and from Bombay, the city life was shut down many times during the Non-cooperation movement from 1920 to 1922.178 In 1926, the Back Bay scandal occurred, when the Bombay Development Department under the British reclaimed the Back Bay area in Bombay after the financial crisis incidental to the post-war slump in the city.179 The first electric locomotives in India were put into service from Victoria Terminus to Kurla in 1925.180 In the late 1920s, many Persians migrated to Bombay from Yazd to escape the drought in Iran.181 In the early 1930s, the nationwide Civil disobedience movement against the British Salt tax spread to Bombay.

Tata pioneered civil aviation in Bombay by flying a plane from Karachi to Bombay.184 Bombay was affected by the Great Depression of 1929, which saw a stagnation of mill industry and economy from 1933 to 1939.185 With World War II, the movements of thousands of troops, military and industrial goods and the fleet of the Royal Indian Navy made Bombay an important military base for the battles being fought in West Asia and South East Asia.186 The climatic Quit India rebellion was promulgated on 7 August 1942 by the Congress in a public meeting at Gowalia Tank.187 The Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 18 February 1946 in Bombay marked the first and most serious revolt by the Indian sailors of the Royal Indian Navy against British rule.188 On 15 August 1947, finally India was declared independent. The last British troops to leave India, the First Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry, passed through the arcade of the Gateway of India in Bombay on 28 February 1948,189 ending the 282 year long period of the British in Bombay .190
Post-independence and modern period (1948 - 2000)
 After the Partition of India on 15 August 1947, over 100,000 Sindhi refugees from the newly created Pakistan were relocated in the military camps five kilometres from Kalyan in the Bombay metropolitan region. It was converted into a township in 1949, and named Ulhasnagar by the then Governor-General of India, C.
