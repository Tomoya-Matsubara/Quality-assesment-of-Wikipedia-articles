Jack Roosevelt &quot;Jackie&quot; Robinson (January 31, 1919 &lt;U+2013&gt; October 24, 1972) was the first black Major League Baseball (MLB) player of the modern era.1 Robinson broke the baseball color line when he debuted with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. As the first black man to play in the major leagues since the 1880s, he was instrumental in bringing an end to racial segregation in professional baseball, which had relegated black players to the Negro leagues for six decades.2 The example of his character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement.34
In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over ten seasons, he played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers' 1955 World Championship. He was selected for six consecutive All-Star Games from 1949 to 1954,5 was the recipient of the inaugural MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949 &lt;U+2013&gt; the first black player so honored.6 Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. In 1997, Major League Baseball retired his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams.
Robinson was also known for his pursuits outside the baseball diamond. He was the first black television analyst in Major League Baseball, and the first black vice-president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American-owned financial institution based in Harlem, New York. In recognition of his achievements on and off the field, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.
Early life
Robinson was born on January 31, 1919, into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo, Georgia, during a Spanish flu and smallpox epidemic. He was the youngest of five children, after siblings Edgar, Frank, Matthew (nicknamed &quot;Mack&quot;), and Willa Mae.78 His middle name was in honor of former President Theodore Roosevelt, who died twenty-five days before Robinson was born.910 After Robinson's father left the family in 1920, they moved to Pasadena, California.111213 The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena. Robinson's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family.14 Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community, Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities.15 As a result, Robinson joined a neighborhood gang, but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it.161718
John Muir High School
In 1935, Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir High School (Muir Tech).19 Recognizing his athletic talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 Summer Olympics)20 and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports.2122 At Muir Tech, Robinson played several sports at the varsity level and lettered in four of them: football, basketball, track, and baseball.23 He played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team, quarterback on the football team, and guard on the basketball team. With the track and field squad, he won awards in the broad jump. He was also a member of the tennis team.24
In 1936, Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the Pomona annual baseball tournament all-star team, which included future Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon.25 In late January 1937, the Pasadena Star-News newspaper reported that Robinson &quot;for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir, starring in football, basketball, track, baseball and tennis.&quot;26
Pasadena Junior College
After Muir, Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College (PJC), where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball, football, baseball, and track.27 On the football team, he played quarterback and safety. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad jump records held by his brother Mack.28 As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white.29 While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military.3031 Also while at PJC, he was elected to the Lancers, a student-run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities.32 In 1938, he was elected to the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.3334 That year, Robinson was one of ten students named to the school's Order of the Mast and Dagger (Omicron Mu Delta), awarded to students performing &quot;outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition.&quot;35
An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist &lt;U+2013&gt; a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police.36 Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident &lt;U+2013&gt; along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police &lt;U+2013&gt; gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism.37 Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.3839
UCLA and afterward

After graduating from PJC in spring 1939,40 Robinson transferred to UCLA, where he became the school's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, football, and track.4142 He was one of four black players on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team; the others were Woody Strode, Kenny Washington, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the team's four backfield players.43 At a time when only a handful of black players existed in mainstream college football, this made UCLA college football's most integrated team.4445 In track and field, Robinson won the 1940 NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in the Long Jump, jumping 24'10.5&quot;.46 Belying his future career, baseball was Robinson's &quot;worst sport&quot; at UCLA; he hit .097 in his only season, although in his first game he went 4-for-4 and twice stole home.47
While a senior at UCLA, Robinson met his future wife, Rachel Isum, a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson's athletic career at PJC.48 In the spring semester of 1941, despite his mother's and Isum's reservations, Robinson left college just shy of graduation.49 He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government's National Youth Administration (NYA) in Atascadero, California.505152
After the government ceased NYA operations, Robinson traveled to Honolulu in fall 1941 to play football for the semi-professional, racially integrated Honolulu Bears.5354 After a short season, Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League.55 By that time, however, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place, drawing the United States into World War II and ending Robinson's nascent football career.56
Military career

In 1942, Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race-neutral, practically speaking few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership.57 As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months.58 After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War),59 the men were accepted into OCS.606162 This common military experience spawned a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis.6364 Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943.65 Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.66
After receiving his commission, Robinson was reassigned to Fort Hood, Texas, where he joined the 761st &quot;Black Panthers&quot; Tank Battalion. While at Fort Hood, 2LT Robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the Rev. Karl Downs, President of Sam Huston College (now Huston-Tillotson University) in nearby Austin, Texas; Downs had been Robinson's pastor at Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC.6768
An event on July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's military career.69 While awaiting results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson to move to the back of the bus.707172 Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody.7374 When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed.7576 After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion &lt;U+2013&gt; where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness &lt;U+2013&gt; even though Robinson did not drink.7778
By the time of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning.79 Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers.80 Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas, thus he never saw combat action.81 After his acquittal, he was transferred to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944.82 While there, Robinson met an ex-player for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League, who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout.83 Robinson took the ex-player's advice and wrote Monarchs' co-owner Thomas Baird.84
Post-military
After his discharge, Robinson briefly returned to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs.85 Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.86 The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944&lt;U+2013&gt;45 season.87 As a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games.8889 Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach,90 and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.91
Baseball career
Negro leagues
 In early 1945, while Robinson was at Sam Huston College, the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues.9293 Robinson accepted a contract for $400 ($ in  dollars) per month, a boon for him at the time.9495 Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him.9697 The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now only communicate by letter.98 In all, Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs, hitting .387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases.99 He also appeared in the 1945 Negro League All-Star Game, going hitless in five at-bats.100
During the season, Robinson pursued potential major league interest. The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16.101 The tryout, however, was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick.102 Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson was subjected to racial epithets.103 Robinson left the tryout humiliated,104 and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.105
Other teams, however, had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer. In the mid-1940s, Branch Rickey, club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers' roster. Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players, and interviewed Robinson for possible assignment to Brooklyn's International League farm club, the Montreal Royals.106 Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him.107108 In a famous three-hour exchange on August 28, 1945, Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily &lt;U+2013&gt; a concern given Robinson's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military.109 Robinson was aghast: &quot;Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back?&quot;110111 Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player &quot;with guts enough not to fight back.&quot;112113 After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; to racial antagonism, Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $600 a month, equal to $ today.114115
Although he required Robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945.116 On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season.117118119 On the same day, with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals.120 In what was later referred to as &quot;The Noble Experiment&quot;,121122 Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s.123 Robinson was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues,124 and black talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first.125
Rickey's offer allowed Robinson to leave the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides behind, and he went home to Pasadena. That September, he signed with Chet Brewer's Kansas City Royals, a post-season barnstorming team in the California Winter League.126 Later that off-season, he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team, while his fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City.127 On February 10, 1946, Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend, Rev. Karl Downs.128129130
Minor leagues
In 1946, Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach, Florida, for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League (the designation of &quot;AAA&quot; for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used in the  season). Robinson's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida. As he was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel, he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician.131132 Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility (the Dodger-controlled spring training compound in Vero Beach known as &quot;Dodgertown&quot; did not open until spring 1948),133 scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities, several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright, another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers' organization in January. In Sanford, Florida, the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there; as a result, Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach.134135 In Jacksonville, the stadium was padlocked shut without warning on game day, by order of the city's Parks and Public Property director.136137 In DeLand, a scheduled day game was called off, ostensibly because of faulty electrical lighting.138139
 After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself, the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach.140141 Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach's City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, in an exhibition game against the team's parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson thus simultaneously became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team and against a major league team since the de facto baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s.142 Later in spring training, after some less-than-stellar performances, Robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base, allowing him to make shorter throws to first base.143 Robinson's performance soon rebounded. On April 18, 1946, Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants' season opener against the Montreal Royals, marking the professional debut of the Royals' Jackie Robinson. In his five trips to the plate, Robinson had four hits, including a three-run home run. He also scored four runs, drove in three, and stole two bases in the Royals' 14&lt;U+2013&gt;1 victory.144 Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and .985 fielding percentage,145 and he was named the league's Most Valuable Player.146 Although he often faced hostility while on road trips (the Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour, for example),147 the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson.148149 Whether fans supported or opposed it, Robinson's presence on the field was a boon to attendance; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946, an amazing figure by International League standards.150 In the fall of 1946, following the baseball season, Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short-lived Los Angeles Red Devils.151152
Major leagues
Breaking the color barrier (1947)
The following year, six days before the start of the 1947 season, the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues. With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers, Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman.153 On April 15, 1947, Robinson made his major league debut at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26,623 spectators, including more than 14,000 black patrons.154 Although he failed to get a base hit, the Dodgers won 5&lt;U+2013&gt;3.155 Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line.156 Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town, abandoning their Negro league teams.157
Robinson's promotion met a generally positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players.158159 However, racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse.160 Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, &quot;I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you cannot use the money, I will see that you are all traded.&quot;161
Robinson was also derided by opposing teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played. After the threat, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended.162163164 Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents (particularly the Cardinals). At one time, he received a seven-inch gash in his leg.165 On April 22, 1947, during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, Phillies players called Robinson a &quot;nigger&quot; from their dugout and yelled that he should &quot;go back to the cotton fields&quot;.166167 Rickey later recalled that Phillies manager Ben Chapman &quot;did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers. When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse, he solidified and united thirty men.&quot;168
Robinson received significant encouragement from several major league players. Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, &quot;You can hate a man for many reasons. Color is not one of them.&quot;169 In 1948, Reese put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati.170 A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson.171 Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. After colliding with Robinson at first base on one occasion, Greenberg whispered a few words into Robinson's ear, which Robinson later characterized as &quot;words of encouragement.&quot;172 Greenberg had advised him that the best way to combat the slurs from the opposing players was to beat them on the field.173
Robinson finished the season with 12 home runs, a league-leading 29 steals, a .297 batting average, a .427 slugging percentage, and 125 runs scored.174 His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award (separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949).175

Following Stanky's trade to the Boston Braves in March 1948, Robinson took over second base, where he logged a .980 fielding percentage that year (second in the National League at the position, fractionally behind Stanky).176 Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season.177 In a 12&lt;U+2013&gt;7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29, , he hit for the cycle &lt;U+2013&gt; a home run, a triple, a double, and a single in the same game.178 The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948, but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series.179
Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues. Larry Doby (who broke the color barrier in the American League on July 5, 1947) and Satchel Paige played for the Cleveland Indians, and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson.180 In February 1948, he signed a $12,500 contract (equal to $ today) with the Dodgers; while a significant amount, this was less than Robinson made in the off-season from a vaudeville tour, where he answered pre-set baseball questions, and a speaking tour of the South. Between the tours, he underwent surgery on his right ankle. Because of his off-season activities, Robinson reported to training camp  overweight. He lost the weight during training camp, but dieting left him weak at the plate.181
In the spring of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, learning to hit the ball to right field.182 Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball.183 Robinson also noted that &quot;Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second&quot;.184 The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949.185 In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored.186 For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player award for the National League.187 Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game &lt;U+2013&gt; the first All-Star Game to include black players.188189
That year, a song about Robinson by Buddy Johnson, &quot;Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?&quot;, reached number 13 on the charts; Count Basie recorded a famous version.190 Ultimately, the Dodgers won the National League pennant, but lost in five games to the New York Yankees in the 1949 World Series.191
Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson. In July, he was called to testify before the United States House of Representatives' Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson. Robinson was reluctant to testify, but he eventually agreed to do so, fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined.192

In 1950, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman with 133.193 His salary that year was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point: $35,000194 ($ in  dollars). He finished the year with 99 runs scored, a .328 batting average, and 12 stolen bases.195 The year saw the release of a film biography of Robinson's life, The Jackie Robinson Story, in which Robinson played himself,196 and actress Ruby Dee played Rachael &quot;Rae&quot; (Isum) Robinson.197 The project had been previously delayed when the film's producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by a white man.198 The New York Times wrote that Robinson, &quot;doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture's leading role, displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star.&quot;199
Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not sit well with Dodgers co-owner Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as &quot;Rickey's prima donna&quot;.200 In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise.201 Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, &quot;Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it.&quot;202203
Pennant races and outside interests (1951&lt;U+2013&gt;1953)
Before the 1951 season, O'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals, effective at the end of Robinson's playing career. O'Malley was quoted in the Montreal Standard as saying, &quot;Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered.204205
During the 1951 season, Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row, with 137.206 He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant. During the last game of the season, in the 13th inning, he had a hit to tie the game, and then won the game with a home run in the 14th. This forced a playoff against the New York Giants, which the Dodgers lost.207

Despite Robinson's regular-season heroics, the Dodgers lost the pennant on Bobby Thomson's famous home run, known as the Shot Heard 'Round the World, on October 3, 1951. Overcoming his dejection, Robinson dutifully observed Thomson's feet to ensure he touched all the bases. Dodgers sportscaster Vin Scully later noted that the incident showed &quot;how much of a competitor Robinson was.&quot;208 He finished the season with 106 runs scored, a batting average of .335, and 25 stolen bases.209
Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952.210 He finished the year with 104 runs, a .308 batting average, and 24 stolen bases.211 He did, however, record a career-high on-base percentage of .436.212 The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before, winning the National League pennant before losing the 1952 World Series to the New York Yankees in seven games. That year, on the television show Youth Wants to Know, Robinson challenged the Yankees' general manager, George Weiss, on the racial record of his team, which had yet to sign a black player.213 Sportswriter Dick Young, whom Robinson had described as a &quot;bigot&quot;, said, &quot;If there was one flaw in Jackie, it was the common one. He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness.&quot;214 The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base. Afterward, Robinson played variously at first, second, and third bases, shortstop, and in the outfield, with Jim Gilliam, another black player, taking over everyday second base duties.215 Robinson's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team. He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the Puerto Rican Winter League, but according to the New York Post, Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request.216
In 1953, Robinson had 109 runs, a .329 batting average, and 17 steals,217 leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant (and another World Series loss to the Yankees, this time in six games). Robinson's continued success spawned a string of death threats.218 He was not dissuaded, however, from addressing racial issues publicly. That year, he served as editor for Our Sports magazine, a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson's old friend Joe Louis.219220 Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization; a number of these establishments integrated as a result, including the five-star Chase Park Hotel in St. Louis.221222
World Championship and retirement (1954&lt;U+2013&gt;1956)
In 1954, Robinson had 62 runs, a .311 batting average, and 7 steals. His best day at the plate was on June 17, when he hit two home runs and two doubles.223224 The following autumn, Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Although the team enjoyed ultimate success, 1955 was the worst year of Robinson's individual career. He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases. The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a third baseman, both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base.225 Robinson, then 37 years old, missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series.226 Robinson missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base. That season, the Dodgers' Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year.227
In 1956, Robinson had 61 runs, a .275 batting average, and 12 steals.228 By then, he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes, and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball.229 After the season, Robinson was traded by the Dodgers to the arch-rival New York Giants for Dick Littlefield and $35,000 cash (equal to $ today). The trade, however, was never completed; unbeknownst to the Dodgers, Robinson had already agreed with the president of Chock full o'Nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company.230 Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to Look magazine two years previously,231 his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine, instead of through the Dodgers organization.232
Legacy

Robinson's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball, known as the baseball color line.233 After World War II, several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks, including their accelerated migration of to the North, where their political clout grew, and President Harry Truman's desegregation of the military in 1948.234 Robinson's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that he was &quot;a legend and a symbol in his own time&quot;, and that he &quot;challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration.&quot;235 According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robinson's &quot;efforts were a monumental step in the civil-rights revolution in America ... [His] accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone's abilities.&quot;236
Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty-eight, he played only ten seasons, all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers.237 During his career, the Dodgers played in six World Series, and Robinson himself played in six All-Star Games.238 In 1999, he was posthumously named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.239
Robinson's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post&lt;U+2013&gt;&quot;long ball&quot; era in baseball, in which a reliance on raw power-hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used footspeed to create runs through aggressive baserunning.240 Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era. He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons (averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953), had a .311 career batting average, a .409 career on-base percentage, a .474 slugging percentage, and substantially more walks than strikeouts (740 to 291).241242243 Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947&lt;U+2013&gt;56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 (Minnie Mi&lt;U+00F1&gt;oso was the other).244 He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total,245 including 19 steals of home. None of the latter were double steals (in which a player stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same time).246 Robinson has been referred to by author David Falkner as &quot;the father of modern base-stealing.&quot;247
Historical statistical analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his ten years in the major leagues and at virtually every position he played.248 After playing his rookie season at first base,249 Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman.250 He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951.251252 Toward the end of his career, he played about 2,000 innings at third base and about 1,175 innings in the outfield, excelling at both.253
Assessing himself, Robinson said, &quot;I'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me ... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being.&quot;254 Regarding Robinson's qualities on the field, Leo Durocher said, &quot;Ya want a guy that comes to play. This guy didn't just come to play. He come to beat ya. He come to stuff the goddamn bat right up your ass.&quot;255
Post-baseball life
Robinson retired from baseball on January 5, 1957.256 Later that year, after he complained of numerous physical ailments, his doctors diagnosed Robinson with diabetes, a disease that also affected his brothers.257 Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen, the state of medicine at the time could not prevent continued deterioration of Robinson's physical condition from the disease.258  In his first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962,259 Robinson encouraged voters to consider only his on-field qualifications, rather than his cultural impact on the game.260 He was elected on the first ballot, becoming the first black player inducted into the Cooperstown museum.261
In 1965, Robinson served as an analyst for ABC's Major League Baseball Game of the Week telecasts, the first black person to do so.262 In 1966, Robinson was hired as general manager for the short-lived Brooklyn Dodgers of the Continental Football League.263264
On June 4, 1972, the Dodgers retired his uniform number, 42, alongside those of Roy Campanella (39) and Sandy Koufax (32).265 From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was the vice president for personnel at Chock full o'Nuts; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation.266267 Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry.268 Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967.269 In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank &lt;U+2013&gt; a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem.270 He also served as the bank's first Chairman of the Board.271 In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.272273
Robinson was active in politics throughout his post-baseball life. He identified himself as a political independent274275 although he held conservative opinions on several issues, including the Vietnam War (he once wrote Martin Luther King, Jr. to defend the Johnson Administration's military policy).276 After supporting Richard Nixon in his 1960 presidential race against John F. Kennedy, Robinson later praised Kennedy effusively for his stance on civil rights.277 He subsequently supported Hubert Humphrey against Nixon in 1968.278 In 1964, Robinson became one of six national directors for Nelson Rockefeller's Republican presidential campaign and later became special assistant for community affairs when Rockefeller was re-elected governor of New York in 1966.279
Protesting the major leagues' ongoing lack of minority managers and central office personnel, Robinson turned down an invitation to appear in an old-timers' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969.280 He made his final public appearance on October 15, 1972, throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 of the World Series. He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his MLB debut, but also commented, &quot;I'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I look at that third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball.&quot;281 This wish was fulfilled only after Robinson's death: following the 1974 season, the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson (no relation), a Hall of Fame-bound player who would go on to manage three other teams. Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players, the number of African-American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s.282
Family life and death
After Robinson's retirement from baseball, his wife, Rachel Robinson, pursued a career in academic nursing &lt;U+2013&gt; she became an assistant professor at the Yale School of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center.283 She also served on the board of the Freedom National Bank until it closed in 1990.284 She and Jackie had three children: Jackie Robinson Jr. (born November 18, 1946), Sharon Robinson (born January 13, 1950), and David Robinson (born May 14, 1952).285
Robinson's family gravesite in Cypress Hills Cemetery. Robinson is buried alongside his mother-in-law Zellee Isum and his son Jackie Robinson, Jr.
Robinson's eldest son, Jackie Robinson Jr., had emotional trouble during his childhood and entered special education at an early age.286 He enrolled in the Army in search of a disciplined environment, served in the Vietnam War, and was wounded in action on November 19, 1965.287 After his discharge, he struggled with drug problems. Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at Daytop Village in Seymour, Connecticut, and became a counselor at the institution.288 On June 17, 1971, at the age of 24, he was killed in an automobile accident.289290 The experience with his son's drug addiction turned Robinson, Sr. into an avid anti-drug crusader toward the end of his life.291
Robinson did not long outlive his son. Complications of heart disease and diabetes weakened Robinson and made him almost blind by middle age. On October 24, 1972, he died of a heart attack at home in Stamford, Connecticut, aged fifty-three.292293 Robinson's funeral service on October 27, 1972, at New York City's Riverside Church attracted 2,500 admirers.294 Many of his former teammates and other famous black baseball players served as pallbearers, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy.295 Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where he is buried next to his son Jackie and mother-in-law Zellee Isum.296 Jackie Robinson Parkway also runs through the cemetery.297
After Robinson's death, his widow founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation, of which she remains an officer as of 2009.298299 On April 15, 2008, she announced that in 2010 the foundation will be opening a museum devoted to Jackie in Lower Manhattan.300 Robinson's daughter, Sharon, became a midwife, educator, director of educational programming for MLB, and the author of two books about her father.301 His youngest son, David, who has ten children, is a coffee grower and social activist in Tanzania.302303
Awards and recognition
According to a poll conducted in 1947, Robinson was the second most popular man in the country, behind Bing Crosby.304 In 1999, he was named by Time on its list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.305 Also in 1999, he ranked number 44 on the Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-getter among second basemen.306307 Baseball writer Bill James, in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, ranked Robinson as the 32nd greatest player of all time strictly on the basis of his performance on the field, noting that he was one of the top players in the league throughout his career.308 Robinson was among the 25 charter members of UCLA&lt;U+2019&gt;s Athletics Hall of Fame in 1984.309 In 2002, Molefi Kete Asante included Robinson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.310 Robinson has also been honored by the United States Postal Service on three separate postage stamps, in 1982, 1999, and 2000.311
Memorial in the Jackie Robinson Rotunda inside Citi Field, dedicated April 15, 2009|alt=An eight-foot blue sculpture of a stylized uniform number, 42, set atop a polished interior walkway
The City of Pasadena has recognized Robinson in several ways. Brookside Park, situated next to the Rose Bowl, features a baseball diamond and stadium named Jackie Robinson Field.312 The city's Human Services Department operates the Jackie Robinson Center, a community outreach center that provides early diabetes detection and other services.313 In 1997, a $325,000 bronze sculpture (equal to $ today) by artists Ralph Helmick, Stu Schecter, and John Outterbridge depicting oversized nine-foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected at Garfield Avenue, across from the main entrance of Pasadena City Hall; a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project, which was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported by members of the Robinson family.314315
Major League Baseball has honored Robinson many times since his death. In 1987, both the National and American League Rookie of the Year Awards were renamed the &quot;Jackie Robinson Award&quot; in honor of the first recipient (Robinson's Major League Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 encompassed both leagues).316317 On April 15, 1997, Robinson's jersey number, 42, was retired throughout Major League Baseball, the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major American sports leagues.318
As an exception to the retired-number policy, MLB has recently begun honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number.319 After receiving her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same.320 Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates.321 The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42.322323 On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics.324 In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.325
Headquarters of the Jackie Robinson Foundation and planned home of the Jackie Robinson Museum and Learning Center
At the November 2006 groundbreaking for a new ballpark for the New York Mets, Citi Field, it was announced that the main entrance, modeled on the one in Brooklyn's old Ebbets Field, would be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. The rotunda was dedicated at the opening of Citi Field on April 16, 2009.326 It honors Robinson with large quotations spanning the inner curve of the facade and features a large freestanding statue of his number, 42, which has become an attraction in itself. Mets owner Fred Wilpon announced that, in conjunction with Citigroup and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the Mets will create a Jackie Robinson Museum and Learning Center, located at the headquarters of the Jackie Robinson Foundation at One Hudson Square in lower Manhattan. The main purpose of the museum will be to fund scholarships for &quot;young people who live by and embody Jackie's ideals.&quot;327328
Robinson has also been recognized outside of baseball. In December 1956, the NAACP recognized him with the Spingarn Medal, which it awards annually for the highest achievement by an African-American.329 President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on March 26, 1984,330 and on March 2, 2005, President George W. Bush gave Robinson's widow the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress; Robinson was only the second baseball player to receive the award, after Roberto Clemente.331 On August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver, announced that Robinson was inducted into the California Hall of Fame, located at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento.332

A number of buildings have been named in Robinson's honor. The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium,333 which, because of the efforts of Jackie's brother Mack, features a memorial statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis.334 City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida &lt;U+2013&gt; the baseball field that became the Dodgers' de facto spring training site in 1947 &lt;U+2013&gt; was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in 1989.335 A number of facilities at Pasadena City College (successor to PJC) are named in Robinson's honor, including Robinson Field, a football/soccer/track facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack.336 The New York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson,337 and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after him.338 In 1976, his home in Brooklyn, the Jackie Robinson House, was declared a National Historic Landmark.339 Robinson also has an asteroid named after him, 4319 Jackierobinson.340 In 1997, the United States Mint issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar, and five dollar gold coin.341 That same year, New York City renamed the Interboro Parkway in his honor.
In 2011, the US plans to place a plaque at his Montreal home to honour the begin of the end of segragtion in baseball.342 The home is located at 8232 avenue de Gaspe south of rue de Guizot Est and near Jarry Park and close to Delorimier Stadium, where Robinson played for the Montreal Royals during 1946.

a The sacrifice fly (SF) as a unique statistical category did not exist in Major League Baseball from 1940 through 1953. Any pre-1954 sacrifice flies by Robinson would be reflected in the sacrifice hit (SH) category.
b Likewise, the intentional walk (IBB) category only became a unique statistic beginning in 1955.345 Any intentional walks issued to Robinson before that year would be reflected in the walk (BB) category.

Sources point to various reasons for Robinson's departure from UCLA. Family sources cite financial concerns.  In addition, Robinson himself cited his growing disillusionment about the value of a college degree for a black man of his era. Robinson, Jackie, p. 11. Other sources suggest that Robinson was uninterested in academics, and behind on class work at the time he left UCLA. Falkner, p. 45; Eig, p. 13.↩

Under the terms of the retirement, a grandfather clause allowed handful of players who wore number 42 to continue doing so in tribute to Robinson, until such time as they subsequently changed teams or jersey numbers.  This affected players such as the Mets' Butch Huskey and Boston's Mo Vaughn. The Yankees' Mariano Rivera is the last player in Major League Baseball to wear jersey number 42 on a regular basis.  Since 1997, only Wayne Gretzky's number 99, retired by the NHL in 2000, has been retired league-wide. ↩
