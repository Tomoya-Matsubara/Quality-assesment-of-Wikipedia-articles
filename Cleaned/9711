Early life
Gevinson was born in Chicago, and is being raised in the suburban town of Oak Park, Illinois.1 Her father, Steve Gevinson, is a retired English high school teacher.2 Her mother, Berit Engen, is a weaver and part-time Hebrew instructor who grew up in Oslo, Norway.34 Gevinson's father was born to an Orthodox Jewish family, while her mother, who was raised a Lutheran, converted to Judaism in 2001.567 Gevinson and her two older sisters, Rivkah and Miriam, were raised in the Jewish faith.89
Gevinson was educated at Oak Park and River Forest High School in Illinois.10 She is taking a gap year in the 2014/2015 academic year before attending a New York university.11
Career
2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2011: StyleRookie
Gevinson started a fashion blog, Style Rookie, in 2008.12 The blog, featuring photos of the eleven-year-old in distinctive outfits and her commentary on the latest fashion trends, began drawing nearly 30,000 readers each day.13 Her father &quot;wasn't terribly interested&quot; in her new hobby until she asked for his permission to be interviewed by The New York Times for an article about young bloggers.14 Because of the blog's success, Gevinson was invited to attend New York Fashion Week and Paris Fashion Week. She made overseas fashion-related trips to Tokyo and Antwerp, funded by Pop magazine,15 and was commissioned to write articles for Harper's Bazaar and Barneys.com. She styled a shoot for BlackBook magazine,16 acted as a muse and model for Rodarte's clothing line at Target stores,1718 and partnered with Borders&amp;Frontiers to design and sell her own t-shirt.19 In 2010, she spoke at a marketing conference in New York and at Idea City, a Canadian version of the TED conference.20
There was a backlash to Gevinson's early success in the fashion industry. New York Magazine questioned whether it was possible for Gevinson to write her blog without &quot;some help from a mom or older sister&quot;.21 Sarah Mower of The Daily Telegraph, while conceding that Gevinson had a &quot;truly independent, original voice&quot;, criticized her father for taking her out of school &quot;to go to haute couture shows ... It's hard to imagine a kid being able to come back down to reality.&quot;22 A Grazia fashion editor complained on Twitter that a large bow worn by Gevinson had blocked her view of a runway during fashion week.23 Anne Slowey of Elle felt her success was &quot;gimmicky&quot; and commented, &quot;She&lt;U+2019&gt;s been thirteen for, like, the last four years.&quot;24 Gevinson later remarked: &lt;U+201C&gt;A lot of people on the Internet have a problem with a young person doing well. I felt like, there were people who were [at fashion week] because of their name, their money or their family, and I didn&lt;U+2019&gt;t have any of those things.&lt;U+201D&gt;25
2011&lt;U+2013&gt;present: Rookie and acting roles
In early 2011, Gevinson decided to stop writing primarily about fashion: &quot;Lately I've been looking to other places for a creative outlet and for inspiration ... Now I'm more intrigued by mixing fashion with the other stuff I've been enjoying.&quot;26 Gevinson's personal style also became less outlandish: &quot;Before, dressing up was my outlet, and now I&lt;U+2019&gt;m pursuing other creative things that take up a lot of time and energy, so in the morning I usually want to put on something simple and comfortable.&quot;2728
In the fall of 2011, at the age of fifteen, Gevinson founded Rookie Magazine.2930 The site was originally conceived of as a joint venture with Jane Pratt but Gevinson ultimately decided to maintain sole ownership.31 Ira Glass acts as a mentor figure to Gevinson. The website focuses on issues impacting teenage girls and is written mainly by teenage girls. It also features guest contributors such as Judd Apatow, Miranda July, Lena Dunham, Paul Rudd, Joss Whedon, Jon Hamm and John Waters. A one-off print edition of the magazine, Rookie Yearbook One, was published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2012.32 In 2012, Gevinson spoke at TEDxTeen, with a focus on representation of women in popular culture, and at The Economist's World in 2012 Festival.3334 She is also a contributing editor at Garage Magazine.35 In both 2011 and 2012, Gevinson appeared on the Forbes 30 Under 30 in Media list.36
