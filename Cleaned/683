History
  The town was first established by Agust&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Eguren as Ed&lt;U+00E9&gt;n Argentino (&quot;Argentine Eden&quot;), a bedroom community, in 1873. Its population remained in the few hundreds until, in 1890, the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway inaugurated a rail yard in the adjoining Villa Gal&lt;U+00ED&gt;ndez, to the east; La Fraternidad, one of Argentina's first and oldest trade unions, was founded by workers at the site in 1887. Further such installations opened by Eliseo Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez and the Ram&lt;U+00ED&gt;rez de Lafuente family in 1901 made the area a prime rail operations hub, and the Great Southern inaugurated its first commuter station there in 1902.
The Club Atl&lt;U+00E9&gt;tico Talleres de Remedios de Escalada, the town's first football club, was established in 1906, and plays in the lower leagues of Argentine football. The town became home to a sizable community of Italian Argentines in the subsequent years, and prominent among these was Luis M&lt;U+00E1&gt;spero, who operated one of the country's largest hat factories, and V&lt;U+00ED&gt;ctor Marangoni, owner of an important metalworks establishment; the Italian Mutual Insurance and Assistance Company was established here in 1913.
A number of important cooperatives, notably El Hogar Argentino (1911) and La Internacional (1914), opened in the town during that era, as did La Idea, a news daily, in 1915, and the Uni&lt;U+00F3&gt;n Ferroviaria, a nationally prominent yellow union organized as a counterweight to the intransigent La Fraternidad, in 1921. The Roman Catholic Parish of Nuestra Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;ora de los Remedios (&quot;Our Lady of Remedies&quot;) was consecrated in 1924, and in 1933, Villa Gal&lt;U+00ED&gt;ndez and the Argentine Eden were incorporated as Remedios de Escalada (in honor of Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a de los Remedios de Escalada, wife of the leader of the Argentine War of Independence, General Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de San Mart&lt;U+00ED&gt;n).
Remedios de Escalada was formally declared a city by the Buenos Aires Province Legislature in 1974. The city later suffered from the effects of a failed plan in during the 1976-83 dictatorship to expand the General Paz Freeway from the Villa Riachuelo ward in Buenos Aires to the city of Avellaneda; never completed, the demolitions resulting from the project left an extensive swath along the city of empty lots which, in many cases, were not adequately reurbanized. The National University of Lan&lt;U+00FA&gt;s, one of the smaller national universities, was established here in 1995.
