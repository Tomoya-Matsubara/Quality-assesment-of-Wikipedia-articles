John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is a  park in eastern Oregon. Located within the John Day River Basin, this U.S. National Monument is world renowned for its well preserved, remarkably complete record of fossil plants and animals, a record that spans more than 40 of the 65 million years of the Cenozoic Era (also known as the Age of Mammals and Flowering Plants). The monument is divided into three units: Painted Hills (named for the delicately colored stratifications) northwest of Mitchell, Sheep Rock which is northwest of Dayville, and Clarno which is  west of Fossil. Blue Basin is a volcanic ash bowl transformed into claystone by eons of erosion, colored pastel blue by minerals.
Visitors can follow trails into the badlands and examine fossils displayed at the visitor center while scientists continue field investigations and the painstaking analysis of the monument's vast fossil record. The Sheep Rock unit includes the Thomas Condon Paleontology Center with exhibits of fossils, and the Cant Ranch Museum which serves as the monument's headquarters and includes exhibits about human settlements on the ranch and in the area. The museums are located 2 miles (3.2 km) miles north of Picture Gorge along Route 19 near Dayville.
Exploration and study of the John Day fossil beds continues today. In many of the beds, the fossils are widely scattered, and their occurrence cannot be predicted. Many types of fossils deteriorate rapidly once erosion exposes them to the elements. Thus the fossil beds are continually canvassed by paleontologists. Visitors often take rocks as souvenirs, which is a federal crime.
The fossil beds contain vestiges of the actual soils, rivers, ponds, watering holes, mudslides, ashfalls, floodplains, middens, trackways, prairies, and forests, in an unbroken sequence that is one of the longest continuous geological records. The rocks are rich with the evidence of ancient habitats and the dynamic processes that shaped them; they tell of sweeping changes in the John Day Basin. Great changes, too, have taken place in this area's landscape, climate, and in the kinds of plants and animals that have inhabited it.
Geography
The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument consists of three widely separated units&lt;U+2014&gt;Sheep Rock, Painted Hills, and Clarno&lt;U+2014&gt;in the John Day River basin of east-central Oregon. Located in rugged terrain in the counties of Wheeler and Grant, the park units are characterized by hills, deep ravines, and eroded fossil-bearing rock formations.1 To the west lies the Cascade Range, to the south the Ochoco Mountains, and to the east the Blue Mountains.2 Elevations within the 3 park range from .4
The Clarno Unit, the westernmost of the three units, consists of  located  west of Fossil along Oregon Route 218.5 The Painted Hills Unit, which lies about halfway between the other two units, covers .6 It is situated about  northwest of Mitchell along Burnt Ranch Road, which intersects U.S. Route 26 west of Mitchell.7 The remaining {{#tag:ref|Derived by subtracting the sizes of the Clarno and Painted Hills units from the total area of the park.|group=n}} of the park, the Sheep Rock Unit, are located along Oregon Route 19 and the John Day River upstream of the unincorporated community of Kimberly.8 The Sheep Rock Unit is further subdivided into the Mascall Formation Overlook, Picture Gorge, the James Cant Ranch Historic District, Cathedral Rock, Blue Basin, and the Foree Area, some of which are separated from one another by farms and ranches and other parcels of land that are not part of the park.9
By highway, the park headquarters, the main visitor center, and the Cant Ranch&lt;U+2014&gt;all part of the Sheep Rock Unit&lt;U+2014&gt;are  west of Dayville,10  west of the city of John Day,  east of Prineville,  northeast of Bend, and  southeast of Portland.11 The shortest highway distances from unit to unit within the park are Sheep Rock to Painted Hills, ; Painted Hills to Clarno, , and Clarno to Sheep Rock, .1213
The John Day River, a tributary of the Columbia River, flows generally north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly, generally west from Kimberly to downstream of the unincorporated community of Twickenham, and generally north thereafter.14 Rock Creek enters the river at the north end of Picture Gorge.15 Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell, then north along the eastern edge of the Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day downstream of Twickenham.16 Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek, which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno.1718
History
 People have lived in Oregon for more than 10,000 years. Evidence suggests that Sahaptin groups such as the Warm Springs, Umatilla and Wasco inhabited the north-central part of the state. Surveys have found 36 sites of archeological interest, including rock shelters and cairns, in or adjacent to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Most significant among the prehistoric sites are the Picture Gorge pictographs, consisting of six panels of rock art in the canyon at the south end of the Sheep Rock Unit. By the 18th century, Northern Paiutes had also moved into the region from further south and lived in the upper John Day basin. All of these peoples were hunter-gatherers subsisting on local resources such as as salmon, deer, elk, camas, and huckleberries.19
The John Day basin remained largely unexplored by non-natives until the mid-19th century. Lewis and Clark, who noted the John Day River while traveling along the Columbia River in 1805, did not ascend it. John Day, for whom the river is named, apparently visited only its confluence with the Columbia in 1812. In 1829, Peter Skene Ogden, working for the Hudson Bay Company (HBC), led a company of explorers and fur trappers along the river through what would later become the Sheep Rock Unit. John Work of the HBC also visited this part of the river in 1831.20
In the 1840s, thousands of settlers began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Subsequent clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.21 After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, more non-natives moved to the region, established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams.22 Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley.23 By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as the The Dalles&lt;U+2013&gt;Boise Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock.24
 In 1864, a company of soldiers sent to protect mining camps from raids by Northern Paiutes discovered fossils in the Crooked River region, south of the John Day basin. One of their leaders, Captain John M. Drake, collected some of these fossils for Thomas Condon, a missionary pastor and amateur geologist who lived in The Dalles.25 Recognizing the scientific importance of the fossils, Condon accompanied soldiers traveling through the region, where he discovered rich fossil beds along Bridge Creek and near Sheep Rock in 1865. Condon's subsequent trips to the area and his public lectures and reports about his finds led to wide interest in the fossil beds among scientists such as Edward Drinker Cope of the Academy of Natural Sciences and paleontologist Othneil C. Marsh of Yale, who accompanied Condon on a trip to the region in 1871. Condon's work led to his appointment in 1872 as Oregon's first State Geologist and to international fame for the fossil beds. Specimens from the beds were sent to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums worldwide, and by 1900 more than 100 articles and books had been published about the John Day Fossil Beds. During the first half of the 20th century, scientists such as John C. Merriam, Ralph Chaney, Frank H. Knowlton, and Alonzo W. Hancock continued work in the fossil beds, including those discovered near Clarno in about 1890.26
Remote and arid, the John Day basin near the fossil beds slowly attracted homesteaders.27 The first settler in what became the Sheep Rock Unit is thought to have been Frank Butler, who built a cabin along the river in 1877.28 In 1881, Eli Casey Officer began grazing sheep on a homestead claim in same general area.29 His son Floyd later lived there with his family and sometimes accompanied Condon on his fossil hunts.30 In 1910, James and Elizabeth Cant bought  from the Officers31 and converted it to a sheep ranch, which was eventually expanded to a sheep-and-cattle ranch of about .32
Park creation
The State of Oregon, recognizing a public interest in the fossil beds and encouraged by Merriam,33 began in the early 1930s to buy land for state parks at Picture Gorge, the Painted Hills, and Clarno that later became part of the national monument.34 In 1951 the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry established Camp Hancock, a field school for young students of geology, paleontology, and other sciences, on public lands surrounded by what would later become the Clarno Unit.3536 After much planning and political debate, the national monument was established on October 8, 1975.37
The James Cant Ranch Historic District,  that included the Cant Ranch House and nearby structures, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.38 After the monument opened in 1975, the ranch house served as headquarters for all three units. In 2004, it also became home to the Cant Ranch Historical Museum, two rooms of public exhibits about the native cultures, the Canyon City gold rush, ranching, and other topics related to region.39 The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center, a $7.5 million museum and visitor center at the Sheep Rock Unit, also opened in 1984.40 Among the center's offerings are displays of fossils, murals depicting life in the basin during eight different periods ranging from about 45 million to about 5 million years ago, and real-time views of paleontologists at work.41
Geology
 The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument lies within the Blue Mountains physiographic province, which originated during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, about 118 to 93 million years ago.42 Northeastern Oregon was assembled in large blocks (exotic terranes) of Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic rock shifted by tectonic forces and accreted to what was then the western edge of the North American continent, near the Idaho border.43 By the beginning of the Cenozoic era, 65 million years ago, the Blue Mountains province was uplifting and eroding, and the Pacific Ocean shoreline, formerly near Idaho, lay west of the new province.44
Volcanic eruptions about 44 million years ago during the Eocene deposited lavas accompanied by mud flows (lahars) atop the older rocks in the western part of the province. The mudflows of shales, siltstones, conglomerates, and breccias entombed plants and animals caught in their paths and later eroded into rock formations such as those exposed in the Clarno Unit.45 Preserved in the nut beds, palisades, and other formations of the unit are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds.46 Large animals inhabiting this region between 50 and 35 million years ago included browsers such as brontotheres and amynodonts, scavengers like the hyaenodonts, as well as Patriofelis and other predators.47 Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood, are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other buttes near Mitchell.48
The Clarno volcanics subsided by the early Oligocene but were replaced about 36 million years ago by eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of what much later became the Cascade Range.49 The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno mudflows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20 million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color.50 Laid down on top of the Clarno Formation (from the Clarno volcanics), the John Day Formation (from the John Day volcanics) consists of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost, the Big Basin member, consists of highly oxidized and deep red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit and the nearby Bridge Creek Flora site, with its Metasequoia (dawn redwood) fossils.51 The Turtle Cove member above it is mainly pea-green clay. Resting atop the Turtle Cove member are the buff-colored Kimberly and Haystack members.52 Fossils found in the John Day Formation include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 kinds of mammals, including dogs, cats, swine, oreodonts, horses, camels, and rodents.53
After another period of erosion, a series of lava eruptions from fissures across northeastern Oregon, southeastern Washington, and western Idaho inundated much of the Blue Mountain province with liquid basalt. Extruded in the middle Miocene between 17 and 12 million years ago, more than 40 separate flows contributing to the Columbia River Basalt Group have been identified, the largest of which involved up to  of lava. The most prominent of these formations within the monument is the Picture Gorge Basalt, which rests above the John Day Formation.54
Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in the late Miocene contributed to the Mascall Formation, a layer of stream-deposited volcanic tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt.55 Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of horses, antelope, camels, bears, broadleaf plants, and other life forms that thrived in the monument's open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12 million years ago.5657 The last major eruption in the late Miocene deposited the Rattlesnake Formation, capped by an ignimbrite, on top of the Mascall.58 The Rattlesnake has fossils of mastodons, camels, rhinoceroses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.5960
Fossils
The monument contains extensive deposits of well-preserved fossils from various periods spanning more than 40 million years.61 Taken as a whole, the fossils present an unusually detailed view of plants and animals since the late Eocene.62 Analysis of the John Day fossils has contributed to paleoclimatology (the study of Earth's past climates) and life-form evolution.63
Paleontologists at the park find, describe the location of, and collect fossil-bearing rocks from more than 700 sites within the monument.64 They take them to the paleontology lab at the visitor center, where the fossils are stablized, separated from their rock matrix, and cleaned.65 The fossil specimens are then catalogued, indexed, and stored in climate-controlled cabinets for retrieval by researchers worldwide.66 In addition to preparing fossils, the paleontologists coordinate the monument's basic research in paleobotany and other scientific areas and manage the fossil museum in the visitor center.67
Climate
Average precipitation, limited by the rain shadow effects of the Cascade Range and the Ochoco Mountains, varies from .68 In winter, much of the precipitation arrives as snow.69
At Mitchell, near the Painted Hills Unit, July and August are the warmest months, with an average high of  and an average low of .70 January is the coldest month, when highs average  and lows average .71 The highest recorded temperature in Mitchell was  in 1972, and the lowest was  in 1983.72 May is generally the wettest month, when precipitation averages .73
Activities
Entrance to the park and its visitor center, museums, and exhibits is free,74 and trails, overlooks, and picnic sites at all three units are open during daylight hours year-round.75 No food, lodging, or fuel is available at the park, and camping is not allowed. However, lodging, groceries, gasoline, campsites, and other amenities are available elsewhere in the region.76 Except for the Cant Ranch, individual park buildings are open every day except Federal holidays between Thanksgiving (the fourth Thursday of November) and Presidents Day (the third Monday of February). Operating hours for the main visitor center (Thomas Condon Paleontology Center) are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Its amenities include a fossil museum, theater, education classroom, bookstore, restrooms, and drinking fountains.77 Hours of operation for Cant Ranch vary seasonally.78 The ranch house contains a cultural museum, restrooms, and a drinking fountain as well as park staff headquarters.79
The Sheep Rock Unit has eight trails ranging in length from  at the Mascall Formation Overlook to  at Blue Basin.80 Four trails of a quarter-mile to  long cross parts of the Painted Hills Unit.81 At the Clarno Unit, three separate quarter-mile trails begin at a parking lot along Oregon Route 218, below the face of the Clarno Palisades.82 Many of the trails have interpretive signs about the history, geology, and fossils of the region, and three trails—Story in Stone at the Sheep Rock Unit, and Painted Cove and Leaf Hill at the Painted Hills Unit—are accessible by wheelchair.838485
Ranger-led events at the monument include indoor and outdoor talks, showings of an 18-minute orientation film, hikes in Blue Basin, Cant Ranch walking tours, and astronomy programs at the Painted Hills Unit. These events are free and do not require reservations. Specific times, which are variable, can be had from rangers at the monument.8687
Pets are allowed in developed areas and along hiking trails but must leashed or otherwise restrained. Horses are not allowed on the trails, in the picnic areas, or on bare rock exposures in undeveloped areas of the monument.88 Digging, disturbing, or collecting any of the park's natural resources, including fossils, is prohibited.89 No mountain biking is allowed on monument land, although the Malheur National Forest east of Dayville has biking trails.90 Fishing is legal from monument lands along the John Day River for anyone with an Oregon fishing license. Rafting on the John Day River is seasonally popular, although the favored runs begin at or downstream of Service Creek and do not pass through the monument.91 Risks to monument visitors include extremely hot summer temperatures and icy winter roads, two species of poisonous rattlesnakes, two species of poisonous spiders, ticks, scorpions, puncturevine, and poison ivy.92
