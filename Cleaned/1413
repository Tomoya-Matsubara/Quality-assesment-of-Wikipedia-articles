Brunswick () is the major urban and economic center in southeastern Georgia in the United States. The municipality is located on a harbor near the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 30 miles (50 km) north of Florida and 70 miles (110 km) south of South Carolina. Brunswick is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway which separates it from the Golden Isles. It is the second-largest city on Georgia's coast, after Savannah, and is the seat of government for Glynn County.
As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 15,383 with a metropolitan population of 103,841.12 The city's metropolitan area is the twelfth-largest in the state of Georgia and includes the counties of Glynn, Brantley, and McIntosh.
The city traces its roots to its 1738 settlement as a tobacco plantation by British colonists and a southern buffer to Spanish Florida. It came under provincial control in 1771 and was founded as Brunswick after the duchy of Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg in Germany, the ancestral home of the Hanoverians. It was officially incorporated in 1856.
Brunswick is near Jacksonville, Florida, and Savannah, Georgia. With a deepwater port, Brunswick supports thriving seafood and shipping industries. Naval stores, pulp and wood products, bulk cargoes, and tourism are prominent in the local economy. Additionally, the headquarters facility of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is located 5 miles (8 km) north of the central business district of the city and is adjacent to Brunswick Golden Isles Airport, which provides commercial air service to the region.
History
The Mocama, a Timucua-speaking people, originally occupied the lands in what is now Brunswick.3 The Spanish established missions in Timucuan villages beginning in 1568.4 During this time, much of the Native American population was depleted through enslavement and disease.5 When the Province of Carolina was founded in 1663, the British claimed all lands south to the 31st parallel north,6 but little colonization occurred south of the Altamaha River as the Spanish also claimed this land.7 Three years after the Province of Georgia was founded in 1733, James Oglethorpe had the town of Frederica built on St. Simons Island, challenging Spaniards who laid claim to the island.8 The Spanish were driven out of the province after British victories in the battles of Bloody Marsh and Gully Hole Creek in 1742;9 it was not until the Treaty of Paris of 1763 that Spain's threat to the province was formally ended, when all lands north of the St. Marys River and south of the Savannah River were designated as Georgia.1011
 The area's first European settler, Mark Carr, arrived in 1738.12 Carr, a Scotsman, was a captain in Oglethorpe's Marine Boat Company.13 Upon landing, he established his  tobacco plantation, which he called &quot;Plug Point&quot;, along the East and Brunswick rivers.1415 The Province of Georgia purchased Carr&lt;U+2019&gt;s fields in 1771 and laid out the town of Brunswick in the grid plan akin to that of Savannah, with large, public squares at given intervals.16 The town was named for the duchy of Brunswick-L&lt;U+00FC&gt;neburg in Germany, the ancestral home of George III and the House of Hanover.17 Brunswick was a rectangular tract of land consisting of .18 The first lot was granted on June 30, 1772; 179 lots were granted in the first three years.19 However, about this time Brunswick lost most of its citizens, many of whom were Loyalists, to East Florida, the Caribbean Basin, and the United Kingdom for protection during the American Revolutionary War.2021 From 1783 to 1788 a number of these lots were regranted and there collected in Brunswick a few families who desired proper education for their children.22 By act of the General Assembly on February 1, 1788, eight town commissioners were appointed and Glynn Academy was chartered, the funding of which was to come from the sales of town lots.232425 Brunswick was recognized as an official port of entry in 1789 by act of the United States Congress.2627 In 1797 the General Assembly transferred the seat of Glynn County from Frederica to Brunswick.2829
At the end of the eighteenth century, a large tract of land surrounding Brunswick on three sides had been laid off and designated as Commons.30 Commissioners were named in 1796 to support these efforts.31 The General Assembly authorized them to sell 500 acres of Commons; one-half of the proceeds to go to the construction of the courthouse and jail and one-half to the support of the academy.32 In 1819 the commissioners erected a comfortable building for school purposes on the southeastern corner of Reynolds and L streets.33 This was the first public building in Brunswick.34 It was abandoned four years later, but a new building was erected on Hillsborough Square in 1840 using Commons proceeds.35 A courthouse and jail were built around this time.363738 The town was officially incorporated as a city on February 22, 1856.3940 By 1860 Brunswick had a population of 468, a bank, a weekly newspaper, and a sawmill which employed nine workers.41
Brunswick was abandoned during the Civil War when citizens were ordered to evacuate. The city, like many others in the South, suffered from post-war depression. After one of the nation&lt;U+2019&gt;s largest lumber mills began operation on nearby St. Simons Island, economic prosperity returned. Rail lines were constructed from Brunswick to inland Georgia, and, unlike many other southern cities during the Reconstruction period, Brunswick experienced an economic boom.
 In 1878, poet and native Georgian Sidney Lanier, who sought relief from tuberculosis in Brunswick&lt;U+2019&gt;s climate, wrote The Marshes of Glynn, a poem based on the salt marshes that span across Glynn County. The December 1888 issue of Harper's Weekly predicted that &quot;Brunswick by the Sea&quot; was destined to become the &quot;winter Newport of America.&quot; Jekyll Island had become a resort destination for some of the era's most influential families (most notably Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and Goodyears) who arrived by train or yacht.
A yellow fever epidemic began in 1893 which heralded a decade of hardships for the city; it was flooded in 1893 when a modern-day Category 3 hurricane (today known as the Sea Islands Hurricane) paralleled the coast of Georgia before hitting South Carolina. The storm left the city under six feet of water.42 A Category 4 hurricane hit Cumberland Island just south of Brunswick in October 1898,43 which caused a  storm surge in the city.44 As a result, 179 were killed.4546
Construction of an electric streetcar line began in 1909 and was completed in 1911.47 Tracks were located in the center of several city streets. In July 1924, the F.J. Torras Causeway, the roadway between Brunswick and St. Simons Island, was completed,48 and passenger boat service from Brunswick to St. Simons Island was terminated.49 By 1926, the electric streetcar line in Brunswick was discontinued; the decline of the streetcar systems coincided with the rise of the automobile.50
In World War II, Brunswick served as a strategic military location. German U-boats threatened the coast of the southern United States, and blimps became a common sight as they patrolled the coastal areas. During the war, blimps from Brunswick&lt;U+2019&gt;s Naval Air Station Glynco (at the time, the largest blimp base in the world) safely escorted almost 100,000 ships without a single vessel lost to enemy submarines.51
Liberty ships
 In World War II, Brunswick boomed as over 16,000 workers of the J.A. Jones Construction Company produced ninety-nine Liberty ships and &quot;Knot&quot; ships (type C1-M ships which were designed for short coastal runs, and most often named for knots) for the U.S. Maritime Commission to transport materiel to the European and Pacific Theatres.52
The first ship was the SS James M. Wayne (named after James Moore Wayne), whose keel was laid on July 6, 1942 and was launched on March 13, 1943.53 The last ship was the SS Coastal Ranger whose keel was laid on June 7, 1945 and launched on August 25, 1945.54 The first six ships took 305 to 331 days each to complete,55 but soon production ramped up and most of the remaining ships were built in about two months, bringing the average down to 89 days each. By November 1943, about four ships were launched per month. The SS William F. Jerman was completed in only 34 days in November and December 1944.56 Six ships could be under construction in slipways at one time.57
Geography
Topography
 Brunswick is located in the southeastern United States, in southeastern Georgia, approximately halfway between Jacksonville and Savannah. The city is located at the apex of the bight of the Georgia coast, the westernmost point on the Atlantic seaboard, and is naturally sheltered by two barrier islands, Jekyll and St. Simons. The city is situated on a peninsula with the East River and the Turtle River to the west, the Brunswick River to the south,58 and the Intracoastal Waterway to the east. An abundance of salt marshes separate the city from the Intracoastal Waterway, which passes between Brunswick and the barrier islands. The East River separates Brunswick from Andrews Island, a dredge spoil-site.5960
The city is the lowest in the state of Georgia, with an elevation of only 10 feet (3 m) above sea level.6162 Brunswick's land area is estimated at . Its total area is ;  of this is water.
Climate
 Brunswick's climate is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in K&lt;U+00F6&gt;ppen climate classification system).63 During the summer months, it is common for the temperature to reach over 90 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (32 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C). However, the humidity results in a heat index higher than the actual temperature. Summer mornings average nearly 90 percent humidity and nearly 60 percent in the afternoon.64 Scattered afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summer. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Brunswick was 106 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (41 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in 1986.65 Winters in Brunswick are fairly temperate. The average high in January, the coldest month, is 63 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (17 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C), while the average low is 44 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (7 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C).66 Snowfall is very rare. The last snow accumulation in Brunswick was on December 23, 1989.67 The coldest temperature ever recorded in Brunswick was 5 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F (&lt;U+2212&gt;15 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C) in 1985.68
Brunswick receives a high amount of rainfall annually, averaging about 49 inches each year. The wettest months are August and September, the peak of hurricane season.69 The city has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other East Coast cities. A major hurricane has not made landfall on the Georgia coast since 1898,70 and the only hurricane that has hit the coast since then was Hurricane David in 1979.71 However, the city has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions several times due to storms passing through Florida from the Gulf of Mexico and entering Georgia or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing the area.72
Environment
The Brunswick area has four Superfund sites, formerly home to heavily contaminated toxic waste sites.73747576 The Hanlin Group, which maintained a facility to the north of the city called &quot;LCP Chemicals,&quot; was convicted of dumping 150 short tons of mercury into Purvis Creek, a tributary of the Turtle River, and surrounding tidal marshes between the mid-1980s and its closure in 1994.77 The State of Georgia asked the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take immediate action at the site upon its closing.78 The facility was declared a Superfund site; the LCP facility had previously been under scrutiny by the EPA when biologists discovered mercury poisoning in endangered wood storks on St. Simons Island.79 Fish, shellfish, crabs, and shrimp taken in coastal waters as well as other bird species also contained the toxic metal.80 The EPA traced the source of the contamination to the LCP plant and documented the extent of the damage to wildlife resources&lt;U+2014&gt;an effort that resulted in the addition of Endangered Species Act charges to those that would be brought against Hanlin and its officers.81
There are three other Superfund sites in the area: Brunswick Wood Preserving,82 Hercules 009 Landfill,83 and Terry Creek Dredge Spoil Areas/Hercules Outfall.84

On March 25, 1765, Georgia's colonial assembly divided the territory south of the Altamaha River into four new parishes. Two of these parishes&lt;U+2014&gt;St. David and St. Patrick&lt;U+2014&gt;would later be combined to form the mainland portion of Glynn County. Additionally, the 1765 act assigned Jekyll Island to St. James Parish, meaning that this parish consisted entirely of St. Simons and Jekyll islands. On February 5, 1777, the state's first constitution was adopted. Article IV of that document transformed the existing colonial parishes into seven counties, with Native American-ceded lands to the north forming an eighth county. Glynn County, which was seventh on the list and thus is considered Georgia's seventh county, consisted of all of St. David and St. Patrick parishes. In 1789 the legislature added St. Simons and Jekyll islands to Glynn County. Frederica on St. Simons Island served as Glynn County's seat beginning in 1789, at the absorption of the islands into Glynn. In an act of February 10, 1787, Georgia's legislature provided that Glynn County's courthouse and jail be erected and that county elections be held in Brunswick&lt;U+2014&gt;which made it the county seat. Ten years later&lt;U+2014&gt;on February 13, 1797&lt;U+2014&gt;the legislature formally designated Brunswick the seat of Glynn County. (see Glynn County Courthouse at the Digital Library of Georgia).↩
