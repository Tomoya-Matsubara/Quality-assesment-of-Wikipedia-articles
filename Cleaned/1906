Located in Kabul, Afghanistan, the OMAR Mine Museum contains a collection of 51 types of land mines out of the 53 used in Afghanistan over the years. The collection includes unexploded ordnance, cluster bombs and airdrop bombs used by the U.S. invasion in 2002.
OMAR stands for the Organization for Mine Clearance and Afghan Rehabilitation.
For security reasons, the museum is not open for casual visitors. All appointments must be made through the main OMAR office.
Dr. Shah Walie is one of the primary organizers of the museum.
Apart from mines, the museum displays a variety of other military hardware from wars fought in Afghanistan over the recent decades, including artillery, surface-to-air missiles, and a collection of Soviet military aircraft.
