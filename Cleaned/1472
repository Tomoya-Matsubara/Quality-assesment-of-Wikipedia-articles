The Bangor and Carnarvon Railway was a railway connecting Caernarfon railway station (L&amp;NWR)1 (terminus of the Carnarvonshire Railway) from Afon Wen with Bangor2 on the Chester and Holyhead Railway (C&amp;HR).3
History
The railway was incorporated on 20 May 1851. The line opened on 1 March 1852 (for goods) included a branch to Port Dinorwic (Y Felinheli). Passenger services commenced on 1 March 1852, with the C&amp;HR leasing the line for 999 years later in 1852. This arrangement continued until the C&amp;HR received powers to take over the line in 1854, although did not exercise these powers until 15 July 1867.4

Current operations
The line closed entirely on 5 January 1970.
Following the Britannia Bridge fire in 1970, the Menai Bridge to Caernarfon line was temporarily reopened to handle container traffic for Holyhead. This traffic ceased and the line closed again in January 1972.
