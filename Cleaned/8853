 In the North American Numbering Plan, 828 is the telephone area code for the western mountain region of the U.S. state of North Carolina, including Asheville. The city of Hickory is often grouped with the Charlotte metropolitan area, but uses 828 rather than Charlotte's 704/980 area code overlay. 828 was carved from the 704 area code in 1998 to free up numbers because of the popularity of pagers and cell phones.
