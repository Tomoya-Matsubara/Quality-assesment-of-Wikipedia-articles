Artur is a cognate to the common male given name Arthur, meaning &quot;bear-like,&quot; which is believed to possibly be descended from the Roman surname Artorius or the Celtic bear-goddess Artio or more probably from the Celtic word artos (&quot;bear&quot;). Other Celtic languages have similar first names, such as Old Irish Art, Art&lt;U+00FA&gt;ur, Welsh Arth - which may also be the source for the modern name. Art is also a diminutive form of the common name Arthur. In many Slavic, Romance, and Germanic languages the name is spelled as Artur. The Finnish versions are Arttu and Artturi.
