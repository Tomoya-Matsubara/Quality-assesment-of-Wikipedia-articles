The Bundesstra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e 6 (abbr. B 6) runs from the North Sea coast in a southeasterly direction through the states of Lower Saxony, Bremen, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony to the Polish border.
History
 The former Reichsstra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e 6 ran from G&lt;U+00F6&gt;rlitz via Hirschberg and Schweidnitz to Breslau and from there via Oelsas far as the old Polish border near Gro&lt;U+00DF&gt; Wartenberg.
Between Leipzig and G&lt;U+00F6&gt;rlitz the B 6 largely follows (apart from the ring roads around Mei&lt;U+00DF&gt;en, Dresden and Bischofswerda) the historic course of the Via Regia.
In the days of East Germany the section on GDR territory was known as the F 6 (Fernverkehrsstra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e 6 or &quot;trunk road&quot;). In this road lay inside the town area of Dresden the headquarters of VEB Tabakkontor Dresden, a tobacco firm, nowadays known as Yenidze. This led to the urban myth that the road had given its name to the cigarette brand, f6.
As a result of the opening of the A 27 motorway between Cuxhaven and Bremen-Nord (formerly Bremen-Burglesum) in the mid- to late-1970s the B 6 was replaced by the A 27. Until that point the B 6 had linked the two cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven in the state of Bremen and also connected them to Cuxhaven.
The old route in Cuxhaven from the start (Poststra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e/Deichstra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e crossroads), apart from the Rohdestra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e as far as the branch to the motorway slip road at Altenwalde junction ws renamed the B 73. The rest of the route to Bremen, with the exception of a short section in Bremerhaven, was downgraded to Landesstra&lt;U+00DF&gt;e 135.
