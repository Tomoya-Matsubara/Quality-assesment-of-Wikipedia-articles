David Gene Pearson (born December 22, 1934) is a former American stock car racer from Spartanburg, South Carolina.1 Pearson began his NASCAR career in 1960 and ended his first season by winning the 1960 NASCAR Rookie of the Year award.2 He won three championships (1966, 1968, and 1969) in NASCAR's Grand National Series (now Sprint Cup Series).3 NASCAR described his 1974 season as an indication of his &quot;consistent greatness&quot;; that season he finished third in the season points having competed in only 19 of 30 races.4
At his finalist nomination for NASCAR Hall of Fame's inaugural 2010 class, NASCAR described Pearson as &quot;... the model of NASCAR efficiency during his career. With little exaggeration, when Pearson showed up at a race track, he won.&quot;5 Pearson ended his career in 1986, and currently holds the second position on NASCAR's all-time win list with 105 victories; as well as achieving 113 pole positions.6 Pearson was successful in different venues of racing; he won three times on road courses, 48 times on superspeedways, 54 time on short tracks, and had 23 dirt track wins.7 Pearson finished with at least one Top 10 finish in each of his 27 seasons.8 Pearson was nicknamed the &quot;Fox&quot; (and later the &quot;Silver Fox&quot;) for his calculated approach to racing.9 ESPN described him as being a &quot;plain-spoken, humble man, and that added up to very little charisma.&quot;10
Pearson's career paralleled Richard Petty's, the winningest driver in NASCAR history.11 They accounted for 63 first/second place finishes.12 Petty said, &quot;Pearson could beat you on a short track, he could beat you on a superspeedway, he could beat you on a road course, he could beat you on a dirt track. It didn't hurt as bad to lose to Pearson as it did to some of the others, because I knew how good he was.&quot;13
Background
Pearson was born in Whitney, South Carolina, near Spartanburg, in an area known for its moonshine roots.14 When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree at the local stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races.15 Pearson said, &quot;I'd always been interested in cars, and I decided right then that was what I wanted to do with my life.&quot;16 He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach.17 Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod.18 He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over.19 His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build.20 In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race.21 He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including John Littlejohn.22
Career
1960s
Pearson began racing in NASCAR's Grand National series during the 1960 season23 shortly after winning the 1959 track champion at Greenville-Pickens Speedway.24 His first NASCAR start was the first 1960 Daytona 500 qualifying race and he finished 17th in a self-owned car that he had purchased from Jack White.2526 He started 22 events that season, finishing 23rd in season points and was voted the 1960 NASCAR Rookie of the Year.27 His season was highlighted by a second-place finish at Gamecock Speedway in Sumter, South Carolina, and a fourth place finish at Hickory Motor Speedway and fifth after starting on the pole position at his hometown track in Piedmont Interstate Fairgrounds in Spartanburg.28
 When Pearson bent the frame of the his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which included two sons.29 Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and was not able to compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended that car builder Ray Fox hire Pearson.30 Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car to relatively untested 26-year-old driver.31 After Pearson had a successful test run, he qualified the car with the third fastest time behind Richard Petty and Joe Weatherly.32 Pearson raced his way into the lead early in the event and was the leader after the first round of pit stops.33 Pearson and Petty were the only two cars on the lead lap by a restart on the 311th lap (of 400).34 Petty made up six seconds on Pearson in 20 laps before Petty had to retire with a blown engine.35 Pearson held a three lap lead over Fireball Roberts and was leading late in the race until he ran over some debris on the backstretch and blew a tire with only two laps remaining.36 Pearson drove the car around the track slowly for the final lap at approximately  to take the victory.37 He started in 19 races during the 1961 season and he had three wins to finish thirteenth in season points,38 winning his first NASCAR race in a Fox-prepared car at Concord Speedway.39 Later in the season, he won the Firecracker 250 at Daytona and the Dixie 400 at Atlanta.40
Pearson started in only 12 of 53 events in 1962 yet managed to finish tenth in season points.41 Pearson began the season racing for Fox until Fox retired;42 he started for Petty Enterprises, Cotton Owens, and Bud Moore that season.43 He had seven top ten finishes and no wins.44 During 41 starts in 55 races, Pearson finished the 1963 season sixth in points for Cotton Owens.45 He held two pole positions and had no wins.4647 In 1964, he had eight wins at Richmond, Greenville-Pickens Speedway, Occoneechee Speedway, Boyd Speedway, Lincoln Speedway, Rambi Raceway (now Myrtle Beach Speedway), Columbia Speedway, and Hickory Motor Speedway.48 Pearson finished third in the championship, which was won by Petty for the first time.49 He qualified on the pole position for 12 events.50
NASCAR banned the Mopar Hemi engine in 1965, so Petty and Pearson boycotted many races rather than compete with a non-competitive engine against Ford and Mercury drivers.51 Both competed in drag racing. Pearson drove a Dodge Dart station wagon nicknamed the &quot;Cotton Picker&quot; for Owens.52 NASCAR owner Bill France, Sr. adjusted the engine rules later in the season to bring back Mopar drivers; Petty and Pearson ended up competing in 14 of 55 events.53 Pearson won two of the final 21 races (Columbia and Richmond) to finish 40th in the season points.54
Pearson won his the first of his three NASCAR championships in 1966.55 He won 15 of 49 events, which was the second most in NASCAR history at that time.56 Early in the season, Pearson won at Hickory, Columbia, Greenville-Pickens, and Winston-Salem Speedway to complete four straight victories.5758 Throughout the season, Pearson won at Richmond, Dog Track Speedway (Moyock, North Carolina), New Asheville Speedway, Smokey Mountain Raceway, the second Greenville-Pickens race, Bridgehampton Raceway, Fonda Speedway, Columbia, Bowman Gray Stadium, Hickory, and the second Richmond race.59
Pearson ran a partial season in 1967, competing in 22 of 48 races.60 He began the season racing for Cotton Owens before switching after the thirteenth race to Holman Moody.61 Pearson quit after there was a misunderstanding about who would drive the teams tow truck.62 Dodge decided to stop racing in NASCAR, so Pearson switched way from Owen's Dodges in favor of Holman Moody's Fords.63 He had two wins (Bristol, Greenville-Pickens), both for Owens, in a season that was dominated by Petty's all-time record 27 victories (including all-time record 10 straight).6465 Pearson finished seventh in season points.66
Petty and Pearson each won 16 races during 1968; Pearson won the championship and Petty finished third.67 Pearson complete primarily for Holman-Moody, winning at Bristol, Richmond, North Wilkesboro, Asheville-Weaverville Speedway, Darlington, Beltsville Speedway, Langley Field Speedway, Charlotte, Middle Georgia Raceway, Bristol, Nashville Speedway, Columbia, Bowman-Gray, Asheville-Weaverville, Langley Field, Hickory, and Augusta Speedway.68 He added twelve pole positions.69
Pearson won his third and final championship in 1969.70 The championship tied Pearson with Lee Petty for the most championships in NASCAR history (Richard Petty holds the current record with seven titles).71 He started out the season at the 1969 Daytona 500 by being the first driver to qualify faster than 190 miles per hour with a speed of .7273 After winning the first Daytona 500 Qualifying race, Pearson led the 500 under caution with 13 laps remaining and changed only his right side tires in a two-tire pit stop. Pete Hamilton did a four-tire stop and passed Pearson after the restart for the victory.74 In 51 starts, he had 11 wins, 42 top-fives, and 44 top-tens.75 He earned a record $229,760 for his effort.76 Pearson completed 14,270 laps in 1969, which is the most laps ever in a NASCAR Cup season.77 He was one of eleven drivers to boycott the first race at Talladega after concerns with the tires; he rejoined the tour at the following event.78
1970s
 The 1970 season started with Pearson competing part-time, like he would for the rest of his career. In 19 starts, he won a single race (Darlington) and earned two pole positions (Bristol, Darlington) to finished 23rd in points.79
R. J. Reynolds began sponsoring NASCAR in 1971 and the Grand National series was retitled the Winston Cup Series.80 Holman Moody and Pearson split near the middle of the season after Pearson refused to take a 10% pay cut .81 He won two races before the split (Daytona Twin 125 and Bristol) plus four second place finishes.82 Pearson finished out the season by competing in seven races for Ray Nichels.83 He recorded one top-ten finish (eighth at the July Daytona race), but suffered mechanical problems in all of the other races.84 For the season he finished 51st in points after competing in 17 races with nine top-tens and eight top-fives.85
At R. J. Reynolds' request, NASCAR began cutting down on the number of races in 1972 season by eliminating midweek races.86 It also dropped 13 short tracks and had a 31-race schedule.8788 Pearson began racing for the Wood Brothers that season.89 He raced in 17 of the events and had six wins, which earned him a 20th place finish in the season points.90 Pearson was racing against Bobby Isaac and Buddy Baker at the end of the Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway when Jimmy Crawford spun into Isaac; Pearson won the race.91 He won later that season at the Firecracker 400, a race that he would win three straight times.92
While Pearson only started in 18 (of 28) races during 1973, he was named the NASCAR driver of the Year after finishing eighth in points.9394 He won 11 of those 18 races in the Wood Brothers Mercury.95 His 61% win percentage is the highest in NASCAR history.96 He had wins at North Carolina Motor Speedway (Rockingham), Atlanta, Darlington, Martinsville, Talladega, Dover, Michigan, second Daytona race, second Atlanta race, second Dover race, and the second Rockingham race.97 The remaining seven races contained four Did Not Finishes (DNFs), two second-place finishes and one third place.98 At the first Rockingham event, Pearson led 499 of 500 miles, giving up the lead only for a pit stop.99 He won eight pole positions with a 3.4 average starting position.100
Pearson finished third in the 1974 points after competing in 19 of 30 events.101 It was the only season where drivers were awarded points based on their money earnings, which ended up rewarding drivers who finished high in the big-money races.102 He won seven races, including the Winston 500 by 0.17 seconds over Benny Parsons.103 Pearson earned some of his &quot;outfox&quot; nickname at the 1974 Firecracker 400. Entering the final lap, he was leading followed closely by Petty. Fearing that Petty to do a slingshot pass, he slowed a little, pulled his car off to the side to simulate a blown motor, and threw his hand up in the air as a motion of defeat. Petty quickly passed, only to find Pearson following him closely. Coming out of the final corner, Pearson did a slingshot pass back to win the race.104 The International Race of Champions (IROC) invited him to participate in their first annual all-star stock car racing series for the 1973/74 season and he finished fourth of the twelve drivers.105
In 1975, NASCAR changed to the points system that it would use for over a decade until the current Chase for the Cup format was implemented.106 ABC televised the second half of the 1975 Daytona 500 and drew a 10.5 rating opposite a 8.6 rating for an NBA game and a 4.1 for a NHL game.107 Pearson led the race with three laps remaining. Benny Parsons was racing in a distant second. Petty, who was several laps down after experiencing tires difficulties, began drafting with Parsons and the duo started closing on Pearson. Pearson collided with another car and Parsons won the race. After the race, Pearson complained that Petty showed favoritism by helping Parsons.108 Pearson's attempt to win his third consecutive Winston 500 fell short when he was unable to catch Baker.109 Despite these near wins, he was able to win three times in 21 attempts.110 He finished 14th in points in the 30–event season.111 He competed in the second annual IROC season during 1974/75 and he finished sixth in points.112  The 1976 Daytona 500 is know for the final lap battle between Pearson and Petty.113 In 2007, ESPN rated the race as the fourth most interesting Daytona 500.114 Petty passed Pearson for the lead at the beginning of the final lap.115 Pearson used the draft to attempt a slingshot pass against Petty at the end of the back stretch,116 but his car pushed high into the final turn while going around another car. Petty edged under Pearson, and their cars crashed into each other on the frontstretch in the final turns.117 They both spun out into the infield grass approximately 100 feet (30 meters) short of the finish line.118 The third place car was over a lap behind the disabled cars.119 With Petty unable to restart his car, Pearson slowly drove his Wood Brothers Mercury over the grassy infield past the finish line for his only Daytona 500 victory.120121 He won a series-best ten races in 1976, but finished ninth in season points after competing in only 22 of 30 events.122 He won his only IROC race at the first race of IROC III in 1975/1976 at Michigan International Speedway and finished fifth in points.123
Pearson finished 13th in the 1977 NASCAR points, with two wins in 22 (of 30) races.124 IROC invited him to participate in IROC IV in 1976/77 and he finished ninth in the four race series.125
He competed in 22 races (of 30) again in 1978, winning four times for a 16th place finish in the season points.126 In March, Pearson won his 100th Winston Cup race at Rockingham.127 Late in the World 600, Pearson was battling for the win against Parsons until Parsons' spin collected both drivers. Darrell Waltrip edged Donnie Allison for the victory.128 Pearson competed in his final IROC race in June 1978 during IROC V.129
Pearson began 1979 by winning the pole position at year's first race at Riverside; he finished the final NASCAR race at the track in second place.130 1979 was Pearson's final season racing for the Wood Brothers,131 with his last race happening at Darlington.132 After a miscommunication, he left the pits without waiting for the pit crew to place lugnuts on the car and the tires fell off the car when he reached the end of pit lane.133 Pearson quit the team after the race.134 Pearson had won 43 races between 1972 and 79 while driving for the Wood Brothers.135 Later during the season, Rod Osterlund's rookie driver, Dale Earnhardt, suffered a shoulder injury.136 Osterlund hired Pearson to replace Earnhardt during four races; he collected the pole position at Michigan and won the 1979 Southern 500.137138 For the season, Pearson had competed in nine races and finished 32nd in points.139 Fans voted him as NASCAR's Most Popular Driver.140
