Old Chapel, formerly known as the Old Chapel Library, is a landmark on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Constructed in 1884 at a cost of $25,0001 to serve as a library, museum, and assembly hall, the Richardson Romanesque style building, constructed by Stephen C. Earle, has over the years been home to numerous academic departments and, most recently, the UMass Marching Band.2 The Chapel's original bell, &quot;Old Aggie,&quot; was added in 1892, since replaced by 44 Carillon bells.3 Although the tower underwent a $1.65 million renovation in 1999, the Old Chapel has been uninhabited since 1996; a movement among alumni exists to further renovate the interior of the building, allowing the Old Chapel to again be used as a center for campus life.4
John F. Kennedy spoke at the Chapel during his 1952 U.S. Senate campaign.5
