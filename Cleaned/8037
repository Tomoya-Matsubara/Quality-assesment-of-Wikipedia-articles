Goodison Park is a football stadium located in Walton, Liverpool, England. The stadium has been home to Everton F.C. since its completion in 1892 and is one of the world's first purpose-built football grounds. The stadium is built in a residential area served by regular rail and bus services two miles from Liverpool city centre.
Goodison has undergone many changes over the years and it presently has an all-seated capacity of 40,157. Everton fans refer to the stadium as &quot;The Grand Old Lady&quot; and the abridged &quot;Goodison&quot;. It has hosted more top-flight games than any other stadium in England and has hosted the maximum possible number of Premier League games as Everton have never been relegated from the Premier League.
As well as hosting Everton games, the stadium has been the venue for an FA Cup Final and numerous international fixtures, including several in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The record for the highest attendance in women's football was set at Goodison Park in 1920. This game's high attendance resulted in women's football being banned by the Football Association for 50 years as they felt it threatened the men's game.
Goodison Park was conceived in unusual circumstances: two factions of politicians on the Everton board wanted to control the destiny of the club. Ultimately it was a tool devised by local Liberal politicians to gain voter's support. Everton F.C.'s relocation to Goodison Park was one of the earliest cases of a team moving to a new stadium for monetary benefit.
History
Before Goodison Park
Everton originally played on an open pitch in the southeast corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park. This is the site for the proposed new Liverpool F.C. stadium. The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road which became the club's home for two years, with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave his land as the crowds became far too large and noisy.1
Everton moved to nearby Anfield, where proper covered stands were built. Everton played at Anfield from 1884 until 1892.2 During this time the club turned professional and entered teams in the FA Cup.3 They became founding members of the Football League and won their first championship at the ground in 1890&lt;U+2013&gt;91.4 Anfield's capacity grew to over 20,000 and the club hosted an international match between England and Ireland. Everton were the first team to introduce the goalnet to professional football at Anfield.5
In the 1890s, a dispute about how the club was to be owned and run emerged with John Houlding, Anfield's majority owner and Everton's Chairman, at the forefront.6 Houlding and the club's committee initially disagreed about the full purchase of the land at Anfield from minor land owner Mr Orrell and escalated into a principled disagreement of how the club was run. This caused Everton to leave Anfield and Houlding to form Liverpool F.C. to play at the newly vacant ground.7
Birth of Goodison Park
On 15 September 1891, a General Meeting took place at Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley. John Houlding proposed that a limited liability company be formed and that the company should purchase his land and local brewer Joseph Orrel's land for &lt;U+00A3&gt;9,237. This was most unusual for the time as football clubs were seen to be run under the guise of &lt;U+201C&gt;Sports Clubs&lt;U+201D&gt; with members paying an annual fee. The proposal was supported by William Barclay, the club secretary and a close friend of Houlding.8
 Liberal Party politician and Everton board member George Mahon fought the proposal and put forward his own amendment which was carried by the Everton board. At the time Everton's board contained both Conservative and Liberal Party councillors. Houlding and Mahon had previously clashed during local elections.910
Both men agreed that Everton should operate as a limited liability company however they had different ideas about share ownership. Houlding suggested that 12,000 shares be created and each Everton board member be given one share each and the rest were to be sold to those who could afford it including Everton board members. Mahon disagreed and he put forward his proposal that would see 500 shares created, with no member carrying more than 10 shares and board members being given &quot;7 or 8&quot; shares. Mahon reasoned &quot;we would rather have a large number of individual applications so that there will be more supporters of the club&quot;.11
A special general meeting was convened at the former Liverpool College building on Shaw Street on 25 January 1982. John Houlding's proposal was defeated once more and George Mahon suggested that Everton relocate to another site. A heckler shouted &quot;You can't find one&quot;, Mahon responded &quot;I have one in my pocket&quot; and he revealed an option to lease Mere Green field, in Walton, Lancashire, the site of what is today known as Goodison Park.12
The Liverpool press were largely partisan, the proposal was deemed to be a positive move for the club by the Liberal leaning Liverpool Daily Post who described Houlding's ousting as &quot;having shaken off the incubus&quot;13 whereas the Tory-supporting Liverpool Courier and Liverpool Evening Express owned by Conservative MP for Everton John A.Willox, a Trustee of the Licensed Victuallers&lt;U+2019&gt; and Brewers&lt;U+2019&gt; Association took Houlding's side. The Courier published letters regularly criticising Mahon's supporters &lt;U+2014&gt; many of which were anonymous.14
The name Goodison Park was given to the stadium because the length of it was built against Goodison Road. The road was named after a civil engineer called George Goodison who provided a sewage report to the Walton Local Board in the mid 1800s and later became a local land owner.15
The Mere Green field was owned by Christopher Leyland and Everton rented it until they were in a position to buy it outright. It was not without problems and parts of the site had to be excavated, the field was levelled, a drainage system was installed and turf was laid. This work was considered to be a 'formidable initial expenditure' and a local contractor Mr Barton was contracted to work on the  site at 4&lt;U+00BD&gt;d per square yard &lt;U+2014&gt; a total cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;552. A J. Prescott was brought in as an architectural advisor and surveyor.16
Walton based building firm Kelly brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators. A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested. The combined cost of these stands was &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,640 and Everton had inserted a penalty clause into the contract for if the building work were to miss its 31 July deadline.17 Everton officials were impressed with the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts; exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;150 and 12 turnstiles were installed at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;7 each.18 In 1894, Benjamin Kelly of Kelly Brothers was appointed as a director of Everton.19
Dr. James Baxter of the Everton committee donated a &lt;U+00A3&gt;1,000 interest-free loan for the building of Goodison Park. The stadium was England's first purpose-built football ground, with stands on three sides. Goodison Park was officially opened on the 24th August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association. No football was played. Instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short athletics meeting followed by music and a fireworks display.20 Upon its completion the stadium was the first purpose built football stadium in England, and was only preceded in the United Kingdom by the Scottish club ' Ibrox Stadium, inaugurated in 1887. Celtic's Parkhead ground was inaugurated on the same day as Goodison. 21
The first match at Goodison Park was on 2 September 1892 between Everton and , Everton wearing new club colours of salmon and dark blue stripes. Everton won the game 4&lt;U+2013&gt;2.22 The first league game at Goodison Park took place on 3 September 1892 against Nottingham Forest. The game ended in a 2&lt;U+2013&gt;2 draw, the stadium's first competitive goal was scored by Forest&lt;U+2019&gt;s Horace Pike, with the first Everton goal coming from Fred Geary. Everton's first league victory at their new ground came in the next home game with a 6&lt;U+2013&gt;0 defeat of Newton Heath.
It was announced at a general meeting on 22 March 1895 that the club could finally afford to buy Goodison Park. Mahon revealed that Everton were buying Goodison Park for &lt;U+00A3&gt;650 less than Anfield was offered to them three years previously and Goodison Park had more land and had 25% larger capacity. The motion to purchase Goodison Park was passed unanimously.23 Dr. Baxter also lent the club &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000 to pay the mortgage early at a rate of 3&lt;U+00BD&gt;%.24 By this time the redrawing of political boundaries meant that Walton, and hence Goodison Park, were within the City of Liverpool.25
The Independent newspaper journalist David Conn unexpectedly coined the nickname &quot;The Grand Old Lady&quot; for the stadium in 1999 when he wrote &quot;Another potential suitor has apparently thought better of Everton, walking away on Tuesday from the sagging Grand Old Lady of English football, leaving her still in desperate need of a makeover.&quot;26

Structural developments
Behind the goal, at the South end of the ground, the Goodison Avenue Stand was built in 1906. It was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley27 who went on to Chair the Liverpool Architectural Society a year later.28 The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of he stand and the poor sightlines meant that the goal line had to be moved 7 metres North, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and the bill for the stand was near &lt;U+00A3&gt;13,000.29 There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with a terrace below.
The Goodison Road Stand was constructed in 1909. In September that year Ernest Edwards, the Liverpool Echo journalist who christened the terrace at Anfield the &quot;Spion Kop&quot;, wrote of the newly built stand, &quot;The building as one looks at it, suggests the side of Mauretania at once&quot;.30 The stand was occasionally referred to as the &quot;Mauretania Stand&quot;, in reference to the Liverpool registered RMS Mauretania, then the world's largest ship, which had recently docked in the Port of Liverpool.31
The two-tier steel frame and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, designed by Archibald Leitch, was completed in 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, a part of the ground called The Paddock. The original Bullens Road Stand was replaced by a new one in 1895 with the open Goodison Road side covered, giving cover on all four sides of the ground. Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as handrails for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.32
Everton constructed covered dugouts in 1931. The idea was inspired by a visit to Pittodrie to play a friendly against Aberdeen, where such dugouts had been constructed at the behest of the Dons' trainer Donald Coleman. The Goodison Park dugouts were the first in England.33
 The ground become an entirely two-tiered affair in 1938 when the Gwladys Street Stand was completed at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000.3435 Architect Leitch and Eveton Chairman Will Cuff became so close over the years that Cuff was appointed as Leitch's accountant and Leitch moved to nearby Formby.36
In 1940, during the Second World War, the Gwladys Street Stand suffered bomb damage. The bomb had landed directly in Gwladys Street and caused serious injury to nearby residents. The bomb splinter damage to the bricks on the stand is still noticeable. The cost of repair was &lt;U+00A3&gt;5,000 and was paid for by the War Damage Commission.37
The Director's minutes read: &quot;It was decided also that Messrs A. Leitch be instructed to value the cost of complete renewal of damaged properties and that a claim should be forwarded to the War Damage Claims department within the prescribed 30 days.
&quot;The damage referred to included the demolition of a wide section of the new stand outer wall in Gwladys St, destruction of all glass in this stand, damage to every door, canteen, water and electricity pipe and all lead fittings: perforate roof in hundreds of places.
&quot;On Bullens Road side, a bomb dropped in the school yard had badly damaged the exterior wall of this stand and the roof was badly perforated here also. A third bomb outside the practice ground had demolished the surrounding hoarding and had badly damaged glass in the Goodison Ave and Walton Lane property.&quot;38
The first undersoil heating system in English football was installed at Goodison Park in 1958, with 20 miles of electric wire laid beneath the playing surface at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;16,000. The system was more effective than anticipated and the drainage system could not cope with the quantity of water produced from the melting of frost and snow. As a consequence the pitch had to be relaid in 1960 to allow a more suitable drainage system to be installed.39
The Everton chairman Sir John Moores who presided over the club between 1960 and 1973 provided finances for the club in the form of loans to become involved in large-scale redevelopment projects and compete with other clubs for the best players, for a period of time under his stewardship Everton were known as 'The Mersey Millionaires'.40
Goodison Park featured in the filming of The Golden Vision, a BBC film made for television. The matches featured in the film were Division One games against Manchester City on 4 November 1967 (1&lt;U+2013&gt;1 draw) and 18 November 1967 versus Sheffield United (1&lt;U+2013&gt;0 win) &lt;U+2014&gt; the scorer of the winner that day was Alex Young, also known as The Golden Vision or Golden Ghost after whom the film was named.
A scoreboard was first introduced on 20 November 1971. Everton beat Southampton 8&lt;U+2013&gt;0 with Joe Royle scoring four, David Johnson three and Alan Ball one. The scoreboard did not have enough room to display the goal scorer's names and simply read &quot;7 9 7 9 8 9 9 7&quot; as it displayed the goal scorers' shirt numbers instead.41
The Goodison Road Main Stand was partially demolished and rebuilt during the 1969&lt;U+2013&gt;70 season with striking images of both old and new stands side by side. The new Main Stand opened 1971, at a cost of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1 million. The new stand housed the 500 and 300 members clubs42 and an escalator to the tallest stand in the ground &lt;U+2014&gt; the Top Balcony.43 However, not everyone thought that the upgrade was necessary at the time. Journalist Geoffrey Green of The Times wrote &quot;Goodison Park has always been a handsome fashionable stage for football, a living thing full of atmospherics-like a theatre. And now it has stepped into the demanding seventies with a facelift it scarcely seemed to need compared with some of us I know. New giant stands in place of the old; the latest in dazzling floodlight systems that cast not a shadow. A cathedral of a place indeed, fit for the gods of the game.&quot;44
The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 saw the Bullens Road Stand extensively fireproofed with widened aisles, which entailed closure of parts of the stand.45 Because of the closure, Anfield was chosen over first choice Goodison Park for a Wales vs. Scotland World Cup qualifying tie.46
Following Moores' exit from Everton's hierarchy, minimum changes have been made to Goodison Park's structure due to costs,47 two British Government Acts; the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Football Spectators Act 1989 have forced the club's hand into improving the facilities. Upon Moore's death the club was sold to Peter Johnson.48
Everton legends William Ralph 'Dixie' Dean and former manager Harry Catterick both died at Goodison Park. Dean suffered from a heart attacked aged 73 in 1980 whilst Catterick died five years later also suffering a heart attack aged 65.
Everton F.C. celebrated the centenary of Goodison Park with a game against German club side Borussia Monchengladbach in August 1992.49 In addition, 200 limited edition medals were created50 and Liverpool based author and journalist Ken Rogers wrote a book &quot;One Hundred Years Of Goodison Glory&quot; to commemorate the occasion.
Post-Taylor Report
Following the publication of the 1990 Taylor Report, in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster, top-flight English football grounds had to become all-seated.51 At the time three of the four sides of the ground had standing areas. The Enclosure, fronting the main stand, had already been made all-seated in time for the 1987&lt;U+2013&gt;88 season and was given the new name of Family Enclosure. The Paddock, the Park End terrace and the Gwladys Street terrace, known as 'the Ground', were standing and had to be replaced. The Everton match versus Luton Town in May 1991 was the final time that Gwladys Street allowed standing spectators, 'crash barriers' (a blockade to prevent fans running onto the pitch) were also removed from the front of the stand.52 Seats were installed in the Paddock, while the Lower Gwladys Street was later completely rebuilt to accommodate seating with new concrete steps.
Everton opted to demolish the entire Park End stand in 1994 and replace it with a single-tier cantilever stand, with the assistance of a grant of &lt;U+00A3&gt;1.3 million from the Football Trust.53
Current structure
 Goodison Park has a total capacity of 40,157 all-seated and comprises four separate stands: the Main Stand, Gwladys Street Stand, Bullens Road, and the Stanley Park End.54
Main Stand
The Main Stand is a triple-decker stand with each deck-level given a seperate name. The middle-deck level is also known as the Main Stand section and is fronted by another seated section known as the Family Enclosure. The Enclosure was originally terracing prior to the advent of all-seater stadia. The Top Balcony is the highest part of the stadium. The stand became all seated in 1987 and now has a capacity of 12,664.55
The Main Stand is also home to the conference and hospitality facilities. On non-match days Goodison Park holds conferences, weddings, meetings and parties on a daily basis.
Bullens Road
 On the East side of the ground, the Bullens Road stand is divided into the Upper Bullens, Lower Bullens and The Paddock. The rear of the south end of the stand houses away supporters. The north corner of the stand is connected to the Gwladys Street Stand. The current capacity of the stand is 10,784.56 The stand takes its name from the adjacent Bullens Road. The Upper Bullens is decorated with Archibald Leitch's distinctive truss design.57
Gwladys Street Stand
Behind the goal at the North end of Goodison Park, the Gwladys Street Stand is divided into Upper Gwladys and Lower Gwladys. This stand is the &quot;Popular End&quot;, holding the most boisterous and vociferous home supporters. It is known colloquially as &quot;The Street End&quot;. If Everton win the toss before kick-off the captain traditionally elects to play towards the Gwladys Street End in the second half. The stand has a capacity of 10,78858 and gives its name to Gwladys Street&lt;U+2019&gt;s Hall of Fame.
The Park End
 At the south end of the ground, behind one goal, the Park Stand backs onto Walton Lane which borders Stanley Park. The name of the stand was originally the Stanley Park End but it's commonly referred to as the Park End. The single tiered stand broke from the multi-tiered tradition of Goodison Park. The Park End has the smallest capacity at Goodison Park. The current layout of the stand was opened on 17 September 1994 with a capacity of 5,922.59 It was opened by David Hunt, a Member of Parliament.60 During the structure's development, fans were able to watch matches by climbing trees in neighbouring Stanley Park. 61
In the late 1970s and 1980s the stand accommodated the away fans. Previously it was open to home supporters. The lower tier of the old stand was terracing and this was closed off by the turn of the 1980s due to it being a fire hazard as the terracing steps were wooden. The front concrete terracing remained and was one of the last standing areas at a Premiership ground. During the 1960s and 1970s, both ends of the ground featured a large semicircle behind the goals.
The area around Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built right in to the stand itself (as shown on old photographs of Goodison and in programmes). The club had previously owned many of the houses on the road and rented them to players. One of the players to live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.62 By the 1990s the club had demolished virtually the whole street and this coincided with the redevelopment of the Park End stand. However at present the majority of the land is now an open car park for the club and its Marquee.
St Luke's Church
Sketch published by Outdoors Magazine in 1892, St. Luke's predecessor &lt;U+2013&gt; a wooden church structure can be seen behind the corner of the pitch.
Goodison Park is unique in the sense that a church, St Luke's, protrudes into the site between the Main Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church.63 The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.64
The church can be seen from the Park End and Bullens Road and has featured prominently over the years as a backdrop during live televised matches. It is also the home to the Everton Former Players' Foundation of which the Reverend is a trustee.65
Everton once tried to pay for its removal in order to gain extra space for a larger capacity.66 In more recent years, a large 'jumbrotron' screen has been installed between the Main Stand and Gwladys Street partially obscuring the church from view. Before the all-seating regulations were introduced some fans would climb up and watch a football game from the church rooftop.
The future
  Since the late 1990s the board of Everton have been seeking a new, alternative stadium to replace Goodison Park. Plans for a possible relocation were first mentioned in 1996, when then chairman Peter Johnson announced his intention to build a new 60,000-seat stadium for the club. At the time, no English league club had a stadium with such a high capacity.67
In 2001, plans were drawn up to move to a 55,000-seat purpose-built arena on the site of the Kings Dock in Liverpool, but the plans never came to fruition as the club could not raise sufficient funds.68 Following this, plans were made to move to Kirkby, just outside the city, in a joint venture with the supermarket chain Tesco. The scheme was greatly divisive amongst supporters and local authorities, but was rejected in late November 2009 following a decision by Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.
The site of Goodison Park was earmarked in 2003 for a food store by Tesco, who offered &lt;U+00A3&gt;12 million for the site valued at &lt;U+00A3&gt;4m.69 The club were advised that the planning permission required would not necessarily be granted, and chose not to take the scheme further.70
Supporters' groups have fought against the club moving to a new stadium twice. In 1996 a group called Goodison For Ever-ton successfully fought against the club moving to a new stadium.71 In 2007 another group was established called Keep Everton In Our City (KEIOC) who attempted to prevent the club moving to a new stadium in Kirkby.72 The supporters' groups have argued that it is possible to expand Goodison Park, despite it being surrounded by housing and local authority buildings, and have produced image renders, architectural drawings and costings for a redeveloped Goodison Park.73 Liverpool City Council leader Warren Bradley stated that a redevelopment of Goodison Park was his favoured option, and that relocation of the homes, infrastructure and businesses in streets adjoining the ground is &quot;not a major hurdle&quot;.74
Everton's current position regarding the future of Goodison Park is that they are considering all options, including relocation, redevelopment of the current ground, or a groundshare with Liverpool F.C., in a new, purpose-built stadium in Stanley Park, stressing that finance is the main factor affecting decision-making.75
In 2010 Everton supporters approached University of Liverpool and Liverpool City Council to initiate a dedicated 'Football Quarter'/'Sports City' zone around Goodison Park, Stanley Park and Anfield. The University and City Council met with the North West Development Agency, Everton and Liverpool F.C. representatives but no further action has been taken.76
Transportation
Goodison Park is located two miles north of Liverpool City Centre. Liverpool Lime Street railway station is the nearest mainline station. The nearest station to the stadium is Kirkdale railway station on the Merseyrail Northern Line which is located just over half a mile away. On match days there is also a frequent shuttle bus service from Sandhills railway station known as &quot;SoccerBus&quot;. In 2007 Sandhills underwent a &lt;U+00A3&gt;6million renovation to help encourage people to use the rail service.77
Walton and Anfield railway station located on Walton Lane &lt;U+2014&gt; the same road that the Park End backs onto &lt;U+2014&gt; was the nearest station to Goodison Park until its closure in 1948.78 It is possible that the station could be re-opened should the Canada Dock Branch line be re-opened to the public following the construction of Stanley Park railway station.79
There are on-site parking facilities for supporters and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits. The Car Parking resident parking scheme is operated by Liverpool City Council.80
Records
Everton has staged more top-flight football games than any other club in England with Aston Villa having the second highest figure with eight less. Everton have played at Goodison Park for all but 4 of their 106 league seasons therefore Goodison Park has hosted more top-flight games than any other in England.81 Goodison is the only English club ground to have hosted a FIFA World Cup semi final.
Everton won 15 home league games in a row between 4 October 1930 and 4 April 1931.82 In the 1931&lt;U+2013&gt;32 season Goodison Park was the venue of the most goals scored at home in a league season, 84 by Everton.83 Between 23 April 1984 and 2 September 1986 Everton scored consecutively in 47 games.84
Between 23 April 1984 and 2 September 1986 Everton scored in 47 consecutive games at Goodison Park registering 36 wins and 7 draws, scoring 123 goals in the process while conceding 38. Scottish striker Graeme Sharp scored 32 of these goals.85 Until the expansion of Old Trafford in 1996 Goodison Park held the record Sunday attendance on a Football League ground (53,509 v West Bromwich Albion, FA Cup, 1974).
The most goals scored in a game at Goodison Park is 12, this has happened in two Everton games; versus Sheffield Wednesday (9&lt;U+2013&gt;3) on 17 October 1931 and versus Plymouth Argyle (8&lt;U+2013&gt;4) on 27 February 1954.86
Attendances
Whilst at Goodison Park the club has had one of the highest average attendances in the country. The stadium has only had six seasons where Everton FC has not been amongst the top ten highest attendances in the country.87
The highest average attendance in the club's history has been 51,603 (1962&lt;U+2013&gt;63) and the lowest was 13,230 (1892&lt;U+2013&gt;93) which was recorded in Goodison Park's first year.88

Other uses
Despite being purposefully built for Everton F.C. to play football,91 Goodison Park has hosted many other types of events.
Goodison Park as host stadium for football
Goodison Park became the first Football League ground to hold an FA Cup Final, in 1894. Notts County beat Bolton Wanderers, watched by crowd of 37,000. An FA Cup final replay was staged in 1910 with Newcastle United beating Barnsley 2&lt;U+2013&gt;0.
On 26 December 1920, Goodison Park hosted a match between; Dick, Kerr's Ladies &amp; St Helens Ladies. An estimated 53,000 attended the match,92 at a time when the average gate at Goodison Park in 1919&lt;U+2013&gt;20 was near 29,000.93 Dick, Kerr's Ladies won 4&lt;U+2013&gt;0. More than &lt;U+00A3&gt;3,000 was raised for charity. Shortly after, the Football Association banned women's football. The reasons given by the F.A. were not substantial and it is perceived by some that the women's teams were a threat to the men's game.94 The ban was lifted in 1970.95
During the war, Goodison Park was chosen as a host venue for the &quot;Football League &lt;U+2013&gt; Northern Section&quot; and frequently hosted Territorial Army drill sessions.96
In 1949, Goodison Park became the site of England's first ever defeat on English soil by a non-Home Nations country, namely the Republic of Ireland. The ground hosted five matches including a semi-final for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. In April 1895 Goodison Park hosted England versus Scotland97 and so Everton became the first club to host England internationals on two grounds (the other being Anfield in 1889 when England won 6&lt;U+2013&gt;2 versus Ireland98). The city of Liverpool also became the first English city to stage England games at three different venues, the other being Aigburth Cricket Club.
