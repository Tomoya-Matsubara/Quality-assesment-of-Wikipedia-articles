William A. Donohue (born July 18, 1947 in Manhattan, New York), has been the president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights in the United States since 1993. It claims to be the largest Catholic civil rights organization in the United States. He is known for his public statements on matters that the Catholic League believes relate to the defamation of and the civil rights of Catholics in particular and Christians in general.
Biography
William A. Donohue began his teaching career in the 1970s working at St. Lucy's School in Spanish Harlem. In 1977, he took a position as a college professor teaching at La Roche College in McCandless, Pennsylvania. In 1980 he received a doctorate in Sociology from New York University (NYU).1
His first book was The Politics of the American Civil Liberties Union and he became associated with the conservative Heritage Foundation where he is an adjunct scholar. His books on the ACLU made him one of the group's most prominent critics and firebrands.
While Donohue was in college in New York, Virgil C. Blum, a Jesuit at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, founded the Catholic League to counter Anti-Catholicism in American culture. Blum died in 1990; in 1993, Dr. Donohue became the director of the organization. Under his direction, the organization has become far more prominent and vocal.
Donohue publishes The Catalyst, the Catholic League journal. He serves on the board of directors of the National Association of Scholars. He serves on the board of advisers of the Washington Legal Foundation, the Howard Center for Family, Religion &amp; Society, Society of Catholic Social Scientists, Catholics United for the Faith, Ave Maria Institute, the Christian Film &amp; Television Commission and Catholic War Veterans. He has received several awards from the Catholic community and was voted one of the top 100 Catholics of the 20th century in a survey of Catholics conducted by the internet site, Daily Catholic. He received the 2005 St. Thomas More Award for Catholic Citizenship from Catholic Citizens of Illinois.
The Catholic League is registered as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization. In 2006, according to its Form 990, its revenue was $16,590,333, and Donohue's salary and benefits amounted to $343,420.2
Activities
William Donohue has made a name for himself fighting what he perceives as discrimination against and defamation of Catholics and Catholicism. In doing so he has gone after a diverse array of public figures, from individuals such as Christopher Hitchens, and even businesses such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Miller Brewing Company, to institutions such as Bob Jones University.
In addition, Donohue has criticized political and social commentator Bill Maher, 3456789, controversial singer, songwriter, and comedian Jessica Delfino, 1011 comedian Louis CK, 12 singers Joan Osborne 13141516 and Marilyn Manson, 17 the television shows Nothing Sacred, 1819 2021 and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation22 Kevin Smith's controversial film Dogma, 23 The Golden Compass, 24.25.26.27282930 and artist Cosimo Cavallaro, 31
Donohue is a staunch defender of Mel Gibson's controversial movie The Passion of the Christ. On the December 8, 2004 broadcast of Scarborough Country, in a discussion of the film Donohue claimed, &quot;Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular. It's not a secret, OK? And I'm not afraid to say it. That's why they hate this movie. It's about Jesus Christ, and it's about truth. It's about the Messiah.&quot; This statement was called anti-Semitic by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach on that same show. Donohue defended this statements as follows: &quot;In short, I did not single out secular Jews as some have said. Nonetheless, I do regret using the verb &quot;controlled&quot;, and that is because it suggests that there is some kind of cabal among secular Jews. That's nonsense. But is there a segment of the secular Jewish community that is anti-Catholic? Absolutely.&quot;
He has criticized Christmas cards sent by U.S. President George W. Bush using the term &quot;Holidays&quot; instead of &quot;Christmas&quot; on the White House&quot;32, as well as Mike Huckabee&lt;U+2019&gt;s use of what Donahue claims is Christian imagery for campaign purposes33
Moreover, he has protested employment discrimination against Catholics, in the case of a woman required by her supervisor to remove the Ash Wednesday ashes from her forehead34 and he has also spoken of the crisis over sexual abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests as &quot;a homosexual scandal, not a pedophilia scandal&quot;.353637
Parody
On April 4, 2007, South Park parodied Donohue in the eleventh season episode &quot;Fantastic Easter Special&quot; as a power-hungry official of the Catholic Church who overthrows the Pope and sentences Jesus (&quot;The Jew&quot;) to death for going against him and contradicting Catholic belief. In the show, the fictional Donohue calls Stan and Kyle, &quot;whores&quot;. Subsequently, Jesus kills Donohue.
