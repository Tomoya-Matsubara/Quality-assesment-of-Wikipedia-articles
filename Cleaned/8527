 Panamax and New Panamax are popular terms for the size limits for ships traveling through the Panama Canal. Formally, the limits and requirements are published by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) titled &quot;Vessel Requirements&quot;1. These vessel requirements also describes topics like exceptional dry seasonal limits, propulsion, communications and detailed ships design.
The allowable size is limited by the width and length of the available lock chambers, by the depth of the water in the canal and by the height of the Bridge of the Americas. Consequently, ships that do not fall within the Panamax-sizes are called Post Panamax. The limits have influenced those constructing cargo ships, giving clear parameters for ships destined to traverse the Panama Canal.
&quot;Panamax&quot; is in effect since the opening of the canal in 1914. In 2009 the Canal management published the &quot;New Panamax&quot;2, that will be in effect when the third lane of locks, larger than the current two, are operational from 2014.
The increasing prevalence of vessels of the maximum size is a problem for the canal as a Panamax ship is a tight fit that requires precise control of the vessel in the locks, possibly resulting in longer lock time, and requiring that these ships transit in daylight. Because the largest ships traveling in opposite directions cannot pass safely within the Gaillard Cut, the canal effectively operates an alternating one-way system for these ships.
Panamax Dimensions
  Panamax is determined principally by the dimensions of the canal's lock chambers, each of which is  wide by  long, and  deep. The usable length of each lock chamber is . The available water depth in the lock chambers varies, but the shallowest depth is at the south sill of the Pedro Miguel Locks and is  at a Miraflores Lake level of . The height of the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa is the limiting factor on a vessel's overall height.
The maximum dimensions allowed for a ship transiting the canal are:3
Length
Over all (including protrusions):  Exceptions:
Container ship and passenger ship: 
Tug-barge combination, rigidly connected:  over all
Other non-self-propelled vessels-tug combination:  over all
Width (beam):
Width over outer surface of the shell plating:  General exeption: , when draft is less than  Tropical freshwater.
Depth (draft):
In tropical fresh water . ACP uses the freshwater Gatun Lake as a reference. The salinity and temperature of water affect its density, and hence how deep a ship will float in the water. When the water level in Lake Gat&lt;U+00FA&gt;n is low during an exceptionally dry season the maximum permitted draft may be reduced.
Air draft:
measured from the waterline to the vessel's highest point; limit also pertains to Balboa harbor. Exception:  with passage at low water (MLWS) at Balboa is possible
All exceptions are typically allowed only after specific request, an investigation and on a one- or two-time only basis.
A Panamax cargo ship would typically have a DWT of 65,000-80,000 tonnes and a maximum cargo intake of 52,500 tonnes.4
The longest ship ever to transit was the San Juan Prospector, now Marcona Prospector, an ore-bulk-oil carrier that is  long, with a beam of .5 The widest ships to transit are the two North Carolina class battleships,  and , which have beams of .6
Post-Panamax ships
Post-Panamax or over-Panamax denote ships larger than Panamax that do not fit in the canal, such as supertankers and the largest modern container ships. The 'largest oil tanker in the world' - whichever ship held the title at the time - has not been able to transit the Panama Canal at least since the 'Idemitsu Maru' was launched in the 1960s; she was about 150,000 deadweight tons. U.S. Navy supercarriers are also in the post-Panamax class; the Nimitz class aircraft carriers are  long overall with a beam of , while the flight deck is  wide.
2006 Expansion plan and the New Panamax
   As early as the 1930s, new locks were proposed for the Panama Canal to ease congestion and to allow larger ships to pass. The project was abandoned in 1942.
On October 22, 2006, the Panama Canal Authority (with the support of the Electoral Tribunal) held a referendum for Panamanian citizens to vote on the Panama Canal expansion project. The expansion was approved by a wide margin, with support from about 78% of the electorate. It is estimated that the project will be completed by 2014 and will cost $5.3 billion; this sum is expected to be recovered within 11 years.
New Panamax
The plans to build bigger locks have led to the creation of &quot;New Panamax&quot;, based on new lock dimensions of , beam  and depth .7 Naval architects and civil engineers are already taking into account these dimensions for container ships.8 The world's largest cruise ship Oasis of the Seas has almost New Panamax dimensions with height difficult to pass under the Bridge of the Americas even at low tide.
After this expansion, the Panama Canal will be able to handle vessels of cargo capacity up to 9; currently, it can only handle vessels up to about .10 A third set of locks &lt;U+2013&gt;  long,  wide, with a draft of  &lt;U+2013&gt; will supplement the two existing sets.
However, even before the revised dimensions were announced, the Maersk E-class - like the Emma Maersk; as well as many large tankers - ULCCs; and some bulk carriers, VLOCs - will not be able to pass through even the new, much larger locks.
