The 1892 Alabama Crimson Tide football team (variously &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;UA&quot; or &quot;Bama&quot;) represented the University of Alabama in the 1892 college football season. The team was led by head coach E. B. Beaumont and played their home games at Lakeview Park in Birmingham, Alabama. In what was the inaugural season of Alabama football, the team finished with a record of two wins and two losses (2&lt;U+2013&gt;2). The first game in Alabama football history was played on November 11, 1892, against Birmingham High School that was won by Alabama 56&lt;U+2013&gt;0. They then split a pair of games with the Birmingham Athletic Club, and closed out the season with a 32&lt;U+2013&gt;22 loss in the first Iron Bowl against Auburn on February 22, 1893.
Schedule
For the 1892 season, point values were different from those used in contemporary games. In 1892 a touchdown was worth four points, a field goal was worth five points and an extra point was worth two points.1 Although played on February 22, 1893, Alabama considers the game against Auburn as part of the 1892 season.2
