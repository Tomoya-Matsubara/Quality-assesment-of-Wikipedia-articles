Leigh Woods is a  area of woodland on the south-west side of the Avon Gorge, close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, opposite the English city of Bristol and north of the Ashton Court estate, of which it formed a part.
Stokeleigh Camp, a hillfort thought to have been occupied from 3BC to 1AD and also in the Middle Ages, lies on the edge of the Nightingale Valley. Limestone and celestine which were worked in the 18th and 19th centuries are now derelict. In 1909 part of the woodland was donated to the National Trust by George Alfred Wills, to prevent development of the city beside the gorge following the bulding of the Leigh Woods suburb. Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.
It is as a national nature reserve and is included in the Avon Gorge Site of Special Scientific Interest,12 Rare trees include multiple species of Sorbus with at least nine native and four imported species. Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which is unique to the Avon Gorge can be seen flowering in April; various species of orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July.
Topography
The woods, which cover an area of , are on a ridge which mainly consists of limestone, with some sandstone which runs from Clifton to Clevedon,  away on the Bristol Channel coast. At the southern end of the wood is Nightingale Valley (one of several thus named in the area), a dry valley which is cut into the side of the gorge.3 It area slopes from the highest point nearly opposite the north gate of Ashton Court to the River Avon beside the western buttress of the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The woods are on the Monarch's Way long distance footpath.4
History
 Within Leigh Woods is Stokeleigh Camp, a hill fort thought to have been occupied from 3BC to 1AD and also in the Middle Ages.5 It is situated a promontory,6 bounding the north flank of the Nightingale Valley and occupying around .78 Stokeleigh Camp is thought to have been occupied from the late pre-Roman Iron Age, when it was in the area controlled by the Dobunni.9 Archaeological investigations suggest during the 1st century Belgae tribes may have been present with some of the pottery showing the influence of the Durotriges. There may have been a break in occupation before reuse in the middle to late 2nd century.10 In addition to the pottery recovered a possible coin of Gallienus dating from his reign between 253 and 268 has been recovered. An iron-involuted brooch of the La T&lt;U+00E8&gt;ne II type has also been found.11 It is unclear whether the occupation of Stokeleigh Camp in the 3rd century was for a formal garrison or whether it was just used by &quot;squatters&quot; or as a place of refuge in times of crisis. Stokeleigh was connected with the Wansdyke, a series of defensive linear earthworks, consisting of a ditch and an embankment running at least from Maes Knoll in Somerset, to the Savernake Forest near Marlborough in Wiltshire, however there is little evidence for this.12 It is also possible that the site was occupied in the Middle Ages.13
 North of Stockleigh Camp are a series of limestone and mineral quarries, overlooking the River Avon, which are now disused. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries this had an important celestine quarry and mineral line to a dock on the Avon; both are now derelict.1415 The area has of recent years been restored as an arboretum. At the northern end of the woods is Paradise Bottom. This is included in the Leigh Court Estate and was part of the ground laid out by Humphry Repton16 for Philip John Miles. Some of the first plantings of the giant redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum)and the Weymouth pine (Pinus strobus) among other &quot;exotics&quot; imported to the UK were made here by Sir William Miles in the 1860s.1718
To the south of the woods is an expensive suburb of Bristol also known as Leigh Woods. It is situated at the western end of the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which opened in 1864, making the development of Leigh Woods as an upmarket residential area practicable.19 Houses in varying styles were built from the mid-1860s until the First World War.20 Styles adopted included Italian, neo-Jacobean, Scottish baronial, Swiss chalet, domestic revival and arts and crafts.21 At the western end of the bridge is Burwalls House, a Victorian mansion owned by the University of Bristol and used as a centre for continuing education.2223 On a bluff overlooking the bridge is Alpenfels, a mock Swiss chalet constructed for the Wills tobacco family.24  In 1857 the mutilated body of a murdered woman was found in Nightingale Valley.25 In January 1858 John Beale was hanged at Taunton for the crime.26 A further violent death occurred in 1948 when George Henry Chinnock, who had been living in the woods was found with head injuries.27
Part of the woodland was donated to the National Trust in 1909 by George Alfred Wills,28 to prevent development of the city beside the gorge.29 Areas not owned by the National Trust have since been taken over by the Forestry Commission.30
The Portishead Railway runs along the bottom of the woods. It was closed by the Beeching cuts in the 1960s, but has now been reopened for freight traffic as far as Royal Portbury Dock,  downstream.31 Between 1928 and 1932, the area had its own railway station, Nightingale Valley Halt. The station opened on 9 July 1928, and closed on 12 September 1932. At present (2013) discussion is taking place to reopen the entire line to passenger traffic.
In 1957 a Filton-based RAF Vampire jet from 501 Squadron piloted by Flying officer John Greenwood flew under the deck of the suspension bridge while performing a victory roll before crashing in Leigh Woods, killing the pilot.
Small mountain biking circuits are present in the woods and the area is a popular walking area for Bristolians.3233
Flora and fauna
 Because of the rare flora and fauna the woods have been included in the Avon Gorge Site of Special Scientific Interest,34 and  has been designated as a national nature reserve.3536
The south part of the woods is an area of former pasture woodland with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (Sorbus bristoliensis) and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, making it one of the most important sites in Britain for this tree.3738 Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the white-letter hairstreak (Satyrium w-album).39
On the steep grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which is unique to the Avon Gorge can be seen flowering in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July.40 In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi.4142 Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found on the western side of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.
