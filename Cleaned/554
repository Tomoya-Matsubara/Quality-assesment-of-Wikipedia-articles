He would knock down trophies of his sister and challenge his sister, Krystal, to games, who said, &quot;Most people learn basketball early on with a one-on-one kind of mentality ... Tim at an early age didn't have that. He always wanted to make the team better and do whatever it takes to help team out. He is such a true point guard.&quot; In his childhood, he was considered &quot;too small&quot; for contact sports, but was noted for his quickness, which helped him thrive as a guard on the court.1

He graduated high school with cum laude.4
On October 23, 2008, Frazier verbally committed to the Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team in college. He said to Scout.com, &quot;I decided to be a Nittany Lion because I felt it was a great fit for me. Penn State has great academics as well as a great basketball team and that's what I was looking for.&quot; Frazier also said that he had a &quot;great time&quot; on his official visit and all his relatives supported the decision.5 He also received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008.6 After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, &quot;We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we think he really solidifies our backcourt for the future.&quot;7

Freshman
Prior to the start of his freshman year, Frazier recorded a team-high 34-inch vertical in Penn State's preseason workouts. He also matched the 2009 NBA Draft Combine record, and surpassed the event's best lane agility time.8 Frazier did not participate in Penn State's exhibition opener against Slippery Rock. Coach DeChellis said, &quot;Billy Oliver, Sasa [Borovnjak], Tim Frazier, Jermaine Marshall, they haven't played in this yet, so it was important just to get out there.&quot;9 In his first official appearance against Pennsylvania, Frazier added 2 points and 1 rebound in a scoreless performance. He was only allowed 8 minutes of play time.10 He scored his first points against Robert Morris the following contest, with a game-high 19 points off the bench.

The team coach, DeChellis, said, &quot;(Tim) is a hard guy to contain. If he starts making perimeter shots, then we're that much better. We've seen him where he can make shots in practice and do pretty well. We just needed to get him some confidence and get him into the flow.&quot;11 The game would remain a season-high for him under the scoring category.12 Frazier was awarded his first start as a shooting guard on November 22, 2009 against Davidson, 7 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, and 3 steals.

Frazier recalled the moment, &quot;I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted a couple of times and then stepped through.&quot;18 Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez said, &quot;I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. For some reason he jumped over to my right and that gave me the space to go left.&quot;19 By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game.
