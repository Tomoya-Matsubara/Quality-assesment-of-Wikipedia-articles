The Dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya Movement is a Buddhist movement founded in Thailand in the 1970s.
Origins
It was founded by the Thai meditation master Phramongkolthepmuni(1885&lt;U+2013&gt;1959) - a celebrated meditation master and the late abbot of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen, Thonburi. The movement is primarily represented today by its non-profit foundation, the Dhammakaya Foundation, and the Wat Phra Dhammakaya temple in Pathum Thani Province, Thailand.
Identifying features
This meditation school formally belongs to the ancient Maha Nikaya tradition of Thai Theravada Buddhism.,1 being correctly regarded as revivalist rather than a new movement or a fundamentalist movement.23 It supposedly has many doctrinal elements to distinguish it from conventional Therav&lt;U+0101&gt;da Buddhism and in some respects resembles the tathagatagarbha (Buddha Nature) doctrines of Mah&lt;U+0101&gt;y&lt;U+0101&gt;na Buddhism4, but has not been taken as heterodox by most Buddhists in Thailand. The Dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya school of meditation is marked by its literal interpretation of Buddhist technical terms, (including the term dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya) in their physical meaning, as described by Phramongkolthepmuni. Many sermons of Phramongkolthepmuni himself can be traced back to some schools of meditation in Southeast Asia preserved only in ancient meditation manuals.
Personalities
One factor which catalyzes this Foundation is the personality of Phramongkolthepmuni (1884&lt;U+2013&gt;1959) . The account of his attaining dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya in 1916 through his willingness to lay down his life evoked the image of 'self-sacrifice' in the minds of his disciples.
Dhammakaya Foundation
The Dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya Foundation was founded in 1916 in Thailand by Phra Monkolthepmuni, the abbot of Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen. Following the death of Phra Monkolthepmuni, the Foundation's work was continued by his disciple, Khun Yay Mah&lt;U+0101&gt; Ratana Up&lt;U+0101&gt;sik&lt;U+0101&gt; Chandra Khonnokyoong, a Buddhist mae chi. In 1970, a temple, called Wat Phra Dhammakaya, was constructed as a home for the movement. Located in Khlong Luang, Pathum Thani Province, the temple was intended to become an international center for the study of meditation.
Wat Phra Dhammakaya
Wat Phra Dhammakaya is a Buddhist temple (wat) in Khlong Luang District, Pathum Thani Province north of Bangkok, Thailand. It was established on Magha Puja Day, 20 February 1970, on an eighty-acre (320,000 m&lt;U+00B2&gt;) plot of land donated by Lady Prayat Phaetayapongsa-visudhathibodi. The site, sixteen kilometres north of Bangkok International Airport, was originally called 'Soon Buddacakk-patipatthamm'. From acidic paddy fields, a woodland was created: a parkland for meditators. The foundation stone for the main chapel laid by H.R.H. Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on behalf of H.M. the King in December 1977 marked the official foundation of the centre as a temple&lt;U+2014&gt;Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The movement produced a CDROM5 of the Pali Buddhist Scriptures in cooperation with the Pali Text Society in 1995 and by the year 2000 its monastic students were the most successful Pali students in Thailand.6
Public accusations of 1999-2002
The Dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya Foundation has been subject to its share of controversy. In 199978 and again in 2002,910 leaders of the organization were accused of charges ranging from fraud and embezzlement to corruption. At that time social critic Sulak Sivaraksa criticized the Dhammakaya Movement for promoting greed by emphasizing donations to the temple as a way to make merit. Widespread negative media coverage a this time was symptomatic of the movement being made the scapegoat for commercial malpractice in the Thai Buddhist temple community1112 in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.1314
In 2006 The Thai National Office for Buddhism cleared the Dhammakaya Foundation and Phrarajbhavanavisudh of all accusations15 when Phrarajbhavanavisudh agreed to return all the allegedly embezzled funds to name of his temple. Phrarajbhavanavisudh was subsequently restored to the position of abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya.16
Present
Under the leadership of president Phrarajbhavanavisudh (Luang Phaw Dhammajayo, b.1944), the image of the Dhammak&lt;U+0101&gt;ya Foundation has made a recovery, and in 2004-5 had received further recognition for its contribution to world peace from organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Thai Senate, and several peoples' associations in the South of Thailand. The Dhammakaya Movement continues to influence millions of people in Thailand and worldwide to practice Dhammakaya meditation. The movement has set up Dhammakaya Open University in Azusa, California in 2003 to offer degree courses in Buddhist studies. It has also encouraged Thais to quit drinking and smoking through the activities of Anti-Drinking and Anti-Smoking program. World Health Organization (WHO) presented the 2004 World No Tobacco Day Award for this work on 31 May 200417 4
The movement has expanded branches to over eighteen countries worldwide and is promoted via a Buddhist satellite network or Dhamma Media Channel (DMC.TV) with a 24 hour-a-day Dharma and meditation teachings broadcast to the audience worldwide.
Accusations that the Thai Government had financed activities at Wat Phra Dhammakaya were made in a letter by Sulak Sivalaksa on 10 May 201018 but the government issued a press release on 12 May to deny the accusations19
