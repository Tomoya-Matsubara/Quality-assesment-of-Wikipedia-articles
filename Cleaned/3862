A sex-determination system is a biological system that determines the development of sexual characteristics in an organism. Most sexual organisms have two sexes. In many cases, sex determination is genetic: males and females have different alleles or even different genes that specify their sexual morphology. In animals, this is often accompanied by chromosomal differences. In other cases, sex is determined by environmental variables (such as temperature) or social variables (the size of an organism relative to other members of its population). The details of some sex-determination systems are not yet fully understood.
Origin of sex chromosomes
The accepted hypothesis of XY and ZW sex chromosome evolution is that they evolved at the same time, in two different branches.12 However, there is some evidence to suggest that there could have been transitions between ZW and XY, such as in Xiphophorus maculatus, which have both ZW and XY systems in the same population, despite the fact that ZW and XY have different gene locations.3 4 Regardless, XY and ZW follow a similar route. All sex chromosomes started out as an original autosome of an ancestral reptile that relied upon temperature to determine the sex of offspring. After the mammals separated, the branch further split into Lepidosauria and Archosauromorpha. These two groups both evolved the ZW system separately, as evidenced by the existence of different sex chromosomal locations.5 In mammals, one of the autosome pair mutated its SOX3 gene into the SRY gene.67 After this mutation, the SRY-containing chromosome inverted and could no longer swap genes with its partner. The Y chromosome continued to receive mutations throughout the years, and without a partner to combine with, it slowly decayed.8 However, because both the chromosomes were necessary for reproduction, the Y chromosome remained, despite its inability to pair with the X.
Chromosomal determination
XX/XY sex chromosomes
  The XX/XY sex-determination system is the most familiar, as it is found in humans. In the system, females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), while males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY). The XY sex chromosomes are different in shape and size from each other, unlike the autosomes, and are termed allosomes. Some species (including humans) have a gene SRY on the Y chromosome that determines maleness; others (such as the fruit fly) use the presence of two X chromosomes to determine femaleness. In Y-centered sex determination, the SRY gene is not the only gene to have an influence on sex. In XY mice, lack of the gene DAX1 on the X chromosome results in sterility, but in humans it causes adrenal hypoplasia congenita. 9 However, when an extra DAX1 gene is placed on the X, the result is a female, despite the existence of SRY. 10
The XX/XY system is also found in most other mammals, as well as some insects. However, at least one monotreme, the platypus, presents a particular sex determination scheme that in some ways resembles that of the ZW sex chromosomes of birds, and also lacks the SRY gene, whereas some rodents, such as several Arvicolinae (voles and lemmings), are also noted for their unusual sex determination systems. The platypus has ten sex chromosomes; males have an XYXYXYXYXY pattern while females have ten X chromosomes. Although it is an XY system, the platypus' sex chromosomes share no homologues with eutherian sex chromosomes.11 Instead, homologues with eutherian sex chromosomes lie on the platypus chromosome 6, which means that the eutherian sex chromosomes were autosomes at the time that the monotremes diverged from the therian mammals (marsupials and eutherian mammals). However, homologues to the avian DMRT1 gene on platypus sex chromosomes X3 and X5 suggest that it is possible the sex-determining gene for the platypus is the same one that is involved in bird sex-determination. However, more research must be conducted in order to determine the exact sex determining gene of the platypus.12
XX/X0 sex determination
In this variant of the XY system, females have two copies of the sex chromosome (XX) but males have only one (X0). The 0 denotes the absence of a second sex chromosome. This system is observed in a number of insects, including the grasshoppers and crickets of order Orthoptera and in cockroaches (order Blattodea).
The nematode C. elegans is male with one sex chromosome (X0); with a pair of chromosomes (XX) it is a hermaphrodite.13
A small number of mammals also lack a Y chromosome. These include the Amami spiny rat (Tokudaia osimensis) and the Tokunoshima spiny rat (Tokudaia tokunoshimensis). Voles also have a form of XO determination in which both genders lack a second sex chromosome. 14 The mechanism of sex determination is not yet understood.15
ZW sex chromosomes
The ZW sex-determination system is found in birds, some insects and other organisms. The ZW sex-determination system is reversed compared to the XY system: females have two different kinds of chromosomes (ZW), and males have two of the same kind of chromosomes (ZZ). In the chicken, this was found to be dependent on the expression of DMRT1.16 However, not all species depend upon the W for their gender. For example, there are moths and butterflies that are ZW, but some have been found female with ZO, as well as female with ZZW.17 Also, while mammals inactivate one of their extra X chromosomes when female, it appears that in the case of Lepidoptera, the males produce double the normal amount of enzymes, due to having two Z's.18 Because the use of ZW sex determination is varied, it is still unknown how exactly most species determine their sex.19 Despite the similarities between ZW and XY, the sex chromosomes do not line up correctly and evolved separately. In the case of the chicken, their Z chromosome is more similar to humans' autosome 9.20 The chicken's Z chromosome also seems to match with the X chromosomes of the platypus.21
Haplodiploid sex chromosomes
Haplodiploidy
Haplodiploidy is found in insects belonging to Hymenoptera, such as ants and bees. Unfertilized eggs develop into haploid individuals, which are the males. Diploid individuals are generally female but may be sterile males. Thus, if a queen bee mates with one drone, her daughters share &lt;U+00BE&gt; of their genes with each other, not &lt;U+00BD&gt; as in the XY and ZW systems. This is believed to be significant for the development of eusociality, as it increases the significance of kin selection, but it is debated. 22 Most females in the Hymenoptera order can decide the sex of their offspring by releasing sperm or not. This allows them to create more workers, depending on the status of the colony. 23
Non-genetic sex-determination systems
Many other sex-determination systems exist. In some species of reptiles, including alligators, some turtles, and the tuatara, sex is determined by the temperature at which the egg is incubated. Some species, such as some snails, practice sex change: adults start out male, then become female. In tropical clown fish, the dominant individual in a group becomes female while the other ones are male, and bluehead wrasses (Thalassoma bifasciatum) are the reverse. In the marine worm Bonellia viridis, larvae become males if they make physical contact with a female, and females if they end up on the bare sea floor.
Some species, however, have no sex-determination system. Hermaphrodites include the common earthworm and certain species of snails. A few species of fish, reptiles, and insects reproduce by parthenogenesis and are female altogether.
In some arthropods, sex is determined by infection, as when Bacteria of the genus Wolbachia alter their sexuality; some species consist entirely of ZZ individuals, with sex determined by the presence of Wolbachia.
Other unusual systems (this section is still being researched):
Swordtail fish
The Chironomus midge species
The Platypus has 10 sex chromosomes24 but lacks the mammalian sex-determining gene SRY, meaning that the process of sex determination in the Platypus remains unknown.25
