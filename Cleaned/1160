In radio communication, a ground dipole,1 also referred to as an earth dipole antenna, transmission line antenna,2 and in technical literature as a horizontal electric dipole (HED),345 is a huge, specialized type of radio antenna that radiates extremely low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic waves.67 It is the only type of transmitting antenna that can radiate practical amounts of power in the ELF frequency range of 3 Hz to 3 kHz.8 A ground dipole consists of two ground electrodes buried in the earth, separated by tens to hundreds of kilometers, linked by overhead transmission lines to a power plant transmitter located between them.910 Alternating current electricity flows in a giant loop between the electrodes through the ground, radiating ELF waves, so the ground is part of the antenna. To be most effective, ground dipoles must be located over certain types of underground rock formations.11 The idea was proposed by U.S. Dept. of Defense physicist Nicholas Christofilos in 1959.12
Although small ground dipoles have been used for years as sensors in geological and geophysical research, their only use as antennas has been in a few military ELF transmitter facilities to communicate with submerged submarines. Besides small research and experimental antennas,1314 three full-scale ground dipole installations are known to have been constructed; two by the U.S. Navy at Republic, Michigan and Clam Lake, Wisconsin,151617 and one by the Russian Navy on the Kola peninsula near Murmansk, Russia.181920 The U.S. facilities were used between 1985 and 2004 but are now decommissioned.21
Antennas at ELF frequencies
ELF frequencies (according to one of several definitions) range from 3 Hz to 3 kHz, with corresponding wavelengths from 100,000 km to 100 km.22 The frequency used in the U.S. and Russian transmitters, about 80 Hz,2324 generates waves 3750 km (2300 miles) long,2526 roughly one quarter of the Earth's diameter. ELF waves have been used in very few manmade communications systems because of the difficulty of building efficient antennas for such long waves. Ordinary types of antenna (half-wave dipoles and quarter-wave monopoles) cannot be built for such extremely long waves because of their size. A half wave dipole for 80 Hz would be 1162 miles long. So even the largest practical antennas for ELF frequencies are very electrically short, very much smaller than the wavelength of the waves they radiate.27 The disadvantage of this is that the efficiency of an antenna drops as its size is reduced below a wavelength.28 An antenna's radiation resistance, and the amount of power it radiates, is proportional to (L/&lt;U+03BB&gt;)2 where L is its length and &lt;U+03BB&gt; is the wavelength. So even physically large ELF antennas have very small radiation resistance, and so radiate only a tiny fraction of the input power as ELF waves; most of the power applied to them is dissipated as heat in various ohmic resistances in the antenna.29 ELF antennas must be tens to hundreds of kilometers long, and must be driven by powerful transmitters in the megawatt range, to produce even a few watts of ELF radiation. Fortunately, the attenuation of ELF waves with distance is so low (1 - 2 dB per 1000 km)30 that a few watts of radiated power is enough to communicate worldwide.31
A second problem stems from the required polarization of the waves. ELF waves only propagate long distances in vertical polarization, with the direction of the magnetic field lines horizontal and the electric field lines vertical.32 Vertically oriented antennas are required to generate vertically polarized waves. Even if sufficiently large conventional antennas could be built on the surface of the Earth, these would generate horizontally polarized, not vertically polarized waves.
History

In 1958, the realization that ELF waves could penetrate seawater led U.S. physicist Nicholas Christofilos to suggest that the U.S. Navy use them to communicate with submarines.3334 The U.S. military researched many different types of antenna for use at ELF frequencies. Cristofilos proposed applying currents to the Earth to create a vertical loop antenna, and it became clear that this was the most practical design.3536 The feasibility of the ground dipole idea was tested in 1962 with a 42 km leased power line in Wyoming, and in 1963 with a 176 km prototype wire antenna extending from West Virginia to North Carolina.3738
How a ground dipole works
A ground dipole functions as an enormous vertically-oriented loop antenna3940 (see drawing, right). It consists of two widely separated electrodes (G) buried in the ground, connected by overhead transmission cables to a transmitter (P) located between them. The alternating current from the transmitter (I) travels in a loop through one transmission line, kilometers deep into bedrock from one ground electrode to the other, and back through the other transmission line. This creates an alternating magnetic field (H) through the loop, which radiates ELF waves. The axis of the magnetic field produced is horizontal, so it generates vertically polarized waves. The radiation pattern of the antenna is directional, with two lobes (maxima) in the plane of the loop, off the ends of the transmission lines.4142 In the U.S. installations two ground dipoles are used, oriented perpendicular to each other, to allow transmission in all directions.
The amount of power radiated by a loop antenna is proportional to (IA)2, where I is the AC current in the loop and A is the area enclosed,43 To radiate practical power at ELF frequencies, the loop has to carry a current of hundreds of amperes and enclose an area of at least several square miles.44 Christofilos found that the lower the electrical conductivity of the underlying rock, the deeper the current will go, and the larger the effective loop area.4546 Radio frequency current will penetrate into the ground to a depth equal to the skin depth of the ground at that frequency, which is inversely proportional to the square root of ground conductivity &lt;U+03C3&gt;. The ground dipole forms a loop with effective area of A = L&lt;U+03B4&gt; / √2, where L is the total length of the transmission lines and &lt;U+03B4&gt; is the skin depth.4748 So ground dipoles are sited over low conductivity underground rock formations (this contrasts with ordinary radio antennas, which require good earth conductivity for a low resistance ground connection for their transmitters). The two U.S. Navy antennas were located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, on the Canadian Shield (Laurentian Shield) formation,4950 which has unusually low conductivity of 2&lt;U+00D7&gt;10&lt;U+2212&gt;4 siemens/meter.51 resulting in an increase in antenna efficiency of 20 dB.52 The earth conductivity at the site of the Russian transmitter is even lower.53
Because of their lack of civilian applications, little information about ground dipoles is available in antenna technical literature.
U.S. Navy Project ELF antennas
thumb|upright=2.0|Map showing location of the US Navy ELF transmitters. The red lines show the paths of the ground dipole antennas. The Clam Lake facility (left) had two crossed 14 mi. ground dipoles. The Republic facility had two 14 mi. dipoles oriented east-west, and one 28 mi. dipole oriented north-south.
After initially considering several larger systems (Project Sanguine), the U.S. Navy constructed two ELF transmitter facilities, one at Clam Lake, Wisconsin and the other at Republic, Michigan, 145 miles apart.5455 They could operate independently, or phase synchronized as one antenna for greater output power.56 The Clam Lake site, the initial test facility, transmitted its first signal in 198257 and began operation in 1985, while the Republic site became operational in 1989.
The Clam Lake antenna consisted of two perpendicular 14 mile (24 km) ground dipole transmission lines in the shape of a cross, with the transmitter station at their intersection.5859 The Republic antenna consisted of three ground dipoles, two 14 mile and one 28 mile transmission line,60 in the shape of the letter &quot;F&quot; (the shape is not significant and was dictated by land availability).61 The lines, made of 1.5 cm aluminum cable supported on insulators on 40 ft. wooden poles, resembled ordinary power transmission lines.62 The ends of the transmission lines were grounded by 1 to 3 miles of buried copper cable and ground rods,63 later replaced by arrays of electrodes in deep 300 ft. boreholes,64 to reduce surface ground currents to address environmental concerns.
The transmitters operated at a frequency of 76 Hz, with an alternate frequency capability of 45 Hz.65 Each Clam Lake ground dipole was normally driven with a current of 300 amperes, from a 1.2 MW peak power transmitter powered from a 4160 V utility line with diesel backup.66 Each loop had a resistance of 5 ohms and an inductance of 50 millihenries, which could be tuned out by capacitor banks.67 The transmitter synthesized the sinusoidal output waveform with banks of high power SCRs.68 The relative amplitude and phase of the drive current in each of the perpendicular loops could be controlled to radiate in a specific direction, or equally in all directions.69
As with all ELF radiators, the antennas were extremely inefficient, with almost all of the input power dissipated as heat in ground resistance. At an input power of 450 kW, each of the Clam Lake dipoles radiated less than 1 watt of ELF waves, giving an efficiency of 2&lt;U+00D7&gt;10&lt;U+2212&gt;6.70 The total output power of both sites working together was 8 watts.71 However due of the low attenuation of ELF waves this tiny radiated power was able to communicate with submarines over about half the Earth's surface.72
Throughout their operating life both antennas were controversial, and the focus of legal challenges and protests attempting to shut them down, by antiwar groups and environmental groups concerned about the effects of electromagnetic radiation exposure.73747576 On five occasions transmission line poles were cut down by protesters, temporarily interrupting operation.7778
Both transmitters were shut down in 2004.7980 The official Navy explanation was that advances in VLF communication systems had made them unnecessary.81
Russian Navy ZEVS antennas
The Russian Navy operates an ELF transmitter facility, named ZEVS (&quot;Zeus&quot;), to communicate with its submarines, located northwest of Murmansk on the Kola peninsula in northern Russia.8283 Signals from it were detected in the 1990s at Stanford University and elsewhere.8485 It normally operates at 82 Hz, using MSK (minimum shift keying) modulation.86 although it reportedly can cover the frequency range from 20 to 250 Hz.8788 It reportedly consists of two parallel ground dipole antennas 60 km long, driven at currents of 200 to 300 amperes.8990 Calculations from intercepted signals indicate it is 10 dB more powerful than the U.S. transmitters.91 Unlike them it is used for geophysical research in addition to military communications.9293
Radiated power
The total power radiated by a ground dipole is94
$$P = \frac {\pi^2 f^2 I^2 L^2}{2 c^2 h \sigma} \,$$ where
f is the frequency
I is the RMS current in the loop
L is the length of the transmission line
c is the speed of light
h is the height above ground of the ionosphere D layer
&lt;U+03C3&gt; is the ground conductivity
The radiated power of an electrically small loop antenna normally scales with the fourth power of the frequency, but at ELF frequencies the effects of the ionosphere result in a less severe reduction in power proportional to the square of frequency.
Receiving antennas
Ground dipoles are not needed for reception of ELF signals. The requirements for receiving antennas at ELF frequencies are less stringent than transmitting antennas, because the signal to noise ratio in ELF receivers is dominated by the large atmospheric noise in the band. The level of signal strength at the antenna is far above the noise in the receiver circuit, so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used. Various types of coil and ferrite loop antennas have been used for reception.
