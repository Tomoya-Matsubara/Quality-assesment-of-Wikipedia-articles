and  are the two fourth-generation Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon role-playing video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. They are the first of the traditional Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon role-playing games for the Nintendo DS video game console. The games were earlier released in Japan in 2006. Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Pearl had the most successful launch week of games in the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon series in Japan, and the best launch week for any Nintendo DS game in Japan.1 Additionally, the games set the record of being the fastest selling Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games in Japan within three months of sales.2 Set in the fictional region of Sinnoh, the games cover the adventure of a single protagonist embarking on a quest to capture and train Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon while simultaneously thwarting the agenda of the criminal organization Team Galactic.
Diamond and Pearl, like the past generations of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games, add an extensive amount of new features, such as internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection,3 while building onto older game concepts such as Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Contests.4
Setting and plot
Diamond and Pearl are set in the region of Sinnoh, which is based upon the Hokkaid&lt;U+014D&gt; prefecture of Japan. Sinnoh is characterized by both mountainous and snow-covered areas, and contains three lakes central to the plot.
The game contains 107 new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon and chronicles the adventures of a new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon trainer who vies to become the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon League Champion, collecting and training various species of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon along the way. As do most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon type. Gym Leaders serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with badges of merit, key to the advancement of the plot.  Diamond and Pearl begin in Twinleaf Town. After viewing a television report about disturbances at a distant lake by a red Gyarados, the protagonist and his/her rival travel together to investigate the local lake. They spot Professor Rowan, an expert in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon evolution, and the protagonist&lt;U+2019&gt;s second rival, who is the playable character not selected. After a short discussion the pair exits from the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Mukkuru, the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice between three Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon found in the briefcase, Naetle, Hikozaru or Pochama. After defeating the Mukkuru, they return the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his/her chosen Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, Rowan offers it to him/her, asking that he embark on a journey and fill his/her Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex.
As the plot continues, the protagonist encounters Team Galactic, and their motives are made clear. Team Galactic captures Yuxie, Agnome and Emrit, of Sinnoh&lt;U+2019&gt;s three lakes, and imprisons them, making it the player&lt;U+2019&gt;s responsibility to free them. Upon releasing the trio, he/she is able to travel to the sacred shrine atop Tengan Mountain and enter the cave, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens either Dialga, in Diamond, or Palkia in Pearl. Dialga or Palkia&lt;U+2019&gt;s powers begin to &lt;U+201C&gt;overwhelm&lt;U+201D&gt; Sinnoh, causing the newly free Yuxie, Agnome and Emrit to attempt to stop it. It is then that the player is able to engage in a battle with the version-appropriate legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.
Gameplay
 Gameplay is very similar to previous Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon RPGs, but there are several changes and additions.
Within each species, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon now feature varying levels of gender dimorphism, including aspects such as differently sized or absent distinctive physical features. For example, a female Wooper has smaller antennae than its male counterpart and a male Scizor has a smaller abdomen than a female.5 As in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Crystal and Emerald, opposing Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon each have a short animation (e.g., a Geodude will flex its arms) when entering battle. New abilities, such as &lt;U+201C&gt;Belligerence&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;Natural&lt;U+201D&gt;, have been added. Baby Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in Diamond and Pearl, such as Roselia&lt;U+2019&gt;s pre-evolution Subomie, can be found in the wild, whereas in previous generations attaining one usually required breeding. Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon also hatch from their eggs at Level 1, rather than Level 5 as in the previous games.
Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Contests, events where one&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon compete in a show of sorts to win ribbons, return from Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ruby and Sapphire as &lt;U+201C&gt;Super Contests&lt;U+201D&gt;, with similarities and differences.6 Super Contests consist of three rounds. In the Visual Judgment round, players utilize the Nintendo DS&lt;U+2019&gt;s stylus to place accessories and objects on their Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to appeal to a particular trait, such as &lt;U+201C&gt;Cool&lt;U+201D&gt; or &lt;U+201C&gt;Cute&lt;U+201D&gt;, and earn points. In the Dance Judgment round, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon compete with opponents in a test of rhythm and balance. The final round, Performance Judgment, is identical in premise to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Contests of the third generation of games; Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon use their techniques strategically to appeal to the judges and crowd. Assuming the same role as Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;blocks in the 3rd generation, a baked substance called Pofin can be made through use of the touchscreen and fed to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in order to increase certain traits and, consequently, the likelihood of success in a relevant Contest.
First introduced in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Gold and Silver, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl features sensitivity to the time of day and day of the week, which is reflected in a number of facets, such as the lighting of the overworld and locations of non-player characters, the availability of certain species of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, and even the lighting during battles. The scale of the day and night cycle has grown from the original cycle of morning, day, and night; Diamond and Pearl's cycle features five different time periods: morning, day, afternoon, evening and night.7
A new device called the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;tch, resembling a wristwatch, can be obtained and plays host to a wide variety of features, including a time management system, a calculator, a map, a counter, a wireless link up search, and drawing pad.8
Below Sinnoh is a large underground area, used for multiplayer gaming. Players can create and decorate &lt;U+201C&gt;secret bases&lt;U+201D&gt; (first featured in Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ruby and Sapphire) and participate in minigames, one of which will allow the player to unearth fossilized Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon. Initially, only one fossil can be found in each game; the Shield Fossil (Zugaidos) in Diamond, and the Helmet Fossil (new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Tatetops) in Pearl. However, after unlocking the National Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex it is possible to find the Dome Fossil (Kabuto), the Helix Fossil (Omanyte), Old Amber (Aerodactyl), Claw Fossil (Anorith), or the Root Fossil (Lileep) in both versions.9
Diamond and Pearl employ support for the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, allowing players to trade, battle and communicate through &lt;U+201C&gt;voice chat&lt;U+201D&gt; online.10 The main system for trade is the Global Trade Station trading system. This allows trainers to search for any Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon they have seen on a worldwide scale, with the resulting list showing people around the world who are willing to trade that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, as well as the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon they want in return for it.11 The trade does not have to be instant and an offer can be left for other players to browse and complete, even while the player is offline. Some centers serve different purposes - one allows the player to enter battles against friends over an internet connection, while another allows the player to enter the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Union, a chat room in which the player can communicate with others on the player's Friends List.12
Along with the 50 existing Technical Machines (TMs), which teach Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon a new move, 42 new TMs have been added to the game while the previous 50 have been retained, bringing the total to 92. This marks the first time an entire 50-TM set has been left intact between generations, and the first time the total number has exceeded 50 (58 counting HMs). Two of the eight Hidden Machines (HMs), which, like TMs, teach Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon a new move (but permanently), have also been changed, and one former HM has been downgraded to a TM.
Connectivity to other games
Diamond and Pearl boast compatibility with many other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games. They can connect with the Game Boy Advance Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon RPGs after earning the National Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex, when the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Game Boy Advance cartridge is inserted into slot 2 (the Game Boy Advance cartridge and accessory slot of the Nintendo DS) while Diamond or Pearl is in slot 1 (the DS card slot). After uploading six Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, players go to an area called Pal Park and must capture them in the wild.13 Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon uploads are restricted to six per day per GBA cartridge, and the player will have to re-capture such transferred Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in Pal Park with a special Park Ball that has 100% chance of capture before transferring from another GBA game. Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon cannot be transferred from an English GBA game to a Japanese DS game, and the player cannot transfer any of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon back to the GBA cartridge once they are transferred to Diamond or Pearl.
Certain Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon transferred from a foreign GBA Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon game to a Japanese GBA game that are then uploaded via Pal Park will have extra Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex descriptions matching the language of the foreign game.14 A new function added to the player&lt;U+2019&gt;s Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;dex with that specific Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon allows switching of the descriptions between different languages. These languages include Japanese, English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.
The use of Pal Park is necessary if a player wishes to obtain the starter or legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon from a previous generation of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games.15 All other Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon can be found and caught/obtained in Diamond and Pearl, however some are only available while the player has a Game Boy Advance Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon RPG inserted in Slot 2 of the Nintendo DS.16
In addition, Diamond and Pearl are able to connect to Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ranger. Using this feature a player will be able to send a Manaphy egg from Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ranger to Diamond or Pearl after completing a special mission in Ranger.17 Diamond and Pearl also feature Wi-Fi connectivity with the Wii Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon title Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Battle Revolution.18

On May 14, 2004, the first Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon of the fourth generation, Munchlax, was revealed. Following the pre-evolved form of Snorlax, several other new Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to appear in Diamond and Pearl were revealed in articles in CoroCoro Comic. Early in production, it was intended that Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon introduced in previous generations of the series would receive new, pre-evolved forms; Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon available from as far back as Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Red and Blue can now be bred to produce new infantile species, such as Mr. Mime who is preceded by Mime Jr. and Chansey by Pinpuku. Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon have been given new, further evolved forms; for example, Electabuzz can now evolve into Elekible and Roselia can now evolve into Roserade. The games introduce more legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon than any set of games before them.
The de facto mascots of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl were confirmed as Dialga and Palkia , like Groudon and Kyogre or Ho-Oh and Lugia before them, when video game packaging for the games was released in late June 2006; as their names suggest, Dialga represents Diamond, and Palkia represents Pearl.
Music
Music in Diamond and Pearl was scored by Hitomi Sat&lt;U+014D&gt; and Junichi Masuda under the supervision of G&lt;U+014D&gt; Ichinose.19 A two-disc soundtrack featuring music from the games was released on December 22, 2006.20
Reception
Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl have been met with positive reception in Japan. Though two million copies of the games were shipped for Japan alone, there were still shortages in response to a large demand.21 The games became the fastest selling Nintendo DS titles in Japan for the first week of sales since its release, a record previously held by New Super Mario Bros..22 Within forty-six days, the games sold three million units, becoming the fastest DS game to do so, and by the end of the year, the number increased to five million units in just under three months, marking itself as the fastest- and best-selling Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon game in Japan alone.23
Glitches
Nintendo released a statement detailing glitches found in Japanese releases of Diamond and Pearl.24 The glitches lead to players being stuck in a wall in-game and as a result, possibly losing saved data. Nintendo has officially released patches to certain retailers in Japan to rectify these glitches.25
