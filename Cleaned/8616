The Bund der Asienk&lt;U+00E4&gt;mpfer (BdAK), more rarely mentioned as Bund Deutscher Asienk&lt;U+00E4&gt;mpfer (BDAK), meaning &quot;League of Asian Warriors&quot; or &quot;League of German Asian Warriors&quot;, was a social welfare organization for German veterans who had been in the Asien-Korps, the units of the German Empire at the service of the Ottoman Empire in the Near East and the Balkans during World War I.
The BdAK was established in 1918, at the end of the war, by German ex-armymen. One of their main purposes was to investigate what had happened to entire missing German units of the Asien-Korps, including German nurses (German Red Cross Sisters), when the Palestine-Transjordan front collapsed at the end of September 1918. At that time many Germans fighting along Turkish troops in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign suddenly found themselves behind enemy lines, fighting for their lives.
This association issued a magazine, the &quot;Orient Rundschau,&quot; during its heyday, which was during the 1920s, until well into the Nazi time. In the name of Gleichschaltung, the Bund der Asienk&lt;U+00E4&gt;mpfer was affiliated to the NSDAP after the Nazi takeover of power in 1933. It was finally disbanded by the Nazi authorities in 1938.
