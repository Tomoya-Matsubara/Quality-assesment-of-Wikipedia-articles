Delhi (,  ), known locally as Dilli (, ,  ), and also by the official name National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), is the second-largest metropolis in India. With over 15.9 million residents, it is the eighth largest metropolis in the world by population.1 The name Delhi is often also used to include some urban areas near the NCT, as well as to refer to New Delhi, the capital of India, which lies within the NCT. The NCT is a federally administered union territory.
Located on the banks of the River Yamuna, Delhi has been continuously inhabited since at least the 6th century BC.2 After the rise of the Delhi Sultanate, Delhi emerged as a major political, cultural and commercial city along the trade routes between northwest India and the Indo-Gangetic plains.34 It is the site of many ancient and medieval monuments, archaeological sites and remains. In 1639, Mughal emperor Shahjahan built a new walled city in Delhi which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1649 to 1857.56
After the British East India Company gained control of much of India during the 18th and 19th centuries, Calcutta became the capital both under Company rule and under the British Raj, until George V announced in 1911 that it was to move back to Delhi. A new capital city, New Delhi, was built to the south of the old city during the 1920s.7 When India gained independence from British rule in 1947, New Delhi was declared its capital and seat of government. As such, New Delhi houses important offices of the federal government, including the Parliament of India.
Owing to the migration of people from across the country, Delhi has grown to be a cosmopolitan metropolis. Its rapid development and urbanisation, coupled with the relatively high average income of its population, has transformed Delhi.8 Today Delhi is a major cultural, political, and commercial center of India.
Etymology
The etymology of &quot;Delhi&quot; is uncertain but many possibilities exist. The most common view is that its eponym is Dhillu or Dilu, a king of the Mauryan dynasty, who built the city in 50 BC and named it after himself.91011 The Hindi/Prakrit word dhili (&quot;loose&quot;) was used by the Tuar Rajputs to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar built by Raja Dhava had a weak foundation and was replaced.12 The coins in circulation in the region under the Rajputs were called dehliwal.13 Some other historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a corruption of dehleez or dehali&lt;U+2014&gt;Hindi for 'threshold'&lt;U+2014&gt;and symbolic of city as a gateway to the Indo-Gangetic Plains.14 Another theory suggests that the city's original name was Dhillika.15
History
   Human habitation was probably present in and around Delhi during the second millennium BC and before,16 and continuous inhabitation has been evidenced since at least the 6th century BC.17 The city is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata.18 Settlements grew from the time of the Mauryan Empire (c. 300 BC).19 Remains of seven major cities have been discovered in Delhi. The Tomara dynasty founded the city of Lal Kot in 736 AD. The Chauhan Rajputs of Ajmer conquered Lal Kot in 1180 AD and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora. The Chauhan king Prithviraj III was defeated in 1192 by the Afghan Muhammad Ghori.20 In 1206, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, the first ruler of the Slave Dynasty established the Delhi Sultanate. Qutb-ud-din started the construction the Qutub Minar and Quwwat-al-Islam (might of Islam), the earliest extant mosque in India.2122 After the fall of the Slave dynasty, a succession of Turkic and Central Asian dynasties, the Khilji dynasty, the Tughluq dynasty, the Sayyid dynasty and the Lodhi dynasty held power in the late medieval period, and built a sequence of forts and townships that are part of the seven cities of Delhi.23 In 1398, Timur Lenk invaded India on the pretext that the Muslim sultans of Delhi were too lenient towards their Hindu subjects. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins.24 Delhi was a major centre of Sufism during the Sultanate period.25 In 1526, Zahiruddin Babur defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi, Agra and Lahore.26
The Mughal Empire ruled northern India for more than three centuries, with a five-year hiatus during Sher Shah Suri's reign in the mid-16th century.27 Mughal emperor Akbar shifted the capital from Agra to Delhi. Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name (Shahjahanabad), and is more commonly known as the &quot;Old City&quot; or &quot;Old Delhi&quot;. The old city served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638. Nader Shah defeated the Mughal army at the Battle of Karnal in 1739, and looted the city, carrying away many treasures, including the Peacock Throne.28 In 1761, Delhi was raided by Ahmed Shah Abdali after the Third battle of Panipat. At the Battle of Delhi on 11 September, 1803, General Lake's British forces defeated the Marathas.
Delhi came under direct British control after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.29 Shortly after the Rebellion, Calcutta was declared the capital of British India and Delhi was made a district province of the Punjab. In 1911, Delhi was declared the capital of British India and a new political and administrative capital was designed by a team of British architects led by Edwin Lutyens to house the government buildings. New Delhi, also known as Lutyens' Delhi, was officially declared as the seat of the Government of India and the capital of the republic after independence on 15 August, 1947. During the Partition of India thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from West Punjab and Sindh fled to Delhi while many Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan. Starting on October 31, 1984 three thousand Sikhs were by Hindu mobs killed during the four-day long 1984 anti-Sikh riots after Sikh body guards assassinated the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, in revenge for an assault on Sikhism's holiest shrine during Operation Blue Star.
Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues, contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.30
The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi.31 The Act gave Delhi its own legislative assembly, though with limited powers.32 In December 2001, the Parliament of India building in New Delhi was attacked by armed militants resulting in the death of six security personnel.33 India suspected the hand of Pakistan-based militant groups in the attacks resulting in a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries.34 Delhi again witnessed terrorist attacks in October 2005 and September 2008 resulting in the deaths of 6235 and 3036 civilians respectively.
Geography
The National Capital Territory of Delhi is spread over an area of  , of which  is designated rural, and  urban. Delhi has a maximum length of  and the maximum width of . There are three local bodies (statutory towns) namely, Municipal Corporation of Delhi (area is ), New Delhi Municipal Committee () and Delhi Cantonment Board ().37
Delhi is an expansive area, in its extremity it spans from Sarup Nagar in the north to Rajorki in the south. Najafghar is the furthest point west, and the river Yamuna is its (relatively conservative eastern extremity). The NCR encompasses points south and east of the said border, namely Noida and DLF. Oddly, the main expanse of Delhi does not follow a specific geographical features (for example, converse to London, which centered around the Thames, has its northern limit at its first Hill, Hampstead Heath, and its southern limit at the river, similarly its western limit is the bottom of a basin - Paddington) The main city area of Delhi does not end until Saket in the South, whilst the northern limit is easily the Connaught Place, and the western limit is easily the NH8 The terrain of Delhi is widely erratic. It changes from plain agricultural fields in the north, to dry, arid hills (an offshoot of the Aravalli Hills of Rajasthan) in the south. Their used to be large natural lakes in the southern part of the city, but most of them have dried up due to mining. The city is bordered by river Yamuna, that separates the, although there is a good connectivity between them, with a number of bridges and the Metro subway, areas east of the river are not in the City of Delhi. The entirety of the city, including New Delhi, lies west of the river. East of the river still continues the NCR, but is not Delhi.
Delhi is located at , and lies in northern India. It borders the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh on East and Haryana on West, North and South. Delhi lies almost entirely in the Gangetic plains. Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plain and the Delhi ridge. The low-lying Yamuna flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture. However, these plains are prone to recurrent floods. Reaching up to a height of 318 m (1,043 ft),38 the ridge forms the most dominating feature in this region. It originates from the Aravalli Range in the south and encircles the west, northeast and northwest parts of the city. Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. Another river called the Hindon River separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. Delhi falls under seismic zone-IV, making it vulnerable to major earthquakes. 39
Climate
Delhi has a continental climate with high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Summers are long, extremely hot, from early April to mid-October, with the monsoon season in between. They are dangerous, and have, in the recent past, taken a huge toll. Beginning of March sees a reversal in the direction of wind, from the north-western direction, to the south-western. These bring the hot waves from Rajasthan, carrying sand and are a characteristic of the Delhi summer. These are called  loo. The months of February to May see a time of hot, prickling heat, with highly oxidizing conditions. At the end of June, humidity increases, bringing some respite in fluctuating rains in the months of July to September. Winter starts in late October and peaks in January and is notorious for its heavy fog.40 Extreme temperatures range from &lt;U+2212&gt;0.6 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (30.9 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F) to .41 The annual mean temperature is 25 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (77 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F); monthly mean temperatures range from 13 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C to 32 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (56 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F to 90 &lt;U+00B0&gt;F).42 The average annual rainfall is approximately 714 mm (28.1 inches), most of which is during the monsoons in July and August.43 The average date of the advent of monsoon winds in Delhi is 29 June.44 
Civic administration
As of July 2007, the National Capital Territory of Delhi comprises nine districts, 27 tehsils, 59 census towns, 165 villages and three statutory towns the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD); the New Delhi Municipal Committee (NDMC); and the Delhi Cantonment Board (DCB).45 
The Delhi metropolitan area lies within the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). The NCT has three local municipal corporations: Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) and Delhi Cantonment Board. MCD is one of the largest municipal corporations in the world providing civic amenities to an estimated 13.78 million people.46 The capital of India, New Delhi, falls under the administration of NDMC. The chairperson of the NDMC is appointed by the Government of India in consultation with the Chief Minister of Delhi.
Delhi has four major satellite cities which lie outside the National Capital Territory of Delhi. These are Gurgaon and Faridabad (in Haryana), and NOIDA and Ghaziabad, in Uttar Pradesh. Delhi is divided into nine districts. Each district (division) is headed by a Deputy Commissioner and has three subdivisions. A Subdivision Magistrate heads each subdivision. All Deputy Commissioners report to the Divisional Commissioner. The District Administration of Delhi is the enforcing department for all kinds of State and Central Government policies and exercises supervisory powers over numerous other functionaries of the Government.
The Delhi High Court has jurisdiction over Delhi. Delhi also has lower courts: the Small Causes Court for civil cases, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. The Delhi Police, headed by the Police Commissioner, is one of the largest metropolitan police forces in the world.47 Delhi is administratively divided into nine police-zones, which are further subdivided into 95 local police stations.48
Government and politics
 Earlier known as a special union territory, the National Capital Territory of Delhi has its own Legislative Assembly, Lieutenant Governor, Council of Ministers and Chief Minister. The legislative assembly seats are filled by direct election from territorial constituencies in the NCT. However, the Union Government of India and the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi jointly administer New Delhi. New Delhi, a city in Delhi, is the seat of both the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the Government of India.
While services like transport and others are taken care of by the Delhi Govt., services such as the police are directly under the control of the Central Government. The legislative assembly was re-established in 1993 for the first time since 1956, with direct federal rule in the span. In addition, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) handles civic administration for the city as part of the Panchayati Raj act. New Delhi, an urban area in Delhi, is the seat of both the State Government of Delhi and the Government of India. The Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace) and the Supreme Court of India are located in New Delhi. There are 80 assembly constituencies and seven Lok Sabha (Indian parliament's lower house) constituencies in Delhi.4950
Delhi was a traditional stronghold of the Indian National Congress, also known as the Congress Party. In the 1990s the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the leadership of Madan Lal Khurana came into power. However in 1998, Congress regained power under Sheila Dixit, who is the incumbent Chief Minister. The Congress retained power in the Legislative Assembly in the 2003 and 2008 elections.
Economy
 With an estimated net State Domestic Product (FY 2007) of Rs. 1,182 billion (US$24.5 billion) in nominal terms and Rs. 3,364 billion (US$69.8 billion) in PPP terms,5152 Delhi is the largest commercial center in northern India.53 In 2007, Delhi had a per capita income of Rs. 66,728 (US$1,450) at current prices, the third highest in India after Chandigarh and Goa.54 The tertiary sector contributes 70.95% of Delhi's gross SDP followed by secondary and primary sectors with 25.2% and 3.85% contribution respectively.55 Delhi's workforce constitutes 32.82% of the population showing an increase of 52.52% between 1991 and 2001.56 Delhi's unemployment rate decreased from 12.57% in 1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2000 to 4.63% in 2003.57 In December 2004, 636,000 people were registered with various employment exchange programmes in Delhi.58
In 2001 the total workforce in all government (union and state) and quasi government sector was 620,000. In comparison, the organised private sector employed 219,000.59 Key service industries include information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism.60 Delhi's manufacturing industry has also grown considerably as many consumer goods industries have established manufacturing units and headquarters in and around Delhi. Delhi's large consumer market, coupled with the easy availability of skilled labour, has attracted foreign investment in Delhi. In 2001, the manufacturing sector employed 1,440,000 workers while the number of industrial units was 129,000.61 Construction, power, telecommunications, health and community services, and real estate form integral parts of Delhi's economy. Delhi has India's largest and one of the fastest growing retail industries.62 As a result, land prices are booming and Delhi is currently ranked the 7th most expensive office hotspot in the world, with prices at $145.16 per square foot.63 As in the rest of India, the fast growth of retail is expected to affect the traditional unorganized retail trading system.64
Utility services
 The water supply in Delhi is managed by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). As of 2006, it supplied 650 MGD (million gallons per day) of water, while the water demand for 2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06 was estimated to be 963 MGD.65 The rest of the demand is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240 MGD, the Bhakra storage is the largest water source for DJB, followed by river Yamuna and Ganges.66 With falling groundwater level and rising population density, Delhi faces severely acute water shortage. Delhi daily produces 8000 tonnes of solid wastes which is dumped at three landfill sites by MCD.67 The daily domestic waste water production is 470 MGD and industrial waste water is 70 MGD.68 A large portion of the sewerage flows untreated into the river Yamuna.69
The city's per capita electricity consumption is about 1,265 kWh but actual demand is much more.70 In 1997, Delhi Vidyut Board (DVB) replaced Delhi Electric Supply Undertaking which was managed by the MCD. The DVB itself cannot generate adequate power to meet the city's demand and borrows power from India's Northern Region Grid. As a result, Delhi faces a power shortage resulting in frequent blackouts and brownouts, especially during the summer season when energy demand is at its peak. Several industrial units in Delhi rely on their own electrical generators to meet their electric demand and for back up during Delhi's frequent and disruptive power cuts. A few years ago, the power sector in Delhi was handed over to private companies. The distribution of electricity is carried out by companies run by Tata Power and Reliance Energy. The Delhi Fire Service runs 43 fire stations that attend about 15,000 fire and rescue calls per year.71
State-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) and private enterprises like Vodafone Essar, Airtel, Idea cellular, Reliance Infocomm, and Tata Indicom provide telephone and cell phone service to the city. In May 2008, Airtel alone had approximately 4 million cellular subscribers in Delhi.72 Cellular coverage is extensive, and both GSM and CDMA (from Reliance and Tata Indicom) services are available. Affordable broadband internet penetration is increasing in the city.73
Transport
   Public transport in Delhi is provided by buses, auto rickshaws and a Metro rail system.
Buses are the most popular means of transport catering to about 60% of the total demand.74 The state-owned Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is a major bus service provider for the city. The DTC operates the world's largest fleet of environment-friendly CNG buses.75 A Bus rapid transit network runs between Ambedkar Nagar and Delhi Gate.
The Delhi Metro, a mass rapid transit system built and operated by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), serves many parts of Delhi. As of 2007, the metro consists of three lines with a total length of 65 km (40 miles) and 59 stations while several other lines are under construction.76 Line 1 runs between Rithala and Shahdara, Line 2 runs underground between Jahangiri and the Central Secretariat and Line 3 runs between Indraprastha, Barakhamba Road, and Dwarka. Phase-II of the network is under construction and will have a total length of 128 km. It is expected to be completed by 2010.77 The Phase-I was built at a cost of US$2.3 billion and the Phase-II will cost an additional US$4.3 billion.78 Phase-III and IV will be completed by 2015 and 2020 respectively, creating a network spanning 413.8 km, longer than that of the London Underground.79
Auto rickshaws are a popular means of public transportation in Delhi, as they charge a lower fare than taxis. Most run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and are yellow and green in colour. Taxis are not an integral part of Delhi public transport, though they are easily available. Private operators operate most taxis, and most neighborhoods have a taxi stand from which taxis can be ordered or picked up. In addition, air-conditioned radio taxis, which can be ordered by calling a central number, have become increasingly popular, charging a flat rate of Rs. 15 per kilometer.
Delhi is a major junction in the rail map of India and is the headquarters of the Northern Railway. The four main railway stations are Old Delhi, Nizamuddin Railway Station, Sarai Rohilla and New Delhi Railway Station.80 Delhi is connected to other cities through many highways and expressways. Delhi currently has three expressways and three are under construction to connect it with its prosperous and commercial suburbs. The Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway connects Delhi with Gurgaon and the international airport. The DND Flyway and Noida-Greater Noida Expressway connect Delhi with two prosperous suburbs. Greater Noida is to have the new airport while Noida is to have the Indian Grand Prix.
Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) is situated in the southwestern corner of Delhi and serves as the main gateway for the city's domestic and international civilian air traffic. In 2006&lt;U+2013&gt;07, the airport recorded a traffic of more than 23 million passengers,8182 making it one of the busiest airports in South Asia. A new US$1.93 billion Terminal 3 is currently under construction and will handle an additional 34 million passengers annually by 2010.83 Further expansion programs will allow the airport to handle more than 100 million passengers per annum by 2020.84 Safdarjung Airport is the other airfield in Delhi used for general aviation purpose.85
Private vehicles account for 30% of the total demand for transport.86 At 1922.32 km of road length per 100 km&lt;U+00B2&gt;, Delhi has one of the highest road densities in India.87 Delhi is well connected to other parts of India by five National Highways: NH 1, 2, 8, 10 and 24. Roads in Delhi are maintained by MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi), NDMC, Delhi Cantonment Board, Public Works Department (PWD) and Delhi Development Authority.88
Delhi's high population growth rate, coupled with high economic growth rate has resulted in an ever increasing demand for transport creating excessive pressure on the city's existent transport infrastructure. As of 2008. Also, the number of vehicles in the metropolitan region, i.e., Delhi NCR (National Capital Region (India)) is 112 lakhs (11.2 million).89 In 2008, there were 85 cars in Delhi for every 1,000 of its residents.90 In order to meet the transport demand in Delhi, the State and Union government started the construction of a mass rapid transit system, including the Delhi Metro.91 In 1998, the Supreme Court of India ordered all public transport vehicles to use compressed natural gas (CNG) as fuel instead of diesel and other hydro-carbons.92

New Delhi houses several government buildings and official residences reminiscent of the British colonial architecture. Important structures include the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Secretariat, Rajpath, the Parliament of India and Vijay Chowk. Safdarjung's Tomb is an example of the Mughal gardens style
Delhi's association and geographic proximity to the capital, New Delhi, has amplified the importance of national events and holidays. National events such as Republic Day, Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti (Gandhi's birthday) are celebrated with great enthusiasm in Delhi. On India's Independence Day (15 August) the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation from the Red Fort. Most Delhiites celebrate the day by flying kites, which are considered a symbol of freedom.109 The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military might.110111. Over the centuries Delhi is known for its composite culture, and a festival that symbolizes it truly is the Phool Walon Ki Sair, which takes place each year in September, and where flowers and fans embroidered with flowers, pankha are offered to the shrine of 13th century Sufi saint, Khwaja Bakhtiyar Kaki, along with the Yogmaya Temple also situated in Mehrauli 112.

After completing the ten-year secondary phase of their education under the 10+2+3 plan, students typically spend the next two years either in junior colleges or in schools with senior secondary facilities, during which their studies become more focused. They select a stream of study&lt;U+2014&gt;liberal arts, commerce, science, or, less commonly, vocational. Upon completion, those who choose to continue, either study for a three-year undergraduate degree at a college, or a professional degree in law, engineering, or medicine. Notable higher education or research institutes in Delhi include All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Dr.Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital &amp; PGIMER, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi College of Engineering, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Faculty of Management Studies, Indian Law Institute, Delhi School of Economics, Indian Agricultural Research Institute and Indian Institute of Foreign Trade.

Radio is a less popular mass medium in Delhi, although FM radio has been gaining ground135 since the inauguration of several new FM channels in 2006.136 A number of state-owned and private radio stations broadcast from Delhi, including All India Radio (AIR), one of the world's largest radio service providers, which offers six radio channels in ten languages. Other city-based radio stations include Big FM (92.7 FM), Radio Mirchi (98.3 FM), Fever (104.0 FM), Radio One (94.3 FM), Red FM (93.5 FM), Radio City (91.1 FM), Hit 95 (95.0 FM) and Meow (104.8FM).

The Delhi cricket team represents the city in the Ranji Trophy, a domestic first-class cricket championship.138 The city is also home to the IPL team Delhi Daredevils, and ICL team Delhi Giants (earlier named Delhi Jets).
