 The Ranger SVG-770 was an air-cooled inverted Vee aero-engine developed by the Ranger Aircraft Engine Division of the Fairchild Engine &amp; Aircraft Corporation1.
Development &amp; Production
In 1931 the V-770 design was put to paper, based on the Ranger 6-440 series of inline aircooled engines, and test flown in the Vought XSO2U-1 Scout. In 1938 it was tested in the Curtiss SO3C Seamew and found to be unreliable with a tendency to overheat in low speed flight23. By 1941 a more developed V-770 was installed in the Fairchild XAT-14 Gunner prototype and found satisfactory for the production Fairchild AT-21 Gunner gunnery school aircraft4.
Produced from 1941-1945, the V-770 featured a two-piece aluminum alloy crankcase, steel barreled cylinders with integral aluminum alloy fins and aluminum alloy heads. The V-770 was one of very few V-type, in-line, air-cooled engines to reach production. The engine was used in a relatively small number of Army Air Forces aircraft, among them the Fairchild AT-21 twin-engine trainer of which approximately 175 were built.5
