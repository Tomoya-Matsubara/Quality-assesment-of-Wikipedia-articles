Writing and composition
When asked about the development of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, drummer Will Champion said: &quot;We were in a studio in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a harpsichord almost. And so we wanted to use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.&quot;23
In an interview with Q magazine, when asked about why &quot;Lovers in Japan&quot; had a hidden track, Guy Berryman explained that the band could not make up their minds, because they had discussed that they did not want an extra song on the album, and instead they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks.4 Champion followed with, &quot;We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it&lt;U+2019&gt;s the shortest. We wanted to make it almost impossible for you to not listen to it all in one go.&quot;5
The song's musicscape features an introductory detuned tack piano sound,6 then followed by an upbeat chiming guitar and soaring choruses.78 Towards the end, it builds into a rhythmically soaring, U2 sound.910 Martin sings about runners who must run until the race is won and soldiers who must soldier on in the second and third verse of the song.111213 Martin also sings about the sun coming out one day.14 The song also mentions of time being short.15

Critics were positive towards the song. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian review of the album, wrote: &quot;Chris Martin's melodies ... shine: even his loudest detractor could hardly deny his way with a tune as evidenced here by '42' and 'Lovers in Japan'.&quot;23 Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noted, &quot;On the stunning, jaw-dropping highlight 'Lovers in Japan', Martin pounds away at a bouncy toy-piano melody ... leading into a chorus where guitarist Jonny Buckland gets to unleash what might be the catchiest guitar riff he&lt;U+2019&gt;s written (and yes, he absolutely bathes in the moment).&quot;24 Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle added that &quot;Lovers in Japan&quot; was a &quot;joyous, romantic anthem that combines wistful rock riffs and gorgeous piano.&quot;25 He also wrote that the song is one of &quot;the disc's best moments&quot;.26 Josh Hathaway from The Plain Dealer wrote: &quot;'Lovers in Japan/Reign Of Love' works in just the opposite direction with 'Lovers' playing like an update of vintage Simple Minds, an almost anthem that never fully takes flight, before giving way to the gentle 'Reign of Love'.&quot;27
Music video
A music video for the single, directed by Mat Whitecross in London, was released on 31 October 2008 through iTunes Store, where it was available free for a week on iTunes US and iTunes Canada.28 The video utilises the &quot;Osaka Sun Mix&quot; version of the song.2930
The first half of the video shows the band playing in a courtyard while each member writes certain words from the lyrics in glowing neon on the screen. During the chorus, the camera spins around in circles to go along with the lines &quot;They are turning my head out&quot;.31 The video ends with butterfly-shaped confetti raining on the band, as happens when each chorus is played at live concerts.32
