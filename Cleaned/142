On 25 March 1799, French and Austrian armies fought for control of the geographically strategic Hegau in present day Baden-W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rttemberg. The battle has been called by various names: First Battle of Stockach, the Battle by Stockach, and, in French chronicles, the Battle of Liptingen (or Leibtengen). In the broader military context, this battle comprises a keystone in the first campaign in southwestern Germany during the Wars of the Second Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars.
It was the second battle between the French Army of the Danube, commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and the Habsburg Army under Archduke Charles; the armies had met a few days earlier, 20&lt;U+2013&gt;22 March, on the marshy fields southeast of Ostrach and the Pfullendorf heights. The Austrian Army's superior strength, almost three-to-one, forced the French to withdraw.
At Stockach, or Liptingen, both armies concentrated their forces into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles' personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, French were driven back upon the Rhine River.
Background
When the Revolution erupted in France in 1789, initially, the rulers of Europe, such Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed it as a problem between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As the rhetoric grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to watch these events with alarm. In 1791, the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold, who had succeeded Joseph a year earlier, saw the situation surrounding his sister Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, and her children with increasing alarm. As the revolution grew more politically radical, in the late summer of 1791, Leopold consulted with French &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt; nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia and issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they jointly declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.1
The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. Chief among these agitators were the Prince Cond&lt;U+00E9&gt;, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in the German city of Koblenz, immediately over the French border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army.2
On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria, the chief agitator and focal point of perceived aggression against the French state. In this War of the First Coalition (1792&lt;U+2013&gt;1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus the Kingdom of Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several initial victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Wurzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).3 This treaty proved difficult to administer. Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories. A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be mediatised to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses, but was unable to make any progress. Supported by French republican forces, Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings, ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war.4
Prelude to battle
As winter broke in 1799, on 1 March, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000,5 the so-called Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine between Basel and Kehl. This crossing officially violated the Treaty of Campo Formio.6
The Army of the Danube included:
Advance Guard, 9,000 men under General Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Joseph Lefebvre, which was under the temporary command of Dominique Vandamme. The Advance Guard crossed the Rhine on 2 March, marched through the Black Forest via the  Kinzig Valley, via first, Offenburg, and second Biberach, reaching Villingen by 4 March.
First Division, 8,000 men under General Pierre Marie Barth&lt;U+00E9&gt;lemy Ferino, constituted the right wing, crossed by Basil, and advanced on the north bank of the upper Rhine, through Schaffhausen and &lt;U+00DC&gt;berlingen.
Second Division, 7,000 men under General Joseph Souham, constituted the Center.
Third Division, 7,000 men under Laurent Saint-Cyr, constituted the left flank.
Left Wing, with 3,000 men, eventually under the command of Dominique Vandamme. Also called Danube Flanking Corps: Vandamme received command on 4 March, when Lefebvre recovered his health returned to command the advance guard. It consisted of 2 Light Infantry Regiments, commanded by generals of brigade Louis Fursy Compere and Henri Anton Jardon, and three squadrons of cavalry.7
Reserve, with 3,000 men under Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul.8
The French, meeting little resistance, advanced through the Black Forest in four columns, through the H&lt;U+00F6&gt;llental (H&lt;U+00F6&gt;lle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt, and at the southern end of the forest, along the Rhine bank. Although prudent counsel might have advised Jourdan to establish a position on the eastern slope of the mountains, he did not;9 instead he pushed across the Danube plain, taking up position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen.10
Engagement at Ostrach
The Army of the Danube advanced on Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper (southern) Swabia, and the latter a nearby village of 300 belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem, an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance. Jourdan's objective was simple and direct: cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition's use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe.11 Isolation of the two theaters would prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use these routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.12
Stretching between the Pfullendorf heights and the village lies a flat, wide plain, marshy in places, ringed with low-lying hills, and creased with a small tributary stream from which the village takes its name.13 Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain, but slightly south of the Danube itself. The two armies faced each other across this small valley and by 7 March, the first French forces arrived there.14 After an initial day-and-a-half of skirmishing, General Lefebvre informed Jourdan that the Austrians were attacking all his positions, and that the general engagement would begin shortly. After 24 hours of fighting, Austrian forces pushed Lefebvre and Saint Cyr's troops back to the Pfullendorf heights. Although sappers blew up the primary bridge over the Ostrach river, the Austrians managed to ford the stream anyway. They nearly outflanked General Saint Cyr's forces on the right flank, did outflank Lefebvre's forces in the center, and cut off a portion of the southern flank from the main body. Saint Cyr's troops barely managed to pull back before being fully cut off. Finally, General Hotze, marching north with 10,000 men, from Feldkirch prepared to attack Jourdan's army from the south. Jourdan withdrew, first to Messkirch and then to the Stockach and Engen area.15
Battle at Stockach and Engen
The day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days. The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but this time it was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Holtze had not yet caught up with him, he and his 10,000 men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.16
Dispositions
By 23 March, Jourdan had his headquarters in the vicinity of Stockach. He had recalled Ferino from the far right flank; Ferino had retreated along the coast of the &lt;U+00DC&gt;berlingen Lake, the northwestern finger of Lake Constance, to be in position at the close right flank, adjacent to Souham's division. Lefebvre, wounded at Ostrach, was still out of commission, and Saint Cyr had command of the left flank. When Jourdan considered his position, he felt it too extended, so he drew back further toward Engen. The first division camped near the Hohentweil, the 11th century fortress overlooking the marshes at the western-most point of the Lake Constance. The second division, the advanced guard, and a cavalry division were camped on the heights above Engen. The third division was camped by Leibtengen (Liptingen, the French called it), and Neuhausen. Vandamme had his small corps separated, but working into position behind the Austrian right flank. Jourdan made his headquarters at Engen.17 thumb|upright=2.0|alt=Map shows the disposition of troops around Engen and Stockach in southwestern Germany|French and Austrian troops concentrated their forces in the vicinity of Stockach on 25 March 1799. The plan was straightforward: Vandamme and Saint Cyr would make a simultaneous attack and Soult and Jourdan's main force would attack the center of the Austrian line. Jourdan's plan, to attack four points of the opposition simultaneously, seemed to him to be the only reasonable action against a force of such numerical superiority.18
The Habsburg Army included 17,000 men under the command of Fieldmarshal Nauendorf, formed into three columns and approaching from the north east. The main force, under the command of the Archduke Charles, included 53,000 men, also in three columns; in the main force, Charles had under his command the princes of Anhalt and F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg plus six battalions in a fourth column, north of the main column, but south of Nauendorf's command. An additional force of 13,000 troops under the command of Lieutenant Fieldmarshall Sztarry formed the southern flank.19
General engagement
The general engagement on 25 March was brutal and bloody.20 Before daybreak, at close to 0500, Saint Cyr opened by sending his forces in a headlong attack on the Austrian right, coordinated with Souham and Ferino's assault on the Austrian left. The ferocious attack forced the Austrians out of the woods in which they had been positioned overnight, and down the road to the village of Schwandorf. Fearing that his forces would shortly be flanked, Charles directed some reinforcements to back up General Meersfeld's troops. At this point, Vandamme's small corps, which had moved into position in the night of 24 March, attacked from the rear. Saint Cyr's forces had taken hold of the woods outside Stockach, named by the Austrians as the gruesome wood,21 with the conflict there described as &quot;obstinate and bloody.&quot;22 The Archduke himself dismounted from his horse and led eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into the fight.23 Both the Prince of Anhalt and Karl Aloys F&lt;U+00FC&gt;rstenberg were killed as they led their own columns into the engagement.24 Saint Cyr made no progress until Vandamme's assault, but both withered under the Archduke's response.25 In the melee, General LeGrand, of Saint Cyr's division, lost both his brother at his side, and his aide-de-camp, and Jourdan himself had barely escaped being trampled to death or captured, as he tried to rally his own troops.26 The main assault on the Austrian center was stalled by the superior numbers.27
At the French right flank, General Ferino attempted to push the Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods on both sides of the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to hold it in the night, and subsequently fell back.28
Withdrawal
On the evening of 26 March, Jourdan arranged for the abandonment of the positions in Engen and Stockach. By 31 March, the Army of the Danube established itself in Neustadt, Freiburg im Breisgau, Freudenstadt and Schiltach. Jourdan set up his command headquarters at Hornberg. The cavalry could not find forage in the mountains, and were sent to Offenberg.29
Aftermath
Jourdan later claimed that the Austrians had lost 7,000 killed or wounded, plus another 4,000  prisoners, and several cannons and had been forced to relinquish their positions in Stockach. For the whole day of the general engagement, the French had remained on the field of battle without meat, bread or brandy, and their animals had been without forage: &quot;it is impossible to deny,&quot; Jourdan wrote later, &quot;without the most glaring injustice or falsehood, that we gained a victory.&quot;30
In mid April, suffering from an arthritic complaint, Jourdan handed over command to his chief of staff, Ernouf, and retired to Paris.31 He told the Directory that he was ill, and offered his resignation, which, on the basis of the performance of the forces under his command, they accepted.32
