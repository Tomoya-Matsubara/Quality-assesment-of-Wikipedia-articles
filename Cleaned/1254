Passover (Hebrew, Yiddish: &lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05B6&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05B7&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt; Pesach, Tiberian: , Modern Hebrew: /&lt;U+02C8&gt;pesa&lt;U+03C7&gt;/ Pesah, Pesakh, Yiddish: Peysekh, Paysakh, Paysokh) is a Jewish holiday and festival. It commemorates the story of the Exodus, in which the ancient Israelites were freed from slavery in Egypt. Passover begins on the 15th day of the month of Nisan in the Jewish calendar, which is in spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and is celebrated for seven or eight days. It is one of the most widely observed Jewish holidays.
In the narrative of the Exodus, the Bible tells that God helped the Children of Israel escape slavery in Egypt by inflicting ten plagues upon the Egyptians before the Pharaoh would release his Israelite slaves; the tenth and worst of the plagues was the slaughter of the first-born. The Israelites were instructed to mark the doorposts of their homes with the blood of a spring lamb and, upon seeing this, the spirit of the Lord passed over these homes, an easy way to remember the holiday. There is some debate over where the term is actually derived from.1 When the Pharaoh freed the Israelites, it is said that they left in such a hurry that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the duration of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason it is called &quot;The Festival of the Unleavened Bread&quot;.2 Matzo (flat unleavened bread) is a symbol of the holiday.
Together with Shavuot (&quot;Pentecost&quot;) and Sukkot (&quot;Tabernacles&quot;), Passover is one of the three pilgrimage festivals (Shlosha Regalim) during which the entire Jewish populace historically made a pilgrimage to the Temple in Jerusalem.3 Samaritans still make this pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim, but only men participate in public worship.45
The Christian feast of Maundy Thursday finds its roots in the Jewish feast of Passover, the night on which the Last Supper occurred.6
Date and duration
Passover begins on the 15th day of the month of Nisan, which typically falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. Passover is a spring festival, so the 14th day of Nisan begins on the night of a full moon after the northern vernal equinox. To ensure that Passover did not start before spring, the tradition in ancient Israel held that the first day of Nisan would not start until the barley was ripe, being the test for the onset of spring.7 If the barley was not ripe, or various other phenomena8 indicated that spring was not yet imminent, an intercalary month (Adar II) would be added. However, since at least the 4th century, the date has been fixed mathematically.9
In Israel, Passover is the seven-day holiday of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, with the first and last days observed as legal holidays and as holy days involving abstention from work, special prayer services, and holiday meals; the intervening days are known as Chol HaMoed (&quot;Weekdays of the Festival&quot;). Diaspora Jews historically observed the festival for eight days, and most still do. Reform and Reconstructionist Jews and Israeli Jews, wherever they are, usually observe the holiday over seven days. The reason for this extra day is due to enactment of the Sages. It is thought by many scholars that Jews outside of Israel could not be certain if their local calendars fully conformed to practice of the Temple at Jerusalem, so they added an extra day. But as this practice only attaches to certain (major) sacred days, others posit the extra day may have been added to accommodate people who had to travel long distances to participate in communal worship and ritual practices; or the practice may have evolved as a compromise between conflicting interpretations of Jewish Law regarding the calendar; or it may have evolved as a safety measure in areas where Jews were commonly in danger, so that their enemies would not be certain on which day to attack.10
Karaite Jews and Samaritans use different versions of the Jewish calendar, which are often out of sync with the modern Jewish calendar by one or two days. In 2009, for example, Nisan 15 on the Jewish calendar used by Rabbinical Judaism corresponds to April 9. On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six day Festival of Unleavened Bread &lt;U+2013&gt; for a total of seven days.
According to Exodus 12:3 the Passover lamb must be separated on the &quot;10th day of the Month&quot; therefore, a full cycle of the moon must be observed to determine when to hold the Passover. It cannot merely be held on the first full moon after the Spring Equinox. It must be observed after the first New Moon after the Equinox, then count 10 days, and 14th, and 15th, then always the Passover falls on the Full Moon.
Biblical origin
 Called the feast of unleavened bread (Hebrew ''hag hamatzot '') in the Hebrew Bible, the commandment to keep Passover is recorded in the Book of Leviticus:
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month between the two evenings is the lord's Passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the lord; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the lord seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work. ()
The biblical regulations for the observance of the festival require that all leavening be disposed of before the beginning of the 15th of Nisan() An unblemished lamb or goat is to be set apart on Nisan 10,() and slaughtered on Nisan 14 &quot;between the two evenings&quot;,11 a phrase which is, however, not defined. It is then to be eaten &quot;that night&quot;, Nisan 15,12 roasted, without the removal of its internal organs13 with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.14 Nothing of the sacrifice on which the sun rises may be eaten, but must be burned.15 The sacrifices may only be performed in a specific place prescribed by God (for Judaism, Jerusalem, and for Samaritans, Mount Gerizim).16
The biblical regulations pertaining to the original Passover also include how the meal is to be eaten: &quot;with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the 's passover&quot; (Exodus 12:11).
Some of these details can be corroborated, and to some extent amplified, in extrabiblical sources. The removal (or &quot;sealing up&quot;) of the leaven is referred to in the Elephantine papyri, an Aramaic papyrus from 5th century BCE Elephantine in Egypt.17 The slaughter of the lambs on the 14th is mentioned in The Book of Jubilees, a Jewish work of the Ptolemaic period, and by the Herodian-era writers Josephus and Philo. These sources also indicate that &quot;between the two evenings&quot; was taken to mean the afternoon.18 Jubilees states the sacrifice was eaten that night,19 and together with Josephus states that nothing of the sacrifice was allowed to remain until morning.20 Philo states that the banquet included hymns and prayers.21
The Biblical commandments concerning the Passover (and the Feast of Unleavened Bread) stress the importance of remembering: And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt; and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.&quot; ()  commands, in reference to God's sparing of the firstborn from the Tenth Plague: And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord; throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.  repeats the command to remember:Remember this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, for by strength the hand of the  brought you out from this place.
Etymology
The verb &quot;pas&lt;U+00E0&gt;ch&quot; () is first mentioned in the Torah account of the Exodus from Egypt (), and there is some debate about its exact meaning: the commonly held assumption that it means &quot;He passed over&quot;, in reference to God &quot;passing over&quot; the houses of the Hebrews during the final of the Ten Plagues of Egypt, stems from the translation provided in the Septuagint (&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03BB&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C5&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt; in , and &lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03BA&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03C0&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C3&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt; in ). Judging from other instances of the verb, and instances of parallelism, a more faithful translation may be &quot;he hovered over, guarding.&quot; Indeed, this is the image invoked by the verb in Isaiah 31:5: &quot;As birds hovering, so will the lord of hosts protect Jerusalem; He will deliver it as He protecteth it, He will rescue it as He passeth over&quot; (&lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05B3&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt; &lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;â€”&lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05B5&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05D2&gt;&lt;U+05B5&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt; &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05EA&gt;, &lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05B7&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;-&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05C1&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05DD&gt;; &lt;U+05D2&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05DF&gt; &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;, &lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05B8&gt;&lt;U+05BC&gt;&lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05B9&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05B7&gt; &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05B0&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05B4&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D8&gt;.) () Both meanings become apparent in Exodus 12:23 when parsed as: the Lord will pass (hover, guard) over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer (destroying angel is commanded to pass by the children of Israel) to come in unto your houses to smite. Targum Onkelos translates pesach as &quot;he had pity&quot;, The English term &quot;Passover&quot; is first known recorded in the English language in William Tyndale's translation of the Bible, later appearing in the King James Version as well.
The term Pesach () may also refer to the lamb or goat which was designated as the Passover sacrifice (called the Korban Pesach in Hebrew). Four days before the Exodus, the Hebrews were commanded to set aside a lamb.() and inspect it daily for blemishes. During the day on the 14th of Nisan, they were to slaughter the animal and use its blood to mark their lintels and door posts. Up until midnight on the 15th of Nisan, they were to consume the lamb. Each family (or group of families) gathered together to eat a meal that included the meat of the Korban Pesach while the Tenth Plague ravaged Egypt.
In subsequent years, during the existence of the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem, the Passover offering (Hebrew korban Pesach) was eaten during the Passover Seder on the 15th of Nisan. However, following the destruction of the Temple, no sacrifices may be offered or eaten. The Seder Korban Pesach, a set of scriptural and Rabbinic passages dealing with the Passover sacrifice, is customarily recited during or after the Mincha (afternoon prayer) service on the 14th on Nisan.22 The story of the Korban Pesach is also retold at the Passover Seder,meaning order, and the symbolic food which represents it on the Seder Plate is usually a roasted lamb shankbone or chicken wing.
Passover offering, korban Pesach
When the Temple in Jerusalem was standing, the focus of the Passover festival was the Passover sacrifice (Hebrew korban Pesach) also known as the &quot;Paschal Lamb&quot;). Every family large enough to completely consume a young lamb or wild goat was required to offer one for sacrifice at the Jewish Temple on the afternoon of the 14th day of Nisan,() and eat it that night, which was the 15th of Nisan (). If the family was too small to finish eating the entire offering in one sitting, an offering was made for a group of families. The sacrifice could not be offered with anything leavened,() and had to be roasted, without its head, feet, or inner organs being removed () and eaten together with unleavened bread (matzo) and bitter herbs (maror) ( One had to be careful not to break any bones from the offering, () and none of the meat could be left over by morning ().
Because of the Passover sacrifice's status as a sacred offering, the only people allowed to eat it were those who had the obligation to bring the offering. Among those who could not offer or eat the Passover lamb were: An apostate (), a servant (), an uncircumcised man (), a person in a state of ritual impurity, except when a majority of Jews are in such a state (Pesahim 66b), and a non-Jew. The offering had to be made before a quorum of 30 (Pesahim 64b). In the Temple, the Levites sang Hallel while the priests performed the sacrificial service. Men and women were equally obligated regarding the offering (Pesahim 91b).
Women were obligated, as men, to perform the Korban Pesach and to participate in a Seder.
Today
Today, in the absence of the Temple, the mitzvah of the Korban Pesach is memorialized in the Seder Korban Pesach23, recited in the afternoon of Nisan 14, and in the form of symbolic food placed on the Passover Seder Plate, which is usually a roasted shankbone. The eating of the afikoman substitutes for the eating of the Korban Pesach at the end of the Seder meal (Mishnah Pesachim 119a). Many Sephardi Jews have the custom of eating lamb or goat meat during the Seder in memory of the Korban Pesach.
Removing all chametz
 Chametz (&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05E5&gt;, &quot;leavening&quot;) is something that is both made from one of five types of grains, and has been combined with water and left to stand raw for longer than eighteen minutes. The consumption, keeping, and owning of chametz is forbidden during Passover. Yeast and fermentation are not themselves forbidden as seen for example by wine, which is required, rather than merely permitted. According to Halakha, the ownership of such chametz is also proscribed.
Chametz does not include baking soda, baking powder or like products. Although these are defined in English as leavening agents, they leaven by chemical reaction, not by biological fermentation. Thus, bagels, waffles and pancakes made with baking soda and matzo meal are considered permissible, while bagels made with sourdough and pancakes and waffles made with yeast are prohibited.
The Torah commandments regarding chametz are:
To remove all chametz from one's home, including things made with chametz, before the first day of Passover. (). It may be simply used up, thrown out (historically, destroyed by burning), or given or sold to non-Jews (or non-Samaritans, as the case may be).
To refrain from eating chametz or mixtures containing chametz during Passover. (, , ).
Not to possess chametz in one's domain (i.e. home, office, car, etc.) during Passover (, ).
Observant Jews spend the weeks before Passover in a flurry of thorough housecleaning, to remove every morsel of chametz from every part of the home. Jewish law requires the elimination of olive-sized or larger quantities of leavening from one's possession, but most housekeeping goes beyond this. Even the cracks of kitchen counters are thoroughly scrubbed, for example, to remove any traces of flour and yeast, however small. Any item or implement that has handled chametz is generally put away and not used during Passover.24
Some hotels, resorts, and even cruise ships across America, Europe and Israel also undergo a thorough housecleaning to make their premises &quot;kosher for Pesach&quot; to cater to observant Jews.
Search for, and burning of leaven
Traditionally, Jews do a formal search for remaining leaven (Hebrew chametz, as in bedikat chametz) after nightfall on the evening before Passover. A blessing is read (&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt; &lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05E5&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; al biyur chametz, &quot;on the removal of leaven&quot;), and one or more members of the household proceed from room to room to check that no crumbs remain in any corner. In very traditional families, the search may be conducted by the head of the household; in more modern-style families, the children may be the ones who do the search, under the supervision of their parents.
It is customary to turn off the lights and conduct the search by candlelight, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects the crumbs can be burned the next day with the chametz. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle. Because the house is assumed to have been thoroughly cleaned by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for chametz will be for naught (bracha l'vatala) if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread smaller than the size of an olive are traditionally hidden throughout the house in order to ensure that some chametz will be found.
On the morning of the 14th of Nisan, any leavened products that remain in the householder's possession, along with the 10 morsels of bread from the previous night's search, are burned (s'rayfat chametz). The head of the household repeats the declaration of biyur chametz, declaring any chametz that may not have been found to be null and void &quot;as the dust of the earth&quot;. Should more chametz actually be found in the house during the Passover holiday, it must be burnt as soon as possible.
Unlike chametz, which can be eaten any day of the year except during Passover, kosher for Passover foods can be eaten year-round. They need not be burnt or otherwise discarded after the holiday ends. The sole exception is the historic sacrificial lamb, which is never part of the modern Jewish holiday but is still a principal feature of Falashah, Karaite and Samaritan observance. The meat of this lamb, which is slaughtered and cooked on the evening of Passover, must be completely consumed before the morning.()
Sale of chametz
Chametz may be sold rather than discarded, especially in the case of relatively valuable forms such as liquor distilled from wheat, with the products being repurchased afterward. In some cases, they may never leave the house, instead being formally sold while remaining in the original owner's possession in a locked cabinet until they can be repurchased after the holiday. Modern observance may also include sealing cabinets and drawers which contain &quot;Chametz&quot; shut by using adhesive tape, which serves a similar purpose to a lock but also shows evidence of tampering. Although the practice of selling &quot;Chametz&quot; dates back many years, some contemporary rabbinical authorities have come to regard it with disdain &lt;U+2013&gt; since the supposed &quot;new owner&quot; never takes actual possession of the goods.
The sale of chametz may also be conducted communally via a rabbi, who becomes the &quot;agent&quot; for all the community's Jews through a halakhic procedure called a kinyan (acquisition). Each householder must put aside all the chametz he is selling into a box or cupboard, and the rabbi enters into a contract to sell all the chametz to a non-Jew (who is not obligated to observe the commandments) in exchange for a small down payment (e.g. $1.00), with the remainder due after Passover. This sale is considered completely binding according to Halakha, and at any time during the holiday, the buyer may come to take or partake of his property. The rabbi then re-purchases the goods for less than they were sold at the end of the holiday.25
Separate dishes
Due to the Torah injunction not to eat chametz during Passover, observant families typically own complete sets of serving dishes, glassware and silverware (and in some cases, even separate dishwashers and sinks) which have never come into contact with chametz, for use only during Passover. Under certain circumstances, some chametz utensils can be immersed in boiling water (hagalat keilim) to purge them of any traces of chametz that may have accumulated during the year. Many Sephardic families thoroughly wash their year-round glassware and then use it for Passover, as the Sephardic position is that glass does not absorb enough traces of food to present a problem. Similarly, ovens may be used for Passover either by setting the self-cleaning function to the highest degree for a certain period of time, or by applying a blow torch to the interior until the oven glows red hot (a process called libun gamur).26
Matzo
Matzah
A symbol of the Passover holiday is matzo, an unleavened flatbread made solely from flour and water which is continually worked from mixing through baking, so that it is not allowed to rise. Matzo may be made by machine or by hand; the latter type of matzo, called shmura matzo (&quot;watched&quot; or &quot;guarded&quot; matzo), is the bread of preference for the Passover Seder in Orthodox Jewish communities. The Torah contains a Divine commandment to eat matzo, specifically, on the first night of Passover and to eat only unleavened bread (in practice, matzo) during the entire week of Passover.27 Consequently the eating of matzo figures prominently in the Passover Seder. There are several explanations for this.
The Torah says that it is because the Hebrews left Egypt with such haste that there was no time to allow baked bread to rise; thus flat, unleavened bread, matzo, is a reminder of the rapid departure of the Exodus.28 Other scholars teach that in the time of the Exodus, matzo was commonly baked for the purpose of traveling because it preserved well and was light to carry (making it similar to hardtack), suggesting that matzo was baked intentionally for the long journey ahead.
Matzo has also been called Lechem Oni (Hebrew: &quot;bread of poverty&quot;). There is an attendant explanation that matzo serves as a symbol to remind Jews what it is like to be a poor slave and to promote humility, appreciate freedom, and avoid the inflated ego symbolized by more luxurious leavened bread.29
In the weeks before Passover, matzos are prepared for holiday consumption. In Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups (&quot;chaburas&quot;) to bake a special version of handmade matzo called &quot;shmura matzo&quot;, or &quot;guarded matzo&quot;, for use at the Seder. These are made from wheat that is guarded from contamination by chametz from the time of summer harvest to its baking into matzos five to ten months later.30 Shmura matzo dough is rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. Chaburas also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically square-shaped matzo sold in stores.
The baking of shmura matzo is labor-intensive, as only 18&lt;U+2013&gt;22 minutes is permitted between the mixing of flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven; however, most are completed within 5 minutes of being kneaded.31 Consequently, only a small number of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up;32 this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.
After the matzos come out of the oven, the entire work area is scrubbed down and swept to make sure that no pieces of old, potentially leavened dough remain, as any stray pieces are now chametz, and can contaminate the next batch of matzo.
Fast of the Firstborn
On the morning of the Passover seder, firstborn sons are commanded to observe the Fast of the Firstborn which commemorates the salvation of the Hebrew firstborns. According to Exodus (12:29), God struck down all Egyptian firstborns while the Israelites were not affected. However, it is customary for synagogues to conduct a siyum (ceremony marking the completion of a section of Torah learning) right after morning prayers, and the celebratory meal that follows cancels the firstborn's obligation to fast.
Passover seder
  It is traditional for Jewish families to gather on the first night of Passover (first two nights in communities outside the land of Israel) for a special dinner called a seder (&lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;â€”derived from the Hebrew word for &quot;order&quot;, referring to the very specific order of the ritual). The table is set with the finest china and silverware to reflect the importance of the meal. During this meal, the story of the Exodus from Egypt is retold using a special text called the Haggadah. Four cups of wine are consumed at various stages in the narrative. The Haggadah divides the night's procedure into 15 parts:
Kadeish &lt;U+05E7&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05E9&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; recital of Kiddush blessing and drinking of the first cup of wine
Urchatz &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05E5&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; the washing of the hands &lt;U+2013&gt; without blessing
Karpas &lt;U+05DB&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05E1&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; dipping of the karpas in salt water
Yachatz &lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05E5&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; breaking the middle matzo; the larger piece becomes the afikoman which is eaten later during the ritual of Tzafun
Maggid &lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D2&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; retelling the Passover story, including the recital of &quot;the four questions&quot; and drinking of the second cup of wine
Rachtzah &lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt;&lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; second washing of the hands &lt;U+2013&gt; with blessing
Motzi &lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05D0&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; traditional blessing before eating bread products

Hallel &lt;U+05D4&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; recital of the Hallel, traditionally recited on festivals; drinking of the fourth cup of wine
Nirtzah &lt;U+05E0&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05E6&gt;&lt;U+05D4&gt; &lt;U+2013&gt; conclusion
These 15 parts parallel the 15 steps in the Temple in Jerusalem on which the Levites stood during Temple services, and which were memorialized in the 15 Psalms (#120-134) known as Shir HaMa'alot (, &quot;Songs of Ascent&quot;).33
The seder is replete with questions, answers, and unusual practices (e.g. the recital of Kiddush which is not immediately followed by the blessing over bread, which is the traditional procedure for all other holiday meals) to arouse the interest and curiosity of the children at the table. The children are also rewarded with nuts and candies when they ask questions and participate in the discussion of the Exodus and its aftermath. Likewise, they are encouraged to search for the afikoman, the piece of matzo which is the last thing eaten at the seder. Audience participation and interaction is the rule, and many families' seders last long into the night with animated discussions and much singing. The seder concludes with additional songs of praise and faith printed in the Haggadah, including Chad Gadya (&quot;One Little Kid&quot; or &quot;One Little Goat&quot;).
Maror
 Maror symbolizes the bitterness of slavery in Egypt. The following verse from the Torah underscores that symbolism: &quot;And they embittered (ve-yimareru &lt;U+05D5&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05DE&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;&lt;U+05D5&gt;) their lives with hard labor, with mortar and with bricks and with all manner of labor in the field; any labor that they made them do was with hard labor&quot; (Exodus 1:14).
Silver seder plate
Four cups of wine
There is a Rabbinic requirement that four cups of wine are to be drunk during the seder meal. This applies to both men and women. The Mishnah says (Pes. 10:1) that even the poorest man in Israel has an obligation to drink. Each cup is connected to a different part of the seder: the first cup is for Kiddush, the second cup is connected with the recounting of the Exodus, the drinking of the third cup concludes Birkat Hamazon and the fourth cup is associated with Hallel.
Participation of children
The four questions
Children have a very important role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are:
Why is this night different from all other nights?
On all other nights, we eat either unleavened or leavened bread, but tonight we eat only unleavened bread?
On all other nights, we eat all kinds of vegetables, but tonight, we eat only bitter herbs?
On all other nights, we do not dip [our food] even once, but tonight we dip twice?
On all other nights, we eat either sitting or reclining, but tonight we only recline?
Often the leader of the seder and the other adults at the meal will use prompted responses from the Haggadah, which states, &quot;The more one talks about the Exodus from Egypt, the more praiseworthy he is.&quot; Many readings, prayers, and stories are used to recount the story of the Exodus. Many households add their own commentary and interpretation and often the story of the Jews is related to the theme of liberation and its implications worldwide.
Afikoman
 The afikoman â€” an integral part of the Seder itself â€” is used to engage the interest and excitement of the children at the table. During the fourth part of the Seder, called Yachatz, the leader breaks the middle piece of matzo into two. He sets aside the larger portion as the afikoman. Many families use the afikoman as a device for keeping the children awake and alert throughout the Seder proceedings by hiding the afikoman and offering a prize for its return. Alternatively, the children are allowed to &quot;steal&quot; the afikoman and demand a reward for its return. In either case, the afikoman must be consumed during the twelfth part of the Seder, Tzafun.
Concluding songs
After the Hallel, the fourth glass of wine is drunk, and participants recite a prayer that ends in &quot;Next year in Jerusalem!&quot;. This is followed by several lyric prayers that expound upon God's mercy and kindness, and give thanks for the survival of the Jewish people through a history of exile and hardship. &quot;Echad Mi Yodea&quot; (&quot;Who Knows One?&quot;) is a playful song, testing the general knowledge of the children (and the adults). Some of these songs, such as &quot;Chad Gadiyah&quot; are allegorical.
Hol Hamoed
In Israel, Passover lasts for seven days with the first and last days being major Jewish holidays. In Orthodox and Conservative communities, no work is performed on those days, with most of the rules relating to the observances of Shabbat being applied. A seder is held on the first day.
Outside Israel, in Orthodox and Conservative communities, the holiday lasts for eight days with the first two days and last two days being major holidays. A seder is conducted twice, on both the first and second days. In the intermediate days necessary work can be performed. Reform Judaism observes Passover over seven days, with the first and last days being a major holidays. The Seder is held on the first day.
Like the holiday of Sukkot, the intermediary days of Passover are known as Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. It is a time for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies.
Passover cake recipes call for potato starch or Passover cake flour made from finely granulated matzo instead of regular flour, and a large amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use matzo farfel (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For families with Eastern European backgrounds, borsht, a soup made with beets, is a Passover tradition.  While kosher for Passover packaged goods are available in stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week. In Israel, families that do not kasher their ovens can bake cakes, casseroles, and even meat34 on the stovetop in a Wonder Pot, an Israeli invention consisting of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a center hole which is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.35
Counting of the Omer
Beginning on the second night of Passover, the 16th day of Nisan,36 Jews begin the practice of the Counting of the Omer, a nightly reminder of the approach of the holiday of Shavuot 50 days hence. Each night after the evening prayer service, men and women recite a special blessing and then enumerate the day of the Omer. On the first night, for example, they say, &quot;Today is the first day in (or, to) the Omer&quot;; on the second night, &quot;Today is the second day in the Omer.&quot; The counting also involves weeks; thus, the seventh day is commemorated, &quot;Today is the seventh day, which is one week in the Omer.&quot; The eighth day is marked, &quot;Today is the eighth day, which is one week and one day in the Omer,&quot; etc.
When the Temple stood in Jerusalem, a sheaf of new-cut barley was presented before the altar on the second day of Unleavened Bread. Josephus writes
On the second day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the abundance of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley in the following way. After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an assaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest for the use of the priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest.37
Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.
One explanation for the Counting of the Omer is that it shows the connection between Passover and Shavuot. The physical freedom that the Hebrews achieved at the Exodus from Egypt was only the beginning of a process that climaxed with the spiritual freedom they gained at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Another explanation is that the newborn nation which emerged after the Exodus needed time to learn their new responsibilities vis-a-vis Torah and mitzvot before accepting God's law. The distinction between the Omer offeringâ€”a measure of barley, typically animal fodderâ€”and the Shavuot offeringâ€”two loaves of wheat bread, human foodâ€”symbolizes the transition process.
Seventh day of Passover
Shvi'i shel Pesach (&lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05D1&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt;&lt;U+05E2&gt;&lt;U+05D9&gt; &lt;U+05E9&gt;&lt;U+05DC&gt; &lt;U+05E4&gt;&lt;U+05E1&gt;&lt;U+05D7&gt; &quot;seventh [day] of Passover&quot;) is another full Jewish holiday, with special prayer services and festive meals. Outside the Land of Israel in the Jewish diaspora, Shvi'i shel Pesach is celebrated on both the seventh and eighth days of Passover. This holiday commemorates the day the Children of Israel reached the Red Sea and witnessed both the miraculous &quot;Splitting of the Sea,&quot; the drowning of all the Egyptian chariots, horses and soldiers that pursued them, and the Passage of the Red Sea. According to the Midrash, only the Pharaoh was spared to give testimony to the miracle that occurred.
Hasidic Rebbes traditionally hold a tish on the night of Shvi'i shel Pesach and place a cup or bowl of water on the table before them. They use this opportunity to speak about the Splitting of the Sea to their disciples, and sing songs of praise to God.
Second Passover
The &quot;Second Passover&quot; (Pesach Sheni) on the 14th of Iyar in the Hebrew Calendar is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (Numbers 9:6-13) as a make-up day for people who were unable to offer the pesach sacrifice at the appropriate time due to ritual impurity or distance from Jerusalem. Just as on the first Pesach night, breaking bones from the second Paschal offering (Numbers 9:12) or leaving meat over until morning (Numbers 9:12) is prohibited.
Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has the status of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it essentially does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.38
Traditional foods
 Because the house is free of chametz for eight days, the Jewish household typically eats different foods during the week of Passover. These include:
Matzah brei &lt;U+2013&gt; Softened matzo fried with egg and fat; served either savory or sweet
Matzo cereal &lt;U+2013&gt; Matzo meal boiled in water and often served with milk and butter
Matzo kugel &lt;U+2013&gt; A kugel made with matzo instead of noodles
Charoset &lt;U+2013&gt; Chopped or ground apples and nuts in wine
Chrain &lt;U+2013&gt; Horseradish and beet relish
Gefilte fish &lt;U+2013&gt; Poached fish patties or fish balls made from a mixture of ground deboned fish, mostly carp or pike
Chicken soup with matzah balls (kneydlach) &lt;U+2013&gt; Chicken soup served with matzo-meal dumplings
Rice, often with saffron or raisins &lt;U+2013&gt; Nearly all Sephardi Jews and many Mizrachi Jews consider rice to be an essential food for the Passover table; Ashkenazi Jews and Hasidic Jews do not eat rice during Passover as a matter of minhag. According to the Talmud39 and the commentary of Rashi, rice is not chametz. However, there is a concern that in storage, rice may have been contaminated with even one kernel of wheat or other grains. Those who eat rice inspect it carefully prior to cooking.
Sermons, liturgy, and song
The story of Passover, with its message that slaves can go free, and that the future can be better than the present, has inspired a number of religious sermons, prayers, and songs&lt;U+2014&gt;including spirituals (what used to be called &quot;Negro Spirituals&quot;), within the African-American community.
Rabbi Philip R. Alstat, an early leader of Conservative Judaism, known for his fiery rhetoric and powerful oratory skills, wrote and spoke in 1939 about the power of the Passover story during the rise of Nazi persecution and terror:40
Perhaps in our generation the counsel of our Talmudic sages may seem superfluous, for today the story of our enslavement in Egypt is kept alive not only by ritualistic symbolism, but even more so by tragic realism. We are the contemporaries and witnesses of its daily re-enactment. Are not our hapless brethren in the German Reich eating &quot;the bread of affliction&quot;? Are not their lives embittered by complete disenfranchisement and forced labor? Are they not lashed mercilessly by brutal taskmasters behind the walls of concentration camps? Are not many of their men-folk being murdered in cold blood? Is not the ruthlessness of the Egyptian Pharaoh surpassed by the sadism of the Nazi dictators?
And yet, even in this hour of disaster and degradation, it is still helpful to &quot;visualize oneself among those who had gone forth out of Egypt.&quot; It gives stability and equilibrium to the spirit. Only our estranged kinsmen, the assimilated, and the de-Judaized, go to pieces under the impact of the blow....But those who visualize themselves among the groups who have gone forth from the successive Egypts in our history never lose their sense of perspective, nor are they overwhelmed by confusion and despair.... It is this faith, born of racial experience and wisdom, which gives the oppressed the strength to outlive the oppressors and to endure until the day of ultimate triumph when we shall &quot;be brought forth from bondage unto freedom, from sorrow unto joy, from mourning unto festivity, from darkness unto great light, and from servitude unto redemption.
