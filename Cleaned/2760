 The 1977 Vrancea Earthquake occurred on Friday, 4 March 1977, 21:20 local time and was felt throughout the Balkans. It had a magnitude of 7.2 with an epicenter in Vrancea (in the Eastern Carpathians) at a depth of .
The earthquake killed about 1,578 people (1,424 in Bucharest) in Romania, and wounded more than 11,300.1 Among the victims was the Romanian actor Toma Caragiu. Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+0219&gt;escu suspended his official trip to Nigeria.
About 35,000 buildings were damaged, and the total damage was estimated at more than two billion dollars. Most of the damage was concentrated in Romania's capital, Bucharest, where about 33 large buildings collapsed. Most of those buildings were built before World War II, and were not reinforced. After the earthquake, the Romanian government imposed tougher construction standards.
In Bulgaria, the earthquake is known as the Vrancea Earthquake or Svishtov Earthquake. Three blocks of flats in the Bulgarian town of Svishtov (near Zimnicea) collapsed, killing more than 100 people. Many other buildings were damaged, including the Church of the Holy Trinity. In the Soviet Republic of Moldova the earthquake destroyed and damaged many buildings. In the capital Kishinev, a panic broke out.

Bucharest
A number of 32 buildings of 8&lt;U+2013&gt;12 storey collapsed in the central part of city, while about 150 old buildings of 4&lt;U+2013&gt;6 storey high were strongly damaged. Almost all the collapsed buildings had been built between 1920 and 1940 without earthquake resistant design.6 There was also the collapse of 3 public buildings (Ministry of Metallurgy, Faculty of Chemistry and Computer Centre) that due to the time of occurrence were not heavily occupied.7 On 5 March, the first toll of the disaster indicates 508 fatalities and 2,600 injuries.8 A final toll showed that 90% of the victims were from Bucharest: 1,424 deaths and 7,598 injuries.910
No critical fires occurred, but electrical power was lost in large areas of the city for about a day. Nine of 35 hospitals were evacuated.
Other Romanian cities
In the cities of Foc&lt;U+0219&gt;ani and Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u, unreinforced masonry walls in low-rise construction collapsed partially or totally, and there were signs of movement between structural elements and adjacent masonry in-fill walls in recently constructed engineered buildings.
The city of Zimnicea was reported in ruins: 175 houses collapsed, while 523 sustained serious damage, 4,000 people were displaced, and there were hundreds of victims.11 Inasmuch as 80% of the city was destroyed, Zimnicea was rebuilt from the ground.12 In Craiova, more than 550 buildings were severely damaged, among them the Museum of Art, the Oltenia Museum, the University and the County Library. Initial estimates indicate a total of 30 dead and 300 wounded.13 Vaslui also suffered heavy losses, both human &lt;U+2013&gt; 7 people dead, and material.14
In Ploie&lt;U+0219&gt;ti were destroyed around 200 homes, a further 2,000 were seriously damaged; the situation was also serious in Buz&lt;U+0103&gt;u County, where about 1,900 buildings were affected.15 In Plopeni, a Worker's Dormitory made of masonry totally collapsed, killing 30 to 60 workers and injuring many.16 Counties in Transylvania and Dobrogea showed no serious damage.
The earthquake induced geomorphological phenomena in southern, eastern and northern Wallachia, as well as southern Moldavia. These consisted in landslides, liquefaction, settlements, water spurting; in Vrancea Mountains, the course of Z&lt;U+0103&gt;bala River was partially blocked, forming a small natural dam lake.17
Bulgaria
The earthquake of 4 March was heavily impacted in Bulgaria. The city of Svishtov was the most affected. Here, three blocks of flats collapsed, killing up to 120 people, among them 27 children.18 Many other buildings were damaged, including the Church of the Holy Trinity.19
Aftershocks
The earthquake epicenter was located in the south-west part of Vrancea County, the most active seismic area in Romania, at a depth of about . The shock wave was felt in almost all countries in the Balkan Peninsula, as well as Soviet republics of Ukraine and Moldavia, albeit with a lower intensity. Seismic movement was followed by aftershocks of low magnitude. The strongest aftershock occurred on the morning of 5 March 1977, at 02:00 AM, at a depth of , with a magnitude was 4.9 on the Richter scale. Other aftershocks' magnitudes did not exceed 4.3 or 4.5 Mw.20
Reactions of authorities
At the time of the earthquake, Nicolae and Elena Ceau&lt;U+0219&gt;escu were in an official visit to Nigeria. Ceau&lt;U+0219&gt;escu heard about the disaster in the country from a Romanian official.
Initially, news about the earthquake were confusing, and people talked about a much larger catastrophe. Due to a power failure in Bucharest, communication services weren't run for several hours. The population took to the streets, scared of possible aftershocks. At that moment, authorities had not taken any concrete steps.21
There were rescue teams from all blocks destroyed. Doctors, soldiers, men of different professions were presented at work. Nine hospitals were decommissioned. Floreasca Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, although seriously damaged, was taken by storm. Subsequently, it was evacuated. The Dinamo Stadium was turned into a triage point for the wounded. By the morning of March 5 work was underway on rehabilitating basic utilities &lt;U+2013&gt; water, gas, telephony, electricity.22
After reconnecting with the country, Nicolae Ceau&lt;U+0219&gt;escu imposed the state of emergency throughout the country. The presidential couple and Romanian delegation in Nigeria returned to Romania during the night of 4 to 5 March 1977. In the following days, the Head of State conducted visits to Bucharest to assess damage.23
Teams of military and firefighters responsible for the rescue of possible survivors received aid from the Red Cross. They were joined by the Buftea film studio stuntsmen and many volunteers. Many people were rescued from the ruins, some after several days of being trapped.
