Seal of the Turkish Air Force
Turkish Air Force (Turkish: T&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk Hava Kuvvetleri) is a branch of the Turkish Armed Forces. Turkish Air Force is one of the oldest air forces in the world and operates one of the largest combat aircraft fleets of NATO. Supported by the TuAF's in-flight refueling capability, the fighter jets of the Turkish Air Force can participate in international operations and exercises on every major continent and return back to their home bases.

History
Founding years
The TuAF was founded in June 1909, making it one of the oldest combat aviation organizations in the world. Its formation came about after the Ottoman Empire sent two Turkish pilots to the International Aviation Conference in Paris. After witnessing the growing importance of an air combat support branch, the Turkish government decided to organize its own military aviation program. For this purpose, officers were sent to Europe by the end of 1910 to participate in the study of combat flight. However, because of bad living conditions, the student program was aborted and the trainees returned to Turkey in the spring of 1911.
Although left without any governmental guidelines for establishing an air force, the Turkish Minister of Defence of the time, Mahmut &lt;U+015E&gt;evket, continued to encourage the idea of a military aviation program and sent officers Fesa and Yusuf Kenan, who achieved the highest maneuvering points in a piloting test conducted in 1911, to France to receive a more satisfactory flight education.
In late 1911 S&lt;U+00FC&gt;reyya Ilmen was instructed with founding the Havac&lt;U+0131&gt;l&lt;U+0131&gt;k Komisyonu (Aviation Commission) bound to the Harbiye Bakanl&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt; Fen K&lt;U+0131&gt;talar&lt;U+0131&gt; M&lt;U+00FC&gt;stahkem Genel M&lt;U+00FC&gt;fetti&lt;U+015F&gt;li&lt;U+011F&gt;i (War Ministry Science Detachment General Inspectorship).
1911-1918
 In 1912, Fesa and Yusuf Kenan completed their flight education and returned home with the 780th/797th French aviation diploma. In the same year, eight more Turkish officers were sent to France for flight education. By the beginning of 1913, the Ottoman Empire prepared its first pilots and planes, and with the founding of the Hava Okulu (Air Academy) in Istanbul, the Empire began to tutor its own flight officers. The founding of the Academy quickened advancement in the military aviation program, increased the number of enlisted persons within it, and gave the new pilots an active role in the Armed Forces.
Because of the lack of experience of the Turkish pilots, the first stage of the Balkan War (1912-1913) ended with the loss of several aircraft. However, the second stage was marked with great success in that the pilots were battle-hardened. Many recruits joined the Air Academy following a surge of Turkish nationalism during the war.
Turkish pilots during the World War I years (1914-1918)
With the end of the Balkan War a modernization process started and new planes were bought. A new military academy, Deniz Hava Okulu (Naval Aviation Academy) was founded, also in Istanbul. With the outbreak of the First World War, the modernization process stopped aprubtly, but in 1915 some German officers came to the Ottoman Empire and some Turkish officers went to Germany for flight education.
The Ottoman Air Force fought on many fronts during the First World War, from Galicia in the west to the Caucasus in the east and Yemen in the south.
Efforts were made to reorganize the Ottoman Air Force, but this ended in 1918 with the end of the First World War and the occupation of Istanbul.
1918-1923
With the end of the First World War and the occupation of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman Air Force was nothing more than a department. All personnel, including pilots and teachers, were either relieved of duty or disbanded, and all Air Force governmental buildings were closed. Some optimistic Turks tried to build new units in Istanbul, Izmir, Konya, Elazig and Diyarbakir with planes left over from the First World War and tried to bring together flight personnel, but were unsuccessful.  During this period, the Turks in Anatolia were roused and ready to fight for their independence and motherland under Mustafa Kemal Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk. Turkish pilots were ready to do this, too, and subsequently joined the Konya Hava Istasyonu (Konya Air Station). Parallel to this, however, the Ottoman Air Force was closed by the Ottoman Ministry of War and all personnel were formally discharged. The Ottoman pilots were thus left without planes and proper assistance and the period of Ottoman Aviation ended. But with the opening of the Grand National Assembly in 1920 in Ankara, the reorganization of an ordered Army, the Kuva-y&lt;U+0131&gt; Havaiye (Air Force) bound to the Harbiye Dairesi (Ministry of War bound to the TBMM) was found. A few damaged aircraft belonging to the Grand National Assembly were repaired, and afterwards used in combat.
In 1921, the Hava Kuvvetleri (Kuva-y&lt;U+0131&gt; Havaiye) &lt;U+015E&gt;ubesi air force section was renamed as Hava Kuvvetleri Genel M&lt;U+00FC&gt;d&lt;U+00FC&gt;rl&lt;U+00FC&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+00FC&gt;, or the Air Force General Command.
1923-1940
Turkish Air Force pilots in 1933
After the proclamation of independence and sovereignty and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey by Mustafa Kemal Atat&lt;U+00FC&gt;rk, approaches were made to form a modern Air Force. Originally consisting of 3 normal and 1 naval aviation units, and an Air Force Academy, the number of units was increased to 10 normal and 3 naval aviation units. Starting in 1924, personnel were sent abroad for flight education. In 1925 the Air Force Academy was reestablished in Eski&lt;U+015F&gt;ehir and its first students graduated in that same year. The Air Force was reorganized in 1928 and new schools were found for non-pilot personnel. Additional to the personnel sent to England and France, other personnel were sent to the USA and Italy in 1930.
In 1933 the Air Force became independent and trained its own personnel. The blue uniforms worn by the Air Force were established in 1933 and the Hava Harp Akademisi (&quot;Air War Academy&quot;) was founded in 1937. Turkish Air Force had more than 500 planes in the year of 1940, becoming the strongest Air Force on the Balkans and the Middle East.
1940 - Present

Another structural change was made in 1940. The Air Force under the Milli Savunma Bakanl&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt; (Ministry of National Defense) for logistical affairs and the Air Force under the General Staff of educational affairs were united to form the Hava Kuvvetleri Komutanl&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt; (Air Force Command)-- in doing so, the Air Force became a branch of the Turkish Armed Forces. The first commander-in-chief was General Zeki Do&lt;U+011F&gt;an.
The Hava Teknik Okullar Komutanl&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt; (Air Force Technical School Command) was founded in 1950 to unite schools responsible for training non-pilot Air Force personnel. In 1950 it also was decided to upgrade the Air Force fleet through the inclusion of jets. Eight pilots were sent to the USA to receive flight education. They graduated in 1951 and started training jet-pilots in the Turkish Air Force. In the same year, the 9th Fighter Wing (9uncu Ana Jet &lt;U+00DC&gt;ss&lt;U+00FC&gt;) was founded in Bal&lt;U+0131&gt;kesir as Turkey's first fighter wing; the 191st, 192nd, and 193rd squadrons being the first ones which were established. Further training in the United States followed, usually involving jet manufacturers. Upon Turkey's inclusion in NATO, the process of modernization was accelerated.  In 1962 the Taktik Hava Kuvveti (Tactical Air Force) was founded by upgrading the Hava T&lt;U+00FC&gt;mens (an air unit) to a corps-level organization. In 1956 the Hava E&lt;U+011F&gt;itim Kolordu Komutanl&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt; (Air Education Corps Command) was founded and all education was united under this command. The command was renamed as Hava E&lt;U+011F&gt;itim Komutanl&lt;U+0131&gt;&lt;U+011F&gt;&lt;U+0131&gt; (Air Education Command) in 1957. In 1974 the Air Force was employed in the Cyprus dispute.
With the arrival of 3rd generation fighter jets in 1980, the Air Force was slightly reorganized. Turkish Air Force was part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, employing two squadrons (one in the Ghedi fighter wing, and after 2000 one in the Aviano fighter wing). They returned to Turkey in 2001.
On July 11, 2002 Turkey became a Level 3 partner of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) development program.
In 2006, 4 Turkish F-16 fighter jets were deployed for NATO's Baltic Air Policing operation.
