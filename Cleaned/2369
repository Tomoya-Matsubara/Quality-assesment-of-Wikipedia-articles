The Glarner Sprinter was a named passenger train of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). It ran from Zurich into the canton of Glarus, and was operated as a RegioExpress service. The train provided a commuter service for passengers travelling from the towns and villages of Glarus to the greater Zurich region, whilst also providing a tourist connection (for winter sports, hiking, mountain climbing, etc.) in the opposite direction. In July 2014 it was replaced by a more frequent service as part of the Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich S-Bahn, the S25.1234
History
Since 1918, there was no longer a direct connection from the Canton of Glarus to Zurich. The &quot;Glarner Dream&quot; of a direct connection to Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich was realized by the Pendlerverein (commuter association) of the Glarus government and the SBB as a component of the Swiss Bahn 2000 modernization plan and put into service on 12 April 2004. The plan was for an hourly service, but this could not be achieved due to financial problems in the canton Glarus and technical problems on the part of the SBB.
The Glarner Sprinter ceased operation in July 2014. It was replaced by a more frequent hourly service as part of the Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich S-Bahn, designated as the S25.5
Route and schedule
After leaving Zurich, the Glarner Sprinter ran along the west side of Lake Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich, stopping only at Pf&lt;U+00E4&gt;ffikon and Ziegelbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;cke. From Ziegelbr&lt;U+00FC&gt;cke it followed the valley of the Linth River, stopping at all intermediate stations including those for Glarus Town and Schwanden. On weekends and public holidays, the train then ran without stopping to Linthal; on other days it terminated at Schwanden.67

On working days, the train ran every two hours. On weekends and on public holidays, the train made two return trips each day. The trip from Z&lt;U+00FC&gt;rich to Schwanden took from 1 hour and 5 minutes to 1 hour and 7 minutes; to Linthal, from 1 hour and 19 minutes to 1 hour and 33 minutes.1011
Motive power
The usual motive power on this route was two modernized RBDe 560 &lt;U+00AB&gt;NPZ Domino&lt;U+00BB&gt; dedicated to this route with special Glarner Sprinter livery (RBDe 560 DO GLS 201 and 202). Four Inova coaches (two second class, two first and second class) as well as a first class At control car made up the rest of the consist.12
Prior to the current units, a pair of unmoderminised units (RBDe 560 120 &quot;Netstal&quot; and 560 123 &quot;Braunwald&quot;) were used, again in a special livery. Occasionally, Glarner Sprinter services are carried out with RABe 514 electrical multiple units or Re 450 powered push-pull trains. In the past, a consist made up of two RBe 540 on either end of a set of Einheitswagen I/II cars were sometimes used as replacement.
