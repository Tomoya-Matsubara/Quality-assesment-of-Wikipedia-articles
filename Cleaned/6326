Nick married Mary Vivalda in 1949.  Mary, who had come to California from Kentucky, gave birth to Alfred ten years later.
Alfred's first accordion lesson, which sparked his career in music, was on October 22, 1966, a day before his seventh birthday.  A door-to-door salesman traveling through Lynwood offered the Yankovic parents a choice of accordion or guitar lessons at a local music school. Yankovic claims the reason his parents chose accordion over guitar was They figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world, referring to Frankie Yankovic, to whom he has no relation.cite web url=http://php.indiana.edu/~jbmorris/FAQ/al.booklet  title=Permanent Record: Al In The Box accessdate=2006-08-24  He continued lessons at the school for three years before continuing to learn on his own.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/faq.htm  title=Weird Al Yankovic: Frequently Asked Questions accessdate=2006-10-28 Yankovic's early accordion role models include Frankie Yankovic and Myron Floren the accordionist on The Lawrence Welk Show.  In the 1970s, Yankovic was a big fan of Elton John and claims John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album was partly how I learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion.  He would repeatedly play the album and try to play along on his accordion.  As for his influences in comedic and parody music, Yankovic lists artists including Tom Lehrer, Stan Freberg, Spike Jones, Allan Sherman, Shel Silverstein and Frank Zappa and all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists that he was exposed to through the Dr. Demento Radio Show.cite web url=http://www.myspace.com/weirdal  title=Weird Al Yankovic on MySpace accessdate=2007-04-02  Other sources of inspiration for his comedy come from Mad magazine Mad magazine, Monty Python,cite web url=http://podcasts.triplem.com.au/audio/20070307_spoon_best_weirdalredux.mp3  title=Weird Al Yankovic interview by Spoonman on Triple M Australia accessdate=2007-04-02 and the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker parody movies.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0494  title=Midnight Star Ask Al Q&As for April, 1994 accessdate=2007-04-02
Yankovic began kindergarten a year earlier than most children, and he skipped the second grade. My classmates seemed to think I was some kind of rocket scientist so I was labeled a nerd early on, he recalls.  As his unusual schooling left him two years younger than most of his classmates, Yankovic was not interested in sports or social events at school. He claims to have been a straight-A student throughout high school, which earned him the honor of becoming valedictorian of his senior class. Yankovic was fairly active in his school's extracurricular programs, including the National Forensic League in which he usually brought home some kind of trophy, a play based upon Rebel Without a Cause, the yearbook program for which he wrote most of the captions, and the Volcano Worshipper's Club, which did absolutely nothing. We started the club just to get an extra picture of ourselves in the yearbook.
Dr. Demento, My Bologna, and early fame
In 1976, Yankovic, then a high school senior, sent a homemade Compact Cassette tape to Dr. Demento, the host of a comedy radio program.  The tape's first song was Belvedere Cruisin, about his family's Plymouth Belvedere; another song included on the tape which never received airtime was Dr. D Superstar, a parody of the title song from the musical Jesus Christ Superstar.cite web url=http://weirdal.com/rare89.htm  title=Weird Al Yankovic: Rare Items: UNLABELED TAPE  accessdate=2006-08-24 Demento said 'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines ... I put the tape on the air immediately. Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses saying,
cquote It was sort of like amateur music night, and a lot of people were like wannabe Dan Fogelbergs. They'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads. And I would get up with my accordion and play the theme from '2001.' And people were kind of shocked that I would be disrupting their mellow Thursday night folk fest.http://www.nj.com/entertainment/ledger/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/1186722311157340.xml&coll=1 The clown prince of song parodies., The Star-Ledger, August 10, 2007. p14.  A native of Lynwood a Los Angeles suburb, Yankovic entered show business modestly, with unsolicited submissions to Dr. Demento's syndicated radio show and coffeehouse appearances. It was sort of like amateur music night, and a lot of people were like wannabe Dan Fogelbergs, he says. They'd get up on stage with their acoustic guitar and do these lovely ballads. And I would get up with my accordion and play the theme from '2001.' And people were kind of shocked that I would be disrupting their mellow Thursday night folk fest.
During Yankovic's sophomore year as an architecture student at California Polytechnic State University Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, he became a disc jockey at the university's radio station, KCPR. Yankovic said he had been nicknamed Weird Al by fellow students and took it on professionally as his persona for the station. In 1978, he released his first recording as Alfred Yankovic, Take Me Down, on the LP, Slo Grown, as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of San Luis Obispo County, California San Luis Obispo County.  The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as the fountain toilets at Madonna Inn.
In mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, My Sharona by The Knack was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the echo chamber acoustics and recorded a parody entitled My Bologna. He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners.  Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college, and introduced himself as the author of My Bologna. The Knack's lead singer, Doug Fieger, said he liked the song and suggested that Capitol Records vice president Rupert Perry release the song as a single. My Bologna was released as a single with School Cafeteria as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract.cite video people=McNamara, Michael Director  title=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0520918/ Behind the Music: Weird Al Yankovic medium=TV series publisher=VH1 date=1999  Yankovic, who was only getting average grades in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.
On September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the Dr. Demento Show, where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called Another One Rides the Bus, a parody of Queen band Queen's hit, Another One Bites the Dust. While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met Jon Schwartz drummer Jon Bermuda Schwartz, who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began. Another One Rides the Bus became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on the Tomorrow TV series The Tomorrow Show April 21, 1981 with Tom Snyder. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects.
The band and fame 
1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a Phoenix, Arizona Phoenix, Arizona, nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was blown away. Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full Musical ensemble band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. Steve Jay became Yankovic's bass guitar bass player, and Jay's friend Jim West guitarist Jim West played guitar. Schwartz continued on drum kit drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982.  Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for Missing Persons band Missing Persons. The unimpressed audience Bottling concert abuse threw items at the group, and they were booed off the stage.
Yankovic recorded I Love Rocky Road a parody of I Love Rock 'n' Roll as recorded by Joan Jett Joan Jett and The Blackhearts in 1982.  Due to the influence of his new producer, Rick Derringer, it managed to become a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with Scotti Brothers Records. In 1983, Yankovic's first Weird Al Yankovic album self-titled album was released on Scotti Bros. He released his second album Weird Al Yankovic in 3-D in 1984. The first single Eat It, a parody of the Michael Jackson song Beat It, became quite popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's Beat It music video, and to Yankovic's self-styled uncanny resemblance to Jackson. Peaking at number 12 on the Billboard magazine Billboard Billboard Hot 100 Hot 100, Eat It remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until White & Nerdy placed at number 9 in October 2006.
In 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a mockumentary of his own life entitled The Compleat Al, which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the Al TV specials. The Compleat Al was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct UHF film UHF four years later. Also released around the same time as The Compleat Al was The Authorized Al, a biographical book based on the film.  The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents.
Yankovic and his band toured as the opening act for The Monkees in mid-1987 for their second reunion tour of North America. Yankovic claims to have enjoyed touring with The Monkees, despite the fact the promoter gypped us out of a bunch of money.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1198  title=Ask Al Q&As for November, 1998 accessdate=2007-06-05
Yankovic also appeared on the Wendy Carlos recording of Sergei Prokofiev Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf Peter and the Wolf as the narrator in 1988. The album also included a sequel of Camille Saint-Sans's composition The Carnival of the Animals entitled the Carnival of the Animals Part II, with Yankovic providing humorous poems for each of the featured creatures in the style of Ogden Nash, who had written humorous poems for the original. Rubn Valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts.
A factual biographical booklet of Yankovic's life, written by Dr. Demento, was released with the 1994 box set compilation Permanent Record: Al in the Box.  The Dr. Demento Society, which issues yearly Christmas re-releases of material from Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes, often includes unreleased tracks from Yankovic's vaults, such as Pacman, It's Still Billy Joel To Me or the live version of School Cafeteria.
New look, personal life, and career to present

On January 24, 1998, Yankovic had LASIK eye surgery to correct his extreme myopiacite web url=http://weirdal.com/thelook1.htm title=LASIK story and pictures.  In the same period, he shaved off his moustache and grew out his hair, thus radically changing his trademark look. He had previously shaved his mustache in 1983 for the video of Ricky song Ricky in order to resemble Desi Arnaz more closely, and in 1996 for his Amish Paradise video. Yankovic reasoned, If Madonna entertainer Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15&nbsp;minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every twenty years.cite web url=http://web.archive.org/web/20010208173222/http://www.weirdal.com/bio.htm  title=Archive.org for www.weirdal.com/bio.htm for February 8, 2001 accessdate=2006-10-29 He parodied the reaction to this new look in a commercial for his nonexistent MTV Unplugged special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for The Saga Begins, claiming his new look was an attempt to get back to the core of what I'm all about, that being the music.cite web url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/videos/EatItUnpluggedPromo.wmv  title=Weird Al Yankovic MTV Unplugged Promo accessdate=2006-10-28
Yankovic married Suzanne Krajewski on February 10, 2001. Their daughter, Nina, was born February 11, 2003. They also have a pet cockatiel named Bo Veaner. They used to have a pet poodle, Bela pictured atop Yankovic's head on the cover of his album, Poodle Hat.  Despite songs such as Pretty Fly for a Rabbi, his frequent use of Oy vey and other Yiddish language Yiddish phrases, Yankovic is not of Jewish ancestry, and identifies himself as a Christianity Christian.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0795  title=Midnight Star Ask Al Q&As for July, 1995 accessdate=2007-04-04

On April 9, 2004, Yankovic's parents, Nick, 86, and Mary, 81, were found dead in their Fallbrook, California, home, apparently the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from their fireplace that had been recently lit. The flue was closed, which trapped the carbon monoxide gas inside the house, suffocating them. An hour after his wife notified him of his parents' death, Yankovic went on with his concert in Appleton, Wisconsin,cite web url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20040410-9999-1mc10ffire.html  title=Fallbrook couple found dead   accessdate=2007-02-16 saying that since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well and that it would at least ... give me a break from sobbing all the time.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/msg.htm  title=A Message From Al accessdate=2006-08-24

Yankovic's work
Music
main List of songs by Weird Al Yankovic
While Yankovic's song parodies such as Eat It have resulted in success on the Billboard charts see List of singles by Weird Al Yankovic, he has actually recorded an equally large number of original humorous songs You Don't Love Me Anymore and One More Minute. His work depends largely on the satirizing of popular culture, including television see The TV Album, movies The Saga Begins, food see The Food Album, popular music the polkas, and sometimes issues in contemporary news Headline News song Headline News.  Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing serious music.  In his reasoning, There's enough people that do unfunny music.  I'll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline.cite web url=http://hub.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070702/NOISE02/707040313/1104/HUB  title='Weird Al' Yankovic - Parodist promises a high-energy show -- with costume changes accessdate=2007-07-08
Although many of Yankovic's songs are parodies of contemporary radio hits, it is rare that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Exceptions include Smells Like Nirvana, which references unintelligible lyrics in Smells Like Teen Spirit, Achy Breaky Song, which refers to the song Achy Breaky Heart, This Song's Just Six Words Long, which refers to the repetitious lyrics in Got My Mind Set on You, the unreleased It's Still Billy Joel to Me, and Confessions_Part_III#Track_listing Confessions Part III, which references Confessions Usher album Confessions and Confessions Usher album Confessions Part II in the first few lines.
Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content such as the rapping rap songs Amish Paradise and White & Nerdy, or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clichs such as eBay song eBay and Don't Download This Song.
Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs, and for legal and personal reasons does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans.  There exists, however, one exception to this rule in the case of Like a Surgeon.  Madonna entertainer Madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her Like a Virgin song Like a Virgin into Like a Surgeon.  Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey.
Unlike other parody artists such as Tom Lehrer and Allan Sherman, Yankovic strives to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original. While Lehrer reproduced the songs on piano and Sherman reproduced them orchestrally, Yankovic and his band essentially play the original song with new lyrics. Instead of using instrumental versions of the original songs, Yankovic and his band transcribe the original song by ear and re-record the song for Yankovic's parody version.cite web url=http://www.weirdalforum.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=4730&view=findpost&p=306317  title=World of Weird Al Yankovic Forums - Ask Jim accessdate=2006-10-30
In addition to his parodies, Yankovic also includes a medley of various songs on most albums, each one reinterpreted as a polka, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. Yankovic has been known to say that converting these songs to polka was the way God intended.  Because the polkas have become a staple of Yankovic's albums, he has said he tries to include one on each album because fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley.cite web url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/Weird_Al_talks_new_album_2007_tour-10776.html?t=1  title='Weird Al' talks new album, 2007 tour accessdate=2006-10-26
Some of Yankovic's original songs are pastiches or style parodies, for which he chooses a band's entire body of work to honor/parody, rather than any single hit by that band. Such bands include Devo with Dare to Be Stupid song Dare to Be Stupid, Talking Heads with Dog Eat Dog, Frank Zappa with Genius in France, Nine Inch Nails with Germs, or most recently, charity records with Don't Download This Song.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100  title=Ask Al Q&As for January, 2000 accessdate=2006-10-30 Others are style parodies in the style of a music genre genre of music, rather than a specific band for example, country music with Good Enough For Now.
Yankovic has contributed original songs to several films This Is the Life song This Is the Life from Johnny Dangerously; Polkamon from the movie Pokmon: The Movie 2000, and a parody of the James Bond title sequence in Spy Hard, in addition to his own film, UHF film UHF. Other songs of his have appeared in films or television series as well, such as Dare to Be Stupid song Dare to Be Stupid in The Transformers: The Movie.
Yankovic's recurring jokes include the number 27 number 27 as seen on the covers for Running with Scissors album Running With Scissors, Poodle Hat, and Straight Outta Lynwood and the names Bob the Al TV interviews often mention the name,cite web url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVGiUu2ciYY  title=Weird Al Interviews Avril Lavigne accessdate=2006-10-29 Frank e.g. Frank's 2000 TV, and the surname Finkelstein e.g. the music video for I Lost on Jeopardy.  Also, a hamster called Harvey the Wonder Hamster is a recurring character in The Weird Al Show and the Al TV specials, as well as the subject of an original song on Alapalooza.  Yankovic has also put two backmasking messages into his songs.  The first, in Nature Trail to Hell, said Satan Eats Cheez Whiz; the second, in I Remember Larry, said Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands.cite web url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/#secret  title=Al-oholics Anonymous' Frequently Asked Questions accessdate=2006-08-24
His latest three album releases feature the longest songs Yankovic has ever released. The Albuquerque song Albuquerque track from Running with Scissors is 11&nbsp;minutes and 23&nbsp;seconds; Genius in France from Poodle Hat runs for 8&nbsp;minutes and 56&nbsp;seconds; Trapped in the Drive-Thru from Straight Outta Lynwood is 10&nbsp;minutes and 53&nbsp;seconds long. Before 2007, apart from a one-off performance of Albuquerque in Albuquerque, New Mexico,cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/setlists.htm  title=Weird Al Yankovic: Concert Set Lists accessdate=2006-10-28 these epic songs were not performed live in their entirety due to their length and complexity.  See #Live performances Live performances for details
=Music videos=
While Yankovic's music generally does not parody the song or the artist of the original song, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes incorporate parodies of many elements of the original song's music video, or otherwise spoof the general style of the music.  Most notably, the video for Smells Like Nirvana uses an extremely similar set to Nirvana band Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, including using several of the same actors.  This video contended with Smells like Teen Spirit at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video.  Other videos that are parodies of their original song videos include Eat It, Fat song Fat, Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies, Bedrock Anthem, Headline News, and White & Nerdy.  The video for Dare to Be Stupid is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of Devo videos.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0100  title=Ask Al Q&As for January, 2000  accessdate=2007-08-05  It's All about the Pentiums is a parody of It's All about the Benjamins by Sean Combs Puff Daddy. Recent videos have included notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band; for example, Dick Van Patten is featured in both Smells Like Nirvana and Bedrock Anthem, Drew Carey, Emo Philips, and Phil LaMarr appear in It's All About the Pentiums, and Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Donny Osmond and Seth Green appear in White & Nerdy.
=Reactions from original artists=
Under the fair use provision of U.S. copyright law, affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States United States Supreme Court, one does not need permission to record a parody.Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., Findlaw_us 510 569 1994 However, as a personal rule, and as a means of maintaining good relationships within the music community, Yankovic has always requested permission from the original artist before recording his parodies. Most artists have had positive reactions to Yankovic's parodies.  Several have considered it to be something of a badge of honor to have Yankovic ask permission to parody their song or style, since they felt that Yankovic would not choose to do so unless they were a success or had made an impact on the music scene at the time. However, there are a few notable exceptions where people have not allowed parodies or have otherwise withdrawn permission.
Positive
Dave Grohl of Nirvana band Nirvana said that the band felt they had made it after Yankovic recorded Smells Like Nirvana, a parody of the Grunge music grunge band's smash hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit. On his Behind the Music special, Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, Um ...  it's not gonna be about food, is it? Yankovic responded with No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics. According to members of Nirvana interviewed for Behind the Music, when they saw the video of the song, they laughed hysterically. Additionally, Cobain described Yankovic as a musical genius.cite web url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/gig-previews--reviews/weird-al-yankovic/2007/03/19/1174152930142.html  title=Weird Al Yankovic - Gig previews & reviews - Music - Entertainment accessdate= 2007-04-16

However, Yankovic has performed a concert-only parody Snack All Night in some of his live shows. Yankovic also has a cameo appearance, along with many other celebrities, in Jackson's music video for Liberian Girl.
Mark Knopfler approved Yankovic's parody of the Dire Straits song Money for Nothing song Money for Nothing for use in the film UHF film UHF on the provision that Knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies,cite web url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/bio  title=Biography for 'Weird Al' Yankovic accessdate=2007-09-15.  Yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the DVD audio commentary for UHF, explaining We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing 'slash' Beverly Hillbillies 'asterisk' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name. Those wacky lawyers! What ya gonna do?Al Yankovic, UHF DVD Audio Commentary 0:35:15  The Permanent Record: Al in the Box booklet referred to the song's compound fracture of a title.  When a fan asked about the song's title, Yankovic shared his feelings on the title, replying That incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as. I'm not sure why, and I've obviously never been very happy about it.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1098 title=Ask Al Q&As for October, 1998 accessdate=2007-09-15
The Presidents of the United States of America band The Presidents of the United States of America were so pleased with Gump, Yankovic's parody of their song Lump, that they ended the song with Yankovic's last line instead of their own And that's all I have to say about that on the live recording of Lump featured on the compilation album Pure Frosting.cite web url=http://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/presidents_of_the_united_states_of_america/lump_live-lyrics-945109.html  title=Allthelyrics.com - Lyrics to Lump live by The Presidents of the United States of America accessdate=2008-03-15 In 2008, Yankovic directed the music video for their song Mixed Up S.O.B.cite web url= http://blogs.thenewstribune.com/ej/2008/02/04/weird_al_yankovic_to_direct_next_preside title=Bring the Noise Weird Al Yankovic to direct next Presidents of the United States of America video  publisher=The News Tribune author=Ernest Jasmin accessdate=2008-05-31
The song The Saga Begins a parody of Don McLean's American Pie accurately states the entire plot of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace The Phantom Menace, despite being written before the film's release. Yankovic got the plot details from rumor websites. He was slightly unsure about Darth Vader Anakin proposing to Padm Amidala Amidala, so he attended a United States dollar US$500 screening to confirm, and ended up making only very minor alterations to the lyrics. McLean was pleased with the parody, and even told Yankovic that the parody's lyrics sometimes enter his mind during live performances.cite web url=http://weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0999 title=Ask Al Q&As for September, 1999  accessdate=2006-10-29  Yankovic's parody not only replicates the music from the original Don McLean song, but it also replicates the multi-layered rhyming structure in the verses and chorus. Additionally, George Lucas loved the song and a Lucasfilm representative told Yankovic, You should have seen the smile on his face.cite web url= http://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/weirdal.asp  title=TheForce.Net - Jedi Council -  Interviews - Weird Al Yankovic  publisher=TheForce.Net author=Chris Knight accessdate=2006-08-24
Chamillionaire was also very pleased, even putting Yankovic's parody White & Nerdy on his official MySpace page before it was on Yankovic's own page. Chamillionaire stated in an interview, He's actually rapping pretty good on it, it's crazy ... I didn't know he could rap like that.  It's really an honor when he does that. ...

Negative
One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's Amish Paradise, based on Gangsta's Paradise song Gangsta's Paradise by hip-hop artist Coolio, which, in turn, was based on Songs in the Key of Life Pastime Paradise by Stevie Wonder. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted  Royalties royalty payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. At the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, I dont remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt Ill be invited to Coolios next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#042706  title=Ask Al Q&As for April 27, 2006 accessdate=2006-09-02
In 2003, Yankovic was denied permission to make a video for Couch Potato song Couch Potato, his parody of Eminem's Lose Yourself:
cquote Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career.cite web url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20041014/ai_n12565818  title=Is the King of Pop losing it?  author=Mike Thomas  publisher=Chicago Sun-Times  accessdate = 2006-10-29
For the Poodle Hat Al TV special, Yankovic raised the question of artistic expression in a false interview with Eminem. As Yankovic has always done for his Al TV specials, he edited the footage of a previous Eminem interview and inserted himself asking questions for comic effect.cite web url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPwBdnknGIs  title=Eminem Interview  accessdate=2008-01-15
Refused parodies
On numerous occasions, Prince musician Prince has refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs. Yankovic has stated in interviews that he has approached him every few years to see if he's lightened up.cite web url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/hotwired.txt  title=Weird Al Yankovic Interview by Michael Small of Hotwired.com accessdate=2006-10-28

Paul McCartney, also a Yankovic fan, refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of Wings band Wings' Live and Let Die song Live and Let Die, entitled Chicken Pot Pie, because McCartney is a vegetarian and did not wish to condone the eating of meat.cite web url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/alicon.html  title=Weird Al Yankovic: The Icon Profile accessdate=2006-10-28  Yankovic, who is a vegetarian as well, has stated that he respects McCartney's decision to refuse the parody, and is hesitant to put Paul on the list of artists who have refused permission for a parody. However, like Snack All Night, Chicken Pot Pie has been performed numerous times in concert. His concerts often feature parodies for which the artist did not give permission or could not be released for various reasons.

In 2006, Yankovic gained James Blunt's permission to record a parody of You're Beautiful. However, after Yankovic had recorded You're Pitiful, Blunt's label, Atlantic Records, rescinded this permission. The parody was pulled from Yankovic's Straight Outta Lynwood due to his label's unwillingness to go to war with Atlantic. Yankovic released the song as a free download on his MySpace profile, as well as his official website, and plays it in concert, since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody.cite web url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482774  title=Free 'Weird Al' Yankovic! accessdate=2006-08-24

Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes. A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour for the Running with Scissors album Running with Scissors album Touring With Scissors was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000.  Titled Weird Al Yankovic Live!, the concert was recorded at the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California, on October 2, 1999.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/100299.htm  title=Weird Al Photo Gallery - Backstage Pep Talk accessdate=2006-11-10  For legal reasons, video clips apart from those for Yankovic's own music videos could not be shown for the home release, and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0300  title=Ask Al Q&As for March, 2000 accessdate=2006-11-10

UHF
main UHF film
In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey, and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma called UHF film UHF. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion Pictures Orion their highest test screening test scores since the movie RoboCop.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0599  title=Ask Al Q&As for May, 1999 accessdate=2006-10-28 However, it was unsuccessful in theaters, likely due to a release in mid-1989, going up against Ghostbusters II, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Batman 1989 film Batman, and others.
The film has since become a Cult film cult classic, with out-of-print copies of the VHS version selling for up to $100 on eBay until the release of the DVD in 2002. Yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts to which Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer MGM, the film's current owner, initially  objected in the form of a cease and desist letter.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#0500  title=Ask Al Q&As for May, 2000 accessdate=2006-10-26  To apparently make it more accessible to overseas audiences where Ultra high frequency UHF TV stations were less prominent, the film was titled UHF film The Vidiot From UHF in Australia and parts of Europe.cite web url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/  title=UHF 1989 accessdate=2006-10-26
UHF shows the creation of Yankovic's signature foodthe Twinkie Wiener Sandwich. The snack consists of an overturned Twinkie split open as a makeshift bun, a hot dog, and Easy Cheese. Yankovic has stated that he has switched to using tofu hot dogs since becoming a Vegetarianism vegetarian, but still enjoys the occasional Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#1095  title=Midnight Star Ask Al Q&As for October/November, 1995 accessdate=2006-10-26
Notable television appearances
Yankovic had a TV series called The Weird Al Show, which aired from September 1997 to December 1997 on CBS. Though the show appeared to be geared at children, the humor was really more for his adult fans as such, it is often compared to Pee-wee's Playhouse. The entire series was released on DVD by Shout! Factory on August 15, 2006.
Yankovic has hosted Al TV on MTV and Al Music on MuchMusic many times, generally coinciding with the release of each new album. For Poodle Hat, Al TV appeared on VH1 for the first time. A recurring segment of Al TV involves Yankovic manipulating interviews for comic effect. He inserts himself into a previously conducted interview with a musician, and then manipulates his questions, resulting in bizarre and comic responses from the celebrity.
VH1 produced a Behind the Music episode on Yankovic; however, he was so clean-cut that the producers could not find any of the typical angst-laced problems that make many rock stars' stories compelling as Yankovic noted in the episode, so they stretched many smaller disappointments and skirmishes during his career into major downfalls to fit the program's classic formula. His two commercial failures his film UHF film UHF and his 1986 album Polka Party! were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, Coolio's later disapproval of Amish Paradise was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired.
Yankovic has done voice-overs for a number of animated series. He appeared in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons, singing The Ballad of Homer & Marge a parody of John Mellencamp's Jack and Diane with his band. The episode, Three Gays of the Condo, in which Marge Simpson Marge hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to Homer Simpson Homer in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program For Programming Less Than One Hour. Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, entitled That 90's Show, during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit Shave Me entitled Brain Freeze Homer's song, Shave Me, was itself a parody of Nirvana's Rape Me. Yankovic is the voice for List of characters in The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy#Toadblatt.27s Summer School of Sorcery Squid Hat on the Cartoon Network US Cartoon Network show, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy. He is also the announcer of the cartoon's eponymous The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy video game video game adaptation.  Yankovic had a guest appearance voicing Wreck-Gar, a waste collection vehicle Transformer in the Transformers: Animated cartoon series;cite web url=http://www.seibertron.com/transformers/news/cartoon-network-to-air-transformers-animated-episo/13008/  title=Cartoon Network To Air Transformers Animated Episode Garbage In, Garbage Out--10:30AM accessdate=2008-06-15 previously, Yankovic's Dare to Be Stupid song was featured in the 1986 animated film The Transformers: The Movie, during the sequence in which the Wreck-Gar character was first introduced; as such, the song is referenced in the episode.

Misattribution and imitators
Image:WeirdAlLimeWire.png thumb A screenshot of LimeWire PRO, showing a large number of parodies misattributed to Yankovic, as well as numerous misspellings of his surname
Songs posted to file sharing networks are often misattributed to him due to their humorous subject matter.  Often, his surname is misspelled and thus mispronounced as Yankovich, among other variations. Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott due to his supposedly explicit lyrics.cite web url=http://www.weirdal.com/aaarchive.htm#100205  title=Ask Al Q&As for October 2, 2005 accessdate=2006-08-24 Quite a few of the songs, such as Star_Wars_Cantina_%28song%29#Parody_song Star Wars Cantina by Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine Mark Jonathan Davis later of Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine, Star Wars Gangsta Rap, Yoda Smokes Weed, Chewbacca and several more have a Star Wars motif.cite web url=http://free.house.cx/~eil/etc/notal_list.html  title=The Not Al Page: The most popular songs he didn't even write or perform! accessdate=2006-08-24 Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as Sesame Street on crack, which is also widely misattributed to Adam Sandler.
Yankovic cites these misattributions as his only real beef with peer-to-peer file sharing sites:
cquote If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with. That particularly bothers me, because I really try to do quality work, and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly imageand some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just, well, vulgar and awful. I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet.cite web url=http://www.itworld.com/Tech/2987/060918download  title=Don't not download this song accessdate=2006-09-23

Fan-driven campaigns
The Weird Al Star Fund is a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Their mission is to solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate 'Weird Al' Yankovic for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.cite web url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/  title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Campaign for Weird Al Yankovic accessdate = 2007-03-15 Fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the United States dollar US$15,000 needed for a nomination. In addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held April 11, 2006, and selling merchandise on the official website and eBay, including T-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks.cite web url=http://www.weirdalstar.com/tributeshow.html  title=The Hollywood Walk of Fame Star Campaign for Weird Al Yankovic accessdate = 2006-10-29 On May 26, 2006, the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the May 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork. However, Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007.cite web url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=8ce9efb9-2eb5-4f61-85ab-c5c2ffb9d885  title=Damon, Diddy, Ponch Got Star Power author=Gina Serpe publisher=E! Online News accessdate = 2006-10-29 On February 9, 2007, the Hollywood Chamber Of Commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to $25,000 and as such the Fund is accepting donations again.

Similar to the Weird Al Star Fund, a second fan-driven campaign is the effort to Make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Rock Hall Weird.

The Hall has not considered Yankovic for nomination since the campaign started in 2004.
