The UCL Eastman Dental Institute is a dental school located in London, United Kingdom and an academic department of the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University College London (UCL).1 It is based on Gray's Inn Road in the Bloomsbury district of Central London adjacent to the Eastman Dental Hospital, with which it is closely associated.234
The Institute is the largest postgraduate dental centre in Europe, and together with the Eastman Dental Hospital forms one of the largest concentrations of oral health care specialists and research in Europe.56 The Institute runs a CPD programme with the British Dental Journal which is one of the largest of its type, with around 14,000 dental care professionals enrolled.7
History
 In 1926 George Eastman donated &lt;U+00A3&gt;200,000 to fund the establishment of a dental clinic in London, after being approached by the Chairman of the Royal Free Hospital, Lord Riddell, with donations of &lt;U+00A3&gt;50,000 each also made by Lord Riddell and the Royal Free honorary treasurer.8 On 20 November 1931, the Eastman Dental Clinic opened as part of the Royal Free Hospital. In 1948, the Eastman became independent of the Royal Free and became the postgraduate dental institute of the Postgraduate Medical Federation.9 In 1949 the Eastman opened a department of pathology and microbiology and the first civilian oral hygiene school in the UK.1011
During the Directorship of Professor Frank Wilson (1950&lt;U+2013&gt;1959) a full department range was established at the Eastman, including children&lt;U+2019&gt;s, oral surgery, radiography and prosthetics.1213 The Directorship of Sir Robert Bradlaw (1959&lt;U+2013&gt;1970) saw the Eastman&lt;U+2019&gt;s teaching concept altered, with MSc courses of the University of London being introduced.14 In 1988 the Eastman moved to the old Royal Free buildings on Gray's Inn Road and in 1992 the Eastman's name was changed to the Eastman Dental Institute (EDI).15
In October 1995 the Institute established a joint project with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory to develop ultraviolet lasers to replace conventional dental drills.16 The Institute merged with University College London in 1999, becoming the UCL Eastman Dental Institute,17 and in 2002 it won the Queens Award for Higher Education.1819

The Institute achieved top scores of 5 in both the 1996 and 2001 Research Assessment Exercises and the Institute's research programme is one of only two oral themes to achieve national funding within an NHS Biomedical Research Centre, as part of the UCLH/UCL Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre.20 Both the Institute and the Eastman Dental Hospital are part of UCL Partners, the largest academic health science centre in Europe.21
