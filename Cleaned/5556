Matteo Ricci College, one of six schools and colleges at Seattle University in Washington state, offers two degrees: the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities for Teaching (BAHT) and the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities (BAH). The BAHT, a 4-year pre-education degree, is open to students from anywhere in the world. The BAH is a 3-year degree open only to select students from Seattle Preparatory, O'Dea, Kennedy Catholic, Eastside Catholic, Forest Ridge and Archbishop Murphy high schools.
Named after the 16th Century Italian Jesuit missionary, Matteo Ricci, the College was founded in 1975 as an experimental college where a student could complete high school and university studies in 6 years. Funding for an articulated program of study came from the Carnegie Foundation. In 1988, the College opened doors to the 3-year BAH to students from five local Catholic schools, beginning with O&lt;U+2019&gt;Dea and Kennedy catholic and later adding Eastside Catholic, Forest Ridge and Archbishop Murphy, who completed university classes during their senior year of high school. In 2003, Matteo Ricci College launched the Bachelor of Arts in Humanities for Teaching degree.
