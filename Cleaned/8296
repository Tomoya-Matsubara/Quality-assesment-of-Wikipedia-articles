For Portuguese heads of state prior to 1910, see the list of Portuguese monarchs.
 The complete list of Presidents of the Portuguese Republic consists of the 20 heads of state in the history of Portugal since the October 5, 1910 revolution that installed a republican regime. This list includes not only those persons who sworn into office as President of Portugal but also those who de facto served as head of state since 1910. This is the case of Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo Braga who served as President of the Provisional Government after the republican coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat. Also Sid&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio Pais, Mendes Cabe&lt;U+00E7&gt;adas, Gomes da Costa, as well as Canto e Castro and &lt;U+00D3&gt;scar Carmona in their early months, weren't sworn into office as President of the Republic, usually being the President of the Ministry (Prime Minister), but de facto accumulation this functions with that of the Head of State. See the notes for more information.
The numbering reflects the uninterrupted time in office served by a single person. For example, Jorge Sampaio served two consecutive terms and is counted as the 19th president (not the 19th and 20th). Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo Braga served as the first and sole president of the Provisional Government, and therefore is not considered the first President, although he would serve again as head of state and be the 2nd president after Manuel de Arriaga's resignation. Bernardino Machado served two non-consecutive terms and is counted as both the 3rd and the 8th president. Because of this, the list below contains 20 presidencies, but only 19 presidents.
The current President of Portugal is An&lt;U+00ED&gt;bal Cavaco Silva, winner of the 2006 presidential election.
The colors indicate the political affiliation of each President.

Te&lt;U+00F3&gt;filo Braga served as President of the Provisional Government, the de facto head of government and head of state, from the republican revolution of 1910 to the election of Manuel de Arriaga, the 1st President of Portugal.↩
After doing a coup d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat, Sid&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio Pais became President of the Revolutionary Junta and later Prime Minister (President of the Ministry). He abolished the post of President of the Republic, assuming himself as the head of state as Prime Minister. He was assassinated in 1918.↩
Canto e Castro was head of the Council of Ministers that served as the head of state of Portugal after the assassination of Sid&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio Pais in 1918, from December 14 to December 16. He then became interim president until the election of Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Almeida.↩
Mendes Cabe&lt;U+00E7&gt;adas, Gomes da Costa and &lt;U+00D3&gt;scar Carmona were the heads of the revolutionary provisional governments during the year of 1926. Although not called Presidents, they were de facto heads of state.↩
&lt;U+00D3&gt;scar Carmona served initially as head of the revolutionary government after a counter-coup deposed Gomes da Costa. He was de facto head of state between July 9 and November 16, 1926. However he officially took office as President of the Republic on November 16, 1926. Six years later, in 1932, the Estado Novo was proclaimed and the National Union, the only legal party, was formed by Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Oliveira Salazar. Carmona joined the party and was the party's candidate for every presidential election (that were considered fraudulent) until 1951, when he died.↩
Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Oliveira Salazar, the dictatorial President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) occupied the post of president interim between the death of &lt;U+00D3&gt;scar Carmona and the election of Francisco Craveiro Lopes.↩
Between the Carnation Revolution on April 25, 1974 and May 15 of the same year, Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Sp&lt;U+00ED&gt;nola was the head of the National Salvation Junta, being the de facto head of state and government. After May 15 Adelino da Palma Carlos became the Prime Minister, and Sp&lt;U+00ED&gt;nola continued as de jure head of state as President of the Republic.↩
