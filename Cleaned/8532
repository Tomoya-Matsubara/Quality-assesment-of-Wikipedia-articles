GooGoo Cluster and GooGoo Supreme 6-pack boxes
The GooGoo Cluster is an American candy bar sold since 1912 in Nashville, Tennessee. It was developed by Howell Campbell and the Standard Candy Company. The disk-shaped candy bar contains marshmallow, caramel and roasted peanuts covered in milk chocolate. GooGoo Cluster is considered the first combination candy bar, meaning it contained several types of candy rather than an all-chocolate bar. The name is thought to refer to the sound a baby makes; another theory is that the candy was sold at the Grand Ole Opry (GOO).
During the Great Depression, Goo Goo Clusters were advertised as &quot;a nourishing lunch for a nickel.&quot; This slogan was used until the 1950s.
Variations include GooGoo Supreme (pecans replace the peanuts) and Peanut Butter GooGoo (peanut butter replaces marshmallow).
GooGoo Clusters have appeared in the movies Nashville (film), The Nutty Professor and Charlie's War.
GooGoo Clusters have also appeared throughout the PC video game &quot;Redneck Rampage&quot; and &quot;Viva Pinata&quot;.
