Match
Summary
File:Wem.jpg  thumb 200px right The final was held at Wembley Stadium 1923 Wembley, which had previously hosted three finals.
1978 was the first year in which Club Brugge had reached the final, while Liverpool were appearing in their second successive final. The two teams had met before in the final of a European competition: the 1976 UEFA Cup Final, which Liverpool won 43 on aggregate.cite web url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec197576.html#uefa  title=UEFA Cup 197576  publisher=Rec. Sport. Soccer. Statistisc. Foundation  date=9 January 2008  accessdate=24 April 2011  first= James M.  last=Ross Liverpool were the reigning champions and were aiming to become the first British team to win successive European Cups. Liverpool had already won the UEFA Cup twice, in the 197273 UEFA Cup 197273 and 197576 UEFA Cup 197576 seasons.cite web url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/honours  title=Honours  publisher=Liverpool F.C  accessdate=24 April 2011  Brugge were the first Belgian team to reach the final of the European Cup and thus were aiming to become the first to win the trophy.
As the final was held in England at Wembley Stadium 1923 Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup.cite book  last=Hale  year=1992  page=133  Brugge were without a number of key players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose inclusion in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised.cite news url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/663  title=Liverpool's tunes of glory  first=David  last=Lacey  work=The Guardian  location=London  date=10 May 1978  accessdate=20 April 2011  Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith footballer born 1945 Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on his foot and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson footballer born 1951 David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City F.C. Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season.
The first half was dull. Brugge held back, using tight Marking association football marking and the offside trap to restrict Liverpool's attacking threat. Towards the end of the fist half, Liverpool started to have more scoring chances. Alan Kennedy volleyed across the face of the goal, and Jimmy Case took a free kick that needed to be punched away by Brugge goalkeeper Birger Jensen. In the closing minutes of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked David Fairclough, who had made a run towards goal, and he tipped a header by Alan Hansen over the crossbar. So the score at half-time was 00.
Early in the second half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first significant chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by Ren Vandereycken reached Jan Srensen on the right-hand side of the pitch. Srensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos K could reach it and score. After this K was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the right-hand side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received the ball in the Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 10 lead.
Brugge now needed to score, but they only created one more chance. Ten minutes before the end of the match, Srensen intercepted a Hansen backpass and shot. His shot was blocked by Clemence, and a goal-line clearance by Phil Thompson prevented Brugge from equalising. The match remained at 10 and Liverpool won their second consecutive European Cup, becoming the first British team to retain the trophy.cite web url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/history/timeline/1970-1995/wembley-glory-as-reds-beat-bruges  title=Wembley glory as Reds beat Bruges  publisher=Liverpool F.C  accessdate=24 April 2011 
After the match, figures from each team were critical of the other team's play. Liverpool defender Tommy Smith criticised Brugge for their approach, saying It was a pathetic attitude. You never win anything like that. Liverpool manager Bob Paisley also criticised the Belgian team's tactics: It takes two teams to make a game into a spectacle and Bruges only seemed to be concerned with keeping the score down. Bruges didn't come at us much - apart from one mistake in our defence, they never looked like scoring. But they were well organised at the back and it was a case of breaking them down. We controlled the game from start to finish. Meanwhile Club Brugge manager Ernst Happel was critical of the quality of the Liverpool team: Liverpool seemed only a shadow of the side we played in the UEFA Cup final two seasons ago. I was disappointed with them, but they deserved their victory although we were handicapped by injuries to two players.
