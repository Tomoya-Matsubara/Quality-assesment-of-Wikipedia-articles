Random Recipe is a Canadian musical group founded in 2007 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The band is comprised of members Frannie Holder (vocals/guitar), Fabrizia Difruscia (rap/beatbox), Vincent Legault (guitar/keys), and Liu-Kong Ha (percussion/keys).1. Although the band performs and records primarily in English, many of their songs contain French, Spanish and Italian lyrics.2 In 2008, they were hailed by Spin Magazine as one of the top 5 up-and-coming Montreal bands.3
History
Frannie and Fab met in 2005 whilst both were university students, studying political science at McGill University and translation at Concordia University, respectively.4 Their first public performances were free-of-charge and spontaneous, including busking in parks, taxis, and on the Montreal metro, and they continue to put on impromptu shows at poutineries and pizzerias.5 Their sound has been described as ecclectic yet accessible; a mix between Cocorosie and the Beastie Boys. 6 Vincent Legault and Liu-Kong Ha (both classically trained musicians, having studied percussion and guitar jazz at McGill University and the Conservatoire de musique du Qu&lt;U+00E9&gt;bec &lt;U+00E0&gt; Montr&lt;U+00E9&gt;al)7 later joined the band, rounding out their sound to include instruments as diverse as the xylophone, melodica, ombichord, steel drums, and kazoo.8 In February of 2014, the band announced the addition of a 5th member, Florent Legault, as well as revealing that Frannie and Fab were once romantically linked but have since ended their relationship, remaining close friends.9
Touring
The quartet have toured throughout Quebec and the rest of Canada, as well as in the United States, France, Belgium, and Iceland. They have also performed several times at the prestigious Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Festival d'&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; de Qu&lt;U+00E9&gt;bec (2010 and 2011), as well as at M for Montreal (2010 and 2011), and the Halifax Pop Explosion (2010).10 On Parliament Hill in Ottawa in July 2011, Random Recipe participated in the Canada Day Celebrations, performing to an audience that included William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.11 In 2011 they played at the SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, and will return in March 2014 to play the SXSW festival once more.12

Random Recipe has also been awarded several prizes for their performances, including the 2011 Miroir for the Best Canadian Artist Prize and RIDEAU's 2011 &lt;U+00C9&gt;toiles Galaxie prize.
