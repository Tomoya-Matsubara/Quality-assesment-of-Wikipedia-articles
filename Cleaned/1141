Mercyful Fate is a Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann.12 Influenced by prog3 and hard rock,4 with lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult,56 Mercyful Fate were part of the first wave of black metal in the early-to-mid 1980s.7 Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in the Norway.89 Since the band's inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate have released seven studio albums, two extended plays and four compilations.
After several line-up changes and self-made demos, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982, with the line-up of King Diamond (vocals), Hank Shermann (guitar), Michael Denner (guitar), Timi Hansen (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums). With this line-up the group recorded their first two studio albums (1983's Melissa and 1984's Don't Break the Oath), until 1985 when the band broke-up due to musical differences. In 1993, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited to record the album In the Shadows, which was released the same year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Since 1999, Mercyful Fate have been on hiatus, but have reunited on occasion during the 2000s.
History
Formation and first releases (1981-1985)
Mercyful Fate was originally formed in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1981, following the dissolution of the band Brats.10 Brats had been a punk/metal band, featuring future Mercyful Fate members, vocalist King Diamond, and guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner.11 After two studio albums and several line-up changes (including the addition of Diamond and the departure of Denner), Diamond and Shermann began writing new material that was much heavier than any of Brats' previous work.12 The band's record label CBS was not pleased with the material, and demanded they stop singing in English and become more commercial.13 As a result, Diamond and Shermann quit the group and went on to form Mercyful Fate.14 After several line-up changes and semi-professional demo tapes, Mercyful Fate released their self-titled EP in 1982.1516 This line-up, consisting of King Diamond, Hank Shermann, bassist Timi Hansen, drummer Kim Ruzz and guitarist Michael Denner,17 would go on to record the group's first two studio albums.
In July, 1983, Mercyful Fate recorded their debut album at Easy Sound Recording, in Copenhagen, Denmark.18 Entitled Melissa, the album was produced by Henrik Lund and released on October 30, 1983 on Roadrunner Records.19 After a number of concerts around Denmark, Mercyful Fate entered the studio in May 1984 to record their second studio album Don't Break the Oath, which was released on September 7, 1984.20 During the album's supporting tour, the band played the US for two months and made festival appearances in Germany.21 Despite winning a cult following around the world, Mercyful Fate broke-up in April, 1985, due to musical differences.222324 Guitarist Hank Shermann wanted the band to move to a more commercial sound,25 to which King Diamond refused and announced his departure from Mercyful Fate, which led to the band breaking-up.26
After disbanding (1985-1992)
After Mercyful Fate broke-up in 1985, King Diamond, along with Michael Denner and Timi Hansen, formed the eponymous King Diamond band.2728 Both Denner and Hansen stayed with the group until 1987's Abigail, after which both left King Diamond.29 They were replaced by Mike Moon and Hal Patino, respectively, and King Diamond continued releasing albums even after Mercyful Fate had reformed.30 After leaving King Diamond, Michael Denner opened up a recordshop in Copenhagen, until 1988, when he formed the band Lavina (which would later become Zoser Mez), along with former bandmate Hank Shermann.3132 Hank Shermann had formed the hard rock band Fate in 1985, after having left Mercyful Fate.33 With Fate, Shermann released two albums: 1985's Fate and 1986's A Matter of Attitude.34 After leaving the band, Shermann joined-up with Michael Denner to form Lavina.35
During the time Mercyful Fate were disbanded, Roadrunner Records released three Mercyful Fate compilation albums. The Beginning was released on June 24, 1987, and featured material from the band's 1982 self-titled EP, as well as rare live and studio recordings.36 On May 12, 1992, Return of the Vampire was released, which was another compilation of rare studio recordings.37 On October 6, 1992, Roadrunner released A Dangerous Meeting; a split-release featuring material from both Mercyful Fate and King Diamond.38
Reunion (1993-1999)
 In 1993, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner and Timi Hansen reunited to reform Mercyful Fate (drummer Kim Ruzz was replaced by Morten Nielsen).3940 The result was the album In the Shadows, which was released on June 22, 1993, through Metal Blade Records.41 The album also featured a guest appearance by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich (a fellow Dane), on the track &quot;Return of the Vampire&quot;.42 For the album's supporting tour, Morten Nielsen was replaced by King Diamond drummer Snowy Shaw, due to a knee injury Nielsen had sustained.43 Bassist Timi Hansen was also replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo, as Hansen did not want to take part in touring.4445 On June 27, 1994, the band released The Bell Witch, an EP of live tracks, as well as studio recordings from In the Shadows.46
On September 25, 1994, Mercyful Fate released the album Time, which was recorded and mixed at the Dallas Sound Lab during May&lt;U+2013&gt;August 1994.47 After the album's release drummer Snowy Shaw was replaced by Bjarne T. Holm for the Time Tour.48 Holm had originally been asked to join Mercyful Fate back in 1981, but had declined due to prior commitments.49 The band spent January through February 1996 recording and mixing the album Into the Unknown, which was released on August 20, 1996.50 After the album's release, guitarist Michael Denner left the band and was replaced by Mike Wead.51 In October 1997, Mercyful Fate began recording the album Dead Again at the Nomad Recording Studio in Carrollton, Texas.52 Dead Again was released on June 9, 1998.53 In February 1999, Mercyful Fate began recording the album 9, which was released on May 15, 1999.54
Recent activity (1999-present)
After the supporting tour for 9, Mercyful Fate was put on hiatus. King Diamond focused on his eponymous band, along with guitarist Mike Wead, who joined the group during the European House of God tour.55 Hank Shermann and Bjarne T. Holm reunited with Michael Denner to form Force of Evil, while Sharlee D'Angelo joined the band Arch Enemy.56 When asked about the current state of the band in 2008, Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently &quot;hibernating&quot;, and that &quot;it's definitely not finished, at least in my book.&quot;57 In August 2008, King Diamond was asked by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich if Mercyful Fate would be willing to participate in Activision's Guitar Hero: Metallica video game.58 Ulrich requested the original masters for two of the band's songs, so they could be used in the game.59 Unable to locate them, Diamond suggested to Activision the band re-record the songs, and as a result, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner, Timi Hansen and Bjarne T. Holm reunited to re-record the songs &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;Curse of the Pharaohs&quot;.60 King Diamond was also made into a playable character in the game.61
On December 7, 2011, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner and Timi Hansen reunited onstage at Metallica's 30th Anniversary concert, at the Fillmore in San Francisco, California, where they performed a medley of Mercyful Fate songs.62
Style and legacy
Mercyful Fate were a part of the first wave of black metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer.63 Many of these groups helped established the style on which future black metal artists would later build upon.64 Unlike the other first wave bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock,65 epic 1970s hard rock66 and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult6768 and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint,69 Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal,7071 although their musical style was not as much an influence as that of other first wave bands.72
Various musicians have cited Mercyful Fate as an influence. Kerry King, the guitarist for the thrash metal band Slayer, has stated, that he and Jeff Hanneman were big fans of Mercyful Fate when Slayer recorded the album Hell Awaits, so much so that the album was very influenced by Mercyful Fate.73 Fellow thrash metal band Metallica recorded a medley of Mercyful Fate songs on their 1998 Garage Inc. cover album. Since then, the band has performed the song various times live with several members of Mercyful Fate.747576
