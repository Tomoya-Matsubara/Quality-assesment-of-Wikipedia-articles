Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves de Lima e Silva, the Duke of Caxias ( or ; August 25, 1803 &lt;U+2013&gt; May 7, 1880), nicknamed &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; and &quot;Iron Duke&quot;, was a monarchist, military officer and politician of the Empire of Brazil. He was one of the main leaders of the Conservative Party and on more than one occasion served as President of the Council of Ministers (Prime minister). Considered one of the most important heroes in Brazilian military history, Caxias fought in the Cisplatine War, the War of the Ragamuffins, Platine War, and, most notably, in the Paraguayan War. He was the only Brazilian not related to the House of Braganza to receive the title of Duke, and the only Duke to be created in the reign of Emperor Pedro II. Caxias entered the military while in adolescence, and rapidly rose to the ranks of General and Baron, subsequently becoming Marshal, Count, Marquis, Senator, and Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor. He was twice Minister of War and also President of the Council, exerting great political influence as a conservative leader. Caxias was superseded as commander of the Brazilian Forces by the Count d'Eu after the capture of Asunci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n, and received the title of Duke in 1869. The &quot;Day of the Soldier&quot; is an annual celebration that occurs on his birthday, August 25. The cities of Duque de Caxias and Caxias do Sul are named in his honor. He is honoured as the Patron of the Brazilian Army.
Early years
Family background
The earliest known patrilineal ancestor of the Duke of Caxias is his great-grandfather, Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o da Silva da Fonseca. He was a sergeant major (equivalent to a major in today's army) assigned to an artillery regiment in Lagos, a town in the Algarve of southern Portugal. He may have been a wealthy merchant and his position as an officer in his regiment may explain why his eldest son began his career with the rank of alferes (the modern equivalent of Second Lieutenant), a privilege open to few in Portugal's highly hierarchical society. Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o da Silva had two sons and two daughters. Both male children embarked upon a military career. The brothers had neither noble rank nor noble ancestry and lacked patrons in an environment in which advancement depended upon exchanges of favors and family connections. Rather than pursuing a career in the Portuguese homeland, far better opportunities for rising through the ranks were available in defending the far-flung Portuguese colonies.
The eldest son, Francisco de Lima da Silva (later Lima e Silva), brought his younger brother Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim de Lima da Silva to Brazil, then a Portuguese colony, in 1767. The two settled in Rio de Janeiro, capital of both the Rio de Janeiro captaincy (later province) and of the Viceroyalty of Brazil. They lived for several years in the South American colony and fought against the Spaniards on its southern frontiers. Francisco de Lima was retired and returned to Portugal in 1777, where he died&lt;U+2014&gt;unmarried&lt;U+2014&gt;two years later.
His younger brother, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim, opted to stay in Brazil. He slowly advanced through the ranks and in 1785 managed to enter into an advantageous marriage to Joana Maria da Fonseca Costa, a member of an influential family who had resided in Rio de Janeiro since the 17th century. Joaquim named his first-born son, Francisco de Lima da Silva, after his older brother. In 1801, Francisco was married to Mariana C&lt;U+00E2&gt;ndido de Oliveira Belo, whose prominent family was originally from the captaincy of Minas Gerais. The eldest male child of Francisco and Mariana was the future Duke of Caxias.
Birth and childhood
Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves de Lima e Silva was born on 25 August 1803 to Francisco de Lima e Silva and Mariana C&lt;U+00E2&gt;ndido de Oliveira Belo. His birthplace was a farm called S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo (today within the city of Duque de Caxias) located in the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' godparents were his paternal grandfather, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim, and his maternal grandmother, Ana Quit&lt;U+00E9&gt;ria Joaquina.
Although he would eventually become one of the most important figures in Brazilian history, there is only scant information regarding Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' life prior to age 36, at which point he was chosen to suppress the Balaiada rebellion. It is known that Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was the second eldest child (but first son) out of ten children to his parents. His early years were spent on the S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo farm owned by his maternal grandfather, and namesake, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves de Freitas. The young boy may have been initially schooled at home, as was common then. He also may have learned to read and write from his grandmother, Ana Quit&lt;U+00E9&gt;ria.
The arrival of the Portuguese Royal Family in Rio de Janeiro in 1808 changed the lives of the Lima family. King Dom Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o VI embarked upon a series of wars of conquest which resulted in the expansion of Brazil's territory with the annexation of Cisplatina to the south and of French Guiana to the north. By 1818, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' relatives had been ennobled. His grandfather, Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim became a member of the Order of Christ and fidalgo cavaleiro da Casa Real (knight noble of the Royal House). His father, Francisco, and uncles were also granted honors. Within a span of two generations, the Lima family had risen from mere commoners into the ranks of Portugal's untitled nobility.
Military education
In 1808, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was enlisted at the age of 5 as a cadet in the 1st Regiment of Infantry of Rio de Janeiro. Historian Adriana Barreto de Souza explained that this did &quot;not mean that he began to serve as a child, the connection to the regiment was simply honorific&quot;, a perquisite open to Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves as the son of a military officer. This infantry regiment was informally known as the &quot;Lima [family] Regiment&quot; because so many members of the family served in it, including Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' father and grandfather.
In 1811, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves moved with his parents from his grandparents' farm to Rio de Janeiro and was enrolled at the Semin&lt;U+00E1&gt;rio S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Joaquim (Saint Joachim's School). Seven years later, in 1818, he was admitted into the Royal Military Academy as an alferes (equivalent to a Second Lieutenant today). The next year he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant (nowadays First Lieutenant).
In the Royal Military Academy he followed the course of Infantry. To graduate as an infantryman, he was supposed to take classes of the 1st and 5th year, which he did, in 1818 and 1819, respectively. Although the entire course (which ran from the 1st to 7th year) was only mandatory to artillerymen and engineers, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves opted to take classes of the 2nd year in 1820 and of the 3th year in 1821. He took classes that ranged from arithmetic, algebra and geometry to tactics, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign and terrain reconnaissance. Albeit an accomplished student, the young Lieutenant was often reprimanded for bullying newbies.
Between family and loyalty to the crown
Independence of Brazil
Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves would normally have begun his 4th year classes at the Royal Military Academy sometime in March 1822. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves dropped out of the academy in December 1821 and enlisted in the 1st Fusilier Battalion. Prince Dom Pedro, son and heir of King Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o VI, had just embarked upon the struggle against Portugal that led to the independence of Brazil on 7 September 1822. The Prince was later acclaimed Dom Pedro I, first Brazilian emperor, on 12 October. Those Brazilian and Portuguese forces who remained loyal to Portugal refused to accept this outcome, which led to a war fought on several fronts across Brazil's provinces.
On 18 January 1823, Pedro I created the &quot;Emperor's Battalion&quot;, an elite infantry unit composed of men handpicked by himself. One of those selected for the new battalion was Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves. He was named as adjutant to the company's commander, who happened to be his uncle, Colonel Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim de Lima e Silva. The Emperor's Battalion was sent to the province of Bahia (in the Brazilian northeast) on 28 January. Upon arrival, it was placed, along with other troops, under the command of French Brigadier General Pierre Labatut. The Brazilian Imperial forces besieged Bahia's capital, Salvador, which was held by the Portuguese. During the siege, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves fought in at least three attacks (on 28 March, 3 May and 3 June) against Portuguese positions around Salvador, all successful. In the engagement on 28 March, he stormed entrenched Portuguese positions in a bayonet assault. In the final battle on 3 June (which was also the last land combat in this theater of war) he led a charge, with sword drawn, on an enemy bunker.
During the Bahia campaign, high ranking officers mutinied against Commander-in-Chief Labatut, who was taken prisoner and sent back to Rio de Janeiro. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' uncle Joaquim (the commander of the Emperor's Battalion) was almost certainly part of the conspiracy and was chosen by the officers to replace Labatut. It is unknown if Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was also involved. It is probable that he did not participate since, unlike his uncle and other relatives in the army, he was not rewarded with any commission by the conspirators. The campaign resumed, and the Portuguese withdrew from Salvador and set sail back to Portugal. On 2 July. the victorious Brazilians entered the city. The Emperor's Battalion returned to Rio de Janeiro, and Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was later promoted to Captain in early 1824.
Cisplatine War and father's betrayal
The Portuguese garrison in Montevideo, which was the capital of Cisplatina (then Brazil's southernmost province), was the last to surrender. In 1825, secessionists in the province rebelled. The United Provinces of South America (later Argentina) attempted to annex Cisplatina. Brazil declared war on the United Provinces, triggering the Cisplatine War. The Emperor's Battalion, to which Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was still attached, was sent to guard Montevideo, then besieged by rebel forces. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves fought in engagements against the insurgents during 1827 (7 February, 5 July, 7 July, 14 July, 5 August and 7 August).
The dates are unknown for two other actions in which Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves participated. The first of these was a raid in which he led a few soldiers against a docked corsair and its crew of 50 men. The Brazilian forces passed through enemy lines unnoticed and captured both the ship and its crew. The second action was a night attack against a rebel position in which he managed to capture more than 30 enemy soldiers.
During his stay in Montevideo, he met Mar&lt;U+00ED&gt;a &lt;U+00C1&gt;ngela Furriol Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez Luna, of Spanish ancestry and daughter of Magdalena Gonz&lt;U+00E1&gt;lez Luna Zaias, Marchioness of Montes Claros. How far their relationship progressed is unknown (if there was any relationship at all), but Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was infatuated with the young woman, who was often described as very beautiful. The war came to a disastrous end in 1828 with Brazil's relinquishment of Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of Uruguay. Nonetheless, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was promoted to the rank of major in late 1828.
Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves returned to Rio de Janeiro and witnessed the increasing decline in Emperor Pedro I's political position. A growing opposition to Pedro I's policies eventually erupted into mass protests in the Field of Santana, in downtown Rio de Janeiro, on 6 April 1831. The situation grew more ominous when several military units joined the protests. Although forgiven by the Emperor, and even advanced by him despite their role in the plot against Labatut in 1823, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves's father and uncles betrayed the Pedro I and joined the rebellion. The Emperor considered appointing Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves to command the Emperor's Battalion and asked him which side he would choose.
According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves answered that &quot;between the love of his father and his duty to the crown, he would stay with the latter.&quot; Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves also volunteered to lead the militia against the rebel troops. Pedro I expressed gratitude for his loyalty, but instead ordered him to lead the Emperor's Battalion to go to the Field of Santana and join the rebels. Pedro I preferred abdication to civil war, and a few hours later, during the early hours of 7 April, he renounced the throne. Many decades later, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves would say in the Brazilian Senate: &quot;I marched along with the Emperor's Batallion to the Field of Santana, out of devotion to competent orders [from Pedro I]. I was not a revolutionary. I esteemed the Abdication. I judged that it would be of advantage to Brazil, but I did not concur directly or indirectly with it.&quot;
Anarchy
 A regency of three was elected to rule until the five-year-old Dom Pedro II (Pedro I's son) reached the age of majority and the ability to rule in his own right. One of the regents chosen was Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' father, Francisco de Lima e Silva. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, &quot;it was less Lima e Silva's character and talents than the hope that he could through his numerous relatives among the officer corps secure the loyalty of the army that prompted his selection.&quot; The hope that the army could be controlled was in vain. Historian C. H. Haring remarked: the &quot;army, demoralized by the far from exemplary part it had played in the April Revolution [i.e. Pedro I's abdication], got entirely out of hand, and there were repeated mutinies in the garrisons. [...] Arrogant and undisciplined, believing that everything could be settled by resorts of arms, it became the ready tool of any popular agitator or demagogue, and often the source of riot and sedition.&quot;
The government severely reduced the size of the standing army contigent, and effectively replaced it with the newly created National Guard, a militia force. In October 1831, and without troops to command, officers (including Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves) joined the Volunteer Officer-Soldiers Battalion, acting as soldiers. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was appointed commander of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, a police force in the city of Rio de Janeiro, in October 1832.
On 6 January 1833, at age 29, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves married Ana Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa de Loreto Carneiro Viana, aged 16 and younger sister of an Army officer friend. She was also a member of an aristocratic family of Rio de Janeiro. The marriage took place contrary to the wishes of the bride's mother, who saw Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves and his family as upstarts. Newspapers connected to political enemies of his family took advantage of this disagreement to level serious, but unfounded, accusations against him, including that he had kidnapped Ana Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa. Despite the invective, their marriage was a happy one and three children resulted: Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;sa de Loreto Viana de Lima, Ana de Loreto Viana de Lima and Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves de Lima e Silva, born in 1833, 1836 and 1847, respectively.
Around this time Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was appointed instructor in swordsmanship and horsemanship to the young Pedro II. Ties of duty had drawn the two men together, but a long-lasting friendship and personal devotion also developed. Although not a man of letters, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves had many other positive traits that Pedro II would come to appreciate. The future Duke of Caxias was considered a very reasonable and honest person. Historian Thomas Whigham described him as someone who &quot;learned the art of giving orders early in life. Immaculate in his dress, he was soft spoken, polite, and smoothly in control of himself. He seemed to radiate calm composure and authority.&quot; Pedro II would write about him many years later: &quot;I believe Caxias to be loyal and my friend, especially because he is so little a politician.&quot; According to historian Heitor Lyra, he was &quot;one of the rare, sincere and profoundly convicted monarchists and friends of the King [i.e., the Emperor] and of the Dynasty [the House of Braganza] He placed his sword not only in service to a united and strong Brazil, but also to a worthy and respected Monarch&quot;.
The Brazilian capital, followed by several provinces across the country, had meanwhile become a stage for countless rebellions and attempted coups. A republican secessionist rebellion that began in 1834 in the province of Rio Grande do Sul (whicht became known as the War of the Ragamuffins) was joined by an uncle of Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves. His father, and possibly another uncle (who was Minister of War at the time), secretly supported the rebellion. A younger brother of Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves, also an Army officer, murdered a man in cold blood in a dispute over political grievances.
Quelling rebellions
Balaiada
 By the late 1830s Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves, as the commander of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, had managed to bring peace and order to Rio de Janeiro streets. This accomplishment was a result of Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' skills and his partnership with Rio chief of police, Eus&lt;U+00E9&gt;bio de Queir&lt;U+00F3&gt;s. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' success brought the attention of Queir&lt;U+00F3&gt;s' political faction, the Coimbra bloc (the core what would later become the Conservative Party). The main leader of the Coimbra bloc, Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, who was also heading the Brazilian government, attempted to attract Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves to his faction. A military officer in 19th century Brazil could not hope to advance through the ranks or be appointed to a prestigious command without being part of a political party. Thus Vasconcelos ordered Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves to quell a rebellion in the province of Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o.
Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was one of several Brazilian provinces which had fallen in turmoil since Pedro I's abdication. It was located in Brazil's far north (nowadays regarded as Northeast) and was engulfed in a civil war between local political factions which became known as Balaiada. The struggle degenerated into banditism to the point that political grievances were long ignored and the original perpetrators (the local political factions) were eager to restore order. Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was appointed to the two highest civilian and military positions in the province: president (governor) and military commander (comandante das armas), thus giving him authority over the provincial National Guard and Army, respectively.
The groups of bandits that roamed the province were defeated in several battles and skirmishes. To Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves' surprise, messages exchanged with the bandits' leaders revealed that not only they respected the authority of the child emperor, but also claimed that were fighting for him. He used this knowledge to pacify the province once the imperial government in Rio de Janeiro granted an amnesty to all involved in the provincial rebellion, including the bandits. The latter, or what still was left of any, surrended almost immediately once they learned that the Emperor himself had pardoned them. For his acchievement, Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves was named Baron of Caxias. A rare honor, he was allowed to chose his noble name, which he did after Caxias, Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's second largest town, which had fallen in rebel hands and was reconquered by him.
Liberal rebellions of 1842
Being far away from the imperial capital did not prevent Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Alves (or Caxias) from being dragged into Brazilian politics. During the entire time he spent in Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o he was informed through letters by three persons of the last events, all of them eager to induce him into their political groups. The first was Caxias' father, a member of what would become the Liberal Party. The second was Paulo Barbosa da Silva, then-steward in the Imperial Palace and a former colleague of Caxias in the Royal Military Academy, who belonged to the Courtier Faction. The third was Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o (later the Marquis of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;), a distant cousin of Caxias' wife (herself a granddaughter of Br&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, kin to Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio's father), of the Coimbra bloc.
When he returned from Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, Caxias saw the political milieu had changed. The Emperor had been prematurely declared of age and had appointed a cabinet formed by members of the Liberal Party and of the Courtier Faction, thus removing the Coimbra bloc from power. A crisis within the cabinet made Pedro II appoint a new one composed of members of the Coimbra bloc. In retaliation, the Liberals rebelled in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo and Minas Gerais. Caxias was ordered to quell the rebellion in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo. Having defeated the rebels there, he marched to Minas Gerais and was once again successful. In the latter he was aided by a militia led by Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, from which a strong friendship between both men would appear. Despite the mountaineous terrain on both provinces, quite different from the open fields in Cisplatina or the Amazon Rainforest jungles of Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, Caxias was extremely successful.
At least since his stay in Maranh&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, Caxias had grown closer to the Coimbra bloc. After the rebellions in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo and Minas Gerais he was certainly among its ranks. He had become tired of seeing so many innocent civilian deaths caused by liberal rebellions since the 1830s. The Coimbra bloc, now self-styled &quot;Party of Order&quot;, had principles more akin to Caxias since it supported liberalism, exceptionalism, state authority, and representative, parliamentary monarchy. Even though a member of a political party opposed to the Liberal Party, Caxias kept a respectful, even loving relationship toward his father.
War of the Ragamuffins
Conservatism
Platine War
Conciliation
 On 6 September 1853, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was appointed President of the Council of Ministers and charged with organizing a new cabinet. Emperor Pedro II wished to advance an ambitious plan, which became known as &quot;the Conciliation&quot;. The goal of the Conciliation was to put an end to the periodic eruption of armed conflicts between political factions, such as had occurred in the Praieira rebellion. It had become usual for parties which had lost power in elections to attempt to forcibly seize back control. The Conciliation aimed to strengthen the role of parliament in settling the country's political disputes. Both parties would be required to agree to rise above partisan politics and instead devote themselves to the common good of the nation.
The new President invited several Liberals to join the Conservative ranks and went so far as to name some as ministers. The new cabinet, albeit highly successful, was plagued from the beginning by strong opposition from Conservative Party members who repudiated the new recruits from the Liberal side, believing that these were mainly interested in gaining public offices, rather than truly supporting the party's goals. Despite the mistrust, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o managed to govern, demonstrating great resilience in fending off threats and overcoming obstacles and setbacks.
After the sudden and unexpected death of Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o in September 1856, his cabinet only managed to survive him by a few months. The Emperor, although critical of the way the Conciliation had been implemented, had learned to appreciate its merits and was eager that it continue.
Rise of the Progressive League
 During the years following 1857, the cabinets quickly collapsed due to the lack of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, dissident &quot;Moderate Conservatives&quot;. In the wake of Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, ambitious to gain more power in the Conservative Party. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control. Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Paranhos, a former colleague in the Conciliation Cabinet, managed to persuade Caxias to stay on the side of the ultraconservatives.
The Liberal Party had declined since the end of the 1840s, and its remaining members saw an opportunity in the Conservative Party's fragmentation to return to national politics with renewed strength. They delivered a powerful blow to the government when they managed to win several seats in the Chamber of Deputies in 1860. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Caxias chose Paranhos as his Minister of Finance, and he soon became the Marquis's right hand. His influence became so great that the ministry became known as the &quot;Caxias-Paranhos Cabinet&quot;.
The new government was faced with a major challenge: the Chamber of Deputies was divided into three groups: the ultraconservatives, the Moderates and the Liberals. Paranhos and Caxias named men who were either ultraconservatives or Moderates to the remaining portfolios, in an attempt to weaken the revigorated Liberal opposition and consolidate a workable governing majority. Despite successfully recruiting enough supporters from outside the party to form a government, the Cabinet was hobbled from the outset by its lack of internal unity. It was doomed when Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Tom&lt;U+00E1&gt;s Nabuco de Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo delivered a speech advocating a merger of Moderate Conservatives and Liberals into a truly new political party.
So enthusiastically well-received was this speech, that both groups voted together as a single, cohesive faction, leaving the government without a majority. The Cabinet requested that the Emperor dissolve the Chamber and call for new elections, but he refused. With no remaining alternative, Caxias and his ministers resigned, and on 24 May 1862 Pedro II named a member of the Moderate-Liberal coalition to form a new cabinet. The new political party was called the &quot;Progressive League&quot;. Barely a month later, Caxias's only son died suddenly at age 14 of an unknown disease. There was a small consolation at the end of 1862 when, on 2 December, he was promoted to Marshal of the Army, the highest rank in the Brazilian army.
Paraguayan War
Siege of Uruguaiana
In December 1864, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez took advantage of Brazil's military intervention in Uruguay to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.
The situation in Rio Grande do Sul was chaotic and the local military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance against the Paraguayan army. Pedro II, aware of the danger, decided to go to the front in person to shore up operations. As the Emperor's military Aide-de-Camp, Caxias followed his monarch into the combat zone.
The Imperial party arrived in Rio Grande do Sul's capital, Porto Alegre, in July 1865. From there, they traveled inland until they reached Uruguaiana in September. The trip was an uneasy experience for Caxias. The Emperor's entourage also included the War Minister, &lt;U+00C2&gt;ngelo Ferraz (later the Baron of Uruguaiana). A member of the Progressive League still in power, Ferraz was a personal enemy of Caxias. They loathed each other and, now forced to keep company, argued. Pedro II ignored the conflict and did not intervene to stop their quarrelling.
The Emperor's behavior bothered Caxias. In the beginning he wrote that Pedro II &quot;continues to treat me in the best way possible and does not listen to anyone else but me on military affairs, which has greatly annoyed Ferraz&quot;. However, days later he remarked: &quot;He [Pedro II] only cares about himself, and no one else.&quot; Used to being the preeminent counsel in wartime, Caxias was undermined by his vanity and soon barely able to hide his displeasure at being overshadowed by another. A delighted Ferraz noticed: &quot;Caxias is very sullen. In part he is right, but he has only himself to blame. One should never play the role of subordinate or valet in a place where one once was king.&quot;
The Brazilian town of Uruguayana had been occupied by a Paraguayan army. By the time Caxias and his party arrived, the town was under siege by a combined force made up of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units&lt;U+2014&gt;the latter had allied with Brazil against Paraguay. The Paraguayans surrendered without further bloodshed, freeing the Emperor and Caxias to return to the Imperial capital.
Commander-in-Chief
  The Allies next invaded Paraguay in April 1866 and, after an initial success, their advance was blocked by fortifications at Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt;, which blocked further progress both by land and along the River Paraguay. A fort at Curuz&lt;U+00FA&gt; was taken initially, but an attempt on 22 September against Curupaiti was repulsed. The failure to take Curupaiti caused the morale of the troops to reach its lowest point, and the Brazilian generals quarreled and could not agree on further action. To address the situation, the Progressive cabinet decided to create a unified command over Brazilian land forces operating in Paraguay, and it turned to Caxias as the new head.
The 63-year old Caxias was named Commander-in-Chief of Brazil's armies in Paraguay on 10 October 1866. &quot;Among the staff of the Armed Forces of the Empire&quot;, said historian Ricardo Salles, &quot;only Caxias presented leadership and military competence to reorganize and encourage the command structure, regularize and improve the logistic basis of the army, infuse courage among the officer corps, adequately train and equip the soldiers for a long war in hostile terrain and against a warlike enemy.&quot; He explained to his wife that the reason he had accepted the post was because the war &quot;was an evil that has reached more or less all, from the Emperor to the most unfortunate slave.&quot;
Caxias arrived in Paraguay on 17 November, and assumed, for all practical purposes, the supreme command of both land and naval forces in the war, even though he had not explicitly been given authority over the navy. His first measure was to dismiss Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (later the Marquis of Tamandar&lt;U+00E9&gt; and also member of the Progressive League) and appoint fellow Conservative, Vice-Admiral Joaquim Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; In&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio (later the Viscount of Inha&lt;U+00FA&gt;ma), to lead the navy. From October 1866 until July 1867, all offensive operations were suspended. During this period, Caxias trained the soldiers, re-equipped the army with newer guns, improved the quality of the officer corps, and upgraded the health corps and overall hygiene of the troops, putting an end to epidemics. Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay (later the Viscount of Taunay), who fought in the war, said that Caxias was a &quot;generous military chief, who forgave small errors, but was implacable with those who commited grave misdeeds, or, then, who betrayed his confidence.&quot;
With the Brazilian army ready for combat, Caxias began the operation to encircle Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt; and force its capitulation by siege. The first move was made against the abandoned Paraguayan village of Tuy&lt;U+00FA&gt; Cu&lt;U+00E9&gt;, which was occupied on 29 July 1867. The combined Brazilian-Argentine-Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory in the effort to surround Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt;. When the Paraguayan position at Tah&lt;U+00ED&gt; was taken on 2 November, Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt; was completely cut off from overland reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay river under heavy fire, assuming full control of the river and thus isolating Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt; from resupply by water.
Dezembrada
  The relationship between the Marquis of Caxias&lt;U+2014&gt;now the Allied Commander-in-Chief&lt;U+2014&gt;and the governing Progressive cabinet worsened until it became a political crisis. Soon after Caxias was chosen to lead the Brazilian forces in 1866, Ferraz was relieved of the War ministry portfolio to avoid complications arising from the friction between the two men. As time passed, Caxias became irritated by the constant criticisms directed at him by newspapers connected to the Progressives. He tendered his resignation, but the Progressive-led government refused to accept. Having lost credibility for prosecuting the war and plagued by party infighting, the Progressive Cabinet resigned. The Emperor called the Conservatives back into power on 16 July 1868.
Meanwhile in Paraguay, Caxias continued prosecuting the siege of Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt;. To prevent the annihilation of the troops defending the fortress, L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez managed to engineer a successful withdrawal of all Paraguayan troops by 24 July without being detected by Allied forces. The allies occupied the Paraguayan stronghold on the following day without firing a shot. The Conservatives had returned to power a few days before Humait&lt;U+00E1&gt; was taken, although Caxias only learned of this later .
Pressing his advantage, the Marquis began organizing an assault on the new Paraguayan defenses which L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of Asunci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored to the northwest by the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o Paraguay and on the southeast by the swampy jungle of the Chaco region, both of which were considered to be nearly impassible by a large force. By the last part of September, the allied armies were facing the entrenched Paraguayan forces at the Pikysyry. Rather than making a frontal attack on L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez's line, Caxias had a road cut through the Chaco region. The road was finished, undetected by L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez by early December, allowing the Allied forces to outflank the Paraguayan lines and attack from the rear. In three successive battles (Ytoror&lt;U+00F3&gt;, Avay and Lomas Valentinas), which became known as Dezembrada, the combined Allied forces completely annihilated the Paraguayan army. L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez himself barely managed to escape with a few followers, and on 1 January 1869, the Brazilians occupied Asunci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n.
The Marquis had to take great risks to accomplish those victories. In the Ytoror&lt;U+00F3&gt; engagement, which occurred on 5 December, the Allied objective was to take a bridge over Ytoror&lt;U+00F3&gt; river. Several attempts were made cross the bridge, but each was repelled by intense fire from the Paraguayan positions. In a final attempt, the Brazilian soldiers panicked and began to flee in disorder. Caxias, witnesseing the impending disaster, unsheathed his sword and charged on horseback toward the bridge, followed by his staff. He passed through the fleeing troops shouting &quot;Long live His Majesty&quot;, &quot;Long Live Brazil&quot; and finally, &quot;Those who are true Brazilians follow me!&quot; The display stopped the retreat immediately, allowed the units to regroup and, in a vigorous attack led personally by Caxias, overwhelmed the Paraguayan positions.
The Brazilian army's low morale and unwillingness to engage forced the Marquis to personally head &quot;the assault, in a suicide move in which, surprisingly, he survived&quot;, said historian Francisco Doratioto. Doratioto also states that had &quot;Caxias been hit when he crossed the bridge, as happened to other officers, almost certainly the army would have dispersed, run away in disorder, which would have had unpredictable consequences in the development of the war.&quot; Several men who were next to the Commander-in-Chief during the attack were killed, as well as his own horse. The loss of fighting spirit among the troops was a result, according to Caxias, of the long duration of the war, the lack of enough capable officers who could provide role models to their men and, most importantly, the existence of former slaves among the ranks. They had been freed to fight in the war, but were often insubordinate, and the Marquis deduced that this occurred because they were &quot;men who do not comprehend what is fatherland, society and family; who still regard themselves as slaves, but who have only changed masters.&quot;
Aftermath
 Caxias was growing old, and was ill and exhausted by the time he reached Asunci&lt;U+00F3&gt;n. As he did not feel up to the task of pursuing L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez into the Paraguayan hinterland, he asked to be either relieved of his post or to take a short leave in order to recover. Many of the officers in Brazil's Paraguayan force had become casualties during the previous year, and it was thought that the presence of the Commander-in-Chief was necessary. Although his request was denied, Caxias appointed a senior member of his staff as acting-commander and left for Brazil on 19 January 1869. The Emperor was angered that the Marquis had left his post without permission, and especially that Caxias had declared the war to have been already won&lt;U+2014&gt;even though L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez was still at large and regrouping his remaining military assets. With victory having been thus declared, Caxias's subordinates began preparing for what they assumed would be an imminent return to Brazil. The lack of will to follow-up on the Allied victories seriously endangered the hard-won achievements of the past months, even as the objective of eliminating L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez as a threat remained tantalizingly within reach.
The Marquis arrived unannounced in Rio de Janeiro in early February. He went directly to his home, to the surprise of his wife, who&lt;U+2014&gt;like everyone else&lt;U+2014&gt;was not aware that he had returned. He remained at home for a month, refusing to leave. Pedro II was greatly disappointed in Caxias, though he was also very aware that the Marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war and that these accomplishments had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the Marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Pa&lt;U+00E7&gt;o de S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Crist&lt;U+00F3&gt;v&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, on 21 February 1869 and they reconciled.
A few days later, Caxias was awarded the Order of Pedro I and was raised from marquis to duke, the highest rank in Brazilian nobility. These were distinctions that no other individual received during the long, 58-year reign of Pedro II. Historian Heitor Lyra said that &quot;the title of Duke gave Caxias incalculable prestige. It overshadowed, to a certain extent, its own designation [Caxias], already by itself glorious. He became, from that point, the Duke. There was no necessity to say his name. The title was enough&lt;U+2014&gt;the Duke. The Duke, in Brazil, was him, could be only him, as the Duke, in England of George IV, could only be Wellington.&quot;
Nonetheless, this did not shelter him from being subjected to attacks and accusations&lt;U+2014&gt;some petty&lt;U+2014&gt;from Liberals in Parliament, including for having left his post without permission. The embittered Duke wrote to Os&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio: &quot;When I was young, my friend, I did not know how to explain the reason why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me&quot;. To historian Francisco Doratioto, the &quot;attacks on Caxias were exaggerated. In Paraguay, he was a successful and competent commander, who made mistakes, it is true, but who never lost a campaign. [...] If some of these criticisms had arisen from strictly military aspects of the performance of this general, most were from political motivation, made by liberals, or even caused from personal envy.&quot;
Later years
Figurehead presidency
 Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Paranhos, now Viscount of Rio Branco, led a cabinet which lasted from 1871 to 1875. Although the government was quite successful, two serious crises arose that challenged its viability and undermined the foundations of the monarchy itself. The first was resulted from the controversy over the Law of Free Birth, which emancipated children born to slave women after its enactment. With half of its members supporting the law and the other half staunchly opposed, a serious rift was opened within the Conservative Party. The opponents represented the interests of powerful coffee farmers.
The second crisis developed after the government entered into a conflict with two bishops who had ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. The dispute grew out of proportion when both bishops were convicted and given prison sentences for having disobeyed the government's order to rescind their expulsions of Freemasons. As Catholicism was the state religion, the Emperor exercised, with the Papacy's acquiescence, a great deal of control over Church affairs&lt;U+2014&gt;paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying papal bulls, and overseeing seminaries. As a result of the furor over the handling of the affair, Rio Branco and his cabinet resigned, &quot;disunited and weary after four years in office&quot;, according to historian Roderick J. Barman. Pedro II asked Caxias to form a new cabinet. The duke later gave a remarkable account of their meeting:
The elderly Caxias, nearly 72 and widowed since 1874, was in poor health and could only serve as a figurehead president of the government which was created on 25 June 1875. According to Roderick J. Barman, for &quot;the new cabinet to possess any energy and direction, it needed to include a senior politician of force and standing. The emperor turned to the baron of Cotejipe&quot;, who had been Caxias' colleague in the Conciliation cabinet back in the 1850s, to fill the role of de facto president. The Caxias-Cotejipe cabinet attempted to placate the discord created by the previous cabinet. Their measures included financial aide to coffee farmers, an amnesty for the convicted bishops, and the selection of new ministers and a call for elections to please the pro-slavery Conservatives. Caxias, who was a Freemason himself but also a staunch Catholic, threatened to resign if the emperor did not grant the amnesty, which Pedro II grudgingly issued in September 1875.
Death
 &quot;I think like you that a new political situation it is coming soon. The ministry is a corpse that Caxias, despite all his glories and importance that he holds in the emperor's mind, will not be able to revitalize. The ministry lives only because of Caxias' name&quot;, wrote the liberal Nabuco de Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo to a party colleague in December 1878. According to Roderick J. Barman, the &quot;duke of Caxias was too old and too sick to provide leadership&quot;. His health problems became so troubling that he repeatedly to resign beginning in early 1876. At the end of 1877, Pedro II paid a visit to Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer stay in office and called the liberals to form a new cabinet on 1 January 1878.
Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. The duke no longer saw himself playing a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as being an essential factor in holding the nation together. The new politicians who had begun to dominate the government had little memory of times before Pedro II assumed control in 1840. Unlike their predecessors, had no experience of the Regency and early years of Pedro II's reign, when external and internal dangers threatened the nation's existence. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity. The young politicians saw no reason to uphold and defend the Imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation.
Times were changing fast, and Caxias was aware of the situation. He became increasingly nostalgic for the old times he had spent with his now-dead Conservative Party colleagues and held pessimistic views of future political prospects. When Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itabora&lt;U+00ED&gt;&lt;U+2014&gt;one of the last survivors of those conservative leaders who had begun their careers during the 1830s&lt;U+2014&gt;died in 1872, the duke wrote to a friend: &quot;Who will replace him? I dont know, I cannot see... The vacuum he left will not be filled, as it was not with Eus&lt;U+00E9&gt;bio, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;, Uruguai, Manuel Felizardo and many others who helped us sustain this little church [i.e., the monarchy, his &quot;second faith&quot;], collapsed or almost collapsed on 7 April 1831.&quot;
Confined to a wheel chair as his health slowly declined, the Duke of Caxias lived his remaining days at his Santa M&lt;U+00F4&gt;nica farm, located in the countryside of Rio de Janeiro province. On 7 May 1880 at 11 p.m., he quietly died, attended by members of his family. A saddened Pedro II (who visited Caxias several times during his long illness) remarked about his &quot;friend of almost a half century&quot;, that he had &quot;known him, and esteemed him since 1832. He was 76, almost 77-years old. And so we remain in this world.&quot; After a huge funeral procession, Caxias was buried in the S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Francisco de Paula cemetery in the city of Rio de Janeiro. On 25 August 1949, his remains, as well as those of his wife, were exhumed and reinterred in Rio de Janeiro's the Duke of Caxias Pantheon.
Legacy
 At the time of his death in 1880 until the 1920s the Duke of Caxias was not regarded as the most important military historical character in Brazilian history. This place belonged to Manuel Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Os&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio, Marquis of Erval. Caxias was barely remembered. His memory was slowly recovered and the first attempt happened in 1923 when the ministry of the Army created an annual celebration in honor of Caxias. In 1925 his birthday became officially the &quot;Day of the Soldier&quot;, which commemorates the Brazilian Army. On 13 March 1962 Caxias became Patrono (literally, &quot;Patron&quot;, a kind of &quot;patron saint&quot;) of the Brazilian Army, making him the most important figure in the army tradition. According to Adriana Barreto de Souza, Francisco Doratioto and Celso Castro the Duke of Caxias took the place of Os&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio because he was seen as a loyal and dutiful officer who could serve as a role model in the Brazilian republic plagued since its birth in 1889 by military insubordination, rebellions and coups d'&lt;U+00C9&gt;tat.
The historiography is often positive toward Caxias. Since the first well known biography published in 1878 he &quot;has been the subject of several hagiographic biographies&quot;, according to historian Roderick J. Barman. Nelson Werneck Sodr&lt;U+00E9&gt; said that Caxias, as a historical character, suffers from the same shortcomings as Pedro II. Both have been always presented as irreproachable men. Not that the historian regards them as unworthy, but to him somewhere in the process the human face of each was lost, giving place to &quot;this black and white figure, model of individual virtues&quot;.
Nonetheless, to Sodr&lt;U+00E9&gt; Caxias was &quot;not only the greatest military commander of his continent [South America], in his time, but [also] a great politician&quot;. Moreover, the Duke of Caxias was &quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;more than D. Pedro II&lt;U+2014&gt;the Empire.&quot; His respect to the law and his complete obedience to the civilian government were fundamental. &quot;Caxias, who could have been the most powerful caudillo,&quot; says Sodr&lt;U+00E9&gt;, &quot;exempts the country of caudillism. While, in the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata, the Urquizas, the Rosas, the Oribes, caused disaster to their nations and hindered their development, Caxias added to his prestige both his roles in the consolidation of the empire as well in its external victories without ever throwing his sword over the political balance nor taking [by force] political offices for himself.&quot;
According to Francisco Doratioto, the duke &quot;was uncompromising in the defense of the established order, but, once obtained the military vantage over the rebels, he attempted to reach a conciliation, avoiding inhuman treatment toward the prisioners and granting them amnesty&quot;. Also, in &quot;his conception the military power was subordinated to the civilian power, and the greatness of the country was associated with to the order and to the established authorities&quot;, something quite different from his Hispanic-American counterparts, as well of the Brazilian military of the late Empire and most of the republican era. The historian remarked as well that:
Ricardo Salles said that although his character &quot;evidenced a conservative mind, typical of a dominant group of a socially hierarchical society divided by slavery, there is no reason to deduce based on that he conducted the army without regard to reduce to the maximum the human losses, in battle or by diseases&quot;. &quot;On the contrary&quot;, affirmed the historian, &quot;the military behavior of Caxias, as it was expected from a competent commander, was guided by an adequate preparation of his actions, always carefully planned and executed [...]&quot;. He concluded: &quot;A man of his time, [...] Caxias fulfilled his duty.&quot;
Roderick J. Barman affirmed that Caxias was not only &quot;extremely powerful in the Conservative party&quot;, but also &quot;the country's most distinguished&quot; and &quot;most successful soldier&quot; that &quot;himself had proved his capacity and his loyalty by defeating revolts against the regime&quot; C. H. Haring said that he was &quot;a brilliant army officer&quot;, also &quot;Brazil's most famous military figure&quot; and a man &quot;who was genuinely loyal to the throne&quot; H&lt;U+00E9&gt;lio Vianna regarded Caxias as &quot;the greatest soldier of Brazil&quot;. To Thomas Whigham, the duke was &quot;destined to occupy a lofty spot in Brazil's national mythology. He often had to act as a statesman as much as military man&quot; and was &quot;[s]hrewdly competent in both roles&quot;.

Notes
The family name was &quot;Lima da Silva&quot;. After the birth of the Duke of Caxias all members changed the name to &quot;Lima e Silva&quot;.
In 1846 Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Joaquim de Lima (Caxias' uncle) claimed noble ancestry for his family, making connections that went as far as to the Visigothic as well as to Leonese monarchs. Historian Adriana Barreto de Souza said that although it might be true, by the 18th century the family had long lost its noble status. Thus, their achievements at the 19th century owned solely to their efforts, not due to a possible illustrious ancestry.
The disciplines in the 1st year of the Royal Military Academy were: arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and technical drawing. Of the 2nd year: (algebra, geometry, analytical geometry, differential and integral calculus, descriptive geometry and technical drawing. Of the 3rd year: (mechanics, ballistics and technical drawing. Of the 5th year: tactics, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign, terrain reconnaissance and chemistry. Lima e Silva dropped from the academy before taking classes in the 4th year.
All that is known is that Lima e Silva signed the minutes of a meeting among officers of the Right and Center Brigades who had decided to send a delegation to their Commander-in-Chief, Pierre Labatut, to plead him to reconcile with officers of the Left Brigade with whom he had become estranged. The meeting had barely ended when two officers of the Left Brigade arrived giving the news that Labatut had been arrested. To historian Affonso de Carvalho, Lima e Silva, whose name is the last in the minutes, signed under protest and felt uncomfortable with the idea of sending a delegation to talk with the commander-in-chief. Taking a part in a plot to remove Labatut from the command and arrest him is even more unlikely.
On the opposite direction is the marxist historiography that appeared in the 1960s and 1970s in Latin America. Although largely discredited nowadays, this historiography achieved great success in this time period. Its most well known Brazilian historian &quot;portrayed the conflict as a genocide deliberately perpetrated against the Paraguayan people and Brazil's slave and Afro-Brazilian populations.&quot; Historians Hendrik Kraay and Thomas Whigham called it an &quot;improbable assertion&quot;. Against Caxias the most serious allegation was that in a letter supposedly written by him he told that he had &quot;deliberately spread cholera in Corrientes and other [Argentine] provinces hostile to the war effort by having infected corpses thrown into the rivers.&quot; Historians Hendrik Kraay, Thomas Whigham and Ricardo Sallesdismissed this allegation since there is no proof of the existence of such letter. Lastly, &quot;no evidence that Brazilian commanders deliberately used back men as cannon fodder has come to light, and the number of slaves forced into the army and navy was quite small (about seven thousand)&quot;.
