The PZL M-17 &quot;Dudu&lt;U+015B&gt; Kud&lt;U+0142&gt;acz&quot; (initially EM-5A) was a Polish twin-boom pusher general aviation and trainer aircraft of 1977, which remained a prototype.
Design and development
The aircraft was an amateur design of a team of students of Warsaw University of Technology (Politechnika Warszawska) led by Edward Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski. It had quite unorthodox layout of a pusher with twin booms and very streamlined fuselage. A crew of two sat side-by-side, and had double controls. A tricycle landing gear was retractable.
The plane was designed in 1969-1971. At the design stage it was designated EM-5A (EM for Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski) and nicknamed Dudu&lt;U+015B&gt; Kud&lt;U+0142&gt;acz (Hairy Dudu&lt;U+015B&gt;). The aircraft factory PZL-Mielec in Mielec got interested in the design and took over its development, under a designation PZL M-17. The design was modified there with help of Marga&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, plastic and duralumin construction was changed to riveted duralumin one, and it was given weaker engine, than designed.
The only prototype was flown on 7 July 1977 by S. Wasil. It was not produced in series. In 1979 the prototype was given to Rzesz&lt;U+00F3&gt;w University of Technology. A shortcoming of a streamlined fuselage was a cramped cockpit, the crewmen were half-laying in a similar way, as in gliders.
The plane was a mid-wing monoplane. It had a two-blade wooden propeller and a fuel tank 310 l.
