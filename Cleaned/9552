The Tammar Wallaby (Macropus eugenii), also known as the Dama Wallaby or Darma Wallaby, is a small member of the kangaroo family and is the model species for research on kangaroos and marsupials. It is found on offshore islands on the South Australian and Western Australian coast. It persists in large numbers on Kangaroo Island, where it seasonally breeds in large numbers and can become a problem to farmers through competition for pasture and grain crops. High densities of these animals also have impact on the density of low vegetation across the Island. The Tammar Wallaby was seen on West Wallabi Island in the Houtman Abrolhos off Western Australia by survivors of the 1628 Batavia shipwreck, and recorded by Francisco Pelsart in his 1629 Ongeluckige Voyagie. This represents the first recorded sighting of a macropod by Europeans,1 and probably also the first sighting of an Australian mammal.2
Taxonomy
The tammar wallaby was first described by French naturalist Anselme Ga&lt;U+00EB&gt;tan Desmarest in 1817. It specific name comes from Eugene Hamelin, Commander of the ship Naturaliste.3 Its common name is derived from the thickets of the local shrub Allocasuarina campestris that it sheltered in in Western Australia.4 It is classified along with the kangaroos and larger wallabies in the genus Macropus. Within this, it is placed in the subgenus Notomacropus along with several species of wallaby, all members of which have a facial stripe.5
The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island were described as having a greyer coat and thinner head than the tammars on Kangaroo Island6 and were given a separate name, while East and West Wallabi Islands are smaller than the Kangaroo Island tammars. Other early naturalists suspected that all island populations composed one species.7 A more recent study has compared tammar wallaby skulls in museums around the world with skulls from extant populations on the Abrolhos Islands, Garden Island, Middle Island and Kangaroo Island as well as those from New Zealand and found that there were three distinct groups; one group made of populations from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island, a second ground composed of population form Flinders Island and mainland Southern Australia in the 19th century as well as populations from New Zealand and a third group composed of the Kangaroo Island population.8 
Subspecies
As such, three subspecies of tammar wallaby are currently recognised:9
M. e. derbianus (Western Australia and nearby islands)
M. e. decres (Kangaroo Island, South Australia)
M. e. eugenii (Extinct in South Australia and Flinders Island but introduced to New Zealand).
Evolution
Fossil evidence exists from the late Pleistocene, with remains found in the Naracoorte Caves.10 Island tammar wallabies have been isolated from those on the mainland for 15,000-7,000 years, since the end of the last Ice Age and each population shows genetic differences from each other.11 It is likely that tammars originated in South Australia and spread to Western Australia and evolved tolerance of sodium fluoroacetate. The lethal dose for mainland Western tammars was &gt;5 mg/kg, while the lethal dose for tammar on East and West Wallabi Islands and Garden Island is &lt;2 mg/kg.12 Plant species that have sodium fluoroacetate do not occur on the islands and thus tammar must have retained their tolerance since their islolation 11,500-7000 years ago.13 By contrast tammars from the eastern part of their range are highly susceptible to 1080 posion with the lethal dose for tammars on Kangaroo Island being &lt;0.2 mg/kg. 14 Between the Garden Island and Kangaroo Island populations, at two ends of the species&lt;U+2019&gt; continuum, there are also differences in serum proteins, iron-building transferrin protein and red cell antigens.15
Description
The tammar wallaby is the smallest wallaby species. It has a small head and large ears; the tail is long and thick at the base.16 It is dark, grizzled grey-brown above, becomes rufous on the sides of the body and the limbs, especially in males are pale grey-buff below.17 The tammar wallaby exhibits significant sexual dimorphism, with the maximum recorded weight in males being 9.1 kg and maximum recorded weight in females is 6.9 kg. The body length is 59 to 68 cm in males and 52 to 63 cm in females. Both males and females are about 45 cm in height. The tails of males range from 38 to 45 cm and that of females from 33 to 44 cm.18
Conservation and introduction to New Zealand
 Tammar wallaby populations on both mainland Australia and some islands have been greatly reduced or even eradicated since European occupation. The mainland population of tammars have been descripted as &quot;very plentiful in many parts of the south-west, but rapidly disappearing in the cultivated districts, especially towards the northern end of its range.&quot;19 As the region was cleared for wheat and sheep, the decline continued and tammars are only restricted to a few isolated pockets where foxes are controlled.20 In the 19th century, tammars were so common on the Eyre Peninsula and around Adelaide that battues were organized to destroy large numbers to protect crops and pastures. This has caused drastic declines and the tammar became extinct in Adelaide by the 1920s and in the Eyre Peninsula probably by the 1970s.21 However the genotype of Eyre tammars survives as they were introduced to New Zealand on Kawau Island and Rotorua. Farming activities led to the extinction of the tammar on Flinders Island and St. Peter&lt;U+2019&gt;s Island. Only on Kangaroo Island are tammars abundant and secure.22
Ecology and life history
 On Kangaroo Island, tammar wallabies shelter under divaricating bushes which cover most of the island. Tammars are nocturnal, being most active after dusk and before dawn. During this time, they forage for acacia seeds in the shrubs and feed on grassy clearing or farmland pasture.23 Tammars live in well-defined home ranges of 42 ha in summer and 16 ha in winter, and the ranges overlap with each other.24 Tammars occupy a daytime area of scrub for shelter from the sun and then move to another area of grassland at night. In summer, grass dries off and the tammars move over greater distances than in winter to higher quality food.25 Plant species in their diet include Gastrolobium bilobum, Austrodanthonia setacea, and Corymbia calophylla.26  Tammars lick their forearms and pant to maintain their body temperature against high ambient temperatures. When the ambient temperature is above 30&lt;U+00B0&gt;C, the respiratory system of the tammar increases steeply and evaporate water loss also increases. When the ambient temperature is above 40&lt;U+00B0&gt;C, it can no longer control its body temperature and will die unless it can get away from the heat.27 Tammar can avoid dehydration by passing less water in urine and by reabsorbing water from the distal colon and passing feces with water content of about 40%.28 Tammars live on several islands that have no fresh water and must subsist on water in plants or seawater.29 Tammars have been observed to go to the beach and drink seawater. They can live on seawater because they have a renal concentrating capacity far greater than other small macropods.30
Breeding
 The tammar wallaby has a promiscuous mating system with females mating with multiple males.31 Breeding is strictly seasonal and mating is highly synchronized and a large proportion of births occur in late January and early February.32 Females have a post-partum estrous cycle within hours of giving birth and all mating activity concludes within four hours of parturition when the wallabies are undisturbed.33 The testis size of male tammars have little seasonal variation.34 Concentrations of sperm and testosterone peak at the onset of the breeding season but are low the rest of the year.35 Around two weeks after females give birth, the males will begin sniffing the urogential openings and pouches of the females to evaluate their reproductive status. 36 Females allow males to mate with them from 1.3&lt;U+00B1&gt;0.8h (mean&lt;U+00B1&gt;S.D.) post-partum, although the first ejaculation is delayed until 1.8&lt;U+00B1&gt;0.8h after birth owing to intense inter-male aggression directed towards any male which attempt to mate with an estrous female.37 Mate-guarding is an important contributor to male reproductive success.38 During the estrous period a clear dominance hierarchy is established. The more dominant males spend more guarding, checking and disrupting the consortships of the estrous females.39 Mating chases, in which a post-partum female is pursued by several males, have been observed from 1.3&lt;U+00B1&gt;0.8h post-partum.40 The female tammar conceives a few hours after giving birth and suckles her young in her pouch for the next seven months. During the first five months of her lacation, the dormant embryo in her uterus will only develop if the young in her pouch is lost or removed. 41 However, after the winter solstice in June the embryo will not develop if the pouch young is removed, nor does it develop when the older young leaves the pouch in October but instead continues to remain dormant in the uterus until after the summer solstice in December.42
TSDS
In late 1998, between 120 and 230 tammar wallabies died suddenly in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms. and most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome is known as Tammar Sudden Death Syndrome (TSDS) and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney, and captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have suffered subsequent infections in summer months.43
Genome
 The genome of a marsupial is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics, because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and have not developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote. 44 The tammar wallaby is one of the model organisms as it is cheap to maintain and relatively tractable to scientific study.45 The tammar genome is comprises about 3.6 Gb, with a relatively short genetic map length of 1172 cM.46 In one study, tammar bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing key immune genes were isolated from the tammar BAC library. BACs containing T cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were physically mapped using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to tammar wallaby chromosomes.47 Congruence between the locations of these immune genes in the tammar wallaby genome, with those predicted from chromosome painting data, highlights the conservation of genomic context of these important immune genes in marsupials.48 Comparisons between human and tammar genomes have been responsible for the discovery of new human genes including RBMX and several related genes.49
Australian scientists, led by Dr. Ben Cocks, have found a compound in the milk of the Tammar Wallaby called AGG01 which has the potential to be a new and powerful form of antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein and in laboratory testing AGG01 has been shown to be 100 times more effective than penicillin, killing over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria (both gram-positive and gram&lt;U+2013&gt;negative) and fungus that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and golden staphylococcus.50
