Herm (Guern&lt;U+00E9&gt;siais: Haerme) is the smallest of the Channel Islands that is open to the public and is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey. It is one and a half miles long, and under half a mile wide; orientated North-South. Cars are banned from the island, as are bicycles; but, quad bikes and tractors used for staff and luggage transport respectively are allowed. It is located to the north-west of France, and the south of England; with Guernsey on the west and Jersey to the south-east. It is in the English Channel.
Herm was first discovered in the Mesolithic period, and the first settlers arrived in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, the majority in the north of the island. The island was annexed to the Duchy of Normandy in 933, but returned to the Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germans in the Second World War, but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears that the island's identity was at threat.
History

Ancient history to Middle Ages
Herm was first found in the Mesolithic period (between 10,000 and 8,000 B.C), when hunters were in search of food.1 In the Neolithic and Bronze ages, settlers arrived; the remains of chamber tombs have been found on the island, and may be seen today; specifically on the Common, and the Petit and Grand Monceau;2 it has been suggested that the northern end of the island, i.e. the Common, was set apart for burials.3 After a three-year project by the University of Durham, supported by specialists from the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, and the Guernsey museum, they stated that the &quot;density of tombs suggests that the northern end of Herm may have been a place set apart for funerary activity&quot;.4 
The first records of Herm's inhabitants in historic times are from the 6th century, when the island became a centre of monastic activity; the followers of Saint Tugual (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing Saint Tugual's Chapel.5 In 709, a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with Jethou.6
An important moment in Herm's political history was in 933, when the Channel Islands were annexed to the Duchy of Normandy,78 they remained so until the division of Normandy in 1204, when they became a British Crown Dependency.9` After the annexation, Herm gradually lost its monastic inhabitants, and between 1570 and 1737 the governors of Guernsey used it as a hunting ground; visiting to shoot, hunt, and fish.1011
19th century to World War II
In 1810, an inn was founded; and during the Industrial Revolution, roads, paths, a harbour, accommodation, a forge, blacksmiths, a brewery, a bakery and a prison were built to cater for the largest number of inhabitants since prehistoric times. Most were quarrymen working in new granite quarries.12 Several quarries can still be seen at present, such as on the Common.13 When the Prince14 and Princess Bl&lt;U+00FC&gt;cher15 leased the island from the British government during the First World War, he introduced a colony of Red-necked wallabies to the island,16 around 60-70 in number.17 They increased up to World War I, after which they decreased in numbers, and the remaining few were re-captured and put in enclosures.18
The German occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by the Third Reich,19; a few weeks after the arrival of German troops in Guernsey and Jersey, German soldiers landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, The Invasion of the Isle of Wight.20 Herm's sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the invasion of England, but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits.21 Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a flak battery was placed on the island, and mines were placed in an area.22
Operation Huckaback
Operation Huckaback was a British WWII military operation, which was originally designed to be a raid on Herm, Jethou and Brecqhou, but instead was only a raid on Herm alone of the channel islands on the night of 27 February 1943, following an earlier attempt which was aborted.23 Ten men of the Small Scale Raiding Force and No. 4 Commando under Captain Patrick Anthony Porteous  landed 200 yards to the north-west of Selle Rocque on a shingle beach and made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the cliff in front of them.24 Porteous finally managed to climb up the bed of a stream and pulled the others up with a rope.25 They later reported that they had found no sign of any Islanders or Germans (who were supposed to be billeted near the harbour).26
Since 1945
In 1949, the States of Guernsey bought Herm from the Crown due to the &quot;unspoilt island idyll that could be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike&quot;.27 One of the island's most influential tenants was Major Peter Wood, who looked after the island from 1949 to 1980 with his wife.2829 The island was run down when he arrived, with the manor hidden in undergrowth, the windows and roofs of the houses being blown off by a sea mine drifting into the harbour shortly after their arrival,30 but they created a school, and restored St Tugual's Chapel.31 Major Wood's daughter Pennie Wood Heyworth and her husband Adrian succeeded them;32 Major Wood died in 1998.33 Their early efforts are recorded in Herm, Our Island Home, written by Major Wood's wife Jenny Wood.34
On 17 May 2008, the BBC reported35 that the tenants had put the remaining 40 years of their lease up for sale, with an asking price of &lt;U+00A3&gt;15,000,000.36 Within four days, there were over 50 potential buyers,37 which led to fears from residents38 that the island's identity would be lost if it was bought by the wrong owner.39 In September 2008 it was announced that Starboard Settlement, a trust, had acquired the remainder of the lease40 for considerably less than the asking price.41 The trust formed a company based in Guernsey, Herm Island Ltd, to manage the island for the trustees.42
Language
A number of French/Norman placenames remain, from the period when the island was in the jurisdiction of the Duchy of Normandy.43 The Herm Island map, published by the tenant of Herm, states that main place names, including the island name itself, have unclear origins, although there is an un-official Anglicisation of names; for example, La Pointe du gentilhomme was changed to &quot;Alderney Point&quot;.44 The primary present dialect on Herm is English.
Politics
Herm is a dependency of Guernsey, and is rented out to various tenants.45 Unlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick, Herm is administered entirely by the States of Guernsey, and elects members to the States of Deliberation as part of the St. Peter Port South electoral district.46
The residents in Herm are workers on the island and their families.47
On Herm, cars and bicycles are banned from the island,48 in order to keep &quot;peace and tranquility.49 However, Herm does allow quad bikes and tractors for staff and luggage transport respectively.50
Geography and geology
 Herm is only 1&lt;U+00BD&gt;Â miles long and less than half a mile wide.51 It is oriented so that its greatest length runs north-south.52 The northern half of the coastline is surrounded by sandy beaches; the southern half is rocky.53 Much of Herm's bedrock is granite.54 In 2008, Adrian Heyworth, who was at the time the island's tenant, said that two or three meters of sand were being lost annually at Alderney Point (the northernmost point of the island).55
The isle of Jethou is around three quarters of a mile to the south.56 It is possible that in 709 AD a storm washed away the strip of land that connected Jethou to Herm.57 To the west, between Herm and Guernsey, lies the channel Little Roussel (Petit Ruau); between Herm and Sark, to the east, lies the Big Roussel (Grand Ruau).58 Br&lt;U+00E9&gt;hon Tower, a Victorian-era fortification, is in the Little Roussel between Herm and St Peter Port.59 The tower was created by Thomas Charles de Putron (1806&lt;U+2013&gt;1869) using granite from Herm between 1854 and 1856.60
 Sculptor Antony Gormley had a sculpture installed on Herm in 2010,61 originally planned to be removed after one year, but it received such a positive reception that it was kept for two years, and removed in 2012.62 The statue was number XI (11) of the Another Time series.63
Culture
Compton Mackenzie, who owned the island, represented it in Fairy Gold, albeit in a fictional representation.64
Herm has won Britain in Bloom categories several times:65 in 2002, 2008, and 2012, Herm won the Britain in Bloom Gold Award.66
Education
Herm has one primary school, with around 8 pupils; they are taught by a teacher who travels from Guernsey daily.67 Children over 9 are schooled in Guernsey, usually as boarders.68
Economy and buildings
 Tourism is Herm's main source of income.69 In a busy summer season, up to 100,000 tourists pass through Herm,70 via one of the Travel Trident catamaran ferries operated by the Trident Charter Company.71
Money is made from vegetable growing, livestock and the occasional issue of stamps.72
Buildings on the island include the White House hotel, a pub and restaurant named &quot;The Mermaid&quot; and 20 self catering cottages.73 There is an obelisk on The Common, on the North of the island.74 The White House has no clocks, televisions, or phones, which is described as &quot;part of its charm&quot;, and has a customer return rate of 70% (i.e. each year, 70$ of customers have been before).7576 Herm has no consecrated religious buildings or resident professional clergy,77 but visiting clergy conducts non-denominational weekly services during the summer months, and monthly services, led by local lay people, are held during the winter.78
Emergency services
There are three volunteer Special Constables resident on the island, trained and supervised by the States of Guernsey Police Service.79 On Bank Holidays they are augmented by a visiting full-time Constable from Guernsey.80 Crime rates on the island are low.81
There are no medical facilities on Herm and no resident doctor.82 A small team of first aiders and community first responders is maintained amongst the resident population,83 and receives regular training from the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service, a private company operating on a charitable basis under the umbrella of the Venerable Order of Saint John.84 Medical evacuation to hospital in Guernsey, where necessary, is achieved by means of the ambulance launch 'Flying Christine III' operated by the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service.85
A voluntary fire service operates on the island. Herm Fire Brigade operates a tractor-hauled fire tender with a hose-reel, a pump, a 2,000-litre water tank, and basic fire-fighting equipment86 which they use while waiting for assistance from the Guernsey Fire Brigade, who also provide the Herm volunteers with training and support.87
