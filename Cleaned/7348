The music of the video game Final Fantasy X-2 was composed by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. Regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any of the music, despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for the prequel, Final Fantasy X. The Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack was released on two Compact Discs in 2003 by Avex. After the release of Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission, an album entitled Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack composed of the songs added to the soundtrack for that game was released in 2003 by Avex. Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, a collection of piano arrangements of the original soundtracks by Noriko Matsueda, Takahito Eguchi, Hiroko Kokubu, Masahiro Sayama, and Febian Reza Pane, was released by Avex in 2004.
A single by Kumi Koda entitled real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba, based on the theme song for the game and the ending credits song, was published by Rhythm Zone prior to the game's release in 2003. Another single, titled Eternity ~Memories of Waves and Light~ Music from Final Fantasy X-2, was released by Avex in 2003 along with the original soundtrack. It consisted of live arrangements of several of the game's songs, composed and arranged by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. A set of three singles entitled Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collection- Paine, Rikku, and Yuna was published by Avex in 2003, with each single including vocal arrangements of songs from the game, sung by the respective character's voice actress.
The soundtrack received mixed reviews from critics; while several felt that the music was good and keeping in tone with the game, others found it to be odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who found a few of the songs to be enjoyable but all of the singles to be overpriced.
Concept and creation
Final Fantasy X-2 marks the first soundtrack where former Square composer Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute a single piece, despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for the prequel, Final Fantasy X, as he was already busy with other projects.1 None of the pieces from the Final Fantasy X soundtrack were re-used in X-2. Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi were brought onboard to compose the music for the game, as the developers felt they were the &quot;perfect fit&quot; to incorporate a &quot;pop&quot; style into the music.2 The game includes two songs with vocalized elements, one of which, the J-Pop song &quot;real Emotion&quot;, was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara. The other, J-Pop ballad &quot;1000 Words&quot;, was written by scenario writers Kazushige Nojima and Daisuke Watanabe. Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track. Both songs were sung by Jade Villalon from Sweetbox in the English version of the game, and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album Adagio.3 In the Japanese version of the game both the songs were sung by Koda Kumi, and were released as a single entitled real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba. Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single Come with Me, with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade. The composers also sampled a cue, &quot;Titus' Vow&quot; from Elliot Goldenthal's score for Titus for the track Zanarkand Ruins both of which can be heard at the Titus score page here. Elliot Goldenthal also composed the score for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within in 2001.4

Reception
The game's soundtrack was met with mixed feelings, because Final Fantasy X-2's score was the first in the series without input from Nobuo Uematsu,23 composer of all previous games in the main series, and because of the change to a distinct J-pop atmosphere.2425 While IGN commented that the music provided an &quot;appropriately fitting backdrop&quot;26 and 1UP.com suggested that it &quot;certainly is in keeping with the new flavor&quot;,27 others, such as Electronic Gaming Monthly, regarded it as &quot;too bubbly&quot;.28 One staff member at RPGamer suggested that &quot;the absence of Uematsu proves deafening&quot; and &quot;the soundtrack that accompanies this nonsensical adventure manages to encapsulate the shallow nature of the game perfectly&quot;.29 Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan found that the Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack album was unique and enjoyable, but &quot;ultimately forgettable.&quot;30 Liz Maas of RPGFan agreed, finding the album to be simultaneously &quot;refreshing&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;.31 Chris Heit of Soundtrack Central, however, found that the album had &quot;good, original music&quot;, although altogether different than previous Final Fantasy soundtracks.32 Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission was better received than the original soundtrack, with Patrick Gann finding several of the tracks to be &quot;beautiful&quot; and the album as a whole &quot;a sure step up from the X-2 OST&quot;. He concluded that &quot;if you owned and kept the X-2 OST, you're a fool not to add this CD to your collection.&quot;33 Chris of Square Enix Music Online had similar feelings for the album, terming it a &quot;high-quality and surprising effort&quot; and &quot;an incredible improvement&quot; over the original soundtrack.34 Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection was very well received, with Patrick Gann claiming that it &quot;shines as a light in the darkness&quot; compared to the original soundtrack and that he was &quot;extremely pleased&quot; with the album.35 Chris from Square Enix Music Online agreed, calling the album &quot;nothing short of fantastic&quot; and saying that the pianists did &quot;a flawless job executing each arrangement&quot;.36 Jillian of Square Enix Music Online agreed, finding it to be the best Final Fantasy piano arrangement album to date.37
real Emotion/1000 Words was poorly received by critics, with Patrick Gann declaring himself to be &quot;not too impressed&quot;.38 He was more receptive to Eternity ~Memories of Waves and Light~ Music from Final Fantasy X-2, feeling that the tracks were three of the best tracks from the soundtrack, and that the single was worth purchasing if only because it was the only release of arranged music from the game to date. However, he felt that for the length, the single was overpriced.39 Chris of Square Enix Music Online also felt the single was overpriced, but additionally felt that the arrangements were &quot;unremarkable musically&quot; and that the album as a whole was &quot;a cheap production.&quot;40 The Final Fantasy Vocal Collection singles received mixed reviews, with Patrick Gann praising Paine as &quot;sophisticated&quot; and applauding the instrumentation, while also approving of Yuna, terming it &quot;peaceful&quot; and the best of the three.4142 However, he also derided Rikku as &quot;cheesy&quot; and disliked the lyrics of one of the two tracks from Paine.43 Additionally, he overall found the singles to be very overpriced for the small amount of material included. Selections of music from the game have appeared on Japanese remix albums, called dojin music, and on English remixing websites.44
