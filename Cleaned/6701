USS Princess Matoika ID-2290 was a transport ship for the United States Navy during World War I. Before the war, she was a sclass Barbarossa ocean liner that sailed as SS Kiautschou for the Hamburg America Line and as SS Princess Alice sometimes spelled Prinzess Alice for North German Lloyd. After her World War I Navy service ended, she served as the United States Army transport ship USAT Princess Matoika. In post-war civilian service she was SS Princess Matoika until 1922, SS President Arthur until 1927, and SS City of Honolulu until she was scrapped in 1933.
Built in 1900 for the German Empire German Far East mail routes, SS Kiautschou traveled between Hamburg and Far East ports for most of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five cargo ship freighters, and renamed SS Princess Alice. She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of Cebu City Cebu in the Philippines. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS Princess Matoika carried over 50,000U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war. In July 1920, she was a last-minute substitute to carry a large portion of the United States team to the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. From the perspective of the Olympic team, the trip was disastrous and a majority of the team members published a list of grievances and demands of the United States Olympic Committee American Olympic Committee in an action known today as the Mutiny of the Matoika Mutiny of the Matoika.
After her Army career ended, Princess Matoika was transferred to the United States Mail Steamship Line for European passenger service in early 1921. After that company's financial troubles resulted in her seizure, Princess Matoika was assigned to the newly formed United States Lines and resumed passenger service. In 1922, the ship was renamed SS President Arthur, in honor of the 21st List of Presidents of the United States U.S. President, Chester A. Arthur. When changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s, the ship was laid up in Baltimore in late 1923.
President Arthur was purchased in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned American Palestine Line to begin regular service between New York, Naples, and Palestine. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly became the first ocean liner to fly the Flag of Israel Zionist flag at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the Los Angeles Steamship Company for Los AngelesHonolulu service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in Honolulu Harbor in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.
 Hamburg America Line 
In March 1900 the HAPAG first=long announced the plans for 22 new ships totaling GRT 150,000 first=yes at a cost of $11,000,000. One of the two largest ships announced was SS Kiautschou at an announced GRT 10,200.cite news   url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9C02E0DE1E3CE433A25756C2A9659C946197D6CF   format = pdf   title = Hamburg-American fleet   work = The New York Times   date = 25 March 1900   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 14  The ship was Keel laying laid down at AG Vulcan Stettin in Stettin, Germany present-day Szczecin, Poland. During her construction, HAPAG renamed the ship twice before finally settling on Kiautschou, the German colony in China, as her namesake.Bonsor Vol. 1, p. 408 identifies the two names as Borussia and Teutonia, while Drechsel Vol. 1, p. 338 gives them as Bavaria and Teutonia. Built, along with sister ship SS Hamburg  2, for HAPAG's entry into the Reichspost#Deutsche Reichspost Deutsche Reichspost's Far East routes, Kiautschou was launched on 14&nbsp;September 1900, and sailed on her maiden voyage from Hamburg to the Far East on 22&nbsp;December 1900.Bonsor, Vol. 1, p. 408.
The ship was convert 525 ft m long and featured twin screws powered by two quadruple expansion steam engines that generated convert 9000 hp. The liner also featured bilge keels that helped stabilize her ride. On the interior, Kiautschou's first-class state rooms were described as light and large and located in the center of the ship. She had two large promenade decks, a music room, and a library. Her smoking room was at the rear of the upper promenade deck, and her large dining room featured a balcony where the ship's orchestra could serenade diners.cite news    format = pdf   title = Luncheon on a liner   work = The New York Times   date = 6 April 1904   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 16 
Kiautschou sailed on the HamburgFar East route until May 1902. For one round trip that month, Kiautschou replaced fellow HAPAG steamer SS Deutschland 1900 2 on HamburgNew York service,cite news   title = Hamburg America...   format =  display ad   work = The New York Times   date = 11 May 1902   page = 25  calling at Southampton and Cherbourg on her eastbound trip,cite news   title = Shipping and Foreign Mails   work = The New York Times   date = 4 May 1902   page = 23  and at Cherbourg and Plymouth on her westbound return.cite news   title = Shipping and Foreign Mails   work = The New York Times   date = 24 May 1902   page = 13  After this one transatlantic excursion, Kiautschou was returned to HamburgFar East service. On 20 February 1904, in exchange for abandoning the mail routes shared with North German Lloyd, HAPAG traded Kiautschou for Lloyd cargo ship freighters Bamberg, Knigsberg, Nrnberg, Stolberg, and Strassburg.
 North German Lloyd 
North German Lloyd renamed the newly acquired ship Princess Alice, though the German spelling Prinzess Alice was widely used in contemporary press coverage and, often, by the Lloyd themselves. There is some confusion as to who exactly was the namesake of the ship. Edwin Drechsel, in his two-volume work Norddeutscher Lloyd, Bremen, 18571970, reports that the ship was named equally for Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone Princess Alice of Albany and Alice Roosevelt Longworth Alice Roosevelt. Princess Alice of Albany was a granddaughter of Victoria of the United Kingdom Queen Victoria, and the new bride of Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone Prince Alexander of Teck in Wrttemberg.Eilers, p. 215. Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the then-current U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, was nicknamed Princess Alice by the press, and had ship naming and launching launched the racing yacht of William II, German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II, Meteor, at Staten Island two years before.Drechsel, Vol. 1, p. 261. Alice Roosevelt had been further honored by the German Empire by the March 1902 renaming of former torpedo boat D2 to Alice Roosevelt. William Lowell Putnam gives the namesake as Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the daughter of Queen Victoria.Putnam, p. 145. Putnam states further that Princess Alice of the United Kingdom Princess Alice was the wife of Frederick III, German Emperor Kaiser Freidrich III, apparently confusing Alice with her sister Victoria, Princess Royal Princess Victoria, who was, in fact, the wife of Kaiser Freidrich III.

Princess Alice departed her new homeport of Bremen on 22&nbsp;March 1904 for her maiden voyage under her new owners. After arriving in New York draped in flags and bunting, her dining room was the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city. Princess Alice made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to BremenSuez CanalFar East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31&nbsp;August. Princess Alice would continue this patternsailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the yearthrough 1910.
Throughout the rest of her Lloyd North Atlantic career she carried some notable passengers to and from Europe. In May 1905, for example, noted Baltimore gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly, one of the co-founders of Johns Hopkins Hospital, sailed from New York;cite journal   title = Town & Country Calender: Arrivals and Departures   journal = Town & Country magazine Town & Country   date = 27 May 1905   volume = 3080   pages = 6   location = New York   publisher = Stuyvesant   issn = 0040-9952   oclc =5878257  author Hamilton Wright Mabie and his wife sailed from New York the following month.cite journal   title = Town & Country Calender: Arrivals and Departures   journal = Town & Country   date = 8 July 1905   volume = 3086   pages = 3   location = New York   publisher = Stuyvesant    issn = 0040-9952   oclc =5878257  American botanist Charles Frederick Millspaugh returned to New York aboard the German liner in June 1906,cite news   title = Ocean travelers   work = The New York Times   date = 20 June 1906   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 14  and retired U.S. Navy Rear admiral United States Rear admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan did the same in June 1907.cite news   title = Rear Admiral Mahan returns  work=The Washington Post   date = 21 June 1907   page = 3  Senator Augustus Octavius Bacon Augustus O.

Prompted by the successful use of radio wireless in saving lives during the sinking of RMS Republic 1903 6 in January 1909, and by proposed U.S. legislation later passed as the Wireless Ship Act of 1910 requiring wireless for ships calling at U.S. ports, Princess Alice received her first wireless set in February 1909.cite news   url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9803E6DC153EE733A25751C1A9649C946897D6CF   format = pdf   title = Wireless on more ships   work = The New York Times   date = 12 February 1909   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 1 Pierce, p. 690.

At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, loaded with over 1,000&nbsp;passengers headed for Europe, Princess Alice departed the Lloyd pier in Hoboken, New Jersey Hoboken, New Jersey. As she neared The Narrows in a heavy fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound Compagnie Gnrale Transatlantique French Line steamer SS La Bretagne  2 and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the seawall of Fort Wadsworth a few minutes after 11:00.cite news   url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D04EEDD1E31E733A2575BC2A9639C946897D6CF   format = pdf   title = The Prinzess Alice aground in the bay   work = The New York Times   date = 28 May 1909   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 1 cite news   url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9902E5D6153EE733A2575AC2A9639C946897D6CF   format = pdf   title = Prinzess Alice sails   work = The New York Times   date = 29 May 1909   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 2  After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of Princess Alice had stopped some convert 5 ft m 1 from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. Lighthouse tender Larkspur was the first ship to come to the aid of the Princess, followed by United States Army U.S. Army United States Army Quartermaster Corps Quartermaster's ship General Meigs and Cutter ship revenue cutter USRC Seneca Seneca. No passengers were hurt in the incident and it was determined there was no damage to the hull of the liner. But, despite the effort of attending ships, she would remained stuck on the ledge. Eventually, after offloading convert 500 ST t of cargo from her front Hold ship hold onto lighter barge lighters called to the scene, ten steam tugs and power from Princess Alice's own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28&nbsp;May, almost 15&nbsp;hours after running aground. Unfortunately, the force required to free the liner was great enough that she was then propelled into SS&nbsp;Marken, at anchor some distance away, damaging one of that ship's Fender boating fenders. After then making her way to the nearby New York City Quarantine Station, Princess Alice anchored to reload her cargo, and by 09:05, the was underway again. However, completing her comedy of errors, she ran aground again in soft mud in Ambrose Channel at 10:15. This time she was able to free herself and proceeded on to Bremen, a little more than 24&nbsp;hours late. This voyage was further marred by the apparent suicide of a despondent New York attorney on 30 May. The man, headed to the spa town of Bad Nauheim in Hesse, had previously suffered a nervous breakdown and was under the care of a doctor on board the ship at the time he jumped overboard.cite news    format = pdf   title = Moss jumped from steamer   work = The New York Times   date = 5 June 1909   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = 1 
File:SS Princess Alice interned at Cebu, Philippines.jpg thumb left SS Princess Alice is pictured during her internment at Cebu City Cebu, Philippines, c. 19141916.
In May 1910, Princess Alice sailed her last North Atlantic passage for her German owners. Put permanently on the Far East route, she plied Pacific waters for North German Lloyd until the outbreak of World War I. In late July 1914, as war spread across Europe, Princess Alice neared her destination of Hong Kong with 850,000 of gold from India. Rather than face seizure of the ship and her cargo by British authorities there, Princess Alice instead sped to the Philippines and deposited the gold with the German Consul at Manila. Leaving the neutral port in under 24&nbsp;hours, the ship then rendezvoused with German cruiser SMS Emden 1906 2 at Angaur before returning to the Philippines in early August and putting in at Cebu City Cebu where she was interned.
 USS Princess Matoika 
On 6 April 1917 the United States declared war and immediately seized interned German ships at U.S. and territorial ports, but unlike most other German ships interned by the United States, Princess Alice had not been sabotaged by her German crew before her seizure. Assigned the Identification Number of 2290, she was soon renamed Princess Matoika. Sources disagree about the identity of the ship's namesake, who is often reported as either a member of the Philippine Royal Family,cite news   url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9F06EED8103FE432A25753C3A9679C946095D6CF   format = pdf   title = Transport in new career   work = The New York Times   date = 30 January 1921   accessdate =11 April 2008   page = E3  or a Japanese princess.Cutchins and Stewart, p. 64. Cutchins and Stewart are quoting Ernest R. Kinkle and John J. Pullam, historians of the 113th Infantry Regiment. Putnam, however, provides another answer: one of the given names of Pocahontas was Matoaka, which was sometimes spelled Matoika.Putnam, p. 145, note 32. Given that two other ex-German liners were renamed USS Pocahontas ID-3044 and USS Powhatan ID-3013after Pocahontas and Powhatan her fatherthis seems the most likely. The newly renamed ship was taken to Olongapo City, convert 60 mi km north of Manila and placed in the drydock Drydock Dewey YFD-1 Dewey at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay Subic Bay where temporary repairs were made. She then made her way to San Francisco, and eventually to the East Coast of the United States east coast. Princess Matoika was the last ex-German ship to be commissioned.Crowell and Wilson, p. 417.
 Transporting troops to France 
Placed under the command of William D. Leahy in April 1918, the ship was readied for her first transatlantic troop run.cite web   url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-2.htm   title = Fleet Admiral William Daniel Leahy    author = Naval Historical Center   publisher = United States Department of the Navy   date = 7 August 1996   accessdate =10 April 2008 At Newport News, Virginia Newport News, Virginia, elements of the 4th Infantry Division United States 4th Infantry Division boarded on 9&nbsp;May.Pollard, p. 26.

The group rendezvoused with a similar group that left New York the same day, consisting of USS President Lincoln 1907 2, USS Covington ID-1409 2, USS Rijndam ID-2505 2, British troopship SS Dwinsk  2, and Italian steamers SS Caserta  2 and SS Dante Alighieri  2.Crowell and Wilson, p. 609.Gleaves, p. 202. American cruiser USS Frederick CA-8 2 served as escort for the assembled ships, which were the 35th U.S. convoy of the war.Crowell and Wilson, p. 609. During the voyagebecause of the inability to finish serving three meals for all the men during daylight hoursmess service was curtailed to two daily meals, a practice continued on later voyages.Cutchins and Stewart, p. 65. On 20 May, the convoy sighted and fired on a submarine that turned out to be a bucket; the next day escort Frederick left the convoy after being relieved by nine destroyers. Three days later the convoy sighted land at 06:30 and anchored at Brest, France Brest that afternoon.Pollard, p. 27. Princess Matoika sailed for Newport News and arrived there safely on 6&nbsp;June with Pastores and Lenape. Fate, however, was not as kind to former convoy mates President Lincoln and Dwinsk.

In the next months, Princess Matoika successfully completed two additional roundtrips from Newport News. On the first trip, she left Newport News with DeKalb, Dante Alighiere, Wilhelmina, Pastores, and British troopship HMT Czaritza  2 on 18&nbsp;July.Crowell and Wilson, p. 613.

This solution of how to use the Princess for civilian service was the culmination of efforts by the USSB to find a suitable civilian use for her. In 1919, she was one of the ships suggested for a proposed service from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Valparaiso, Chile,McIntosh, p. 20. and in November 1919, tentative plans were announced for her service with the Munson Line between New York and Argentina beginning in mid-1920,cite news   title = Two ships for Argentina   work = The Washington Post   date = 8 November 1919   page = 6  but both of these proposals fell through.

At the conclusion of her reconstruction in May, City of Honolulu sailed on a 24-hour shakedown cruise.
 Maiden voyage 
City of Honolulu was rebuilt to GRT 10,680 and had accommodations for around 450&nbsp;first-class and 50&nbsp;third-class passengers. Her hull was painted all white for LASSCO service, and she sported period designs in her common areas. The dining room, large enough to seat 300 in a single sitting, was decorated in a Greek Revival architecture Grecian theme, and featured 18&nbsp;stained glass windows designed by San Diego architect Carleton Winslow.cite news   title = Ocean palace to sail today   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 4 June 1927   page = A1  The smoking room was done up in a Tudor style architecture Tudor style; the music room was decorated in a combined Second Empire architecture French and Italianate architecture Italian Renaissance manner; and the writing room was in Adam style. The suite hotel suites were all done in either Adam, Queen Anne Style architecture Queen Anne, or Louis XVI style Louis XVI styles. The ship featured six passenger elevators, and a swimming pool patterned on a Pompeian design. One of the few remaining traces of her pre-war German decoration was the rosewood railing on her grand staircase.
On 4 June 1927, a crowd of 7,000 well-wishers saw City of Honolulu depart on her maiden voyage. The festivities were also broadcast on radio station KGFO,cite news   title = Palatial liner off on voyage   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 5 June 1927   page = B5  a portable station operating form the front cargo deck of the ship.

 Career 
After completion of her maiden voyage, City of Honolulu began regular service from Los Angeles to Honolulu and Hilo, Hawaii Hilo on what LASSCO called the Great Circle Route of Sunshine. After arriving at Honolulu, the ship would sail southeast to Hilo, passing the islands of Molokai and Maui on their north sides. On the return from Hilo, the liner would traverse the Alalkeiki Channel Alalkeiki, the Auau Channel Auau, and the Kalohi Channels, taking the ship between Maui and Molokai on the north and the islands of Kahoolawe and Lanai on the south.cite web   url = http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/images/lasscoi.htm   title = Hawaii direct from Los Angeles   format = brochure and timetable   month = February   year = 1927   publisher = Los Angeles Steamship Company   accessdate =1 May 2008 Convenience copy located at http://www.timetableimages.com/maritime/index.htm Maritime Timetable Images.
Throughout her career, City of Honolulu transported many notable passengers to Hawaii. In July 1927, for example, Henry Smith Pritchett, president of the The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Carnegie Foundation, sailed to Hawaii en route to a meeting with the Institute of Pacific Relations.cite news   title = Shipping and Los Angeles Harbor news   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 2 July 1927   page = 15   In June 1928, movie stars Norma Talmadge, Gilbert Roland, and Lottie Pickford began a Hawaiian vacation,cite news   title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 2 June 1928   page = 7  and on 28&nbsp;July, Jane Addams, the founder of Hull House and a pioneer of the settlement movement, headed there as well. Addams was on her way to attend the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference and the congress of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom; a former List of Governors of Hawaii Governor of Hawaii, Walter F. Frear, returned to the islands on that same voyage.cite news   title = Busy week-end due at harbor    work = Los Angeles Times   date = 28 July 1928   page = 15  In December, Al Jolson and his wife, Ruby Keeler, sailed on the liner for a vacation,cite news   title = Bookings heavy for Hawaii trip   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 15 December 1928   page = A16  and early the next February, the reigning The Open Championship British Open golf champion, Walter Hagen, sailed to start a four-month golfing tour and exhibition in Australia.

City of Honolulu also carried notable visitors to the Continental United States mainland. Farris M. Brown, a dealer in Stradivarius Stradivarius instruments, arrived in Los Angeles in May 1928 with three of the famous maker's violins, including the Baron Knoop Stradivarius.cite news   title = Glorified peddler debarks   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 26 May 1928   page = A6  In April 1929, Sweden Swedish swimmer Arne Borg, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour,cite news   title = Borg visitor in Southland    work = Los Angeles Times   date = 27 April 1929   page =10   and in May, Sir James Gunnson, a former Mayor of Auckland, arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between California and New Zealand.cite news   title = Original booster for city arrives   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 25 May 1929   page = A1  The next January, Herbert James Hagerman Herbert Hagerman, former List of Governors of New Mexico Territory Governor of New Mexico Territory; author Basil Woon, who had been doing research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter and chewing gum magnate William Edward Easterwood William Easterwood all sailed stateside on the ship.cite news   last = Cave   first = Wayne B   title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 4 January 1930   page = 7 
Apart from notable passengers carried during her tenure, City of Honolulu also frequently served as a conveyance for newlyweds heading for Hawaiian honeymoons.See, for example, Sundays on new honeymoon, Los Angeles Times, 7 May 1928, p. A11; and Honeymooners 'in the same boat', Los Angeles Times, 27 August 1928, p. A1. She also carried, in addition to passengers, cargo in both directions, transporting commodities, such as fertilizer and oil, to Hawaii,cite news   title = Local liner in flames   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 26 May 1930   page = 1  and Hawaiian goods, like sugar and fresh and canned pineapple to the mainland.See, for example, Excursionists land today, Los Angeles Times, 18 August 1928, p. A9.
 Fire and scrapping 
City of Honolulu's career as a tropical liner, however, was short-lived. On the afternoon of 25 May 1930, just shy of completing three years of LASSCO service, a fire broke out on her B deck while she was docked in her namesake city. Although aided by fireboat Leleiona and U.S. Navy submarine rescue ship USS Widgeon ASR-1 2, firefighters were unable to bring the blaze under control quickly, and it spread to convert 100 ST t of potash aboard the liner. Fears that her cargo of convert 16000 oilbbl of oil would explode caused firefighters to intentionally sink the liner at her pier in order to help extinguish the conflagration. Through firefighters' efforts, the fire was contained to the upper three decks, leaving the ship's power plant relatively undamaged.cite news   last = Drake   first = Waldo   title = Lassco's liner due in dry dock   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 11 June 1930   page = 11  All crew members and LASSCO employees on board the ship got off safely; no passengers were on the ship at the time of the fire.cite news   author = Associated Press   title = Burned liner's crew all safe   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 27 May 1930   page = 4 
The ship was pumped out and raised on 9 June, and taken to the naval drydock at Pearl Harbor for inspection on 12 June. While remaining in Hawaii, one engine was restored to working order and the ship departed for Los Angeles under her own power on 30&nbsp;October. After her arrival, further inspections were conducted, and it was determined that repairs would be too expensive, especially given the Great Depression global economic conditions. City of Honolulu was declared a total loss, and was laid up in the West Basin of Los Angeles Harbor for almost three years.cite news   last = Cave   first = Wayne B   title = Shipping news and activities at Los Angeles Harbor   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 20 December 1932   page = 13  During her lay up, fittings and fixtures stripped from the vessel were auctioned in July 1932,cite news   title = Steamship salvage auction...   format = display advertisement   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 31 July 1932   page = 11  and in December, film crews from Columbia Pictures Columbia Pictures Corporation spent ten days filming on board the ship.
City of Honolulu was sold to Japanese ship breaking shipbreakers in mid 1933,cite news   last = Drake   first = Waldo   title = Two old liners to be scrapped   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 2 August 1933   page = 6  andin the company of SS Calawaii  2, another LASSCO ship destined for the scrap heapthe City of Honolulu departed Los Angeles in late August under her own power. Manned by a Philippines Filipino crew, the 33-year-old liner developed a problem with one of her boilers almost immediately and had to put in to San Francisco for repairs. Getting underway after a lengthy delay, one of her engines failed in mid-ocean, leaving her to plod on to Japan on one engine.cite news   last = Drake   first = Waldo   title = Hopes for deep fairway rise   work = Los Angeles Times   date = 29 September 1933   page = 17  She eventually arrived in Osaka at the shipbreaker in mid-December, and was scrapped shortly thereafter.
