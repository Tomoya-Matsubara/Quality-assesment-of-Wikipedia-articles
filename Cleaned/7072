The Gulfstream American GA-7 Cougar is an United States American Aluminium all-metal, 4-seat, twin-engined light aircraft. 
The Cougar was a twin-engine development of the Grumman American AA-5 Gulfstream American AA-5B Tiger and traces its lineage to the Grumman American AA-1 AA-1 Yankee Clipper and the Bede BD-1.
 Development 
Following Gulfstream Aerospace Gulfstream Aerospaces purchase of Grumman Grummans American light aircraft division in 1977, the company embarked on a policy of aircraft model development. During this time the other aircraft in the line, including the Grumman American AA-1 AA-1B Trainer and the Grumman American AA-5 AA-5B Tiger underwent extensive redesign. 
The aircraft line Gulfstream then fielded included the redesigned Grumman American AA-1 AA-1C Lynx two seater, the Grumman American AA-5 Gulfstream American AA-5A Cheetah and the Grumman American AA-5 Gulfstream American AA-5B Tiger single engine aircraft. The next obvious step was to develop the existing twin-engined version of the AA-5, which Grumman American had first flown as a prototype on 20 December 1974. Gulfstream did extensive redesign work on the former Grumman project and the Gulfstream production prototype did not fly until 14 January 1977.
The Cougar uses the same honeycomb and bonded metal construction that is the hallmark of the line since the BD-1. The prototype's single spar wing was upgraded to a double-spar configuration and this allowed a wet wing. The resulting aircraft was designated the GA-7 for Gulfstream American and was given the name Cougar in keeping with the existing Lynx, Cheetah and Tiger names for aircraft in the company's line. 
The Cougar was intended for the flying school twin-engined trainer market and also as a personal use aircraft. The Cougar is powered by a pair of wing-mounted Lycoming O-320 Lycoming O-320-D1D engines of convert 160 hp kW 0 abbr=on. It carries four people at maximum cruise speed of convert 160 kn km/h 0 abbr=on and a typical cruise speed of convert 140 kn km/h 0 abbr=on. It was certified under US Federal Aviation Regulations#Regulations of Interest#Part 23 FAR Part 23 on 22 September 1977.cite web url = http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgMakeModel.nsf/0/B2CEC2BAFD278D88862572A00056C584?OpenDocument&Highlight=ga-7 title = TYPE CERTIFICATE DATA SHEET NO. A17SO accessdate = 2008-07-02 last = Federal Aviation Administration authorlink =  year = 2007 month = March
Production of the Cougar ran for only two model years, 1978 and 1979 before production was halted. Just 115 Cougars were delivered.
In 1995 the type certificate for the GA-7 was sold to SOCATA of France who intended to develop the aircraft and produce it as the TB 320 Tangara. The Tangara was to be powered by two Lycoming O-360 Lycoming O-360-A1G6 engines of convert 180 hp kW 0 abbr=on each. The first Tangara was a modified Cougar, had convert 160 hp kW 0 abbr=on engines and first flew in mid-1996. The complete Tangara prototype was also a converted Cougar and had the convert 180 hp kW 0 abbr=on engines. It first flew in February 1997. Despite SOCATA's plans to put the Tangara into production this never occurred.
