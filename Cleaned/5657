&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; is a song recorded by the American singer Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; Knowles for her fourth studio album, 4 (2011). It was released by Columbia Records on June 1, 2011, as the second single from the album. &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was composed by Patrick &quot;J. Que&quot; Smith, Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Caleb McCambpell, Antonio Dixon, Knowles, and Shea Taylor. Recorded and produced at MSR Studio and KMA Studio in New York City, the song was originally not written as a ballad, but was inspired by the drumming on Doug E. Fresh's 1985 single &quot;The Show&quot;. Knowles said that anyone, regardless of gender, should be able to relate to the song.
A pop-R&amp;B song, the subjects of &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; are revenge and karma. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize the potential for a happy life with her. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics, who viewed it as a sequel to Knowles' 2006 single &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;the two songs are thematically similar. They praised Knowles' vocal delivery as well as the openness of the song's message; &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was deemed to have strong radio appeal. However, some lyrics, including &quot;showed your ass&quot; and &quot;Sucks to be you right now&quot;, were criticized. The ballad was also likened to Vanessa Carlton's 2002 single &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; (2002).
&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; peaked at number 16 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and at number four on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. It rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the Irish Singles Chart among others. The song reached number one on the South Korea Gaon International Chart, the UK R&amp;B Chart, and the US Hot Dance Club Play chart, and the top 30 in mainland Europe, Oceania, and Canada. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).
The accompanying music video for &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was directed by Diane Martel. It shows Knowles getting ready for her wedding while she recalls her ex-lover, who never gave her the attention she deserved. Critics generally wrote that Knowles looked stunning in the bridal suite, and commended her ability to sing directly to the camera when telling the subject of the song that she was the best lover he ever had. &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was promoted with several live performances by Knowles, notably at the 2011 Glastonbury Festival and on the televised show The View. The song was also included on the set list for her concert 4 Intimate Nights with Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; and other shows.
Writing and recording
Knowles and Patrick &quot;J. Que&quot; Smith wrote &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; in collaboration with its producers Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, Symbolyc One, Antonio Dixon, Shea Taylor, and Caleb McCampbell.1234 According to Smith, &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; is a ballad but was not originally written so; early demos sounded like late 1980s hip hop material.5 The main inspiration for the song was the drumming of Doug E. Fresh's song &quot;The Show&quot; (1985).67 Smith told Gyant of Black Entertainment Television (BET) that he was initially intimidated at the prospect of working with Knowles. He was in Los Angeles when Tony Dixon telephoned him to say he and Edmonds were going to write some songs with Knowles.8 Smith was asked to join them in the studio and the trio wrote part of &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot;. After a few days, Dixon and Smith went to the studio again and completed the writing. The song was modified by Edmonds after hearing a demo; he tweaked the lyrics and added a few more melodies.9
Knowles' vocals were recorded at the KMA Studio in New York City.1011 When the trio played Knowles the demo of &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot;, she immediately approved it after making slight modifications.12 Smith says that Knowles was literally jumping up and down after hearing the demo.13 One hour later Knowles recorded &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; and two other songs.14 Smith recalled that Knowles focused solely on the recording, ignoring hunger as she worked into the night.15 Knowles has stated that every man and woman can relate to the song's subject matter because at one point, almost everyone ends a relationship because of lack of commitment by his or her partner.1617
Artwork and release
A private listening party for Knowles' fourth studio album, 4, was held on May 12, 2011.18 Knowles offered a select group of fans a preview of five songs from 4, including &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot;.19 On May 20, 2011, a song called &quot;End of Time&quot;, featuring Knowles professing everlasting love,20 was leaked online, watermarked with the tag &quot;internal use only&quot;.21 Several websites, including MTV News reported that it might be released as the second single from 4.22 However, these speculations were soon overshadowed by the release of &quot;1+1&quot; on May 25, 2011, a promotional single in the United States exclusively.23 Nevertheless, Columbia Records reported that &quot;1+1&quot; would not be released for airplay and that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was favored as the second single from 4, following &quot;Run the World (Girls)&quot;.24
On May 27, 2011, Pittsburgh radio station 96.1 Kiss FM received an email from Knowles' management, informing them that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; would premiere on radio on June 1, 2011. The single debuted on US radio at 8 a.m. (EST) that day.25 Its cover artwork was also unveiled on June 1, 2011, on Knowles' official website.26 It was photographed by Ellen von Unwerth27 and shows Knowles posing in a bathroom in front of a mirror while wearing a tight-fitting dress designed by Lleah Rae.2829 She holds a tube of red lipstick, which has been used to write &quot;King B&quot; on the mirror.30 The song was digitally released in Australia,31 Canada,32 New Zealand,33 and the US on June 1, 2011,34 and in Europe on June 9, 2011.3536 &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was released as a digital download in the UK on July 3, 2011,37 and as a CD single in Germany on July 29, 2011, and in the UK on August 2, 2011.3839 A Digital EP containing four remixes of the song was released in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the UK on September 2, 2011.40414243
Composition and lyrical interpretation
&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; is a midtempo pop and R&amp;B power ballad, which incorporates elements of gospel.444546 The song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute, and is written in the key of G major. The introduction follows the chord progression of G&lt;U+2013&gt;C&lt;U+2013&gt;Em&lt;U+2013&gt;D, while the verses follow Em&lt;U+2013&gt;Gsus4&lt;U+2013&gt;G&lt;U+2013&gt;Em&lt;U+2013&gt;D6&lt;U+2013&gt;Gsus4&lt;U+2013&gt;G.47 Layered female vocals provide a backing to Knowles' occasionally aggressive vocals.4849 The instrumentation includes a piano, stadium-sized bass drums,5051 and strings.52 &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; is thematically a kiss-off song; it is in this respect similar to Knowles' own songs &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; (2006) and &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot; (2008).535455
Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that elements of the ballad have emanated from Celine Dion's &quot;That&lt;U+2019&gt;s The Way It Is&quot; (1999), and Bruce Hornsby's &quot;The Way It Is&quot; (1986).56 Caryn Ganz of Yahoo! Music wrote that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; resembles Vanessa Carlton's 2002 song &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot; paired with Ryan Tedder's thumping beat.57 Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media also noted that the song wouldn't sound &quot;out-of-place&quot; on a Vanessa Carlton album.58 Priya Elan of NME noted that the ballad is reminiscent of Knowles' own 2008 songs &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Scared Of Lonely&quot;, owing to its cascading piano work and drum beat.59 James Dinh of MTV News wrote that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; sounds like a song from a Broadway musical; he attributed the comparison to Knowles' collaboration with the band from Fela! to gain inspiration from the play's subject, Nigerian musician and composer Fela Kuti.60
The song's lyrics are about the breakdown of a relationship between Knowles and her lover, a situation that suits both of them.61 They also touch on revenge and karma, particularly the opening line, &quot;What goes around comes back around&quot;, the lines &quot;Best thing I've ever had&quot;, &quot;Best thing you've never had&quot;, and the closing line, &quot;Sucks to be you right now&quot;.6263 Happy to have avoided heartbreak,6465 Knowles continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize the possibility of a happy relationship with Knowles until the relationship broke down.66 Knowles no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit;67 as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, &quot;When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I&lt;U+2019&gt;m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I&lt;U+2019&gt;m so through with that / Because honestly / You turned out to be the best thing I never had / And will always be the best thing you never had.&quot;6869
In the second verse, Knowles continues to dismiss her former lover as she sings, &quot;So sad, you're hurt / boo hoo ...&quot;, over a tinkling piano riff and bass drums.70 She then chants the ascendant chorus,71 which this time features soaring strings and an uplifting aggressive piano accompaniment.727374 Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio noted that though Knowles rips through the verses, she sings the chorus and bridge with restraint;75 on the latter, she affirms that she has moved on in life.76 The song ends as Knowles repeatedly sings, &quot;What goes around comes back around / I bet it sucks to be you right now&quot;.77
Critical reception
&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was generally well received by music critics who complimented Knowles' vocals, the honesty in the song's message, and its radio appeal. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; and Knowles' previous singles including &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; and &quot;If I Were a Boy&quot;, and concluded that Knowles &quot;certainly knows how to dump a man in style&quot;.78 Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; could be &quot;Irreplaceable Part Two&quot; and noted that Knowles' vocal performance brings depth to the song.79 Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, but &quot;nor is it as shady&quot;. He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics.80 Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Knowles' vocal performance &quot;as [a] wounded bird turned resilient lioness&quot;.81 Choosing &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as &quot;a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s ability to plow through it&quot;.82 Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of &quot;Run the World (Girls)&quot;, and wrote:
&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; finds Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; mining the same kind of girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels like the kind of crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;'s discography in multiplatinum land.83
Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press noted that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; is different from &quot;Run the World (Girls)&quot; and that it shows a side of Knowles that listeners rarely see.84 Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that the song reveals &quot;a more ferocious side to Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; with it's [sic] faster pace and aggressive piano backing&quot;.85 Robert Copsey of Digital Spy commented that the &quot;['Best Thing I Never Had'] is a classic Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt; track waiting to happen&quot;.86 Chad Grischow of IGN wrote that &quot;the lush backing music and [the] soaring vocals&quot; on the song sound suitable for an updated take on the Waiting To Exhale soundtrack album as Knowles is ecstatic that she ended a poor relationship before it was too late.87 Jon Caramainca of The New York Times commented that the &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; has &quot;optimistic, coffee-commercial&quot; pianos, which place Knowles directly in Lilith Fair territory.88 James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that it is one of the best ballads on the album 4.89 James Dinh of the same publication added that the song has a radio-friendly appeal and a catchy chorus.90 Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly and Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle praised the song's radio nature,9192 with the latter calling it &quot;a return to form&quot; with a &quot;regal sound of a radio smash&quot;.93 Jim Farber of Daily News wrote that the melodies and the clever lyrics of &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; are likely to inspire significant airplay.94 Ricky Schweitzer of One Thirty BPM commented that even though the ballad sounds like a place-filler on 4, it remains largely superior &quot;to the majority of the trash being churned out by Beyonc&lt;U+00E9&gt;&lt;U+2019&gt;s peers&quot;.95
&quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; also received a few mixed and negative reviews. Amos Barshad of New York magazine wrote that the ballad borrows more heavily from Knowles' own 2006 single &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;, and that &quot;[this] can't be a bad thing&quot;. However, he noted that &quot;this time in language ('Sucks to be you right now') agreeable to a nation of tweens and in a manner agreeable to anyone who likes yelping along in unison to ascendant pop choruses.&quot;96 David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that lines like &quot;showed your ass&quot; and &quot;it must suck to be you&quot; exemplify lame lyrics. He concluded that, &quot;[listeners] are wondering how such lame lyrics could be sung with such earnestness.&quot;97 Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that the most interesting thing about &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; is the curious image evoked by the chorus' lyric, noting that everything seemed fine until &quot;the protagonist's former amorata 'showed your ass'&quot;.98 Music Week{{'}}s Ben Cardew commented that its 1980s sound is &quot;not a highlight&quot;.99 A negative review came from Al Shipley of The Village Voice who wrote that &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; and &quot;Party&quot; were &quot;among the album's worst and most unrepresentative songs&quot;.100

Music video
Background and concept
The music video for &quot;Best Thing I Never Had&quot; was directed by Diane Martel, and filmed in Westchester County on June 15, 2011 and in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, on June 16, 2011.145 On June 20, 2011, it was reported that Knowles would not play the prom queen in the video. Knowles said that not being prom queen in the video reminded her of how she never wore the coveted tiara at her own high school dance.146 She added that she felt strange because her father, Mathew Knowles, did not escort her down the aisle in the wedding scene, as he had when she married Jay-Z in April 2008.147 The wedding scene was filmed in a country club in Sleepy Hollow on June 15, 2011.148 In July 2011, Knowles was interviewed by Access Hollywood, where she said of the video's set:
It was a little strange. And definitely when I walked down the aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy &lt;U+2014&gt; there&lt;U+2019&gt;s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it&lt;U+2019&gt;s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.149
Knowles said that the wedding dress she wears in the video was a Barachi one, which she saw in a shop window a year ago when she was at the 52nd Grammy Awards. She added that the dress was &quot;just like a beautiful fantasy, so we called and they still had the dress&quot;.150 Knowles also wears a tiara designed by Lorraine Schwartz, who converted it from a necklace.151 Knowles said that the wedding outfit made her feel &quot;like royalty ...  like a queen&quot;.152 She added that the music video wedding was more chaotic than her real wedding in 2008, &quot;This may have been a little more crazy, actually. I had to sing at the same time!&quot;153 The ivory draped V-neck gown which Knowles wears in the video was designed by the Chinese-American fashion designer Vera Wang.154 The video premiered online at 8 pm (EST) on July 7, 2011.155156 It was available for digital download on June 9, 2011.157
Synopsis
The music video begins with Knowles preparing herself for her wedding ceremony. She is in her boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Knowles looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming the subject of the song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Knowles playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Knowles in high school are shown. Knowles is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Knowles and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Knowles alone on the dance floor.158 The video then returns to the present, with Knowles in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Knowles and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Knowles looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.159
