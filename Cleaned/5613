John (24 December 1166 &lt;U+2013&gt; 19 October 1216), also known as John Lackland or Softsword, was King of England from 6 April 1199 until his death. His reign saw the loss of the duchy of Normandy to the French king Philip II in 1204, resulting in the collapse of most of the Angevin Empire and the subsequent growth in the power of the Capetian dynasty over the rest of the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign saw the signing of the Magna Carta, a document often considered to be an early step in the evolution of the constitution of the United Kingdom.
As the youngest of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, John was at first not expected to inherit significant lands. Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and the continent. John's elder brothers Henry and Geoffrey died young with the result that by the time that Richard became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade. John was proclaimed king of England after Richard died in 1199, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise his right to the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.
After war broke out again with Philip in 1202, John achieved early victories against his enemies but shortages of military resources and his treatment of Norman, Breton and Anjou nobles resulted in the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1204. John spent much of the next decade attempting to regain these lands, raising huge revenues, reforming his armed forces and rebuilding continental alliances. John's judicial reforms had a lasting, positive impact on the English common law system. An argument with Pope Innocent III led to John's excommunication in 1209, a dispute finally settled by the king in 1213. John's attempt to defeat Philip in 1214 failed due to the French victory over John's allies at the battle of Bouvines. Returning to England, John faced a rebellion from many of his barons, who were unhappy with his fiscal policies and his treatment of many of England's most powerful nobles. Although both John and barons agreed the Magna Carta peace treaty in 1215, neither side complied with its conditions. Civil war broke out shortly afterwards, the barons aided by Prince Louis of France, but soon descended into a stalemate. John died of dysentery contracted whilst on campaign in eastern England during late 1216; supporters of his son Henry III went on to achieve victory over Louis and the rebel barons during the following year.
Contemporary chroniclers were mostly critical of John's performance as king, and his reign has since been subject to significant debate and periodic revision by historians from the 16th century onwards. Historian Jim Bradbury has summarised the contemporary historical opinion of John's positive qualities, observing that John is today usually considered a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;.1 Nonetheless, modern historians agree that he also had many faults as king, including what historian Ralph Turner describes as &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, such as pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.2 These negative qualities provided extensive material for fiction writers in the Victorian era, and John remains a recurring character within Western popular culture, primarily as a villain in films and stories depicting the Robin Hood legends.
Early life (1166-1189)
Childhood and the Angevin inheritance
John was born to Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166.3 Henry had inherited significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard &lt;U+2013&gt; Anjou, Normandy and England - and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany.4 Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who controlled the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and the Auvergne in southern France.5 The result was the Angevin Empire, so called because of the Count of Anjou&lt;U+2019&gt;s traditional seat in the city of Angers.{{#tag:ref|The term Angevin Empire originates with Victorian historian Kate Norgate.6|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The Angevin Empire of Henry II was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures.7 Indeed, as one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of royal power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire, such as Normandy and England, were slowly dissolving over time.8 It was also unclear what would happen to the empire on Henry&lt;U+2019&gt;s death. Although the tradition of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly growing in popularity across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England.9 Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, with the king hoping that his children would then continue to work together as allies after his death.10 To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was technically owned by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France, the rival line of the Capetians. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.11
Shortly after his birth, John was passed from Eleanor into the care of a wet nurse, a traditional practice for medieval noble families.12 Eleanor then left for Poitiers, the capital of Aquitaine, sending John and his sister Joan north to Fontevrault Abbey.13 This may have been done with the aim of steering John, as her youngest son without an obvious inheritance, towards a future ecclesiastical career.14 Eleanor spent the next few years conspiring against her husband Henry and neither parent played a part in John&lt;U+2019&gt;s very early life.15 John was probably, like his brothers, assigned a magister whilst he was at Fontevrault, a teacher charged with both his early education and managing the servants of his immediate household; John was also later taught by Ranulph Glanville, a leading English administrator.16 John also spent some time as a member of his brother Henry the Young King's household, probably receiving instruction in hunting and military skills.17
John would grow up to be around 5Â ft 5 in high (1.62 m), relatively short for royalty of the day, with a &quot;powerful, barrel-chested body&quot; and dark red hair; he appeared to contemporaries to look like an inhabitant of Poitou.18 John enjoyed reading and was unusual for the period in building up a travelling library of books.19 He enjoyed gambling, in particular backgammon, and was an enthusiastic hunter even by medieval standards.20 He liked music, although not songs.21 John would also become a &quot;connoisseur of jewels&quot;, building up a large collection, and become famous for his taste in rich clothes; French chroniclers, however, believed that John had a rather poor taste in wines.22 As John grew up, he became known for being potentially &quot;genial, witty, generous and hospitable&quot;; at other moments, he could be jealous, over-sensitive and prone to fits of rage, &quot;biting and gnawing his fingers&quot; in anger.23 {{#tag:ref|Henry II also bit and gnawed his fingers; extreme rage is considered by many historians to be a trait of the Angevin kings.24|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}
Early life
 During John's early years, Henry attempted to resolve the question of his succession. Henry&lt;U+2019&gt;s eldest son, Henry, had been crowned King of England in 1170, but without being given any formal powers by his father, and was also promised Normandy and Anjou as part of his future inheritance; Richard was in due course to be appointed the Count of Poitou and be given control of Aquitaine, whilst Geoffrey was to become the Duke of Brittany.25 At this time it seemed unlikely that John would ever inherit substantial lands and John was jokingly nicknamed &quot;Lackland&quot; by his father.26
Henry II wanted to secure the southern borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy.27 As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piemonte, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert.28 For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John&lt;U+2019&gt;s name, although as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes.29 Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this, since although he had yet to be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were still effectively his future property and had been given away without consultation.30 Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before being actually marrying John, leaving the prince once again without an inheritance.31
In 1173 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s elder brothers, backed by Eleanor, rose in revolt against Henry in the short-lived rebellion of 1173 to 1174. Henry the Young King had grown irritated with his subordinate position to Henry II and increasingly worried that John might be given additional lands and castles at his expense.32 As a result of this, Henry the Young King travelled to Paris and allied himself with Louis VII.33 Eleanor, irritated by her husband's persistent interference in Aquitaine, encouraged Richard and Geoffrey to join her eldest son in Paris.34 Henry II triumphed over the coalition of his sons, but was generous to them in the peace settlement agreed at Montlouis.35 Henry the Young King was allowed to travel widely in Europe with his own household of knights; Richard was given Aquitaine back; Geoffrey was allowed to return to Brittany: only Eleanor was imprisoned for her role in the revolt.36
John had spent the conflict travelling alongside his father and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire as part of the Montlouis settlement; from then onwards, most observers regarded John as Henry II&lt;U+2019&gt;s favourite child, although still the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession.37 Henry II began to find more lands for John, mostly at various nobles' expense. In 1175 he rather questionably appropriated the estates of the late Earl of Cornwall and gave them to John.38 The following year, Henry disinherited the sisters of Isabelle of Gloucester and betrothed John to the - now extremely wealthy - Isabelle, again contrary to legal custom.39 In 1177, at the Council of Oxford, Henry dismissed William FitzAldelm as the Lord of Ireland and replaced him with the ten year old John instead.40
 Henry the Young King fought a short war with his brother Richard in 1183 over the respective statuses of England, Normandy and Aquitaine.41 Henry II moved in support of Richard, and Henry the Young King died from a case of dysentery at end of the campaign.42 With his eldest son dead, Henry rearranged the plans for the succession: Richard was to be made King of England, albeit without any actual power until the death of his father; Geoffrey would retain Brittany, but John would now become the Duke of Aquitaine in place of Richard.43 Richard was less than impressed with this plan and refused to give up Aquitaine.44 Henry II was furious and ordered John, with help from Geoffrey, to march south and retake the duchy by force.45 The two attacked the capital of Poitiers, and Richard responded by attacking Brittany.46 The war ended in stalemate and a tense family reconciliation in England at the end of 1184.47
In 1185 John made his first visit to Ireland, accompanied by three hundred knights, as well as a team of administrators.48 Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III would not agree.49 John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland at the time had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants.50 John infamously offended the local Irish lords by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.51
The problems amongst John's wider family continued to grow. His elder brother Geoffrey died during a tournament in 1186, leaving only a young son, Arthur.52 This meant that John could not be granted the duchy of Brittany, which would need to be given to Arthur, but did bring John slightly closer to the throne of England.53 The uncertainty about what would happen after Henry's death continued to grow; Richard was keen to join a new crusade and remained concerned that whilst he was away Henry would appoint John his formal successor.54 Richard began discussions about a potential alliance with Philip II in Paris during 1187, and the next year Richard gave homage to Philip in exchange for support for a war against Henry.55 Richard and Philip fought a joint campaign against Henry, and by the summer of 1189 the king made peace, promising Richard the succession.56 John initially remained loyal to his father, but changed sides once it appeared that Richard would win.57 Henry died shortly afterwards.58
Richard's reign (1190-9)
 John's elder brother, Richard, became king in September 1189, having already declared his intent to join the Third Crusade.59 Richard set about raising the huge sums of money required for this expedition through the sale of lands, titles and appointments, and also attempted to ensure that he would not face a revolt during his time away from his empire.60 John was made the count of Mortain, finally married to the wealthy Isabel of Gloucester, given valuable lands in Lancaster and the counties of Cornwall, Derby, Devon, Dorset, Nottingham and Somerset, all with the aim of buying his loyalty to Richard whilst the king was on crusade.61 Richard was careful, though, to retain royal control of the key castles in these counties, thereby preventing John from accumulating too much military and political power.62 In return, John promised not to visit England for the next three years, thereby in theory giving Richard adequate time to conduct a successful crusade and return from the Levant, without fear of John seizing power.63 Richard left political authority in England - the post of justiciar - in the hands of Bishop Hugh de Puiset and William Mandeville, and made the papal legate William Longchamp his chancellor.64 Mandeville promptly died, however, and Longchamp took over as joint justiciar with Puiset, which would prove a less than satisfactory partnership.65 Eleanor, the queen mother, then convinced Richard to allow John to return to England, which Richard agreed to before leaving on crusade.66
The political situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate. Longchamp refused to work with Pusiet and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy.67 John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler, complete with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy for himself to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king.68 Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London, with John in control of the city of London around it, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive.69 At this point Walter of Coutances, the archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent to restore order by Richard.70 John's position was undermined both by Walter's relatively popularity and by the news that Richard had married whilst in Cyprus, presenting the possibility that Richard would have legitimate children of his own.71
The political turmoil did not cease. John began to explore the potential for an alliance with the French king Philip II, freshly returned from the crusade, in which John might acquire Normandy, Anjou and the other lands in France held by Richard in exchange for allying himself with Philip.72 John was only persuaded against doing so by his mother.73 Longchamp, who had left England after Walter's intervention, now returned, arguing that he had been wrongly removed as justiciar.74 John intervened himself, assisting in suppressing Longchamp's claims in return for promises of support from the royal administration, including reaffirming his position as heir to the throne.75 When Richard still did not reappear from the crusade, John began to assert that his brother was dead or otherwise permanently lost.76 It emerged that Richard had in fact been captured en route to England by the Duke of Austria and handed over to Emperor Henry VI, who proceeded to hold him for ransom.77 Seizing the opportunity, John went to Paris where he formed an alliance with Philip, agreeing to set aside his wife Isabella of Gloucester and marry Philip's sister, Alys, in exchange for Philip's support.78 Fighting began to break out in England between forces loyal to Richard and those being gathered by John.79 John's military position was weak and he agreed to a truce; in early 1194 the king finally returned to England, and John's remaining forces surrendered.80 John himself had retreated to Normandy, where Richard finally found him later that year.81 Richard declared that his younger brother - despite being 27 years old - was merely &quot;a child who has had evil counsellors&quot;, and forgave him, although removed his lands with the exception of Ireland.82
For the remaining years of Richard's reign, John supported his brother on the continent, apparently loyally.83 Richard's policy on the continent was to attempt to regain the castles he had lost to Philip II whilst on crusade through steady, limited campaigns, allying himself with the leaders of Flanders, Boulogne and the Holy Roman Empire - a &quot;German strategy&quot;.84 In 1195 John successfully conducted a sudden attack and siege of &lt;U+00C9&gt;vreux castle, subsequently managing the defences of Normandy against Philip.85 The following year, John seized the town of Gamaches, and led a raiding party within 50 miles (80Â km) of Paris, capturing the bishop of Beauvais.86 In return for this service, Richard withdrew his malevontia, or ill-will, towards John, restored him to the county of Gloucestershire and made him the Count of Mortain.87
Early reign (1199-1204)
Accession to the throne, 1199
 After Richard's death on 6 April 1199 there were two potential claimants to the Angevin throne: John, whose claim rested on being the sole surviving son of Henry II, and young Arthur of Brittany, who held a claim as the son of Geoffrey.88 Medieval law gave little guidance as to how the competing claims should be decided, with Norman law favouring John, and Angevin law favouring Arthur, and the matter rapidly became an open conflict.89 John was supported by the bulk of the English and Norman nobility and was crowned at Westminster, backed by his mother, Eleanor. Arthur, though, was supported by the majority of Breton, Maine and Anjou nobles and received the support of Philip II, who remained committed to breaking up the Angevin territories on the continent.90 With Arthur's army pressing up the Loire valley towards Angers and Philip's forces moving down the valley toward Tours, John risked having his continental empire cut in two.91
Warfare in Normandy at the time was shaped by the defensive potential of castles and the increasing costs of conducting campaigns.92 The Norman frontiers had limited natural defences but were heavily reinforced with castles, such as Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau Gaillard, at strategic points, built and maintained at considerable expense.93 It was difficult for a commander to advance far into fresh territory without having secured his lines of communication by capturing these fortifications, slowing the progress of any attack.94 Armies of the period could be formed from either feudal or mercenary forces.95 Feudal levies could only be raised for a fixed length of time and proved an inflexible asset; mercenary forces, often called Braban&lt;U+00E7&gt;ons after the Duchy of Brabant but actually recruited from across northern Europe, could provide much greater military agility and operate all year long, but cost much more than equivalent feudal forces.96
After his coronation, John moved south across into France with military forces and adopted a defensive posture along the eastern and southern Normandy borders.97 Both sides then paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced; John's position was now stronger, thanks to confirmation that Count Baldwin of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti-French alliances they had previously agreed with Richard.98 The powerful Anjou nobleman William de Roche was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John: suddenly the balance seemed to tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John.99 Neither side was keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to agree possible terms for peace.100 From John&lt;U+2019&gt;s perspective, what then followed represented an opportunity to stabilise his control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur.101{{#tag:ref|Nonetheless, the treaty did offer Arthur certain protections as John's vassal.102|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} John, in turn, abandoned Richard&lt;U+2019&gt;s former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne, and accepted Philip's rights as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's lands in France.103 John's policy earned him the disrespectful title of &quot;John Softsword&quot; amongst some English chroniclers, who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive brother, Richard.104
Le Goulet peace, 1200-2
 The new peace would only last for two years, war recommencing in the aftermath of John decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place &lt;U+2013&gt; as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this.105 it remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by a sexual desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl.106 On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, strengthening significantly his grip on Aquitaine.107
Unfortunately, Isabella had already been engaged to be married to Hugh de Lusignan, an important member of a key Poitou noble family and also the brother of Raoul de Lusignan, the Count of Eu with lands along the sensitive eastern Normandy border with Philip.108 Just as John stood to benefit strategically from marrying Isabella, so the marriage threatened the interests of the Lusignans whose own lands currently provided the key route for royal goods and troops across Aquitaine.109 Rather than negotiating some form of compensation, John treated Hugh &lt;U+201C&gt;with contempt&lt;U+201D&gt;, resulting in a Lusignan uprising that was promptly crushed by John, who also intervened to surpress Raoul in Normandy.110
Although John was the Count of Poitou, and therefore the rightful feudal lord over the Lusignans, they could legitimately appeal to John&lt;U+2019&gt;s own feudal lord, Philip, in respect to decisions John took within his French lands.111 Hugh did exactly this in 1201 and Philip summoned John to attend court in Paris in 1202, citing the Le Goulet treaty to strengthen his case.112 John was unwilling to weaken his authority in western France in this way and argued that he need not attend Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s court because of his special status as the Duke of Normandy, who was exempt by feudal tradition from being called to the French court.113 Philip argued instead that he was summoning John not as the Duke of Normandy, but as the Count of Poitou, which carried no such special status.114 When John still refused to come, Philip declared John in breach of his feudal responsibilities, reassigned all of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s lands that fell under the French crown to Arthur - with the exception of Normandy which he took back for himself - and began a fresh war against John.115
Loss of Normandy, 1202-4
 John initially adopted a defensive posture similar to that in 1199, avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles.116 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip steadily began to make progress in the east.117 John became aware in July that Arthur&lt;U+2019&gt;s forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle and accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, he swung his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her.118 His turn of speed caught Arthur by surprise and the entire rebel leadership were taken prisoner at the battle of Mirebeau.119 With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John&lt;U+2019&gt;s army.120
John&lt;U+2019&gt;s position in France was considerably strengthened by the victory at Mirebeau. The king's treatment of his ally William de Roches and his new prisoners, however, quickly undermined these gains. Despite de Roches being a powerful Anjou noble, John largely ignored him, causing considerable offence, whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that twenty-two of them died.121 At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship, and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable.122 In the aftermath of these incidents, William de Roches and other of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s regional allies in Anjou and Brittany began to desert him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt.123 John's financial situation was also tenuous: once factors such as the comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account, Philip enjoyed a considerable, although not overwhelming, advantage of resources over John.124{{#tag:ref|This interpretation has been challenged by John Gillingham, whose minority view is that Richard, unlike John, successfully defended Normandy with a similar level of military resources.125|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}
The beginning of 1203 saw fresh desertions from John&lt;U+2019&gt;s local allies, steadily reducing John&lt;U+2019&gt;s freedom to manoeuvre in the region.126 He attempted to convince Pope Innocent III to intervene in the conflict, but the Pope&lt;U+2019&gt;s legate was unsuccessful.127 As the situation became worse for John, he then decided to have Arthur killed, with the aim of removing his potential rival for good and undermining the rebel movement in Brittany.128 Arthur had initially been imprisoned at Falaise and then moved to Rouen. After this, Arthur's fate remains uncertain but modern historians believe he was murdered by John.129 The annals of Margam Abbey suggested that &quot;John had captured Arthur and kept him alive in prison for some time in the castle of Rouen... when John was drunk he slew Arthur with his own hand and tying a heavy stone to the body cast it into the Seine.&quot;130{{#tag:ref|Although all modern biographers of John believe that he had his rival, Arthur, killed, the details of the Margam Abbey account can be questioned; as Frank McLynn points out, the Welsh monks appear &quot;curiously well informed&quot; about the details of the incident in France.131|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Rumours of Arthur's death further reduced support for John across the region.132 Arthur's sister, Eleanor, who had also been captured at Mirebeau, was kept imprisoned by John for many years, albeit in relatively good conditions.133
 In late 1203, John attempted to relieve Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was still guarding the eastern flank of Normandy.134 John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-born forces, considered by most historians today to have been imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully.135 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s relief operation was blocked by Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s forces, and instead John turned back to Brittany, attempting to draw Philip away from eastern Normandy.136 John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not manage to deflect Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s main thrust into the east of Normandy.137 Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.138{{#tag:ref|For positive interpretations of John's military skills in the campaign see Kate Norgate, who argues that John's attempt to relieve Ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau Gaillard was a &quot;masterpiece of ingenuity&quot;; Ralph Turner terms his performance as a general &quot;capable&quot;; Lewis Warren places the blame on John's inability to inspire loyalty amongst the local nobles, rather than a simple lack of military skill. Frank McLynn is more damning, describing the military aspects of the campaign as a &quot;disastrous failure&quot;.139|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} John&lt;U+2019&gt;s situation began to deteriorate rapidly. The eastern border region of Normandy had been extensively cultivated by Philip and his predecessors for several years, whilst Angevin authority in the south had been undermined by Richard&lt;U+2019&gt;s giving away of various key castles some years before.140 His use of routier mercenaries in the central regions had rapidly ate away his remaining support in this area too, setting the stage for a sudden collapse of Angevin power.141{{#tag:ref|David Carpenter provides an accessible summary of Power's argument on the collapse of Normandy.142|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} John retreated back across the Channel in December, sending orders for the establishment of a fresh defensive line to the west of Chateau Gaillard.143 In March 1204, Gaillard fell and John&lt;U+2019&gt;s mother, Eleanor, died the following month.144 This was not just a personal blow for John, but also threatened to unravel the widespread Angevin alliances across the far south of France.145 Philip moved south, around the new defensive line, and struck upwards at the heart of the Duchy, now facing little resistance.146 By August, Philip had taken Normandy and advanced south to occupy Anjou and Poitou as well.147 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s only remaining possessions on the Continent was now the Duchy of Aquitaine.148
John as king
Kingship and royal administration
 The nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain. John's predecessors had ruled using the principle of vis et voluntas, or &quot;force and will&quot;, taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law.149 Both Henry II and Richard had argued that kings possessed a quality of &quot;divine majesty&quot;; John continued this trend and claimed an &quot;almost imperial status&quot; for himself as ruler.150 During the 12th century, however, there were contrary opinions expressed about the nature of kingship, and many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, taking council with the leading members of the realm.151 There was as yet no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so.152 Despite his claim to unique authority within England, John would also sometimes justify his actions on the basis that he had taken council with the barons.153 Modern historians remain divided as to whether John suffered from a case of &quot;royal schizophrenia&quot; in his approach to government, or if his actions captured the complex model of Angevin kingship in the early 13th century.154
John inherited a sophisticated system of administration in England, with a range of royal agents answering to the Royal Household; the Chancery, keeping written records and communications; the Treasury and the Exchequer, dealing with income and expenditure respectively, and the various judges deployed to deliver justice around the kingdom.155 Like previous kings, John managed a peripatetic court that travelled around the kingdom, dealing with both local and national matters as he went.156 John was very active in the administration of England, becoming involved in every aspect of government.157 In part he was following in the same tradition as Henry II and Henry I, but by the 13th century the volume of administrative work had greatly increased, putting much more pressure on a king who wished to rule in this style.158 Furthermore, John was in England for much longer periods than his predecessors, making his rule more personal than had been the case before, particularly in hitherto ignored areas such as the north.159
The administration of justice was of particular importance to John. Several new processes had been introduced to English law under Henry II, including novel disseisin and mort d'ancestor.160 These gave a significant role to the royal courts to intervene in local law cases, previously dealt with only by regional or local lords.161 John also increased the skills and independence of local sergeants, bailiffs and created local coronors.162 John worked extremely hard to ensure that this system operated well, through judges he had appointed, fostering legal specialists and expertise, and by intervening in cases himself.163 John continued to try relatively minor cases even during military crises.164 Viewed positively, John discharged &quot;his royal duty of providing justice... with a zeal and a tirelessness to which the English common law is greatly endebted&quot;.165 Seen more critically, John may have been motivated by the potential of the royal legal process to raise fees, rather than a desire to deliver simple justice; John's legal system also only applied to free men, rather than to all of the population.166 Nonetheless, these changes were popular with many free tenants, who acquired a more reliable legal system that could by-pass the barons against whom such cases were often brought.167 John's reforms were less popular with the barons themselves, especially as they remained subject to arbitrary and frequently vindictive royal justice themselves.168
Economy
 One of John's principal challenges was acquiring the large sums of money needed for his proposed campaigns to reclaim Normandy.169 The Angevin kings had three main sources of income available to them, namely revenue from their personal lands, or demesne; money raised through their rights as a feudal lord, and revenue from taxation. Revenue from the royal demesne was inflexible and had been diminishing slowly since the conquest, not helped by Richard's sale of many royal properties in 1189, and taxation played a much smaller role in royal income than in later centuries. An English king had widespread feudal rights which could be used to generate income, however, including the scutage system, in which feudal military service was transmuted to a cash payment to the king, fines, court fees and selling charters and other privileges.170 John intensified his efforts to maximise all possible sources of income, to the extent that he has been described as &quot;avaricious, miserly, extortionate and moneyminded&quot;.171 John also used revenue generation as a way of exerting political control over the barons: debts owed to the crown might be forgiven to the king's favoured supporters, or stringently enforces against his enemies.
The result was a sequence of innovative but unpopular financial measures.{{#tag:ref|The degree to which John was a genuine innovator in financial matters, as opposed to simply embracing expediency, has been contested. Frank Barlow, for example, argues that John was exercising a policy of expediency rather than genuine reform.172|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} John levied scutage payments eleven times in seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total during the reign of the preceding three monarchs.173 In many cases these were levied in the absence of any actual military campaign, running counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service.174 John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay.175 Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, a new round of appointments were made, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased fines and penalties, particularly in the forests.176 Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John.177 John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and markets across the kingdom and in Gascony.178{{#tag:ref|One consequence of this was an expansion of the wine trade with the Continent. In 1203, John exempted the citizens and merchants of Bordeaux from the Grande Coutume, which was the principal tax on their exports. In exchange, the regions of Bordeaux, Bayonne and Dax pledged support against the French Crown. The unblocked ports gave Gascon merchants open access to the English wine market for the first time. The following year, John granted the same exemptions to La Rochelle and Poitou.179|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} The king also introduced new taxes and extending existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; &lt;U+00A3&gt;44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210, much of it passed on in turn to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders.180181 John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207, effectively a version of a modern income tax, producing &lt;U+00A3&gt;60,000; he also created a new set of import and export duties, payable directly to the crown.182 John also found that these measures enabled to him to raise further resources by permitting the confiscation the lands of barons who could not, or refused, to pay.183
 At the start of John's reign there was a sudden change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food resulted in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue for the rest of the 13th century and had long term economic consequences for England.184 The social pressures resulting from these higher prices was complicated by the bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns.185 It was normal at the time for the king to collect in silver to be re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet other costs.186 At those moments when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, unintentionally resulting in periods in which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy, resulting in political unrest across the country.187 John attempted to address some of these problems with the English currency between 1204-5, carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage and improving its quality and consistency.188
Royal household and ira et malevolentia
 John's royal household was based around several groups of followers. One element of these were the familiares regis, John's immediate friends and knights who travelled around the country with the king, also playing an important part in organising and leading military campaigns.189 Another section of royal followers were the curia regis; these curiales were the senior officials and agents of the king, essential to his day to day rule.190 Being a member of these inner circles brought huge advantages, as it was easier to gain favours from the king, apply law suits, marry a wealthy heiress or have one's debts remitted.191 There had been a trend since Henry II for these posts to be filled by &quot;new men&quot; from outside the normal ranks of the barons. This intensified under John's rule, with many lesser nobles, frequently mercenary leaders from Poitou, arriving from the continent to take up positions in his court.192 These men included many soldiers whose behaviour would become infamous in England, including Falkes de Breaut&lt;U+00E9&gt;, Geard d'Athies, Engelard de Cigong&lt;U+00E9&gt; and Philip Marc.193 The result was many barons perceived the king's household as a &quot;narrow clique enjoying royal favour at barons' expense&quot;, staffed by men of lesser status than their own.194
This trend for the king to rely on his own men at the expense of the barons was exacerbated by the tradition of Angevin royal ira et malevolentia - &quot;anger and ill-will&quot; - and John's own personality.195 From Henry II onwards, ira et malevolentia had come to describe the right of the king to express his anger and displeasure at particular barons or clergy, building on the Norman concept of malevoncia - royal ill-will.196 In the Norman period, suffering the king's ill-will had resulted in difficulties in obtaining grants, honours or petitions; Henry II had infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards Thomas Becket, ultimately resulting in Becket's death.197 John, however, now had the ability to &quot;cripple his vassals&quot; on a significant scale using his new economic and judicial measures, making the threat of royal anger all the more serious.198
John was deeply suspicious of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king.199 Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up as a model of utter loyalty.200 The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, proved to be that William de Briouze, a power Marcher lord with lands in Ireland.201 De Briouze was subjected to punitive demands for money and when he refused to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt;26,666 at the time),202 his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, resulting in their death.203 De Briouze himself died in exile in 1211, with his grandsons remaining in prison until 1218.204 John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.205
Personal life
A 13th century depiction of John and his legitimate children, (l to r) Henry, Richard, Joan, Isabella and Eleanor
Aspects of John's personal life impacted heavily on his reign, highlighted in accounts from contemporary chroniclers stating that John was both sinfully lustful and lacking in piety.206 It was quite normal for kings and nobles of the period to keep mistresses, but chroniclers complained that John's mistresses were married noblewomen, which was considered unacceptable.207 John certainly had at least five children to mistresses during his first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, and two of those mistresses are known to have been noblewomen.208 John's behaviour after his second marriage to Isabella is less clear, however. None of John's known illegitimate children were born after he remarried, and there is no actual documentary proof of adultery after that point, although John certainly had female friends amongst the court throughout the period.209 The specific accusations made against John during the baronial revolts are now generally considered to have been invented for the purposes of justifying the revolt; nonetheless, most of John's contemporaries seem to have held a poor opinion of his sexual behaviour.210 {{#tag:ref|The most notable piece of evidence for any later royal affairs is the famous entry on the fine roll of Christmas 1204 involving Hugh de Neville's wife. This entry notes that de Neville's wife offered the king 200 chickens if she could spend a night with her husband, Hugh. This is conventionally interpreted as implying that she was having an affair with the king but in this case wished to have conjugal sex with her husband instead - thus the humorous fine. An alternative explanation is that she was tired of Hugh being sent away on royal service and the fine was a light-hearted way of convincing John to ensure that her husband remained at court for a night.211|group=&quot;nb&quot;}}
The character of John's relationship with his second wife, Isabella of Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me, is unclear. John married Isabella whilst she was relatively young - her exact date of birth is uncertain, and estimates place her between at most 15 and more probably towards nine years old at the time of her marriage.212{{#tag:ref|These estimates are based on chronicler accounts, the date of Isabella's parents' marriage and on the date of birth of her first child.213|group=&quot;nb&quot;}} Even by the standards at the time, Isabella was married whilst still very young.214 John did not provide a great deal of money for his wife's household and many of the lands and revenues owed to her were never being passed on by John, to the extent that historian Nicholas Vincent has described him as being &quot;downright mean&quot; towards Isabella.215 Vincent has concluded that the marriage was not a particularly &quot;amicable&quot; one.216 Other aspects of their marriage suggest a closer, more positive relationship. Chroniclers recorded that John had a &quot;mad infatuation&quot; with Isabella, and certainly John had conjugal relationships with Isabella between at least 1207 to 1215, having five children by her.217 In contrast to Vincent, historian William Chester Jordan concludes that the pair were a &quot;companionable couple&quot; who had a successful marriage by the standards of the day.218
John's lack of religious conviction has been noted both by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that John was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time.219 Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion; his blasphemous remarks; his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including the king's jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection; and commented on the paucity of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s charitable donations to the church.220 Historian Frank McLynn argues that John&lt;U+2019&gt;s early years at Fontevrault, combined with his own relatively advanced education, may have combined to turn him against the church.221 Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John&lt;U+2019&gt;s personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, later declared a saint.222 Financial records show a normal royal household, engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances - albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance.223
Later reign (1204-1214)
Continental policy
 At the heart of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s foreign policy during the remainder of his reign was his intent to retake Normandy.224 The available evidence suggests that John regarded the loss of the Duchy as only a temporary loss, not a permanent shift in Capetian power.225 Strategically, John faced several challenges before he could mount an operation to retake Normandy.226 England itself had to be secured against possible French invasion.227 His remaining possessions in Aquitaine needed to be secured following the death of his mother, Eleanor, and the sea-routes to Bordeaux secured following the loss of the land route to Aquitaine.228 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s preferred plan for eventually retaking Normandy was to use Poitou as a base of operations, advancing up the Loire valley to threaten Paris, pinning down French forces and breaking Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s internal lines of communication, before landing a maritime force in the Duchy itself.229 Ideally, this plan would benefit from the opening of a second front on Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s eastern frontiers with Flanders and Boulogne &lt;U+2013&gt; effectively the recreation of Richard&lt;U+2019&gt;s old &lt;U+201C&gt;German strategy&lt;U+201D&gt;.230 All of this would, of course, require a great deal of money and soldiers.231
John spent much of 1205 securing England against a potential French invasion.232 As an emergency measure, John recreated a version of Henry II's Assize of Arms, with each shire creating a structure to mobilise local levies.233 When this threat faded, John formed a large military force in England, intended for Poitou, and another large fleet with soldiers under his own command intended for Normandy itself.234 To achieve this, John reformed the English feudal contribution to his campaigns, creating a more flexible system under which only one knight in every ten would actually be mobilised to fight, but would be financially supported by the other nine and serve for an indefinite period.235 John built up a strong team of engineers for siege warfare, and a substantial force of professional crossbowmen.236 The king was supported by a team of leading barons with military expertise, including William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, William the Marshal, Roger de Lacy and, until he fell from favour, the marcher lord William de Braose.237
John had already begun to improving his Channel forces before the loss of Normandy and he rapidly built up further maritime capabilities after its collapse. Most of these ships were placed along the Cinque Ports, with Portsmouth being specifically enlarged.238 By the end of 1204, he had around 50 large galleys available to him, with another 54 vessels being built between 1209 and 1212.239 William of Wrotham was appointed &quot;keeper of the galleys&quot;, effectively John&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief admiral.240 Wortham was responsible for fusing John&lt;U+2019&gt;s galleys, the ships of the Cinque Ports and pressed merchant vessels into a single operational fleet.241 John adopted recent improvements were made in ship design, including new large transport ships called buisses and removable forecastles for use in combat.242 Historian Lewis Warren describes the result as the &quot;emergence of England as a maritime power&quot;.243
 Baronial unrest in England, however, prevented the departure of the planned 1205 expedition, and eventually only a smaller force under William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e deployed to Poitou.244 In 1206 John finally deployed to Poitou himself, but was forced to divert south to counter a threat to Gascony from Alfonso VIII of Castile.245 After a successful campaign against Alfonso, John headed north again, taking the city of Angers.246 Philip moved south himself to meet John, and the year ended in stalemate and an agreement of a two-year truce between the two rulers.247
During the truce of 1206 to 1208, John focused on building up his financial and military resources, in preparation for another attempt to recapture Normandy.248 John used some of this money to pay for new alliances on Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s eastern frontiers, where the growth in Capetian power was beginning to concern French neighbours.249 By 1212 John had successfully concluded alliances with Renault of Dammartin who controlled Boulogne, and Count Ferdinand of Flanders, as well as Otto Welf, one of the rival contenders for the crown of the Holy Roman Emperor in Germany.250 The invasion plans for 1212 were postponed because of fresh English baronial unrest about service in Poitou.251 Philip seized the initiative in 1213, sending his son, Prince Louis, to invade Flanders with the intent of then launching an invasion of England.252 John was forced to postpone his own invasion plans to counter this threat, launching his new fleet to attack the French at the harbour of Damme.253 The attack was a success, destroying Philip&lt;U+2019&gt;s own vessels and any chances of an invasion of England that year.254 John hoped to exploit this advantage by invading himself late in 1213, but again baronial discontent prevented his plans.255 Instead John was forced to delay his invasion plans until early 1214, in what would prove his final Continental campaign.256
Scotland, Ireland and Wales
 In the late 12th and early 13th centuries the border and political relationship between England and Scotland was disputed, with the kings of Scotland claiming parts of what is now northern England. John's father, Henry II, had forced William of Scotland to swear fealty to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174.257 This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189, but the relationship remained uneasy.258 John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties, refusing William's request for earldom of Northumbria, but did not intervene into Scotland itself and instead focussed on his continental problems.259 The two kings maintained a friendly relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207.260 The relationship changed in 1209, when rumours began to circulate that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France.261 John promptly invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham, giving John control of William's daughters and requiring a payment of &lt;U+00A3&gt;10,000.262 This effectively crippled William's power north of the border and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals, this time marrying his daughter Joan to William's son, Alexander II.263 John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise, though, and both William and Alexander remained independent kings, supported by, but not owing fealty, to John.264
John remained Lord of Ireland throughout his reign, drawing on the country for resources to fight his war with Philip on the continent.265 Conflict continued in Ireland between the Anglo-Norman settlers and the indigenous Irish chieftains, with John manipulating both to expand his wealth and power in the country.266 During the years of Richard's rule, John had successfully increased the size of his lands in Ireland and continued this policy as king.267 In 1210 the king crossed into Ireland with a large army to crush a rebellion by the Anglo-Norman lords; he reasserted his control of the country, laying down a new charter ordering compliance with English laws and customs in Ireland.268 John stopped short of actively applying this charter to the native Irish kingdoms, but he may have been considering doing so had the baronial conflict in England not intervened: certainly simmering tensions remained with the native Irish leaders even after John left for the England.269
Royal power in Wales was unevenly applied, with the country divided between the marcher lords along the borders, royal territories in Pembrokeshire and the more independent native Welsh lords of North Wales. John knew the country well and took a close interest in Wales, visiting the region every year between 1204 to 1211 and marrying his illegitimate daughter, Joan, to the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great.270 The king used both the marcher lords and the native Welsh to increase his own territory and power, striking a sequence of increasingly precise deals with the Welsh rulers over the period, backed by royal military power.271 A major royal expedition to enforce these occurred in 1211, after Llywelyn attempted to exploit the instability caused by the removal of William de Braose, through the Welsh uprising.272 John's invasion, striking into the Welsh heartlands, was a military success and Llywelyn came to terms that included a expansion of John's power across much of Wales, albeit one that would prove only temporary.273
Dispute with the Pope
 When Archbishop of Canterbury Hubert Walter died on 13 July 1205, John became involved in a dispute with Pope Innocent III that would lead to the king's excommunication. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power and autonomy over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message, emphasising the importance of the church being &quot;governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre&quot; and establishing &quot;its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler&quot;.274 After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, albeit with an element of concern about centralising authority of Rome.275 This began to bring the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.276 Pope Innocent himself was an &quot;ambitious and aggressive&quot; religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church.277
John wanted John de Gray, the bishop of Norwich and one of his own supporters, to be appointed Archbishop of Canterbury after the death of Walter, but the Canterbury Cathedral chapter claimed the exclusive right to elect Hubert's successor, favouring Reginald, the local sub-prior.278 To complicate matters, the bishops of the surrounding province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop themselves.279 The chapter secretly elected Reginald as archbishop, who then travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged this ruling and the matter was taken before Innocent.280 Meanwhile, John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support in favour of John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the Pope of the new decision.281 Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton, as archbishop; Innocent invited John to agree to Langton&lt;U+2019&gt;s appointment and when he did not, consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207.282
John was incensed about what he perceived as an abrogation of his customary rights as monarch to influence the election.283 He complained both about the choice of Langton as an individual, as John felt he was overly influenced by the Capetian court in Paris, and about the process as a whole.284 John responded by barring Langton from entering England and seizing the lands of the archbishopric and other papal possessions.285 Innocent set a commission in place to try to convince John to change his mind but to no avail. In reply, Innocent placed an interdict on England in March 1208, prohibiting clergy to conduct religious services with the exception of baptisms and confessions and absolutions for the dying.286
 John treated the interdict as &quot;the equivalent of a papal declaration of war&quot;.287 He responded by attempting both to punish Innocent personally and to drive a wedge in between those English clergy that might support him and those allying themselves firmly to the authorities in Rome.288 John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services, as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself; he arrested the illicit lovers that many clerics kept during the period, only releasing them after the payment of fines; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England, and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him.289 In many cases, individual institutions were able to negotiate terms for managing their own properties and keeping the produce of their estates.290 By 1209 the situation showed no signs of resolution, and Innocent threatened to excommunicate John if he did not acquiesce to Langton&lt;U+2019&gt;s appointment.291 When this threat failed, Innocent excommunicated the king in November 1209.292 Although this was theoretically a significant blow to John&lt;U+2019&gt;s legitimacy, it did not appear to greatly worry the king.293 Two of John&lt;U+2019&gt;s close allies &lt;U+2013&gt; Emperor Otto and Count Raymond VI &lt;U+2013&gt; had already been suffered the same punishment themselves, and the significance of excommunication had been somewhat devalued.294 John simply tightened his existing measures and accrued significant sums from the income of vacant sees and abbeys: one 1213 estimate, for example, suggested the church had lost an estimated 100,000 marks (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt;66,666 at the time) to John.295 The final official figures suggested that around 14% of annual income from the English church was being appropriated by John each year.296
Innocent gave some dispensations as the crisis progressed.297 Monastic communities were allowed to celebrate mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the viaticum for the dying was authorised.298 The rules on burials and lay access to churches appear to have been steadily circumvented, at least unofficially.299 Although the interdict was a burden to many believers, it certainly did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion.300 Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Philip did successfully invade England, and Innocent needed to claim the credit.301
John finally decided that the moment was right to negotiate terms for a reconciliation.302 The papal terms for submission were accepted in the presence of the papal legate Pandulph in May 1213 at the Templar Church at Dover.303 As part of the deal, John offered to surrender the Kingdom of England to the papacy for a feudal service of 1,000 marks (equivalent to &lt;U+00A3&gt;666 at the time) annually: 700 marks (&lt;U+00A3&gt;466) for England and 300 marks (&lt;U+00A3&gt;200) for Ireland, as well as recompensating the church for the lost revenue during the crisis.304 The agreement was formalised in the Bulla Aurea, or Golden Bull. This final resolution produced mixed responses. Although some chroniclers felt that John had been humiliated by sequence of events, there was little public reaction.305 Innocent certainly benefited fromh the resolution of his long-standing English problem, but John probably gained more, as Innocent became a firm supporter of John for the rest of his reign, backing him in both domestic and Continental policy issues.306 Innocent immediately turned against Philip, calling upon him to reject plans to invade England and to sue for peace.307 John did pay back some of the compensation money he had promised the church, but he ceased making payments in late 1214, leaving two thirds of the sum unpaid: Innocent appears to have conveniently forgotten this debt for the good of the wider relationship.308
Failure in France and the First Barons' War (1215-6)
The French victory at the battle of Bouvines doomed John's strategy to retake Normandy in 1214 and led to the First Barons' War
Tensions and discontent
Tensions between John and the barons had been growing for several years, as witnessed by the 1212 plot against the king.309 Many of the disaffected barons came from the north of England; that faction was often labelled by contemporaries and historians as &quot;the Northerners&quot;. The northern barons had the fewest links to the situation on the continent, and also frequently owed large sums of money to John. Thus, the eventual revolt can be characterised as &quot;a rebellion of the king's debtors&quot;.310 Many of John's military household joined the rebels too, particularly amongst those that John had appointed to administrative roles across England, where their local links and loyalties proved to outweigh their personal loyalty to John.311 Tension also grew across North Wales, where opposition to the 1211 treaty between John and Llywelyn was turning into open conflict.312 For some the appointment of Peter des Roches as justiciar was also an important factor, as the administrator was considered an &quot;abrasive foreigner&quot; by many of the barons.313 The failure of John's French military campaign in 1214 was probably the final straw; precipitating the baronial uprising during John's final years as king; James Holt describes the path to civil war as &quot;direct, short and unavoidable&quot; following the defeat at Bouvines.314
Failure of 1214 French campaign
In 1214 John began his final campaign to reclaim Normandy from Philip. The situation appeared promising, as John had successfully built up alliances with the Emperor Otto, Renaud of Boulogne and Count Ferdinand of Flanders; he was enjoying papal favour; he had successfully built up substantial funds to pay for the deployment of his experienced army.315 Nonetheless, when John left for Poitou in February 1214 many barons refused to provide military service, with mercenary knights filling the gaps.316 John's plan was to split Philip's forces by pushing north-east from Poitou towards Paris, whilst Otto, Renaud and Ferdinand, supported by William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, marched south-west from Flanders.317
The first part of the campaign went well, with John out-manoeuvring the forces under the command of Prince Louis and retaking the county of Anjou by the end of June.318 John besieged the castle of Roche-au-Moine, a key stronghold, forcing Louis to give battle against John's larger army.319 The local Angevin nobles, however, refused to advance with the king: left at something of a disadvantage, John retreated back to La Rochelle.320 Shortly afterwards, Philip won the hard-fought battle of Bouvines in the east against Otto and John's other allies, bringing an end to John's hopes of retaking Normandy.321 A peace agreement was signed in which John returned Anjou to Philip and paid the French king compensation; the truce was intended to last for six years.322 John arrived back in England in October.323
Pre-war tensions
 Within a few months of John's return, rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising themselves in resistance to his rule.324 John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms and sponsored discussions between his agents and the rebels in Oxford during the spring.325 John appears to have been playing for time until Pope Innocent III could send letters giving him explicit papal support; this was particularly important for John, not just as a way of pressuring the barons, but it would be a way of controlling Stephen Langton, the archbishop of Canterbury.326 In the meantime, John began to recruit fresh mercenary forces from Poitou, although some were later sent back in an effort to avoid the impression that the king was escalating the conflict.327 John announced his intent to become a crusader, a move which gave him additional political protection under church law.328
Letters of support from the pope duly arrived in April but by then the rebel barons had organised themselves sufficiently to congregate at Northampton in May and renounce their feudal ties to John, appointing Robert fitz Walter as their military leader.329 This self-proclaimed &quot;Army of God&quot; marched on London, taking the capital as well as Lincoln and Exeter.330 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London they began to attract a fresh wave of defectors from John&lt;U+2019&gt;s royalist faction.331 Langton was instructed by John to organise peace talks between the king and the rebel barons.332
John met the rebel leaders at Runnymede, near Windsor Castle on 15 June 1215.333 Langton&lt;U+2019&gt;s efforts at mediation created a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; it was later renamed the Magna Carta, or &quot;Great Charter&quot;.334 The charter went beyond simply addressing specific baronial complaints, forming a wider proposal for political reform, albeit one focusing on the rights of free men, not serfs and unfree labour.335 It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, new taxation only with baronial consent and limitations on scutage and other feudal payments.336 A council of twenty five neutral barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter, whilst the rebel army would be stood down and London surrendered to the king.337
Neither John nor the rebel barons seriously attempted to implement the peace accord.338 The rebel barons suspected that that the proposed baronial council would be unacceptable to John and that he would challenge the legality of the charter: they packed the baronial council with their own hardliners and refused to demobilise their forces or surrender London as agreed.339 Despite his previous promises to the contrary, John promptly appealed to Innocent for help, observing that the charter compromised the pope&lt;U+2019&gt;s rights under the 1203 agreement that had appointed him John&lt;U+2019&gt;s feudal lord.340 Innocent obliged, declaring the charter &quot;not only shameful and demeaning, but illegal and unjust&quot; and excommunicating the rebel barons.341 The failure of the agreement led rapidly to the First Barons' War.342
War with the barons
 The rebels made the first move in the war, seizing the strategic location of Rochester Castle, owned by Langton but which had been left almost unguarded by the archbishop.343 John, however, was well prepared for a conflict. He had stockpiled money to pay for mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful Marcher lords with their own feudal forces, such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester.344 A network of royal castles effectively cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south, and the rebels lacked the engineering expertise or heavy equipment necessary to assault them.345 John&lt;U+2019&gt;s strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London; protect his own supply lines to Flanders, his key source of mercenaries; prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition.346 John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading an rebellion against the 1211 settlement.347
John's campaign started well. In November, John retook Rochester Castle in a sophisticated assault: one chronicler noted that they had not seen &quot;a siege so hard pressed or so strongly resisted&quot;, whilst historian Reginald Brown describes it as the &quot;one of the greatest [siege] operations in England up to that time&quot;.348 Having regained the south-east, John split his forces, sending William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e to retake the north of side of London and East Anglia, whilst John himself headed north via Nottingham, to attack the estates of the northern barons.349 Both operations were successful, leaving the majority of the remaining rebels pinned down in London.350 In January 1216 John marched against Alexander II of Scotland, who had allied himself with the rebel cause.351 John took back Alexander&lt;U+2019&gt;s possessions in northern England in a rapid campaign and pushed up towards Edinburgh over a ten-day period.352
The rebel barons responded by inviting Prince Louis of France to lead them: Louis had a claim to the English throne by virtue of his marriage to Blanche of Castile, the grand-daughter of Henry II.353 Although Phillip II may have provided him with private support, the French king refused to openly support his son, who was excommunicated by Innocent for taking part in the war against John.354 Louis' planned arrival in England presented a significant problem for John, as the prince would bring with him naval vessels and siege engines, essential to the rebel cause.355 Having contained Alexander in Scotland, John marched back south to deal with the challenge of the coming invasion.356
Prince Louis intended to land in the south of England in May 1216 and John assembled a naval force to intercept him.357 Unfortunately for John, his fleet was dispersed by bad storms and Louis landed unopposed in Kent.358 John hesitated and decided not to attack Louis immediately, either due to the risks of open battle or over concerns about the loyalty of his own men.359 Louis and the rebel barons advanced west and John retreated, spending the summer reorganising his defences across the rest of the kingdom.360 John saw several of his own military household desert to the rebels, including his half brother, William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e. By the end of the summer the rebels had regained the south-east of England and parts of the north.361
Death
 In September 1216 John began a fresh, vigorous attack, marching from the Cotswolds, feigning an offensive to relieve the besieged Windsor Castle before attacking eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia.362 From there he travelled north to relieve the rebel siege at Lincoln and back east to King's Lynn, probably to order further supplies from the continent.363364 In King's Lynn, John contracted dysentery, which would ultimately prove fatal.365 Meanwhile, Alexander II invaded northern England again, taking Carlisle in August and marching south to give homage to Prince Louis; John narrowly missed intercepting Alexander along the way.366 Tensions between Louis and the English barons began to increase, however, prompting a wave of desertions, including William Marshal's son William and William Longesp&lt;U+00E9&gt;e, who both returned to John's faction.367
The king returned west, but along the way is said to have lost a significant part of his baggage train.368 Roger of Wendover provides the most graphic account of this, suggesting that the king's belongings, including the Crown Jewels, were lost as he crossed the Wash, being sucked in by quicksand and whirlpools.369 Accounts of the incident vary considerably between the various chroniclers, and the exact location of the incident has never been confirmed; the losses may have only involved a few of his pack-horses.370 Modern historians assess that by October 1216 John faced a &quot;stalemate&quot;, &quot;a military situation uncompromised by defeat&quot;.371
John's illness grew worse and by the time he reached Newark Castle he was unable to travel any further; John died on 18 October.372 Numerous, probably fictitious, accounts circulated soon after his death that he had been killed by poisoned ale, poisoned plums or a &quot;surfeit of peaches&quot;.373 Escorted south by a company of mercenaries, he was buried in Worcester Cathedral in front of the altar of St Wulfstan.374 A new sarcophagus and effigy was made for him on the site in 1232, in which his body now rests.375
Legacy
In the aftermath of John's death, William Marshal was declared the protector of the nine year old Henry III.376 The civil war continued until the royalist victories at the battles of Lincoln and Dover in 1217, which forced Louis to give up his claim to the English throne and sign the Treaty of Lambeth.377 The failed Magna Carta agreement was resuscitated by Marshal's protectorate and reissued in an edited form in 1217 as a basis for future government.378 Henry III continued his attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou until 1259, but John's continental losses and the consequent growth of Capetian power in the 13th century proved to mark a &quot;turning point in European history&quot;.379
John's first wife, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was released from imprisonment in 1214 and remarried twice, dying a year after John in 1217. John's second wife, Isabella of Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me left England for Angoul&lt;U+00EA&gt;me soon after the king's death; she became a powerful regional leader, but largely abandoned the children she had had by John.380 John had five legitimate children, all by Isabella. His eldest son, Henry III, ruled as king for most of the 13th century. Richard became a noted European leader and ultimately the King of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire.381 Joan married Alexander II of Scotland to become his Queen Consort.382 Isabella married the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.383 His youngest daughter, Eleanor, married William Marshal's son, also called William, and later the famous English rebel Simon Montfort.384 John had a number of illegitimate children by various mistresses, including nine sons - Richard, Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and probably Philip - and three daughters - Joan, Maud and probably Isabel.385 Of these, Joan became the most famous, marrying Prince Llywelyn the Great of Wales.386
Historiography
 Historical interpretations of John have been subject to considerable change over the years. Medieval chroniclers provided the first contemporary, or near contemporary, histories of John's reign. One group of chroniclers wrote early in John's life, or around the time of his accession, including Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto.387 This grouping were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard's rule, but slightly more positive towards the very earliest years of John's reign.388 Reliable accounts of the middle and later parts of John's reign are more limited, with Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall writing the main accounts, neither of them positive about John's performance as king.389 Much of John's later reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris.390
In the 16th century, political and religious changes altered the attitude of historians to John. Tudor historians were generally favourably inclined towards the king, focussing on John's opposition to the Papacy and his promotion of the special rights and prerogatives of a king. Revisionist histories written by John Foxe, William Tyndale and Robert Barnes portrayed John as an early Protestant hero, and John Foxe included the king in his Book of Martyrs.391 John Speed's Historie of Great Britaine in 1632 praised John's &quot;great renown&quot; as a king, blaming the bias of medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation.392
 By the Victorian period, however, historians were more inclined to draw on the judgements of the chroniclers and to focus on John's moral personality. Kate Norgate, for example, argued that John's downfall had been due not to his failure in war or strategy, but due to his &quot;almost superhuman wickedness&quot;, whilst James Ramsay blamed both John's family background and his cruel personality for his downfall.393 Historians in the &quot;Whiggish&quot; tradition, focused on documents such as the Domesday Book and the Magna Carta, tracing a progressive and universalist course of political and economic development in England over the medieval period.394 These historians were often inclined to see John's reign, and his signing of the Magna Carta in particular, as marking a positive step in the constitutional development of England, despite the flaws of the king himself.395 Winston Churchill, for example, argued that &quot;[w]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns&quot;.396
In the 1940s, new interpretations of John's reign began to emerge, based on research into the record evidence of his reign, such as pipe rolls, charters, court documents and similar primary records. This was epitomised by an essay by Vivian Galbraith in 1945, proposing a &quot;new approach&quot; to understanding the ruler.397 The increased use of record evidence was combined with an increased scepticism about two of the most colourful chroniclers of John's reign, Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris.398 In many cases the detail provided by these chroniclers, both writing after John's death, was challenged by modern historians.399 Interpretations of the Magna Carta and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been significantly revised: although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, in the context of John's reign most historians now consider it a failed peace agreement between &quot;partisan&quot; factions.400 There has also been increasing debate about the nature of John's Irish policies. Specialists in Irish medieval history, such as Sean Duffy, have challenged the conventional narrative established by Lewis Warren, suggesting that Ireland was less stable by 1216 than was previously supposed.401
Most historians today, including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but that his failings were exaggerated by 12th and 13th-century chroniclers.402 Jim Bradbury notes the consensus of contemporary historians that John was a &quot;hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general&quot;, albeit it, as Turner suggests, with &quot;distasteful, even dangerous personality traits&quot;, including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.403 John Gillingham, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren; Bradbury, again takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.404 Popular historian Frank McLynn maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, however, arguing that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is &quot;bizarre&quot;, and that as a monarch John &quot;fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set&quot;.405
Popular representations
 Popular representations of John first began to emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time.406 The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the king as a &quot;proto-Protestant martyr&quot;, similar to that shown in John Bale's morality play Kynge Johan, in which John attempts to save England from the &quot;evil agents of the Roman Church&quot;.407 By contrast, Shakespeare's play King John, whilst drawing on The Troublesome Reign for its source material and still relatively anti-Catholic, offers a more &quot;balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler&quot;.408 Anthony Munday's play The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington similarly portrays many of John's negative traits, but fundamentally adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic church, in line with the contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs.409 By the middle of the 17th century, however, plays such as Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda, although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour.410
19th-century fictional depictions of John were heavily influenced by Sir Walter Scott's historical romance, Ivanhoe, which presented &quot;an almost totally unfavourable picture&quot; of the king, drawing both on Victorian histories of the period and on Shakespeare's play.411 Scott's work influenced the late 19th-century children's writer Howard Pyle's book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, which in turn established John as the principal villain within the traditional Robin Hood narrative set, during the Third Crusade of the early 1190s.412 During the 20th century, John was normally depicted in fictional books and films alongside Robin Hood. Sam De Grasse's role as John in the black and white 1922 film version shows John committing numerous atrocities and acts of torture.413 Claude Rains played John in the 1938 colour version alongside Errol Flynn, starting a trend for films to depict John as an &quot;effeminate... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home&quot;.414 The character of John acts either to highlight the virtues of King Richard, or contrasts with the Sheriff of Nottingham, who is usually the &quot;swashbuckling villain&quot; to Robin.415 An extreme version of this trend can be seen in the Disney cartoon version, for example, which depicts John, voiced by Peter Ustinov, as a &quot;cowardly, thumbsucking lion&quot;.416 Popular works that depict John beyond the Robin Hood legends, such as James Goldman's play and later film, The Lion in Winter, set in 1183, still commonly present him as an &quot;effete weakling&quot;, in this instance contrasted with the more masculine Henry II.417
