Macules
A macule is a change in skin color, without elevation or depression and, therefore, nonpalpable, well or ill-defined1, variously sized but, by convention, less than one centimeter in diameter at the widest point.2 This skin lesion is recognizable due to the color difference compared with the surrounding normal skin3, and may be of any color, white, blue, or red for example.4 Diseases of the skin that present with maculae include vitiligo, melasma, and junctional nevi.5
