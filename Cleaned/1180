Margrit Biever Mondavi is Vice President of Cultural Affairs at Robert Mondavi Winery. A pioneering woman of the modern-day California wine industry, she joined the winery in 1967, pursuing a life-long interest in uniting wine with fine arts, music and culinary artistry. Under her direction, Robert Mondavi Winery developed original cultural and culinary arts programs that are now benchmarks for the wine world.&quot;She created a showplace for painters, sculptors, photographers, jazz and classical musicians and the great chefs and winemakers of the world,&quot; said Robert G. Mondavi.
Childhood in Switzerland
A native of Appenzell, Switzerland, Margrit was raised in her family home overlooking Lake Maggiore, in the canton of Ticino. Margrit&lt;U+2019&gt;s aesthetic nature was nurtured by parents with a passion for opera and symphonic music, good wine and fine food.
Once or twice a year, her family took the train to Milan for an evening of opera at La Scala. Her mother was a fine cook and avid gardener, and her father kept a treasured wine cellar.
'' &lt;U+201C&gt;My father gave my brother, sister and me an appreciation of just the right Beaujolais or Fendant, telling us stories
about the wine regions and vintages. He made wine something special,&lt;U+201D&gt;'' said Margrit.
She studied art at Minusio, an art school in Switzerland, under a professor who had been a student of Hans Hoffman.
Working at the Mondavi Winery
When Margrit started working at Robert Mondavi Winery, there were very few visitors frequenting Napa Valley.
''&lt;U+201C&gt;I had a dream to show wine with art, music and food,&lt;U+201D&gt; said Margrit, who is a working artist.
&lt;U+201C&gt;We began modestly, with a Sunday art show under the arches, accompanied by wine and food.&lt;U+201D&gt;
'' Gradually, the fine arts program evolved to the stature it holds today, with Margrit encouraging talented unknown artists
and supporting established ones such as Richard Diebenkorn, Wayne Thiebaud and Nathan Oliveira.
Margrit Founded the Mondavi Winery's Summer Music Festival
Margrit founded the winery&lt;U+2019&gt;s popular Summer Music Festival in 1969 as a benefit for the Napa Valley Symphony. This concert series has hosted some of the world&lt;U+2019&gt;s most recognized jazz, R&amp;B and pop artists. Headliners have included Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte and Tony Bennett. The Mondavi Summer Jazz Festival always opens with the famed New Orleans Jazz Band Preservation Hall. &lt;U+201C&gt;I am very proud we have contributed to the success of the Napa Valley Symphony through our annual donation,&lt;U+201D&gt; said Margrit. &lt;U+201C&gt;Now this beautiful valley has a beautiful symphony.&lt;U+201D&gt;
Winter Classical Concert at the Mondavi Winery
In 1984, the Festival of Winter Classical Concert Series was created, with the proceeds benefiting local musical organizations like the Napa Valley Opera. Together with Veronica di Rosa, Margrit and a small group of other dedicated Napa Valley art lovers formed a board of directors to rebuild the original 19th-century opera house in the city of Napa. She organized fundraising events, including art auctions, to keep the opera house alive. In 1998, the opera raised significant funds for the restoration as part of a challenge grant from Margrit and Robert Mondavi; the renovated opera house opened in October 2002.
Margrit Introduced Cooking Classes at the Mondavi Winery
After ten years at the winery, Margrit introduced a program of cooking classes to develop guests&lt;U+2019&gt; appreciation of great food paired with fine wine. She introduced the Great Chefs of France and the Great Chefs of America programs&lt;U+2014&gt;internationally respected culinary series that are now known simply as Great Chefs at Robert Mondavi Winery.
'''&lt;U+201C&gt;Like painting and music, wine and food speak to the heart,&lt;U+201D&gt; '''said Margrit.  '''&lt;U+201C&gt;By honoring the world of the senses, of memory and emotions, the rites of the table express our humanity.&lt;U+201D&gt; ''' The respect for California wines that has resulted from this program, especially among European chefs like Paul Bocuse and Jean Troisgros, give Margrit a great sense of pride.
