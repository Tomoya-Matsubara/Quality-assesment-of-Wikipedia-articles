The Strait of Hormuz  lang-ar  Madq Hurmuz,lang-fa  Tangeh-ye Hormoz is a narrow, strategically important waterway between the Gulf of Oman in the southeast and the Persian Gulf.  On the north coast is Iran and on the south coast is the United Arab Emirates and Musandam, an exclave of Oman.
The strait at its narrowest is convert 54 km nmi wide.cite web  url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Strait_of_Hormuz  title=The Encyclopedia of Earth  publisher=National Council for Science and Environment, eoearth.org It is the only sea passage to the open ocean for large areas of the petroleum-exporting Persian Gulf. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an average of about 15 tankers carrying 16.5 to 17 million barrels of  crude oil normally pass through the strait every day, making it one of the world's most strategically important choke points. This represents 40% of the world's seaborne oil shipments, and 20% of all world shipments.http://www.eia.doe.gov/cabs/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints/Hormuz.html World Oil Transit Chokepoints: Strait of Hormuz, eia.doe.gov
Navigation
Ships moving through the Strait follow a Traffic Separation Scheme TSS, which separates inbound from outbound traffic to reduce the risk of collision. The traffic lane is six miles 10&nbsp;km wide, including two two-mile 3&nbsp;km-wide traffic lanes, one inbound and one outbound, separated by a two-mile 3&nbsp;km wide separation median.
To traverse the Strait, ships pass through the territorial waters of Iran and Oman under the transit passage provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Although not all countries have ratified the convention,cite web  url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm  title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements as at 26 October 2007  publisher=UN  work=Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea most countries, including the U.S.,Cite document url=http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/58381.pdf format=PDF title=Presidential Proclamation 5030 author=U.S. President Ronald Reagan date=March 10, 1983 accessdate=2008-01-21 publisher=United States Department of State postscript= accept these customary navigation rules as codified in the Convention.
Oman has a radar site LQI to monitor the TSS in the strait of Hormuz. This site is located on a small island on the peak of Mussandam Peninsula.
Etymology
The opening to the Persian Gulf was described, but not given a name, in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a 1st-century mariner's guide:
:Ch.35. At the upper end of these Calaei islands is a range of mountains called Calon, and there follows not far beyond, the mouth of the Persian Gulf, where there is much diving for the pearl-mussel. To the left of the straits are great mountains called Asabon, and to the right there rises in full view another round and high mountain called Semiramis; between them the passage across the strait is about six hundred stadia; beyond which that very great and broad sea, the Persian Gulf, reaches far into the interior. At the upper end of this gulf there is a market-town designated by law called Apologus, situated near Charaex Spasini and the River Euphrates.
There are two opinions about the etymology of this name. In popular belief the derivation is from the name of the Persian God Hormoz a variant of Ahura Mazda. Compare the Pillars of Hercules at the entrance to the Mediterranean. Scholars, historians and linguists derive the name Ormuz from the local Persian language Persian word  Hur-mogh meaning date palm. In the local dialects of Hurmoz and Minab this strait is still called Hurmogh and has the aforementioned meaning.
Events
Operation Praying Mantis
Main Operation Praying Mantis
On 18 April 1988, the U.S. Navy waged a one-day battle against Iranian forces in and around the strait. The battle, dubbed Operation Praying Mantis by the U.S. side, was launched in retaliation for the 14 April mining of the USS Samuel B. Roberts FFG-58 USS Samuel B. Roberts FFG-58. U.S. forces sank one frigate, one gunboat, and as many as six armed speedboats in the engagement and seriously damaged a second frigate.
The downing of Iran Air 655
Main Iran Air Flight 655
On July 3, 1988, 290 people were killed when an Iran Air Airbus A300 passenger jet was shot down over the strait by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes CG-49 USS Vincennes. There is still a Iran Air Flight 655 lingering controversy about the event, a tragedy in aviation history.
Collision between USS Newport News and tanker Mogamigawa
On January 10, 2007, the nuclear submarine USS Newport News SSN-750 USS Newport News, traveling submerged, struck M/V Mogamigawa, a 300,000-ton Japanese-flagged very large crude Petroleum tanker#Merchant tankers tanker, south of the strait.cite web  url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/205951  title=Navy says speed of tanker sucked submarine up to surface  publisher=The Virginian Pilot  date=10 January 2007  author=Jack Dorsey

main 2008 US-Iranian naval dispute
A series of naval stand-offs between Iranian speedboats and U.S. warships in the Strait of Hormuz occurred in December 2007 and January 2008. U.S. officials accused Iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels; Iranian officials denied these allegations. On January 14, 2008, U.S. naval officials appeared to contradict the Pentagon version of the Jan. 16 event, in which U.S. officials said U.S. vessels were near to firing on approaching Iranian boats. The Navy's regional commander, Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, said the Iranians had neither anti-ship missiles nor torpedoes and that he wouldn't characterize the posture of the US 5th Fleet as afraid of these small boats.cite web  url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JA10Ak05.html  title=

=Iranian threats=
On June 29, 2008, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Ali Mohammed Jafari, said that if Iran were attacked by Israel or the United States, it would seal off the Strait of Hormuz, to wreak havoc in oil markets.  This statement followed other more ambiguous threats from Iran's oil minister and other government officials that a Western attack on Iran would result in turmoil in oil supply.
In response, Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff, commander of the U.S. 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain across the Persian Gulf from Iran, warned that such an action by Iran would be considered an act of war, and that the U.S. would not allow Iran to effectively hold hostage nearly a third of the world's oil supply.cite web  url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,374905,00.html title=

On July 8, 2008, Ali Shirazi, a mid-level clerical aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted by the student news agency ISNA as saying to Revolutionary Guards, The Zionist regime is pressuring White House officials to attack Iran. If they commit such a stupidity, Tel Aviv and U.S. shipping in the Persian Gulf will be Iran's first targets and they will be burned.cite web  url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080708/wl_nm/iran_nuclear_dc_8 title=Iran to hit Tel Aviv, U.S. ships if attacked publisher=Yahoo News  date=8 July 2008
An article in International Security contended that Iran could seal off or impede traffic in the Strait for a month, and an attempt by the U.S. to reopen it would likely escalate the conflict. http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18409/closing_time.html Closing Time: Assessing the Iranian Threat to the Strait of Hormuz, by Caitlin Talmadge, International Security, Harvard Kennedy School In a later issue, however, the journal published a response which questioned some key assumptions and suggested a much shorter timeline for re-opening.http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/isec.2009.33.3.190 Costs and Difficulties of Blocking the Strait of Hormuz, International Security, Winter 2008/2009

As of August 11, 2008, more than 40 U.S. and allied ships reportedly were en route to the Straits of Hormuz. One U.S. carrier battle group from Japan would complement two more, which are already in the Persian Gulf, for a total of five battle groups, not counting submarines.cite web  url=http://www.debka.com/headline.php?hid=5499  title = Three major US naval strike forces due this week in Persian Gulf publisher=Debkafile date=11 August 2008
