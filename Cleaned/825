Production
Production of Skyfall was suspended throughout 2010 because of MGM's financial troubles. They resumed pre-production following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010, and in January 2011 the film was officially given a release date of 9 November 2012 by MGM and the Broccoli family, with production scheduled to start in late 2011. Since then, MGM and Sony Pictures announced that the UK and Ireland release date would be brought forward to 26 October 2012, two weeks ahead of the US release date, which remains 9 November 2012.25 The film's budget is estimated to be at $150 million,26 down from the $200 million spent on Quantum of Solace.
The film is to be part of yearlong celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Dr. No and the Bond franchise. According to producer Michael G. Wilson, a documentary crew is scheduled to follow production of the film to celebrate the anniversary.27
Filming began on 7 November 2011.2829
Title
In August 2011, several news websites reposted a rumour that originally appeared in Serbian newspaper Blic stating that Bond 23 would be entitled Carte Blanche and would be an adaptation of the recent continuation novel by Jeffery Deaver.30 On 30 August, Eon Productions officially denied any link between Bond 23 and Carte Blanche, stating that &quot;the new film is not going to be called Carte Blanche and will have nothing to do with the Jeffery Deaver book.&quot;31
On 3 October 2011, fifteen domain names including 'jamesbond-skyfall.com' and 'skyfallthefilm.com' were reported to have been registered on behalf of MGM and Sony Pictures by internet brand-protection service MarkMonitor. This led to supposition in media that the film had been given the name &quot;Skyfall&quot;. These reports were not confirmed at the time by Eon Productions, Sony or MGM.32
Skyfall was later confirmed as the title at the November press conference, during which co-producer Barbara Broccoli said that the title &quot;has some emotional context which will be revealed in the film&quot;.33
Crew
Skyfall is directed by Sam Mendes, who first signed on to the project shortly after Quantum of Solace was released, and remained on-board as a &quot;consultant&quot; during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Speculation in the media34 suggested that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to &quot;[remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'&quot; with the intention of bidding for an Academy Award.35 Mendes denied the reports, stating that the film's planned action scenes were an important part of the overall film.36
Peter Morgan was originally commissioned to write a script, but left the project when MGM filed for bankruptcy and production of the film stalled; despite his departure, Morgan later stated that the final script was based on his original idea, retaining what he described as the film's &quot;big hook&quot;.37 The final script was written by Bond screenwriting regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as John Logan.383940 Logan recounted being brought into the project by his long-time friend Sam Mendes, describing the process between Mendes and the writers as &quot;very collaborative&quot;, and that writing Skyfall was one of the best experiences he had had in writing a film.41
Roger Deakins has signed on as cinematographer, having previously worked with Mendes on Jarhead and Revolutionary Road.42 Thomas Newman, who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for American Beauty, Jarhead and Revolutionary Road will replace David Arnold as composer.43 Arnold commented that that Newman had been selected by Mendes because of their work together, rather than because of Arnold's commitment to working with director Danny Boyle as composer for the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics.44 Dennis Gassner returns as production designer, the costume designer is Jany Temime, Alexander Witt is director of the second unit, the stunt co-ordinator is Gary Powell and Chris Corbould will supervise the special effects, while the visual effects supervisor is Steve Begg. All have worked on previous Bond films.45
Locations
Sam Mendes and Barbara Broccoli travelled to South Africa for location scouting in April 2011.46 With the film moving into pre-production in August, reports emerged that shooting would take place in India,47 with scenes to be shot in the Sarojini Nagar district of New Delhi48 and on railway lines between Goa and Ahmedabad.49 The production crew faced complications in securing permission to close sections of the Konkan Railway.50 Similar problems in obtaining filming permits were encountered by production crews for The Dark Knight Rises and Mission: Impossible &lt;U+2013&gt; Ghost Protocol.51 Permission was eventually granted to the Bond production crew, with some additional restrictions put in place at the request of the Indian authorities;52 however, it was later reported that the production crew had elected not to shoot in India.53 Further reports emerged stating that filming would take place in Istanbul's Sultanahmet Square54, the Hagia Sophia museum, the city of Fethiye and the Varda railway bridge near Adana,55 with production expected to spend three months in the country.56
Mendes confirmed that China will be featured in the film, with shooting scheduled to take place in Shanghai and &quot;other parts&quot; of the country.57 Additional scenes were filmed at Royal Ascot, standing in for Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Shooting was planned to take place at Duntrune Castle in Argyll, Scotland for the finale,58 but was cancelled shortly after filming began.59
Shooting began in and around London,6061 with scenes shot in Southwark and Whitehall, the National Gallery,62 Smithfield meat markets and St Bartholomew's Hospital,63 Canary Wharf,64 the Department of Energy and Climate Change,65 Charing Cross station and the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich.66 Photos taken by residents in the city's Deptford district revealed the presence of an Aston Martin DB5 on location.67
