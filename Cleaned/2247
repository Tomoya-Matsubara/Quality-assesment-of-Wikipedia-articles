Nightrage is a Greek/Swedish melodic death metal band formed by guitarist Marios Iliopoulos (ex-Exhumation) and his close friend Gus G. who later re-located to Gothenburg, Sweden.
History
Their first release, Sweet Vengeance, was released in 2003 and featured drummer Per M&lt;U+00F6&gt;ller Jensen (The Haunted), and bassist Brice Leclercq. They also managed to acquire the services of vocalist Tomas Lindberg (ex-At the Gates). Sweet Vengeance also featured guest clean vocals on a few tracks by Tom S. Englund of Evergrey fame. The album is proceeded by their first ever video for the track &quot;Gloomy Daydreams&quot; on an earlier edit, with Gus G. on Vocals.
Their second release, Descent into Chaos, was released in 2005 and had a change of line up, with the addition of a more permanent rhythm section. Fotis Benardo (Septic Flesh, ex-Innerwish) took over on drums and Henric Carlsson, who also plays in the band Cipher System, on bass. Mikael Stanne, of Dark Tranquillity, provided a clean vocal section on the track &quot;Frozen.&quot;
On July 10, 2005, it was announced that Tomas Lindberg had decided to leave the band due to difficulty working his role in the band around his various other projects. Replacing him on vocals was the relatively unknown Jimmie Strimell.
When Gus G. was performing with Arch Enemy at 2005's Ozzfest, he was replaced by Pierre Lysell for Nightrage's touring activities. For some of Nightrage's tour in support of Bolt Thrower, Gus was again unavailable and his place was taken by Christian Muenzer, of Necrophagist.1 In March 2006, Gus permanently left Nightrage to focus completely on Firewind. At this time Fotis Benardo decided also to leave Nightrage and focus on the reunited Septic Flesh.
Their third release, A New Disease Is Born, was released in 2007 and once again had a line up change; Fotis Benardo was replaced by Alex Svenningson on the drums. Gus G was also replaced by the well known Swedish guitar virtuoso Olof M&lt;U+00F6&gt;rck (Dragonland, Avalanche, My Darling). The album's name may have been originated from lyrics from the song &quot;Drug&quot; on their last release. The album showcases their second video for the song &quot;Scathing&quot;, directed by Bob Katsionis.
After the release of A New Disease Is Born Alex Svenningson and Jimmie Strimell left the band to pursue a carrier in pop music. Long time bassist Henric Karlsson also left the band due to his family obligations.
Replacing them were three very familiar faces in the underground metal world. Vocalist Antony H&lt;U+00E4&gt;m&lt;U+00E4&gt;l&lt;U+00E4&gt;inen (Burn Your Halo), bassist Anders Hammer (Dragonland), and drummer Johan Nunez (Suicide of Demons].
On September 20th, 2008 Nightrage announced the title of their upcoming new album, Wearing A Martyr's Crown. The album is said to be a return to form for the band, with an even more traditional melodic death metal approach. It was confirmed on November 4th, 2008 that Wearing A Martyr's Crown will be recorded, produced, and mixed by Fredrik Nordstr&lt;U+00F6&gt;m at Studio Fredman.
