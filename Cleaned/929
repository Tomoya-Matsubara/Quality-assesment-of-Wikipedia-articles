ALMA MATER
Hail Montezuma

In the spirit of the Aztec name.

A tribute raise of lasting praise and steadfast faith,
Hail Montezuma.
Hail Montezuma
We salute thy glorious destiny:
Far seeing in company days,
Men and women strong who live in truth.
To thee, San Diego
And the Black and Scarlet we'll be true
An echo comes from Aztec drums through all the years,
Hail Montezuma!
FIGHT SONG
Fight on and on ye Aztec men,
Sons of Montezuma,
We will win again,
Keep your spirits high,
Never bow a knee,
We will fight till victory.
Fight on and on ye Aztec men,
Proudly raise your banners high,
For it's the Red and Black,
Hail to our team,
San Diego Aztecs fight!
