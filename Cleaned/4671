The Kinzua Bridge or the Kinzua Viaduct ( or ) was a railroad trestle that had spanned Kinzua Creek in McKean County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The bridge was  tall and  long prior to its collapse.
The bridge was originally built from iron in 1882 and was billed as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;, holding the record as the tallest railroad bridge in the world for two years. In 1900 the bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains. It stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to the state government of Pennsylvania in 1963, becoming the centerpiece of a state park. Restoration of the bridge began in 2002, but before it was finished, a tornado struck the bridge in 2003 causing a large portion of the bridge to collapse. Contributing to the collapse was the failure, caused by corrosion, of the anchor bolts holding the bridge towers to their foundations.
Before its collapse, the Kinzua Bridge was ranked as the fourth tallest railway bridge in the United States.1 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1982. The Kinzua Bridge is in Kinzua Bridge State Park off of U.S. Route 6 near the borough of Mount Jewett, Pennsylvania.
Construction
In 1882, Thomas L. Kane, president of the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railway (NYLE&amp;W), was faced with the challenge of building a branch line off the main line in Pennsylvania, from Bradford south to the coal fields in Elk County.23 The fastest way to do so was to build a bridge to cross the Kinzua Valley. The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional  of track over rough terrain.4 When built, the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted, and over twice as large as the largest similar structure: the Portage Bridge over the Genesee River in upstate New York.5
The first Kinzua Bridge was built by a crew of 40 from  of wrought iron in just 94 working days, between May 10 and August 29, 1882.678 The reason for the short construction time was that scaffolding was not used in the bridge's construction; instead a gin pole was used to build the first tower, then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building the second tower.910 The process was then repeated across all 20 towers.11  The bridge was designed by the engineer Octave Chanute and was built by the Phoenix Iron Works, which specialized in producing patented, hollow iron tubes called &quot;Phoenix columns&quot;.12 Because of the design of these columns, it was often mistakenly believed that the bridge had been built out of wooden poles.13 The bridge's 110 sandstone masonry piers were quarried from the hillside used for the foundation of the bridge.1415 The tallest tower had a base that was  wide.16 The bridge was designed to support a load of ,17 and cost $167,000 (or $ in  dollars).1819
On completion, it was the tallest and longest railroad bridge in the world and was advertised as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;.2021 Six of the bridge's 20 towers were taller than the Brooklyn Bridge.22 Excursion trains from as far away as Buffalo, New York, and Pittsburgh would come just to cross the Kinzua Bridge,23 which held the height record until the Garabit Viaduct,  tall, was completed in France in 1884.24 Trains crossing the bridge were restricted to a speed of  because the locomotive, and sometimes the wind, caused the bridge to vibrate.25 People sometimes visit the bridge in hopes of finding the loot of a bank robber, who supposedly hid $40,000 in gold and currency under or near it.2627
Reconstruction and use
In 1893 the NYLE&amp;W went bankrupt and was merged with the Erie Railroad, which became the owner of the bridge.28 By the start of the 20th century locomotives were almost 85 percent heavier, and the iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains.29 The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24. Construction on the new steel bridge began on May 26, starting from both ends. Two Howe Truss &quot;timber travelers&quot;, each  long and  deep, were used to build the new bridge.30 Each traveler was supported by two of the original towers on the opposite sides of a third original tower that was to be demolished. After the middle tower had been removed, construction of a new steel replacement tower and the spans adjoining it took one week. Then the traveler would move, and the next tower would be taken down and replaced.31  The new bridge was designed by C.R. Grimm and was built by the Elmira Bridge Company out of  of steel.32 A crew of between 100 and 150 worked 10-hour days for four months to complete the steel frame by September 6, and the bridge reopened to traffic on September 25, 1900.3334 Once rebuilt, the $275,000 bridge was able to safely accommodate one of the largest steam locomotives in the world, the  Big Boy.3536 The bolts used to hold the towers to the anchor blocks were reused from the first bridge, a move which eventually played a major role in the bridge's demise. Some of the anchor bolts were also extended using tap bolts and threaded sleeves.37 Grimm later admitted that the bolts should have been replaced.38
Train crews would sometimes play a trick on a brakeman on his first journey on the line. When the train was a short distance from the bridge, the crew would send the brakeman over the rooftops of the cars to check on a small supposed problem. As the train crossed the bridge, the rookie &quot;suddenly found himself terrified, staring down three hundred feet [91 m] from the roof of a rocking boxcar&quot;.39 Even after being reconstructed the bridge still had a speed limit of . As the bridge aged, heavy trains pulled by two steam locomotives had to stop so the engines could cross the bridge one at a time. Diesel locomotives were lighter and did not face this limit; the bridge was last used by a steam engine on October 5, 1950.40
The Erie Railroad obtained trackage rights on the nearby Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) line in the late 1950s, which allowed it to bypass the aging Kinzua Bridge. Regular commercial service ended on June 21, 1959, and the Erie sold the bridge to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of Indiana, Pennsylvania, for $76,000.41 The bridge was reopened for one day in October 1959 when a wreck on the B&amp;O line forced trains to be rerouted across the bridge.42 According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Kinzua Bridge &quot;was a critical structure in facilitating the transport of coal from Northwestern Pennsylvania to the Eastern Great Lakes region, and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth.&quot;43
State park
 Nick Kovalchick, the owner of the salvage company, could not bear to dismantle the bridge. On seeing it for the first time he is supposed to have said &quot;There will never be another bridge like this.&quot;44 Kovalchick worked with local groups who wanted to save the structure, and Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton signed a bill into law on August 12, 1963, to purchase the bridge and nearby land for $50,000 and create Kinzua Bridge State Park.4546 The deed for the park's  was recorded on January 20, 1965, and the park was opened to the public in 1970.47
An access road to the park was built in 1974, and new facilities there included a parking lot, drinking water and toilets, and installation of a fence on the bridge deck.48 There was an official ribbon cutting ceremony on July 5, 1975, for the park, which &quot;was and is unique in the park system&quot; since &quot;its centerpiece is a man-made structure&quot;.49 The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 29, 1977,50 and was named to the National Register of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks on June 26, 1982.51
The Knox and Kane Railroad (KKRR) operated sightseeing trips from Kane through the Allegheny National Forest and over the Kinzua Bridge from 1987 until the bridge was closed in 2002.52 In 1988 it operated the longest steam train excursion in the United States, a  round trip to the bridge from the village of Marienville, with a stop in Kane. The New York Times described being on the bridge as &quot;more akin to ballooning than railroading&quot; and noted &quot;You stare straight out with nothing between you and an immense sea of verdure a hundred yards [91 m] below.&quot;53 The railroad still operated excursions through the forest and stopped at the bridge's western approach until October 2004.54
As of 2009, Kinzua Bridge State Park is a  Pennsylvania state park surrounding the bridge and the Kinzua Valley. The park is located off of U.S. Route 6 north of Mount Jewett in Hamlin and Keating Townships. A scenic overlook within the park allows views of the fallen bridge and of the valley, and is also a prime location to view the fall foliage during the first two weeks of October. The park has a shaded picnic area with a centrally located modern restroom.55 Prior to the bridge's collapse, visitors were allowed on or under the bridge and hiking was allowed in the valley around the bridge.56 In September 2002 the bridge was closed even to pedestrian traffic.57 About  of Kinzua Bridge State Park are open to hunting. Common game species are turkey, bear and deer.58
Destruction
 On July 21, 2003, a tornado struck the Kinzua Bridge, snapping and uprooting nearby trees, as well as causing 11 of the 20 bridge towers to collapse. The tornado was produced by a mesoscale convective system (MCS), a complex of strong thunderstorms, that had formed over an area that included eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, western New York, and southern Ontario.59 The MCS traveled east at around . As the MCS crossed northwestern Pennsylvania, it formed into a distinctive comma shape (something that usually happens after the formation of a bow echo). The northern portion of the MCS contained a &quot;long–lived&quot; mesocyclone, and while mesocyclones are not often associated with tornadic activity, they can sometimes produce tornadoes.60
At approximately 15:20 EDT (20:20 UTC), the tornado touched down in Kinzua Bridge State Park,  from the Kinzua Bridge. The tornado, classified as F1 on the Fujita scale, passed by the bridge and continued another  before it lifted. It touched down again  from Smethport and traveled another  before finally dissipating. It was estimated to have been  wide and it left a path  long.61 The same storm also spawned an F3 tornado in nearby Potter County.62
Since 2002, the Kinzua Bridge had been closed to all &quot;recreational pedestrian and railroad usage&quot; after it was determined that the structure was at risk to high winds.63 Engineers had determined that during high winds, the bridge's center of gravity would shift, putting weight onto only one side of the bridge and causing it to fail.64 An Ohio-based bridge construction and repair company had already started work on restoring the Kinzua Bridge in February 2003.65 In fact, the workers had already packed up and were starting to leave for the day when the storm came.66
When the tornado touched down, the winds had increased to at least  and were coming from the east, perpendicular to the bridge, which ran north-south. An investigation determined that Towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first, in a westerly direction.67 Meanwhile, Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations, moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright, held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge. Next towers 4 through 9 collapsed to the west, twisting clockwise, as the tornado started to move northward.68 As it moved north, inflow winds came in from the south and caused Towers 12, 13, and 14 to finally collapse towards the north, twisting counterclockwise.69
The failures were caused by the badly rusted base bolts holding the bases of the towers to concrete anchor blocks embedded into the ground.70 An investigation determined that the tornado had a wind speed of at least , which applied an estimated  of lateral force on to the bridge.71 The investigation also hypothesized that the whole structure oscillated laterally 4 to 5 times before fatigue started to cause the base bolts to fail. The towers fell intact in sections and suffered damage upon impact with the ground.72 The tornado took less than 30 seconds to destroy the bridge which had stood for over a century.73
Aftermath
The state decided not to rebuild the Kinzua Bridge, which would have cost an estimated $45 million. Instead, the ruins are intended to become a visitor attraction used to show the forces of nature at work.74 Kinzua Bridge State Park had attracted 215,000 visitors annually before the bridge collapsed,75 and was one of twenty-one state parks chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of &quot;Twenty Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks&quot;.76 The viaduct and its collapse were featured in the History Channel's Life After People as an example of how corrosion and high winds would eventually lead to the collapse of any steel structure.77 The bridge was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on July 21, 2004.78
The Knox and Kane Railroad was forced to suspend operations in October 2004 after a 75 percent decline in the number of passengers, brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge.79 The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and any other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before it was sold to the state in 1963.80 The company plans to remove the tracks and sell them for scrap. The right-of-way would then be used to establish a rail trail.81
Pennsylvania released $700,000 to design repairs on the remaining towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005.82 In late 2005, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) put forward an $8 million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors' center, with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers.83 In 2009, the DCNR announced a $5 million plan to construct an octagonal observation platform with a glass bottom at the end of the southern part of the bridge. The platform would be situated  above the valley floor and allow views directly below the platform, as well as of the bridge ruins and the three remaining northern towers. The plans include a new visitors' center and work to strengthen the six remaining southern towers. Bids for the project would be sought in April 2009.84
