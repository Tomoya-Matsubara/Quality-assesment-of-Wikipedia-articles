The Prince George's County Sheriff's Office (PGSO) provides law enforcement services in Prince George's County, Maryland in the United States. Its headquarters is located in Upper Marlboro. The Sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer of Prince George's County and is elected by the citizens every four years. 1
Created in 1696, the traditional duties of the Sheriff are keeper of the public peace and the enforcement arm of the county court, analogous to the US Marshal Service. The PGSO has a relatively long history embedded within Maryland and the United States. The PGSO was involved with events that occurred during the burning of Washington and affected the writing of the United States National Anthem. Prior to 1931, the PGSO was the sole law enforcement organization within the county.
Today, general law enforcement of the county is provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's County Police Department, though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies, is a progressive agency with an array of services from a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk warrants and barricade situations to Community Services aiding the county citizens in safety education.
Authority
The Sheriff of Prince George's County is the chief law enforcement official of Prince George's County per Maryland common law.2 All deputy sheriffs are certified, sworn law enforcement officials with full power of arrest as granted by the Constitution of Maryland, the MPCTC, and the Sheriff of Prince George's County.3
History
The Sheriff's Office for Prince George's County was founded April 22, 1696. The governor of Maryland, Sir Francis Nicholson appointed Thomas Greenfield as the first Sheriff. The St. Paul's Church in Charlestown held the headquarters for the Sheriff's Office until the 1720s when it was relocated to the town of Upper Marlboro. At the time, there was no set salary for the sheriff. Instead, he was paid in hog's head of tobacco. The headquarters for the sheriff's office was held in Upper Marlboro until 2000, when the sitting Sheriff, Al Black, moved it to Largo where it resided until August 2008 when the current sheriff returned the office headquarters to Upper Marlboro where it is currently located.4

War of 1812
 During the War of 1812, at the time of the Burning of Washington, the Sheriff's Office became involved in an occurrence that ultimately led to the writing of the United States national anthem. As the British army marched from Washington they passed through Prince George's County. Because the residents had cooperated with the British, the commander ensured that minimal damage was inflicted upon the local residents and their property. After the Battle of Bladensburg, the British army returned to the area of Upper Marlboro. However, this time some of the British soldiers looted local farms. A Sheriff's Posse subsequently arrested the offending soldiers and placed them in the county jail. Upon learning about the arrest of his soldiers, the British commander ordered the arrest of the Sheriff and the posse in turn. One of the posse members was Dr. William Beam. Beam was ultimately arrested and held for ranson on a British warship. Beam's brother-in-law, Francis Scott Key went to Baltimore Harbor in search of him. He witnessed the British fleet under attack which was the inspiration of the Star Spangled Banner.5
2002: Deputies killed in the line of duty
On August 29, 2002, Sgt. James Arnaud and Deputy First Class Elizabeth Magruder were killed in the line of duty while trying to serve an Emergency Petition Service (EPS, a court-ordered psychological evaluation) to James R. Logan.6 At around 9:30 pm, Cpl. Arnaud and Deputy Magruder were at the residence of James Logan in Adelphi, MD. While attempting to serve a petition for a psychiatric evaluation, Logan suddenly fled to a back bedroom. When Arnaud and Magruder chased after him, Logan fired at the deputies. Arnaud was shot in the neck and Magruder was shot in the back of the head. Logan fled the scene and was apprehended two days later by undercover officers. Logan was initially tried and convicted in 2003. Two years later in 2005, the decision was overturned on appeal and Logan attended a second trial. Logan was subsequently convicted again and sentenced to 30 years. Arnaud was posthumously promoted to Sergeant. Magruder was posthumously promoted to Deputy First Class.78
2008: Deputy wounded in Laurel
On February 16, 2008 at approximately 3:30 am, a PGSO SWAT member was shot and critically wounded while serving a warrant as part of a task force with the US Marshals. The suspect, Aaron M. Lowry, was wanted for the shooting of a Washington, DC Police Officer from the day prior. The injured deputy was flown to Baltimore Shock Trauma Center where he had surgery and was upgraded to serious but stable condition.9
2008: SWAT raid of Berwyn Heights Mayor
On July 29, 2008, a SWAT Team from the Sheriff's Office, executing a search warrant and assisting the separate County Police, conducted a raid on the home of Berwyn Heights Mayor Cheye Calvo. The raid was initiated after the Mayor brought a package into his home delivered by the SWAT team. A drug-sniffing dog had determined that the package&lt;U+2014&gt;addressed to the Mayor's wife&lt;U+2014&gt;contained 32 pounds of marijuana. While taking control of the residence, Sheriff's deputies shot Calvo's two pet Labrador retrievers, including one who was alleged by Calvo to be running away from officers.10 Calvo and his mother-in-law were handcuffed and questioned for several hours, with Calvo wearing just underwear.11
Police Chief High stated his department did not know the home was owned by the mayor and his wife.12 During the interrogation, Calvo repeatedly requested to see the search warrant, but his lawyer stated no copy was provided until three days later. Calvo stated that officers did not believe he was the Mayor and for a time refused his request that they contact the Berwyn Heights Police Department (which was unaware of the raid) to confirm his identity.13 A County Police spokesman initially stated that a no-knock warrant had been issued for Calvo's home. However, after Calvo's lawyer challenged that statement and media published copies of the warrant, the commander of the county's narcotics enforcement division stated that no-knock warrants do not exist in the county. Newspapers cited legal experts who stated that a 2005 Maryland law created no-knock warrants.14 The incident received wide coverage in the United States1516 and abroad.1718
Prince George's County Police later arrested two men in a drug trafficking plan involving the shipment of large parcels of marijuana to addresses of uninvolved residents. After each parcel was delivered outside the addressee's home, another individual would retrieve the drugs. Police seized six packages containing 417 pounds of marijuana.19 The Sheriff's Office and County Police have stated that the Berwyn Heights raid was proper because of the large quantity of drugs involved.20
On August 7, 2008 Mayor Calvo called for a federal investigation of the incident by the United States Department of Justice.21 On August 8th, Calvo and his wife were cleared by County Police of any wrongdoing.22. The local chapter of the NAACP also requested an investigation.23 In early August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began a civil rights investigation into the incident.24
