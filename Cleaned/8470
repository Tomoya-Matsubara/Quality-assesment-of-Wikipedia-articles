Artists from Poland, including famous composers like Chopin or Penderecki and traditional, regionalized folk musicians, create a lively and diverse music scene, which even recognizes its own music genres, such as poezja &lt;U+015B&gt;piewana and disco polo. As of 2006, Poland is one of the few countries in Europe where rock and hip hop dominate over pop music, while all kinds of alternative music genres are encouraged.
Beginnings
The origin of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century, from which manuscripts have been found in Stary S&lt;U+0105&gt;cz, containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of Bogurodzica, may also date back to this period. The first known notable composer, however, Mikolaj z Radomia, lived in the 15th century.
During the 16th century, mostly two musical groups - both based in Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w and belonging to the King and Archbishop of Wawel - led the rapid innovation of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include Wac&lt;U+0142&gt;aw z Szamotu&lt;U+0142&gt;, Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;aj Ziele&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, and Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;aj Gomo&lt;U+0142&gt;ka. Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Zygmunt III Vasa, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.
17th and 18th centuries
In the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of Sigismund III and W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw IV. These included Luca Marenzio, Giovanni Francesco Anerio, and Marco Scacchi. Polish composers from this period focused on baroque religious music, concertos for voices, instruments, and basso continuo, a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The most well-remembered composer of this period was Adam Jarz&lt;U+0119&gt;bski, known for his instrumental works such as Chromatica, Tamburetta, Sentinella, Bentrovata, and Nova Casa. Other composers include Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki, Franciszek Lilius, Bart&lt;U+0142&gt;omiej P&lt;U+0119&gt;kiel, Stanis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Sylwester Szarzy&lt;U+0144&gt;ski and Marcin Mielczewski.
In addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of Galatea (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy. Shortly after this performance, the court produced Francesca Caccini's opera La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d&lt;U+2019&gt;Alcina, which she had written for Prince W&lt;U+0142&gt;adis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw three years earlier when he was in Italy. Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman. When W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw was king (as W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art. The composers of these operas are not known: they may have been Poles working under Marco Scacchi in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw.
The late 17th and 18th century saw a decline of Poland, which also hindered the development of music. Some composers attempted to create a Polish opera (such as Jan Stefani and Maciej Kamie&lt;U+0144&gt;ski), others imitated foreign composers such as Haydn and Mozart.
The most important development in this time, however, was the polonaise, perhaps the first distinctively Polish art music. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by Micha&lt;U+0142&gt; Kleofas Ogi&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, Karol Kurpi&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, Juliusz Zar&lt;U+0119&gt;bski, Henryk Wieniawski, Mieczys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Kar&lt;U+0142&gt;owicz, J&lt;U+00F3&gt;zef Elsner, and, most famously, Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric Chopin. Chopin remains very well-known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including mazurkas, nocturnes, waltzes and concertos, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces. The same period saw Stanis&lt;U+0142&gt;aw Moniuszko, the leading individual in the successful development of Polish opera, still renowned for operas like Halka and The Haunted Manor.
Traditional music
Polish folk music was collected in the 19th century by Oskar Kolberg, as part of a wave of Polish national revival. With the coming of the world wars and then the Communist state, folk traditions were oppressed or subsumed into state-approved folk ensembles. The most famous of the state ensembles are Mazowsze and &lt;U+015A&gt;l&lt;U+0105&gt;sk, both of which still perform. Though these bands had a regional touch to their output, the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of Polish styles. There were more authentic state-supported groups, such as S&lt;U+0142&gt;owianki, but the Communist sanitized image of folk music made the whole field seem unhip to young audiences, and many traditions dwindled rapidly.
Dance music
Polish dance music, especially the mazurka and polonaise, were popularized by Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere. These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the polka and krakowiak come from the south. The polonaise comes from the French word for Polish to identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy, who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called chodzony. The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of Polish music.
Podhale
Main article: Music of Podhale
While folk music has largely died out in Poland, especially in urban areas, the tourist destination of Podhale has retained its traditions. The regional capital, Zakopane, has been a center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer Karol Szymanowski, who discovered Goral folk music there, made the area chic among Europe's intellectuals. Though a part of Poland, Podhale's musical life is more closely related to that found in the Carpathian mountains of Ukraine and Transylvania.
Local ensembles use string instruments like violins and a cello to play a distinctive scale called the Lydian mode. The distinctive singing style used in this scale is called lidyzowanie. The lead violin (prym) are accompanied by several second violins (sekund) and a three-stringed cello (bazy). Duple-time dances like the krzesany, zb&lt;U+00F3&gt;jnicki (Brigand's Dances) and ozwodna are popular. The ozwodna has a five bar melodic structure which is quite unusual. The krzesany is an extremely swift dance, while the zb&lt;U+00F3&gt;jnicki is well-known and is perceived as being most &quot;typical&quot; of Podhale. Folk songs typically focus on heroes like Janosik.
Other regions
Outside of Podhale, few regions have active folk scenes, though there are music festivals, such as the Kazimierz Festival, which are well-known and popular. Regional folk bands include Gienek Wilczek Band (Bukowina), Tadeusz Jedynak Band (Przystalowice Male), Stachy Band (Hazc&lt;U+00F3&gt;w nad Wislokiem), Franciszek Gola Band (Kadzid&lt;U+0142&gt;o), Edward Markocki Band (Zmysl&lt;U+00F3&gt;wka-Podlesie), Kazimierz Kantor Band (G&lt;U+0142&gt;owaczowa), Swarni Band (Nowy Targ), Kazimierz Meto Band (Glina), Ludwik M&lt;U+0142&gt;ynarczyk Band (Lipnica) and Trebunie-Tutki (Poronin).
Classical music
During the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the polonaise, and produced such composers as Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric Chopin. Poland was then a center for musical development before declining. Karol Szymanowski soon gained prominence, however, and, like Chopin, included elements of Polish traditional music in his works. He was the most well-known Polish composer prior to World War I. Between the wars, a group of composers formed the Association of Young Polish Musicians; these included Gra&lt;U+017C&gt;yna Bacewicz, Zygmunt Mycielski, Micha&lt;U+0142&gt; Spisak and Tadeusz Szeligowski.
Following World War II, some composers, such as Roman Palester and Andrzej Panufnik, fled the country and remained in the exile. In the early 1960s, however, a number of composers known as the Polish composer's school arose, characterized by the use of sonorism and dodecaphonism. The style emerged out of the political crisis in 1956, following Stalin's death; that same year saw the Warsaw Autumn music festival inaugurated, from whence came additional popularity for the Polish composer's school. Composers included Tadeusz Baird, Boguslaw Schaeffer, W&lt;U+0142&gt;odzimierz Koto&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, Witold Szalonek, Krzysztof Penderecki, Witold Lutos&lt;U+0142&gt;awski, Wojciech Kilar, Kazimierz Serocki and Henryk Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;aj G&lt;U+00F3&gt;recki.
More modern composers include Krzysztof Meyer, Pawe&lt;U+0142&gt; Szyma&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, Wojciech Kilar, Henryk Miko&lt;U+0142&gt;aj G&lt;U+00F3&gt;recki, Krzesimir D&lt;U+0119&gt;bski, Hanna Kulenty, Eugeniusz Knapik and Jan A. P. Kaczmarek.
Contemporary music
Poland has always been a very open country to new music genres and even before the fall of the communism music styles like rock, metal, jazz, electronic, and New Wave were well-known. Since 1989, the Polish scene has exploded with new talents and a more diverse style. Contrary to most European countries, pop music is not dominant in Poland. It is completely overshadowed by rock and, to a lesser degree, by hip hop. Alternative music styles, such as black metal, gothic rock, trip hop, EBM, and post-rock, are also popular.
Poland has also two indigenous styles of popular music: sung poetry and disco polo. The latter is completely ignored by the mainstream media, while the former has its own radio stations and TV channels.
Poland is a huge producer of hip hop music, which is usually most popular in large urban centres. Rock is usually more dominant in smaller cities and rural areas, but rock radio stations are by far the most listened to radio stations in Poland. Every year, a huge gathering of young Poles meet to celebrate the rock and alternative music in Jarocin or &lt;U+017B&gt;ary. These events often attract more than 250,000 people and are comparable to the gatherings in Woodstock and Roskilde.
Poland has a very active underground Extreme Metal Music Scene. Some of the bands that have heralded and helped the cause are Vader, Behemoth, Yattering, Decapitated, Graveland and Dissenter. This has paved ground for a large underground movement. One of the biggest record labels of death metal in Poland is Empire Records.
