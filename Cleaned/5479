&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah (954 &lt;U+2013&gt; 19 April 1012; , &quot;elf-high&quot;), officially remembered by the name Alphege within the Church, and also called Elphege, Alfege, or Godwine, was an Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Winchester, later Archbishop of Canterbury. He became an anchorite before being elected abbot of Bath Abbey. His perceived piety and sanctity led to his promotion to the episcopate, and eventually, to his becoming archbishop. &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah furthered the cult of St Dunstan and also encouraged learning. He was captured by Viking raiders in 1011 and killed by them the following year after refusing to allow himself to be ransomed. &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah was canonized as a saint in 1078. Thomas Becket, a later Archbishop of Canterbury, prayed to him just before his own murder in Canterbury Cathedral.
Life
Reportedly born in Weston on the outskirts of Bath,1 &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah became a monk early in life. He first entered the monastery of Deerhurst, but then moved to Bath, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become abbot of Bath Abbey.2 Probably due to the influence of Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury (959&lt;U+2013&gt;988), &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah was elected Bishop of Winchester in 984,34 and was consecrated on 19 October that year.5 While bishop he was largely responsible for the construction of a large organ in the cathedral, audible from over a mile away and said to require more than 24 men to operate. He also built and enlarged the city's churches,6 and promoted the cult of St Swithun and Swithun's predecessor, &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelwold of Winchester.7
Following a Viking raid in 994, a peace treaty was agreed with one of the raiders, Olaf Tryggvason. Besides receiving danegeld, Olaf converted to Christianity8 and undertook never to raid or fight the English again.9 &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah may have played a part in the treaty negotiations, and it is certain that he confirmed Olaf in his new faith.10
In 1006 &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah succeeded &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfric as Archbishop of Canterbury,1112 taking St Swithun's head with him as a relic for the new location.13 He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium&lt;U+2014&gt;symbol of his ties to the Apostolic See&lt;U+2014&gt;from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey.1415 While at Canterbury he promoted the cult of St Dunstan,16 ordering the writing of the second Life of Dunstan, which Adelard composed between 1006 and 1011.17 He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.18
&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah sent &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfric of Eynsham to Cerne Abbey to take charge of its monastic school.19 He was present at the council of May 1008 at which Wulfstan II, Archbishop of York, preached his Sermo Lupi ad Anglos (The Sermon of the Wolf to the English), castigating the English for their moral failings and blaming the latter for the tribulations afflicting the country.20
In 1011 the Danes again raided England, and from 8&lt;U+2013&gt;29 September they laid siege to Canterbury. Aided by the treachery of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfmaer, whose life &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah had once saved, the raiders succeeded in sacking the city.21{{#tag:ref|How exactly &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah had saved &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfmaer's life is not recorded in any source.22|group=notes}} &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah was taken prisoner and held captive for seven months.23 Godwine (Bishop of Rochester), Leofrun (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's reeve, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfweard were captured also, but the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfmaer, managed to escape.24 Canterbury Cathedral was plundered and burned by the Danes following &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's capture.25
Death
&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah refused to allow a ransom to be paid for his freedom, and as a result was killed on 19 April 1012 at Greenwich26 (then in Kent, now London), reputedly on the site of St Alfege's Church.2728 The account of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's death appears in the E version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle:  on the Saturday in the octave of Easter, and then pelted him there with bones and the heads of cattle; and one of them struck him on the head with the butt of an axe, so that with the blow he sank down and his holy blood fell on the earth, and sent forth his holy soul to God's kingdom.29}}
&lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to die a violent death.30 A contemporary report tells that Thorkell the Tall attempted to save &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah from the mob about to kill him by offering them everything he owned except for his ship, in exchange for &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's life; Thorkell's presence is not mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, however.31 Some sources record that the final blow, with the back of an axe, was delivered as an act of kindness by a Christian convert known as &quot;Thrum.&quot; &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah was buried in St Paul's Cathedral.32 In 1023 his body was moved by King Canute to Canterbury, with great ceremony.33 Thorkell the Tall was appalled at the brutality of his fellow raiders, and switched sides to the English king &lt;U+00C6&gt;thelred the Unready following &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's death.34
Veneration
 Pope Gregory VII canonized St &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah in 1078, with a feast day of 19 April.35 Lanfranc, the first post-conquest Norman archbishop, was dubious about some of the saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's sanctity,36 but &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah and Augustine of Canterbury were the only pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's calendar of saints.37 &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early twelfth century under Anselm of Canterbury, who was instrumental in retaining &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's name in the church calendar.3839 After the 1174 fire in Canterbury Cathedral, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's remains together with those of Saint Dunstan were placed around the High Altar, at which Thomas Becket is said to have commended his life into &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom.40 The new shrine was sealed in lead,41 and was north of the High Altar, sharing the honour with St. Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the High Altar.42 An incised paving slab to the north of the present High Altar marks the spot where the medieval shrine is believed to have stood.43 A Life of St. Alphege in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named Osbern, at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but the Life is very much a hagiography: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.44
In the late medieval period, &lt;U+00C6&gt;lfheah's feast day was celebrated in Scandinavia, perhaps because of the saint's connection with Cnut.45 In 1929 a new church in Bath was dedicated to Saint Alphege, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott in homage to the ancient Roman church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.46
