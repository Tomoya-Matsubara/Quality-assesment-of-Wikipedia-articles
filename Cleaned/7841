The following is a list of known surviving veterans of the First World War (July 28, 1914 &lt;U+2013&gt; November 11, 1918). The total number of participating personnel is unknown, but there were an estimated nine million military casualties during the conflict.
Veterans, for this purpose, are defined as people who were members of the armed forces of one of the combatant nations up to and including the date of the Armistice. Other WWI-era veterans are listed separately. This policy may vary from the policy in actual use in some countries.
111 year-old British WWI veteran Henry Allingham, born June 6, 1896, is currently the oldest living verified veteran. Emiliano Mercado del Toro of Puerto Rico (August 21, 1891 &lt;U+2013&gt; January 24, 2007), who died aged 115, is the oldest authenticated veteran, from any conflict, to have ever lived.
