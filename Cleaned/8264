Sir William Bruce of Kinross, 1st Baronet (c.1630 – 1 January 1710) was a Scottish gentleman-architect, &quot;the effective founder of classical architecture in Scotland&quot;, Howard Colvin observes1 He was a key figure in introducing the Palladian style into Scotland, and has been compared to the pioneering English architects Inigo Jones and2 and the contemporaneous English introducers of French style in domestic architecture Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt.3
Bruce played a role in the Restoration of Charles II, carrying messages between the exiled king and General Monck, and was rewarded with lucrative official appointments, including that of Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland, effectively the &quot;king's architect&quot;. His patrons included John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, the most powerful man in Scotland at the time, and Bruce rose to become a member of parliament, and briefly sat on the Scottish Privy Council.
Despite his lack of technical expertise, Bruce became the most prominent &quot;gentleman-architect&quot; of his time in Scotland. He worked with competent masons and professional builders, to whom he imparted a classical vocabulary; thus his influence was carried far beyond his own aristocratic circle. Beginning in the 1660s he built and remodelled a number of country houses, including Thirlestane Castle for the Duke of Lauderdale, and Hopetoun House. Among his most significant work was his own Palladian mansion at Kinross, built on the Loch Leven estate which he had purchased in 1675. As the king's architect he undertook the rebuilding of the Royal Palace of Holyroodhouse in the 1670s, which gave the palace its present appearance. After the death of Charles II, Bruce lost political favour, and later following the accession of William and Mary, he was imprisoned more than once as a suspected Jacobite. However, he managed to continue his architectural work, often providing his services to others with Jacobite sympathies.

Little is known of Bruce's youth. He was probably born at Blairhall in western Fife, in around 1630, the second son of Robert Bruce of Blairhall and Katherine Preston. The Bruces were a well-connected Episcopalian family, strongly loyal to the king, and descended from a cousin of King Robert The Bruce, Thomas Bruce, who had been granted lands in Clackmannan and Fife.4
Bruce first came to note when he acted as a negotiator between General Monck and the exiled King Charles II. A passport survives, issued to Bruce by Monck in September 1659, and giving him permission to &quot;returne to Holland&quot;,5 and it appears that the messages he brought back from the exiled Charles persuaded Monck to march his army to London, a decisive event in the Restoration.6 It is not known how Bruce came to be acquainted with Monck, or the nature of their communications. Hubert Fenwick speculates that Bruce was employed on Monck's fortification projects at Ayr and Leith, as it is known that he was working at Ayr Citadel in the early 1660s.7 Sir Robert Douglas stated that Bruce &quot;painted the distress and distractions&quot; of Scotland before the General, and suggested to him &quot;the glory that would be acquired in restoring the royal family&quot;.8
Political career
Following the restoration, William Bruce was appointed Clerk of the Bills in 1660,9 and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament in the first case, and from petitioners to the Court of Session in the latter. In 1667 he was appointed Superintendent and Overseer of the Royal Palaces in Scotland, and the following year was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia. He was made Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland in 1671, with a salary of &lt;U+00A3&gt;3600 Scots (&lt;U+00A3&gt;300 Sterling), for the purpose of rebuilding Holyroodhouse.10 As a key figure of the Restoration, he became close to other Stuart loyalists, who included such powerful patrons as the Duke of Lauderdale, Secretary for Scotland, and the Earl of Rothes, whose daughter married Bruce's only son.11.
From 1669 to 1674 Bruce sat in the Scottish Parliament as shire commissioner for Fife, and from 1681 to 1682 as a shire commissioner for Kinross.12 From April 1685 to May 1686 he reached the peak of his political career, as a member of the Privy Council of Scotland.13 Bruce's earnings from these posts allowed him to purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and in 1675 the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, the latter giving him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire.14 However, following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime.15 After the Revolution of 1688, he refused to take up his seat in Parliament, and was considered a potential Jacobite threat.16
In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle, for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle.17 Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce, who voted for the Union, and went on to sit at Westminster. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.18 He was buried in the family plot at Kinross Kirk, the ruins of which still stand beside Kinross House.19
Family
Around 1660 William Bruce married Mary Halket, daughter of James Halket of Pitfirrane. They had two surviving children, John and Anne. After Mary's death, Bruce married Magdalen Scott, widow of an Edinburgh merchant called George Clerk, in 1700. Magdalen lived until 1752, and gained a reputation as a Jacobite, establishing a Jacobite cell at her home in Leith Citadel. 20
His son John Bruce (before 1671 – 19 March 1710) married Christian Leslie, widow of the Marquess of Montrose and daughter of the Duke of Rothes, and inherited the baronetcy on his father's death. Following his own death shortly after, the baronetcy became extinct, and the Kinross estate passed to Anne Bruce, who married Sir Thomas Hope, 4th Bt.21
Architectural works
 In 1663 Bruce made a &quot;foreign journey&quot;22 Whether by visit or through studying engravings he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Bl&lt;U+00E9&gt;rancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating the latest innovations such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were highly influential on the young Bruce.23 He had also certainly seen modern Dutch architecture when in Holland prior to the Restoration.24
Much of Bruce's early work involved advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason John Mylne, who had left plans for both houses. Bruce oversaw the works at both after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments, particularly at Leslie. Panmure House was demolished in the 1950s, and only a small part of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century.25 Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.26
 Bruce also worked on his own property at Balcaskie, Fife, which he bought in 1665, and which does survive intact, although with later alterations. He doubled the L-plan house to a symmetrical U-plan, and may have built the curving wing-walls and linking pavilions. Gifford, however, attributes these to a later building phase.27 The curving walls, a form later seen at Hopetoun, were a new innovation if Bruce did carry them out, possibly inspired by the work of the Italian Gian Lorenzo Bernini.28 In the gardens he laid out French-inspired terrace parterres, with a vista leading the eye to the Bass Rock, all inspired by French baroque gardens such as Vaux-le-Vicomte.29 Internally, Bruce created a new layout of rooms, and it was for his continental-inspired internal planning, as much as his exterior design, that he was sought after as an architect.30
In 1670 the Duke of Lauderdale commissioned Bruce to remodel Thirlestane Castle, his sixteenth-century tower house in the Border country. Bruce, working with King's master mason Robert Mylne, extended the building with new corner pavilions and a new entrance, and re-planned the interior. Lauderdale continued to employ Bruce during the 1670s, on his homes at Brunstane near Edinburgh, and Lethington (later renamed Lennoxlove), as well as commissioning a design for new gates at his English property, Ham House, near London, in 1671. At Ham Bruce may have had further involvement with the remodelling works going on there, under the direction of the English architect William Samwell.31 While engaged at Thirlestane, Bruce also designed the nearby Lauder Kirk, his only complete ecclesiastical project. This cruciform-plan church may have been inspired by Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois Mansart's similar church at Balleroy in France.32

Holyroodhouse
His appointment as Surveyor General of the King's Works in Scotland was made with the intention of rebuilding the palace of Holyroodhouse. Aside from this project, he only carried out minor repairs to Edinburgh and Stirling Castles, and to the fortifications on the Bass Rock.33 Charles I had intended to extend and rebuild Holyroodhouse, and plans had been drawn up in the 1630s. Nothing was done however, and in 1650 the palace was burnt out, destroying all but the west range. Bruce was contracted to design and oversee the works, with Robert Mylne acting as contractor. Bruce's plans were drawn up by Mylne, as Bruce himself apparently lacked the technical skills of architectural drawing.34
Charles II criticised Bruce's initial plans for the internal layout, and an improved scheme was eventually approved. Construction began in July 1671, and by 1674 much of the work was complete. Bruce built a second gothic tower to mirror the existing one built by James IV, and created the courtyard block in a more restrained classical style.35 A second phase of work started in 1676, when the Duke of Lauderdale ordered Bruce to demolish and rebuild the main west fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade, resulting in the main entrance which is seen today.36
Also in 1676, Bruce drew up plans for the completion of Heriot's Hospital in Edinburgh, which had been started in the 1620s. His design, for the central tower of the south fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade, was eventually executed in 1693.37

Country houses
His first commission for a new building was Dunkeld House, and came from the Earl of Atholl in 1676.38 The house had been badly damaged in 1654, during the civil war, and Bruce was given the task of building its replacement. (The house was later demolished). Another early full-scale commission was for Moncrieffe House (1679), which burned down in the 1950s.39 His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with French-derived detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun.40
In 1675 Bruce bought the estate of Loch Leven from the Earl of Morton. The estate included an old manor near Kinross, as well as the ruins of Loch Leven Castle, famous as the jail of Mary, Queen of Scots. After carrying out repairs on the old manor, and beginning to lay out the gardens, Bruce began work on his new home, Kinross House, in 1686, employing master mason Thomas Bauchop. The Palladian building bears some resemblance to Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 (demolished), but with French-inspired features such as the rusticated basement stonework, and the giant order of corinthian pilasters, the latter possibly deriving from Bernini's first designs for the Louvre.41 Following Bruce's fall from favour, he found himself increasingly in debt, which delayed the completion of the house until 1693. 42 Kinross was one of the earliest Palladian-style country houses in Scotland, and was recognised as one of the finest buildings in the country. Daniel Defoe described it as &quot;the most beautiful and regular piece of Architecture in Scotland&quot;, and Thomas Pennant called Kinross &quot;the first good house of regular architecture in North Britain&quot;.43

Later work
Despite Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Craighall in Fife, and Craigiehall near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th century remodelling, carried out by William Adam.44 Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval &quot;squint&quot; giving a view of the pulpit.45
In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. This was built the following year, and now serves as an entertainment venue. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in 1706, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.46
Legacy
Although at Kinross Daniel Defoe called Bruce &quot;the Kit Wren of North Britain&quot;,47 for his role as the effective founder of classical architecture in that country, Gifford suggests he is more comparable to Hugh May and Roger Pratt in his achievements. Like May and Pratt, he popularised a style of country house amongst the nobility, and encouraged the move away from anachronistically defensive homes towards a more continental, leisure-oriented architecture.48 Sir John Clerk of Penicuik named Bruce as &quot;the chief introducer of architecture in this country&quot;,49 while to Colen Campbell, compiler of Vitruvius Britannicus, he was &quot;justly esteem'd the best Architect of his time in that Kingdom&quot;.50 His work was a major influence on the design of country houses in the 18th century, an influence which was spread through the masons and draughtsmen he worked with, including Mylne and Bauchop, James Smith, and Alexander Edward.51 In his consideration of house and garden together, his work also prefigured the picturesque movement of the later 18th century.52
