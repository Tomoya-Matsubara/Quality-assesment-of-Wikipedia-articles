is a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon species in Nintendo and Game Freak's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon franchise. Created by Ken Sugimori, Lucario first appeared in the video games Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl, also appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Lucario is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese, and Bill Rogers in English.
Known as the Aura Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon it can track energy called Aura, which is given off by all living creatures. It is featured on the boxart for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia, and has a staring role in the film Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. Lucario is also featured as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. IGN called its presence in Super Smash Bros. Brawl &quot;a bit on the head scratching side&quot;, although another editor stated that it would make sense for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to be represented by a fighting-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.
Concept and creation
The design and art direction for Lucario was provided by Ken Sugimori, a friend of the creator of the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon games, Satoshi Tajiri.1 The species first appeared in the Nintendo DS games, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl, released in Japan in 2006. In an interview, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl director Junichi Masuda noted Lucario's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.2
Lucario is a bipedal, jackal-like Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that is around four feet in height. Lucario's forepaws are black and have one white spike on each arm on the upper-side of its wrists. In addition, there is a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's snout and ears have also grown longer since its evolution from Riolu. Lucario also has a furry yellow torso, and its thighs are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and the one featured in the film is capable of telepathic human speech,3 similar to Legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon of past films. It can read the thoughts and movements of other beings by sensing the Aura that they emit.4 A trained Lucario is able to sense aura and identify the feelings of creatures up to half a mile away.5
Appearances
In the video games
Lucario is a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon that appears in the Nintendo DS versions of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl; The only way to obtain it is to get a Riolu egg from Riley on Iron Island, hatch the egg, and evolve Riolu. Lucario is used by Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, a tag-team partner known as Riley, and by Cynthia, Sinnoh's Elite Four Champion.6 In Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Mystery Dungeon Lucario is seen as the greatest rescue leader of all time, and his adventures have become legendary. After reaching a certain amount of points, a Lucario statue will be displayed outside the rescue base. While the player never meets Lucario, Alakazam tells the player that his goal is to become closer to Lucario's greatness.7
Lucario is featured as an unlockable playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Wii. It is unlocked by encountering it in The Subspace Emissary or through other special means.8 Lucario can use moves such as Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and his &quot;Final Smash&quot;, Aura Storm. When using its Final Smash, it launches a powerful Aura attack in which you have to change its angle.9 Lucario's fighting style revolves around Aura manipulation and the concept of &quot;high risk, high return&quot;; the more damage Lucario has taken, the stronger it and its attacks become. Lucario was confirmed to be a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl due to an unintentional leak. The leak, which took place on Nintendo's official smashbros.com, detailed that certain stickers could only be applied to certain characters*. The characters they made reference to were Jigglypuff and Lucario.10

In the anime
Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon movie, Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew. In the movie, Lucario is a servant to a nobleman named Sir Aaron in a Renaissance-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to manipulate aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's outset, Lucario begins questioning any Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon-human relationship. Lucario demonstrates an adeptness to Aura. The Lucario in the movie, voiced by Sean Schemmel, can also speak human languages without telepathy, the fifth speaking non-legendary Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon after Team Rocket's Meowth. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.11
Maylene, the third Sinnoh Gym Leader, has a Lucario and it was seen in four different episodes of the Diamond and Pearl: Battle Dimension series. It was first seen battling with Maylene in their training. Lucario used Aura Sphere to stop the battle of Electabuzz, Piplup, and Pikachu, and is seen battling Paul's Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon in a flashback.12 Lucario was seen again where it battled in Dawn's gym battle with Maylene, where it defeated Dawn's Ambipom and Piplup.13 Then, in the next episode, it battled in Ash's gym battle against Maylene. It defeated Ash's Staravia and Chimchar, but was knocked out along with Ash's Buizel, resulting in a tie.14 Finally, Lucario was seen when it helped Ash and the others defeat Saturn and Team Galactic.15
In other media
In the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Adventures manga, like in games, it appears under the ownership of Riley who was on a boat heading to the Battle Frontier.16 Diamond meets Riley at Iron Island, and Byron asks Riley to help Diamond sharpen his Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon battle skills before Diamond goes to Lake Verity.17 In Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Diamond and Pearl Adventure! the main character, Hareta, gained a Riolu egg which hatched into a Riolu later on in that chapter and then evolved into Lucario.
In the Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Trading Card Game there are currently many different packs that feature Lucario. He also has a card tin. Each Pokemon TCG Lucario Collector's Tin contains one (1) Foil Level X Lucario card as well as 4 booster packs from the Diamond &amp; Pearl series.18
Promotion and reception
UGO described Lucario as &quot;a new breed of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, with a cooler, more dangerous look. It's quick and possesses a damaging set of attacks&quot;, yet called it lame due to its status as a Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon.19 IGN called its presence in Super Smash Bros. Brawl &quot;a bit on the head scratching side&quot; in light of more familiar characters in the title such as Pikachu.20 Although another editor stated that it would make sense for Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon to be represented by a fighting-type Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon, since Super Smash Bros Brawl is a fighting game.21 GamesRadar described it as an &quot;all-around bad-ass&quot; and &quot;the Bruce Lee of Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon&quot;, suggesting its design as similar to the Egyptian God Anubis.2223 Beckett Pok&lt;U+00E9&gt;mon Unofficial Collector editor Sean Cooper stated that Lucario had grown popular in recent years due to his starring role in Lucario and the Mystery of Mew and his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.24
