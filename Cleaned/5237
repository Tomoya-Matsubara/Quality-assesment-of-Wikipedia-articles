 Tracy is a city in San Joaquin County, California, United States, and is a suburb of Stockton.
Geography and environment
Located in the Central Valley, Tracy sits atop fertile agricultural lands, which have come under increasing development pressure as the San Francisco Bay Area's vigorous population growth has spilled over into the Tracy area as well as other locations near the Bay Area's edge. Because of the historic use of DDT on area row crops, there are residual issues of soil contamination from this substance and related persistent chemicals.1 There is a historic area chloroform groundwater plume associated with Georgia Pacific operations in the area. Faults considered active in the Tracy area are the Black Butte Fault, Midway Fault and Carnegie Corral Fault.2 The San Joaquin Fault traverses the Tracy area and is a potential source of risk for seismic events.3

The Tracy High School football field and MVP trophy are named after Peter B. Kyne, a novelist from San Francisco whose Bohemian Club friends orchestrated the naming in 1927, even though Kyne had very little to do with Tracy.
Kathy Griffin recorded her CD &quot;Kathy Griffin: For Your Consideration&quot; live on February 17, 2008 at the ETK Theatre at the Grand Theatre Center for the Arts in Tracy.
The city gained notoriety in December, 2008 after a 16-year-old battered and emaciated boy - with shackled feet and wearing nothing but boxer shorts - escaped the Tracy home where he was being held prisoner by climbing over a sound wall to a nearby fitness center. Those accused of holding the boy prisoner and of torturing him were the married couple who lived in the home and the boy's former guardian, who was also staying in the home. All three were charged in Stockton with mass mayhem, kidnapping, and felony child abuse that could net them life sentences if they are found guilty; they are being held on $2.2 million bail each.
Tracy was the home of Sandra Cantu, a child who was murdered in the city sometime in March or April 2009. She was reported missing on March 27, 2009.
