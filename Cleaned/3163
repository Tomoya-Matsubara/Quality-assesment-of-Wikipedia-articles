Maynard James Keenan (born James Herbert Keenan on April 17, 1964) is an American rock singer, songwriter, musician, and producer. Although originally from Ohio, Keenan spent his high school and college years in Michigan. After serving in the Army in the early 1980s, he attended Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids. He relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1988 to pursue a career in interior design and set construction, and formed the band Tool with Adam Jones shortly thereafter.
Keenan is best known as the lead singer of the multi-platinum rock bands Tool and A Perfect Circle with whom he has released four and three studio albums, respectively. In 2003, he created Puscifer as a side project, financing and releasing its first studio album in October 2007. In addition to his music career, he has performed improvisational stand-up comedy inspired by close friend Bill Hicks and ventured into acting. His family has been involved in winemaking; he currently owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars in Arizona, where he resides. Among other business ventures, he is a partner in the Los Angeles restaurant Cobras &amp; Matadors. Since rising to fame, Keenan has been a noted recluse, although he does emerge to support charitable causes.
Early life
 James Keenan was born in Ravenna, Ohio on April 17 1964, the only child of Judith Marie and Michael Loren Keenan. When his parents divorced in 1968, his father, a high school teacher, moved to Michigan and Keenan would only see him about once a year for the next 12 years. His mother remarried, bringing Keenan into an &quot;intolerant and unworldly household&quot;, where his intelligence and creative expression would be stifled.1 When Keenan was 11, his mother suffered a paralyzing cerebral aneurysm, which would later serve as the inspiration for many of his creative works. Two years later, she persuaded Keenan to live with his father in Michigan.2
Inspired by Bill Murray's performance in the 1981 comedy film Stripes, Keenan joined the United States Army, with the intention of having the G.I. Bill fund his dream of attending art school.3 By this point, he had lived in Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas.4 He initially served in the Army as a forward observer before studying at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School (West Point Prep School) from 1983 to 1984. In addition to completing a rigorous math and English curriculum, he ran on the cross country running team and sang in the glee club.5 It was during his time in the military that he adopted the sobriquet &quot;Maynard&quot; on a whim.6 He was distinguished in basic and advanced training,7 but declined an appointment to West Point and instead chose to pursue a music career because of his disillusionment with his colleagues' values8 and because he knew West Point would not tolerate his dissidence. 9
Upon completing his term of enlistment, he studied art at Kendall College of Art and Design in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 1988, he relocated to Los Angeles where his love of animals led him to practice interior design for pet stores,10 before he was quickly fired and began working in set construction.11 During the 1980s, Keenan played bass guitar for TexA.N.S. and sang for Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty, both independent bands.12
Career
Tool
After moving to Los Angeles, Keenan met Adam Jones, who had heard him singing on a demo in college, and Jones suggested that they form a band. Although reluctant at first,13 Keenan agreed and, in 1990, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included guitarist Jones, his neighbor, drummer Danny Carey, and bassist Paul D'Amour, who would later be replaced by Justin Chancellor.14
Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment in November 1991 and released the Opiate EP the following year. To support this release, the band toured with Fishbone and Rage Against the Machine. During a 1993 show at the Church of Scientology&lt;U+2019&gt;s Celebrity Centre in Los Angeles, Keenan, (who would later write the lyrics &quot;Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones&quot;), baa-ed like a sheep for a good portion of the show. &quot;Before our set this guy tries to intimidate me by showing me a gun in his jacket,&quot; Keenan recalled. &quot;I explained to him that if he pissed me off I&lt;U+2019&gt;d start a riot.&quot;15 Shortly thereafter, Tool released their 1993 debut album, Undertow, in the United States, where it was certified gold after just eight months, and platinum less than a year later.16 In 1994, the band released their single &quot;Prison Sex&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a song in which Keenan opted to deliver in a slight grunge-style&lt;U+2014&gt;with a corresponding music video created and directed by Jones. The video was deemed &quot;too graphic and offensive&quot;,17 and was withdrawn by MTV after a few airings due to &quot;a symbolic dealing with the sensitive subject of child abuse&quot;.18
In October 1996, the band released their second studio album, &lt;U+00C6&gt;nima, which was certified gold in 10 weeks and achieved double platinum in 10 months.19 The Metal Observer reviewed the album stating, &quot;Knowing what is around the corner is rarely guessed correctly and the band focus brutality with melody in equal measure. Tool&lt;U+2019&gt;s music shouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t fit and it doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t as Maynard spills forth discontenting imagery through his incisive dissonant lyrics.&quot;20 In 1998, &quot;&lt;U+00C6&gt;nema&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.21 After the release of the album, Tool began a prolonged legal battle with their label Volcano Records (formerly Zoo Records) over alleged contract violations. Following this legal battle, which resulted in a new three record deal,22 the members of Tool decided to take some time off. During the hiatus, the band members were outspokenly critical of filesharing networks, due to the negative financial impact on artists dependent on success in record sales. During an interview with NY Rock in 2000, Keenan stated, &quot;I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs.&quot;23  Five years after the release of &lt;U+00C6&gt;nima, Tool announced a new album, Systema Enc&lt;U+00E9&gt;phale, with a 12-song tracklist in January 2001.24 A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled Lateralus and that the name Systema Enc&lt;U+00E9&gt;phale and the tracklist had been a ruse.25 Known for his &quot;dark, intelligent, compelling, and unexpected lyrical twists&quot;,26 Keenan was acclaimed for his songwriting on the album, in which he &quot;doesn&lt;U+2019&gt;t cross the line from darkness to ugliness ... as often as he has in the past&quot;.27 In an interview with NY Rock, Keenan explained, &quot;Everything we release with Tool is inspired by our music. It doesn't matter if it is a video or if it's lyrics. The lyrics for &quot;Schism&quot; are nothing more than my interpretation of the music.&quot;28 The album became a worldwide success, reaching #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 albums chart in its debut week,29 and Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song &quot;Schism&quot;.30
Fifteen years after the band's formation, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of Revolver described as a devoted &quot;cult&quot; following,31 and in May 2006, the band released 10,000 Days, an album in which Keenan sang about more personal issues, in contrast to previous attempts to inspire change.32 His mother is the inspiration for two tracks on the album; the two-part song &quot;Wings for Marie&quot; and &quot;10,000 Days&quot;,33 which deals with her death after 27 years, or around 10,000 days, of suffering.3435 The album sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was #1 on the Billboard 200 charts.36 However, 10,000 Days was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor Lateralus had been.3738
A Perfect Circle
During Tool's post-&lt;U+00C6&gt;nima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the &lt;U+00C6&gt;nima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery).39 Both albums were eventually certified platinum. They followed up in 2004 with the release of eMOTIVe, an album composed of covers except the singles &quot;Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums&quot;&lt;U+2014&gt;a song inspired by &quot;Pet&quot; that was originally released on Thirteenth Step&lt;U+2014&gt;and &quot;Passive&quot;. Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he &quot;tested the waters&quot; and was subsequently &quot;crucified&quot; for it because of the content.40 It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMotion, which was certified platinum within a month of its release.
Although highly successful, the future of A Perfect Circle remains uncertain. It is currently on hiatus, partly due to Keenan's commitments to Tool, and Howerdel reporting in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being.41 After more than two years since the bands last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated:
Puscifer
In 2003, Keenan surfaced under the name &quot;Puscifer&quot; for the song &quot;REV 22:20&quot; on the Underworld film soundtrack. Puscifer is a cover name for non-Tool related work with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails. In 2006, Puscifer would contribute the song &quot;The Undertaker (Renholder Mix)&quot; to the soundtrack of Underworld: Evolution, where &quot;Renholder&quot;, a moniker for Danny Lohner created by the members of A Perfect Circle, is the reversal of &quot;Re: D Lohner&quot;.4243 Keenan has stated that it is &quot;a premiere improvisational hardcore band&quot;,44 and his &quot;catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc.&quot; project.45 When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his &quot;attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good.&quot;46 In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said that he did not want the lyrics to be puzzles, He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating &quot;that's the part that gets under your skin and makes you feel good.&quot;47
Keenan financed and released the first studio album, &quot;V&quot; Is for Vagina, in October 2007.48 The album was a radical departure from Keenan's contributions in Tool and A Perfect Circle, and was criticized as unfocused and lacking in the passion and intelligence present in his previous work.4950 Keenan's limited vocal range and underwhelming lyrics&lt;U+2014&gt;which ranged from depressing and esoteric to shallow and childish&lt;U+2014&gt;were singled out as particularly disappointing.5152
Writing and performance style
A primary purpose of Keenan's lyrics for Tool involves a desire to connect with the listeners on a personal level; to encourage them to look within themselves for self-identity, understanding and reflection.53 Tool does not include lyrics with any releases as Keenan believes most people &quot;don't get it&quot; and it is not a priority of the band that people do.54 However, after each release Keenan has eventually published his typed lyrics online via the semi-official fansite, with the exception of &quot;Lateralus&quot;, which was published on the official Tool website.55 Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in the lyrics to &quot;Lateralus&quot;, wherein the number of syllables per line correspond to an arrangement of the Fibonacci numbers,56 and &quot;Jambi&quot;, in which the metrical foot iamb is used.57 Keenan's lyrics on &lt;U+00C6&gt;nima and Lateralus focused on philosophy and spirituality&lt;U+2014&gt;specific subjects range from organized religion in &quot;Opiate&quot;, to evolution and Jungian psychology in &quot;Forty-Six &amp; 2&quot; and transcendence in &quot;Lateralus&quot;.58
In live performances with Tool, Keenan has been known to be situated on a platform towards the rear of the stage,59 without a spotlight,60 facing the backdrop rather than the audience.Keenan's unusual stage positioning is discussed at the following:
His vocals are mixed in low volume.6162 With Tool, his appearance has included the Mohawk hairstyle,63 wigs, Kabuki masks, bras, tights,64 and his entire body in blue paint.6566 This is contrasted with a long dark wig with A Perfect Circle.6768 His posture on stage is usually bent.69
Describing Keenan's contribution to Tool and A Perfect Circle, The New York Times wrote that &quot;both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity&quot;.70 Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been lauded by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: after his performance during an Alice in Chains reunion concert in 2005, freelance journalist Travis Hay saw him as &quot;a natural fit at replacing Layne Staley&quot;.71 His unique style of singing has often been considered influential to artists such as Pete Loeffler of Chevelle.7273
Comedy
Keenan became friends with comedian Bill Hicks in the early 1990s. Keenan did stand-up comedy on improv nights in comedy clubs in Los Angeles during that time.74 The two became acquainted and Hicks later opened some Tool concerts. Best known is a routine Hicks did while on tour with Tool during the Lollapalooza tour in 1993, when he asked the audience to look for a contact lens he had lost. Keenan enjoyed this joke so much that he repeated it on a number of occasions.
Keenan is featured in several segments of Mr. Show,75 most notably in the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs. Later in the sketch he is featured wearing a wig as the lead singer of the then-fictitious band &quot;Puscifer&quot;. When asked about the arrest of Dobbs, Keenan replies &quot;Guilty? Yeah. I'm sure he's guilty but... he knows it. I mean, you're guilty, and you don't know it. So... who's really in jail?&quot; He also appears in episode 2.6, &quot;The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop&quot;, as one of the viewers of Coupon: The Movie, saying &quot;Now is not the time&quot;, waving the cameras off and slapping the microphone out of his face in disgust after walking out of the theater. Later, Keenan would sing on a track for the Mr. Show incarnation Run Ronnie Run,76 and appear in the &quot;music video sex scene&quot; on its DVD. Keenan's portrayal of Charles Manson on Mr. Show was described by critics as &quot;so intense and too real to not be upsetting&quot;.77 He also appeared as Satan in the 2002 film Bikini Bandits and its 2004 sequel Bikini Bandits 2: Golden Rod. When asked in an interview which role was more difficult, Keenan responded, &quot;Oh, Manson. He&lt;U+2019&gt;s a real person. People know what he looks like, how he talked. With Satan there&lt;U+2019&gt;s so much gray area.&quot;78
In the mid-90s, responding to requests for Tool to perform in benefit shows, Keenan created &quot;Free Frances Bean&quot; tee-shirts to represent his own platform. Frances' mother Courtney Love had previously referred to Keenan as a &quot;media whore&quot; to which he responded, &quot;Isn't that great? I have the distinction of being called a media whore by Courtney Love.&quot;79 He said that after watching &quot;the tornado that is her mother&quot;, he thought &quot;Oh my God, how is Frances Bean gonna survive this insanity?&quot;80 Although it was started as a simple joke, the tee-shirts were soon in high demand and Keenan was giving them away.81
On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced, as an April Fools' Day prank, that &quot;Maynard has found jesus&quot; and would be abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently.82 Kurt Loder of MTV contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan's response was simply &quot;heh heh&quot;.83 On April 7, the official site revealed that it was a hoax.84 During an interview Keenan later stated, &quot;It was April Fools&lt;U+2019&gt;. If you fall for that on April Fools&lt;U+2019&gt; Day, there&lt;U+2019&gt;s nothing I can do for you.&quot;85 He has been part of other April Fools' pranks related to Tool, including one in which he was said to be in critical condition after a tour bus accident.86
Personal life
 Keenan, who has described himself as &quot;happily unmarried&quot;,87 has a son named Devo H. Keenan (born August 5, 1995) who is the cellist for Ashes Divide, Billy Howerdel's post-A Perfect Circle project. It was after the birth of his son that it occurred to Keenan to obscure his identity in order to prevent his son from being &quot;victimized by [his] career&quot;.88 Keenan was engaged at one time, but the couple broke up. The song &quot;Bre&lt;U+00F1&gt;a&quot; by A Perfect Circle uses her middle name, while the single &quot;Judith&quot; bears the name of Keenan's mother, and Tool's &quot;H&quot; is the middle name of his son.89 Jiu-jitsu is one of Keenan's pursuits, having studied under Rickson Gracie, who is widely considered one of the martial art's greatest practitioners.90 In addition to being part-owner of Cobras &amp; Matadors, an LA restaurant,91 Keenan, whose family made wine in Northern Italy, owns Merkin Vineyards and Caduceus Cellars, based in the unincorporated area of Page Springs/Cornville, Arizona, southwest of Sedona, where he currently resides.92 While the winery is named after an ancient symbol for healing (caduceus), the vineyard is named after a pubic wig (merkin).93
Keenan has a reputation for being reclusive, elliptical and controlling of his public image,94 dislikes the manner in which rock stars are worshipped,95 and at one point carried business cards with the name &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot; printed on them.96 Keenan has used his voice on numerous occasions to support charitable causes. He performed at a 1997 benefit concert for RAINN (the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network) organized by Tori Amos (who had often referred to Keenan as an unofficial brother).97 In February 2005, Keenan appeared as a surprise vocalist at a Seattle benefit concert for victims of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami in southern Asia,98 performing with the partly reformed Alice in Chains in place of the deceased vocalist Layne Staley on the songs &quot;Them Bones&quot;, and &quot;Man in the Box&quot;.
