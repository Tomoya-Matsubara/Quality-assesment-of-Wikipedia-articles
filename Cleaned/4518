The E.O. Green School shooting refers to the shooting and murder of Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; King (January 13, 19931 - February 12, 2008), a 15-year-old student at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California, United States, on February 12, 2008. Fellow student Brandon McInerney is currently being charged with murder and his lawyer is seeking a relocation of the venue.2 It was alleged that the suspect's motivation for the crime was that King was gay and had asked McInerney to be his Valentine,3 and as such, the shooting was deemed a hate crime murder by prosecutors.4
Overview
At approximately 8:15 a.m., on February 12, 2008, an eighth grade 15-year-old boy, identified as Lawrence Fobes King (&lt;U+201C&gt;Larry&lt;U+201D&gt;)5 was shot in the head in a computer lab classroom.6 King was transported to St. John's Regional Medical Center and was listed in serious condition. Examiners had declared King brain dead.7 King was kept on life support until February 15, 2008, so his organs could be donated.8 It was reported that King was shot because he was openly gay and sometimes dressed in a &quot;feminine&quot; manner. Prosecutors have discussed charging the alleged shooter, 14-year-old McInerney, with premeditated murder with enhancements for the use of a firearm and commission of a hate crime.9
Response
Thousands of people across the country have rallied together to remember Lawrence King. The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), an organization working to end bullying and harassment in schools regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity/expression, and the Gay-Straight Alliance Network (GSA Network), a California youth-driven gay rights organization, have organized local vigils in memory of Lawrence King. Vigils and marches were organized all across the United States.10 An estimated 1,000 people marched in Oxnard, California the weekend following the murder to pay their respects to King and raise public awareness of homophobic violence.11
California Diversity Bill
The introduction of a new diversity education bill by California Assemblyman Mike Eng was introduced on behalf of King. The new bill would require mandatory classes on diversity and tolerance in California school districts. &quot;We need to teach young people that there's a curriculum called tolerance education that should be in every school. We should teach young people that diversity is not something to be assaulted, but diversity is something that needs to be embraced because diversity makes California the great state that it is,&quot; Eng said.12
