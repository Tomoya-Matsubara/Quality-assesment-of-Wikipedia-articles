Background
 The main feud heading into Backlash on the Raw brand was between John Cena, Edge, Shawn Michaels and Randy Orton, with the four feuding over the WWE Championship. At the 2007 Royal Rumble in January, Michaels was one of the final two participants of the Royal Rumble match before getting eliminated by The Undertaker.78 On the February 5 2007 edition of Raw, Michaels defeated Edge and Randy Orton in a Triple Threat match to become the number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 23.9 At WrestleMania 23, Cena defeated Michaels to retain the WWE Championship, forcing him to submit to the STFU.10 On the April 9 edition of Raw, a match between Michaels and Orton to determine the number one contender ended in a no-contest after both men's shoulders were on the mat while they were pinning one another. Later that night, during Edge's talk show, The Cutting Edge, Edge claimed that Jonathan Coachman had named him the number one contender. Honorary General Manager Michael Pena, from the Make-a-Wish Foundation, however, announced that Michaels, Orton, and Edge would face Cena for the title at Backlash in a Fatal Four-Way match.11
The predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between The Undertaker and Batista, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble, in January, The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match by last eliminating Shawn Michaels. As a result, he was given the right to a title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE's three major championships (ECW World, World Heavyweight, or WWE).12 After teasing all three World Champions (Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John Cena), on the February 5 edition of Raw, Undertaker chose World Heavyweight Champion Batista as his opponent for WrestleMania 23.13 At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship.141516 Their feud, however, did not end, as Theodore Long booked them in a Last Man Standing match for the title at Backlash.17
The main feud on the ECW brand was between Bobby Lashley and Team McMahon (Umaga, Vince and Shane McMahon), with Lashley and Vince feuding over the ECW World Championship. The feud started on the February 26 edition of Raw, when Lashley was selected by Donald Trump to compete at WrestleMania 23. Lashley was selected to compete against Vince's representative, Umaga, in a Hair vs. Hair match.18 At WrestleMania, Lashley defeated Umaga and after the match, Trump and Lashley shaved Vince bald.19 On the April 9 edition of Raw, Shane challenged Lashley to a Hair vs. Title match for the ECW World Championship. Shane got himself intentionally disqualified, but did not shave his head. After the match, Umaga and Vince assisted Shane in attacking Lashley. After the beating, Vince booked a 3-on-1 Handicap match for the ECW World Championship between Lashley and Team McMahon.20

A 3-on-1 Handicap match for the ECW World Championship between champion Bobby Lashley and Team McMahon (Umaga, Vince and Shane McMahon) was next. Near the end of the match, Shane hit Lashley with the title belt, which was followed by a diving splash from Umaga. Umaga then tagged in Vince, who attempted to pin Lashley. Lashley, however, kicked out. Vince then tagged in Umaga, who once again executed a diving splash from Umaga. After being tagged in, Vince pinned Lashley to win the ECW World Championship and the match for his team.2526

The main event was a Fatal Four-Way match for the WWE Championship between champion John Cena, Edge, Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels. During the opening minutes of the match, Michaels performed a moonsault onto Cena, Edge, and Orton outside the ring. Near the end of the match, Edge speared Orton after Cena reversed an RKO attempt by Orton. Cena then performed an FU on Edge, which was followed by Michaels executing Sweet Chin Music on Cena. When Cena fell, he landed on Orton and the referee counted the pinfall. Cena won the match and retained the WWE Championship.28
Aftermath
