Korn (styled as Ko&lt;U+042F&gt;n1) is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, formed in 1993. The current band line up includes four members: Jonathan Davis, James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu, and Ray Luzier. The band was formed as an expansion of L.A.P.D. They have collaborated with musicians such as Chino Moreno from Deftones, Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from The Pharcyde and Nas.
The band released their first demo album, Neidermeyer's Mind, in 1993.2 Their debut album, Korn was released in 1994, where they featured the same musicians that had performed on Neidermeyer's Mind. The band began recording Life Is Peachy in April 1996, and released it on October 15, 1996. Follow the Leader is recognized as Korn's mainstream breakthrough, peaking at number one on the Billboard 200 in 1998, along with the following album, Issues in 1999.3 The band released Untouchables on June 11, 2002, and later released Take a Look in the Mirror on November 21, 2003, both peaking in the top ten of the Billboard 200. Their first compilation album, Greatest Hits Vol. 1, peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. See You on the Other Side was released on December 6, 2005, and Korn's untitled album was released nearly two years later on July 31, 2007. Korn III: Remember Who You Are, the band's ninth studio album, was released July 13, 2010 via Roadrunner Records.4 Korn currently has 36 singles, 25 of which have charted.567 The band has six video albums and 32 music videos.

History
L.A.P.D. and formation (1989&lt;U+2013&gt;93)
Before Korn was formed, three of the original members of the band were associated with the heavy metal band L.A.P.D.: James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, and David Silveria.131415 Originally consisting of Richard Morrill, James Shaffer, and Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria joined when he was 15.16 The band moved their location from Bakersfield, California to Los Angeles, California. As a result, Silveria dropped out of high school and Shaffer stayed in Bakersfield.17 When Shaffer reunited with the band, the band found a manager and released an EP entitled Love and Peace Dude in 1989 through Triple X Records.1819 L.A.P.D. released their first full-length studio album on May 3, 1991 which consisted of eleven tracks. The album was entitled Who's Laughing Now.20 After releasing their two albums, L.A.P.D. broke up and Shaffer, Arvizu, and Silveria, along with Brian Welch and Jonathan Davis formed a band later to be known as &quot;Korn&quot;.21
Korn achieved its name after a fan suggested the name &quot;Corn&quot;. At first, the group rejected the idea, but later, with no alternate names, the group selected the name &quot;Corn&quot;. Later, Shaffer suggested spelling their name with a &quot;K&quot; instead of a &quot;C&quot;, and Shaffer came up with the idea to reverse the &quot;R&quot;, so the band's name would appear as &quot;Ko&lt;U+042F&gt;n&quot;.22 The logo was designed by lead vocalist Jonathan Davis.23 Silveria explained, &quot;the music makes the name, because Korn's a dumb name. But once we get established, it makes the name cool.&quot;24
At Huntington Beach, California, Korn rented a studio from Jeff Creath, called &quot;Underground Chicken Sound.&quot; While they were recording at Underground Chicken Sound, a crowd had been loitering outside the studio.25 The band began playing a prelude to a later song, &quot;Clown&quot; resulting in a larger crowd gathering. Arvizu said the crowd gathered because it sounded so &quot;different.&quot;26 Korn started performing at gigs in the summer of 1993, with members saying that touring was a &quot;pain-in-the-ass.&quot; While in Huntington Beach, the band was spotted by Epic/Immortal Records A&amp;R employee Paul Pontius. Pontius would describe Korn's sound as &quot;the new genre of rock.&quot; In 1993, Korn released their first demo album, Neidermeyer's Mind. Their album had very limited printing, and was never well received by critics or fans.27 It was released to record companies and to people who filled out a flyer given out at gigs they played for free with Biohazard and House of Pain.28
Debut album (1994&lt;U+2013&gt;95)
By May 1994, Korn began recording their debut album with Ross Robinson.29 On October 11, 1994, Korn released a self&lt;U+2013&gt;titled album through Immortal/Epic,30 which eventually peaked at number 72 on the Billboard 200 in 1995, as well as peaking number one on Top Heatseekers chart.31 The album received positive reviews by critics, and it is said to have established the new wave of metal.3233 As well as sparking the nu metal genre, the album also started record producer Ross Robinson's music career.34 It also influenced other bands, like Slipknot, Coal Chamber, and Limp Bizkit.3536
After Korn finished recording the album, they began touring with Biohazard. Their record company gave them enough money for their own tour bus. Korn's first gig was in Atlanta, Georgia.37 About half way through the tour, their tour bus that their record company gave them stopped working, and Korn had to find a new one.38 Their first tour was not very successful in promoting the album.39 Korn started the Sick of It All Tour in January 1995.40 Aside from touring, Korn released four singles. &quot;Blind&quot; was released in 1994, and &quot;Shoots and Ladders&quot; was released in 1995. The latter received a Grammy nomination in 1997 for Best Metal Performance.41 &quot;Need To&quot; was also released in 1995, although the exact date is unknown. The fourth and final single, &quot;Clown,&quot; was released in 1996. As of 2010, none of the singles have ever charted.42
Life Is Peachy (1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97)
After the success of their debut, Korn decided to enter the studio again for a second album.43 By then, the band had created a large fan base, and the expectations for their follow up album were high.4445 They went back into the studio in early April 1996 at Indigo Ranch Studios, Malibu, California.46 s drum quality.47

}}The album was released October 15, 1996,48 and despite minimal radio airplay and television attention, Life Is Peachy debuted at number three on the Billboard 200,4950 and peaked at number one on the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand sales chart.51 The album sold 106,000 copies in its first week.52 Jon Pareles from The New York Times said that the band was &quot;Mad at Everybody, Including Themselves.&quot; The album was certified a 2&lt;U+00D7&gt; Platinum in the United States, Platinum in Australia and Gold in Canada.53
The first single, &quot;No Place to Hide&quot;, spawned a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance.54 &quot;A.D.I.D.A.S.&quot; was the second single and only music video from the album, which also did well, and earned the band the most airplay until their next album's singles.55 The band gained more popularity after co-headlining the Lollapalooza music festival in 1997 with Tool. However, Korn was forced to stop touring after Shaffer was diagnosed with viral meningitis.56 A promotional disc was released in 1997 to promote both the band and the Life Is Peachy Tour featuring Incubus and The Urge and included three live tracks.57
Follow the Leader, mainstream success (1998&lt;U+2013&gt;99)
Prior to the release of the band's third album, Korn produced a weekly online TV show, KornTV,5859 which documented the making of the record and featured special guests such as porn star Ron Jeremy, Limp Bizkit, and 311.60 The project also gave fans the chance to call in and ask the band questions, an approach that represented one of the first times a band utilized the Internet in such a way.61 Korn released their third album, Follow the Leader, on August 18, 1998,62 which featured a number of guest vocalists such as Ice Cube, Tre Hardson from the Pharcyde, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and actor Cheech Marin on the hidden track &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; (written by Marin himself).63
Korn launched a political campaign-style tour to promote the release of Follow the Leader.6465 The tour took the group, on a chartered jet, all over North America to help promote Follow the Leader.66 They talked to fans and answered questions during special &quot;fan conferences&quot;, which were organized at every stop along the tour route, and signed autographs. Jim Rose hosted the entire &quot;Kampaign&quot; tour.6768
The album was considered by band members a complete success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 268,000 copies sold,6970 and spawning two of their biggest singles: &quot;Got the Life&quot; and &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot;.71 They both exposed Korn to a wider, mainstream audience, with the music videos being mainstays on MTV's Total Request Live. &quot;Got the Life&quot; was the show's very first &quot;retired&quot; video,727374 with &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; reaching that same success months later.757677
&quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, and received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.78 The video also earned nine MTV Video Music Awards nominations for Video of the Year, Best Rock Video, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Viewer's Choice.79 It eventually won two awards, one being for Best Rock Video and the other for Best Editing.808182 &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; remains one of Korn's biggest singles on Billboard, having reached number six on Alternative Songs and number ten on Mainstream Rock Songs.83 Follow the Leader is considered by members of Korn to be the band's most commercially&lt;U+2013&gt;successful album,8485 being certified five-times Platinum by the RIAA and having sold almost ten million copies worldwide.8687
Issues (1999&lt;U+2013&gt;2001)
The band's fourth album, Issues, produced by Brendan O'Brien, was released on November 16, 1999,88 featuring cover art designed by Alfredo Carlos, who won a contest held for the fans by MTV.89 Issues was released during a week of many highly-anticipated records. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with more than 573,000 copies sold,90 keeping Dr. Dre's album 2001 and C&lt;U+00E9&gt;line Dion's greatest hits album from hitting number one.9192
To celebrate the album's release, the band performed the record in its entirety in front of a live audience at New York's historic Apollo Theater and broadcast the concert simultaneously across many radio stations.93 This performance made Korn the first rock band to ever perform at The Apollo, after Buddy Holly in the late 1950s.94 This special event featured the New York Police Department marching drum and bagpipe band conducted by Richard Gibbs as well as a group of back-up singers to enhance the more melodic choruses Davis used on the album.95 A snippet of &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; was featured on RealVideo with a brief interpretive dance by bassist Reginald Arvizu,96 and also featured on their official website as an MP3 file, although its release was against the advice of its attorneys and corporate establishment.97 The album was also promoted by the band's highly successful Sick and Twisted Tour.
Earlier that year, Korn had appeared on an episode of South Park, titled &quot;Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery&quot;, in which the first single from Issues, &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot;, was premiered.9899 Korn released two more singles from Issues, &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; and &quot;Somebody Someone&quot;, both of which fared well on Billboard.100 Music videos were filmed for all three singles, with long time friend Fred Durst directing &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot;, and Martin Weisz directing a concept video for &quot;Make Me Bad&quot;, as well as a performance video for &quot;Somebody Someone&quot;, which featured the use of CGI effects. Every video was a staple on Total Request Live, two of which made it to retirement.101 Issues is considered by some critics to be less hip hop-influenced and closer to alternative metal than nu metal.102 It was certified three-times Platinum, following up the success of Follow the Leader.103
Untouchables (2002&lt;U+2013&gt;03)
On June 10, 2002, after a year and a half of touring, Korn re-emerged into the media with their fifth album, Untouchables. It debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with 434,000 in sales.104 The band has blamed Internet piracy for the drop in sales, as an unmastered version of the album had leaked three months prior to its official release date.105 On April 2, 2002, the Shock Jocks, an American radio program, began airing songs from Untouchables. After playing a few songs, the broadcasters retrieved a cease-and-desist letter from Sony Music Entertainment. One broadcaster said &quot;The reason for the premature premiere was to infuriate a rival New York station, which disallows their in-studio guests to appear on 'The Opie and Anthony Show.'&quot;106 The release of this album was preceded by a show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York, a day prior to the album's release, broadcast digitally throughout movie theatres in the United States.107
The album contained experiments and styles never previously attempted by Korn. Allmusic related: &quot;The band is far more experimental this time out, delivering Helmet-like ringing guitars that melt and morph into each other, a mix of Metallica-esque blastbeats and tight funk drumming from the constantly improving David Silveria, and memorable riffs that take the shape of dark sound structures and offer more than just a collection of chords.&quot;108 The first two videos from Untouchables, &quot;Here to Stay&quot; and &quot;Thoughtless&quot;, were directed by the Hughes Brothers.109 &quot;Here to Stay&quot; earned Korn a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.110 &quot;Here to Stay&quot; peaked at number four on both the Alternative Songs and Mainstream Rock Songs charts.111
Take a Look in the Mirror, Greatest Hits Vol. 1, Head's departure (2003&lt;U+2013&gt;05)
Due to the album leaking onto the Internet, Take a Look in the Mirror was released on a Friday, November 21, 2003; four days earlier than its original release date.112 The album therefore received a weekend's worth of sales, along with a shortage in shipments, both of which resulted in a poor showing on the Billboard 200. During its first full week, Take a Look in the Mirror soared ten places from number 19 to number nine, bringing the album's total sales to 179,000. It is the first album where Korn produced the album themselves. The band explained that they want fans to hear the music as it should be.113 The album presented different styles and themes compared to previous albums. Lead vocalist Jonathan Davis related: &quot;The whole album is about love, hate and my hate of people and just losing my mind. The previous albums I did, I think the last three, I was coming from a place of hurt. And I just finally got to the point where I'm done hurting and I'm just pissed off about it now. It's turned back to just sheer hate and anger. And it definitely comes across on the album.&quot; MTV said that Davis convinced his fans that they &quot;will be shocked, particularly with the album's second track, &quot;Break Some Off,&quot; which he called 'brutal'.&quot;114 Korn released the single &quot;Did My Time&quot; on July 22, 2003,115 which was used to promote the film but did not appear on the soundtrack to Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life due to unspecified legal issues.116 &quot;Did My Time&quot; gave Korn another Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category.117
Korn released their greatest hits album, Greatest Hits Vol. 1, on October 5, 2004.118 The album debuted at number four on Billboard, selling more than 129,000 copies.119 This album assembles choice tracks from six Korn studio albums between 1994 and 2003.120 The first single was a cover of the song &quot;Word Up!&quot;, which was originally composed by the group Cameo.121 Special editions of the album included a DVD titled Korn: Live at CBGB featuring seven select songs from their November 24, 2003 show at CBGB.122
In early 2005, Brian Welch announced that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said &lt;U+201C&gt;I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t do it. I wanted to die. No one knew what I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [on drugs]. I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said [to God], &lt;U+2018&gt;Show me how to quit.'&quot;123124 Since, Welch has released two Autobiographies, and released one solo album.125
See You on the Other Side (2005&lt;U+2013&gt;06)
Upon completing their record deal with Sony, Korn partnered with EMI and signed to Virgin Records. As part of this innovative arrangement, Virgin paid Korn $25 million upfront in exchange for a share in the profits of their next two studio albums, including tours and merchandising. Virgin also received a 30 percent stake in the band's licensing, ticket sales and other revenue sources.126127
The band's first album for Virgin, See You on the Other Side, was released on December 6, 2005,128 and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200,129 scanning close to 221,000 copies.130 The album managed to stay in the top half of the Billboard 200 for thirty-four consecutive weeks.131 The first single from the album, &quot;Twisted Transistor&quot;, was accompanied by a music video directed by Dave Meyers in which hip hop artists Xzibit, Lil' Jon, Snoop Dogg, and David Banner portray Korn.132 The single itself peaked at number three on Billboard{{'}}s Mainstream Rock Songs, Korn's highest entry thus far, and number nine on Alternative Songs.133 The second single, &quot;Coming Undone&quot;, had its performance-based video directed by Little X,134135 who previously helmed hip hop and R&amp;B videos.136 See You on the Other Side was certified Platinum, and by mid-2007 had sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide.137
Korn held a press conference at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on January 13, 2006, announcing the See You on the Other Side Tour.138 10 Years and Mudvayne were selected to open all dates of the trek, which kicked off in their hometown of Bakersfield, on what Mayor Harvey Hall officially declared as &quot;Korn Day&quot;, February 26.139 The resurrection of their Family Values Tour was announced on April 18, 2006, which featured co-headliners Deftones, Stone Sour, Flyleaf, and the Japanese metal group, Dir En Grey on the main stage.140 Korn and Evanescence co-headlined the 2007 edition, with Atreyu, 2006 alumni Flyleaf, Hellyeah, and Trivium rounding out the main stage.141
While promoting See You on the Other Side in Europe, Jonathan Davis was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, a blood platelet disorder that hospitalized him for the weekend and prevented him from performing at the renowned Download Festival.142 Despite the illness, the band still performed, with guest singers including Corey Taylor of the nu metal band Slipknot and hard rock band Stone Sour, Skindred's Benji Webbe, and Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows. This led to Korn canceling the rest of their European bill for 2006,143 including the Hellfest Summer Open Air. It was originally unknown to the public what his ailment was, but the singer revealed in a letter to fans that he was &quot;dangerously low on blood platelets and at a high risk of death from a hemorrhage if the problem was not treated&quot;.144
Untitled album, MTV Unplugged, David Silveria's departure (2006&lt;U+2013&gt;08)
 In early December 2006 it was announced that founding drummer David Silveria would be taking an indefinite &lt;U+201C&gt;temporary hiatus&lt;U+201D&gt; from the band.145146 Korn then performed at the MTV studios in Times Square on December 9, 2006, for the MTV Unplugged series, which was broadcasted on February 23, 2007, through MTV.com and on March 2, 2007, across North American, South American, European and Asian MTV stations.147 Korn played a 14-song acoustic set complete with guest appearances by The Cure and Amy Lee of Evanescence.148 The performance was eventually cut down to 11 songs for the album, two of which did not air on MTV. Sales of nearly 51,000 brought MTV Unplugged: Korn to number nine in its first week out.149
Korn's untitled album was released on July 31, 2007, debuting at number two on Billboard with 123,000 copies sold in its first week.150 It concluded Korn's deal with Virgin Records,151 and features touring keyboardist Zac Baird, giving the tracks a deeper, atmospheric sound.152 Drumming duties were left up to Terry Bozzio, and Bad Religion's Brooks Wackerman, as David Silveria went on a hiatus.153 Joey Jordison from Slipknot played drums during Korn's live shows until the permanent addition of Ray Luzier, confirming David's departure.154155156 &quot;Evolution&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; were released as singles to promote the untitled album. They each charted on Billboard{{'}}s Mainstream Rock Songs chart at number four and number nine, respectively.157 A third single, &quot;Kiss&quot;, had a limited release in April 2008.158159 Korn covered the song &quot;Kidnap the Sandy Claws&quot; in 2007, which was originally written by Paul Reubens, Catherine O'Hara, and Danny Elfman. It was released on Nightmare Revisited.160
Korn III: Remember Who You Are (2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010)
Ubisoft reported in October 2008 that Korn had &quot;written and recorded an original song inspired by Ubisoft's &quot;Haze&quot; video game, simply entitled &quot;Haze&quot;,161 which was released on April 22, 2008.162 Korn also released a live DVD, Korn: Live in Montreux 2004, one of their performances with former guitarist Brian Welch on May 12, 2008.163 Additionally, a second greatest hits compilation titled Playlist: The Very Best of Korn was released on April 29, 2008.164 Korn announced in February 2009 that they were playing at the Rock Fest in Cadott, Wisconsin, as well as the third annual Rock on the Range in Columbus, Ohio.165 The band was also confirmed for the Download Festival taking place in the UK, sub-headlining to Faith No More, as well as the simultaneous German festivals Rock am Ring and Rock im Park.166
In a YouTube video, bassist Fieldy affirmed that the &quot;Chi Song&quot; project he was putting together (released as &quot;A Song for Chi&quot;) which was released recently to raise money for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng who was in a car crash in late 2008, which resulted in him falling into a coma.167 Fieldy revealed that Slipknot guitarist Jim Root, Clint Lowery of Sevendust, drummer Dave McClain of Machine Head and former Korn guitarist Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, would be some of the many musicians playing on the song.168
Along with the announcement of the Ballroom Blitz Tour on March 15, 2010, the title for the new album was revealed as Korn III: Remember Who You Are.169170 Later that month, Munky announced that Korn has officially signed to Roadrunner Records.171 Jonathan Davis related: &quot;We're going to go to Roadrunner. [It is] real exciting for us, too, because they're one of the last record companies to let you do what you want to do and, um, all the great bands around are on that label and everything seems to just work out right and it seems like a good home for us right now.&quot;172 Korn announced the track listing on April 24, 2010,173 and May 5, 2010, Roadrunner Records released a promotional single titled &quot;Oildale (Leave Me Alone)&quot;, for streaming.174 The single was simultaneously released for radio airplay, peaking at number ten on Billboard{{'}}s Mainstream Rock Songs and number twenty-nine on Alternative Songs.175 Korn released the music video for &quot;Oildale (Leave Me Alone)&quot; on May 31, 2010,176 and on July 1, 2010, Korn played &quot;Oildale (Leave Me Alone)&quot; and premiered a follow-up single, &quot;Let the Guilt Go,&quot; on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.177 The band released Korn III: Remember Who You Are in the US on July 13, 2010.178 It debuted at its peak of number two on the Billboard 200 with 63,000 purchases reported.179 Korn performed &quot;Let the Guilt Go&quot; on the late-night television talk show Lopez Tonight on August 24, 2010.180181182 The song's music video premiered on September 2, 2010.183184185 Korn will be co-headlining the Music as a Weapon V tour with Disturbed during winter 2011. The tour will also feature supporting acts Sevendust and In This Moment.186
Next album (2011&lt;U+2013&gt;present)
According to guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, Korn has begun writing new material for their next album. He explains, &quot;We have probably three songs we wrote a couple, two, three months ago. We went into the studio, we wrote some songs, Jon demoed the songs on his computer, and then we took them into the studio and played them live and tweaked them a little bit. Then we put those down and recorded them. They're cool. They kind of remind me a little bit of the Soundgarden style, that sort of Seattle sound&lt;U+2026&gt; just one of them. The other songs are sort of different, a little more in the experimental stage right now. I don't want to give too much away. We're definitely moving forward, we'll probably start recording in April to try and finetune this sound we're developing.&quot;187 It has been rumored across the web that Brendan O'Brien will be producing the album. He previously worked with the band on their fourth studio album, Issues. It was also stated last year by Jonathan Davis in an interview with ARTISTdirect that one track recorded for the album features acoustic guitar &lt;U+2014&gt; a first for Korn &lt;U+2014&gt; tentatively titled &quot;Lullaby for a Sadist&quot;.188
The band will be making their second Rock on the Range apperance on May 21, 2011, at Crew Stadium, in Columbus, OH.
Style
The band has stated that their primary influences include Sepultura, Faith No More, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine, Slayer, Pink Floyd, Primus, Tool, Ministry, Mr. Bungle, Biohazard, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Pantera, Beastie Boys, Black Sabbath, and Jane's Addiction.189190191 Much of their work has been inspired by hip hop music, as suggested in the cover song &quot;Wicked&quot;, and &quot;All in the Family&quot;.192193194
They are the first band to be labeled as nu metal, starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.195 Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as rap metal, thrash rap, and pimp rock.196 Their debut album mixed metal, rock, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Alongside nu metal, the band is often labeled as heavy metal, alternative metal, post grunge, and rap metal.197 Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes.198199 In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world.200
The band's debut album warranted a Parental Advisory label solely because of the album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song &quot;Daddy&quot; was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis &quot;When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really like to talk about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it...&quot;201202203 &quot;Kill You&quot; was written in spite of Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother.204 Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like &quot;Justin&quot; and &quot;Pretty&quot; written about incidents occurring during adulthood.205
Many of Korn's songs do not include a guitar solo. Bassist Reginald Arvizu plays his instrument using both the techniques of fingerstyle and slapping. Jonathan Davis was said by Doug Small to be &quot;the eye of the storm around which the music of Korn rages.&quot;206 Small described the band as &quot;a basket-case full of contradictions.&quot;207 Although the band virtually had no support by television or by radio broadcasting in its first four years, Korn would go on to influence Slipknot, Vanilla Ice, Evanescence, Seether, Machine Head, One Minute Silence, Kittie, Endo, Taproot, Mudvayne, Crazy Town, Otep, System of a Down, Hoobastank, Linkin Park, Five Pointe O, Lacuna Coil, Chris Volz, Videodrone, Theory of a Deadman, Thousand Foot Krutch, Avenged Sevenfold, Breaking Benjamin, Disturbed, Bleed the Sky, Papa Roach, Coal Chamber, Emmure, Staind, Suicide Silence, Cold, Impending Doom, Limp Bizkit, Three Days Grace and Flyleaf.208209 Korn also created a fan-basis described by both Doug Small and Eaton Entertainment as extremely loyal.210
Criticism and controversy
Vulgarity in lyrics
Prior to the release of 1998's Follow the Leader, Gretchen Plewes, a Zeeland high school assistant principal, said in an interview for a Michigan newspaper that the music is &quot;indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting&quot; after giving a student a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo on it.211 WKLQ was filmed giving away hundreds of free Korn T-shirts, which were donated by the band, outside the school. Ottawa County policemen helped hand out shirts as well.212 The student who was suspended, Eric VanHoven, was interviewed by MTV, and said that he had worn the shirt &quot;because it made him look cooliolishish.213 Korn filed a cease and desist order against Plewes and the school district for their comments. They also threatened with a multi-million lawsuit, but both files were dropped due to the band member's personal lives.214
Former band members
In September 2009, Korn guitarist Munky, in an interview with Altitude TV, alleged that the band had denied a request by Welch to rejoin the group.215216 Welch denied the claims via his Myspace, stating that Korn had been asking him to rejoin but he had turned down the offers after Jonathan Davis and Munky had refused to meet him when Welch visited Fieldy socially. He also claimed that for four years he had not been paid royalties due to him.217218219 Weeks later, in reference to Korn's early albums, Davis stated in an interview with pulseoftheradio that Welch had not contributed to writing material because of his drug usage.220
