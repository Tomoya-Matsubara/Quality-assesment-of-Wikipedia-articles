Roublot is a traditional French variety of white wine grape that is a sibling of Chardonnay. It was once quite widely grown near Auxerre.
History
In the early 19th century, Roublot made up a third of the area in Saint-Bris-le-Vineux in the west of Chablis. Then the vines were wiped out in the phylloxera epidemic, and uniquely for Burgundy, were replaced by Sauvignon Blanc, the wines of which today are designated Saint-Bris AOC.
DNA fingerprinting has shown that Roublot is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais Blanc (Heunisch) and Pinot, making it a full sibling of famous varieties such as Chardonnay and Aligot&lt;U+00E9&gt;. Gouais Blanc is a Croatian grape, brought to Burgundy by the Romans, which used to be the most widely planted white grape in Germany and eastern France. Gouais Blanc was grown by the peasants in the less favoured sites, next to the better vineyards growing Pinot for their masters. This offered lots of opportunities for hybridisation, and the offspring benefited from hybrid vigour as the parents were genetically quite different.
The synonym C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar Blanc is interesting, as it reflects a traditional link with the ancient red grape C&lt;U+00E9&gt;sar, a Pinot/Argant cross.
Distribution and wines
Roublot has just about disappeared from commercial production.
Vine and viticulture
Like many Pinot/Gouais crosses, Roublot is quite vigorous, with small bunches. It is a very unreliable yielder, thanks to its high susceptibility to powdery mildew and grey rot.
