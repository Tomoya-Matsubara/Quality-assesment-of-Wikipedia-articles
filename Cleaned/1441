Grant Normington (born 9 May, 1990 in Kingston upon Hull, England) is a professional footballer currently playing for Grimsby Town.
Career
Grant was added to the first team squad during the 2007-2008 season by Alan Buckley and was offered a new contract for the following season.
He made his debut for the club under Mike Newell as he came on as a substitute for James Hunt in the 82nd minute of the clubs 0-0 away draw with Exeter City. Normington was then given a new two year contract on 28 November 2008 by the club after impressing since the arrival of the new manager.
In an interview to the Grimsby Telegraph on 9 December Normington commented at his relief at his chances under the new manager, stating that Alan Buckley failed to help his in his career.
&quot;The feedback from the gaffer has been positive.
&quot;When the old manager was here, he didn't talk to me as much and didn't help me out as much.
&quot;Alan Buckley didn't really give me a chance - not even a sniff.
&quot;I wasn't even on the bench sometimes - even when there were seven subs in the cup, he named just six.
&quot;Since Mike Newell got here, he has been great with me.
&quot;He helps me and tells me my chance will come and this contract backs that up.&quot;1
