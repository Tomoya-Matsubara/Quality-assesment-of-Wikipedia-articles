Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio Hermeto Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, the Marquis of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; (11 January 1801 &lt;U+2013&gt; 3 September 1856) was a Brazilian statesman, diplomat, judge and monarchist during the period of the Empire of Brazil (1822&lt;U+2013&gt;1889). As co-founder of the Brazilian Conservative Party,1 he championed liberalism, exceptionalism, state authority and a representative, parliamentary monarchy.2 Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; had been schooled in his party's principles by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, who was renowned for his intellectual capacity and leadership.3
Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; was born to a humble family in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Carlos do Jacu&lt;U+00ED&gt;, in what was then the captaincy of Minas Gerais. After attending the University of Coimbra in Portugal, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; was appointed a judge in 1826 and later elevated to appellate court justice. In 1830, he was elected to represent Minas Gerais in the Chamber of Deputies; he was reelected in 1834 and 1838, and would ultimately hold the post for ten years. His natural leadership skills made him one of the most influential politicians in the country. In the aftermath of Pedro I's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the Emperor's son, Pedro II, soon dissolved into chaos. Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; and his party's stalwart and unconditional defense of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued with factious disputes and rebellions, which might easily have led the nation into dictatorship or dismemberment.
Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro province in 1841, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party in the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by Pedro II to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first President of the Council of Ministers of Brazil, while concurrently serving as Minister of Justice (a position he had briefly held in 1833), but lost the office after a quarrel with the Emperor.
After years in the opposition, in 1849, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; was appointed by the national government as president of Pernambuco province to investigate a Liberal rebellion that had taken place a year earlier and urge that the rebels receive a fair trial. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance between Brazil and that country, as well as with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre R&lt;U+00ED&gt;os, against the Argentine Confederation headed by dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas. In 1853, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; was appointed president of the Council of Ministers and headed a highly successful Cabinet credited with ushering in several vital reforms. On 3 September 1856, while still in office, he died unexpectedly of an unknown febrile condition. To this day, he is regarded as one of the most influential politicians of his time and one of the greatest statesmen in the history of Brazil.4
Early years
 Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio Hermeto Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was born on 11 January 1801, in the freguesia (civil parish) of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Carlos do Jacu&lt;U+00ED&gt;, in what was then the captaincy of Minas Gerais, to Antonio Neto Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o and Joana Severina Augusta de Lemos.567 He was named after Saint Honorina.8 On his father's side, he was descended from Portugal's powerful Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o clan,9 which had settled in Brazil in the 17th century.10 Antonio Neto was a military officer from one of the family's less prosperous branches; in 1801 he held the rank of furriel (3rd Sergeant).1112131415 He was widowed on 10 November 1806, and on 11 January 1807 wed Rita de C&lt;U+00E1&gt;ssia Soares do Couto, the daughter of his late wife's sister.1617
Little is known of Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's early years. He first lived in Paracat&lt;U+00FA&gt; then moved to Vila Rica (now Ouro Preto), the capital of Minas Gerais at the time, where he spent his childhood and adolescence.1819 He was raised by Colonel Nicolau Soares Couto, his stepmother's father.20 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o had a younger sister, Balbina Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;ria,21 and a brother from his father's second marriage named Nicolau Neto Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o (later baron of Santa Maria).22 His father made great efforts to provide him with an education of much higher quality than would normally be expected in a family of their limited financial means.232425 At age 16, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was commissioned as a lieutenant and standard-bearer of the 2nd Militia Cavalry Regiment, 1st Company, in Vila Rica.26
His father was promoted to captain in 1819, increasing his income and making it possible for Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o to go to Portugal and enroll in the University of Coimbra's law school in 1820.27 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o received a bachelor's degree in Law in 1824, and his Master's diploma on 18 June 1825.28 He was an excellent student29 and associated with Brazilian classmates, including Paulino Soares (who would later become one of his greatest allies30) and Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (who later proved to be a fierce political opponent).31 During the Portuguese Revolution of 1820, he supported the constitutionalists, who advocated a national constitution to limit the powers of the Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and, if so, to what degree.32 He was employed in a law firm for a few months33 before returning to Brazil on 9 August 1825.3435
Entry into politics
From judge to national deputy
On 20 May 1826, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o married his first cousin Maria Henriqueta Neto (born 1809), the daughter of his father's brother Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Neto Carneiro Leme.3637 Unlike his brother, Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Neto was a rich and influential man who owned a rice processing plant and was also involved in diamonds and the slave trade.3839 The couple had four children: Hon&lt;U+00F3&gt;rio Hermeto Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Filho, Henrique Hermeto (later Baron of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;), Maria Em&lt;U+00ED&gt;lia and Maria Henriqueta.40 
On 14 October 1826, he was named to a three-year term as magistrate with jurisdiction over the villages of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Sebasti&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, Bela da Princesa and Ubatuba, in the then-province of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo.4142 To S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Sebasti&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, he brought his wife and gifts from his father-in-law: eight slaves, expensive furniture and a set of silver tableware.4344 Nothing of note seems to have occurred during his tenure as magistrate, apart from a quarrel with the village's military commander, lieutenant-colonel Lopo da Cunha d&lt;U+2019&gt;E&lt;U+00E7&gt;a e Costa. Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o and Cunha disagreed on the boundaries of their respective jurisdictions, in what was in reality a personal dispute over who held power over the region.4546 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o ended up being promoted, adding to his duties the post of deputy Judge Advocate General of the Navy in Rio de Janeiro, then known as the &quot;Neutral Municipality&quot;. He left S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Sebasti&lt;U+00E3&gt;o on 25 August 1828. In 1829, he was appointed as an appellate court justice,4748 and held this office until retirement in 1848.49 He was prevented from joining the Superior Court of Justice in 1848, as it was forbidden to both hold that position and retain a seat on the Council of State, of which he had become a member by the time.50
Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o campaigned in 1829 to become a member of the Chamber of Deputies as a representative for Minas Gerais. He was elected to a seat in the legislature for the term beginning in April 1830. The law allowed him to work as both judge and legislator at the same time, receiving wages from both offices.51 He had a modest start in the Chamber, primarily focusing on bureaucratic activities such as participation in parliamentary committees.52 A member of the opposition to Emperor Dom Pedro I's government, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o displayed no indication of the energetic leadership and strong personality for which he would later become famous.53 However, this would change radically in the 1830s, upon Brazil's fall into anarchy during the regency period.54
Coimbra bloc
 On 7 April 1831, Emperor Pedro I abdicated and departed for Europe, leaving behind his son Pedro II, a child of five, as emperor. This development was unexpected and deplored by the Brazilian people.55 A regency with little effective authority was created, resulting in nine years of chaos during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions.56
Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was part of what historian Roderick J. Barman called the Coimbra bloc, so named because many of its supporters had graduated from the University of Coimbra.57 The Coimbra bloc was part of a coalition called the Moderate Party, which also included the Nativists political faction, whose main leader was the priest Diogo Ant&lt;U+00F4&gt;nio Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;.58 The Coimbra bloc's main leaders were Pedro de Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo Lima (later Marquis of Olinda) and Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos.59 Vasconcelos acted not only as leader but also as mentor to the younger generation of his faction, which included Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, Paulino de Sousa (Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's former colleague during his Coimbra years) and Joaquim Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Rodrigues Torres (later Viscount of Itabora&lt;U+00ED&gt; and husband to a sister-in-law of Paulino de Sousa).60
One of the two common interests uniting the Nativists and the Coimbra bloc was their support of federalism.61 The Brazilian constitution was overly centralized, and this was one of the main reasons behind their opposition to the former emperor,62 who openly opposed any constitutional amendments.63 The Moderate Party believed it could placate discontent and extinguish any separatist threat by granting more autonomy to the provinces.6465 The other shared interest was their opposition to the restorationist movement.66 The restorationists were politicians and military officers who called for the return of Pedro I as regent for his son.67
Defender of the Constitution
Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was one of the deputies who supported decentralization,68 but progress on this and other matters was delayed while he was forced to deal with two major crises. The first occurred on 19 July 1831 when a group of republicans and insubordinate military officers presented the Chamber of Deputies with a list of 89 names of Brazilians whom they demanded be deported. The list included some senators.69 Had the government acceded to their demands, it would have become further demoralized and weakened. Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o averted that threat by giving four speeches during the same day in which he urged the government to refuse this illegal demand.70 He stated that &quot;neither a senator nor the most humble citizen belonging to the lowest class may be deported without having been prosecuted and convicted&quot;,71 and concluded: &quot;The constitution establishes rights and obligations, and, to keep the former, citizens must satisfy the latter; as these are fulfilled, no one can deprive them of the former. Even when a citizen is an evildoer, his rights must be respected, as these do not belong to him but to all.&quot;72 All deputies but one agreed with Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o,73 and the incident was settled with the disbandment of several battalions.74  The second crisis arose on 30 July 1832. A constitutional amendment effecting greater decentralization was voted and approved in the Chamber of Deputies, but still faced major opposition in the Senate.75 Ant&lt;U+00F4&gt;nio Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt; and Aureliano Coutinho (Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's former colleague at Coimbra) planned a coup d&lt;U+2019&gt;&lt;U+00E9&gt;tat. The conspiracy would have had Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt; assume dictatorial powers and immediately enact the constitutional amendment, bypassing confirmation in the Senate.76 Some Nativist deputies (in concert with Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;) brought a proposal before the Chamber that parliament be turned into a constituent assembly and a new constitution be adopted, arguing in part that the senate was filled with restorationists.77
The deputies decided to debate the matter, and Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o delivered a speech that proved to be a turning point in his political life.78 He called on his fellow deputies to uphold the constitution and only make changes through the proper legal channels: &quot;We need not hurt the legal order and [constitutional] principles: we can make fair laws, [...] and in the respected constitution we have safe and legal ways of giving the nation what it wants.&quot; He then begged, &quot;let us not violate it [the constitution], as it is our only safeguard.&quot;79 He managed to rally the deputies to his cause, and in defeating the Nativists' proposal, crush the coup attempt.80
His defense of the constitution owed much to his character. Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was a natural leader, energetic, intelligent, perspicacious, and reasonable. Joaquim Nabuco described him as more a man of action than of ideas.81 He could also be arrogant, rude (even aggressive), and authoritarian;82 it has been observed that he was headstrong, opinionated, and often scathing.83 Pedro II would later remark that his &quot;style of speaking was inelegant, and he had a stutter; but it vanished when he was aroused and at all times his arguments were tight knit, and somebody wittily remarked that the marquis of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;, when he stuttered, stuttered arguments.&quot;84 More important to the nation was his consistent and unconditional support of constitutional order.85 In concert with his colleagues, his efforts prevented restriction of legal rights and kept Brazil from sliding into dictatorship.86
Rise of the Conservative Party
Party's leader in the Chamber of Deputies
Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o had become a leading politician, and was appointed minister of Justice on 13 September 1832.87 He resigned after a few months to avoid becoming entangled in the aftermath of a restorationist uprising in Minas Gerais, in which a relative of his had been involved.88 On 12 August 1834, a constitutional amendment known as the Ato Adicional (Additional Act) was promulgated.89 Among its provisions were the abolition of the Council of State and the establishment of a federal national structure resulting in administrative and political provincial decentralization.90 Local self-government opened new avenues for conflict between political parties. Ceding power to provincial governments merely whetted the ambitions of local politicians, however, and the result was rebellion in areas of the far south and far north of the Empire.91 Whichever party could dominate the provinces also gained control over the electoral and political system. Unwilling to accept being shut out, parties that lost at the ballot rebelled and tried to take power by force.92  In April 1835, an election was held to select a new regent. The outcome was problematic, as no candidate won a majority. Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;, the leader of the Nativists, garnered the most votes and assumed office on 12 October.93 Earlier, news of the premature death of former emperor Pedro I on 24 September 1834 had arrived from Europe, removing the restorationist movement as a factor in national politics.94 Many restorationists joined the ranks of the Coimbra bloc. Both groups shared similar economic, social and ideological views.95 All were steadfast monarchists and opposed Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;.96 The death of Pedro I eliminated the chief difference between them, as the Coimbra bloc had firmly opposed his return.97 The first hints of what would later become the Conservative Party appeared when the Coimbra bloc (boosted with former restorationists) began throwing their support behind candidates other than Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;, and became clearer after Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o began talks with the restorationists in October 1834.98
Once in office, Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt; proved authoritarian, with little inclination to be accountable to parliament. By 1837, his government's credibility and support had vanished. Uprisings in both the north and south had not been suppressed, and other issues were ignored.99 The reinvigorated Coimbra bloc (counting Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o among its leaders)100 intensified its efforts to remove Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt; from office due to inappropriate behavior, and in August 1837, the Regent resigned.101 He was replaced by Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo Lima, who appointed his colleagues to fill ministry portfolios. Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o chose to remain in the Chamber as the party's leader to bolster the new Cabinet.102 The Coimbra bloc had thus come to power based entirely upon its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, rather than through military or Imperial intervention.103 This marked the extinction of the ever-weak Moderate Party.104 The Coimbra bloc began a policy aimed at restoring and enforcing order throughout Brazil. Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was instrumental in passing105 a new law which built upon the Ato Adicional (Additional Act) of 1834 to allow the national government to reassert control over provincial police and courts.106 This greatly enhanced the national government's ability to deal with rebels.107 However, no changes were made to the administrative and political autonomy granted to provinces by the Ato Adicional.108
Feijo's Nativists allied with minor parties and remnants of other factions in opposition to the new government, despite sharing no common principles or ideology. These expedient collaborations gathered malcontents from across the political spectrum: radicals, liberals, restorationists, republicans and reformists.109 During the 1840s, this group would evolve into the &quot;Liberal Party&quot;.110 Fearful that their adversaries would perpetuate themselves in power, the Liberals began to call for lowering the age at which Pedro II would attain majority.111 They saw an opportunity to regain influence by doing away with the regency and dealing instead directly with a pliable young emperor. &quot;Without experience, he might be manipulated by whoever brought him to power.&quot;112 Towards that end, they allied themselves with a new and powerful political bloc which had been formed by politicians and high-ranking servants in the Imperial Palace who were close to the young Emperor. This was known as the &quot;Courtier Faction&quot;, and was led by Aureliano Coutino (Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;'s ally in the 1832 coup attempt).113
Against the Liberal rebellions of 1842
The Coimbra bloc was not opposed to lowering the age of majority for the Emperor, as Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o himself explained, but they demanded that any change should be made through legal means, i.e., a constitutional amendment.114 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o proposed a bill towards that end, but it was defeated in the Senate by only two votes on 17 May 1840.115 The Liberals were less scrupulous and, with popular support and after pressuring the regent to accept the loss of his position, declared Pedro II of age on 23 July 1840.116 The Liberal Cabinet, formed upon the assumption of majority by Pedro II, called national elections in 1840. These were so violent and fraudulent that they became known as &quot;Elei&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00F5&gt;es do cacete&quot; (&quot;Bludgeon elections&quot;).117118 For Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, this meant the loss of his seat as national deputy as his bid for reelection failed.119 The Liberal-Courtier Cabinet did not survive long and its ministers presented their resignations. On 23 March 1841, a new Cabinet was nominated which included Aureliano Coutinho and some ministers taken from the Coimbra bloc.120  Following this, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was awarded with two lifelong offices: his appointment by the Emperor to the Council of State which had been restored by the legislation of 21 November 1841, and his election as senator representing Minas Gerais in late 1842121 (seated on 2 January 1843).122 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was also appointed president (governor) of the province of Rio de Janeiro on 4 October 1841 and assumed this office on 1 December.123
The Liberals did not accept their loss of power gracefully. In May and June 1842, there followed three uprisings within the provinces of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro itself. The pretext was a claim that the Emperor was being restrained by the insolent new government.124 The rebels went so far as to arrest and hold hostage Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o's elderly father and uncle.125 As president, he was in command of the provincial National Guard and traveled through the province organizing the response.126 On 1 July he advanced with 100 soldiers towards Ouro Preto in Minas Gerais where, after defeating the rebels, he freed his father and uncle.127 The remaining rebels were easily defeated, and by late August, the rebellions were over.128 Among the rebel leaders was the former Regent Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;, who was arrested and died shortly afterwards in 1843.129 As Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o traveled from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro, he was received with celebrations and demonstrations of joy by the authorities and populace of the districts through which he passed.130
Members of the Coimbra bloc began to call it the &quot;Party of Order&quot; in contrast to what they perceived as the &quot;unruly&quot; Liberals.131 Their suppression of the uprisings had enhanced the government's reputation and position.132 In the Cabinet, however, there was increasing friction133 caused by Aureliano Coutinho, who owed his seat as minister solely to his influence over Pedro II. It was widely known that he had been antagonistic towards the Party of Order from its inception.134 Aureliano was increasingly shunned and even denounced by other ministers.135 After a new legislature was seated on 1 January 1843, Aureliano's position worsened, and the Cabinet pressured him to resign.136 Pedro II, not wanting to lose Aureliano, opted instead to dismiss the entire Cabinet on 20 January.137
President of the Council of Ministers and fall
On 20 January 1843 the Emperor appointed Senator Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o to head a new Cabinet.138139 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o showed preference for his co-party members when filling Cabinet positions and deliberately overlooked Aureliano Coutinho.140 By personally selecting the Cabinet members, he became Brazil's de facto first prime minister. Prior to this, the emperor had always designated the Cabinet ministers. Following on this precedent, the office of prime minister would be formally instituted four years later, under the title &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot;.141142143 The Party of Order at this time held majorities in the Senate, in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Council of State.144145 The new Cabinet opposed amnesty for participants in the 1842 uprisings, even though many involved had already been imprisoned for almost a year, which rendered the possibilities for successful prosecution unlikely. Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, acting as minister of Justice, also pursued indictments against five senators who had collaborated during the revolts, seeking a trial in the upper house. This came to dominate debate in the Senate and sidelined action on the government's legislative agenda during the ten months of the extended session. As the process dragged on, inflexibility on the part of the Cabinet began to seriously undermine its support.146  In January 1844 he requested the dismissal of the inspector of the Rio de Janeiro customs house, alleging that it was a post under his discretion when it was actually an administrative position, and causing a direct confrontation with Pedro II.147148 The inspector was Saturnino de Sousa e Oliveira Coutinho, a younger brother of Aureliano who had been secretly trying to undermine the Cabinet149 by publishing pamphlets attacking it.150 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o mistakenly believed that he could diminish the political influence of his rival.151 But the Emperor refused, affirming that he had not been presented with any proof of irregularities on the part of Saturnino, who was considered an honest and extremely competent employee.152153 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o insisted on the resignation of the inspector a second time at the end of January, and when he was rebuffed once again, he said, &quot;A boy does not have the right to mock men worn out in the service of the Nation, even if this boy is the Emperor.&quot;154 Pedro II was offended and steadfastly refused to dismiss Saturnino Coutinho, explaining the reason years later: &quot;I considered the dismissal to be unjust, and due to the manner in which Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o insisted on it, I thought that if I gave way I would be considered weak.&quot;155156
Instead of accepting the Emperor's decision, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o offered his resignation along with those of his colleagues.157 Admiring the president's integrity, the Emperor would say years later when recalling the incident: &quot;Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; n&lt;U+00E3&gt;o se curvava!&quot; (&quot;Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; did not bow down!&quot;)158159 The relationship between them remained strained for years, but the admiration and respect that Pedro II had for Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o did not diminish,160 nor did the politician's loyalty towards the Emperor.161 Years later Pedro II would reveal that &quot;The Marquis of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; told me that he had forgiven any misdeed I may have committed against Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o.&quot;162
For the next four years Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o and his colleagues stood in opposition to the Liberals. During this time, they also witnessed the rise and fall of Aureliano Coutinho's &quot;Courtier Faction&quot;, which was allied to the Liberal Party. The Courtier Faction held nearly absolute sway over Brazilian politics for a couple of years. This lasted until the Emperor, fully grown and experienced, purged everyone linked to the group, including Aureliano (whose influence was destroyed after Pedro II implicitly banished him from participation in political decision-making).163 The monarch made clear that he thereafter would make his own, impartial decisions, free of the influence of others.164 From February 1844 through May 1848 the country saw four cabinets in succession, all composed of members from the Liberal Party. The inability of all four to produce any concrete results stood as testimony to their internal divisions. Progressive initiatives lay dormant, including technological innovations such as a telegraph system, railroads, and expanding primary education.165 After the last Liberal Cabinet resigned, Pedro II called upon the Party of Order, by then known simply as the &quot;Conservative Party&quot; (to &quot;preserve&quot; the order and the constitutional monarchy),166 to form a new Cabinet.167 The former regent Pedro de Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo Lima, who at that point was the chief figure among Conservatives, assumed the office of president.168 The only other politician with enough prestige to merit the position was Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o, but his quarrel with the Emperor was still a vivid memory. He would, however, exercise a tremendous influence over the Cabinet.169170
Return to power
Praieira
Unlike their rivals, the Liberals were incapable of taking turns in office.171172 The most radical Liberal faction in the province of Pernambuco, known as the Partido da Praia (&quot;Party of the Beach&quot;), openly prepared to revolt and retake power by force. Although nominally liberal, the praieiros were in reality related to the &quot;Courtier Faction&quot;173 and had as their main national leader Aureliano Coutinho.174 In a sense, the rebellion would represent the last gasp of the once-powerful &quot;Courtier Faction&quot;, which had languished, all but defunct, since 1847.175 There was no connection between the praieiros and the republicans active in the Confederation of the Equator in 1824 or in the regency during the 1830s.176 On the contrary, they always denied ever having advocated republicanism177 and alleged their main goal was to &quot;save&quot; Pedro II from the Conservatives.178  The praieiros had no popular support, and they knew that public opinion was against them&lt;U+2014&gt;the more so as it became apparent that they could put forth no coherent rationale to justify rebellion.179 They would later express shame at ever having rebelled and blamed each other for it.180 The Liberal Party itself had already been discredited nationally for having produced no noteworthy accomplishments during their tenure in power between 1844 and 1848,181 and the praieiros did not advance a political platform, other than an anti-Liberal proposal advocating the nationalization of the country's commerce: a regressive policy which harkened back to Brazil's condition when still a Portuguese colony.182 They subsequently put forward a last-minute idea for creating a new constituent assembly.183 Although the Conservative Cabinet appointed a moderate president (governor) for the province, hoping that a conciliatory measure would prevent a revolt,184 the praieiros rebelled on 7 November 1848.185186187
The rebellion had a small reach and was crushed on 2 February 1849, when the praieiros were decisively defeated after attacking Recife, the capital of Pernambuco.188189 Meanwhile, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o opposed the rebellious praieros in the Chamber of Deputies, going so far as to accuse them of diverting public funds intended to help drought victims in Pernambuco for themselves.190 He was then appointed president of the province (from 2 July 1849 until 8 May 1850) and managed to bring about true peace by restraining acts of revenge and supporting fair trials for all rebels.191 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o was so able that even the praieiros approved of his administration.192 The rebels were prosecuted and convicted, but were almost immediately pardoned by the Emperor.193 After the Praieira revolt the Liberal Party, rejected by the public for its actions, almost completely disappeared;194195 popular support strengthened for parliamentary monarchy;196 and the Conservative Party became supreme in Brazilian politics for the next decade.197
Platine War
With Brazil internally pacified, the Conservative Cabinet could turn its attention to a serious foreign threat: the Argentine dictator Don Juan Manuel de Rosas. He had aided the Tatters' separatist rebels in Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s,198199 and sought to annex that Brazilian province, as well as planning the conquests of Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, to create a dominion encompassing the territories of the old Viceroyalty of the R&lt;U+00ED&gt;o de la Plata.200 Brazil's Cabinet decided to forge alliances with other nations threatened by the dictator's ambitions201 and sent an army commanded by Luis Alves de Lima e Silva (then count, later marquis and ultimately duke of Caxias) to Uruguay, crossing the border on 4 September 1851.202 The Conservatives, along with most Brazilians, were exceptionalists who held to a view which contrasted their nation's Portuguese language, stability and parliamentary monarchy with the troubled Hispanic presidential republics which were Brazil's neighbors. Through the lens of the continuing anarchy surrounding Brazil, the support of foreign governments for republican rebellions in South America was seen as a threat to Brazil's own national cohesion and survival.203  Paulino Soares de Sousa, viscount of Uruguay and minister of Foreign Affairs,204 appointed Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o as special plenipotentiary diplomat for the Plata region.205 He and the Uruguayan envoy Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Lamas signed a treaty in Rio de Janeiro on 12 October 1851 which set territorial frontiers,206 with Uruguay abandoning claims over some disputed areas to serve as compensation for Brazilian assistance to Uruguay in the war against Argentina.207 Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o then departed for Montevideo on 23 October 1851.208 To assist on his mission, he chose Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Maria da Silva Paranhos, passing over the more experienced Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen whom he considered a &quot;proud, presumptuous and arrogant young man.&quot;209 Paranhos was a young liberal journalist who had distanced himself from the Liberal Party after it had backed the Praieira revolt. In his newspaper articles, he began to openly defend the more aggressive foreign policy championed by the Conservative Cabinet.210 The two men arrived in Montevideo for negotiations on 2 November211 and on the 21st of the same month, Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre R&lt;U+00ED&gt;os and Corrientes.212
A Brazilian division, along with Uruguayan and Argentine rebel troops, invaded Argentina. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated an army led by Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom.213214 The victory over the Argentine dictator was followed in the 1850s by a period of stability and prosperity in Brazil, approached only by Chile among the nations of South America.215 Upon his return to Brazil, the Emperor on 10 July 1852 granted Carneiro Le&lt;U+00E3&gt;o the title of Viscount of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; (after the river of the same name in the vicinity of which most of the action during the war occurred).216
Conciliation Cabinet and early death
On 6 September 1853 the Viscount of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; was appointed President of the Council of Ministers and charged with organizing a new Cabinet.217 He was at this time the main leader of the Conservative Party218 and the most influential politician in the country.219 Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; had seen both his main foes, Aureliano Coutinho and Feij&lt;U+00F3&gt;, and their political factions fall into oblivion while he rose to power. Emperor Pedro II wished to make amends for what he considered an injustice committed against Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; in 1844, and at the same time to advance his ambitious plan: the Conciliation.220221 The goal of the Conciliation was to put an end to armed conflicts between political factions (begun by Restorationists at the beginning of the 1830s, and continued by Liberals). It had become usual for parties which were ousted from power in elections to attempt to regain it by force of arms, as happened in 1842 and 1848. From that point on, political disputes were to be settled democratically in the parliament. Both parties would be required to rise above passionate partisanship and instead devote themselves to the common good of the nation.222223 
Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; took the Ministry of Finance for himself224 and invited converted Liberals to assume some of the other Cabinet portfolios. These included his prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Paranhos (Foreign ministry), Ant&lt;U+00F4&gt;nio Paulino Limpo de Abreu (Foreign ministry before Paranhos) and Lu&lt;U+00ED&gt;s Pedreira de Couto Ferraz (Empire [Interior] ministry).225 From the Conservative bloc, he selected Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Nabuco de Ara&lt;U+00FA&gt;jo (Justice ministry), Pedro de Alc&lt;U+00E2&gt;ntara Bellengarde (Navy ministry), the Marquis of Caxias (War ministry) and Jo&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Maur&lt;U+00ED&gt;cio Wanderley (Navy ministry after Bellegarde).226 The selection of former Liberals for Cabinet seats was controversial. The Liberals knew that they could not return to power through the ballot box, and many happily approved Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s policy of accepting anyone who desired to join the Conservative ranks.227228 On the other hand, traditional Conservatives (including the Viscount of Itabora&lt;U+00ED&gt;, Eus&lt;U+00E9&gt;bio de Queir&lt;U+00F3&gt;s, the Viscount of Uruguay and &lt;U+00C2&gt;ngelo Ferraz) repudiated the adoption of these newly made Conservatives, believing that these did not truly share Conservative ideals and that they were instead more interested in gaining public offices.229230 The Emperor himself was disappointed in the manner in which the &quot;conciliation&quot; was implemented by Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;.231232
Despite the mistrust, the viscount was resilient and able to triumph over reverses and obstruction.233 His Cabinet was quite successful, maintaining the national stability achieved by previous Conservative governments since 1848,234235 and allowed him to proudly affirm that &quot;past fights have ended and have been forgotten&quot;.236 Improvements throughout the country were made, including the first railroad, steamship passenger lines, sewers, and public gas illumination, as well as new incentives to promote immigration from Europe.237 In the Parliament, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; defined his government as &quot;progressive-conservative and conservative-progressive&quot;.238239 In recognition of his merits, the Emperor raised him from viscount to marquis on 2 December 1854.240 However, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;'s greatest goal was the elimination of electoral fraud, and towards that end he introduced reforms of the electoral system through the Law of Circles (Districts), which was enacted in 1855.241242243 The reform considerably diminished fraud in elections.244245
The marquis was at the height of his career when he was unexpectedly struck down by disease on 3 September 1856. The diagnosis was that he had died of a &quot;pernicious fever&quot;,246247 which may have been yellow fever248 or hepatitis aggravated by pneumonia.249 In a fever-induced delirium, Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; believed himself to be delivering a speech to the Senate. His last words were: &quot;Skepticism ... the noble senator ... fatherland ... freedom.&quot;250 Pedro II lamented the death of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; saying that &quot;I can see no one else possessed of the energy with which the late marquis was endowed, and joined to it uncommon talents, even if they were unpolished.&quot;251 His Cabinet survived him, albeit with Caxias as president,252 until 4 May 1857.253
Legacy
The death of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; had a profound impact on both the government and the Brazilian people.254 He was honored with a grand funeral procession attended by a huge crowd, a rare event in Brazil at the time.255 Writer Joaquim Manuel de Macedo said that &quot;the marquis of Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; was a politician well suited to the great State crises, and to a time of most difficult and contentious political strife.&quot;256 Joaquim Nabuco, who viewed him a statesman, summarized his character as a man &quot;made not only to dominate, but also to lead.&quot;257 Euclides da Cunha, who also called him a statesman, calls him a &quot;great man&quot; who &quot;demarcates a decisive stretch in our [Brazilian] Constitutional History&quot;.258
Historian Maur&lt;U+00ED&gt;lio de Gouveia wrote: &quot;[Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;] reveals himself to posterity as an example of tenacity, energy, patriotism and honor&quot;.259 To historian Heitor Lyra, the marquis was one of the pillars responsible for the political stability of Pedro II's reign. His policy of &quot;conciliation&quot; ended a period of rebellions, and led to the appearance of a new generation of monarchist politicians raised &quot;in the school of tolerance, mutual respect and public interest&quot;, which produced &quot;the constitutional environment where the two great [political] parties of the Monarchy would take turns [in power] without excluding each other.&quot;260 Historian Aldo Janotti considered Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt;, alongside Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, as being responsible for the maintenance of Brazilian unity and preventing its territorial dismemberment.261

Notes
Pedro I had departed for Europe to reclaim the throne of his daughter Maria II, Queen of Portugal, which had been usurped by his own brother Miguel I.
Unlike its European counterparts, the Brazilian nobility, although lifelong, was not hereditary and had no financial support, nor was it considered by the Constitution to be a different social class. 273 Honor and titles were &quot;conferred upon individuals in recompense for state or charitable services, not in recognition of illustrious ancestry.&quot;274
