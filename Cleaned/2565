There, Sting defeated Angle to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.5 On the October 25 episode of Impact!, with help from Nash, Angle defeated Sting to win back the title. Due to the controversial circumstances, Cornette announced that Angle would defend the title in a tag team match, in which the person that got the pinfall or submission would win the title.6

They were unsuccessful at defeating the Steiners as The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin; MCMG) interfered and helped the Steiners win the match.15 On the October 18 episode of Impact!, Team 3D attacked MCMG during their match in The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament, injuring them in the plot, which lead to a spot being vacant. Afterwards, they stated they were going to destroy the X Division, for which MCMG belonged.16 On the November 1 episode of Impact!, MCMG returned from injury and attacked Team 3D.
