 Umm Qais () is a town in Jordan located on the site of the ruined Hellenistic-Roman city of Gadara (, gad&lt;U+00B4&gt;a-ra or &lt;U+05D2&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;, ga-der) , (Greek: &lt;U+0393&gt;&lt;U+03AC&gt;&lt;U+03B4&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;, also transliterated G&lt;U+00E1&gt;dara). The town was also called Antiochia or Antiochia Semiramis (Greek: &lt;U+0391&gt;&lt;U+03BD&gt;&lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03CC&gt;&lt;U+03C7&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03B9&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt; &lt;U+03C4&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt; &lt;U+03A3&gt;&lt;U+03B5&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03AF&gt;&lt;U+03C1&gt;&lt;U+03B1&gt;&lt;U+03BC&gt;&lt;U+03B7&gt;&lt;U+03C2&gt;) and Seleucia. Gadara was a semi-autonomous city of the Roman Decapolis.
History
The name Gadara appears to be Semitic. It is probably derived from the Hebrew gader (&lt;U+05D2&gt;&lt;U+05D3&gt;&lt;U+05E8&gt;), meaning &quot;fence&quot; or &quot;border&quot;. It is still heard in Jed&lt;U+016B&gt;r, which is associated with the ancient rock tombs, with sarcophagi, to the east of the present ruins. These tombs are closed by carved stone doors, and are used as storehouses for grain, and also as dwellings by the inhabitants. The place is not mentioned till later times.  It was taken by Antiochus the Great when in 218 BC he first invaded Palestine1. At this time, the city was renamed Antiochia Semiramis (or Antiochia for short) and Seleucia2. Alexander Jannaeus invaded the place, and reduced it to ruins after a ten months' siege3. Pompey is said to have restored it, in 63 BC4; from which time it appears to have declined in Jewish governance. He gave it a free constitution. From this date the era of the city was reckoned. It was the seat of one of the councils instituted by Gabinius for the government of the Jews5. It was given by Augustus to Herod the Great in 30 BC6. The Roman emperor would not listen to the accusations from the inhabitants about Herod's oppressive conduct7.
After Herod's death it was joined to the province of Syria (4 BC)8. At the beginning of the Jewish revolt in 66 CE, the country around Gadara was laid waste9. The Gadarenes captured some of the boldest of the Jews, of whom several were put to death, and others imprisoned10. Some in the city surrendered themselves to Vespasian, who placed a garrison there11. It continued to be a great and important city during Byzantine Christian times, and was long the seat of a bishop12. With the conquest of the Arabs, following the Battle of Yarmouk in 636, it came under Muslim rule. It was largely destroyed by an earthquake around 747 AD, and abandoned as a city.
Identification and description
Gadara was one of the Ten Cities of the Decapolis.  Umm Qais answers the description given of Gadara by ancient writers. It was a strong fortress (Ant., XIII, iii, 3), near the Hieromax - i.e. Yarmuk (Pliny the Elder N H, xvi) - east of Tiberias and Scythopolis, on the top of a hill, 3 Roman miles from hot springs and baths called Amatha, to the north on the banks of the Hieromax. The narrow ridge on which the ruins lie extends east toward the Jordan from the uplands of Gilead, with the deep gorge of Wadi Yarmouk - Hieromax - on the north, and Wadi Arab on the south. The ridge drops gradually to the East, but falls steeply on the other three sides, so that the position was one of great strategic value and strength. The ancient walls may be traced in almost their entire circuit of 3 km. One of the great Roman roads ran eastward to Ḍer&lt;U+201B&gt;ah; and an aqueduct has been traced to the pool of Ḳhab, about 20 miles to the north of Ḍer&lt;U+201B&gt;ah. The ruins include those of two theaters, a temple, a basilica, and many important buildings, telling of a once great and splendid city. A paved street, with double colonnade, ran from east to west. The ruts worn in the pavement by the chariot wheels are still to be seen.
That there was a second Gadara seems certain, and it may be intended in some of the passages referred to above. It is probably represented by the modern Jed&lt;U+016B&gt;r, not far from es-Salṭ (Buhl, Geographic des alten Palastina, 255; Guthe). Josephus gives Pella as the northern boundary of Peraea (BJ, III, iii, 3). This would exclude Gadara on the Hieromax. The southern city, therefore, should be understood as &quot;the capital of Peraea&quot; in BJ, IV; vii, 3. 
Country of the Gadarenes
This city is not named in Scripture, but the territory belonging to it is spoken of as , ch&lt;U+014D&gt;&lt;U+0307&gt;ra t&lt;U+014D&gt;&lt;U+0307&gt;n Gadar&lt;U+0113&gt;n&lt;U+014D&gt;&lt;U+0307&gt;n, &lt;U+201C&gt;country of the Gadarenes&lt;U+201D&gt; (Matthew 8:28). In the parallel passages (Mark 5:1; Luke 8:26, Luke 8:37) is written: , ch&lt;U+014D&gt;&lt;U+0307&gt;ra t&lt;U+014D&gt;&lt;U+0307&gt;n Geras&lt;U+0113&gt;n&lt;U+014D&gt;&lt;U+0307&gt;n (&quot;country of the Gerasenes&lt;U+201D&gt;). Scholars debate which is the correct site of the miracle and modern translations have multiple readings of the Gospels. However, the earliest texts are very clear as to the original version of the synoptic Gospels. Upon close observation of the earliest Greek manuscripts, the Alexandrian texts, the original reading of Matthew is &quot;in the region of the Gadarenes&quot;, and the original text of Mark and Luke is &lt;U+201C&gt;in the country of the Gerasenes&lt;U+201D&gt;. The earliest Greek manuscripts of Matthew, which precede the textual alteration made by Origen, locate the miracle to be within the &lt;U+201C&gt;country of the Gadarenes&lt;U+201D&gt; (Matt. 8:28). The Greek city of Gadara, was considered to belong to the larger region of Gerasa, though it still retained some local autonomy (Weber 1989: 9).
The miracle
A controversy exists regarding the site found in all three of the synoptic Gospels, where Jesus healed the demoniacs and cast the demons into a herd of swine which ran into the sea of Galilee. The Gospel accounts record that Jesus, along with his disciples, stepped upon the shore and &lt;U+201C&gt;immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man&lt;U+201D&gt; possessed by demons named Legion  (Mark 5:2). Jesus then spoke to the demons and demanded them to depart, sending them into a nearby &lt;U+201C&gt;herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain&lt;U+201D&gt; (Luke 8:32). The possessed pigs, &lt;U+201C&gt;ran violently down the steep place into the sea&lt;U+201D&gt; and &lt;U+201C&gt;those who kept them fled and went away into the city&lt;U+201D&gt; (Matt. 8:32-33). Based upon the Gospel accounts, the location of the miracle had to have a nearby port, tombs for the men to live in, an area for pigs to graze, a nearby city to which the men could flee, and most importantly, a steep bank for the herd to rush down.  The problem that has yet to be dealt with however is the site&lt;U+2019&gt;s topography. Origen initially rejected Gadara for its lack of high ridges and steep slopes down which the pigs &lt;U+201C&gt;ran violently down into the sea&lt;U+201D&gt; (Matt 8:32). Above the port there are multiple hills which could potentially match up with the biblical account. The most likely site is found at the end of a chain of hills that has a bank descending into the sea. The bank is the modern site of Tell es S&lt;U+2019&gt;alib located near the New Testament Gadaran suburb of es-Samrah (Laney 1977: 141). A visual representation of the location of this tell can be seen in Mendel Nun&lt;U+2019&gt;s work The Land of the Gadarenes (1989: 5). Although this tell may not have had as steep a slope as that found at Kursi, it does have a hill that runs into the sea and could accommodate a &lt;U+201C&gt;large herd of swine numbering about 2,000&lt;U+201D&gt; (Mark 5:11). In addition to the slope, other features of the site make it match up well with the biblical account of the miracle. In excavations by B. De Vries completed in 1973, a Roman tomb from the time of Jesus was found in a valley nearby es-Samrah (Holm-Nielson 1992: 867). This could account for the tombs in which the demoniacs lived. Also, there is needed a nearby site where the swine would have grazed and &lt;U+201C&gt;the groves of oak trees on the plateau above would have provided the acorns they favored&lt;U+201D&gt; (Walking in their Sandals: 2). Thus, the site of Gadara can align both textually and geographically with the biblical account of the demoniacs and the herd of swine.
The ancient city of Gadara is represented today by the ruins at Umm Qais on the heights south of el-H&amp;#803;ummeh - the hot springs in the Yarmouk valley and about 6 miles Southeast of the Sea of Galilee. It may be taken as certain that the jurisdiction of Gadara, as the chief city in these regions, extended over the country East of the Sea, including the lands of the subordinate town, Gerasa. The figure of a ship frequently appears on its coins: conclusive proof that its territory reached the sea. Josephus also makes reference to the territory of Gadara &lt;U+201C&gt;which lay on the frontiers of Tiberius and formed the eastern boundary of Galilee,&lt;U+201D&gt; again placing the region of Gadara along the coast of the Sea of Galilee (Laney 1977: 134). The place might therefore be called with propriety, either &lt;U+201C&gt;land of the Gadarenes&lt;U+201D&gt;, with reference to the local center, or &lt;U+201C&gt;land of the Gerasenes&lt;U+201D&gt;, with reference to the superior city.

App., 11).)
