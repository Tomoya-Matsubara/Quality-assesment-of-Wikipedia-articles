The Rheinmetall  gun is a smoothbore tank gun designed and produced by the German Rheinmetall-DeTec AG company. It was developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats. With production beginning in 1974, the first version of the gun, known as the L/44, was used on the German Leopard 2, and was soon exported to be used on tanks such as the American M1 Abrams and the Israeli Merkava tanks. It has also been exported to South Korea and Japan, as well as nations which have procured the Leopard 2 and the M1 Abrams. Rheinmetall's  L/44 tank gun has a length of , while the gun system weighs approximately . However, by 1990 the L/44 was not considered powerful enough to deal with modernized Soviet armor, such as the T-80B, which stimulated an effort by Rheinmetall to develop a better main armament. This first revolved around a  tank gun, but later turned into a compromise which led to the development of an advanced  gun.
This gun was the L/55, based on the same internal geometry as the L/44 and installed in the same breech and mount. The L/55 is  longer, allowing for an increase in muzzle velocity for ammunition being fired through it. The fact that it retains the same barrel geometry allows the L/55 to fire the same ammunition as the L/44. This gun was retrofitted into German and Dutch Leopard 2s, and chosen as the main gun of the Spanish Leopard 2E and Greek Leopard 2HEL. The L/55 was chosen as the armament of the new South Korean K2 main battle tank, and has been tested on the British Challenger 2, as a potential replacement to the existing  rifled gun.
A variety of ammunition has been developed for use by tanks armed with Rheinmetall's tank gun. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and chemical energy anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a wide range of new anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions, giving tanks armed with Rheinmetall's tank gun greater versatility on the modern battlefield. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both enemy armor and enemy combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition, which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile when fired.
Background
thumb|left|Prototype of the Leopard 2 Worried about the ability of the existing NATO L7  tank gun to penetrate new Soviet armor, Rheinmetall began development of a new tank gun in 1964.1 The first instance of a larger Soviet tank gun was witnessed on the chassis of a modified T-55 in 1961.2 In 1965, the Soviet Union's T-62 made its first public appearance, armed with a  smoothbore tank gun.3 The Soviet decision to increase the power of its tank's main armament had come when, in the early 1960s, an Iranian tank commander defected over the Soviet border in a brand-new M60 Patton tank, which was armed with the British Royal Ordnance L7.4 Despite the introduction of the T-62, in 1969 their T-64 tank was rearmed with a new  tank gun,5 while in 1972 Nizhny Tagil began production of the T-72 tank, armed with the  tank gun as well.6 For example, at the fighting at Sultan Yakoub, during the 1982 Lebanon War, the Israeli government claimed to have destroyed 9 Syrian T-72s with the Merkava II main battle tank, armed with an Israeli production version of the American M68  tank gun (which in turn was based on the British L7).7 Whether or not true, the Soviets test fired a number of Israeli M111 Hetz armor piercing discarding sabots at Kubinka, finding the  round was able to perforate the T-72's glacis plate, but not its turret armor.8 In response, the Soviets developed the T-72M1.9 This led Israel to opt for a  tank gun during the development process of the Merkava III main battle tank.10 This case is similar to the American decision to replace the M68  tank gun with Rheinmetall's  gun in 1976; the introduction of the T-64A had caused uncertainty within the armor community as to whether or not the new ammunition designed for the existing gun caliber could effectively deal with the new Soviet tank threat.11
In 1963, Germany and the United States had already embarked on a joint&lt;U+2013&gt;tank program, known as the MBT-70. The new tank featured a three-man crew, with the driver in the turret, an automatic loader for the main gun, a  coaxial autocannon, an active hydropneumatic suspension and spaced armor on the glacis plate and the front turret.12 The new tank concept also showcased an improved tank armament; this was a  missile-launching main gun, designed to fire the MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank missile.13 However, the German Army was interested in a tank gun which could fire conventional ammunition. Although there were attempts to modify the  tank gun to do so, the process proved extremely difficult, and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall  tank gun instead.14

In 1967, the German Ministry of Defense decided to re-open a Leopard 1 improvement program, known as the Vergoldeter Leopard (Gilded Leopard), later renamed the Keiler (Wild Boar). Krauss-Maffei was chosen as the contractor, and two prototypes were developed in 1969 and 1970.15 This program grew into the Leopard 2, and the first prototype of the new tank was delivered in 1972, equipped with a  smoothbore main gun. Between 1972 and 1975 a total of 17 prototypes were developed.16 Simultaneously, the new  tank gun's ten year development effort, which had begun in 1964, ended in 1974.17 Ten of the 17 turrets built were equipped with the  smoothbore gun, while the other seven were equipped with the larger  tank gun.18 Another program aimed to mount the  missile-gun was also developed, in an attempt to save components from the MBT-70, but in 1971 the program was ended for economic reasons.19 Instead, the Germans opted for Rheinmetall's  L/44 smoothbore tank gun.20
Design features
With a caliber of , and a caliber length of 44, Rheinmetall's L44 tank gun has a length of .21 The gun's barrel weighs ,22 and on the M1 Abrams the gun mount weighs .23, while the new barrel (L55) is 55 calibers long, increasing the length by . The bore evacuator and the gun's thermal sleeve, designed to regulate the temperature of the barrel, are fabricated out of glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life.24 Originally, the tank gun had a barrel life of anywhere between 400&lt;U+2013&gt;500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average barrel life has decreased to 260 rounds. In some cases, barrels have had to be replaced after only 50 fired projectiles.25 The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.26

Production of the German Leopard 2 and the new  tank gun began in 1979, fulfilling an order for the German Army.27 Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with a  main gun,28 the United States Army had planned to outfit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date;29 therefore, the tank's turret had been designed to accept a larger  gun.30 The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 198531 The gun, known as the M256, was based on the L/44 tank gun, although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue.32 In the 1980s, the Israeli Army began to develop the Merkava III main battle tank; this tank would introduce a new  tank gun, to replace the M68  gun on the Merkava I and Merkava II.33 Originally planned to be a licensed production version of the American M256,34 the gun was modified and manufactured in Israel as the MG251;35 the Israeli gun retains the inner geometry of the barrel to allow commonality with German and American ammunition.36 A version of the gun is in production to arm the Sabra modification of Turkish M60 Patton tanks,37 named the MG253.38 An improved version of the Israeli tank gun was introduced with the Merkava IV, giving the gun the ability to survive higher barrel pressures, which in turn allows increased muzzle velocity for kinetic energy penetrators.3940 Other tanks armed with licensed produced versions of Rheinmetall's gun include Japan's Type 9041 and South Korea's K1A1.42
Rheinmetall L55 120mm
The appearance of new Soviet tanks during the late 1970s and early 1980s, such as the T-80B, demanded the development of new technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor.43 Apart from increased firepower,44 the T-80B was protected by a new composite ceramic armor.45 The T-72 also went through a modernization program, in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T-80B. In 1985, a new version entered production, known as the T-72B, showcasing a new laminate armor protection system. The turret armor of the T-72B surpassed the T-80B's in protection, and was designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles.46
Two Leopard 2A6 of the German Army with L55
The German government began the development of the Leopard 3, although this was canceled after the fall of the Soviet Union.47 On 29 October 1991, the governments of Switzerland, Netherlands and Germany agreed to cooperate in the development of a modernization program for the Leopard 2. Part of this program included the introduction of a longer  tank gun,48 a cheaper alternative to a brand new tank gun,49 increasing the maximum range of the gun by an estimated . Although the gun is longer, allowing for a higher peak pressure from the propellant, the geometry remains the same, allowing the gun to fire the same ammunition as that fired from the shorter caliber version of the cannon.50 The longer barrel allows ammunition to attain higher velocities; for example, with new kinetic energy penetrators ammunition can reach velocities of around .51 The new barrel weighs .52
The longer tank gun has been retrofitted into the Leopard 2, into a model known as the Leopard 2A6.53 Both the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard 2HEL, as derivatives of the Leopard 2A6, use the 55 caliber long tank gun.54
Ammunition
The American M829 armor piercing sabot
A variety of rounds have been developed for Rheinmetall's tank gun. For example, a long line of armor piercing discarding sabots was developed by Rheinmetall. Originally, the Leopard 2 was outfitted with the DM-23 kinetic energy penetrator,55 based on the Israeli M111 Hetz.56 The DM23 was eventually replaced by the DM33, which was also adopted by Japan, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland. The DM43 is a further development of this round, co-developed between Germany and France. The United States adopted the round and manufactured it as the M829. The DM33 has a three-part aluminum sabot and a two-part tungsten penetrator, and is said to be able to penetrate  of steel armor at a range of .57 The introduction of the longer barrel came hand in hand with the introduction of a new kinetic energy penetrator, the DM53. With a muzzle velocity of between 58 and , the projectile has an engagement range of up to .59 A further development, called the DM63, improved upon the round by introducing a new temperature independent propellant, which allows the propellant to have a constant pattern of expansion between ambient temperatures (inside the gun barrel) of anywhere between  and . The new propellant powders, known as surface coated double base (SCDB) propellants, allow the DM63 to be used in a wide variety of climates without a negative impact on the projectile's performance.60 Apart from Germany, the new ammunition has been accepted into service with the Dutch and Swiss armies.61
The United States developed a number of kinetic energy penetrators, based on the M829.62 An immediate improvement, known as the M829A1, was dubbed the &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; after its combat performance, during the Gulf War, against Iraqi T-55s, T-62s and T-72s.63 The M829 series centers around the depleted uranium penetrator, designed to penetrate enemy armor through kinetic energy and to shatter inside the turret, thereby damaging as much as possible within the confinement of the tank.64 In 1998, the United States military introduced the M829A2, which has an improved depleted uranium penetrator.65 In 2002, production of the M829A3 began, which is said to be able to defeat the latest versions of Russian explosive reactive armor.66
Both Germany and the United States have developed a number of other rounds. These include the German DM12 multipurpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), based on the technology in a high explosive anti-tank warhead.67 However, it's been found that the DM12's armor killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets.68 The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830.69 This was later developed into the M830A1 which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters.70 The M1 Abrams can make use of the M1028 canister round, which is an antipersonnel munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls.71 The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, and therefore explodes inside the target and causes more damage.72
The Israeli Army introduced a new round, known as the Laser Homing Anti-Tank (LAHAT) projectile.73 Using a semi-active laser homing guidance method, the LAHAT can be guided by the tank's crew or by teams on the ground, while the missile's trajectory can be chosen between top attack (to defeat enemy armor) and direct attack (to engage enemy helicopters). Furthermore, the missile can be fired by both  and  tank guns.74 The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2, and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users.75 Israeli Merkavas make use of a round known as the APAM, which is an anti-personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage. Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate enemy body armor.76
Poland has also introduced a series of projectiles for Rheinmetall's tank gun, including an armor piercing penetrator target practice round (APFSDS-T-TP), a high explosive round and a high explosive target practice (HE-TP) projectile. The ammunition is manufactured by Zaklady Produkcji Specjalnej Sp..77
Operators
Due to tank sales, Rheinmetall's L/44 tank gun has been manufactured for other nations. For example, the Leopard 2, armed with the 44 caliber long gun, has been sold to the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Denmark, amongst others78. Egypt manufactured 700&lt;U+2013&gt;800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005,79 while in 2008 Egypt requested permission to build another 125 tanks; the M256 main guns, arming the tanks, were manufactured by General Dynamics.80 The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia,81 while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.82
