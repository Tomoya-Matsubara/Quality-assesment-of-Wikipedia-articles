&quot;That Is All&quot; is a song by English musician George Harrison released as the final track of his 1973 album Living in the Material World. A slow, heavily orchestrated ballad, it is one of many Harrison love songs that appear to be directed at either a woman or a deity. Harrison wrote and recorded the song during the height of his public devotion to Hinduism; on release, Rolling Stone described its lyrics as &quot;a sort of Hindu In Paradisium&quot;.1
Recording for &quot;That Is All&quot; took place in London in late 1972, following a period when Harrison's attention had been centred on completing the international aid project begun the previous year with the Concert for Bangladesh. The other musicians on the track include keyboard players Gary Wright, whose fledgling solo career Harrison actively supported during the early 1970s, and Nicky Hopkins. The song's orchestral and choral arrangements were provided by John Barham, who had also worked on Harrison's album All Things Must Pass and Wright's Footprint. &quot;That Is All&quot; has been covered by singers Andy Williams and Harry Nilsson.
Background
As with all the songs on his 1973 album Living in the Material World except for &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;,2 George Harrison wrote &quot;That Is All&quot; over 1971&lt;U+2013&gt;72,3 a period marked by both his heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality45 and his commitment to providing humanitarian aid for the refugees of the Bangladesh Liberation War.67 With his own career taking second place to the latter endeavour, following the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971,8 Harrison continued to assist American musician Gary Wright in establishing himself as a solo artist,910 when A&amp;M Records released Wright's album Footprint in November that year.1112 One of the album's tracks was &quot;Love to Survive&quot;, which was orchestrated by Harrison's All Things Must Pass arranger, John Barham.13 According to Barham, &quot;musically there was a strong rapport&quot; between himself, Harrison and Wright at this time, while author Simon Leng cites &quot;Love to Survive&quot; as a song that influenced Harrison's composition &quot;That Is All&quot;.14
In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison comments only briefly on &quot;That Is All&quot;, saying: &quot;The melody came to me and I then had to think of lyrics. That's all.&quot;15 Commentators have remarked on the fact that, like many other Harrison compositions &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;What Is Life&quot;,16 &quot;Don't Let Me Wait Too Long&quot;, &quot;Learning How to Love You&quot; and &quot;Your Love Is Forever&quot; among them1718 &lt;U+2013&gt; it serves as both a conventional love song to a woman and a declaration of devotion to God.1920 Harrison said in a 1976 interview: &quot;I think all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see.&quot;21
Composition
The song is in the musical key of A.22 Leng identifies the composition as a development of Harrison's favoured &quot;Something&quot; ballad style.23 A number of &quot;characteristic&quot; Harrison musical devices are found in &quot;That Is All&quot;, Leng continues &lt;U+2013&gt; such as a melody that rises by a half step with each line, and an A minor chord sharpened to an augmented triad &quot;to create drama&quot;.24
Author Ian Inglis describes the song's melody as &quot;romantic&quot;. Referring to its status as the last track on Living in the Material World, he also comments on the appropriateness of Harrison's opening words:25 &quot;That is all I want to say&quot;.26 Inglis writes that Harrison goes on to state both &quot;[what] he wants to do for his lover&quot; and &quot;what he hopes for in return&quot;,27 in the respective lines &quot;To try to love you more&quot; and &quot;A smile when I feel blue&quot;.28
Leng considers that the song's middle eight echoes the same &quot;tongue-tied difficulty&quot; that Harrison had first introduced in his 1966 composition &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot;:29
During this section, the change from a regular 4/4 time signature to 3/8 provides, in Leng's words, a &quot;stuttering, hesitant syntax&quot; that reflects the message of the lyrics.30 On release, the same lyrics were identified by Rolling Stone reviewer Stephen Holden as &quot;a sort of Hindu In Paradisium&quot;.31Stephen Holden, &quot;George Harrison, Living in the Material World&quot;, Rolling Stone, 19 July 1973 (retrieved 24 July 2012).

Recording
The recording sessions for Living in the Material World began in October 197232 after Harrison had spent part of the summer staying with Wright in Portugal.3334 Although Harrison had intended to co-produce the album with Phil Spector as before, he decided to work without him,35 partly as a result of Spector's erratic behaviour at the start of the sessions.3637 Harrison employed elements of Spector's signature production style,38 but with a degree of subtlety in comparison to the big sound on All Things Must Pass.3940John Metzger, &quot;George Harrison Living in the Material World&quot;, The Music Box, vol. 13 (11), November 2006 (retrieved 17 July 2012). In his 2014 autobiography, Wright says that Spector's dismissal was &quot;the right move&quot;; he describes Material World as his favourite Harrison album and &quot;a beautiful masterpiece showing more of him &lt;U+2013&gt; without Phil Spector's production&quot;.41 Aside from Harrison and Wright, the musicians on &quot;That Is All&quot; were Nicky Hopkins (on piano), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums).42
As on &quot;Who Can See It&quot;, another of the album's ballads, Harrison recorded &quot;That Is All&quot; using a Leslie rotary effect on his electric guitar.43 This sound opens the song, after which the rhythm section joins in for an extended instrumental introduction that sees first Wright's electric piano and then Hopkins' piano interweave as second and third voices around Harrison's guitar &lt;U+2013&gt; an example of an album-wide production aesthetic that, in Robert Rodriguez's words, lets &quot;instruments sparkle&quot; and allows &quot;breathing space&quot;.44 Following the second verse, Wright's45 overdubbed, &quot;Piggies&quot;-style harpsichord appears along with John Barham's strings and choir.46 The early calm musical surroundings are broken only in the middle eight, with the arrival of brass orchestration (Barham-arranged again), after which, during the song's third verse, the string section and &quot;heavenly&quot; choir return with added urgency, as if to &quot;intensify the already fervid romanticism through expanded production&quot;, as Holden opined.47
Harrison overdubbed a brief, slide-guitar solo over part of the second middle-eight section, most probably in January or February 1973.48 Barham's contributions were added in early March,49 and those London sessions marked the last time that Harrison would work with the arranger during the 1970s. Their collaborations had taken in Harrison's Wonderwall Music, All Things Must Pass and Living in the Material World albums, as well as Apple projects for Jackie Lomax, Billy Preston and Radha Krishna Temple (London).50
Release and reception
Apple Records issued Living in the Material World at the end of May 1973, or late June in Britain,51 with &quot;That Is All&quot; sequenced to follow &quot;The Day the World Gets 'Round&quot;.52 Writing in Melody Maker, Michael Watts described the album as &quot;Harrison's personal statement&quot; documenting his journey towards &quot;a spiritual goal which for the first time he has been able to define&quot;.53Michael Watts, &quot;The New Harrison Album&quot;, Melody Maker, 9 June 1973, p. 3. Watts continued: &quot;now he stands as something more than an entertainer. Now he's being honest. When you've been through all the bullshit and come out the other side, that's the only thing you can be.&quot;54 In his review for Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden referred to the album's &quot;inspirationally, opulently, romantic&quot; qualities and wrote of &quot;That Is All&quot; and the preceding &quot;The Day the World Gets 'Round&quot; as being &quot;two devotional prayers whose solemn mantra-influenced melodies are barely able to sustain their lush orchestration. Yet they do, so that at the end we are left suspended in etherealityÂ ...&quot;55
In his book The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, Bruce Spizer describes &quot;That Is All&quot; as &quot;a beautiful love song written either for a woman or the Lord&quot;.56 Writing for Rough Guides, author and critic Chris Ingham similarly considers that &quot;the 'love' [Harrison is] so desperate to express&quot; in the song &quot;seems directed as much to an earthly relationship as to any God&quot;, and he cites this as an example of the &quot;restraint and, in places, considerable grace and beauty&quot; adopted by Harrison on the album.57 Among other Beatles biographers, Robert Rodriguez writes that the track &quot;sums up the journey&quot; in the same way as &quot;Hear Me Lord&quot; successfully concludes the song cycle on All Things Must Pass,58 a view shared by Elliot Huntley, who admires &quot;That Is All&quot; as a &quot;lush orchestral prayer where George really does prostrate himself at His feet&quot;.59 Reviewing the 2014 Apple Years reissue of Material World, Joe Marchese of The Second Disc highlights &quot;That Is All&quot; among songs that combine to provide the album's &quot;earnest and intensely personal, yet wholly accessible, statement&quot;.60Joe Marchese, &quot;Review: The George Harrison Remasters &lt;U+2013&gt; 'The Apple Years 1968&lt;U+2013&gt;1975'&quot;, The Second Disc, 23 September 2014 (retrieved 3 October 2014).
Cover versions
Given the song's mood and sentiment, authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter consider &quot;That Is All&quot; to have been suitable for inclusion on a Frank Sinatra album.61 While Sinatra did not record it, the song was covered by singer Andy Williams,62 who had been one of the many easy listening artists, along with Sinatra, to cover Harrison's &quot;Something&quot;.63 Featuring contributions from Hopkins, Voormann and Keltner,64 Williams' version of &quot;That Is All&quot; appeared on his 1973 album Solitaire.65William Ruhlmann, &quot;Andy Williams Solitaire&quot;, AllMusic (retrieved 11 March 2015). The recording was produced by Richard Perry, with whom Harrison worked on Ringo Starr's album Ringo in Los Angeles66 shortly after completing Living in the Material World.6768
Harry Nilsson recorded &quot;That Is All&quot; for his 1976 album ...That's the Way It Is.69 The song appears twice there, as the opening track and as a reprise to close the album.70
