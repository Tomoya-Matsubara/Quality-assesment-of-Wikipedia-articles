New York State Route 49 (NY Route 49 or NY 49) is a state highway in the U.S. state of New York. It runs from NY Route 3 east of Fulton to Interstate 790, NY Route 5, NY Route 8 and NY Route 12 in Utica. A portion of it between Rome and Utica is known as the Utica-Rome Expressway.
Route description
New York State Route 49 begins at an interchange with New York State Route 3 in Volney.1 The route begins going eastward, intersecting with New York State Route 264 just outside of Pennellville. The route crosses some local and county roads before entering Central Square, where it intersects with U.S. Route 11. It is not long after that Route 49 interchanges with Interstate 81 at Exit 32. Route 49 leaves Central Square and heads into region of Oneida Lake.2
 The highway begins to parallel the shore of Oneida Lake after the town of Constantia.3 Route 49 enters Oneida County and intersects with New York State Route 13 after Oneida Lake ends in Vienna. The highway then parallels the Erie Canal on its journey eastward. Just north of Stacy Basin, New York State Route 46 intersects and becomes concurrent with 49.4
Routes 49 and 46 head to the northeast and enter the city of Rome.5 There, New York State Route 69 becomes concurent. Route 46 turns off, and Routes 49 and 69 head to New York State Route 365. The road becomes concurrent and becomes a freeway. Route 49 leaves 365 and 69 behind and becomes known as the Utica-Rome Expressway for the rest of its length. Route 49 interchanges with New York State Route 825 first, then New York State Route 291.
Utica Area
The freeway continues eastward, entering Utica about a mile from the eastern terminus. The highway is unusual in that its westbound lanes run parallel to the Thruway to the latter's north, with the eastbound lanes to the south. Route 49 terminates at a complex interchange for New York State Route 5, New York State Route 8, New York State Route 12, and Interstate 790.6
History
Route 49 was assigned in 1926 from Central Square to Rome. The parts from Volney to Central Square and Rome to Utica were unnumbered. In 1930, Route 49 was extended over both alignments and then stretched from Volney to Utica.7 Route 49 was later realigned onto the Utica-Rome Expressway.
