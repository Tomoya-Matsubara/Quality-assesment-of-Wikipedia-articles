  Prospect High School, or Prospect, is a public four-year high school located in Mt. Prospect, Illinois, a northwest suburb of Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. It is part of Township High School District 214, which also includes Buffalo Grove High School, Elk Grove High School, John Hersey High School, Rolling Meadows High School, and Wheeling High School.
History
Prospect was opened in 1957 as a freshman campus for the now-defunct Arlington High School. By the next school year, the district had grown enough that Prospect was turned into a full four-year school.1
In August 1995, on only the second day of the new school year, the school's field house suffered a fire. The cause of the fire was nothing short of a freak accident. Thick mats used by the track team (mostly the mats for high jump) had been out in the blistering sun on the previous day. The mats, with the heat of the sun still within them, were placed above a loft in the field house. One of the mats rested against a frayed electrical cord. The heat of the mat combined with the frayed wiring started the fire. The scoreboard and school record plaques were melted in the fire, though the most damage came from the water damage from the fire hoses. The field house was closed off for most of the 1995-1996 school year. The field house re-opened with a much-needed lighting improvement, better basketball floor, and new paint.
The most recent additions to the school have been a library in 2002, a new art wing in 2003, and a new cafeteria in 2004. As of 2007, work is being done to remove asbestos from the older parts of the building.
Academics
In 2005, Prospect had an average composite ACT score of 23.5, and graduated 93.0% of its senior class. Prospect has made Adequate Yearly Progress on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, a state test used for the No Child Left Behind Act.1

Controversies
Jason Krigas, 36, was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison for sexually abusing a female student in September of 2006. Krigas was fired by the school in 2005. Krigas was a well-respected teacher credited with building the once-small Prospect High School choir into an award-winning powerhouse prior to his conviction.
In October of 2006 The Illinois Dept. of Children and Family Services (DCFS) began investigating allegations of abuse against former Prospect High School administrator David J. Good. That investigation ended in December 2006, with DCFS officials stating that all allegations against Good were unfounded. Good was the former assistant principal of activities at Prospect. He resigned from his job on October 12, 2006 after a leave of absence that had begun on September 22, 2006.
