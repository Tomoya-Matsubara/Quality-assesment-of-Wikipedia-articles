Don Andrea Santoro was a Catholic priest who was murdered on February 5, 2006 at the Santa Maria Church in Trabzon, Turkey, where he served as a member of the Catholic church's Fidei donum missionary program. A 16-year-old high school student was arrested two days later carrying a 9mm pistol. The student told police he had been influenced by the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.1
At Don Santoro's funeral at the Basilica of St. John Lateran, His Eminence, Camillo Cardinal Ruini, the vicar of the Diocese of Rome, has mentioned in his homily that the possible beatification process for Don Santoro may be opened after February 2011.
