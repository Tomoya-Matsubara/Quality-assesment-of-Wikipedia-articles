Providence Chapel is a former Calvinistic Baptist place of worship in the village of Hadlow Down in Wealden, one of six local government districts in the English county of East Sussex. Although built in 1849, the chapel can trace its origins to the founding in 1824 of an Independent Baptist place of worship in the village (pre-dating the local Anglican church by 12 years). The new building was in religious use for nearly 150 years, but storm damage led to its closure and conversion into flats in 1993&lt;U+2014&gt;although its former graveyard survives. The chapel is a Grade II Listed building.
History
The village of Hadlow Down is situated on high ground in the Sussex Weald between Buxted ( to the west) and Heathfield.12 Its first Anglican church, dedicated to St Mark, was built in 1836,3 and a parish was created from parts of Buxted and Mayfield parishes the following year.4 The first place of worship in the village was, however, founded 12 years earlier. In 1824, Henry Smith&lt;U+2014&gt;a local builder and Wesleyan Methodist&lt;U+2014&gt;built an independent nonconformist chapel for the use of local Dissenters, principally Baptists.56 In 1849, it was replaced by the present building. It was registered for marriages on 26 January 1876,7 and its denomination was recorded as &quot;Calvinistic Baptist&quot; in 1882.8
The chapel was still used for worship until the late 20th century, but it was severely damaged in the devastating Great Storm of 1987. It closed soon after this9 and was converted into a house in 1996.10
Providence Chapel was designated a Grade II Listed building on 31 December 1982.11
