Krohn Air AS is a virtual, regional airline which flies from Molde Airport, &lt;U+00C5&gt;r&lt;U+00F8&gt; to Trondheim Airport, V&lt;U+00E6&gt;rnes in Norway. The airline has a British Aerospace Jetstream 32, which is operated by Helitrans. The airline aims at the business segment, with early morning departures from Molde and four daily round trips.
The airline was established in 2010, after Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) terminated its service between Molde and Trondheim. Originally services were provided using a Dornier Do 328 operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia. Later in that year, Krohn Air acquired a Jetstream 32 and started flights from Molde to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola, but these services did not have sufficient patronage and were later terminated. By 2011, the airceaft operation was transferred to Helitrans.
History
From 31 January 2010, Scandinavian Airlines terminated its service from Molde to Trondheim. Krohn Air started operations 3 February 2010 on the same route, using a Dornier Do 328 wet leased from Sun Air of Scandinavia. The airline was established and fully owned by Claus Krohn, a local businessman, who was 76 years old at the time.12 SAS stated in 2011 that they did not regret closing the route, as with the size of aircraft they operated would need in excess of 20,000 passengers per year on the route, while Krohn Air could survive with less because they used smaller aircraft.3
On 28 June, the Scandinavian Airlines route from Molde to Bergen was taken over by Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e. However, while Scandinavian Airlines previously flew from Molde at 06:45, Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e's first flight departed at 08:55. Krohn Air stated that it saw this as a market opportunity to provide a business service from Molde to Bergen. Krohn Air had just bought a Jetstream 32 from Sun-Air, which it planned to use on a new route from Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget to Trondheim. However, after Wider&lt;U+00F8&gt;e stated that it would start that route in 2011, Krohn Air changed their plans and announced that the aircraft would instead be used on the route from Molde to Bergen.4 The Bergen service was started on 31 August.5 On 7 September, the airline announced it would start services from Molde to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 13 August.6 Because there were few passengers, the services to Bergen and Stavanger were terminated from 19 November 2010.7
Krohn Air bought both aircraft from Sun Air, but later decided that they would lease aircraft. The Dornier was sold back to Sun Air, whilst the Jetstream was sold to Helitrans, who took over operation of the route. However, there arose a disagreement between Krohn Air and Sun Air regarding the price of the Dornier, which is to be settled in court.8 In 2010, the airline transported 14,000 people and had a revenue of 17 million Norwegian krone, allowing Krohn Air to break even.9 On 14 February 2011, the company increased the service from Molde to Trondheim from two to four daily services in each direction, from Monday through Thursday.10
