Arne Cheyenne Johnson is a Connecticut resident who was convicted of first-degree manslaughter of his landlord Alan Bono on November 24th, 1981.1 The trail attracted media attention from around the world, becoming known as the Demon Murder Trail, and was the first known case in the United States of a lawyer claiming his client was innocent due to possession by the Devil.23
Events preceding the attack
On July 3rd, 1980, Arne Johnson's fiancee, Debbie Glatzel, claims to have discovered that her youngest brother David woke sobbing, sayng that he had a vision of an &quot;awful beast&quot;, describing it as &quot;a man with big black eyes, a thin face with animal features and jagged teeth, pointed ears, horns and hoofs&quot;, and saying it had warned him to &quot;Beware&quot;.4 As his visions persisted, Debbie requested that Johnson come and stay at her families home.5 A catholic priest came to their house and blessed it, but to seemingly no effect on David. Visions began to occur in the daytime soon afterwords, in the form of an old man with a white beard, wearing a flannel shirt and jeans.6 The family then called upon demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren of Monroe, Connecticut to assist. Lorraine, who claims to be clairvoyant, stated that she saw a black, misty form next to David, indicating a malevolent presence, and that David complained of invisible hands chocking him, and the feeling of being hit. She also claims that afterwords, there were red marks on his neck.7 David's condition caused him to start missing school, and David also gained 60 pounds over the next few months.8 He also began to growl, hiss, speak in strange voices, and suddenly recite passages from the Bible or from Paradise Lost. Each night, the family says that a family member would remain awake with David through sometime 30 minute long rapid spasms and convulsions.9 The Warrens claim that three &quot;lesser exorcisms&quot; took place, the first with four priests in attendance, and that when asked how many demons where inside him, David listed 43 names.10 She also claims David had marks all over his body, levitated, and demonstrated the supernatural ability of precognition relating to the murder Johnson would later commit.11
While staying with Debbie's family, Johnson supposedly taunted the demons said to be within David to possess his own body while participating in David's exorcisms.1213 As David's condition worsened, Debbie and Johnson moved out; Debbie was hired by Alan Bono, a new resident of the town, as a dog groomer at the Brookfield Pet Motel, and given an nearby apartment to stay at. It was then that Johnson's behavior supposedly began to change, and made Debbie fear that he had become possessed as well. According to Debbie, Johnson would go into a kind of trance, where he would growl, and say he saw a beast, but later have no memory of it.14
The attack
On February 16th, 1981, Johnson called in sick to his job at Wright Tree Service, claiming he had a sore throat.15 He joined his girlfriend Debbie at the animal clinic where she worked along with her sister and cousin. Alan Bono, the couples 40 year old landlord and Debbie's employer at the kennel, bought the whole group lunch at a local bar, with Bono, Johnson, and Debbie all drinking wine, Bono more than the rest of the group.16 After lunch, the group returned to the dog kennels, where Johnson fixed Bono's stereo, which blared noisily.17 Debbie then took the girls to get lunch, but insisted they return quickly, saying &quot;There's going to be trouble.&quot;18 When they returned, Bono invited everyone up to his apartment above the kennel, and when the television was turned on, it too was very loud, and Bono became agitated, punching his fist into his palm.19 Everyone left the room at Debbies urging, except Bono seized Debbie's nine year old cousin Mary and would not let go.20 Johnson, who had walked to the car, headed back to the apartment and told Bono to release Mary.21 Wanda Johnson, who recounted her story to the police, stated that &quot;it just broke&quot;.22 Mary ran for the car, an Debbie stood between the two men.23 Wanda, who was holding on to Johnson, remembers he was &quot;like stone&quot;, and couldn't be moved. Wanda heard Johnson growling like an animal, and a flash through the air, and stated that &quot;it just stopped&quot;.24 Johnson walked towards the woods, staring straight ahead, and Bono continued to punch his fist into his palm, before falling on his face.25 Bono had suffered &quot;four or five tremendous wounds&quot; according to Johnson's lawyer from Johnsons 5 inch pocket knife, mostly on his chest, and one that stretched from his stomach to the base of his heart.26 Bono died several hours later from his wounds.27 Johnson was discovered two miles from the site of the murder and was held at the Bridgeport Correctional Center on bail of 125,000 USD.28 It was the first murder in the history of Brookfield, Connecticut.29
Legal Proceedings
Johnson's lawyer traveled to England to meet with lawyers who had been involved in two similar cases, planned to fly in exorcism specialists from Europe, and threatened to supoena the priests involved if they would not cooperate.30
The trial took place in Danbury, Connecticut Superior Court beginning on October 28th, 1981.3132 Johnson's lawyer entered the unprecedented plea of not guilty by virtue of possession by the devil, but the presiding judge, Robert Callahan, rejected Johnson's lawyers attempt to show that Johnson was under the influence of a demon at the time of the murder. Callahan stated that there was no such defense, and it would be &quot;irrelative and unscientific&quot; to allow such testamony, forcing the defense attorney to argue instead that Johnson acted in self-defense.333435 The jury thus never heard the defense lawyers theory.36 The jury deliberated for 15 hours over three days before convicting Johnson.37 On November 24th, 1981, Johson was convicted of first-degree manslaughter, and was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison, of which he served 5.383940
Aftermath
After he served his sentence, Johnson went on to marry his fiancee.41 The alleged incident led to the creation of a made for TV movie called The Demon Murder Case on NBC and a major motion picture which has stalled due to internal conflicts.4243 In 1983, Gerald Brittle, with the assistance of Lorraine Warren, published a book about the incident entitled The Devil in Connecticut, which Lorraine Warren says the profits of which were shared with the family.4445 Two-thousand dollars was paid by the book publisher to the family.46 Upon the books republication in 2006 by iUniverse Inc., Carl Glatzel Jr. and David Glatzel sued the authors and book publishers for violating their right to privacy, libel, and &quot;intentional affliction of emotional distress&quot;; further, he claims the book alleges he committed criminal and abusive acts against his family and others.4748 Carl Glatzel Jr. has stated that the possession story was a hoax concocted by Ed and Lorraine Warren to exploit the family and his brothers mental illness, and that the book presents him as the villain because he disbelieved in the supernatural claims.49 He also asserts that the Warrens said that the story would make the family &quot;millionaires&quot;, and would help get Johnson out of jail.50 He is currently writing a book titled Alone Through The Valley about his version of the events surrounding his brother.51 Further, the publicity generated by the alleged incident forced Carl to drop out of school, and lost friends and business opportunities.52 Lorraine Warren defends her work with the family, claiming that the six priests who were involved in the incident agreed at the time that the boy was possessed.53 Gerald Brittle, the books author, says he wrote the book because &quot;the family wanted the story told&quot;, that he possesses video of over 100 hours of his interviews with the family, and that they signed off on the book as accurate before it went to print.54 Glatzel's father, Carl Glatzel Senior, denies telling the author that his son was possessed.55 Johnson and his wife Debbie believe the account of demonic possession to be true, and that Glatzel is suing to make money.56
