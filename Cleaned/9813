}} was a 9.0 MW megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on Friday 11 March 2011.12345 The epicenter was reported to be  off the east coast of the Oshika Peninsula, T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku, with the hypocenter at a depth of .67
The earthquake triggered tsunami warnings and evacuations along Japan's Pacific coast and in at least 20 countries, including the entire Pacific coast of North America and South America.8910 The earthquake created extremely destructive tsunami waves of up to  that struck Japan minutes after the quake, in some cases travelling up to  inland,11 with smaller waves after several hours in many other countries.12
The Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed  deaths,  injuries, and  people missing across 16 prefectures, but estimated numbers are far higher, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands dead or missing.13 The earthquake and tsunami caused extensive and severe damage in Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.4 million without water.14 Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors partially melted down,1516 which prompted evacuations of the affected areas,17 and a state of emergency was established. Three reactors believed to have partially melted down have experienced a chemical explosion extensively damaging their buildings, and the integrity of the inner core-containment vessel of one compromised and some dangerously radioactive release from the plant has occurred.181920 Residents within a  radius of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant and a  radius of the Fukushima II Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated. Early estimates from AIR Worldwide place insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion.21 Chief economist for Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, said in a note to clients that the estimated economic loss may be around $171&lt;U+2013&gt;183 billion22 just to the region which was hit by the quake and tsunami. The Bank of Japan offered &lt;U+00A5&gt;15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March 201123 to normalize market conditions.
The estimates of the Sendai earthquake's magnitude made it the strongest known earthquake to hit Japan, and one of the the five strongest earthquakes in the world overall since modern record-keeping began in 1900.24252627 Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said that &quot;in the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan.&quot;28 The earthquake moved Honshu  east and shifted the Earth on its axis by almost .29

Map of the Sendai earthquake and aftershocks
The main earthquake was preceded by a number of large foreshocks, beginning with a 7.2 MW event on 9 March approximately  from 11 March quake, and followed by another three on the same day in excess of 6 MW in magnitude.30 One minute prior to the effects of the earthquake being felt in Tokyo, the Earthquake Early Warning system connected to more than 1,000 seismometers in Japan sent out warnings on television of an impending earthquake to millions. This was possible because the damaging seismic S-waves, traveling at 4 kilometers per second, took about 90 seconds to travel the  to Tokyo. The early warning is believed by the Japan Meteorological Agency to have saved many lives.3132
The earthquake occurred at 14:46 local time in the western Pacific Ocean,  east of Sendai, Honshu, Japan. Its epicenter was  from Tokyo, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Multiple aftershocks were reported after the initial magnitude 9.0 quake. A magnitude 7.0 aftershock was reported at 15:06 local time, 7.4 at 15:15 local time and 7.2 at 15:26 local time.33 Over five hundred aftershocks of magnitude 4.5 or greater have occurred since the initial quake.34
Initially reported as 7.9 by the USGS, the magnitude was quickly upgraded to 8.8 and then to 8.9,35 and then again to 9.0.3637 This earthquake occurred where the Pacific Plate is subducting under the plate beneath northern Honshu; which plate this is is a matter of debate amongst scientists.3839 The Pacific plate, which moves at a rate of  a year, dips under Honshu's underlying plate releasing large amounts of energy. This motion pulls the upper plate down until it breaks. The break  off of the coast of Sendai was estimated to be several tens of kilometers long and only  deep, and caused the sea floor to spring up several meters, causing the earthquake.4041 A quake of this size usually has a rupture length of at least  and requires a long, relatively straight fault line. Because the plate boundary and subduction zone in this region is not very straight, it is unusual for the magnitude of an earthquake to exceed 8.5; the magnitude of this earthquake was a surprise to some seismologists.42 The hypocentral region of this earthquake extends from offshore Iwate to offshore Ibaraki Prefectures.43 The Japanese Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake may have ruptured the fault zone from Iwate to Ibaraki with a length of  and a width of .4445 Analysis showed that this earthquake consisted of a set of three events.46 The earthquake may have had a mechanism similar to that of another large earthquake in 869 with estimated magnitude Ms 8.6, which also created a large tsunami.47 Other major earthquakes with tsunamis struck the Sanriku Coast region in 1896 and 1933.
The quake registered the maximum of 7 on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale in Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture.48 Three other prefectures&lt;U+2014&gt;Fukushima, Ibaraki and Tochigi&lt;U+2014&gt;recorded an upper 6 on the JMA scale. Seismic stations in Iwate, Gunma, Saitama and Chiba Prefecture measured a lower 6, recording an upper 5 in Tokyo.
Energy
This earthquake released a surface energy (Me) of 1.9&lt;U+00B1&gt;0.5&lt;U+00D7&gt;1017 joules,49 dissipated as shaking and tsunamic energy, which is nearly double that of the 9.1-magnitude 2004 Sumatran earthquake that killed 230,000 people, and flung the 2,600 ton Apung 1 ship  inland. &quot;If we could only harness the [surface] energy from this earthquake, it would power [a] city the size of Los Angeles for an entire year,&quot; USGS director Marcia McNutt said in an interview.50 The total energy released (Mw) was more than 200,000 times the surface energy and was calculated by the USGS WPhase Moment Solution at 3.9&lt;U+00D7&gt;1022 joules,51 slightly less than the 2004 Sumatra quake. This is equivalent to 9.32 teratons of TNT (approximately 600 million times that of the Hiroshima bomb, or 186,400 times as powerful as man's largest-ever explosive device, Tsar Bomba).
Geophysical impact
 The quake moved portions of northeast Japan by as much as  closer to North America,52 making portions of Japan's landmass &quot;wider than before,&quot; according to geophysicist Ross Stein.53 Portions of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts.54 Stein also noted that a 400 km (250 mile) stretch of coastline dropped vertically by 0.6 meters (2 feet), allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land.55
According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake's enormous strength shifted the Earth's axis by . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth.56 The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass.57
Shinmoedake, a volcano in Kyushu, erupted two days after the earthquake. The volcano had erupted in January 2011; it is not known if the later eruption was linked to the earthquake.58
Tsunami
  The earthquake caused a massive tsunami which wrought massive destruction along the Pacific coastline of Japan's northern islands. The tsunami propagated across the Pacific, and warnings were issued and evacuations carried out in many countries with Pacific coasts, including the entire Pacific coast of North and South America from Alaska to Chile;596061 however, while the tsunami was felt in many of these places, it caused only relatively minor effects. Chile has the Pacific coast furthest from Japan (about 17,000 km away62&lt;U+2014&gt;the furthest possible distance on the earth is the semi-circumference, about 20,000 km63) but still was struck by tsunami waves up to 2 meters high.64
Japan
The tsunami warning issued by the Japan Meteorological Agency was the most serious on its warning scale; it rated as a &quot;Major tsunami&quot;, being at least  high.65 The actual height predicted varied, the greatest being for Miyagi at  high.66 The earthquake took place at 14:46 JST around  from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30 minutes to reach the areas first affected, and then areas further north and south based on the geography of the coastline.6768 Just over an hour after the earthquake, a tsunami was observed at 15:55 JST flooding Sendai Airport, which is located near the coast of Miyagi Prefecture,6970 with waves sweeping away cars and planes and flooding various buildings as they traveled inland.7172 The impact of the tsunami in and around Sendai Airport was filmed by an NHK News helicopter, showing a number of vehicles on local roads trying to escape the approaching wave and being engulfed by it.73 A -high tsunami hit Iwate Prefecture.74
Like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami and Cyclone Nargis, the damage by surging water, though much more localized, was far more deadly and destructive than the actual quake. There were reports of &quot;whole towns gone&quot; from tsunami-hit areas in Japan, including 9,500 missing in Minamisanriku;75 one thousand bodies had been recovered in the town by 14 March 2011.76
Kuji and Ofunato have been &quot;swept away ... leaving no trace that a town was there.&quot;77 Also destroyed was Rikuzentakata, where the tsunami was reportedly three stories high.787980 Other cities reportedly destroyed or heavily damaged by the tsunami include Miyako, &lt;U+014C&gt;tsuchi, and Yamada (all in Iwate Prefecture), Namie, S&lt;U+014D&gt;ma and Minamis&lt;U+014D&gt;ma (all in Fukushima Prefecture) and Onagawa, Natori, Ishinomaki, and Kesennuma (all in Miyagi Prefecture).81828384 The severest effects of the tsunami were felt along a -long stretch of coastline from Erimo in the north to Oarai in the south, with most of the destruction in that area occurring in the hour following the earthquake.85
On 13 March 2011, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) published details of tsunami observations recorded around the coastline of Japan following the earthquake. These observations included tsunami maximum readings of over  at the following locations and times on 11 March 2011, following the earthquake at 14:46 JST:86
15:12 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Iwate Kamaishi-oki &lt;U+2013&gt; 
15:15 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Ofunato &lt;U+2013&gt;  or more
15:20 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Ishinomaki-shi Ayukawa &lt;U+2013&gt;  or more
15:21 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Miyako &lt;U+2013&gt;  or more
15:21 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Kamaishi &lt;U+2013&gt;  or more
15:44 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Erimo-cho Shoya &lt;U+2013&gt; 
15:50 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Soma &lt;U+2013&gt; 
16:52 JST &lt;U+2013&gt; Oarai &lt;U+2013&gt; 
These readings were obtained from recording stations maintained by the JMA around the coastline of Japan. Many areas were also affected by tsunamis of  in height, and the JMA bulletin also included the caveat that &quot;At some parts of the coasts, tsunamis may be higher than those observed at the observation sites.&quot; The timing of the earliest recorded tsunami maximum readings ranged from 15:12 to 15:21, between 26 and 35 minutes after the earthquake had struck. The bulletin also included initial tsunami observation details, as well as more detailed maps for the coastlines affected by the tsunamis.8788
Elsewhere across the Pacific
 Shortly after the earthquake, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) issued tsunami watches and warnings for locations in the Pacific. At 07:30 UTC PTWC issued a widespread tsunami warning for the entire Pacific Ocean.8990 The United States West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning for the coastal areas of California and Oregon from Point Conception, California, to the Oregon-Washington border.91 In California and Oregon, up to  high tsunami surges hit some areas, damaging docks and harbors and causing over US$10 million of damage.9293 Hawaii estimated damage to public infrastructure alone at $3 million.94 A tsunami warning was also advised for the Canadian province of British Columbia, where the potentially affected areas included British Columbia's north coast and the outer west coast of Vancouver Island.95
Some South Pacific countries, including Tonga, American Samoa and New Zealand, experienced larger-than-normal waves, but did not report any major damage.96 Along the Pacific Coast of Mexico and South America, tsunami surges were reported, but in most places caused little or no damage.97 Peru reported a wave of  and over 300 homes damaged.98 The surge in Chile was large enough to cause some damage.
Russia evacuated 11,000 residents from coastal areas of the Kuril Islands.99 In the Philippines, waves up to  high hit the eastern seaboard of the country.
Casualties
 Both the earthquake and the resultant tsunami caused many casualties. Unlike other countries which had many hours' notice of a relatively small surge, a major tsunami struck Japan with only minutes' warning, leaving many people unable to escape.
The National Police Agency has officially confirmed  people dead,  injured, and  missing across sixteen prefectures.100 These numbers are expected to significantly increase,101 with casualties expected to reach tens of thousands.102
Prefectural officials and the Kyodo News Agency, quoting local officials, said that 9,500 people from Minamisanriku in Miyagi Prefecture&lt;U+2014&gt;about a half of the town's population&lt;U+2014&gt;were unaccounted for.103 NHK has reported that the death toll in Iwate Prefecture alone may reach 10,000.104
Officials in Wakabayashi-ku, Sendai, which was heavily damaged by tsunami waves, stated that they had found the bodies of 200&lt;U+2013&gt;300 victims.105
It was reported that four passenger trains containing an unknown number of passengers disappeared in a coastal area during the tsunami.106 One of the trains, on the Senseki Line, was found derailed in the morning; all passengers were rescued by a police helicopter.107 Der Spiegel later reported that five missing trains in Miyagi Prefecture had been found with all passengers safe, although this information could not be confirmed locally.108
By 9:30 UTC on March 11, Google Person Finder, which was previously used in the Haitian, Chilean, and Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes, was collecting information about survivors and their locations.109110 The Next of Kin Registry NOKR is assisting the Japanese government in locating next of kin for those missing or deceased.111
One man was killed in Papua, Indonesia after being swept out to sea.112 Near Crescent City, California, a 25-year-old man who is said to have been attempting to photograph the oncoming tsunami was swept out to sea and confirmed dead.113
Damage and effects
Debris washed out to sea
The degree of damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami combined, most due to the tsunami, is very great. Film of the worst affected towns show nothing more than piles of rubble, with almost no parts of any structures left standing.114 The extent of the damage was also massive. Estimates of the value of the damage range well into the tens of billions of US dollars; before-and-after satellite photographs of devastated regions show immense damage to many places.115116
Nuclear power plants
Fukushima I, Fukushima II, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and T&lt;U+014D&gt;kai nuclear power stations consisting of eleven reactors were automatically shut down following the earthquake.117 Higashid&lt;U+014D&gt;ri, also on the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection. Cooling is needed to remove decay heat for several days after a plant has been shut down. The cooling process is powered by emergency diesel generators, as in the case of Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant.118 At Fukushima I and II tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems including two large explosions at Fukushima I and leakage of radiation. Over 200,000 people have been evacuated.119
Seismic recordings at six assessed nuclear power plant facilities indicated the plants had been exposed to peak ground accelerations of 0.0285&lt;U+2013&gt;0.5324&lt;U+202F&gt;g and peak ground velocities of : 4.127&lt;U+2013&gt;67.3216 cm/sec.120
Europe's energy commissioner Guenther Oettinger, in remarks to the European Parliament on 15 March, called the nuclear disaster an &quot;apocalypse&quot;, saying that the word was particularly well chosen, and that Tokyo had almost lost control of events at the Fukushima power plant.121
Fukushima I and II Nuclear Power Plants
  Japan declared a state of emergency following the failure of the cooling system at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant,122 resulting in the evacuation of nearby residents.123124 Officials from the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency have reported that radiation levels inside the plant are up to 1,000 times normal levels,125 and that radiation levels outside the plant are up to 8 times normal levels.126 Later, a state of emergency was also declared at the Fukushima II nuclear power plant about 11 km (7 mi) south.127 This brings the total number of problematic reactors to six,128 two of which (unit 1 and 3 at Fukushima I) experienced a partial meltdown.129130131
On March 12, a large explosion, thought to be caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas, blew away the roof and outer walls of the Reactor 1 building, releasing a large cloud of dust and vapor, but the reactor itself was not damaged in the explosion.132133134 A BBC journalist reported being stopped 60 km from the blast site by police.135
At 01:17 JST on Sunday 13 March (12 March 16:17 GMT), the Japan Atomic Energy Agency announced that it was rating the Fukushima accident at 4 (accident with local consequences) on the 0&lt;U+2013&gt;7 International Nuclear Event Scale (INES),136 below the Three Mile Island accident in seriousness.137 This has been questioned by the French ASN nuclear safety authority. They say the accident can be classed as a 5 or 6, which would be comparable to or worse than the Three Mile Island accident.138
Another explosion occurred at Reactor 3 of the Fukushima I plant just after 11:00 am local time on March 14.139 An exterior wall of the building collapsed, but the reactor vessel was not damaged according to a government spokesperson.140 At 16:29 UTC on Monday 14 March (14 March 01:29 UTC), the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency announced that the explosion had occurred. The local population was advised by the authorities to stay home until the radioactive situation of the environment is totally clarified.141 Unlike the other five reactor units, reactor 3 runs on mixed uranium and plutonium oxide, or MOX fuel, making it potentially more dangerous in an incident due to the neutronic effects of plutonium on the reactor and the carcinogenic effects in the event of release to the environment.142143144 Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) is trying to reduce the pressure within the plants by venting contaminated steam from the reactor vessels into the atmosphere. According to Tomoko Murakami, of the nuclear energy group at Japan's Institute of Energy Economics, this would not result in the release of significant radiation.145 Residents living within a  radius of the Fukushima I plant were evacuated, as well as residents within  of the Fukushima II plant.146147148149
Additionally, it was reported on 14 Mar at 07:00 EDT that the fuel rods of Reactor 2 at the Fukushima I plant were now fully exposed, and a meltdown of the fuel rods, with the risk of damage to the reactor vessel and a possible radioactive leak, could not be ruled out.150 As of 14 March, about 160 people have been exposed to dangerous radiation levels near the power stations. One plant employee was killed while operating a crane, eight others have been injured.151 An additional eleven employees were injured when the Reactor 3 building exploded.152 Several people received some radiation doses.153
On Tuesday, March 15, at 6:10 a.m. local time an explosion occurred at Reactor 2 of the Fukushima I plant.154 Radiation &quot;exceeding the legal limit&quot; was detected outside the plant. The government admitted it was &quot;very probable&quot; that the cores of Reactors 1, 2 and 3 had experienced meltdowns due to high temperatures.155 According to TEPCO, the plant's operator, the radiation level at 8:31 a.m. local time had risen to 8.217 millisieverts (mSv) per hour, more than eight times the exposure permitted by law per year.156 Later the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announced that according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, the hourly radiation at the nuclear plant site reached 400 mSv.157158 A fourth Fukushima I reactor, Reactor 4, was also rocked by an explosion on March 15.159
A US Navy relief group moved from the immediate area after its helicopters detected low-level radiation while returning to their aircraft carrier from a SAR mission, 160 km (100 miles) offshore. The flight absorbed the equivalent amount of earthbound background radiation for a month, in the span of about an hour.160161
Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant
A map showing epicenter of earthquake and position of nuclear power plants
A fire from the turbine section of the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant following the earthquake was reported by Kyodo News.162163 The blaze was in a building housing the turbine, which is sited separately from the plant's reactor,164 and was soon extinguished.165
On 13 March the lowest-level state of emergency was declared regarding the Onagawa plant by TEPCO, as radioactivity readings temporarily166 exceeded allowed levels in the area of the plant.167168 TEPCO stated this was due to radiation from the Fukushima I nuclear accidents and not from the Onagawa plant itself.169
T&lt;U+014D&gt;kai Nuclear Power Plant
The number 2 reactor at T&lt;U+014D&gt;kai Nuclear Power Plant was shut down automatically.170 On 14 March it was reported that a cooling system pump for this reactor had stopped working,171 but the Japan Atomic Power Company stated that there was a second operational pump and cooling was working, but that two of three diesel generators used to power the cooling system were out of order.172
Port
The effects of the quake included visible smoke rising from a building in the Port of Tokyo with parts of the port areas being flooded, including soil liquefaction in Tokyo Disneyland's carpark.173174
Dam failure
The Fujinuma irrigation dam in Sukagawa ruptured,175 causing flooding and washing away homes.176 No casualties have been counted,177 but people are missing178
Water
At least 1.5 million households were reported to have lost access to water supplies.179
Electricity
According to Tohoku Electric, around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity.180 Several nuclear and conventional power plants went offline after the earthquake. Rolling blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages caused by the earthquake.181 The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which normally provides approximately 40 GW of electricity, announced that it can currently provide only about 30 GW. This is because 40 percent of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area is now supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures.182 Two of those reactors, the Fukushima Dai-ichi and Fukushima Dai-ni, were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and have sustained major damage related to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Rolling blackouts of three hours are expected to last until the end of April and will affect the Tokyo, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures.183
Oil
 A 220,000-barrel-per-day184 oil refinery of Cosmo Oil Company was set on fire by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba Prefecture, to the east of Tokyo.185 Major fires broke out elsewhere, such as in the city of Kesennuma.186187
In Sendai, a 145,000-barrel-per-day refinery owned by the largest refiner in Japan, JX Nippon Oil &amp; Energy, was also set ablaze by the quake.188 Workers were evacuated,189 but tsunami warnings hindered efforts to extinguish the fire until 14 March, when officials planned to do so.190
Transport
Japan's transport network suffered severe disruption. Many sections of Tohoku expressway serving northern Japan were damaged.191 All railway services were suspended in Tokyo, with an estimated 20,000 people stranded at major stations across the city.192 In the hours after the earthquake, some train services were resumed.193 Most Tokyo area train lines resumed full service by the next day-12 March.194 Twenty thousand stranded visitors spent the night of 11&lt;U+2013&gt;12 March inside Tokyo Disneyland.195
A tsunami wave was seen flooding Sendai Airport at 15:55 JST,196 about 1 hour after the initial quake. Narita and Haneda Airport both suspended operations after the quake, with most flights diverted to other airports for about 24 hours.197 Ten airliners bound for Narita were diverted to nearby Yokota Air Base.198
Stranded passengers on a Tokyo train. Major disruptions to train travel, as well as car and airplane travel, have occurred in places such as Tokyo and northeastern Japan.
Various train services around Japan were also canceled, with JR East suspending all services for the rest of the day.199 Four trains on coastal lines were reported as being out of contact with operators; one, a four-car train on the Senseki Line, was found to have derailed, and its occupants were rescued shortly after 8 am the next morning.200 There had been no derailments of Shinkansen bullet train services in and out of Tokyo, but their services were also suspended.201 The T&lt;U+014D&gt;kaid&lt;U+014D&gt; Shinkansen resumed limited service late in the day and was back to its normal schedule by the next day, while the J&lt;U+014D&gt;etsu and Nagano Shinkansen resumed services late on 12 March; however, the T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku Shinkansen remained suspended, with visible damage to electrical poles and elevated spans, and the state of the line in harder-hit areas still difficult to ascertain.202 Services on the T&lt;U+014D&gt;hoku Shinkansen partially resumed on 15 March, with one round-trip service per hour between Tokyo and Nasu-Shiobara.203
The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima later had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10&lt;U+2013&gt;20 minute intervals (normally 3&lt;U+2013&gt;5 minutes), operating some lines only at rush hour, and completely shutting down others (notably, the Tokaido Main Line, Yokosuka Line, Sobu Main Line and Chuo-Sobu Line were all stopped for the day).204 This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home.
Telecommunications
Cellular and landline phone service suffered major disruptions in the affected area.205 Internet services, however, were to a large extent able to reroute around the damage;206 only a few websites were initially unreachable.207 Several Wi-Fi hotspot providers have reacted to the quake by providing free access to their networks.208
Sports
The 2011 World Figure Skating Championships were scheduled to take place from 21&lt;U+2013&gt;27 March at the Yoyogi National Gymnasium in Tokyo but the International Skating Union decided on 14 March to postpone the event, after the German team announced that it would follow recommendations not to travel to Japan.209 International Skating Union President Ottavio Cinquanta published a statement on the federation website on March 15, confirming the cancellation of the event. However, the possibility of re-scheduling remains, said the ISU chief. &quot;The postponement of the event or alternatively the final cancellation is under evaluation.&quot;210
Also on hold is the ISU Figure Skating World Team Trophy, scheduled for Yokohama on April 14&lt;U+2013&gt;17. The ISU is waiting for guidance from Japanese authorities on whether the skating championships can be held. &quot;It is understood that a postponement of the above-mentioned World Championships as well as the holding of the ISU World Team Trophy is subject to the confirmation by the competent Japanese authorities that the situation is back to normal conditions allowing the safe conduct of major ISU sports Events in the Tokyo area,&quot; says the ISU.211
Economic impact
 The northern Tohoku region, which was most affected, accounts for about 8 percent of the country's gross domestic product as it has factories that make products such as cars and beer as well as energy infrastructure.212 The region has been experiencing a brain drain and economic drainage as young people leave the area.213 It includes the northern Miyagi prefecture, where Sendai is located, about 300 km (180 miles) northeast of Tokyo. The Miyagi area includes manufacturing and industrial zones with chemical and electronics plants. It is estimated that Miyagi accounts for 1.7% of Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s gross domestic product.214
The earthquake and tsunami have had significant immediate impacts on businesses such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda, who completely suspended auto production until 14 March. Nippon Steel Corporation also suspended production, Toyo Tire &amp; Rubber Company and Sumitomo Rubber Industries shuttered their tire and rubber production lines, while GS Yuasa closed its automotive battery production. This was expected to hinder supply availability for automakers.215 Tokyo Electric Power Company, Toshiba, East Japan Railway Company and Shin-Etsu Chemical Company were suggested as the most vulnerable companies as a result of the earthquake.216 Sony also suspended production at all its six plants in the area, while Fuji Heavy Industries discontinued production at most of its factories in the Gunma and the Tochigi Prefectures.217 Other factories suspending operations include Kirin Holdings, GlaxoSmithKline, Nestl&lt;U+00E9&gt;218 and Toyota amid power cuts.219 The factory shutdowns, power cuts and the consequent presumed impact on consumer confidence could hurt the national GDP for several months, although economist Michael Boskin predicts &quot;only minimal impact on the Japanese economy overall.&quot;220221
On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, in an attempt to maintain market stability,222 injected 15 trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a plunge in stocks and surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity in the aftermath of the disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to exchange-traded funds to the tune of 10 trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections will continue as needed.223 However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient224 despite 8 trillion yen being pumped into the market.225 On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's default risk surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower.226 Residents of Tokyo were also reported to have gone on a panic shopping spree as daily necessities were sought after and gasoline was stocked up with the increasing risk of nuclear radiation leaks.227
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano has said that Japan's government will convene on 13 March to gauge the economic effects of the catastrophe.228 He also told NHK Television that about 200 billion yen that was remaining from the budget for the concurrent fiscal year that would end on 31 March would be used to fund the immediate recovery efforts. Additional measures could also hurt Japan's public debt (which is already the highest in the world). This additional spending could hurt demand for government bonds.229
Some economic analysts consider that, ultimately, the catastrophe will improve Japan's economy, with increased job availability during restoration efforts. An analyst at JPMorgan Chase, citing the 1989 San Francisco earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake, noted that natural disasters &quot;do eventually boost output.&quot; An analyst at Soci&lt;U+00E9&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; G&lt;U+00E9&gt;n&lt;U+00E9&gt;rale anticipated that Japan's economy will decline in March but will revive powerfully in subsequent months. After the Kobe earthquake, industrial output dropped 2.6%, but increased by 2.2% the next month, and 1% the following month. Japan's economy then accelerated substantially through the next two years, at more than its former rate.230 Others are of the opinion that the catastrophe will harm the economy.231 Some have argued that those who predict that the reconstruction effort could help Japan's economy fall into the broken window fallacy.232
Global financial impact
In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s Nikkei stock market index saw its futures slide 5% in after-market trading.233 The Bank of Japan said that they would do their utmost to ensure financial market stability.234 On Tuesday, March 15, news of rising radiation levels caused the Nikkei to drop over 1,000 points or 10.6% (16% for the week).235
Other stock markets around the world were also affected; the German DAX lost 1.2% and fell to 6,978 points within minutes.236 Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell by 1.8%, while South Korea's Kospi index slumped by 1.3%.237 By the end of trading on Friday, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index had dropped by 1.8%.238 Major U.S. stock market indexes rose between 0.5% and 0.7%.239 Oil prices also dropped as a result of the closure of Japanese refineries, despite the ongoing violence in Libya and expected demonstrations in Saudi Arabia. US crude dropped as low as $99.01 from $100.08 by lunchtime, with Brent Crude falling $2.62 to $112.81.240 In Hong Kong, Financial Secretary John Tsang warned investors to &quot;take extra care&quot; as the earthquake may have a short term impact on each local stock market.241
The share prices of the biggest reinsurance companies Munich Re and Swiss Reinsurance Company fell following the earthquake on speculation that they may face losses &quot;somewhere in the $10 billion range&quot; even after certain costs were absorbed by Japan&lt;U+2019&gt;s primary insurers and the government.242
Peter Bradford, a former member of the United States' Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that the impact on the nuclear power plant was &quot;obviously a significant setback for the so-called nuclear renaissance. The image of a nuclear power plant blowing up before your eyes on a television screen is a first.&quot;243
Response
Government response
Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced the government has mobilized the Japanese Self-Defense Forces in various earthquake disaster zones.244 He asked the Japanese public to act calmly and tune into various media for updated information.245246 He also reported numerous nuclear power plants have automatically shut down to prevent damage and radiation leaks.247 He also set up emergency headquarters in his office to coordinate the government's response.248
Kan promised his 100% cooperation in alleviating the situation. He declared that &quot;the safety of Japan's citizens is the priority, and to save every possible life is his current mission.&quot; He added that the defense force, police, rescue crew and individuals are currently working at full potential to mediate the situation, and called for more help from all over Japan. Evacuation shelters currently are facing a shortage of potable water, food, blankets and bathroom facilities, as the government arranges these necessities to be delivered to where they are needed as soon as possible, from various areas of Japan and abroad. Dropping temperatures due to the disruption in electrical and gas lines caused further problems at shelters.249
A Japanese urban search and rescue team in New Zealand following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake was recalled.250
Request for international assistance
Japan specifically requested teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States;251252 it also requested, via its space agency JAXA, the activation of the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, allowing diverse satellite imagery of affected regions to be readily shared with rescue and aid organizations.253
International response
Japan received messages of condolence and offers of assistance from a range of international leaders. According to the United Nations, search and rescue teams from 45 countries had been offered to Japan.
The Fukushima incident brought the issue of nuclear power to the fore internationally, causing an anti-nuclear demonstration of 50,000 people in Stuttgart and the cancellation of a pro-nuclear press conference in the United Kingdom.254
Information and support
Among several resources offered to help find earthquake survivors and obtain information about people in Japan are: Disaster Message Board Web171 operated by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,255256 the International Committee of the Red Cross,257 American Red Cross,258 Google Person Finder,259 websites of the Australian Embassy,260 US Department of State,261 UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office,262 and the Honshu Quake wiki operated by the CrisisCommons volunteer community.263
Media coverage
Japan's national public broadcaster, NHK, and Japan Satellite Television suspended their usual programming to provide ongoing coverage of the situation.264 Various other nationwide Japanese TV networks also broadcast uninterrupted coverage of the disaster. Ustream Asia broadcast live feeds of NHK, Tokyo Broadcasting System, Fuji TV, TV Asahi, TV Kanagawa, and CNN on the Internet starting on 12 March 2011.265
On 14 March, NHK News reported a Japan Meteorological Agency warning that there was a 70% probability of a new earthquake exceeding magnitude 7.0 occurring within or near the same hypocentral region in the following three days.266
Scientific and research response
According to the chief scientist for the Multi-Hazards project at the U.S. Geological Survey, the fact that the Sendai earthquake took place in Japan &lt;U+2013&gt; a country with &quot;the best seismic information in the world&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; meant that for the first time it was hoped that data had been collected that would allow modeling of an earthquake of this type and severity in great detail. Andreas Reitbrock, a professor of seismology at the University of Liverpool, agreed, stating that &quot;It gives us, for the first time, the possibility to model in great detail what happened during the rupture of an earthquake.&quot; 267
The effect of this data is expected to be felt across other disciplines as well. Tom Heaton, a seismological engineer, commented that &quot;the tragedy would provide unprecedented information about how buildings hold up under long periods of shaking &lt;U+2014&gt; and thus how to build them better. We had very little information about that before now&quot;. 268
