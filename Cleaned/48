The Herb Garden, in the United States National Arboretum, showcases some 25 varieties of basil every year. The Herb Garden was a gift to the United States from the Herb Society of America. most, but not all culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum - sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It is particularly challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species is particularly difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.cite conference

Basil cultivars vary in several ways. Visually, the size of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the fragrance of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol estragole, eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.
