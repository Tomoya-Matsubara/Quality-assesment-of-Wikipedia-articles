The 2012 Michoac&lt;U+00E1&gt;n murder of photographers concerns two Mexican freelance photographers, Arturo Barajas L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez (1966? - 19 August 2012) and Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Antonio Aguilar Mota (1986? - 19 August 2012), who were kidnapped on 16 August 2012 and found murdered in Ecuandureo, Michoac&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, Mexico. The two photojournalists worked in an area that is known for narcotics trafficking and could have been targeted because of their employment as freelance journalists who sometimes photographed accident scenes for the local newspaper. 1
Career
Barajas, 46, and Lopez, 26, were both freelance photographers who were often seen offering their services in the plaza in the town of Zamora and also to the Zamora Valley Press Association. Barajas had also photographed accident scenes and drug-related crimes for the Diaro de Zamora newspaper. They were not, however, members of the press organization.23
Deaths
The two photographers were last seen on 16 August 2012 while on their way to photograph a social event. Their families said they had left home around 9 p.m. to work. Their bodies were found in the trunk of an abandoned car on Sunday, 19 August 2012 in the rural area of Tinaja de Vargas, outside the city of Ecuandureo. This city is about 90 miles from the town of Morelia, the capital of Michoac&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. Their bodies showed signs of torture and they were killed by gunshot wounds around the head.45
Related crimes
The murders are believed to have been carried out by members of Knights Templar Cartel (Los Caballeros Templarios Cartel), which since 2011 has controlled drug trafficking in the state of Michoac&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. Fifteen other people died in drug-related violence during the same weekend in Michoac&lt;U+00E1&gt;n. No progress has been made in the investigation.6
Impact
According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, there have been 27,199 homicides recorded in Mexico during 2011, making it the deadliest year since President Felipe Calderon was elected in 2006. During Calderon's presidency, Article 19 said there have been 72 journalists murdered, 13 journalists reported missing, and 40 assaults on journalists.7
Reactions
The Mexican federal government sent 1,000 additional troops to Michoac&lt;U+00E1&gt;n to give extra support to local police forces in their fight against the drug cartels operating in that area.8
