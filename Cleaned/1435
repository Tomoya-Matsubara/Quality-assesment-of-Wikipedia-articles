In 2006 Mishkin co-authored a report called Financial Stability in Iceland.5 The report maintained that Iceland's economic fundamentals were strong. The report was commissioned by the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce in response to critical coverage of the Icelandic economy and certain Icelandic companies in the international business media.6 Mishkin was paid $124,000 to co-author the report.7 Two and a half years later, Iceland experienced a spectacular financial collapse. According to the documentary film Inside Job, the title of the report was changed to Financial Instability in Iceland on Mishkin's curriculum vitae (CV). Mishkin's CV was later corrected to list the report with its original title.8 Mishkin wrote a note published on October 6, 2010 at the Financial Times' blog 9 explaining his participation in the documentary Inside Job. The director of Inside Job, Charles Ferguson, responded to Mishkin's note at the same blog.10
