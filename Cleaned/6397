Acetylferrocene is an organometallic compound based on ferrocene with one acetyl group added to one of the cyclopentadienyl rings. It is mainly used in military or space field as an additive in rocket propellant, to promote the burning rate.1 It is synthesized out of ferrocene by adding acetic acid anhydride, typically in the presence of phosphoric acid (to promote the Friedel-Crafts acylation).
