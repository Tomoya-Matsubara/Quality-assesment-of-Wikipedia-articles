The Hitachi Magic Wand (also known as the Original Magic Wand) is an electrical, mains-powered vibrating massager, manufactured by the Japanese company Hitachi for relieving tension and relaxing sore muscles. The device is well known for its use as a vibrator, a masturbation aid for women. The wand is  long and weighs . Stimulation is provided by its rubberised  head. Without attachments, the device functions effectively as a clitoral vibrator and is able to bring women to clitoral orgasm. Because of its popularity as a sex toy, aftermarket attachments designed to excite the clitoris, allow women to feel vibrations deeper into the vagina, and focus vibrations on the G-spot have been produced.
Hitachi listed the device for business in the United States in 1968. Its use as a vibrator was popularized by sex educator Betty Dodson in masturbation courses for women. In 2000, Hitachi had a conflict with its U.S. distributor and briefly stopped selling the device until it reached a new deal with distributor Vibratex. The Magic Wand briefly sold out after featuring in a 2002 episode of Sex and the City. Hitachi decided to cease production of the device in 2013 because of concerns about having its name attached to a sex toy. Vibratex persuaded the company to continue manufacturing it under the name &quot;Original Magic Wand&quot;, omitting the name Hitachi.
Academics researched use of the Magic Wand for treatment of chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems, including female sexual arousal disorder. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Hitachi HV 250 massager to be the most efficient option to address problems achieving orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research that found over 93% of a group of 465 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in multiple applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal &amp; Neonatal Nursing.
Sex shop Good Vibrations called the Magic Wand &quot;the Cadillac of vibrators&quot;. Counselors Ruth Westheimer and Laura Berman recommended the device to women, and Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Hitachi Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists. Mobile Magazine announced in its July 2005 issue that readers had voted the Hitachi Magic Wand &quot;the No. 1 greatest gadget of all time&quot;. In 2006, Melinda Gallagher and Emily Kramer, the founders of women's entertainment company CAKE, awarded the device the Best Vibrator Award in their book A Piece of Cake. Tanya Wexler's film Hysteria featured the device while showing the evolution of the vibrator. Women's Health recommended the device in its 2014 primer on sex toys. Engadget called the Magic Wand &quot;the most recognizable sex toy on Earth&quot;.1
Design and features
The device is  long and it weighs .23 Muscle and nerve stimulation is provided by the device's rubberised,  head, which is attached to the main body of the massager via a flexible neck.45 A  cord is attached to the device to provide power from mains electricity.6 The massager provides two vibration rates5,000 and 6,000 rpm, which are equivalent to 83 Hz and 100 Hzthat are controlled by a switch on its body:789 Because the device was not originally designed as a vibrator, it exhibits some deficiencies when used for this purpose.10 Apart from its size, bulk, and its reliance on a mains power supply that limits its portability, it is not waterproof or water-resistant, and it overheats when used for more than 25 minutes.11 It does not work well in electrical outlets outside the U.S.1213
Because of the Magic Wand's popularity, various aftermarket attachments with differences in colour, pattern of studs, and material, became available to purchase.1415 Such attachments have been produced by multiple different companies without ties to Hitachi.16 Without attachments, the device functions effectively as a clitoral vibrator, able to bring women to clitoral orgasm.17 Add-ons that are fitted over the top of the device and are used to excite the clitoris are available.18 An attachment called the &quot;Wonder Wand&quot; allows women to feel vibrations deep into the vagina.1920 According to an article in the Dermatology Online Journal, &quot;The Wonder Wand&lt;U+2122&gt; attachment is made of a smooth blue plastic that is easily cleaned after use&quot;.21 Attachments made of silicone designed to aid with penetrative sensations or to modify texture of the device are available.22 An add-on called the &quot;G-Spotter&quot; fits over the device in the same fashion and turns the device into a G-spot vibrator.2324 The &quot;Gee-Whiz&quot; is a similar type of attachment used to stimulate the G-spot.25 &quot;Liberator Axis&quot; is a booster pillow that stabilizes the Hitachi Magic Wand so the user does not have to hold it with her hands during use.2627 Attachments have been sold by Betty Dodson on her website, which provides pictorial instructions on their use with the Hitachi Magic Wand.2829 An attachment made by an unaffiliated company provides a cap that fits over the top of the device so it can function as a male masturbation sleeve.30
History
Debut as massager
On 25 April 1968, the Hitachi Magic Wand was listed for business use with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.3132 Kabushiki Kaisha Hitachi Seisakusho has registered the trademark to the Hitachi Magic Wand.33 It became available to the mass market in the U.S. during the 1970s and was advertised as a device to aid with massage techniques.3435 It is effective at relieving pain associated with back aches,36 and is registered with the Food and Drug Administration as a physical medicine device under the classification therapeutic electric massager.37 The stated use of the Magic Wand is the soothing and relaxing of sore muscles and nerves, relieving tension, and rehabilitation after sports injuries.3839
Women's masturbation education
The Magic Wand has found great commercial success as a vibrator, a masturbation aid for women.4041 Its popularity for this purpose is associated with the American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to teach women about masturbation.4243 Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method.44 In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation.45 In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Hitachi Magic Wand.46 In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs.47 Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said, &quot;She told me to get a Hitachi Magic Wand, but to be careful of its power, both physical and psychological, as it's an addictive agent right behind heroin. My only previous vibrator experience was a pink plastic thing that held two D-cell batteries and the Hitachi was a whole 'nother world.&quot;48
 The Hitachi Magic Wand has been a bestseller at the sex shop Good Vibrations since it opened in 1977.49 The device became an enduring bestseller in adult sex toy shops in the United States.50 It has become known colloquially among women as &quot;Big Buzzy&quot;.5152 During the 1980s, the device was advertised in the back pages of Mother Jones magazine.53 It became popular with women and was featured on the cover of the book Good Vibrations: The New Complete Guide to Vibrators (1976) by Joani Blank.5455 The Magic Wand features on the covers of the 1989 and 1998 editions of the book.5657 Good Vibes Gazette surveyed sex toy store customers in 1995 and asked them to rank their opinions of sex toys. The Hitachi Magic Wand was identified as &quot;most exceptional&quot;.58 In 1997, the Magic Wand was the most popular holiday gift item sold at the Good Vibrations store in Berkeley, California.59 According to Out magazine, the Magic Wand was the best-selling sex toy of 1998.60
Vibratex distribution
In 2000, the Hitachi company had a conflict with Appliance Corporation of America, the American distributor of its products including the Hitachi Magic Wand.61 The device ceased being sold briefly in the United States.62 In June 2000, Hitachi reached a deal with the sex toy distributor company Vibratex located in California to sell the device in the U.S.63 Vibratex has continued to sell the device in the U.S. through 2014.6465 Urologist and specialist in sexual dysfunction Jed Kaminetsky told The New York Observer in 2000, &quot;The thing is legendary. I tell women who are having problems with orgasms to masturbate. The vibrator is a very effective way to masturbate, and the Hitachi Magic Wand, if not the best, is one of the best vibrators out there.&quot;66
The concept of using a neck massager for other than its stated purpose was popularized in 2002 in the fifth-season episode of the television series Sex and the City, &quot;Critical Condition&quot;.6768 The character Samantha Jones goes to Sharper Image to buy a vibrator, but the staff at the store tell her it is a neck massager.6970 Shortly after being featured on Sex and the City, the Hitachi Magic Wand sold out of stores.71 Journalist Naomi Wolf wrote in The Sunday Times that while researching for an article on the female-oriented sex toys catalogue Good Vibrations, she was informed that the Hitachi Magic Wand had sold out from their stock because of its appearance on Sex and the City.72 According to The Times, the Hitachi Magic Wand was relatively new to the market in the United Kingdom, where it became available in 2004.73 Faye Flam writing for Knight Ridder Newspapers reported in 2006 that the Hitachi Magic Wand was exempt from anti-vibrator laws in Alabama, Georgia, and Texas because it did not appear to be a phallic object.74
The closing credits of director Tanya Wexler's 2011 film Hysteria featured the Hitachi Magic Wand in a montage showing the evolution of the vibrator.7576 In August 2012, American filmmaker Clayton Cubitt used the Hitachi Magic Wand in a video-art exhibit titled Hysterical Literature.777879 The film project featured women sitting on a chair reading from a piece of literature while being stimulated by the Hitachi Magic Wand.80 Each video ends with the woman's orgasm.81 Writing for The McClatchy Company, Chuck Shepherd called it &quot;Great Art!&quot;.8283
Rebranding
Because of its concerns about having its name attached to a popular sex toy, Hitachi decided to cease production of the Magic Wand in 2013.84 Vibratex director of operations Eddie Romero told Engadget that Hitachi is a &quot;very traditional&quot; company and was uncomfortable being associated with the best-selling masturbation aid.85 Vibratex persuaded Hitachi to continue manufacturing the device, to rename it the &quot;Original Magic Wand&quot;, to use lighter, more durable materials, and to omit any reference to Hitachi.86 The newly named device returned to the market in June 2013, with improved engineering and modified graphic design on its accompanying box.87 Hitachi does not market the device for sexual purposes.88 Betty Dodson told Engadget; &quot;Evidently, Mr. Hitachi Sr. didn't like the idea that his massage machine was giving millions of women orgasms ... It remains my favorite vibrator to this day&quot;.89
On 5 May 2014, the device was featured in a comedy segment of the television program Louie on FX.9091 In 2014, 250,000 Magic Wands were sold in the U.S. by Vibratex.92
Academic research
Sexual dysfunction treatment
Multiple academics have discussed use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to treat chronic anorgasmiaa type of sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasmand other sexual problems including female sexual arousal disorder.93949596
A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques in a sample of individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Hitachi HV 250 massager to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Hitachi Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.97
In 2008 The Scientific World Journal published research in which women with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. Authors Pia Struck and S&lt;U+00F8&gt;ren Ventegodt chose the Hitachi Magic Wand because of the size of the device's head. In their paper, they said this effectively created a vibrating sensation in the area of the subject's clitoris and vulva without creating superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 465 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Hitachi Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. Struck and Ventegodt said their course of treatment, which included a holistic body of options including use of the Hitachi Magic Wand, was logical, harmless, and effective.98
Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Hitachi Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations. Marcus found there were six distinct patterns in her subjects' experiences after education with the device; some experienced significant changes in their manner of orgasm, others felt frightened of introducing an object outside of their own bodies into their routine of pleasure, over reliance, modifications to perceptions surrounding sex, and emotional changes in their lovers. She said medical professionals intending to suggest use of a vibrator to their female patients for conditions including female sexual arousal disorder and anorgasmia should discuss the impact this could have after use.99
In a 2011 paper for the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell discussed changes in perceptions of sexual well-being in society. They said there has been a dearth of research on sex toys and their impact on sexual well-being. They discussed the Hitachi Magic Wand within the context of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose.100
The Hitachi Magic Wand has been used in studies in non-sexual applications.101102
Sex for the disabled
In their 2009 work Pleasure Able: Sexual Device Manual for Persons with Disabilities, authors Kate Naphtali and Edith MacHattie of the Disabilities Health Research Network under the supervision of doctors Andrei Krassioukov and Stacy L Elliott recommended use of the Hitachi Magic Wand in sexual activity for disabled persons. The authors said the person holding the device would need to be capable of maintaining an active wide grasp throughout the process. They wrote that the Hitachi Magic Wand was helpful for disabled people with either limited strength in their upper extremities or limited use of their hands. They also said it was &quot;ideal for people with limited extension in their arms&quot;.103
Dermatology
In a 2004 article published in Dermatology Online Journal, authors Kevin C Smith, Stephen L Comite, Suprina Balasubramanian, Alan Carver and Judy F Liu reported on use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to help alleviate pain before cosmetic and dermatologic techniques performed by clinicians. The authors described use of the device to decrease discomfort before procedures including supplementing anesthesia with the injection of triamcinolone acetonide into the proximal nail fold for psoriasis, decreasing discomfort during a Restylane injection of the nasolabial fold, making an Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) facial treatment easier by reducing pain during the procedure, and throughout axillary hyperhidrosis treatment with botulinum toxin. They recommended use of the device with the &quot;Wonder Wand&quot; attachment to provide vibration to a decreased surface area on the patient. The authors said, &quot;Although the use of vibration anesthesia generally does not eliminate pain completely, it can serve to make the injection or procedure much more tolerable&quot;.104
Kevin C Smith and Francisco Perez-Atamoros further elaborated on use of the Hitachi Magic Wand in Chapter 7 &quot;Other Dermatologic Uses of Botulinum Toxin&quot; of the 2006 book Botulinum Toxin in Clinical Dermatology, edited by Anthony V. Benedetto. They again emphasized the beneficial uses of the Magic Wand with the &quot;Wonder Wand&quot; attachment and showed how its vibrations can reduce pain if given just before an injection of Restylane within  from the injection site.105
Neonatology
Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu examined use of vibration delivery to infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 article for the Journal of Perinatal &amp; Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Hitachi Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting and placed it on the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that, &quot;Mechanical vibration produced an analgesic effect for infants who had previously experienced painful heel sticks that approached statistical significance&quot;.106 They concluded that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.107
Otolaryngology
In a 2011 article for the International Journal of Otolaryngology, Jeremy Hornibrook discussed the inner ear disorder Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo, a problem attributed to a detached otoconia in one of the semicircular canals.108 Hornibrook gave background on the disorder and its pathology. The author recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote, &quot;The most common repositioning treatment is Epley's CRP as modified by Parnes with one-minute pauses between head positions ... Following the CRP a repeat Dix Hallpike test is done&quot;.109 If such a test is positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Hitachi Magic Wand 250 Hz massager to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.110
Proprioception
Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon reported in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on their use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. They created vibrations in the biceps muscles of their subjects while asking them to determine the position of their fingertips through spatial awareness of the human body with respect to its location. Rabin and Gordon said, &quot;As expected, without tactile cues, biceps vibration caused illusory elbow extension&quot;.111
Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. Their research concluded, &quot;muscle stretch and tactile cues are integrated to locate the arm within a highly specific context associated with tactile and proprioceptive feedback from prior experience and current movement goals&quot;.112
Rabin and Gordon co-wrote a paper with Lisa Muratorib and Konstantina Svokosa, published in 2010 in Neuroscience Letters, expanding on research incorporating use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. The authors said, &quot;the somatosensory integration mechanism for prioritizing tactile and proprioception feedback in this task are not disrupted by PD, and are not related to the observed proprioceptive deficits&quot;.113
Postural sway
In 2007, authors Laurie Swana, Hajime Otanib, and Peter V. Loubertc published a paper in the journal Gait &amp; Posture about use of the Hitachi Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While tesing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Hitachi Magic Wand to each leg. The authors analysed whether postural sway decreased more while simultaneously challenging the subject to perform a balance assignment or a cognitive one. Their paper concluded, &quot;Performing the difficult cognitive task, yet not the easy cognitive task, was associated with a decrease in postural sway ... The decrease was not influenced by the difficulty of the balance task. The difficulty level of the cognitive task was the critical factor that decreased sway in dual task conditions.&quot;114
Reception
Commentary
The Hitach Magic Wand received the nickname &quot;the Cadillac of vibrators&quot; from the sex shop Good Vibrations.115 Authors Anne Hooper and Philip Hodson called it: &quot;the Rolls-Royce of vibrators&quot;.116 Sex therapist Ruth Westheimer said the device was &quot;very popular among the brands of plug-in vibrators&quot;.117 Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in multiple articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm and those who had difficulty becoming aroused.118119 Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Hitachi Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.120
Rachel Kramer Bussel praised the device in a 2011 article for SexIs Magazine titled: &quot;10 Reasons The Hitachi Magic Wand is My Favorite Vibrator&quot;.121
Mobile Magazine announced in its July 2005 issue that readers had voted the Hitachi Magic Wand &quot;the No. 1 greatest gadget of all time&quot;.122 The Magic Wand won despite being included in the category that included the iPod, the telephone, and the toothbrush.123 In 2006, Melinda Gallagher and Emily Kramer, founders of women's entertainment company CAKE, awarded the device the Best Vibrator Award in their book A Piece of Cake.124 In their 2007 book The Hot Woman's Handbook they called it &quot;the mother of all vibrators&quot;.125 Gallagher and Kramer said, &quot;It can deliver powerful, reliable vibrations, not only to the clit but also to the entire external vulva. While the Hitachi Magic Wand really is great for using on the whole body to relax, Hitachi won't admit that its massive sales figures appear to add up to a lot more than demand for back massages.&quot;126
Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis recommended the device for a woman having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote, &quot;Maybe vibration will do the trick ... invest in a Hitachi Magic Wand. This 'personal massager' has been declared a guaranteed orgasm generator by thousands of women over three decades.&quot;127 McKinnis recommended the Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, saying, &quot;The 'guaranteed orgasm generator' you're looking for is the Hitachi Magic Wand by Vibratex. Since hitting the market ... the Wand remains virtually unmatched in vibrating power and durability. The genius is in its simplicity.&quot;128 Valued by users for its strength, versatility, and staying power, the device has garnered attributes such as &quot;the most recognizable sex toy on Earth&quot; from Engadget.129 Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was &quot;one of the most popular vibrators in the U.S.&quot;130 Rubel said, &quot;about 90% of the women with whom you play with sexually will very quickly orgasm with this vibrator&quot;.131
Rachel Kramer Bussel praised the device in a 2011 article for SexIs Magazine titled: &quot;10 Reasons The Hitachi Magic Wand is My Favorite Vibrator&quot;.132 She wrote, &quot;I'm not saying I don't like other toys, and I'm definitely open to trying new ones, but this is my favorite, the one I go to when I don't want to waste time, when I just want to cut to the chase, and I imagine it always will be&quot;.133 She composed her article in the form of an ode to her favorite toy.134 Her rationale for selecting the device as her favorite included its power, speed it takes her to a state of increased arousal, its lack of need for batteries, its delivery of intense clitoral sensations, and its affordability.135 Yana Tallon-Hicks described the device in a 2011 piece for the Valley Advocate. She said, &quot;The Hitachi is the secretly world famous heavyweight champ of buzzing sex toys, earning its trophy for consistently beating out even the most stubborn clitoral orgasms. This vibrator is strong&lt;U+2014&gt;iron-pumping, pulling mac trucks kind of strong.&quot;136 Valley Advocate recommended the Magic Wand in a 2012 article for overweight partners to use during sex because of its longer handle.137 In a subsequent article for the same publication, Tallon-Hicks wrote, &quot;For said women who are (un)blissfully unaware, The Hitachi Magic Wand is the mother of all vibrators. It's the President of Vibrator City and the Mayor of Vibratorsville. Originally designed as a 'back massager,' the Hitachi is pants-down the strongest vibrator ever.&quot;138
In a 2013 article for Express Milwaukee, Laura Anne Stuart said, &quot;For some people, this supercharged toy is the only thing that can ensure an orgasm. For others, it may be the fastest and least complicated route to ecstasy. It is also extremely sturdy and will last for decades.&quot;139 The Magic Wand from Vibratex won the award for &quot;Favorite Sex Toy for Women&quot; in October 2013 at The Sex Awards in California.140141142 In 2014, the magazine Women's Health featured the device in an article titled &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Sex Toys&quot;, where it was recommended for use with two partners.143
