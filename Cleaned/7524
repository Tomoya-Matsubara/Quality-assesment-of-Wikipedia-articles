ExtendSim (formerly known as Extend) is a simulation program for modeling  discrete event, continuous, agent-based, and discrete rate processes. There are four ExtendSim packages: CP for continuous processes; OR (operations research) which adds discrete event; AT (advanced technology) which adds discrete rate, a number of advanced modeling features , and Stat::Fit for statistical distribution fitting; and Suite which adds 3D animation.

Model construction
Models are created by dragging blocks from a library into a model worksheet. Blocks are connected together to create the logical flow of the model. Data for the model resides in the parameters of the blocks and in a proprietary database. New blocks can be created by combining existing blocks into a single hierarchical block or by programming a block in ExtendSim's  c-based language, ModL. The major libraries in ExtendSim are:
Library name
Purpose
Sample blocks
Value
Mathematical calculations, remote data access, statistics collection
Math, Read, Write, Mean &amp; Variance
Item
Models discrete event processes
Queue, Activity, Resource Pool, Item
Rate
Models discrete rate processes
Tank, Valve, Interchange
Plotter
Displays plots and charts
Plotter I/O, Histogram
Animation 2D 3D
Animates the model state
Animate Value, Animate 3D
Utilities
Model interface, debugging, and information
Buttons, Record Message, Memory Usage
Application areas
ExtendSim is used for modeling manufacturing, healthcare, supply chain, communications, defense, environmental, agricultural, biological, energy, reliability, service, information flow, and recreational systems. Sample applications include resource optimization for food logistics 1, six sigma process improvement for a hospital emergency department 2, communication systems 3, and manufacturing facility design 4
