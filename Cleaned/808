GU Energy Labs is a company based in Berkeley, California, in the United States, that produces performance sports nutrition products, most notably energy gels. Usually consumed during endurance events, the gels are designed to be quickly and easily digested. Other products include energy chews, brews, brew tablets, and a Roctane Ultra Endurance line that includes an energy drink formula mix and gel.
Background
Sports energy gels emerged in the United Kingdom in 1986 as a &quot;convenient, prewrapped, portable&quot; way to deliver carbohydrates during endurance events.1 Gels have a gooey texture and are sometimes referred to as &quot;goo&quot; generically.23 The gel Leppin Squeezy was distributed at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon in 1988. Once considered a &quot;cult product in clear packaging&quot;, energy gel products are now marketed in fancy packaging and come in a variety of flavors.4 The energy gel market grew during the 1990s, as professional athletes began endorsing products. Manufacturers generally encourage the consumption of multiple packets, with water, when participating in endurance events. Individual packets typically cost between 99 cents and $1.29 (as reported by the St. Petersburg Times in 2003).5
History
Bill Vaughan, a biophysicist at University of California, Berkeley,6 began working on a gel product in 1990.7 He established GU Energy Labs in Berkeley, California in 1994.8 GU Energy Labs is regarded as the first major distributor of energy gels, supplying products at the Ironman World Championship in 1996.910 According to the company, its mission is &quot;to help athletes go faster and longer than ever before&quot;.11 GU is now run by Bill's son, Brian Vaughan, who serves as president.12
In June 2011, GU moved its corporate operations and 50 employees from a 13,000-square-foot space at 1204 Tenth Street to one with 50 percent more square footage.1314 Located in Berkeley's 4th Street shopping district, the space was formerly occupied by Clif Bar, another sports nutrition company.15 The larger, 26,000-square-foot space, located at 1609 Fourth Street, affords the company an increased production capacity, with room for additional growth.1617 According to Outdoor USA Magazine, the new space provides to employees a safer bike commute, a company gym, ping-pong tables and areas designated for brainstorming and lounging.18 GU's 2011 relocation marked the first time in five years that all of its employees operated from a single location; previously, the company's operations, shipping and marketing were executed from multiple buildings throughout Berkeley. GU outsourced its shipping operations to a third party provider, &quot;for improved service and response times&quot;.19
In March 2013, GU announced the addition of sales agencies in the New England, Northeast, Rocky Mountain and Southeast regions of the United States.20 In the New England region, Up East Sales will cover the running and outdoor accounts, while New England Specialty Sports will handle the cycling market. In the Northeast, MVP Sales will cover run and outdoor retail. In the Rocky Mountain region, Mountain Source will handle the cycling, running and outdoor accounts. The running and outdoor markets in the Southeast region, which includes Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, will be covered by Venture Sports, Inc.21
