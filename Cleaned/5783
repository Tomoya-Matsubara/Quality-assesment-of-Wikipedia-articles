Biography
Family and early life
Michael Rosen was born in Harrow, London, into a Jewish family.3 Rosen's father Harold (1919&lt;U+2013&gt;2008) was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, in the United States to Communist parents and settled in the East End of London at the age of two, when his mother returned to the country of her birth.4 While a member of the Young Communist League he met Connie Isakofsky, his future wife and Michael Rosen's mother, in 1935. Harold was a secondary school teacher before becoming a professor of English at the Institute of Education, London,5 and Connie a primary school teacher before becoming a training college lecturer; she also broadcast for the BBC. Producing a programme featuring poetry, she persuaded her son to write for it, and used some of the material he submitted.6 Their ancestors came from Poland, Russia and Romania.7 Michael Rosen was brought up in Pinner, Middlesex, and went to various state schools in Pinner, Harrow, and then Watford Grammar School for Boys,8 and, having discovered the range of Jonathan Miller, thought: &quot;Wouldn't it be wonderful to know all about science, and know all about art, and be funny and urbane and all that.&quot;9 Subsequently, in his own words:
Early career
After his studies at Wadham College, Oxford, and graduation in 1969, Rosen became a graduate trainee at the BBC. Among the work that he did while there in the 1970s was presenting a series on BBC Schools television called WALRUS (Write And Learn, Read, Understand, Speak). He was also scriptwriter on the children's reading series Sam on Boffs' Island. But Rosen found working for the corporation frustrating: &quot;Their view of 'educational' was narrow. The machine had decided this was the direction to take. Your own creativity was down the spout.&quot;10
Despite previously having made no secret of his radical left-wing politics when he was originally interviewed for a BBC post, he was asked to go freelance in 1972, though in practice he was sacked despite several departments of the BBC wishing to employ him. In common with the China expert and journalist Isabel Hilton among several others at this time, Rosen had failed the vetting procedures which were then in operation. This long-standing practice was only revealed in 1985.11
In 1974 Mind Your Own Business, his first book of poetry for children, was published. In due course, Rosen established himself with his collections of humorous verse for children, including Wouldn't You Like to Know, You Tell Me and Quick Let's Get Out of Here.
Educationalist Morag Styles has described Rosen as &quot;one of the most significant figures in contemporary children's poetry&quot;. He was, says Styles, one of the first poets &quot;to draw closely on his own childhood experiences ... and to 'tell it as it was' in the ordinary language children actually use&quot;.12
Rosen played a key role in opening up children's access to poetry: both through his own writing and with important anthologies such as Culture Shock. He was one of the first poets to make visits to schools throughout the UK and further afield in Australia, Canada and Singapore.13 His tours continue to enthuse and engage school children about poetry in the present.14
Since 1990
In 1993, he gained an M.A. in Children's Literature from the University of Reading; he also holds a Ph.D. from the University of North London.15
He is well established as a broadcaster, presenting a range of documentary features on British radio. He is the presenter of BBC Radio 4's regular magazine programme Word of Mouth which looks at the English language and the way it is used.16
The English Association gave Michael Rosen's Sad Book an Exceptional Award for the Best Children's Illustrated Books of 2004, in the 4&lt;U+2013&gt;11 age range. The book was written by Michael Rosen and illustrated by Quentin Blake. It deals in part with bereavement, and followed the publication of Carrying the Elephant: A Memoir of Love and Loss which was published in November 2002 after the death of his son Eddie, who features as a child in much of his earlier poetry. In 2004 Rosen published This Is Not My Nose: A Memoir of Illness and Recovery, an account of his ten years with undiagnosed hypothyroidism; a course of drugs in 1981 alleviated the condition.17
Rosen has been involved in campaigning around issues of education and for the Palestinian cause. He has written columns for the Socialist Worker newspaper18 and spoken at conferences organised by the Socialist Workers Party.19 He stood for election in June 2004 in London as a Respect Coalition candidate.20 He is a supporter of the Republic campaign.21
In August 2010 Rosen contributed to an eBook collection of political poems entitled Emergency Verse - Poetry in Defence of the Welfare State edited by Alan Morrison22
In 2011 he collaborated with his wife, Emma-Louise Williams, to produce the film 'Under the Cranes',23 with Rosen providing the original screenplay (a 'play for voices' called 'Hackney Streets') which Williams took as a basis with which to direct the film. It premiered at the Rio Cinema, Dalston, London on 30 April 2011 as part of the East End Film Festival.24
He was formerly a Visiting Professor of Children's Literature at Birkbeck, University of London,25 where he taught Children's Literature and has devised an MA in Children's Literature, which commenced in October 2010. From September 2014 he will take up a new role at Goldsmiths, University of London as a Professor in the Department of Education Studies responsible for developing courses in children's literature.26
He is also a patron of the Shakespeare Schools Festival, a charity that enables school children across the UK to perform Shakespeare in professional theatres.27 Rosen was the subject of the BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs programme on 6 August 2006.28
Personal life
Rosen has been married three times, and is the father of five children and two stepchildren.29 Eddie, Rosen's second son, died aged 18 of meningitis on 26 April 1999. The tragedy was the inspiration for Michael Rosen's Sad Book (2004).30
Michael Rosen currently lives in Dalston in London with his third wife Emma-Louise Williams and their two children.3132

Also in the summer of 2007 he was awarded an Honorary D.Litt at the University of Exeter.37
