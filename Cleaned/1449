The Eastbourne by-election, 1925 was a by-election held on 17th June 1925 for the British House of Commons constituency of Eastbourne in East Sussex.
The by-election was caused by the resignation of the town's Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Sir George Lloyd, who was elevated to the peerage as Baron Lloyd and appointed as British High Commissioner in Egypt and the Sudan.
The result was a victory for the Conservative candidate Sir William Reginald Hall, who held the seat with nearly 60% of the votes, a smaller majority than at the 1924 general election.
