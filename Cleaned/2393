The Johns Hopkins Hospital is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, located in Baltimore, Maryland (USA). It was founded using money from a bequest by philanthropist Johns Hopkins. The Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and are the birthplace of numerous traditions including &quot;rounds&quot;, &quot;residents&quot; and &quot;housestaff&quot;.1
The Johns Hopkins Hospital is the birthplace of many medical specialties including neurosurgery, urology, gynecologic pathology, endocrinology, pediatrics,23 cardiac surgery4 and child psychiatry.567 It is widely regarded as one of the world's greatest hospitals.8 It has been ranked by U.S. News and World Report as the best overall hospital in America for 20 consecutive years.91011 The hospital's main medical campus in East Baltimore is served by the easternmost station on the Baltimore Metro Subway.
History
Johns Hopkins, a Baltimore merchant and banker, left an estate of $7 million ($123.8 million in 2009 USD) when he died on Christmas Eve 1873 at the age of seventy-eight. In his will, he asked that his fortune be used to found two institutions that would bear his name: &quot;Johns Hopkins University&quot; and &quot;The Johns Hopkins Hospital.&quot; At the time that it was made, Hopkins' gift was the largest philanthropic bequest in the history of the United States.12
Toward the end of his life, Hopkins selected twelve prominent Baltimoreans to be the trustees for the project and a year before his death, sent a letter telling them that he was giving &quot;thirteen acres of land, situated in the city of Baltimore, and bounded by Wolfe, Monument, Broadway and Jefferson streets upon which I desire you to erect a hospital.&quot; He wished for a hospital &quot;which shall, in construction and arrangement, compare favorably with any other institution of like character in this country or in Europe&quot; and directed his trustees to &quot;secure for the service of the Hospital, physicians and surgeons of the highest character and greatest skill.&quot; 13
Most importantly, Hopkins told the trustees to &quot;bear constantly in mind that it is my wish and purpose that the [hospital] shall ultimately form a part of the Medical School of that university for which I have made ample provision in my will.&quot; By calling for this integral relationship between patient care, as embodied in the hospital, and teaching and research, as embodied in the university, Hopkins laid the groundwork for a revolution in American medicine. Johns Hopkins' vision, of two institutions in which the practice of medicine would be wedded to medical research and medical education was nothing short of revolutionary.
Initial plans for the hospital were drafted by surgeon John Shaw Billings, and the architecture designed by John Rudolph Niernsee and completed by Edward Clarke Cabot of the Boston firm of Cabot and Chandler in a Queen Anne style.14 When completed in 1889 at a cost of $2,050,000 ($48.3 million in 2009 USD), the hospital included what was then state-of-the art concepts in heating and ventilation to check the spread of disease.
Many medical specialties were born at Johns Hopkins Hospital, including neurosurgery, urology, endocrinology, cardiac surgery15, pediatrics, critical care medicine, and child psychiatry.161718
The trustees obtained the services of four outstanding physicians, known as the &quot;Big Four,&quot; to serve as the founding staff of the hospital when it opened in May 1889. They were pathologist William Henry Welch, surgeon William Stewart Halsted, internist William Osler, and gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly.19
Osler, the first chief of the Department of Medicine, is credited with originating the idea of a residency, whereby recently graduated doctors receive advanced training in their specialty while treating patients under supervision; then as now, residents comprise most of the medical staff of the hospital. He also introduced the idea of bringing medical students into actual patient care early in their training; at the time medical school consisted almost entirely of lectures. He once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, &quot;He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.&quot;20
Halsted, the first chief of the Department of Surgery, established many other medical and surgical achievements at Johns Hopkins including modern surgical principles of control of bleeding, accurate anatomical dissection, complete sterility, and the first radical mastectomy for breast cancer (before this time, such a diagnosis was a virtual death sentence). His other achievements included the introduction of the surgical glove and advances in thyroid, biliary tree, hernia, intestinal and arterial aneurysm surgeries. Halsted also established the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States.
Kelly is credited with establishing gynecology as a true specialty. He created new surgical approaches to women's diseases and invented numerous medical devices, including a urinary cystoscope. He was one of the first to use radium to treat cancer.21
Welch was responsible for training many of the outstanding physicians of the day, such as Walter Reed. He also founded at Hopkins the nation's first School of Public Health.22
Additional medical achievements at Johns Hopkins include the first male-to-female sex reassignment surgery in the United States that took place in 1966 at the Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic.23 Two of the most far-reaching advances in medicine during the last 25 years were also made at Hopkins. First, the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of restriction enzymes gave birth to the genetic engineering industry. Second, the discovery of the brain's natural opiates has triggered an explosion of interest in neurotransmitter pathways and functions. Other accomplishments include the development of HeLa, the first and arguably most important line of human cells grown in culture; identification of the three types of polio virus; and the first &quot;blue baby&quot; operation, which opened the way to modern heart surgery.24
On September 16, 2010, a man shot himself and his mother and a doctor after allegedly being upset about his mother's treatment. At 11:15 a.m. (Eastern Standard Time), hospital authorities locked down some parts of the hospital and evacuated others. By 1:30 p.m., police found the shooter and his mother both dead.25
Operations
The hospital has 80,000 visitors a week. There are 80 entrances.26
