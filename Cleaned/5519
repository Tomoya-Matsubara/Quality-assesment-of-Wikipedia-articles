Iosif Romualdovich Grigulevich (&lt;U+0418&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0441&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0444&gt; &lt;U+0420&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+043C&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+044C&gt;&lt;U+0434&gt;&lt;U+043E&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt; &lt;U+0413&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0433&gt;&lt;U+0443&gt;&lt;U+043B&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0447&gt;) (May 5 1913 &lt;U+2013&gt; June 2 1988) was one of the most remarkable Soviet illegal operatives (a spy acting without diplomatic cover) during the 1930s and 1940s, when he took a leading role in assassinating leftists who were not loyal to Joseph Stalin. Under a false identity as Teodoro B. Castro, a wealthy Costa Rican expatriate living in Rome, Grigulevich served as the ambassador of the Republic of Costa Rica to both Italy and Yugoslavia (1952 &lt;U+2013&gt; 1954). His mission to assassinate Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito was aborted due to Stalin's death, after which Grigulevich settled in Moscow, where he worked as an expert on the history of Latin America and on the Roman Catholic Church. He was a member of Soviet Academy of Sciences, served as editor in chief of the magazine, Obshchestvennye nauki i sovremennost (&quot;Social Sciences Today&quot;) and published many books and articles about Latin American subjects.
Early life
Grigulevich was born in Trakai, Lithuania, to a family of Crimean Karaites. His parents immigrated to Argentina when he was young. His father did well for himself and later sent Iosif to Europe to study. However, some Russian sources state that only his father immigrated to Argentina and he and his mother remained in Poland, where he joined the Polish Communist party and became acquainted with Edward Gierek, not travelling to Argentina until 1934. In any case, in 1933 he studied briefly at the Sorbonne. He was recruited by the NKVD and showed a gift for languages, soon picking up English, Spanish, French and Russian.
Secret agent
In the late 1930s, Grigulevich was sent to Spain to monitor the activities of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM), during the course of the civil war in that country. Grigulevich worked under NKVD general Alexander Orlov, using the code names MAKS and FELIPE, and organized so-called &quot;mobile groups&quot; that killed, among other actual and suspected Trotskyists, POUM leader Andr&lt;U+00E9&gt;s Nin. In this mission Grigulevich apparently collaborated with the assassin Vittorio Vidali, known in Spain as &quot;Comandante Carlos Contreras.&quot;1
Grigulevich was summoned to Moscow in 1938. In January 1940 was sent to Mexico, under the code name &quot;Yuzek,&quot; to take part in the first, unsuccessful attempt on the life of Leon Trotsky, again in collaboration with Vittorio Vidali. Later, Grigulevich was sent to Argentina under the code name &quot;Artur&quot;, where he remained during World War II and organized anti-Nazi sabotage operations. He married a Mexican woman named Laura Araujo Aguilar, who was also a Soviet secret agent, operating under the code name LUIZA.2
Costa Rican diplomat
In 1949, with the help of Joaqu&lt;U+00ED&gt;n Guti&lt;U+00E9&gt;rrez, a Costa Rican writer who harbored pro-Soviet sympathies and who worked in his country's diplomatic corps, Grigulevich procured a false passport identifying him as Teodoro Castro Bonnefil, and settled in Rome.3 Grigulevich pretended to be the illegitimate son of a wealthy Costa Rican coffee producer and styled himself Teodoro B. Castro (using a middle initial in the &quot;American manner&quot;). He successfully established an import-export business in Rome and made extensive personal contacts with business figures and prelates of the Catholic church. He also became a friend and business partner of former Costa Rican president Jos&lt;U+00E9&gt; Figueres and in 1951 &quot;Teodoro B. Castro&quot; was appointed as charg&lt;U+00E9&gt; d'affaires of the Costa Rican embassy in Rome, serving also as advisor to the Costa Rican delegation to the sixth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, in Paris. In 1952, he was appointed as ambassador to both Italy and Yugoslavia. In the meantime, Grigulevich was secretly granted Soviet citizenship and membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.4
In early 1952, the Soviet intelligence services assigned Grigulevich the task of conducting the assassination of Yugoslav leader Tito, who had broken with Stalin in 1948 over his insistence in maintaining Yugoslav independence from Soviet control (see Tito&lt;U+2013&gt;Stalin split). In his role as the Costa Rican ambassador, Grigulevich met with Tito on several occasions, but the death of Stalin in March 1953 interrupted the assassination plans and Grigulevich was eventually summoned back to Moscow, marking the end of his career as an Soviet secret agent. In Rome, the sudden disappearance of the Costa Rican ambassador, along with his wife and daughter, created a stir, with rumors of Mafia involvement circulating in diplomatic circles.5
Historian
In Moscow, Grigulevich settled into a new life as an academic. He was awarded a doctorate in history without having to defend a thesis and worked as an expert on Latin America and the Catholic church. He was the author of 58 books, some of which were published under the pseudonym Iosif Lavretzky (&lt;U+041B&gt;&lt;U+0430&gt;&lt;U+0432&gt;&lt;U+0440&gt;&lt;U+0435&gt;&lt;U+0446&gt;&lt;U+043A&gt;&lt;U+0438&gt;&lt;U+0439&gt;). In 1979 he became a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Colleagues were puzzled by the lack of any biographical information about him prior to his forties and by his refusal to be photographed. The details of Grigulevich's role as a Soviet agent were clarified only after the fall of the communist regime, particularly with the release of the so-called &quot;Mitrokhin archive&quot; in the mid-1990s.
