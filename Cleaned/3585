The Belgian Eifel () is that part of the North and West Eifel that lies on the Belgian side of the Germany-Belgium border. The term is not universally used, because the boundary between the Eifel and the Ardennes in the area of the High Fens is not clearly defined.
The following areas may be considered part of the Belgian Eifel:
Part of the Zitterwald (western section of the North Eifel), where this upland area runs into Belgium towards B&lt;U+00FC&gt;tgenbach
The westernmost part of the Schnee Eifel (Ommerwald) and the German-speaking area around Sankt Vith
The Hohes Venn (Hautes Fagnes), although this can be considered part of the Ardennes
Geologically and geographically the Eupen Land can also be counted as part of the Eifel, even if its inhabitants would not class themselves as living within it.
A small part of the &lt;U+00D6&gt;sling (hill country in northern Luxembourg).
