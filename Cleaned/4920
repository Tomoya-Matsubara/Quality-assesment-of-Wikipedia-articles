Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217 (1959), was a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States that the state of Arizona does not have jurisdiction to try a civil case between a non-Indian doing business on a reservation with tribal members who reside on the reservation, the proper forum for such a case is the tribal court.1
Background
Paul Williams and his wife Lorena were enrolled tribal members of the Navajo tribe, and resided on the Navajo reservation in Arizona. Hugh Lee was an Indian trader who operated a trading post on the reservation. Lee was licensed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to operate the trading post and he sold goods on credit to members of the tribe. Williams bought goods on credit and did not make payment. In 1952, Lee filed a lawsuit2 in the Superior Court of Apache County, Arizona and obtained a writ of attachment for sheep belonging to Williams.{{#tag:ref|Sheep were the primary livelihood for Williams and for most members of the Navajo tribe3|group=fn}}4 Williams moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the state court did not have jurisdiction on the reservation. In the meantime, Lee was granted an order authorizing the Apache County Sheriff to sell at auction the sheep belonging to Williams. In 1954 the trial court finally issued a ruling denying the motion to dismiss and in 1955, found for Lee.5 Williams appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court.6
At the Arizona Supreme Court, Williams argued that the proper jurisdiction was the Navajo tribal court and that a state officer did not have the authority to sell the sheep. The Arizona Supreme Court held that the state did have jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving Indians and non-Indians, since there was no Congressional prohibition against it. The court did rule, however, that federal regulations prohibited the sale of Indian livestock without the approval of BIA.7 Williams then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case and issued a writ of certiorari.89
Opinion of the court
Justice Hugo Black, author of the unanimous opinion
Arguments
Norman M. Littell{{#tag:ref|Littell was the attorney for the Navajo tribe, who funded the appeal to the Supreme Court. The tribe was concerned that if the Arizona Supreme Court decision stood, that state would undermine the authority of the tribe to govern itself.1011|group=fn}} argued the case for Williams. Littell argued that Congress had plenary power to end tribal immunity but had not done so, and that other federal laws preempted state jurisdiction.12 William W. Stevenson argued the case for Lee. He argued that the Navajo tribe was a creation of the federal government, and not a long-standing tribe like the Cherokee. His position was that there was no tribal sovereignty.13 Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin filed an amicus curae brief at the request of the court, urging reversal.14 While Rankin supported reversal, he did so on narrow grounds, based on federal regulations of Indian traders.1516
Unanimous opinion
Justice Hugo Black delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. Black noted that in 1830, the state of Georgia had tried to extend its laws to the Cherokee reservation and that Worcester v. Georgia17 clearly established that state law and jurisprudence did not reach into the confines of a reservation.{{#tag:ref|Black quoted Chief Justice John Marshall, who stated &quot;The Cherokee nation . . . is a distinct community, occupying its own territory . . . in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter, but with the assent of the Cherokees themselves, or in conformity with treaties, and with the acts of congress. The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States.&quot;1819|group=fn}}20 He then stated that the question was whether, absent Congressional authorization, a state infringed on the right of the tribe to govern itself.21 The Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act2223 was designed by Congress to strengthen the tribal government and tribal courts.{{#tag:ref|Coincidentally, the same year that this case was decided, the Navajo Nation took control of its tribal courts back from the federal government.24|group=fn}} Black observed that &quot;Significantly, when Congress has wished the States to exercise this power it has expressly granted them the jurisdiction which Worcester v. Georgia had denied.&quot;25 Finally, he noted that the Navajo tribal court has jurisdiction to hear civil cases brought by non-Indians against tribal members and that no federal statute has given Arizona jurisdiction to hear such cases.{{#tag:ref|Black did note that Public Law 280 would grant Arizona such authority, but that Arizona has not moved to accept such jurisdiction.2627|group=fn}}28293031
Black stated that allowing the exercise of state jurisdiction would undermine tribal sovereignty and that only Congress had the authority to do so.323334 The case was reversed.35
Subsequent developments
Williams has been cited as the initial case in the modern era of federal Indian law.36373839 It is widely cited in cases dealing with tribal sovereignty and state infringement on tribal rights.40 Some claim that Williams formed the basis for the Indian self-determination era and for the Indian Self-Determination Act.4142 The case was also the first of a series of cases that limited Arizona's authority within the Navajo reservation.{{#tag:ref|The other cases were Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm'n43 and McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Comm'n44|group=fn}}454647 The case is considered a landmark case involving tribal sovereignty.4849
