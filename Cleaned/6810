A BLT cocktail is a cocktail made out of the contents of a BLT sandwich, (bacon, lettuce and tomato), blended together with vodka. Variants on the drink include utilizing bacon vodka instead of traditional vodka, substituting liquor for lettuce, incorporating bacon salt, or including cucumber flavored vodka.
The drink gained popularity in the United States in 2009. Varieties of the beverage were served in regions including Colorado, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, Oregon, and Virginia. It has also achieved notice in Canada and the United Kingdom.
Frank Bruni, the chief restaurant critic for The New York Times, gave a favorable review in 2007 to a BLT cocktail made by chef Gordon Ramsay. An Associated Press review in 2009 of the BLT cocktail made by mixologist Todd Thrasher of Alexandria, Virginia described it as &quot;a drink full of mind-bending, taste bud-tingling turns&quot;.1 Food critics have given the beverage favorable reviews in The Boston Globe, The Times of London, and the Toronto, Canada-based newspaper The Globe and Mail.

Analysis
In an August 2009 article for The Globe and Mail, Sarah Boesveld noted it was too difficult for individuals to make bacon vodka at home, and instead recommended they utilize bacon salt to make their own BLT cocktails or Blood Mary drinks with bacon.11 In a 2009 restaurant review by the Associated Press, they described the BLT cocktail made by mixologist Todd Thrasher of Alexandria, Virginia as, &quot;a drink full of mind-bending, taste bud-tingling turns. A huge ice cube, made with lettuce water, anchors a glass rimmed with bacon salt. Clear tomato water and bacon-infused vodka are mixed and poured over the lettuce cube.&quot;12 Metromix called this edition of the beverage, &quot;a zesty mix of bacon-infused vodka, tomato water and iceberg lettuce ice&quot;.13 Woman's Day magazine featured the concoction by Todd Thrasher in its article on &quot;the most outrageous drinks&quot; in the United States.14
