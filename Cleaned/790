   Donald Culross Peattie (June 21, 1898 - November 16, 1964) was a U.S. botanist, naturalist and author. He was described by Joseph Wood Krutch as &quot;perhaps the most widely read of all contemporary American nature writers&quot; during his heyday. 
Biography
Peattie was born in Chicago to the journalist Robert Peattie and the novelist Elia Peattie. He studied French poetry for two years at the University of Chicago and then transferred to, and graduated (1922) from Harvard University where he studied with the noted botanist Merritt Lyndon Fernald. After field work in the Southern and Mid-West United States, he worked as a botanist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (1922-1924).
He was nature columnist for the The Washington Star from 1924 to 1935.
His nature writings are distinguished by a poetic and philosophical cast of mind and are scientifically scrupulous. His best known works are the two books (out of a planned trilogy) on North American trees which he wrote in the late 1940s and early '50s. These were published as a single volume for the first time in April 2007 as A Natural History of North American Trees. (Unfortunately, this hardbound volume reduces the two books' original 257 mini-essays to only 112 and includes only 135 of Paul Landacre's original 365 woodcut illustrations.)
Peattie also produced children's and travel books, altogether totaling almost forty volumes.
