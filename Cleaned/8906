Zoogoneticus tequila, Tequila Splitfin or simply Tequila fish, is a species of goodeid fish (family Goodeidae).1 The specific epithet, tequila, derives from the Tequila Volcano, which looms near the type locality.2 It is endemic to Mexico. Its current distribution is restricted to a single spring pool in Teuchitl&lt;U+00E1&gt;n, only  in diameter, where a population consisting of less than 50 adult fish live.3 Even in this habitat, it is outnumbered by introduced guppies by a factor of six.4 Before the discovery of the pool population in 2000/2001, Zoogoneticus tequila was generally thought to inhabit rivers; however, no fish could be found in the original habitat and the species was considered extinct in the wild.5 Introduced fish species have been implicated in the disappearance of Zoogoneticus tequila from its type locality.6
Along with other Mexican goodeids, Zoogoneticus tequila are viviparous; this lead the genus to be originally included in family Poeciliidae. Males are smaller than females, with standard length up to 41 mm in males and up to 58 mm in females. The sexes can also be distinguished by colouration.7
