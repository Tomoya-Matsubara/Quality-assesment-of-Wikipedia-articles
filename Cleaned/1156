For the fictional character with this name see Grindcore (Transformers).
Grindcore, often shortened to grind, is an extreme music genre that emerged during the mid&lt;U+2013&gt;late 1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive music genres &lt;U+2013&gt; including death metal, industrial music, noise and the more extreme varieties of hardcore punk.
Grindcore is characterized by heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars,12 extreme tempos, frequently accompanied by blast beats, songs often lasting no more than two minutes (some are seconds long), and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched screams.3 Lyrical themes range from social and political issues (Napalm Death) to gore (Carcass) and humor (Anal Cunt).4 The style is most prevalent in North America and in Europe.
Characteristics
Blast beat
The blast beat is a drum beat characteristic of grindcore in all its forms,5 although its usage predates the genre itself. In Adam MacGregor's definition, &quot;the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal.&quot;6 Blast beats have been described as &quot;maniacal percussive explosions, less about rhythm per se than sheer sonic violence.&quot;7 Napalm Death coined the term,8 though this style of drumming had previously been practiced by others. Daniel Ekeroth argues that the blast beat was first performed by the Swedish D-beat group Asocial on their 1982 demo.9 D.R.I. (&quot;No Sense&quot;10), Sepultura (&quot;Antichrist&quot;11), S.O.D. (&quot;Milk&quot;12), Sarc&lt;U+00F3&gt;fago (&quot;Satanas&quot;13), Cryptic Slaughter and Repulsion14 also included the technique prior to Napalm Death's emergence.
Guitar tuning
The vinyl A-side of Napalm Death's debut, Scum, is set to standard tuning, while on side B the guitars are tuned down 2&lt;U+00BD&gt; steps. Their second album and 1989's Mentally Murdered EP were tuned to C#. Harmony Corruption, their third offering, was tuned up to a D.15 Fellow grindcore practitioners Carcass also had the habit of the downtuning their guitars - specifically, to B.16 Bolt Thrower went further than Carcass, dropping 3&lt;U+00BD&gt; steps down (A).17
Song length
One well-known characteristic of grindcore and related genres is the 'microsong': songs lasting only a few seconds. In 2001, the Guinness Book of World Records awarded Brutal Truth the record for &quot;Shortest Music Video&quot; for 1994's &quot;Collateral Damage&quot;. The song lasts 4 seconds. In 2007, the video for the Napalm Death song &quot;You Suffer&quot; set a new &quot;Shortest Music Video&quot; record: 1.3 seconds.18
Along with the microsong, it is characteristic of early grindcore to have diminutive song lengths. Such is the example of Carcass' Reek of Putrefaction (1988), where the song span averages about 1 minute and 48 seconds.19
Lyrical themes
Napalm Death's songs address a variety of anarchist concerns, in the tradition of anarcho-punk.20 These themes include anti-racism, feminism, anti-militarism, and anti-capitalism. A number of grindcore musicians remain committed to political and ethical causes.21 Other grindcore groups, such as Carcass, have expressed disgust with the body, and are famous for their vegetarianism.22 Carcass' work is sometimes identified as the origin of the goregrind style, which is devoted to these bodily themes.23 Groups that shift their bodily focus to sexual matters, such as Gut and Meat Shits are sometimes referred to as &quot;pornogrind&quot;.24 Both Anal Cunt and Pig Destroyer are controversial for their apparent misogyny.25 Seth Putnam's lyrics are notorious for their irony and black comedy,26 while The Locust and Agoraphobic Nosebleed tend toward satirical collage, indebted to William S. Burroughs' cut-up method.2728
History
Precursors
The early grindcore scene relied on an international network of tape trading and DIY production.29 The most widely acknowledged precursors of the grindcore sound are Siege,30 a hardcore punk group, and Repulsion, an early death metal outfit.31 Siege, from Weymouth, Massachusetts, were influenced by classic American hardcore (Minor Threat, Black Flag, Void) and by British groups like Discharge, Venom, and Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead.32 Siege's goal was maximum velocity: &quot;We would listen to the fastest punk and hardcore bands we could find and say, &lt;U+2018&gt;Okay, we&lt;U+2019&gt;re gonna deliberately write something that is faster than them'&quot;, drummer Robert Williams recalled.33
Repulsion, from Flint, Michigan, cited street punk groups like Discharge and Charged GBH, crossover thrash such as Dirty Rotten Imbeciles and Corrosion of Conformity, thrash metal like Slayer, Metallica, and Sodom, early black metal (Venom) and death metal (Possessed), hardcore punk, like Black Flag, and older hard rock, as inspirational.34 The group is often credited with inventing the classic grind blast beat (played at 190 bpm), as well as its distinctive bass tone.35 Shane Embury, in particular, advocates the band as the origin of Napalm Death's later innovations.36 Kevin Sharp of Brutal Truth declares that &quot;Horrified was and still is the defining core of what grind became; a perfect mix of hardcore punk with metallic gore, speed and distortion.&quot;37
Other groups in the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have emphasized the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat.38 Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, and a variety of European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer,39 and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and DRI.40 Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style.41 Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge,42 Amebix,43 Throbbing Gristle,44 and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles.45 Post-punk, such as Killing Joke46 and Joy Division,47 was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.
Napalm Death
Grindcore, as such, was developed during the mid-1980s in the United Kingdom by Napalm Death, a group who emerged from the crust punk scene.48 The name &quot;grindcore&quot; is said to have been coined by Napalm Death's second drummer, Mick Harris. When asked about coming up with the term, Harris said the following:
Other sources contradict Harris' claim. In a Spin magazine article written about the genre, Steven Blush declares that &quot;the man often credited&quot; for dubbing the style grindcore was Shane Embury, Napalm Death's bassist since 1987. Embury offers his own account of how the grindcore &quot;sound&quot; came to be:
Earache Records founder Digby Pearson concurs with Embury, saying that Napalm Death &quot;put hardcore and metal through an accelerator.&quot;49 Pearson, however, said that grindcore &quot;wasn't just about the speed of [the] drums, blast beats, etc.&quot; He claimed that &quot;it actually was coined to describe the guitars - heavy, downtuned, bleak, harsh riffing guitars [that] 'grind', so that's what the genre was described as, by the musicians who were its innovators [and] proponents.&quot;50

1980s grindcore after Napalm Death
Napalm Death's seismic impact inspired other British grindcore groups, among them Extreme Noise Terror,51 Carcass and Sore Throat.52 Early American grind practitioners included Terrorizer and Ass&lt;U+00FC&gt;ck.53 S.O.B. are recognized as the first Japanese grindcore group, first recording in 1986, and primarily influenced by Siege and early Napalm Death.54 European groups, such as Agathocles, from Belgium,55 Patareni, of Croatia, and Fear of God, from Switzerland, are also considered important early practitioners of the style.56 Filthy Christians, who signed to Earache Records in 1989, introduced the style in Sweden,57 while Cripple Bastards established Italian grindcore.58 Guilio of Cripple Bastards asserts that the name itself took some time to migrate from Britain, with the style being referred to as &quot;death-thrashcore&quot; for a time in Europe.59 The German label TNT Records began to release grindcore recordings early on, advancing the &quot;noisecore&quot; (or &quot;noisegrind&quot;) scene, exemplified by the American group Anal Cunt, described by Guilio as &quot;the most anti-musical and nihilistic face of extreme music at that time.&quot;6061
1990s U.S. grind
thumb|Brutal Truth, live at Hole In The Sky, Bergen Metal Fest 2008 Journalist Kevin Stewart-Panko argues that the American grindcore of the 1990s borrowed from three sources: British grindcore, American thrashcore, and death metal.62 As early Napalm Death albums were not widely distributed in the United States, American groups tended to take inspiration from later works such as Harmony Corruption.63 American groups also often employ riffs taken from crossover thrash or thrash metal.64 Brutal Truth was a groundbreaking group in the American scene at the beginning of the 1990s.65 However, Sharp indicates that they were more inspired by the thrash metal of Dark Angel than the British groups.66 Discordance Axis, a group without a bass player, had a more technical style of playing than many of the predecessors, and had a much more ornate visual and production style.67 Scott Hull is prominent in the contemporary grindcore scene, through his participation in Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed.68 ANb's Frozen Corpse Stuffed with Dope has been described as &quot;the Paul's Boutique of grindcore&quot;, by Village Voice critic Phil Freeman, for its &quot;hyper-referential, impossibly dense barrage of samples, blast beats, answering machine messages, and incomprehensibly bellowed rants.&quot;69 Pig Destroyer is inspired by thrash metal, such as Dark Angel and Slayer, the sludge metal of The Melvins, and grindcore practiced by Brutal Truth,70 while Agoraphobic Nosebleed takes cues from thrashcore and powerviolence, like D.R.I. and Crossed Out.71 Pig Destroyer's style is sometimes referred to as &quot;deathgrind&quot;,72 because of the prevalence of death metal influences, as are Cattle Decapitation.73 The Locust, from San Diego,74 also take inspiration from powerviolence (Crossed Out, Dropdead), first-wave screamo (Angel Hair), obscure experimental rock (Art Bears, Renaldo and the Loaf), and death metal.75 The Locust were sometimes described as &quot;hipster grind&quot; because of their fan base and fashion choices.76 Other prominent grindcore groups of the 1990s include Brujeria,77 Soilent Green,78 Cephalic Carnage,79 and Impetigo.80
Rotten Sound, a Finnish grind band, in Kuopio, 2008
1990s European grind
Nasum, who emerged from the Swedish death metal scene,81 became a popular group, addressing political topics from a personal perspective.82 Anders Jakobson, their drummer, reported that &quot;It was all these different types of people who enjoyed what we we were doing. [...] We made grindcore a bit easier to listen to at the expense of the diehard grindcore fans who thought that we were, well, not sellouts, but not really true to the original essence of grindcore.&quot;83 Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind.84 Inhume, from the Netherlands,85 and Rotten Sound, from Finland,86 were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections.
2000s
    Circle of Dead Children, from the U.S.,87 and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium,8889 played deathgrind in the new millennium. Fuck the Facts, a Canadian group, practiced classic grindcore, characterized by the &quot;metronome-precision drumming and riffing [that] abound, as well as vocal screams and growls&quot; by Allmusic reviewer Greg Prato.90 The 21st century also saw the development of &quot;electrogrind&quot; (or &quot;cybergrind&quot;),91 practiced by The Berzerker and Genghis Tron, which borrows from electronic music.92 These groups built on the work of Agoraphobic Nosebleed and The Locust, as well as industrial metal.93 The Berzerker also appropriated the distorted Roland TR-909 kick drums of gabber producers.94 Many later electrogrind groups were caricatured for their hipster connections.95
Sales
According to Nielsen Soundscan, Napalm Death sold 367,654 units between May 1991 and November 2003, while Carcass sold 220,374 units in the same period.96 The inclusion of Napalm Death's &quot;Twist the Knife (Slowly)&quot; on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility,97 as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart98 and went platinum in less than a year.99
Legacy
While abrasive, grindcore achieved a measure of mainstream visibility. As James Hoare, deputy editor of Terrorizer, writes,  Grindcore's impact quickly spread through the world of extreme music.
Industrial metal
Napalm Death's former guitarist, Justin Broadrick, went on to a career in industrial metal with Godflesh.100 Mick Harris, in his post-Napalm Death project, Scorn, briefly experimented with the style.101 Scorn also worked in the industrial hip hop102 and isolationist styles.103 Fear Factory104 have also cited debts to the genre.
Noise rock
Japanese noise rock group Boredoms took inspiration from grind,105106 and toured with Brutal Truth in 1993.107 Naked City, lead by avant-garde jazz saxophonist John Zorn, performed an avant-garde form of polystylistic, grindcore-influenced punk jazz.108109 Zorn later formed the Painkiller project with ambient dub producer Bill Laswell on bass guitar and Mick Harris on drums,110 which also collaborated with Justin Broadrick on some work.111
Powerviolence
Powerviolence was a late 1980s outgrowth of American hardcore punk that borrowed from noise music.112 The style was similar to grindcore and took inspiration from Napalm Death and other early groups, but avoided elements of heavy metal.113
Digital hardcore
The Panacea, a prominent digital hardcore musician, describes himself as &quot;the digital version of Napalm Death.&quot;114 Agoraphobic Nosebleed and the Locust have also solicited remixes from digital hardcore producers and noise musicians.115116 James Plotkin, Dave Witte, and Speedranch participated in the Phantomsmasher project, which melds grindcore and digital hardcore. Alec Empire collaborated with Justin Broadrick, on the first Curse of the Golden Vampire album,117 and with Gabe Serbian, of the Locust, live in Japan.118 Japanoise icon Merzbow also participated in the Empire/Serbian show,119 and has frequently mentioned his appreciation for grindcore.120
Metalcore
Coalesce, an early metalcore group, released a split 7&quot; with Napalm Death in 1997.121 Subsequently, mathcore groups122123 such as Dillinger Escape Plan,124 Some Girls,125 and Daughters,126127 and screamo groups,128 like Circle Takes the Square and Orchid,129 have been associated with grindcore by some commentators. These groups also include elements of post-hardcore.130 By 2009, deathcore bands began to describe themselves as grindcore, but have been met with criticism.131
