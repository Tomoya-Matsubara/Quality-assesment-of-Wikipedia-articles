The Prima apple is one of the modern disease resistant cultivars of domesticated apple which was bred by the PRI disease resistant apple breeding program in 1958.1
Like other &quot;PRI&quot; apples it is of complex ancestry to ensure the utmost disease resistance and various cultivation advantages, along with a fresh vibrate flavor. It includes the Rome Beauty, Melba, Golden Delicious and Wealthy apples, as well as the Malus floribunda crabapple for scab resistance. &quot;PRI&quot; is impressed in the cultivars name &quot;PRI&quot;ma.2
It is very resistant to apple scab and have some resistance against the other common diseases. It has a juicy flesh with a balanced mild sub-acid flavour, a red flushed skin over yellow background.3 It doesn't fall off the tree, and like most early harvest apple it doesn't keep well, even with refrigeration.4
