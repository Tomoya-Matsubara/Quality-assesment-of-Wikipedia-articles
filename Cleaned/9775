America's Sweetheart is the 2004 solo debut from Courtney Love. The release of this album was delayed for three years and preceded by much negative publicity over Courtney's legal problems and drug issues.
America's Sweetheart featured Courtney working with hitmaker Linda Perry (P!nk, Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani) and Bernie Taupin, famous for his collaborations with veteran rocker Elton John.
The album received many positive reviews, but is considered to be a weaker release from Love. It sold modestly; about 140,000 copies in the U.S. and a little over a quarter of a million worldwide. The first single taken from the album, &quot;Mono&quot;, was released in February of 2004. The song experienced good airplay in the U.S., but it achieved higher chart positions in other countries such as the U.K. &quot;Hold on to Me&quot; was a minor hit in several areas. Also, some countries played other songs from the album that were not released as official singles such as &quot;All the Drugs&quot;; however, these songs were quite well-received.
Non-US versions of the album features uncredited Brody Dalle and Kim Deal on a different recording of &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; (with slightly altered lyrics), singing and playing guitar. Dalle claims she is also a co-writer of the song.
The original recordings were made at a ch&lt;U+00E2&gt;teau in the South of France and then shopped around to four different labels. It seemed Love was likely to sign with UK label Poptones, but instead signed to Virgin Records, who offered her a $20 million record deal. However, upon purchasing the album, Virgin demanded that the album be re-recorded so it would make their fiscal-year deadline of March 31. Courtney, who was at rehab at that time, was brought back and forth from the health center by the record company, did not improve at her then addiction battle and became overwhelmed by the compulsory work.1 Besides it all, Love later revealed to Rolling Stone that she &quot;never saw a penny&quot; from the advance that Virgin paid her for America's Sweetheart.
Also, between the several controversies involving America's Sweetheart release, Courtney accuses Virgin Records for putting the work out before it was finished. According to her, the record company chose the songs, the cover, the recorded vocals and the final arrangements without her participation: &quot;...I made five good songs. I had twelve songs, but they're not on the album. I had no creative control.&quot;2 And to make it worse, according to BMI and ASCAP's websites, four of the songs on the album (&quot;But Julian I'm a Little Bit Older Than You&quot;, &quot;Almost Golden&quot; and both singles, &quot;Mono&quot; and &quot;Hold on to Me&quot;) weren't officially registered for copyright collect. By late 2006, the legal status of all of them seemed to have been corrected.
Love demonstrated her extreme regret about the record in a September 2006 interview, in which she declared that &quot;the sound on A.S. sucked beyond words. The production was a nightmare. Linda and I had written some really good songs, but they were rendered lazily and sound like shit. The art was horrific and not my idea and the label didn't back it at all. I was busy taking drugs to dull the pain of having lost everything AND made a shit album to boot (...) The producer didn't know what he was doing and he just spent my money. It almost had a moment of being Exile on Main Street - almost - but that's like almost winning a race. You either do or you do not. And in this case it's a delightfully written record in parts and sonically untenable with two of the most pretentious songs I have ever written. I was so druggy I thought it'd be cute to rip off &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; on &quot;I'll Do Anything&quot;. Believe it or not, &quot;All the Drugs&quot;, &quot;Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Mono&quot; and &quot;But Julian...&quot; are all good songs. They just were produced crap and the songs weren't taken further than demo status. {...} The art still makes me seethe. At least make it look cool, and instead there's me as a playboy pinup. I love Olivia's art but that was personal for me - not art for a record.&quot;
However, her outlook on this album was not always this negative, as in 2004 when Courtney stated, &quot;[America's Sweetheart is] good. It took forever, so it better be good.&quot;3
