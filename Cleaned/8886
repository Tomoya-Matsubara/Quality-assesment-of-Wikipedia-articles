The shads or river herrings make up the genus Alosa, fish related to herring in the family Clupeidae. They are distinct from others in that family by having a deeper body and spawning in rivers. Several species can be found on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Alosa can also be found throughout the Caspian Sea.1 Many are found in freshwater during spawning and some are only found in landlocked freshwater.
Appearance
Alosa species are generally dark on the back and top of the head, with blue, violet, or greenish tints.2 However, some can be identified as having a grey or green back.3 Spots are commonly found behind the head, and the fins may vary from species to species or individually.4 Most species of Alosa weigh  or less, with one species, Alosa pontica, weighing up to 2 kilograms.5
Biology
Shads are thought to be unique among the fishes in having evolved an ability to detect ultrasound (sound at frequencies above 20 kHz, which is the limit of human hearing).6 This was first discovered by fisheries biologists studying a type of shad known as blueback herring, and was later verified in laboratory studies of hearing in American shad. This ability is thought to help them avoid dolphins that find prey using echolocation. Alosa are generally pelagic.7 They are mostly anadromous or semianadromous with the exception of strictly freshwater landlocked species.8 Alosa species are generally migratory and schooling fish.9 Males will usually mature about a year before females; they spawn in the late spring to summer months.1011 Most individuals die shortly after spawning.1213 Alosa species are seemingly very adaptive vertebrates and can change readily to adapt to their environments, as species are found in a variety of temperatures and waters.14
Life cycle and reproduction
As Alosa species are generally anadromous, they are faced with various obstacles to survival.15 They may have to pass through numerous barriers and waters to get to either their spawning grounds or normal habitats (the sea in most cases).16 Estuaries are a major factor in numerous Alosa species migration.17 Estuaries can be highly variable and complex environments contributing to fluctuating biological interactions,18 with shifts in osomolarity, food sources, predators, etc.19 Since many adult Alosa species die after spawning, the young generally have to migrate to the sea from the spawning grounds.20 Duration of migration varies among fish, but it can greatly affect survival.21
Reproduction varies by species.22Studies done on Alosa in Iranian waters have shown that spawning varies in time, place, and temperature of the waters they inhabit.23Fecundity may also vary.24Species are known to spawn as early as April or as late as August.25 Temperatures range from about 11 to 27&lt;U+00B0&gt;C.26 Fecundity can range from 20,000 eggs to 312,000 eggs.27 Eggs are pelagic.28
The life span of Alosa species can be up to 10 years, but this is generally uncommon, as many die after spawning.29
Systematics
 Systematics of shads is complex. The genus inhabits a wide range of habitats, and many taxa are migratory. A few forms are land-locked, including one from Killarney in Ireland and two from lakes in northern Italy. Some species are native to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, as well as the Persian Gulf. Alosa species of the Caspian are systemically characterized by the number of rakers on the first gill arch by some scientists.30 They are classified as being &quot;multirakered,&quot; &quot;medium-rakered,&quot; or &quot;oligorakered.&quot;31 The multirakered are primarily plankton feeders, the oligorakered have large rakers and are predators, and the medium-rakered generally possess a mixed diet.32 Most current species of the Alosa genus in North America can be found in Florida, although Florida may not be the only place where these species are found.33
Morphology is notoriously liable to adapt to changing food availability in these fish. Several taxa seem to have evolved quite recently, making molecular analyses difficult. In addition, it appears as if hybridization is a factor to be reckoned with when researching shad phylogeny.34

Nonetheless, some trends are emerging. The North American species except the Atlantic shad can probably be separated in a subgenus (or even genus) Pomolobus. On the other hand, the proposed genus (or subgenus) Caspialosa for the Caspian Sea forms is rejected due to paraphyly.35

Management
Shad populations have been in decline for years due to spawning areas blocked by dams, habitat destruction, pollution, and overfishing. Management of shad has called for more conservative regulations, as well as policies to help the species obtain a lower fishing mortality.37
Political significance
Shad serve a peculiar symbolic role in Virginia state politics. On the year of every gubernatorial election, would-be candidates, lobbyists, campaign workers, and reporters gather in the town of Wakefield, Virginia for shad planking. American shad served as the focal point of John McPhee's book The Founding Fish.38
