Spider-Man Unlimited is an endless runner video game developed and published by Gameloft based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man. In the game, the player controls the title character and his alternate versions on his fight against the members of the Sinister Six and their multiverse counterparts. Although an endless runner, the main mode features definitive goals in constrat to the traditional aim of running as far as possible to get the highest score as possible. The game is also known for regularly having special, time-limited community events.
First announced in June 2014, Spider-Man Unlimited was released for Apple iOS, Android OS and Windows Phone on September 10, 2014. Starting from October 2014, Gameloft released four free updates that added new chapters to the story mode, Spider-Men and Spider-Women, enemies, events and stages. Since its release, it has been downloaded 30 million times and has been well-received by gaming critics. Reviewers praised controls, audio, animation, and the variety of characters, while criticized its energy system that they considered a limit to the playability.
Plot
After Spider-Man defeated a figure known as the Gold Goblin, Nick Fury tells him that the Green Goblin assembled a multiverse Sinister Six by a portal and plans to take over Spider-Man's dimension. S.H.I.E.L.D then used the portal to bring alternative versions of Spider-Man to aide the battle. Spider-Man goes after the Goblin and his alternative versions (Gold Goblin, Grey Goblin, Menace, House of M Goblin). After he defeated his arch-enemy's alternative versions, he fights various Vultures (Classic Vulture, Ultimate Vulture, Red Vulture, Dark Vulture). Electro and his alternatives versions (Classic Electro, Ultimate Electro, Modern Electro, Pure Energy Electro), Sandman and his alternate versions (Classic Sandman, Noir Sandman, Dark Sandman, and Pure Sand Sandman), and Doctor Octopus as well as the Sinister Soldiers (armored soldiers working for the Multiverse Sinister Six).

However, those looking for a high quality auto-runner, or fans of the genre keen for a change of scenery, will find a lot to like.&quot;92
Controls responsiveness was praised by Squires, Willington, and McElroy,939495 and its intuitiveness was remarked by Download.com staff.96 Musgrave and Willington praised voice acting, with the first also praising the music and the former, the sound effects;9798 animation was commended by Musgrave, Willington, and McElroy, with Musgrave and Willington commenting on the comic book-like style99100 and Musgrave and McElroy on the varied environments.101102 Squires said it has &quot;a perfect mix of speed, humor, missions, and collectibles,&quot;103 while McElroy and Download.com staff highlighted the possibility of having collectible Spider-Men.104105 The variability between running, swinging, climbing and freefalling was praised by Squires and Musgrave; the former stated, &quot;The result is a game that continues to feel fresh long after the hundredth play.106
A problem found by Squires was the level cap limit when one is using only a character, which will &quot;grate&quot; some players.107 Musgrave affirmed &quot;the art style does sometimes hinder the gameplay.&quot;108 Willington was critical of the story mode, which he argued had a &quot;weak plot&quot; and lacked character development.109 Download.com staff also noted some lags and bugs;110 Musgrave and Allen deemed the control as problematic sometimes to recognize swipes.111112 However the energy system was &quot;the biggest point of controversy,&quot; as wrote Musgrave;113 he criticized it as well as did Willington, Allen, and Mike Fahey of Kotaku.114115116 On the other hand, McElroy noted the energy system is a &quot;microtransaction hook&quot; but that it is easily surmountable without spending any real money.117 Squires also pondered that because of the time a run lasts it &quot;ends up feeling a lot fairer in practice than it sounds on paper.&quot;118
