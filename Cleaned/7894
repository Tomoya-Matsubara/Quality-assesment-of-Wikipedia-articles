&quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot; is a hit single by the English progressive rock band The Moody Blues. It was written by the band's bassist John Lodge, and was first released on the Moody Blues 1968 album In Search of the Lost Chord, and was one of two singles from that album, the other being &quot;Voices in the Sky.&quot; On the album, Ride My See-Saw is the second track, and is preceded by Graeme Edge's poem &quot;Departure.&quot; &quot;Departure&quot; ends with hysterical laughter, which then segues into Ride My See-Saw. The single was released later in 1968, and the opening laughter from &quot;Departure&quot; was removed for the single release.
