 Pont Cysylltau is a 17th-century road bridge crossing the River Dee near the village of Trevor, Wrexham County, Wales. It lies 200m west of Thomas Telford's Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.
The stone bridge is dated '1697', though it was substantially rebuilt during the 18th-century and only the south arch and part of the south pier are original.1 The bridge comprises of three arches, with full height triangular cutwaters between each arch, each topped by a pedestrian refuge. In recent years the bridge has been continually damaged by motor vehicles.2
The bridge became a Grade I listed structure in 1963 and is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument.3
