Noel Newman Lombard Craig (1884&lt;U+2013&gt;1968) was an Irish soldier who served in the First World War. He was decorated on several occasions including Distinguished Service Order, Legion of Honour, Order of the British Empire1 and the Sword of Honour.2
Early life
Craig was born in 1884, presumably in Ireland. He was given the nickname &quot;Bungo&quot; by his older brother, after he put a cat into a toilet as a child. He attended Trinity College, Dublin to study politics, graduating with a B.A. in 1905.3 He enlisted into the Cameron Highlanders in 1906, later transferring to The Royal Munster Fusiliers.4 During his training Craig was awarded the Sword of Honour for excellence in military training.
Military and Decorations
Whilst a member of the Royal Munster Fusiliers, Craig served in India until 1913. He fought at the Battle of Messines. In June 1917, at Wytschaete, he was the only one of a group of officers to survive German shelling.5
During World War II, Craig was a Military attach&lt;U+00E9&gt; and was posted to Norway, Finland, Spain, and Denmark, with his activities earning him a place on the Nazi blacklist.6 Craig was awarded a number of honours including the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and becoming a member of the French Legion of Honour.
Later life
Craig married Marian Eleanor Quinby in 1926, having at least one child, a daughter Clemency.7 Craig retired from the British diplomatic service in 1954, returning to London to practice law at King&lt;U+2019&gt;s Inn. He was also a published author, writing several novels and over fifty short stories,8 including Gulfs (1932).9 Quinby was a native of Titusville, Pennsylvania, with Craig appearing to retire there later in life.1011
