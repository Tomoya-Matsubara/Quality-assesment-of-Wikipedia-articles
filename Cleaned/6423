Tomahawk is an experimental alternative metal/alternative rock supergroup from the United States. They formed in 2000 when Fant&lt;U+00F4&gt;mas, ex-Mr. Bungle and Faith No More singer/keyboardist Mike Patton and ex-The Jesus Lizard guitar player Duane Denison started swapping tapes with the intention of collaborating. Denison then recruited ex-Helmet drummer John Stanier, while Mike Patton recruited Melvins/Cows bass player Kevin Rutmanis into the group.
History
When Faith No More broke up in 19981 Mike Patton created the record label Ipecac Recordings, returned to work with his other band Mr. Bungle, and formed the experimental metal supergroup Fant&lt;U+00F4&gt;mas with Buzz Osborne of Melvins and Dave Lombardo of Slayer. Patton met Duane Denison in 2000 at a Mr. Bungle concert in Nashville and the two began exchanging music and jamming.2
In 2001, the band released their eponymous debut album, which was produced by Joe Funderburk. Sophomore album Mit Gas, recorded with producer Joe Barresi, was released in 2003.
Tomahawk have toured extensively, playing in many countries around the world, including the United States, Australia, Europe and Japan. They generally headline shows but have been the supporting act for bands such as Tool. When opening for Tool in 2002, the band were booed off stage.34 Tomahawk took part in the &quot;Geek Tour&quot;, which featured labelmates The Melvins and Fant&lt;U+00F4&gt;mas. Tomahawk have also played at various festivals, including the Big Day Out festival in Australia.5  The band's third album, Anonymous, was released on June 19, 2007 through Ipecac Recordings. Kevin Rutmanis left the band during the recording; reasons for his departure are unknown. 6
In July, 2011, Mike Patton announced that Tomahawk was preparing to record its fourth album.7 In early 2012, Tomahawk announced that Trevor Dunn (Mr. Bungle, Fant&lt;U+00F4&gt;mas, John Zorn, MadLove, trio-convulsant) would play bass for the band.8
