The fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files commenced airing on the Fox network in the United States on October 4, 1996, concluding on the same channel on May 18, 1997, and contained 24 episodes. Following the filming and airing of the season, production began on The X-Files feature film, which was scheduled to be released in 1998 following the show's fifth season.
The fourth season of the series focused heavily on FBI federal agents Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) and his partner Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) investigation of an alien conspiracy, which is protected by the mysterious Syndicate. Midway through the season, Scully is diagnosed with terminal cancer, a result of her previous abduction, and Mulder begins to lose his faith in the idea of extraterrestrials. The season ends on a cliffhanger, with the purported suicide of Mulder.
Debuting with high viewing figures and ranking as the twentieth most watched television series during the 1996&lt;U+2013&gt;97 television year in the United States, the season was a success, with figures averaging around 20 million viewers an episode. This made it, at the time, the highest rated season of The X-Files to air. The season's twelfth episode, &quot;Leonard Betts&quot; was chosen as the Fox lead-out program following Super Bowl XXXI, and was viewed by 29.1 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode in the series' run. Critical reception from television critics was mostly positive.
Plot overview
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When the Syndicate suspect that one of their members is passing information to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able to pass along the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder&lt;U+2014&gt;Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.12 Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is working with the Russians.345
Having been diagnosed with cancer, Scully is unsure of her future with the FBI. Mulder is convinced that her condition is a result of her earlier abduction (&quot;Ascension&quot;), and is prepared to make a deal with the Syndicate to find a cure. He is dissuaded by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who secretly makes such a deal instead.67 While being pursued by an assassin responsible for a hoax alien corpse discovered on a mountaintop, Mulder fakes his own suicide, mutilating the assassin's face to provide a decoy body. He uses the distraction this offers to infiltrate The Pentagon to find a cure for Scully's cancer, while Scully is able to uncover and reveal a Syndicate connection within the FBI.891011
Production
Writing
 The season saw drastic changes to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, &quot;Herrenvolk&quot;, Williams&lt;U+2014&gt;the actor who played Mulder's informant X&lt;U+2014&gt;was written out of the show. He said that, &quot;Carter called me up personally [and said] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring you up for another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet.&quot; 12 The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be &quot;more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman&quot;, noting that he &quot;wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically.13 &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; also introduced the killer bees, who would go on to play a larger part in the 1998 movie.14
The season is notable in that it introduced a story arc about Scully developing terminal cancer, which would not be resolved until the beginning of the fifth season. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal.15 Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as &quot;a cheap TV thing&quot;. However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an &quot;obligatory&quot; move to have Scully follow suit.16
Following the cancellation of the Fox television series Space: Above and Beyond, Carter called the series' creators Glen Morgan and Wong&lt;U+2014&gt;who had previously been writers for the first two seasons of The X-Files&lt;U+2014&gt;and asked if they wanted to rejoin the series. Morgan told Carter that the two of them would rejoin, but only for four episodes, and only if they could use members for the cast of Space: Above and Beyond, so that &quot;the world can finally see them&quot;.17 Carter accepted this condition, and the two dutifully provided four of the seasons episodes.18
Filming
The season finale, &quot;Gethsemane&quot;, was notable in that an entire set created to emulated icy caverns was constructed inside a warehouse which had previously been used for cold storage;19 and required the use of truckloads of lumber and  of Styrofoam. The set would become one of the most expensive and elaborate built during the series' history.20 The set required a constant temperature of  in order to maintain the real snow and ice used to decorate it. This refrigeration allowed the actors' breath to visibly fog up, and allowed the cast to &quot;have a place that feels real&quot; to aid their acting.21 The outdoor scenes for the episode were filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather conditions making shooting difficult enough to require an extra day of work.22
Although the series' 1998 movie would take place after the events of the fifth season, the movie was actually filmed in the hiatus between the show's fourth and fifth season and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show's fifth season.23
Crew
Series creator Chris Carter also served as executive producer and showrunner and wrote eight episodes. Howard Gordon continued as executive producer and wrote five episodes for his final season on the series. Spotnitz was promoted to co-producer and wrote seven episodes. Vince Gilligan was promoted to co-producer and wrote five episodes. Former X-Files writers Glen Morgan and James Wong returned after an one season absence from the series as consulting producers and wrote three episodes together, with Morgan writing an additional episode solo that Wong directed. John Shiban was promoted to story editor and wrote four episodes. David Greenwalt joined mid-season as co-executive producer and wrote one episode for his only season on the series. Writing team Valerie and Vivian Mayhew wrote one freelance episode. Executive producer and frequent series director R. W. Goodwin wrote his first and only episode for the series. Other producers included producer Joseph Patrick Finn, co-producer Paul Rabwin, and consulting producer Ken Horton, who joined the series with this season.24
Producing-directors for the show included Rob Bowman and Kim Manners, who directed the bulk of the episodes for the season. Manners directed eight episodes, while Bowman directed seven. Executive producer R. W. Goodwin again directed the season premiere and finale. James Charleston directed three episodes, while Tucker Gates, Michael Lange, Cliff Bole, and series writer James Wong each directed one episode.25

Reviews
The fourth season of The X-Files received largely positive reviews from television critics, although several critics noted that the season was not as good as its predecessors. The Contra Costa Times noted that The X-Files during its fourth year was creatively good and &quot;always fascinating even when it's frustrating.&quot;39 Rick Kushman Bee of the Sacramento Bee wrote that Fox' Sunday block of The Simpsons, King of the Hill and The X-Files was televisions &quot;real 'Must See TV'&quot;.40 Matt Roush of USA Today wrote that the fourth season was not the series' best year, but &quot;when good, [The X-Files is] still shockingly great&quot;.41 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave an overall positive review of the season and wrote that the many of the episodes dabbled in existentialism. However, he also contended that many of the mythology episodes&lt;U+2014&gt;especially the season finale&lt;U+2014&gt;began to have &quot;a ring of familiarity to&quot; them and that &quot;the repetition is getting old&quot;.42
Episodic reviews were diverse. Some episodes were praised. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen, rated the episodes &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Unruhe&quot;, &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Small Potatoes&quot; five stars out of five.43 Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique also awarded &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;, &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Small Potatoes&quot; perfect scores of four out of four.44 Tom Kessenich named &quot;Memento Mori&quot; the fourth best episode of the series, writing that it was the definitive example of Mulder and Scully's devotion for each other.&quot;.45 He also wrote highly of &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;, Small Potatoes&quot;, and &quot;Never Again&quot;, ranking them as the fifth, eleventh, sixteenth, and twenty-fourth best episodes of The X-Files, respectively.46 Other episodes were derided. Shearman and Pearson called &quot;El Mundo Gira&quot; an &quot;aching unambitious take on Latin American culture&quot; and &quot;rubbish&quot;.47 Vitaris summaried &quot;Unrequited&quot; as a &quot;slight story that collapses under the weight of its message&quot;.48
&quot;Gethsemane&quot; created intense media speculation about whether or not Mulder was actually dead. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in The New Yorker a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's &quot;death&quot;.49 Series creator Chris Carter noted that &quot;the whole plot line of 'Gethsemane' revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations in this show. And it's an amazing thing that we could get people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him&quot;.50 UGO Networks listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of &quot;TV's Best Season Finales&quot;, noting that it &quot;rocked the core of the series' entire mythology&quot;.51
Accolades
The fourth season earned the series twelve Primetime Emmy Award nominations, with three wins. Anderson won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, after being nominated the previous year. The episodes &quot;Memento Mori&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; won for Outstanding Art Direction for a Series and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, respectively.

Other nominations were Jim Gross and Heather MacDougall each being nominated for Outstanding Editing for a Series &lt;U+2013&gt; Single Camera Production for the episodes &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; and &quot;Terma&quot;, respectively; Outstanding Makeup for a Series for &quot;Leonard Betts&quot;; Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series for &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;; and Mark Snow being nominated for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) for &quot;Paper Hearts&quot;.52 The series also won its second Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series &lt;U+2013&gt; Drama, while Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny won in the television series drama acting categories.53
