HMS Ark Royal pennant number&nbsp;91 was an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that served in the Second World War. 
Designed in 1934 to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, Ark Royal was built by Cammell Laird Cammell Laird and Company, Ltd. at Birkenhead Birkenhead, England, and completed in November 1938. Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers. Ark Royal was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull, instead of an add-on or part of the wikt:superstructure superstructure. Designed to carry a large number of aircraft, she had two hangar deck levels. She served during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power; a number of carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard Ark Royal.
Ark Royal served in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War. She was involved in the first aerial and U-boat kills of the war, Allied campaign in Norway operations off Norway, the Last battle of the battleship Bismarck search for the German battleship Bismarck, and the Malta Convoys. Ark Royal survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a 'lucky ship'. The Germans incorrectly reported her as sunk on multiple occasions.
She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the German submarine Unterseeboot 81 1941 U-81 and sank the following day. Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries; investigators were keen to know how the carrier was lost, given there were efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at Gibraltar. They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss, which were rectified in new British carriers. 
Her wreck was discovered by a BBC crew in December 2002, approximately convert 30 nmi km from Gibraltar.
Design
In 1923, the Admiralty prepared a 10-year building programme which included an aircraft carrier and 300&nbsp;aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=434 The economic downturn following the First World War caused it to be postponed. In 1930, the Director of Naval Construction, Sir Arthur Johns, began to update the plans for the carrier by incorporating recently-developed technology. His aim was to increase the number of aircraft carried by shortening the landing and take-off distances of aircraft by using arresting gear arrestor gear and Aircraft catapult compressed steam catapults respectively, which would make more deck space available for storage and aircraft preparation. Along with the inclusion of two hangar decks, this allowed Ark Royal to carry up to 72&nbsp;aircraft, although the development of larger and heavier aircraft during the carrier's construction meant that the actual number carried was between 50 and 60.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=4851 The hangar decks were placed inside the hull, thus benefiting from the protection of the convert 4.5 in mm belt armour. Three lifts were to move aircraft between the hangars and the flight deck.
File:HMS Ark Royal 19sb2j1.jpg thumb left Ark Royal's flight deck overhangs the stern. Her unusual height above the waterline is visible in comparison with the tugboat.
Another feature was the length and height of the flight deck. At convert 800 ft m, the flight deck was convert 118 ft m longer than the keel; the latter dictated by the length of Royal Navy dry-docks in Gibraltar and Malta. Because hangar decks were within the hull, the flight deck rose to convert 66 ft m above the waterline.
The Washington Naval Treaty Washington and London Naval Treaty London Naval Treaties, which restricted warship tonnage for a number of the Great Powers, were to expire at the end of 1936.Ref_label A a none With a potential naval arms race developing between Britain, Japan and Italy, the Her Majesty's Government British government sought a Second London Naval Treaty second treaty, which included limiting the maximum displacement of an aircraft carrier to 22,000&nbsp;tons.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=489 Ark Royal would have to fit this anticipated limit; to conserve weight, armour plating was limited to the belt, engine rooms, and Magazine artillery magazines, while welding instead of riveting 65% of the hull saved 500&nbsp;tons. Installation of an armoured flight deck was not possible, as the weight would have placed Ark Royal above the proposed limit, while reducing her endurance and stability.
The ship was fitted with six boilers, which powered three Parsons geared turbines. The turbines were connected via three driveshafts to three bronze propellers convert 16 ft m in diameter, to produce a maximum theoretical speed of convert 30 kn.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=47 Speed was important, as with catapults and arrestor gear, Ark Royal would have to turn into the wind to launch and recover aircraft. To avoid endangering other ships with the frequent course changes associated with flight operations, Ark Royal would have to break away from accompanying ships, and catch up on completion. Additionally, as the carrier was not armed for ship-to-ship combat, speed was her main protection against enemy warships.
Construction
The deteriorating international situation by 1933, typified by Germany's rearmament and the expansion of Japan and Italy, convinced the British to announce funds for the carrier's construction in the 1934 budget proposals.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=45 The plans finalised by November 1934, and were tendered in February 1935 to Cammell Laird Cammell Laird and Company, Ltd., which calculated the cost of the hull at British pound 1,496,250 Formatprice Inflation UK 1496250 1935 CURRENTYEAR r=-4 as of CURRENTYEAR,Inflation-fn UK and the main machinery at approximately 500,000.cite web  last=Mason  url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-04CV-Ark%20Royal.htm  title=HMS Ark Royal - Fleet Aircraft Carriercite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=456Formatprice Inflation UK 500000 1935 CURRENTYEAR r=-4 as of CURRENTYEAR,Inflation-fn UK The overall cost was estimated to be over 3&nbsp;million, making Ark Royal the most expensive ship ordered by the Royal Navy.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  page=46 Construction began on Job No.&nbsp;1012 when Ark Royal's keel was laid down on 16 September 1935.cite book  last=Colledge & Warlow  title=Ships of the Royal Navy  pages=21
File:HMS Ark Royal 91 just after launching.jpg thumb left Ark Royal immediately after launching. The lifts on the flight deck and the anti-aircraft positions on the hull are visible.
Ark Royal spent nearly two years in the builder's yard before being launched on 13 April 1937 by Lady Maud Hoare, wife of Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood Sir Samuel Hoare, then Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty First Lord of the Admiralty. The bottle of champagne thrown against Ark Royal's bows did not smash until the fourth attempt.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=41 The carrier spent a year fitting out, was handed over to her first commander, Arthur John Power Captain Arthur Power, on 16 November 1938, and was commissioned on 16 December. Although intended for the Far East, events in Europe during the carrier's construction, including the Second Italo-Abyssinian War Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and the Spanish Civil War in 1936, caused the Admiralty to mark her for deployment with the Home Fleet Home and Mediterranean Fleet United Kingdom Mediterranean Fleets.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=612 After her crew joined at the end of 1938, Ark Royal underwent sea trials to prepare for service, during which the carrier proved capable of sailing above her theoretical speed, reaching over convert 31 kn km/h.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=16
Armament and aircraft
Ark Royal's armament was designed with anti-aircraft warfare in mind, as aircraft were expected to be the main threat; ships and submarines could be outrun or dealt with by escorts.cite book  last=Westwood  title=Fighting Ships of World War Two  pages=66cite book  last=Rossiter   title=Ark Royal  pages=47 Her main armament was sixteen QF 4.5 inch naval gun quick-firing 4.5&nbsp;inch anti-aircraft guns in eight double turrets, four on each side of the hull, controlled by four Gun Director Directors using the High Angle Control System.cite book  last=Bishop & Chant  title=Aircraft carriers  pages=45 The original design placed the turrets low on the hull, but was later altered to locate them just below the flight deck, which increased each turret's field of fire weaponry field of fire. SixFriedman, British Carrier Aviation, Appendix A. Ark Royal entered service with four 8 barreled mountings, but by October 1941 all six mountings were in place. 8-barrelled QF 2 pounder naval gun 2&nbsp;pounder 1.5&nbsp;in pom-poms were located on the flight deck, in front of and behind the superstructure island, while eight 4-barrelled .50&nbsp;calibre 12.7&nbsp;mm machine guns were installed on small projecting platforms to the front and rear of the flight deck.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=478
Sixteen Fleet Air Arm squadrons were posted aboard Ark Royal during her career; an average of five squadrons at any time. On entering service, most of Ark Royal's squadrons were equipped with either Blackburn Skuas, used as fighters and dive bombers, or Fairey Swordfishes, for reconnaissance and torpedo bombing. From April 1940, squadrons equipped with Skuas were upgraded to Fairey Fulmars; like their predecessors, these were used as fighters and bombers. On occasion, the carrier operated Blackburn Roc fighter-bombers from April 1939 to October 1940 and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers during October 1941; these were replacement aircraft used to boost squadron numbers.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=112  In June 1940, Ark Royal was host to 701 Naval Air Squadron, a training squadron which operated Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance amphibious aircraft amphibians.

Service history
With the hunter-killer groups
File:Declaration of war naval message.jpg thumb right The message sent to the ship informing her of the commencing of hostilities on 3 September 1939
The outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939 had been presaged by Germany's U-boat fleet taking up positions off the British coast, where they could intercept British shipping. Within hours of the war starting, the passenger ship SS Athenia SS Athenia was torpedoed by Unterseeboot 30 1936 U-30,cite book  last=Edwards  title=Dnitz and the wolf packs  pages=18 the first of over 65,000&nbsp;tons of shipping sunk by U-boats during the first week of the war.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=747 Ark Royal was deployed with the Home Fleet in the Western Approaches North Western Approaches as part of a hunter-killer group, consisting of a flotilla of destroyers and other anti-submarine vessels grouped around an aircraft carrier; either HMS Courageous 50 HMS Courageous, HMS Hermes 95 HMS Hermes or Ark Royal. Carrier-borne aircraft could increase the area searched for U-boats, but made the carriers into tempting targets.
On 14 September, Ark Royal received a distress call from SS Fanad Head SS Fanad Head, which was convert 200 nmi km away under pursuit from the surfaced U-30. Ark Royal launched aircraft to aid the merchant ship, but was spotted by Unterseeboot 39 1938 U-39, which launched two torpedoes. Lookouts spotted the torpedo tracks and Ark Royal turned towards the attack, reducing her cross-section and causing the torpedoes to miss and explode harmlessly astern. Three E and F class destroyer F class destroyers escorting the carrier began to depth charge U-39, and forced her to the surface.cite book  last=Edwards  title=Dnitz and the wolf packs  pages=87 The German crew abandoned ship before U-39 sankthe first U-boat lost in World War II. Ark Royal's aircraft reached Fanad Head, which was in the hands of a German boarding party. The Skuas unsuccessfully attacked U-30: two crashed when caught by the blast of their own bombs. The U-boat escaped after rescuing the boarding party and the pilots of the downed aircraft both observers had drowned, and torpedoing the Fanad Head.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=758
Ark Royal returned to base in Loch Ewe, where she and her crew were inspected by Winston Churchill. The sinking of U-39 was hailed as important to morale. However, the failed attack on Ark Royal, and the successful attack on HMS Courageous 50 HMS Courageous on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred hunter-killer groups were abandoned.
Another near miss
On 25 September 1939 Ark Royal helped rescue the submarine HMS Spearfish 69S HMS Spearfish, which had been damaged by German warships off Horn Reefs, in the Kattegat.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=81 While returning to port with Spearfish and the battleships HMS Nelson 28 HMS Nelson and HMS Rodney 29 HMS Rodney on 26 September, the ships were located by three Luftwaffe Dornier Do 18 Dornier seaplanes. Ark Royal launched three Blackburn Skuas to disperse them; one Dornier was shot down in the first British aerial kill of the war.cite book  last=Westwood  title=Fighting Ships of World War II  pages=66
The air commander aboard Ark Royal, aware that the surviving Dorniers would report the location of the British ships, ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti-aircraft weapons readied.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=82 Four Junkers Ju 88 Ju 88 bomberscite book  last=Bekker  title=The Luftwaffe War Diaries  pages=7576 soon appeared: three were driven away by anti-aircraft fire, but the fourth launched a convert 1000 kg lb adj=on bomb at the carrier. Ark Royal turned hard to starboard, heeling over and avoiding the bomb, which landed in the ocean convert 30 m ft off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over the ship. The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit, and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships, but not Ark Royal. Based on this information, the Germans incorrectly claimed that Ark Royal had sunk.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=845 To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain's allies, Winston Churchill personally reassured United States President Franklin Roosevelt that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attach to view Ark Royal in dock. The British naval attach in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in service.  This proved to be a considerable embarrassment for Goebbels and Nazi propaganda.cite book  last=Balfour  title=Propaganda in War 1939-1945  pages=1589
Hunting the Graf Spee
In October 1939 Ark Royal was redeployed to Freetown to operate off the African coast in the hunt for the German commerce raider German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee Graf Spee. The carrier was assigned to Force K, and sailed with the battlecruiser HMS Renown 1916 HMS Renown to the South Atlantic. On 9 October, aircraft from Ark Royal spotted the German tanker Altmark German tanker Altmark, which supplied Graf Spee. The tanker was disguised as the US vessel Delmar, which fooled the British into passing her by.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=889 On 5 November, Ark Royal captured the German merchant SS Uhenfels SS Uhenfels, which was attempting to reach Germany. The ship was later taken into British service as a cargo shipcite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=53 and renamed Empire Ability.cite book  last=Mitchell  title=The Empire Ships  pages=431 Several neutral merchant ships were also spotted by the carrier's aircraft, twice causing crews to believe they were under attack and abandon ship.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=42 A note explaining the situation was dropped in a bag to a Norwegian vessel's crew, and they re-boarded; an attempt to repeat this exercise with a Belgian crew failed when the bag was dropped down the ship's funnel.
By this time, Graf Spee had put into Montevideo to repair damage received during the battle of the River Plate. Two British cruisers followed the raider, and patrolled the harbour entrance while reporting Graf Spee's position to the fleet. Ark Royal and Renown were dispatched to join the British ships outside the harbour, but as they were 36&nbsp;hours away, the British naval attach came up with a plan to make the Germans believe that the two capital ships had already arrived. An order for fuel for Ark Royal was placed at Buenos Aires, convert 140 mi km west of Montevideo. This was leaked to the press, passed on to the German embassy in Montevideo, and given to Graf Spee's captain, Hans Langsdorff.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=946 This contributed to Langsdorff's decision to scuttle his ship.
Return to the fleet
With the Graf Spee sunk, Ark Royal remained in the Atlantic for a short time before escorting the damaged HMS Exeter 68 HMS Exeter back to HMNB Devonport Devonport Dockyard, where they arrived in February. Following this, Ark Royal proceeded to Portsmouth to take on supplies and personnel, before sailing to Scapa Flow. On arrival, she transferred her Blackburn Skuas to RNAS Hatston Naval Air Station Hatston to strengthen the anchorage's defences.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=99 Ark Royal was then assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet United Kingdom Mediterranean Fleet for exercises, departing Scapa Flow on 31 March 1940 and heading for Alexandria with the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious 77 HMS Glorious. The carriers arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean on 8 April, but the exercises were cancelled a day later. The ships sailed to Gibraltar to await orders.
German forces had invaded Norway as part of Operation Weserbung on 7 April, and had secured sections of the coast. Attempts by the Royal Navy to operate in support of British troops were unsuccessful; air attacks had overwhelmed the ships, sinking HMS Gurkha F20 HMS Gurkha and nearly sinking HMS Suffolk 55 HMS Suffolk. Realising that the British ships required air cover, but aware that the Norwegian coast was outside the range of land-based aircraft in the United Kingdom, the Admiralty recalled Ark Royal and Glorious from the Mediterranean on 16 April.
Norwegian campaign
Ark Royal and Glorious arrived at Scapa Flow on 23 April 1940 and were immediately redeployed as part of Operation&nbsp;DX. Sailing to Norway with the cruisers HMS Curlew D42 Curlew and HMS Berwick 65 Berwick and screened by the destroyers HMS Hyperion H97 Hyperion, HMS Hereward H93 Hereward, HMS Hasty H24 Hasty, HMS Fearless H67 Fearless, HMS Fury H76 Fury and HMS Juno F46 Juno, this was the first time the Royal Navy had deployed carriers with the primary purpose of providing fighter protection for other warships. The ships took up position on 25 April off the coast; Ark Royal positioned convert 120 nmi km offshore to reduce the chance of air attacks. The carrier's aircraft conducted anti-submarine patrols, provided fighter support for other ships, and carried out strikes against shipping and shore targets. Ark Royal returned to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and replace lost and damaged aircraft, before heading back on the same day with the battleship HMS Valiant 1914 HMS Valiant as escort. During the return, Ark Royal came under air attack from German Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft operating from Norway. The carrier was undamaged, and resumed position on 29 April.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=97

By this point, the British high command had realised that they could not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and ndalsnes began, with Ark Royal providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. Ark Royal's fighters and a heavy anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=117 On return to Norway, Ark Royal was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=119 She was joined on 18 May by the carriers HMS Glorious 77 Glorious and HMS Furious 47 Furious.
Despite these efforts, it was clear by the end of May that French forces were on the verge of collapse and Norway was a sideshow compared to the German advance to the English Channel. Operation Alphabet was instigated to move Allied troops from Narvik and Britain. Ark Royal and Glorious, screened by the destroyers HMS Highlander H44 Highlander, HMS Diana H49 Diana, HMS Acasta H09 Acasta, HMS Ardent H41 Ardent, and HMS Acheron H45 Acheron, sailed from Scapa Flow on 1 June to cover the evacuation, which commenced the next day. Ark Royal carried out air patrols and bombing raids from 3 June to 6 June, before redeploying to Narvik on 7 June. Disaster struck the next day, when Glorious, escorted by Acasta and Ardent, were detached to return to the UK. The three ships were attacked and sunk by the German battleships German battleship Scharnhorst Scharnhorst and German battleship Gneisenau Gneisenau. A search by Ark Royal's aircraft failed to locate the German ships, which had returned to Trondheim.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=1201
The last evacuation convoy left Narvik on 9 June. Before the British ships could withdraw, a raid on Trondheim located Scharnhorst. An attack by Ark Royal's Skuas took place at midnight on 13 June.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=137 The attack was a disaster: the escort destroyers HMS Antelope H36 Antelope and HMS Electra H27 Electra collided while Ark Royal was launching aircraft in fog and returned to England for repairs, eight of the fifteen attacking Skuas were shot down, while Scharnhorst escaped damage.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=1401 Ark Royal returned to Scapa Flow the following day, and was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet United Kingdom Mediterranean Fleet.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=128
Mediterranean deployment
Ark Royal left Scapa Flow with HMS Hood 51 HMS Hood and three destroyers, arriving at Gibraltar on 23 June 1940. Here she joined Force H, under James Fownes Somerville Sir James Somerville. After the Battle of France capitulation of France there was concern that a French fleet at Mers-el-Kbir might fall under Axis control and tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean, affecting the whole war.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=154 Ark Royal's captain, Cedric Holland, had been the British naval attach in Paris, and was sent to negotiate the surrender or scuttling of the French fleet.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=132 Force H was deployed outside the harbour, and when the French admirals refused to agree to the offered terms, opened fire on the French ships. During the attack on Mers-el-Kbir, Ark Royal's aircraft provided targeting information for the British ships.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=136 The French battleship Strasbourg French battleship Strasbourg escaped, despite attacks by Swordfish from Ark Royal.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=138 Two days after the attack, aircraft from Ark Royal incapacitated the French battleship Dunkerque French battleship Dunkerque, which had been beached in the initial attack.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=170

Having reduced the possibility of a French challenge in the Mediterranean, Force H prepared for attacks on Italian targets, and sailed from Gibraltar on 8 July.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=179 The force was attacked by Italian bombers within eight hours of departing, and although Force H escaped damage, Somerville cancelled the raids and ordered the fleet to Gibraltar.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=180 During July, the British colony of Malta came under attack from the Italian air force, with Force H ordered to deliver Hawker Hurricanes to reinforce the island's air defences. Force H was deployed from 31 July to 4 August, with the carrier HMS Argus I49 HMS Argus used to deliver the aircraft, while Ark Royal provided air cover for the fleet. On 2 August, Ark Royal launched a successful air attack against the Italian air base at Cagliari.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=1857
Force H remained at Gibraltar until 30 September, when it escorted reinforcements for Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope Admiral Andrew Cunningham's fleet to Alexandria.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=1923 En-route, diversionary attacks were planned on Italian air bases at Elmas and Cagliari to direct attention from both the reinforcement operation and a supply Malta Convoy convoy sailing to Malta. The attacks were successfully carried out on 1 October, and the fleet reached Alexandria without significant attention from the Italian air force.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=190 From Alexandria, Ark Royal was detached and sent to West Africa to support British attempts to encourage Vichy French colonies to switch alleigance to the Free French. During negotiations, several Free French aircraft flew from Ark Royal, but their aircrews were arrested at Dakar. Negotiations failed, and bombers from Ark Royal were directed against military installations during the unsuccessful British attempt to battle of Dakar take Dakar by force.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=2125 Following this, Ark Royal returned to the United Kingdom for refit, docking in Liverpool on 8 October after being escorted by HMS Fortune H70 HMS Fortune, HMS Forester H74 HMS Forester and HMS Greyhound H05 HMS Greyhound.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=2225 The refit, which lasted until 3 November, included repairs to her machinery and the installation of a new flight deck barrier.

Following refit, Ark Royal, accompanied by HM Ships HMS Barham 04 Barham, HMS Berwick 65 Berwick, and HMS Glasgow C21 Glasgow, sailed for Gibraltar, arriving on 6 November.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=192 They were deployed with the rest of Force H to escort convoys from Gibraltar to Alexandria and Malta, performing several runs before being assigned to Operation Collar, one of 35&nbsp;Malta Convoys convoys to support Malta between 1940 and 1942, on 25 November. An Italian fleet, led by the battleships Italian battleship Giulio Cesare Giulio Cesare and Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto Vittorio Veneto, was dispatched to intercept the convoy.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=230 The Italian fleet was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft from Ark Royal and the carrier launched Swordfish torpedo bombers while the capital ships of Force H turned to meet the enemy.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=23658 During the engagement, the Battle of Cape Spartivento, the Italian destroyer Italian destroyer Lanciere Lanciere was damaged, although it is uncertain if torpedoes from the bombers or British gunfire were responsible. The British mistook Lanciere for a cruiser, while the Italian commanders received incorrect reports that the cruiser Italian cruiser Bolzano Bolzano had been hit.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=239 British attacks failed to damage any other Italian ships or sink the disabled destroyer, and a retaliatory attack by the Italian air force saw Ark Royal as the subject of multiple bombing runs, none of which hit. The battle had no clear result, although the British convoy reached its destination unscathed.
On 14 December 1940 Ark Royal and Force H were redeployed from Gibraltar to the Atlantic to search the Azores for commerce raiders. Ark Royal returned to the Mediterranean on 20 December, and escorted the battleship HMS Malaya 1915 HMS Malaya and merchant ships from Malta until 27 December.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=210 Force H then became involved in Operation Excess, a plan to move convoys through the Mediterranean to support the Western Desert Force, which was trying to push Italian land forces from Egypt into Libya. Over the next month, British control of the Mediterranean theatre was weakened, particularly by the entry of the Luftwaffe and the near-loss of the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious 87 HMS Illustrious.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=2189 The Mediterranean Fleet United Kingdom Mediterranean Fleet was under pressure from Axis forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, while the British port at Gibraltar was likely to be lost if the Spanish chose to ally with the Germans instead of remaining non-belligerent out of the war. To relieve the Mediterranean Fleet, while demonstrating British strength to the Spanish, the Admiralty and Admiral Cunningham planned to use Ark Royal's Swordfish bombers in raids against Italian targets, supported by bombardment from heavy fleet units. The first bombing, on 2 January against the Tirso Dam in Sardinia, was unsuccessful,cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=2226 but Ark Royal's Swordfish bombers were more successful on 6 January, when they bombed the port city of Genoa. The carrier's aircraft also covered the battleships HMS Renown and HMS Malaya while they shelled the port. On 9 January, Ark Royal launched aircraft to bomb an oil refinery at La Spezia, and to lay mines in the harbour. Both operations were successful.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=22830
Searching for Scharnhorst and Gneisenau
In early February 1941 the battleship German battleship Scharnhorst 1936 Scharnhorst and German battleship Gneisenau 1936 Gneisenau headed into the Atlantic on the orders of Erich Raeder Admiral Erich Raeder. They were to disrupt Allied shipping and draw capital ships from other areas. On 8 March, Force H and Ark Royal were ordered to the Canary Islands to search for the battleships, and to cover convoys crossing from the United States.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=25960 Ark Royal used her aircraft to search for captured ships returning to Germany under the control of prize crews. Three ships were located on 19 March: two scuttled themselves, while the third, SS Polykarp, was recaptured.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=260
On the evening of 21 March 1941 a Fairey Fulmar from Ark Royal stumbled across Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at sea. Because of a radio malfunction, the crew had to return to Ark Royal to report, by which time the German ships had escaped under fog.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=2602 The next day, Ark Royal re-established air patrols in the hope of re-locating the raiders. During the day, a catapult malfunction destroyed a Fairey Swordfish; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier. Unable to stop, Ark Royal ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft's depth charges detonated.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=242 Scharnhorst and Gneisenau reached Brest, France Brest without British harassment, while Ark Royal returned to Gibraltar for repairs, arriving on 24 March.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=243
Malta convoys and Operation Tiger

Ark Royal spent April alternating between covering convoys and delivering aircraft to Malta and forays into the Atlantic to hunt commerce raiders. By May 1941, Erwin Rommel Rommel's Afrika Korps were driving through North Africa towards the Suez Canal, pushing the Western Desert Force before them. With British forces close to collapse and strategic locations threatened, the British High Command risked sending a reinforcement convoy across the Mediterranean to Alexandria. The convoy consisted of five large transport ships, escorted by Ark Royal, the battleships HMS Renown and HMS Queen Elizabeth 1913 HMS Queen Elizabeth, the cruisers HMS Sheffield C24 HMS Sheffield, HMS Naiad 93 HMS Naiad, HMS Fiji 58 HMS Fiji, and HMS Gloucester 62 HMS Gloucester, and screened by destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=2689 Prior to Ark Royal's departure, Captain Holland left to recuperate from stress and poor health, and was replaced by Captain Loben Edward Harold Maund Loben Maund.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=266 The convoy left Gibraltar on 6 May, and was detected by Italian aircraft. The convoy, limited to convert 14 kn km/h and escorted by so many capital ships, was such a tempting target that Italian and German aircraft were mobilised.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=269
The British convoy came under air attack on 8 May, first by the Italian air force, then German Luftwaffe. Over the day, twelve of Ark Royal's Fairey Fulmars the maximum number available drove off over fifty aircraft, with the assistance of targeting information from HMS Sheffield's radar and anti-aircraft fire from the escorts.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=2714cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=258 During the initial waves, one Fulmar was lost, killing Flight Lieutenant Rupert Tillard and Lieutenant Mark Somerville, Admiral Somerville's nephew; another was destroyed with the aircrew recovered, while several others were damaged. Consequently, only seven were able to face the main Luftwaffe force of thirty-four aircraft, while an attack just before dark was driven off by two aircraft and heavy fire from the ships.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=249 The convoy survived without serious damage: the only casualties were to mines, with the Empire Song sunk and the New Zealand Star damaged but able to reach port.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=274
Ark Royal underwent another aerial attack on 12 May, during her return to Gibraltar. Later that month, she and fellow aircraft carrier HMS Furious 47 HMS Furious delivered Hawker Hurricanes to support Malta.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=2767
Hunting the Bismarck
see also Last battle of the battleship Bismarck
On 18 May 1941 the German battleship Bismarck German battleship Bismarck and the German cruiser Prinz Eugen cruiser Prinz Eugen began Operation Rheinbung by breaking into the Atlantic to raid shipping. After sinking HMS Hood 51 HMS Hood and damaging HMS Prince of Wales 53 HMS Prince of Wales during the Battle of the Denmark Strait, Bismarck shook off her pursuers and headed for the French Atlantic coast.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=27990 Ark Royal, Renown, and Sheffield, accompanied by HM Ships HMS Faulknor H62 Faulknor, HMS Foresight H68 Foresight, HMS Forester H74 Forester, HMS Fortune H70 Fortune, HMS Foxhound H69 Foxhound, and HMS Fury H76 HMS Fury, were dispatched to the Atlantic on 23 May to search for the battleship.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=294 On 26 May, a Fairey Swordfish from Ark Royal located Bismarck and began to shadow her, while the Home Fleet was mobilised to pursue.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=296
File:HMS Ark Royal swordfish.jpg thumb left One of Ark Royal's Fairey Swordfish returns at low level over the sea after making a torpedo attack on the Bismarck.
At the time of detection, the British ships were convert 130 nmi km away and would not catch Bismarck before the battleship reached Saint-Nazaire. Fifteen Swordfish bombers were armed with torpedoes and sent to delay the ship. HMS Sheffield was also shadowing Bismarck, and was between Ark Royal and Bismarck. The aircraft falsely identified the British cruiser as their target and fired torpedoes. The torpedoes were fitted with unreliable magnetic detonators, which caused most to explode on contact with the water, while Sheffield evaded the rest.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=299300 After realising his mistake, one of the pilots signalled 'Sorry for the kipper' to Sheffield.
On return to the carrier, the Swordfishes were re-armed with contact-detonator warheads, and launched at 19.15&nbsp;hours for a second attack; locating and attacking Bismarck just before sunset. Three torpedoes hit the battleship: two impacted forward of the engine rooms, while the third struck the port steering room and jammed her rudder in a 15 port turn.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=3035 Bismarck was forced to sail in circles until the disabled rudder was reset to neutral, at which point she was sailing towards the British warships with almost no manoeuvring capability. The German battleship suffered heavy attack during the night of 2627 May, and sank at 10:39&nbsp;hours on 27 May.
Escorting the Malta convoys
File:HMS Ark Royal planes.jpg thumb right Six Blackburn Skuas of 800 Naval Air Squadron No. 800 Squadron Fleet Air Arm lined up on deck before taking off
Ark Royal and the ships of Force H returned to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from the sinking of the battleship Bismarck, the Mediterranean theatre of World War II war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east since the Battle of Crete fall of Crete.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=3167
Ark Royal was pressed into service, delivering aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=318 The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing as much as a third of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=327 Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, against the advice of Admiral Raeder.
Final voyage and sinking
On 10 November 1941, Ark Royal ferried more aircraft to Malta before returning to Gibraltar. Admiral Somerville had been warned of U-boats off the Spanish coast, and reminded Force H to be vigilant.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=337 Also at sea was Friedrich Guggenberger's Unterseeboot 81 1941 U-81, which had received a report that Force H was returning to Gibraltar. On 13 November, at 15:40&nbsp;hours, the sonar operator aboard the destroyer HMS Legion G74 HMS Legion detected an unidentified sound, but assumed it was the propellers of a nearby destroyer. One minute later, Ark Royal was struck amidships by a torpedo,cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=329 between the fuel bunkers and bomb store, and directly below the bridge island. The explosion caused Ark Royal to shake, hurled loaded torpedo-bombers into the air, and killed Able Seaman Mitchell.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=332 A convert 130 ft m long by convert 30 ft m deep hole was created on the starboard side, which caused flooding of the starboard boiler room, main Telephone switchboard switchboard, oil tanks, and over convert 106 ft m of the ship's starboard bilge. The starboard power train was knocked out, causing the rear half of the ship to lose power, while communications were severed shipwide.
File:HMS Ark Royal sinking.jpg thumb left HMS Legion G74 HMS Legion moving alongside the damaged and listing HMS Ark Royal to take off survivors
Immediately after the torpedo strike, Captain Maund attempted to order the engines to full stop, but had to send a runner to the engine room when it was discovered communications were down.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=338 The hole in the hull was enlarged by the ship's motion, and by the time Ark Royal stopped she had taken on water and begun to Glossary of nautical terms#L list to starboard, reaching 18 from centre within 20&nbsp;minutes. Considering the list of the carrier, as well as the fates of other carriers, including HMS Courageous 50 HMS Courageous and HMS Glorious 77 HMS Glorious, which had sunk rapidly with heavy loss of life, Maund gave the order to abandon ship. The crew were assembled on the flight deck to determine who would remain onboard to save the ship while HMS Legion came alongside to take off the rest; as a result, comprehensive damage control damage control measures were not initiated until 49&nbsp;minutes after the attack. The flooding spread unchecked, exacerbated by covers and hatches left open during evacuation of lower decks.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=33840
Water spread to the centreline boiler room, which started to flood from below, and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked; Ark Royal had no backup diesel generators.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=345 About half an hour after the explosion, the carrier appeared to stabilise. Admiral Somerville, determined to save Ark Royal, ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship HMS Malaya 1915 HMS Malaya to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts. The damage control parties were able to re-light a boiler, restoring power to the bilge pumps. The destroyer HMS Laforey G99 HMS Laforey came alongside to provide power and additional pumps, while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar arrived to supplement anti-submarine patrols.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=342 The tug Thames tug Thames arrived from Gibraltar at 20:00&nbsp;hours and attached a tow line to Ark Royal, but flooding caused the angle of list to increase rapidly. Water had reached the boiler room flat, an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship, which forced the shutdown of the restored boiler.
File:HMS Ark Royal sinking 2.jpg thumb right Another photograph showing the degree of the list
The list reached 20 between nowrap 02:05 and 02:30 hours, and when 'abandon ship' was declared again at 04:00&nbsp;hours, had reached 27.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=346 Ark Royals complement had been evacuated to Legion by 04:30&nbsp;hours; with the exception of Mitchell, there were no fatalities. The 1,487 officers and crew were transported to Gibraltar.cite book  last=Duffy  title=Target America  pages=136 The list reached 45 before Ark Royal capsized and sank at 06:19&nbsp;hours on 14 November.cite book  last=Jameson  title=Ark Royal  pages=348 Witnesses reported the carrier rolling to 90, where she remained for three minutes before inverting. Ark Royal broke in two, the aft sinking within a couple of minutes, followed by the bow.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=3756
Investigation
Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was established to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Maund was court-martialled for negligence in February 1942. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=3723 The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, and that he was primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.
The Bucknill Committee, which had been set up to investigate the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam generators were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious class aircraft carrier Illustrious and Implacable class aircraft carrier Implacable class carriers, under construction at the time.Papers of Admiral Sir Hugh Binney, reports of Second Bucknill Committee relating to loss of HMS PRINCE OF WALES and HMS ARK ROYAL, 1941-1942, held at Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, King's College Londoncite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=374
The Board of Inquiry closed its report with the observation that Ark Royal had sunk convert 22 nmi km east of Europa Point, the southernmost tip of Gibraltar. This was accepted as the wreck location for sixty years.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=30
Rediscovery
The exact location of the wreck remained unknown until mid-December 2002, when it was discovered by a BBC film crew convert 30 nmi km from Gibraltar.cite news  url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2585887.stm  title=Film team finds wreck of Ark Royal  work=BBC News   date=19 December 2002 The crew had been working on a documentary on maritime archaeology related to major battles of the Royal Navy. Ark Royal lay in two sections: convert 20 m ft of the bow had separated from the rest of the ship. A large debris field, which included the remains of the funnel and bridge island, parts of the ship that came loose as the carrier sank, and aircraft from the hangars, was located between the two hull sections. Analysis revealed that the port side of the ship hit the seabed first.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=3689
The wreck was found further east than was claimed after the sinking. Initially, researchers thought the wreck had been caught in Ocean current currents through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean as she sank, causing the ship to drift eastwards underwater before settling.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=1689 The presence of other debris in proximity to the wreck, including a Swordfish bomber that was tipped off the flight deck before the ship rolled, proved this false, as the debris would have been spread over a much wider area. The currents did impact on her progress towards Gibraltar, despite being under tow for several hours.cite book  last=Rossiter  title=Ark Royal  pages=377 Study of the wreck also showed that attempting to restart the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was lost, it was impossible to prevent the carrier from sinkingher fate was more due to design flaws than the actions of her captain.
Notes
a. Note_label A a none The Washington Naval Treaty signed in February 1922 imposed a limit of 135,000&nbsp;tons on total British aircraft carrier tonnage, with no one ship allowed to exceed 33,000&nbsp;tons, and only two to exceed 27,000&nbsp;tons.cite book  title=Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States  pages=247266 The London Naval Treaty signed in April 1930 prevented signatories from constructing new capital ships, or converting existing capital ships into aircraft carriers, until 1937.Reproduced in cite book  last=Goldman  title=Sunken treaties  pages=307319
