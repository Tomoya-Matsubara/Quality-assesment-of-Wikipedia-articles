SM U-29 or U-XXIX was a U-27 class submarine Austria-Hungary U-27 class U-boat or submarine for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. U-29, built by the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius at Fiume, was launch ship launched in October 1916 and commission ship commissioned in January 1917.
U-29 had a single submarine hull hull and was just over convert 121 ft m in length. She displacement ship displaced nearly convert 265 MT LT 0 when surfaced and over convert 300 MT LT 0 when submerged. Her two diesel engines moved her at up to convert 9 knots km/h on the surface, while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to convert 7.5 knots km/h while underwater. She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a convert 75 mm in 1 adj=on abbr=on deck gun and a machine gun.
During her service career, U-29 sank three ships and damaged two others, sending a combined tonnage of GRT 9,838 first=short to the bottom. U-29 was at Fiume at war's end and was surrendered at Venice in March 1919. She was granted to France as war reparation in 1920, but foundered while under tow to Bizerta for scrapping.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 38889.
 Design and construction 
Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I.Gardiner, p. 341. The Austro-Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five German Type UB I submarine Type UB I submarines that comprised the sclass U-10 submarine 4 from Germany,Gardiner, p. 343. by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine French submarine Curie Q 87 Curie as SMS U-14 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y,French submarine Curie Q 87 Curie had been caught in an anti-submarine net while trying to enter the harbor at Pula Pola on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343. and by building four submarines of the sclass U-20 submarine 4 that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class submarine 1911 Havmanden class.Gardiner, p. 344.The plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarine 1911 Havmanden class submarines, three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354.
After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II submarine German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.Halpern, p. 383. The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here reprinted and translated into English by Sieche. Retrieved 1 December 2008.
U-29 displaced convert 264 MT LT surfaced and convert 301 MT LT submerged. She had a single submarine hull hull with saddle tanks,Gardiner, p. 181. and was convert 121 ft 1 in m long with a beam nautical beam of convert 14 ft 4 in m and a draft hull draft of convert 12 ft 2 in m. For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin diesel engines of convert 270 bhp abbr=on for surface running, and twin electric motors of convert 280 shp abbr=on for submerged travel. She was capable of convert 9 knots km/h 1 while surfaced and convert 7.5 knots km/h while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for U-29 in Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 19061921, the German UB II boats, upon which the U-27 class was based, had a range of over convert 6000 nmi km at convert 5 knots km/h surfaced, and convert 45 nmi km at convert 4 knots km/h submerged. U-27-class boats were designed for a crew of 2324.
U-29 was armed with two convert 45 cm in 1 abbr=on bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 75mm/26 3.0in deck gun and an convert 8 mm in abbr=on machine gun.
After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms, U-27 was ordered from Ganz Danubius on 12 October 1915. She was keel laying laid down on 3 March 1916 at Fiume and launch ship launched on 21 October.
 Service career 
U-29 underwent diving trials at Fiume and then made her way to Pula Pola on 29 November 1916. There, on 21 January 1917, SM U-29 was commission ship commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy under the command of Linenschiffleutnant Leo Prsil. Prsil, a 29-year-old native of Pola, had previously served as commander of SMS U-10 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y.sil cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = WWI U-boat commanders: Leo Prsil   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/529.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009 
U-29 departed on her first patrol on 23 January, destined for duty in the Mediterranean. The next day , however, the U-boat encountered a severe storm near Lussin that damaged her. Prsil steered the boat into the harbor at Brgulje to wait out the storm. Departing Brgulje on the 25th to resume her journey to the Mediterranean, the submarine developed a leak when performing a test dive. U-29 headed back to Pola for repairs, which lasted until 30 January. On 5 February the U-boat set out for Cattaro, which she reached after three days journey.
Prsil took U-29 out of Cattaro on 17 February to begin the delayed patrol in the Mediterranean, but on the 20th encountered another severe storm. Suffering no damage in the tempest, the boat continued on. On 24 February, she had an at-sea rendezvous with SMS U-43 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y. On 1 March the U-boat's gyrocompass broke down, necessitating a return to port. Two days later, as she neared Cattaro, U-29 encountered yet another storm, this one again damaging the ship. The beleaguered U-boat headed back to the base at Pola for more repairs, and remained there until early April.
On 4 April, U-29 set out from Pola, touched at Cattaro, and continued on into the Mediterranean for her second patrol there. While convert 25 nmi km from Cape Matapan, Prsil torpedoed and sank the steamer Dalton, traveling in ballast. U-29 took the captain nautical master of the the 3,486-ton British ship captive; three other men lost their lives in the attack.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Dalton   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/1554.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009  Five days later and some convert 115 nmi km away, U-29 torpedoed SS Mashobra  2, a British India Line ocean liner passenger steamer of GRT 8,173 first=yes. The ship, en route from Calcutta to London with a general cargo, was finished off by U-29's deck gun. As with Dalton, Mashobra's master was taken prisoner. Eight persons died in the attack.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Mashobra   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4022.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009  U-29's gyrocompass broke down again on 17 April, once again forcing the boat to return for repairs. U-29's second Mediterranean tour ended when Prsil docked the boat at Cattaro on 19 April.
U-29's third Mediterranean deployment began on 8 May when she departed Cattaro. After eleven days at sea, Prsil torpedoed the British cargo ship Mordenwood convert 90 nmi km from Cape Matapan.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Mordenwood   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4245.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009  U-29 took the 3,125-ton ship's master captive.Tennent, p. 51. Two sources disagree on the number of casualties when Mordenwood went down, but place the number at either 21 or 31.Tennent p. 51 reports 31 were killed; Helgason reports 21 killed. Escorting destroyers launched a depth charge attack on U-29 but did not succeed in damaging the U-boat. Two days later, U-29 launched a torpedo attack on the British steamer Marie Suzanne but did not sink the ship. U-29 arrived at Cattaro on 25 May.
After a brief time in port, U-29 set out for the Mediterranean again on 17 June. One day out, the U-boat came under attack from an airplane out of Valona, compelling U-29 to crash dive; none of the three bombs dropped by the aircraft hit their mark. U-29's patrol ended without success when she docked at Cattaro on 6 July. After a return to Pola on 12 July, the U-boat underwent extensive repairs that kept her out of action for the next nine months.
File:HMS Edgar.jpg thumb left HMS Edgar 1890 6 was torpedoed by U-29 on 4 April 1918 but survived the attack. Edgar was the only warship topedoed by U-29
On 16 March 1918, the newly refitted boat sailed from Pola to Cattaro, departing that port for another Mediterranean tour on 25 March. Near Valona the next day, an Italian destroyer attempted to ram U-29, scraping one of her propellers against U-29's conning tower. The damage done was slight and U-29 continued on into the Mediterranean, weathering a storm in the Ionian Sea on the 27th. On 4 April, U-29 launched a torpedo attack on what was thought to be a cargo ship. In fact, it was the British protected cruiser HMS Edgar 1890 2 which had been hit. Edgar was damaged but did not sink; she suffered no casualties in the attack.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = Ships hit during WWI: Edgar HMS   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/7426.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   publisher = Uboat.net   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009  The following day Prsil attempted to torpedo a ship in a convoy but missed and was exposed to a depth charge attack by the convoy's escorts. The U-boat ended the patrol with no further successes.
In June, the Austro-Hungarian Navy planned an assault on the Otranto Barrage, similar to a May 1917 action that evolved into the Battle of Otranto Straits 1917 Battle of Otranto Straits.Halpern, pp. 17475. U-29 was deployed from Cattaro on 9 June in advance of the attack. One of the seven separate groups participating in the attack, the two dreadnoughts SMS Tegetthoff  2 and SMS Szent Istvn  2, came under attack from Italian MAS ships MAS torpedo boats in the early morning hours of 10 June. Szent Istvn was hit and sank just after 06:00, and the entire operation was called off.Halpern, pp. 17475. U-29 returned to Cattaro on 12 June. Over the next two months, U-29 operated in the Adriatic out of Cattaaro, patrolling off Durazzo and the Albanian coast.
While at Cattaro, command of U-29 passed to Linenschiffleutnant Friedrich Sterz on 4 September. The 27-year-old native of Pergine Valsugana Pergine, History of Tyrol Tyrolia in present-day Italy, had previously commanded SMS U-22 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y and, like Prsil, had also served a stint as commander of U-10.cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = WWI U-boat commanders: Friedrich Sterz   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/538.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009  After assuming command of U-29, Sterz set sail for Durazzo the same day. The U-boat had encounters with MAS torpedo boats on 9 and 12 September. On the latter date, U-29 had to crash dive to avoid a bombing attack from Allies of World War I Allied airplanes. None of the seven bombs hit their mark and U-29 returned to Cattaro on 16 September.
Linenschiffleutnant Robert Drrial replaced Sterz as commander on 29 September. The Galician Drrial, like both Stertz and Prsil, had served as the commander of U-10, but had most recently commanded SMS U-21 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y.rrial cite web   last = Helgason   first = Gumundur   title = WWI U-boat commanders: Robert Drrial   url = http://uboat.net/wwi/men/commanders/538.html   work = U-Boat War in World War I   date =    accessdaymonth = 22 January   accessyear = 2009  A day after assuming command, Drrial headed for the Albanian coast in U-29 and patrolled off Durazzo.
After the Armistice with Bulgaria World War I Armistice with Bulgaria on 29 September ended Bulgaria's participation in the war, Durazzo gained importance to the remaining Central Powers as the main port for supplying their forces fighting in the Balkans. Anticipating this, the Allies put together a force to bombard Durazzo. While the second echelon of the attacking force got into position to bombard the town, U-29 and sister boat SMS U-31 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y maneuvered to attack. While U-31 was able to hit and damage the British cruiser HMS Weymouth 1910 2, U-29 was blocked by screening ships and herself attacked. The Allied escorts subjected U-29 to a heavy depth charge attack.Halpern, pp. 17576. U-29 was able to make her way back to Cattaro on 8 October.
Over the next three weeks, U-29 patrolled between Cattaro and Antivari, Montenegro. After her arrival back at Cattaro on 1 November, U-29 was moored between the coastal defence ship coastal battleship SMS Monarch  2 and SMS U-14 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y. There she remained until she was awarded to France as a war reparation in 1920. U-29 was towed, along with sister boats U-31 and SMS U-41 Austria-Hungary 2 sub=y, from Cattaro for Bizerta for scrapping, but foundered on the way.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 38889. In total, U-29 sank three ships with a combined tonnage of 14,784, and damaged one warship.
