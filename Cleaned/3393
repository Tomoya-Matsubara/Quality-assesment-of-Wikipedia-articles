 Brazil is the world's second largest producer of ethanol and the world's largest exporter. Together, Brazil and the United States lead the industrial world in global ethanol production, accounting together for 70% of the world's production;1 and nearly 90% of ethanol used for fuel. 2 In 2006 Brazil produced 16.3 billion litres (4.3 billion U.S. liquid gallons),3 which represents 33.3% of the world's total ethanol production and 42% of the world's ethanol used as fuel.4
Brazil is considered to have the world's first sustainable biofuels economy and the biofuel industry leader,5678 a policy model for other countries; and its sugarcane ethanol &quot;the most successful alternative fuel to date.&quot;9 However, some authors consider that the successful Brazilian ethanol model is sustainable only in Brazil due to its advanced agri-industrial technology and its enormous amount of arable land available;10 while for other authors it is a solution only for some countries in the tropical zone of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa.11 Brazil&lt;U+2019&gt;s 30-year-old ethanol fuel program is based on the most efficient agricultural technology for sugarcane cultivation in the world,12 uses modern equipment and cheap sugar cane as feedstock, the residual cane-waste (bagasse) is used to process heat and power, which results in a very competitive price and also in a high energy balance (output energy/input energy), which varies from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production.1314 
There are no longer any light vehicles in Brazil running on pure gasoline. Since 1976 the government made it mandatory to blend anhydrous ethanol with gasoline, fluctuating between 10% to 22%.15 and requiring just a minor adjustment on regular gasoline motors. In 1993 the mandatory blend was fixed by law at 22% anhydrous ethanol (E22) by volume in the entire country, but with leeway to the Executive to set different percentages of ethanol within pre-established boundaries. In 2003 these limits were set at a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 25%.16 Since July 1st, 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of anhydrous ethanol and 75% gasoline or E25 blend.17
The Brazilian car manufacturing industry developed flexible-fuel vehicles that can run on any proportion of gasoline (E20-E25 blend) and hydrous ethanol (E100).18 Introduced in the market in 2003, flex vehicles became a commercial success,19 and by December 2008, the fleet of &quot;flex&quot; cars and light commercial vehicles reached 6.8 million vehicles,2021 which represents around 23% of Brazil's motor vehicle fleet.22 Availability of ethanol fuel was achieved through government mandates, allowing Brazil in 2008 to have around 35,000 filling stations throughout the country with at least one ethanol pump.2324 The success of &quot;flex&quot; vehicles, together with the mandatory E25 blend throughout the country, have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by February 2008.2526 Considering diesel-powered vehicles, sugarcane ethanol represented 16.7% of the country's total energy consumption by the automotive sector in 2007.27

Sugarcane has been cultivated in Brazil since 1532 as sugar was one of the first commodities exported to Europe by the Portuguese settlers.29 The first use of sugarcane ethanol as a fuel in Brazil dates back to the late twenties and early thirties of the twentieth century, with the introduction of the automobile in the country.30 Ethanol fuel production peaked during World War II and, as German submarine attacks threatened oil supplies, the mandatory blend became as high as 50 percent in 1943.31
After the end of the war cheap oil caused gasoline to prevail, and ethanol blends were only used sporadically, mostly to take advantage of sugar surpluses,32 until the seventies, when the first oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness of the dangers of oil dependence.3334 As a response to this crisis, the Brazilian government began promoting bioethanol as a fuel. The National Alcohol Program -Pr&lt;U+00F3&gt;-&lt;U+00C1&gt;lcool- (), launched in 1975, was a nation-wide program financed by the government to phase out automobile fuels derived from fossil fuels, such as gasoline, in favor of ethanol produced from sugar cane.353637  The first phase of the program concentrated on production of anhydrous ethanol for blending with gasoline.38 The Brazilian government made mandatory the blending of ethanol fuel with gasoline, fluctuating from 1976 until 1992 between 10% to 22%.39 Due to this mandatory minimum gasoline blend, pure gasoline (E0) is no longer sold in the country. A federal law was passed in October 1993 establishing a mandatory blend of 22% anhydrous ethanol (E22) in the entire country. This law also authorized the Executive to set different percentages of ethanol within pre-established boundaries; and since 2003 these limits were fixed at a maximum of 25% (E25) and a minimum of 20% (E20) by volume.4041 Since then, the government has set the percentage of the ethanol blend according to the results of the sugarcane harvest and the levels of ethanol production from sugarcane, resulting in blend variations even within the same year.42 Since July 2007 the mandatory blend is 25% of anhydrous ethanol and 75% gasoline or E25 blend.43  After testing in government fleets with several prototypes developed by the local carmakers, and compelled by the second oil crisis, the Fiat 147, the first modern commercial ethanol-only powered car (E100 only) was launched to the market in July 1979.44 The Brazilian government provided three important initial drivers for the ethanol industry: guaranteed purchases by the state-owned oil company Petrobras, low-interest loans for agro-industrial ethanol firms, and fixed gasoline and ethanol prices where hydrous ethanol sold for 59% of the government-set gasoline price at the pump. These incentives made ethanol production competitive.45 After reaching more than 4 million cars and light trucks running on pure ethanol by the late 1980s,46 representing one third of the country's motor vehicle fleet,47 ethanol production and sales of ethanol-only cars tumbled due to several factors. First, gasoline prices fell sharply as a result of lower gasoline prices, but mainly because of a shortage of ethanol fuel supply in the local market left thousands of vehicles in line at gas stations or out of fuel in their garages by mid 1989.4849 As supply could not keep pace with the increasing demand required by the now significant ethanol-only fleet, the Brazilian government began importing ethanol in 1991.5051  Confidence on ethanol-powered vehicles was restored only with the introduction in the Brazilian market of flexible-fuel vehicles. In March 2003 Volkswagen launched in the Brazilian market the Gol 1.6 Total Flex, the first commercial flexible fuel vehicle capable of running on any blend of gasoline and ethanol.5253 54. By 2008, popular manufacturers that build flexible fuel vehicles are Chevrolet, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault ,Volkswagen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota and Citr&lt;U+00F6&gt;en.55 Flexible fuel cars were 22% of the car sales in 2004, 73% in 200556, and reached 87.6% in July 2008.57 The rapid adoption and commercial success of &quot;flex&quot; vehicles, as they are popularly known, together with the mandatory blend of alcohol with gasoline as E25 fuel, have increased ethanol consumption up to the point that by February 2008 a landmark in ethanol consumption was achieved when ethanol retail sales surpassed the 50% market share of the gasoline-powered fleet.5859 This level of ethanol fuel consumption had not been reached since the end of the 1980s, at the peak of the Pr&lt;U+00F3&gt;-&lt;U+00C1&gt;lcool Program.606162 Also, from 1979 until October 2008, Brazil has successfully reduced by 12.5 million the number of vehicles running just on gasoline (5.7 million ethanol-only and 6.8 million flex-fuel vehicles),6364 thereby reducing the country's dependence on oil imports. The number of ethanol-only vehicles still in use is estimated between 2 to 3 million vehicles.65
Under the auspices of the BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport (BEST) project, the first ethanol-powered (E95) bus began operations in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo city on December 2007 as a one-year trial project.666768 During the trial period performance and emissions will be monitored as significant reductions are expected in carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions,69 and as previous tests have shown a reduction in fuel economy of around 60% when E95 is compared to regular diesel.70 The latest innovation within the Brazilian flexible-fuel technology is the development of flex-fuel motorcycles,71 that are expected to be launched in the market by 2009.72

 Ethanol production in Brazil uses sugarcane as feedstock and relies on first-generation technologies based on the use of the sucrose content of sugarcane. Ethanol yield has grown 3.77% per year since 1975 and productivity gains been based on improvements in the agricultural and industrial phases of the production process. Further improvements on best practices are expected to allow in the short to mid-term an average ethanol productivity of 9,000 liters per hectare.75
There were 378 ethanol plants operating in Brazil by July 2008, 126 dedicated to ethanol production and 252 producing both sugar and ethanol. There are 15 additional plants dedicated exclusively to sugar production.76 These plants have an installed capacity of crushing 538 million metric tons of sugarcane per year, and there are 25 plants under construction expected to be on line by 2009 that will add an additional capacity of crushing 50 million tons of sugarcane per year.77 The typical plant cost approximately USD 150 million and requires a nearby sugarcane plantation of 30,000 hectares.78
Ethanol production is concentrated in the Central and Southeast regions of the country, led by S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state, with around 60% of the country's total ethanol production, followed by Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; (8%), Minas Gerais (8%) and Goi&lt;U+00E1&gt;s (5%).79 These two regions have been responsible for 90% of Brazil's ethanol production since 20058081 and the harvest season goes from April to November. The Northeast Region is responsible for the remaining 10% of ethanol production, lead by Alagoas with 2% of total production.82 The harvest season in the North-Northeast region goes from September to March, and the average productivity in this region is lower than the South-Central region.83 Due to the difference in the two main harvest seasons, Brazilian statistics for sugar and ethanol production are commonly reported on a harvest two-year basis rather than on a calendar year.
For the 2008/09 harvest it is expected that approximately 44 percent of the sugarcane will be used for sugar, 1% for alcoholic beverages, and 55% for ethanol production.84 An estimate of between 24.9 billion litres (6.58 billion U.S. liquid gallons)85 to 27.1 billion litres (7.16 billion gallons)86 of ethanol are expected to be produced in 2008/09 harvest year, with most of the production being destined for the internal market, and only 4.2 billion liters (1.1 billion gallons) for exports, with an estimated 2.5 billion liters (660 million gallons) destined for the US market.87 Sugarcane cultivated area grew from 7 million to 7.8 million hectares of land from 2007 to 2008, mainly using abandoned pasture lands.88 In 2008 Brazil has 276 million hectares of arable land, 72% use for pasture, 16.9% for grain crops, and 2.8% for sugarcane, meaning that ethanol is just requiring approximately 1.5% of all arable land available in the country.89
As sugar and ethanol share the same feedstock and their industrial processing is fully integrated, formal employment statistics are usually presented together. In 2000 there were 642,848 workers employed by these industries, and as ethanol production expanded, by 2005 there were 982,604 workers employed in the sugarcane cultivation and industrialization, including 414,668 workers in the sugarcane fields, 439,573 workers in the sugar mills, and 128,363 workers in the ethanol distilleries.90 While employment in the ethanol distilleries grew 88.4% from 2000 to 2005, employment in the sugar fields just grew 16.2% as a direct result of expansion of mechanical harvest instead manual harvesting, which avoids burning the sugarcane fields before manual cutting and also increases productivity. The states with the most employment in 2005 were S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo (39.2%), Pernambuco (15%), Alagoas (14.1%), Paran&lt;U+00E1&gt; (7%), and Minas Gerais (5.6%).91
Agricultural technology
     A key aspect for the development of the ethanol industry in Brazil was the investment in agricultural research and development by both the public and private sector.92 The work of EMBRAPA, the state-owned company in charge for applied research on agriculture, together with research developed by state institutes and universities, especially in the State of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, have allowed Brazil to became a major innovator in the fields of biotechnology and agronomic practices,93 resulting in the most efficient agricultural technology for sugarcane cultivation in the world.94 Efforts have been concentrated in increasing the efficiency of inputs and processes to optimize output per hectare of feedstock, and the result has been a threefold increase of sugarcane yields in 29 years, as Brazilian average ethanol yields went from 2,024 liters per ha in 1975 to 5,917 liters per ha in 2004; allowing the efficiency of ethanol production to grow at a rate of 3.77% per year.95 Brazilian biotechnologies include the development of sugarcane varieties that have a larger sugar or energy content, one of the main drivers for high yields of ethanol per unit of planted area. The increase of the index total recoverable sugar (TRS) from sugarcane has been very significant, 1.5% per year in the period 1977 to 2004, resulting in an increase from 95 to 140 kg/ha.96 Innovations in the industrial process have allowed an increase in sugar extraction in the period 1977 to 2003. The average annual improvement was 0.3%; some mills have already reached extraction efficiencies of 98%.97
Biotechnology research and genetic improvement have led to the development of strains which are more resistant to disease, bacteria, and pests, and also have the capacity to respond to different environments, thus allowing the expansion of sugarcane cultivation to areas previously considered inaqueate for such cultures.9899100 By 2008 more than 500 sugarcane varieties are cultivated in Brazil, and 51 of them were released just during the last ten years. Four research programs, two private and two public, are devoted to further genetic improvement.101102 Since the mid nineties, Brazilian biotechnology laboratories have developed transgenic varieties, still non commerciallized. Identification of 40,000 cane genes was completed in 2003 and there are a couple dozen research groups working on the functional genome, still on the experimental phase, but commercial results are expected within five years.103
Also, there is ongoing research regarding sugarcane biological nitrogen fixation, with the most promising plant varieties showing yields three times the national average in soils of very low fertility, thus avoiding nitrogenous fertilization.104 There is also research for the development of second-generation or cellulosic ethanol.105 In S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state an increase of 12% in sugar cane yield and 6.4% in sugar content is expected over the next decade. This advance combined with an expected 6.2% improvement in fermentation efficiency and 2% in sugar extraction, may increase ethanol yields by 29%, raising average ethanol productivity to 9,000 liters/ha.106 Approximately US$50 million has recently been allocated for research and projects focused on advancing the obtention of ethanol from sugarcane in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state.107
Production process
Sucrose extracted from sugarcane accounts for little more than 30% of the chemical energy stored in the mature plant; 35% is in the leaves and stem tips, which are left in the fields during harvest, and 35% are in the fibrous material (bagasse) left over from pressing. Most of the industrial processing of sugarcane in Brazil is done through a very integrated production chain, allowing sugar production, industrial ethanol processing, and electricity generation from byproducts.108109 The typical steps for large scale production of sugar and ethanol include milling, electricity generation, fermentation, distillation of ethanol, and dehydration.
Milling and refining
Once harvested, sugarcane is usually transported to the plant by semi-trailer trucks. After quality control sugarcane is washed, chopped, and shredded by revolving knives. The feedstock is fed to and extracted by a set of mill combinations to collect a juice, called garapa in Brazil, that contain 10–15 percent sucrose, and bagasse, the fiber residue. The main objective of the milling process is to extract the largest possible amount of sucrose from the cane, and a secondary but important objective is the production of bagasse with a low moisture content as boiler fuel, as bagasse is burned for electricity generation (see below), allowing the plant to be self-sufficient in energy and to generate electricity for the local power grid.110 The cane juice or garapa is then filtered and treated by chemicals and pasteurized. Before evaporation, the juice is filtered once again, producing vinasse, a fluid rich in organic compounds. The syrup resulting from evaporation is then precipitated by crystallization producing a mixture of clear crystals surrounded by molasses. A centrifuge is used to separate the sugar from molasses, and the crystals are washed by addition of steam, after which the crystals are dried by an airflow. Upon cooling, sugar crystallizes out of the syrup.111 From this point, the sugar refining process continues to produced different types of sugar, and the molasses continue a separate process to produce ethanol.
Fermentation, destillation and dehydration
The resulting molasses are treated to become a sterilized molasse free of impurities, ready to be fermented. In the fermentation process sugars are transformed into ethanol by addition of yeast. Fermentation time varies from four to twelve hours resulting in an alcohol content of 7 to 10 percent by total volume (&lt;U+00B0&gt;GL), called fermented wine. The yeast is recovered from this wine through a centrifuge. Making use of the different boiling points the alcohol in the fermented wine is separated from the main resting solid components. The remaining product is hydrated ethanol with a concentration of 96&lt;U+00B0&gt;GL,112 the highest concentration of ethanol that can be achieved via azeotropicdistillation, and by national specification can contain up to 4.9% of water by volume.113 This hydrous ethanol is the fuel used by ethanol-only and flex vehicles in the country. Further dehydration is normally done by addition of chemicals, up to the specified 99.7&lt;U+00B0&gt;GL in order to produce anhydrous ethanol,114 which is used for blending with pure gasoline to obtain the country's E25 mandatory blend.115 The additional processing required to convert hydrated into anhydrous ethanol increases the cost of the fuel, as in 2007 the average producer price difference between the two was around 14% for S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo State.116 This production price difference, though small, contributes to the competitiveness of the hydrated ethanol (E100) used in Brazil, not only with regard to local gasoline prices but also as compared to other countries such as the US and Sweden, that only use anhydrous ethanol for their flex fuel fleet.117
Electricity generation from bagasse
Since the early days bagasse was burnt in the plant to provide the energy required for the industrial part of the process. Today, the Brazilian best practice uses high-pressure boilers that increases energy recovery, allowing most sugar-ethanol plants to be energetically self-sufficient and even sell surplus electricity to utilities.118 By 2000, the total amount of sugarcane bagasse produced per year was 50 million tons/dry basis out of more than 300 million tons of harvested sugarcane. Several authors estimated a potential power generation from the use of sugarcane bagasse ranging from 1,000 to 9,000 MW, depending on the technology used and the use of harvest trash. One utility in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo is buying more than 1% of its electricity from sugar mills, with a production capacity of 600 MW for self-use and 100 MW for sale.119 According to analysis from Frost &amp; Sullivan, Brazil's sugarcane bagasse used for power generation has reached 3.0 GW in 2007, and it is expected to reach 12.2 GW in 2014. The analysis also found tha sugarcane bagasse cogeneration accounts for 3% of the total Brazilian energy matrix.120 The energy is especially valuable to utilities because it is produced mainly in the dry season when hydroelectric dams are running low.
According to a study commissioned by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol &quot;...there are also substantial gains possible in the efficiency of electricity use and generation: The electricity used for distillery operations has been estimated at 12.9 kWh/tonne cane, with a best available technology rate of 9.6 kWh/tonne cane . For electricity generation the efficiency could be increased from 18 kWh/tonne cane presently, to 29.1 kWh/tonne cane maximum. The production of surplus electricity could in theory be increased from 5.3 kWh/tonne cane to 19 kWh/tonne cane&quot;.121
There are several improvements to the industrial processes, such as adopting a hydrolysis process to produce ethanol instead of surplus electricity, or the use of advanced boiler and turbine technology to increase the electricity yield, or a higher use of excess bagasse and harvest trash currently left behind in the fields, that together with various other efficiency improvements in sugarcane farming and the distribution chain have the potential to allow further efficiency increases, translating into higher yields, lower production costs, and also further improvements in the energy balance and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.122

Brazil is the world's largest exporter of ethanol. In 2007 it exported 933.4 million gallons (3,532.7 million liters),127128 representing almost 20% of its production, and accounting for almost 50% of the global exports. 129 Since 2004 Brazilian exporters have as their main customers the United States, Netherlands, Japan, Sweden, Jamaica, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Nigeria, Mexico, India, and South Korea.130
The countries in the Caribbean Basin import relative high quantities of Brazilian ethanol, but not much is destined for domestic consumption. These countries reprocess the product, usually converting Brazilian hydrated ethanol into anhydrous ethanol, and then re-export it to the United States, gaining value-added and avoiding the 2.5 percent duty and the USD 0,54 per gallon tariff, thanks to the trade agreements and benefits granted by Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). This process is limited by a quota, set at 7% of U.S. ethanol consumption.131 Although direct U.S. exports fell in 2007, imports from four CBI countries almost doubled, increasing from 15.5% in 2006 to 25.8% in 2007, reflecting increasing re-exports to the U.S., thus partially compensating the loss of Brazilian direct exports to the U.S. This situation has caused some concerns in the United States, as it and Brazil are trying to build a partnership to increase ethanol production in Latin American and the Caribbean. As the U.S. is encouraging &quot;new ethanol production in other countries, production that could directly compete with U.S.-produced ethanol&quot;.132
The U.S., potentially the largest market for the Brazilian ethanol, currently imposes trade restrictions on Brazilian ethanol of $USD 0.54 per gallon, in order to encourage domestic ethanol production, most of which has so far been based on processing corn instead of sugar cane or soybeans, which is much less efficient. There is concern that allowing the Brazilian ethanol to enter the U.S. market without taxation will undercut the budding ethanol industry in the United States.133 One of the arguments for that is that Brazil currently subsidises its ethanol production, which is false, as the subsidies program finished in the 1990s.134 Others argue that rather than impose trade restrictions on the import of the Brazilian product, that the U.S. should make subsidies of its own available to support its fledgling domestic producers. Exports of Brazilian ethanol to the U.S. reached a total of US$ 1 billion in 2006, an increase of 1,020% over 2005 (US$ 98 millions),135 but fell significantly in 2007 due to sharp increases in American ethanol production from maize.136137
As shown in the table, together, the United States, the European Union, the CBI countries with Mexico, and Japan, were the destination of 91% of Brazilian ethanol exports, both in 2007 and 2006. As of 2007, the European Union region, led by the Netherlands, is the main importer of Brazilian ethanol, with 265.3 million gallons (1,004.2 million liters)138. However, and despite of reduced direct imports, the United States continues to be the single one country where Brazilian ethanol is exported, reaching 228.96 million gallons (866.6 million liters) to the continental U.S., 13.78 million gallons (52.1 million liters) shipped to the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 3.68 million gallons (14.0 million litters) shipped to Puerto Rico, for a total export for the U.S. in 2007 of 246.4 million gallons (932.75 million liters),139 down from 469.6 million gallons (1.77 billion liters) in 2006.140
Prices and effect on oil consumption
  Most automobiles in Brazil run either on hydrous alcohol (E100) or on gasohol (E25 blend), as the mixture of 25% anhydrous ethanol with gasoline is mandatory in the entire country.141 Since 2003, dual-fuel ethanol flex vehicles that run on any proportion of hydrous ethanol and gasoline have been gaining popularity, surpassing 6 million new cars and light commercial vehicles sold by August 2008,142 and as the same month, 75% of light vehicle manufacturing production is flexible fuel without additional cost for buyers.143 Customers have 49 models available to chose from. Brazilian full flex-fuel vehicles have electronic sensors that automatically detect the type of fuel and the blend mix, and accordingly adjust the engine combustion. Users have the freedom to choose depending on the free market prices of each fuel.144
Due to the lower energy content of ethanol fuel, full flex-fuel vehicles get fewer miles per gallon. Ethanol price has to be between 25-30% cheaper per gallon to reach the break even point.145 As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the harvest yields and seasonal fluctuation of sugarcane harvest.146147Since 2005, ethanol prices have been very competitive without any subsidies,148 even with gasoline prices kept constant in local currency since mid-2005,149 at a time when oil was just approaching USD 60 a barrel. The price ratio between gasoline and ethanol fuel has been well above 30% during this period for most states, except during low sugar cane supply between harvests and for states located far away from the ethanol production centers. According to Brazilian producers, ethanol can remain competitive if the price of oil does not fall below USD 30 a barrel.150
By 2008 consumption of ethanol fuel by the Brazilian fleet of light vehicles, as pure ethanol and in gasohol, is replacing gasoline at the rate of about 27,000 cubic metres per day, and by February 2008 the combined consumption of anhydrous and hydrated ethanol fuel surpassed 50% of the fuel that would be needed to run the light vehicle fleet on pure gasoline alone. Consumption of anhydrous ethanol for the mandatory E25 blend, together with hydrous ethanol used by flex vehicles, reached 1.432 billion liters, while pure gasoline consumption was 1.411 billion liters.151152
However, the effect on the country's overall petroleum consumption was smaller than that, as domestic oil consumption still far outweighs ethanol consumption. In 2005, Brazil consumed  of oil per day, versus  of ethanol.153 Although Brazil is a major oil producer and now exports gasoline (19,000 m&lt;U+00B3&gt;/day), it still must import oil because of internal demand for other oil byproducts, chiefly diesel fuel, which cannot be easily replaced by ethanol. When trucks and other diesel-powered vehicles are considered ethanol represented 16.9% of total energy consumption by the road transport sector in terms of energy equivalent to crude oil, and 14.9% of the entire transport sector.154
Consumer price spread between E25 gasoline and E100 by state. Red and orange show states with average prices below the break even range. Ethanol price should be between 25 to 30% cheaper than gasoline to compensate its lower fuel economy.

Comparison with the United States
Brazil's sugar cane-based industry is more efficient than the U.S. corn-based industry. Sugar cane ethanol has an energy balance seven times greater than ethanol produced from corn.158 Brazilian distillers are able to produce ethanol for 22 cents per liter, compared with the 30 cents per liter for corn-based ethanol.159 U.S. corn-derived ethanol costs 30% more because the corn starch must first be converted to sugar before being distilled into alcohol.160 Despite this cost differential in production, the U.S. does not import more Brazilian ethanol because of U.S. trade barriers corresponding to a tariff of 54-cent per gallon – a levy designed to offset the 51-cent per gallon blender's federal tax credit that is applied to ethanol no matter its country of origin.161
Sugarcane cultivation requires a tropical or subtropical climate, with a minimum of 600 mm (24 in) of annual rainfall. Sugarcane is one of the most efficient photosynthesizers in the plant kingdom, able to convert up to 2% of incident solar energy into biomass. Sugarcane production in the United States occurs in Florida, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Texas. The first three plants to produce sugarcane-based ethanol are expected to go online in Louisiana by mid 2009. Sugar mill plants in Lacassine, St. James and Bunkie were converted to sugar cane-based ethanol production using Colombian technology in order to make possible a profitable ethanol production. These three plants will produce 100 million gallons of ethanol within five years.162 By 2009 two other sugarcane ethanol production projects are being developed in Kauai, Hawaii and Imperial Valley, California.163

Ethanol diplomacy
  In March 2007, &quot;ethanol diplomacy&quot; was the focus of President George W. Bush's Latin American tour, in which he and Brazil's president, Luiz In&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio Lula da Silva, were seeking to promote the production and use of sugar cane based ethanol throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. The two countries also agreed to share technology and set international standards for biofuels.192 The Brazilian sugar cane technology transfer will permit various Central American, such as Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, several Caribbean countries, and various Andean Countries tariff-free trade with the U.S. thanks to existing concessionary trade agreements.
Even though the U.S. imposes a USD 0.54 tariff on every gallon of imported ethanol, the Caribbean nations and Central American countries are exempt from such duties based on the benefits granted by the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI).193 CBI provisions allow tariff-free access to the US market from ethanol produced from foreign feedstock (outside CBI countries) up to 7% of the previous year US consumption. Also additional quotas are allowed if the beneficiary countries produce at least 30 percent of the ethanol from local feedstocks up to an additional 35 million gallons.194 Thus, several countries have been importing hydrated ethanol from Brazil, processing it at local distilleries to dehydrate it, and then re-exporting it as anhydrous ethanol.195 American farmers have complained about this loophole to legally bypass the tariff.196197 The 2005 Dominican Republic &lt;U+2013&gt; Central America Free Trade Agreement(CAFTA) maintained the benefits granted by the CBI, and CAFTA provisions established country-specific shares for Costa Rica and El Salvador within the overall quota. An initial annual allowance was established for each country, with gradually-increasing annual levels of access to the US market.198 The expectation is that using Brazilian technology for refining sugar cane based ethanol, such countries could become net exporters to the United States in the short-term.199 In August 2007, Brazil's President toured Mexico and several countries in Central America and the Caribbean to promote Brazilian ethanol technology.200
The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that the American and Brazilian presidents signed in March 2007 has been described as a success for foreign policy, bringing Brazil and the United States closer especially on energy policy. Nevertheless, policy makers have cited a lack of &quot;substantive progress&quot; implementing the three pillars found in that agreement and have called for an expansion of international engagement beyond the executive branches.201  Brazil has also extended its technical expertise to several African countries, including Ghana,202Mozambique,203 Angola,204 and Kenya.205 This effort is led by EMBRAPA, the state-owned company in charge for applied research on agriculture, and responsible for most of the achievements in increasing sugarcane productivity during the last thirty years. Another 15 African countries have shown interest in receiving Brazilian technical aid to improve sugarcane productivity and to produced ethanol efficiently.206 Brazil also has bilateral cooperation agreements with several other countries in Europe and Asia.207
As President Lula wrote for The Economist208 regarding Brazil's global agenda: &quot;Brazil&lt;U+2019&gt;s ethanol and biodiesel programmes are a benchmark for alternative and renewable fuel sources. Partnerships are being established with developing countries seeking to follow Brazil&lt;U+2019&gt;s achievements&lt;U+2014&gt;a 675m-tonne reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions, a million new jobs and a drastic reduction in dependence on imported fossil fuels coming from a dangerously small number of producer countries. All of this has been accomplished without compromising food security, which, on the contrary, has benefited from rising agricultural output...We are setting up offices in developing countries interested in benefiting from Brazilian know-how in this field.&quot;.
Environmental and social impacts
Environmental effects
Benefits
Ethanol produced from sugarcane provides energy that is renewable and less carbon intensive than oil. Bioethanol reduces air pollution thanks to its cleaner emissions, and also contributes to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, several environmental and social issues and concerns have been raised regarding the Brazilian ethanol program.209 Among the most controversial are the risks associated with the expansion of agricultural land and its direct or indirect impact on natural habitats, and the carbon footprint associated to future land use changes as ethanol production expands beyond the existing arable lands.210211212
Energy Balance
One of the main concerns about bioethanol production is the energy balance, the total amount of energy input into the process compared to the energy released by burning the resulting ethanol fuel. This balance considers the full cycle of producing the fuel, as cultivation, transportation and production require energy, including the use of oil and fertilizers. A comprehensive life cycle assessment commissioned by the State of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo found that Brazilian sugarcane based ethanol has a favorable energy balance, varying from 8.3 for average conditions to 10.2 for best practice production.213 This means that for average conditions one unit of fossil-fuel energy is required to create 8.3 energy units from the resulting ethanol. These findings have been confirmed by other studies.214215216 
Greenhouse gas emissions
Another benefit of bioethanol is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as compared to gasoline, because as much carbon dioxide is taken up by the growing plants as is produced when the bioethanol is burnt, with a zero theoretical net contribution.217 Several studies have shown that sugarcane based ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by 86 to 90% if there is no significant land use change,218219220 and ethanol from sugarcane is regarded the most efficient biofuel currently under commercial production in terms of GHG emission reduction.221222 However, a study published in 2008223 is critical of previous assessments of greenhouse gas emissions, as the authors considered that these studies did not take into account the effect of land use changes.224 (see below &quot;Effects of land use change&quot;)
Air pollution
The widespread use of ethanol brought several environmental benefits to urban centers regarding air pollution. Lead additives to gasoline were reduced through the 1980s as the amount of ethanol blended in the fuel was increased, and these additives were completely eliminated by 1991. The addition of ethanol blends instead of lead to gasoline lowered the total carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons, sulfur emissions, and particulate matter significantly.225 The use of ethanol-only vehicles has also reduced CO emissions drastically. Before the Pr&lt;U+00F3&gt;-&lt;U+00C1&gt;lcool Program started, when gasoline was the only fuel in use, CO emissions were higher than 50 g/km driven; they had been reduced to less than 5.8 g/km in 1995.226 Several studies have also shown that S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo has benefit with significantly less air pollution thanks to ethanol's cleaner emissions.227 Furthermore, Brazilian flex-fuel engines are being designed with higher compression ratios, taking advantage of the higher ethanol blends and maximizing the benefits of the higher oxygen content of ethanol, resulting in lower emissions and improving fuel efficiency.228
Even though all automotive fossil fuels emit aldehydes, one of the drawbacks of the use of hydrated ethanol in ethanol-only engines is the increase in aldehyde emissions as compared with gasoline or gasohol.229 However, the present ambient concentrations of aldehyde, in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo city are below the reference levels recommended as adequate to human health found in the literature.230 Other concern is that because formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions are significantly higher, and although both aldehydes occur naturally and are frequently found in the open environment, additional emissions may be important because of their role in smog formation. However, more research is required to establish the extent and direct consequences, if any, on health.231
Issues
Water use and fertilizers
Ethanol production has also raised concerns regarding water overuse and pollution, soil erosion and possible contamination by excessive use of fertilizers.232233234 A study commissioned by the Dutch government in 2006 to evaluate the sustainability of Brazilian bioethanol concluded that there is sufficient water to supply all foreseeable long-term water requirements for sugarcane and ethanol production. Also, and as a result of legislation and technological progress, the amount of water collected for ethanol production has decreased considerably during the previous years. The overuse of water resources seems a limited problem in general in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, particularly because of the relatively high rainfall, yet, some local problems may occur. Regarding water pollution due to sugarcane production, Embrapa classifies the industry as level 1, which means &lt;U+201C&gt;no impact&lt;U+201D&gt; on water quality.235236
This evaluation also found that consumption of agrochemicals for sugar cane production is lower than in citric, corn, coffee and soybean cropping. Disease and pest control, including the use of agrochemicals, is a crucial element in all cane production. The study found that development of resistant sugar cane varieties is a crucial aspect of disease and pest control and is one of the primary objectives of Brazil&lt;U+2019&gt;s cane genetic improvement programs. Disease control is one of the main reasons for the replacement of a commercial variety of sugar cane.237
Field burning
Advancements in fertilizers and natural pesticides have all but eliminated the need to burn fields.238 Sugarcane fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash.239 There has been less burning due to pressure from the public and health authorities, and as a result of the recent development of effective harvesting machines. A 2001 state law banned burning in sugarcane fields in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state by 2021,240 and machines will gradually replace human labor as the means of harvesting cane, except where the abrupt terrain does not allow for mechanical harvesting. However, 150 out of 170 of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo's sugar cane processing plants signed in 2007 a voluntary agreement with the state government to comply by 2014.241242 Independent growers signed in 2008 the voluntary agreement to comply, and the deadline was extended to 2017 for sugar cane fields located in more abrupt terrain.243 By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.244245 Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, but also will create unemployment for these seasonal workers, many of them coming from the poorest regions of Brazil. Due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined.246
Effects of land use change
A study published in 2008 questioned the benefits estimated in previous assessments regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from sugarcane based ethanol, as the authors consider that these studies did not take into account the effect of land use changes.247248 The authors found a &quot;biofuel carbon debt&quot; is created when Brazil and other developing countries convert land in undisturbed ecosystems, such as rainforests, savannas, or grasslands, to biofuel production, and to crop production when agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production. This land use change releases more CO2 than the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that these biofuels would provide by displacing fossil fuels. Among others, the study analyzed the case of Brazilian Cerrado being converted for sugarcane ethanol production. The biofuel carbon debt on converted Cerrado is estimated to be repaid in 17 years, the least amount of time of the scenarios that were analyzed, as for example, ethanol from US corn was estimated to have a 93 year payback time. The study conclusion is that the net effect of biofuel production via clearing of carbon-rich habitats is to increase CO2 emissions for decades or centuries relative to fossil fuel use.249
Regarding this concern, previous studies conducted in Brazil have shown there are 355 million ha of arable land in Brazil, of which only 72 million ha are in use.250 Sugarcane is only taking 2% of arable land available,251 of which ethanol production represented 55% in 2008.252 Embrapa estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least 30 times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops.253 Most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned pasture lands, as it has been the historical trend in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state.254255256257 Also, productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research, genetic improvement, and better agronomic practices, thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures.258259 This trend is demonstrated by the increases in agricultural production that took place in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state between 1990 and 2004, where coffee, orange, sugarcane and other food crops were grown in an almost constant area.260
Also regarding the potential negative impacts of land use changes on carbon emissions, a study commissioned by the Dutch government concluded that &quot;it is very difficult to determine the indirect effects of further land use for sugar cane production (i.e. sugar cane replacing another crop like soy or citrus crops, which in turn causes additional soy plantations replacing pastures, which in turn may cause deforestation), and also not logical to attribute all these soil carbon losses to sugar cane&quot;.261 Other authors have also questioned these indirect effects, as cattle pastures are displaced to the cheaper land near the Amazon.262263 Studies rebutting this concern claim tha land devoted to free grazing cattle is shrinking, as density of cattle on pasture land increased from 1.28 heads of cattle/ha to 1.41 from 2001 to 2005,264 and further improvements are expected in cattle feeding practices.265
Deforestation
 Other criticism have focused on the potential for clearing rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazonia, the Pantanal or the Cerrado.266267268269270 Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000 km from the Amazonia, and expansion during the last 25 years took place in the Center-South region, also far away from the Amazonia, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands.271272
The impact assessment regarding future changes in land use, forest protection and risks on biodiversity conducted as part of the study commissioned by the Dutch government273 concluded that &quot;the direct impact of cane production on biodiversity is limited, because cane production replaces mainly pastures and/or food crop and sugar cane production takes place far from the major biomes in Brazil (Amazon Rain Forest, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Campos Sulinos and Pantanal)&quot;. However, &quot;...the indirect impacts from an increase of the area under sugar cane production are likely more severe. The most important indirect impact would be an expansion of the area agricultural land at the expense of cerrados. The cerrados are an important biodiversity reserve. These indirect impacts are difficult to quantify and there is a lack of practically applicable criteria and indicators.&quot;274
Brazil's president, Luiz In&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio Lula da Silva has also claimed this concern is not valid. According to him &quot;The Portuguese discovered a long time ago that the Amazon isn't a place to plant cane.&quot;275 In order to guarantee a sustainable development of ethanol production, the government is working on a countrywide zoning plan to restrict sugarcane growth in or near environmentally sensitive areas, allowing only the eight existing plants to remain operating in these sensitive areas, but without further extension of their sugarcane fields.276 The proposed restricted area has 4.6 million square kilometers, almost half of the Brazilian territory.
Social implications
 Sugarcane has had an important social contribution to the some of the poorest people in Brazil by providing income usually above the minimum wage, and a formal job with fringe benefits.277278 Formal employment in Brazil accounts an average 45% across all sectors, while the sugarcane sector has a share of 72.9% formal jobs in 2007, up from 53.6% in 1992, and in the more developed sugarcane ethanol industry in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state formal employment reached 93.8% in 2005.279 Average wages in sugar cane and ethanol production are above the official minimum wage, but minimum wages may be insufficient to avoid poverty.280 The North-Northeast regions stands out for having much lower levels of education among workers and lower monthly income. The average number workers with 3 or less school years in Brazil is 58.8%, while in the Southeast this percentage is 46.2%, in the Northeast region is 76,4%.281 Therefore, earnings in the Center-South are not surprisingly higher than those in the North-Northeast for comparable levels of education.282 In 2005 sugarcane harvesting workers in the Center-South region received an average wage 58.7% higher than the average wage in the North-Northeast region.283 The main social problems are related to cane cutters which do most of the low-paid work related to ethanol production.284
The total number of permanent employees in the sector fell by one-third between 1992 and 2003, in part due to the increasing reliance on mechanical harvesting, especially in the richest and more mature sugarcane producers of S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo state. During the same period, the share of temporary or seasonal workers has fluctuated, first declining and then increasing in recent years to about one-half of the total jobs in the sector, but in absolute terms the number of temporary workers has declined also.285 The sugarcane sector in the poorer Northeast region is more labor intensive as production in this region represents only 18.6% of the country's total production but employs 44.3% of worker force in the sugarcane sector.286
The manual harvesting of sugarcane has been associated with hardship and poor working conditions.287288289 In this regard, the study commissioned by the Dutch government290 confirmed that the main problem is indeed related to manual cane harvesting. A key problem in working conditions is the high work load. As a result of mechanization the workload per worker has increased from 4 to 6 ton per day in the eighties to 8 to 10 ton per day in the nineties, up to 12 to 15 ton per day in 2007, and if the quota is not fulfill workers can be fired.291292 Producers say this problem will disappear with greater mechanization in the next decade.293 Also, as mechanization of the harvesting is increasing and only feasible in flat terrain, more workers are being used in areas where conditions are not suitable for mechanized harvesting equipment, such as rough areas where the crops are planted irregularly, making working conditions harder and more hazardous.294
Also unhealthy working conditions and even cases of slavery and deaths from overwork (cane cutting) have been reported,295 but these are likely worst-case examples.296 Even though sufficiently strict labor laws are present in Brazil, enforcement is weak.297 Displacement and seasonal labor also implies physical and cultural disruption of multifunctional family farms and traditional communities.298
Regarding social responsibility the ethanol production sector maintains more than 600 schools, 200 nursery centers and 300 day care units, as legislation requires that 1% of the net sugar cane price and 2% of the net ethanol price must be devoted to medical, dental, pharmaceutical, sanitary, and educational services for sugar cane workers. In practice more than 90% of the mills provide health and dental care, transportation and collective life insurance, and over 80% provide meals and pharmaceutical care. However, for the temporary low wage workers in cane cutting these services may not be available. 299
Effect on food prices
Some environmentalists, such as George Monbiot, have expressed fears that the marketplace will convert crops to fuel for the rich, while the poor starve and biofuels cause environmental problems.300 Environmental groups have raised concerns about this trade-off for several years.301302303304 The food vs fuel debate reached a global scale in 2008 as a result of the international community's concerns regarding the steep increase in food prices. On April 2008, Jean Ziegler, back then United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, called biofuels a &quot;crime against humanity&quot;,305306 a claim he had previously made in October 2007, when he called for a 5-year ban for the conversion of land for the production of biofuels.307308 Also on April 2008, the World Bank's President, Robert Zoellick, stated that &quot;While many worry about filling their gas tanks, many others around the world are struggling to fill their stomachs. And it's getting more and more difficult every day.&quot;309310311
Luiz In&lt;U+00E1&gt;cio Lula da Silva gave a strong rebuttal, calling these claims &quot;fallacies resulting from commercial interests&quot;, and putting the blame instead on U.S. and European agricultural subsidies, and a problem restricted to U.S. ethanol produced from maize. The Brazilian President has also claimed on several occasions that his country's sugar cane based ethanol industry has not contributed to the food price crises.312313314
A report released by Oxfam in June 2008315 criticized biofuel policies of rich countries as neither a solution to the climate crisis nor the oil crisis, while contributing to the food price crisis. The report concluded that from all biofuels available in the market, Brazilian sugarcane ethanol is &quot;far from perfect&quot; but it is the most favorable biofuel in the world in term of cost and greenhouse gas balance. The report discusses some existing problems and potential risks, and asks the Brazilian government for caution to avoid jeopardizing its environmental and social sustainability. The report also says that: &lt;U+201C&gt;Rich countries spent up to $15 billion last year supporting biofuels while blocking cheaper Brazilian ethanol, which is far less damaging for global food security.&quot;316317
A World Bank research report published on July 2008318 found that from June 2002 to June 2008 &quot;biofuels and the related consequences of low grain stocks, large land use shifts, speculative activity and export bans&quot; accounted for 70 percent to 75 percent of total price rises. The study found that higher oil prices and a weak dollar explain 25-30% of total price rise. The study said that &quot;...large increases in biofuels production in the United States and Europe are the main reason behind the steep rise in global food prices&quot; and also stated that &quot;Brazil's sugar-based ethanol did not push food prices appreciably higher&quot;.319320 The report argues that increased production of biofuels in these developed regions were supported by subsidies and tariffs on imports, and considers that without such policies, price increases worldwide would have been smaller. This research paper also concluded that Brazil's sugar cane based ethanol has not raised sugar prices significantly, and recommends removing tariffs on ethanol imports by both the U.S. and E.U., to allow more efficient producers such as Brazil and other developing countries, including many African countries, to produce ethanol profitably for export to meet the mandates in the E.U. and U.S.321
An economic assessment report also published in July 2008 by the OECD322 agrees with the World Bank report regarding the negative effects of subsidies and trade restrictions, but found that the impact of biofuels on food prices are much smaller. The OECD study is also critical of the limited reduction of GHG emissions achieved from biofuels produced in Europe and North America, concluding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8 percent by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent compared to fossil fuels. The assessment calls on governments for more open markets in biofuels and feedstocks in order to improve efficiency and lower costs.323
A study by the Brazilian research unit of the Funda&lt;U+00E7&gt;&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Get&lt;U+00FA&gt;lio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices.324 concluded that the major driver behind the 2007-2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also that there is no correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.325
