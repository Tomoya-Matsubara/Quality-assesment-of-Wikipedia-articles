Common was a 2014 BBC One 90 minute made-for-television drama, written by Jimmy McGovern and set in North West England. It focused on England's controversial joint enterprise doctrine.1 It was filmed in Southport (although the town is never mentioned)2
First shown on 6 July 2014, the drama examines the issues surrounding a case where the defendants were charged with murder involving joint enterprise or common purpose. McGovern was inspired by the case of 16-year-old Jordan Cunliffe, sentenced under this law for a minimum term of 12 years for the murder of Garry Newlove, despite not taking part in the attack.3
Plot
Johnjo O'Shea is an ordinary 17-year-old, who gives a few friends of his older brother a lift in his brother's car and although he and his family consider him to be an innocent bystander, he ends up in court charged as an accessory to murder, under the doctrine of common purpose, the &quot;common&quot; of the film's title.
Critical reception
The Daily Telegraph gave it 4/5 stars, calling it &quot;profoundly engaging&quot;, with Nico Mirallegro, &quot;giving a fine performance of coiled vulnerability&quot;.4 According to The Guardian, &quot;When Jimmy McGovern gets off his soapbox this is a brutal and devastating drama&quot;, &quot;bleak, powerful drama thick with political intent, which occasionally robs it of its quality&quot;, and &quot;the knockout performance belongs to Susan Lynch, who plays the victim's mother&quot;.5
