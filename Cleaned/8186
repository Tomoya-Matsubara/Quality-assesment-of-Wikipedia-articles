Kayam Khani or Qaimkhani is a Muslim community that claims a Rajput descent from Hindu Chauhan Rajputs. They converted to Islam in the 14th century.12 They are found in the Indian state of Rajasthan and in the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan.
History
The Kayam Khani is a community, which derives its origin from the Hindu Rajputs of Chauhan clan who embraced Islam. Jaan Kavi(Neimat Khan) traced the history of Kayam Khani from its hero Kyam Khan, who laid the foundation for Kayam Khani Nawabi rule in Hissar. He writes that the founder of this community was Mote Rao Chauhan, a Hindu ruler of Daderva state in Churu district. He had four sons named Jainand, Jabar Chand, Jagmal and Karam Chand. It was Karam Chand whom Firuz Shah Tughlaq met within a jungle near Hissar where the young Karam Chand was resting for a while under a tree which was completely covering him to give comfort. Firuz Shah Tughlaq enquired about the young Karam Chand&lt;U+2019&gt;s family details and took him to Delhi. After seeking consent from Mote Rao Chauhan one of his subordinates Firuz Shah sent Karam Chand to Sayyed Nasir for Islamic training. Thus Karam Chand embraced Islam and changed his name to Kayam Khan. Later in his two elder brothers Jaichand and Jabarichand also joined him in the pursuit of Islam. However, it is the descendants of Kayam Khan who were known as Kayam Khani, but in due course the descendants of his brothers, who changed their names to Jainand Khan and Jahardi Khan were also included in the fold of Kayam Khani community. Kayam Khan established his Nawabi rule in Hissar. His sons established Jhunjhunu Nawabi and Fatehpur Nawabi was established by by Fateh Khan in 1934. Kayam Khani are distributed mainly in Churu, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Nagaur districts.3
