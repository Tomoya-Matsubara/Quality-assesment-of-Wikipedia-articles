Future extensions
Boon Lay Extension (BLE)
After months of planning, the Land Transport Authority announced on December 29, 2004, the details of the Boon Lay Extension (BLE). The 3.8 kilometre, 2 station line will extend from Boon Lay Station on the western end of the East West Line, with one station along Jurong West Street 63 between Jurong Street 61 and Pioneer Road North, and the second station at Joo Koon Circle, near the junction of Benoi Road and International Road.
The fully elevated line will cost about S$436 million. Construction commence in the second half of 2005 and is targeted for completion by 2009. The extension's alignment along Jurong West Street 63, Upper Jurong Road, and International Road required the acquisition of one full lot and eight part lots, totalling about 28,000 square metres of land.
