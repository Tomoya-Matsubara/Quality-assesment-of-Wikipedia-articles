Adolf Henrik Lundin, (December 19 1932, Sweden &lt;U+2013&gt; September 30 2006, Geneva, Switzerland), 1 was an independent oil and mining entrepreneur.
Adolf Lundin earned an MSc degree in 1956 from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Between 1957 and 1960 he worked as a Petroleum Engineer for the Royal Dutch Shell Group in South America. In 1961 he earned an MBA degree from the Centre d&lt;U+2019&gt;Etudes Industrielles in Geneva, Switzerland. Between 1961 and 1966 he was responsible for oil exploration activities in the North Sea and Portugal for the Ax:son Johnson Group. In 1966, he moved with his family to Geneva to work as Assistant Director of the Centre d&lt;U+2019&gt;Etudes Industrielles (which later became IMD Lausanne).
In 1971, he started his career as an independent oil and mining entrepreneur on a global scale. His first successful venture was Gulfstream Resources which, in 1976, co-discovered the North Gas Field, offshore Qatar. This field remains today as the single largest known gas accumulation in the world.
From the 1970s through the 1990s Lundin established numerous natural resource companies both in the mining sector and the oil &amp; gas sector, which in turn made a number of world class discoveries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America. Several of these deposits are still producing commercial quantities of oil, gas, gold, copper and other minerals; others are still under development.
In 1998, he was named International Swede of the Year by His Majesty the King of Sweden. In 2002, he received an honorary doctorate degree from Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics in Moscow.
After retirement, he became the Honorary Chairman of Lundin Petroleum AB, the Chairman of Vostok Nafta Investment Ltd and a Director of North Atlantic Natural Resources AB, Atacama Minerals Corp., Champion Resources Inc., South Atlantic Ventures Ltd, Tenke Mining Corp. and Valkyries Petroleum Corp.
Adolf Lundin died in 2006, aged 73, from leukemia. He is survived by his wife, Eva Wehtje, whom he married in 1957, and their four children.
