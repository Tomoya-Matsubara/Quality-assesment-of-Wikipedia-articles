Background
Gloria Estefan had wanted to record a Spanish-language album reflecting her Cuban heritage since the beginning of her musical career.1 Before recording in English, Estefan and her band performed at Latino nightclubs;2 she also remembered her grandmother teaching her old Cuban songs. Music had an important role in Estefan's family; her paternal grandmother was a poet, and an uncle played the flute in a salsa band.3 The singer's desire to record an album in Spanish was also influenced by her son, Nayib; she wanted him to recognize his Cuban heritage.4
Recording and production
Mi Tierra was produced by Estefan's husband, Emilio Estefan, and fellow Miami Sound Machine members Clay Ostwald and Jorge Casas.5 It features notable Latin musicians, including Nestor Torres, Cachao L&lt;U+00F3&gt;pez, Paquito Hechavarr&lt;U+00ED&gt;a, Paquito D'Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, Luis Enrique and Tito Puente.6 Additional performers include Sheila E. and the London Symphony Orchestra.78 The album was recorded at Crescent Moon Studios in Miami, Floria.9 Celia Cruz was invited to perform, but was unable to do so because of her touring schedule.10 The album's cover features Estefan in a black-and-white photo at a Havana nightclub before the Cuban Revolution.11
Musical style and songs
The opening track on the album, &quot;Con los A&lt;U+00F1&gt;os Que Me Quedan&quot; (&quot;With the Years I Have Left&quot;), is a Cuban bolero song. Three other bolero tracks on Mi Tierra are &quot;Mi Buen Amor&quot; (&quot;My True Love&quot;), &quot;Volver&lt;U+00E1&gt;s&quot; (&quot;You'll Be Back&quot;), and &quot;Hablas de M&lt;U+00ED&gt;&quot; (&quot;You're Talking About Me&quot;).1213 The title track details the passion of Estefan's homeland in a salsa arrangement.14 In &quot;Ayer&quot; (&quot;Yesterday&quot;) the singer finds a flower given to her by a lover and yearns for him to return, since life is short. Its music combines bolero and son music.15 &quot;No Hay Mal Que Por Bien No Bien&quot; (&quot;Out of All Bad, Some Good Things Come&quot;) is a danz&lt;U+00F3&gt;n recalling a brief love affair.16
&quot;&lt;U+00A1&gt;S&lt;U+00ED&gt; Se&lt;U+00F1&gt;or&quot; (&quot;Yes Sir!&quot;) is another son track featured on the album.17 The bolero &quot;Volver&lt;U+00E1&gt;s&quot; was later covered by Mexican recording artist Alejandro Fern&lt;U+00E1&gt;ndez on his album Me Estoy Enamorando (1997), also produced by Emilio Estefan.18 &quot;Montuno&quot; takes its name from the musical genre of the same name.19 &quot;Hablemos El Mismo Idioma&quot; (&quot;Let's Speak The Same Language&quot;) is an anthem, reaching out to other Latino groups, telling them that since they speak the same language they should leave their differences behind.20 The album closes with &quot;Tradici&lt;U+00F3&gt;n&quot; (&quot;Traditional&quot;), which is performed as a guaguanc&lt;U+00F3&gt;.21
