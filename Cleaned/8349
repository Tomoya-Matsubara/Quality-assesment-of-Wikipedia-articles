History
Melkridge lies close to the ancient course of Hadrian's Wall, one of the most significant Roman monuments in Britain. Hadrian's Wall was constructed in 122 AD. The extent of Hadrian's Wall is 117 kilometres, spanning the width of Britain; the wall incorporated Agricola's Ditch and was constructed mainly of stone in the eastern reaches4 such as at Melkridge. The wall was constructed primarily to prevent raids by small Pictish bands or unwanted immigration from the north, not as a fighting line for a major invasion.5
