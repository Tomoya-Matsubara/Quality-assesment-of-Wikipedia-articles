&quot;My Kind of Town&quot; or &quot;My Kind of Town (Chicago Is)&quot; is a popular song composed by Jimmy Van Heusen, with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.1 It was originally part of the musical score for Robin and the 7 Hoods, a 1964 musical film starring several members of the Rat Pack.2 It was nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot; from Mary Poppins.3 Although the song predated the Grammy Award Best Original Song for a Motion Picture category, the entire score was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award in the category Best Original Score Written for A Motion Picture, but it lost to the eponymously titled Mary Poppins score.4
Frank Sinatra has recorded several versions which have appeared on many of his albums. Also, many artists have performed the song as a tribute to Sinatra in posthumous tribute albums. In addition, the song had been recorded by many other artists prior to Sinatra's death. The lyrics, which praise the city of Chicago for its people and institutions, repeat the phrase My Kind of Town several times, usually in a line that says &quot;My kind of town, Chicago is&quot;.
Versions
Popularized by Sinatra, &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; was originally recorded on April 8 1964 in Los Angeles, California. The official B-side song was &quot;I Like To Lead When I Dance&quot;. The song was recorded as a 45 on Reprise Records.5 The sheet music was copyrighted and published by Sergeant Music Co., Glorste Inc. and Van Heusen Music Corp. The music is written in the key of A-flat, in 2/2 meter (known as cut time) with an allegro tempo.6
Sinatra recorded &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; twice in a studio setting, and two live versions were officially released, on Sinatra at the Sands (1966) and The Main Event &lt;U+2013&gt; Live (1974).7 One of the more famous bootleg recording is a May 22 1968 concert at the Oakland Coliseum.8 On the 1966 album Sinatra at the Sands, the song appears both as the 20th and 22nd (final) track.9 However, the final track is merely a one-minute reprise. On the 1994 album Duets II, Sinatra sings with his son, Frank Sinatra, Jr., as the 13th of 14 tracks with a length of 2:36.10
Sinatra would occasionally alter the lyrics slightly. In early version, when the Union Stock Yards (which closed in 1971) still existed, one of the final lines was &quot;The Union Stockyard, Chicago is&quot;.11 In later versions, this line is replaced with &quot;The Chicago Cubbies, Chicago is&quot;.12

It was the only time that they had two songs nominated as a team, with the other being &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; from Where Love Has Gone sung by Jack Jones.42 In addition to the winner, &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot; from Mary Poppins, other songs nominated in 1964 were &quot;Dear Heart from Dear Heart and &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; from Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte.43
