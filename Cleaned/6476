Bastards is the first studio album that Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead recorded with the short-lived Lemmy, Campbell, W&lt;U+00FC&gt;rzel and Mikkey Dee line-up. It was also the first of four Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead albums that were produced by Howard Benson. After unsuccessfully commercialising the success of 1916 with its 1992 follow up March or Die, the band returned to their roots, being loud and fast. The lyrical themes range from social criticism (&quot;On Your Feet or on Your Knees&quot;), war (&quot;Death or Glory&quot;, &quot;I am the Sword&quot;) to child abuse (&quot;Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me&quot;) and total mayhem (&quot;Burner&quot;).
&quot;Born to Raise Hell&quot; was later recorded with Ice T and Whitfield Crane and released as a single (including a version on picture disc). This version of the song was featured in the movie Airheads.1
Joe Petagno, long time Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead sleeve artist, revealed in a rare interview on the Inferno 30th Anniversary edition bonus DVD that the album was originally to be titled Devils. He had already drawn up a cover to reflect this title when it was changed.2
Sleeve artwork
As well as alluding to the original name of the album, Joe Petagno also had this insight into the concept of the album cover:
Bastards was a design I did in reply to March &lt;U+00F6&gt;r Die. That fucking horrible sleeve. It pissed me off. It was the worst thing I'd ever seen in my life. So I thought, okay, they want something like that, I'll do it properly. [I] sent it to the Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rheadbangers fan club, Alan Burridge, and he liked it so much that he put it on the cover of the fan magazine. When Lemmy saw it, he wanted it, so Devils became Bastards.3
