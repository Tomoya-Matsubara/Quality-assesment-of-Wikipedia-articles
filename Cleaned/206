__NOTOC__ 
The Daimler D.I (also known by the company designation L6) was a German fighter aircraft of World War I. It was a conventional biplane design with a very small interplane gap - the top wing nearly touched the top of the fuselage. Power was provided by a Daimler D.III engine. The L6 prototype won an Idflieg competition for a new fighter design in 1918, but only six examples were built before the end of the war.
