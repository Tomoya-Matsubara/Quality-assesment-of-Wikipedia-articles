 Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade is a series of poems by Edith Sitwell, best known as part of Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade &lt;U+2013&gt; An Entertainment in which the poems are recited over an instrumental accompaniment by William Walton. The poems and the music exist in several versions.
Sitwell began to publish some of the Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade poems in 1918, in the literary magazine Wheels. In 1922 many of them were given an orchestral accompaniment by Walton, Sitwell's prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;. The &quot;entertainment&quot; was first performed in public in 1923, and achieved both fame and notoriety for its unconventional form. Walton arranged two suites of his music for full orchestra. When Frederick Ashton made a ballet of Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade in 1931, Sitwell did not wish her poems to be part of it, and the orchestral suites were used.
After Sitwell's death, Walton published supplementary versions of Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade for speaker and small ensemble using numbers dropped between the premiere and the publication of the full score in 1951.

Sitwell's published Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade poems
It is sometimes said that the Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade verses are nonsense poetry, in the tradition of Edward Lear. This, however, is incorrect; despite the experiments with sound and rhythm, there is meaning in Sitwell's poems. The literary scholar Jack Lindsay wrote, &quot;The associations are often glancing and rapid in the extreme, but the total effect comes from a highly organized basis of sense.&quot;1 Other writers have detected personal references in the Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade poems. Christopher Palmer lists many references to Sitwell's unhappy childhood, from the kind Mariner Man (her father's valet who entertained her with sea-faring stories) to the implacable Mrs Behemoth (her mother).2
The Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade poems published by Sitwell in her 1950 collection, Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade and other Poems, 1920&lt;U+2013&gt;1935 are:

The Sitwell-Walton Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade &lt;U+2013&gt; An Entertainment
The &quot;entertainment&quot; Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade, in which Sitwell's poems are recited over an instrumental accompaniment by Walton, was first given privately in the Sitwell family's London house on 24 January 1922. The first public performance was given at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June 1923. On both occasions, the author recited the verse and the composer conducted the ensemble.3
Walton made changes to the instrumentation for the entertainment between its premiere and the publication of the first printed score nearly thirty years later,4 but in both 1922-23 and 1951 he scored for six players, some doubling on different instruments. The published score specifies flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, trumpet, percussion, and cello.5 Walton quotes a range of earlier composers in his score, from Rossini (the William Tell overture appears in the Swiss Jodelling Song) to George Grossmith (whose comic song, &quot;See me dance the polka&quot;, is present throughout Walton's Polka).6
In the Sitwell-Walton Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade there are three poems, &quot;Through Gilded Trellises,&quot; &quot;A Man from a far Country&quot; (from Sitwell's The Sleeping Beauty), and &quot;Tarantella&quot; (never formally published by Sitwell), that do not feature in her published edition of Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade. As the performing version frequently recited in public and recorded for the gramophone by Sitwell included the Tarantella, it may be assumed that she did not require the musical version to adhere strictly to the text of the published poems.
The public premiere of the entertainment was a succ&lt;U+00E8&gt;s de scandale.7 The work consisted of Sitwell's verses, which she recited through a megaphone protruding through a decorated screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music.8 The press was generally condemnatory. One contemporary headline read: &quot;Drivel That They Paid to Hear&quot;.9 The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable.10 The Manchester Guardian wrote of &quot;relentless cacophony&quot;.11 The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as &quot;harmless&quot;.12 In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: &quot;The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music &lt;U+2026&gt; which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.&quot;13 In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, &quot;as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water&quot;.14 Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and No&lt;U+00EB&gt;l Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance.15 The players did not like the work: the clarinettist asked the composer, &quot;Mr Walton, has a clarinet player ever done you an injury?&quot;16 Nevertheless, the work soon became accepted, and within a decade Walton's music was used for the popular Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade ballet, choreographed by Frederick Ashton.17
Walton revised the music continually between its first performance and the first publication of the full score in 1951. That definitive version of the Sitwell-Walton Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade consists of:  
Fanfare (Instrumental)
Hornpipe
En Famille
Mariner Man
Long Steel Grass (Trio for Two Cats and a Trombone)
Through Gilded Trellises [from The Sleeping Beauty]
Tango-Pasodoble (I do like to be beside the Seaside)
Lullaby for Jumbo
Black Mrs Behemoth
Tarantella
A Man from a far Country [from The Sleeping Beauty]
By the Lake
Country Dance
Polka
Four in the Morning
Something lies beyond the Scene
Waltz
Swiss Jodelling Song
Scotch Rhapsody
Popular Song
Fox Trot (Old Sir Faulk)
When Sir Beelzebub.
Walton's later additions

When the most comprehensive edition of the Sitwell-Walton versions was released in 1993 (on a CD featuring the voice of the Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade specialist Pamela Hunter with the Melologos ensemble) the number of poems had risen to 42. Pamela Hunter recites all these poems on the 1993 CD, including the nine for which there are no extant musical accompaniments.

Three Songs
Walton set three selections from Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade as art-songs for soprano and piano, to be sung at full voice rather than spoken rhythmically. These are:
Daphne
Through Gilded Trellises
Old Sir Faulk
Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade Suites
The first of Walton's two Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade suites for full orchestra was published in 1926. Walton conducted the first performance. The suite consists of:
Polka
Waltz
Swiss Jodelling Song
Tango-Pasodoble
Tarantella Sevillana20
The second suite was premiered in 1938, with John Barbirolli conducting the New York Philharmonic. It consists of:
Fanfare
Scotch Rhapsody
Country Dance
Noche Espagnole
Popular Song
Old Sir Faulk &lt;U+2013&gt; Foxtrot21
The orchestra for both comprises 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, trombone, tuba, timpani, 3 percussionists (side drum, cymbals, xylophone, tambourine, bass drum, triangle, glockenspiel, castanets, rattle), and strings.
Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade ballets
Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade was first made into a ballet by G&lt;U+00FC&gt;nter Hess for the German Chamber Dance Theatre in 1929. In 1931 Frederick Ashton created another ballet version. Both used the First Fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade Suite. For Ashton's version the Scotch Rhapsody and Popular Song were added to the First Suite. Ashton later expanded the ballet to include the Country Dance, Noche Espagnole and the Foxtrot, Old Sir Faulk.22
In 1972, to mark Walton's seventieth birthday, Ashton created a new ballet using the score of the &quot;entertainment&quot;. It was premiered at the Aldeburgh Festival, with Peter Pears as the reciter.23
