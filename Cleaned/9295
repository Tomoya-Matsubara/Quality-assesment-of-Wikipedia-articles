Hedva and David was an Israeli singing duo starring Hedva Amrani and David Rosenthal. In 1970, the duo won first place at the Yamaha Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, with the song I Dream of Naomi (Ani Cholem Al Naomi), which sold more than a million copies in its Japanese version, &quot;Naomi no Yume.&quot;1
Amrani recorded her first hit song in 1962 while serving in the Israeli Defense Forces. In 1965, Amrani and Rosenthal cut their first album, &quot;Tzemed Zimrei Am,&quot; which included 12 folk songs in different languages.
In the late 1970s, Amrani launched a solo career. She sang at the 87th birthday concert for Israeli President Shimon Peres. Ehud Manor wrote a song for Amrani a few weeks before he died. Amrani is married to Dudley Danoff and lives in Beverly Hills.
