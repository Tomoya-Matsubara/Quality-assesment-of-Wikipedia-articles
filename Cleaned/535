The works of J. J. Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez encompass literature and journalism, as well as UFO investigations.1 Primarily renowned as an investigator of the paranormal,2 Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez garnered attention and criticism when he released Jerusal&lt;U+00E9&gt;n, the first volume of a series named Caballo de Troya, related to the life and death of Jesus Christ. As early as 2000, he was aware that the entire series would be nine volumes.3 To write the entire series, Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez travelled to more than 15 countries and searched through about 14,000 sources.45
When asked about the material and sources he got to make the series, and the reason why he has not made them public, he commented that if he reveals such information, &quot;people will get distracted, and that's not the intention&quot;,6 also saying he does not know if he'll ever reveal them in the future. Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez confessed that searching through such information allowed him to find &quot;a new Jesus, a divine and human creature&quot;, whom he caracterized as &quot;very different of what has been told&quot;.7
Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez' main work, the Caballo de Troya series, has been heavily criticized. Several journalists have accused him of plagiarism when writing the series, such as Javier Gardu&lt;U+00F1&gt;o, who criticized The Urantia Book, and how Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez &quot;literally plagiarized&quot; pages from it to write La Rebeli&lt;U+00F3&gt;n de Lucifer.8 Another journalist, Luis Alfonso G&lt;U+00E1&gt;mez, stated that &quot;it was a shame that TVE followed the game of this deviser of mysteries,&quot; in reference to Planeta Encantado.9 Ben&lt;U+00ED&gt;tez had considered all those accusations against him to be a &quot;slander&quot;.1011
During his three decades as an author, he has published more than 50 books, including investigative reports, essays, novels and poetry, and sold more than nine million copies worldwide. As of May 2007, 7 million copies has been sold from the first 8 books of the Caballo de Troya series.12 He has also directed a TV documentary series called Planeta Encantado, in which he travels to 17 different countries in order to render his interpretation of some of the great unsolved mysteries of past history.13
