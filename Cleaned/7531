The Tab Hunter Show had a good time slot, 8:30 Eastern on Sundays, and an impressive selection of guest stars, but the episodes had the same theme and similar plots. It failed to compete effectively with CBS's The Ed Sullivan Show variety program and the western series Lawman starring John Russell and Peter Breck. The Tab Hunter Show followed National Velvet, based on a successful film of the same name on the Sunday evening schedule. It preceded The Dinah Shore Show. In 1961-1962, the entire NBC Sunday schedule was revised, with National Velvet moved to Mondays, Bonanza shifted to the Dinah Shore slot, and The Tab Hunter Show was cancelled.6
Prior to his sitcom, Hunter had appeared in such films as Damn Yankees and in such television anthology programs as Playhouse 90. The Tab Hunter Show was directed by William J. Hole, Jr. (1918-1990) and Richard Kinon.7
