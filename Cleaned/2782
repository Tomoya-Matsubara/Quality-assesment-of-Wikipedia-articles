stands at the boundary of Tokyo, Saitama, and Yamanashi Prefectures on the island of Honsh&lt;U+016B&gt;, Japan. With an elevation of , its summit is the highest point in Tokyo. It separates the Okutama Mountains and the Okuchichibu Mountains. While it marks the end of the Ishione (&lt;U+77F3&gt;&lt;U+5C3E&gt;&lt;U+6839&gt;) mountain ridge that begins near the JR Okutama Station, the highest mountain ridge in Tokyo, its remote location amongst a group of mountains from both mountain ranges makes access difficult.
Kumotori-san features an &quot;emergency&quot; hut sometimes used by hikers as overnight shelter. Hikers not used to the altitude (if coming from Tokyo) may prefer overnighting at a lower elevation. The top of Kumotori-san, in good weather, offers a splendid view of Fuji-san.
The prominence of the mountain in the region resulted in its summit being established as a fixed first-class triangulation point. As the triangulation point was established in December 1882, this was also one of the earliest ones established in Japan.
Kumotori is one of the 100 Famous Mountains of Japan.
