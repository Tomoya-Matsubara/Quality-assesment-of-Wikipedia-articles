Fuck is a 2005 American documentary film by director Steve Anderson about the word &quot;fuck&quot;. The film argues that the word is an integral part of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship. It looks at the term from perspectives which include art, linguistics, society and comedy, and begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film Perversion for Profit. Scholars and celebrities analyze conceptions of the word from differing perspectives. Sam Donaldson talks about the versatility of the word, and Billy Connolly points out it can be understood despite one's language or location. Alanis Morissette comments that the word contains power because of its taboo nature. The film features the last recorded interview of author Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide. Scholars, including linguist Reinhold Albert Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw and Jesse Sheidlower of the Oxford English Dictionary, explain the history and evolution of the word. Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg observes that the word's treatment by society reflects changes in our culture during the 20th century.
Anderson was exposed to public conceptions surrounding &quot;fuck&quot; by comedian George Carlin's monologue &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot;. He named the film Fuck despite anticipating problems with marketing. Bill Plympton animated sequences illustrating key concepts in the film. The documentary was first shown at the AFI Film Festival on November 7, 2005, at ArcLight Hollywood in Hollywood, California.
Fuck's reviews were mixed. A. O. Scott called the film a battle between advocates of morality and supporters of freedom of expression. The Washington Post and the New York Daily News criticized its length and repetitiveness. In his 2009 book Fuck, law professor Christopher M. Fairman called the movie &quot;the most important film using 'fuck'&quot;.1 The American Film Institute said &quot;Ultimately, Fuck is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay.&quot;2
Content summary
 Fuck begins with a segment from the 1965 propaganda film, Perversion for Profit,34 followed by a clip from SpongeBob SquarePants which notes that the word can be used as a &quot;sentence enhancer&quot;.5 The documentary includes commentary from Kevin Smith, Steven Bochco, Janeane Garofalo, Chuck D, Ron Jeremy, Bill Maher, Michael Medved, Alan Keyes, Judith Martin, Drew Carey, Alanis Morissette, Ice T, Pat Boone and Billy Connolly.678 The word &quot;fuck&quot; is used 857 times during the film.910
 Scholarly analysis is provided by Maledicta publisher Reinhold Albert Aman, journalism analyst David Shaw1112 and Jesse Sheidlower of the Oxford English Dictionary.131415 Language professor Geoffrey Nunberg notes, &quot;You could think of that [word] as standing in for most of the changes that happened in the 20th century, at least many of the important ones&quot;.16
The film next features Hunter S. Thompson, in his final documented interview.17 Fuck later includes archival footage of Lenny Bruce and George Carlin and analysis of the word's use in popular culture, from MASH (1970) to Scarface (1983) and Clerks (1994).18 Carlin's 1972 monologue, &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot;, is excerpted in the film.19
Journalist Sam Donaldson comments on the versatility of &quot;fuck&quot;: &quot;It's one of those all-purpose words.&quot;20 Bill Maher notes, &quot;It's the ultimate bad word&quot;,21 observing that thanks to Lenny Bruce, comedy clubs have become &quot;the freest free-speech zone&quot; in the United States.22
Comedian Billy Connolly points out that &quot;fuck&quot; &quot;sounds exactly like what it is&quot;,23 noting that the emotional impact of saying &quot;fuck off&quot; cannot be translated.2425 He says that if you are in Lhasa airport and someone is fiddling with your luggage, yelling &quot;fuck off&quot; will effectively communicate that they should stop and leave.26 Alanis Morissette says, &quot;The f-word is special. Everybody uses the word 'breakfast', but not everyone feels comfortable using the word 'fuck' so there's an extra power behind it.&quot;27
Boone argues for less use of the word, saying that he uses his own name (&quot;Boone&quot;) in its place.2829 Dennis Prager says that it is acceptable for youths to hear the word on television and film, but not from their family members.30 In the film, opponents of the word &quot;fuck&quot; use an argument commonly known as &quot;Think of the children&quot;.31
Fuck points out that the original use of the word is unknown to scholars,32 noting that its earliest written appearance was in the 1475 poem &quot;Flen Flyys&quot;.3334 The film dispels the myth that the word was originally an acronym for &quot;For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge&quot; or &quot;Fornication Under Consent of the King&quot;.353637
The word has been used by authors including Robert Burns, D.H. Lawrence (in his 1928 Lady Chatterley's Lover) and James Joyce.3839 The film explains that &quot;fuck&quot; established its current usage during World Wars I and II,40 and was used by General George S. Patton in a speech to his forces who were about to enter France.4142
Fuck notes that the first use of the word in a large-studio film was in M*A*S*H (1970),4344 and it entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972.45 That year, the word was also recorded during the Apollo 16 United States mission to land on the Moon.46 The film includes a segment from the 1987 film Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with actor Steve Martin, in which &quot;fuck&quot; is repeated for comedic effect.47 Fuck points out the suggestive title of the 2004 film Meet the Fockers, the most financially successful live action comedy film to date.48
The director analyzes the uses and connotations of &quot;fuck&quot;, and the feelings it evokes on several levels.49 Lenny Bruce is quoted as saying, &quot;If you can't say 'fuck', you can't say 'fuck the government'&quot;.50 Steve Anderson argues that &quot;fuck&quot; is an integral part of societal discussions about freedom of speech and censorship.515253
Soundtrack
Fuck includes songs with similarly themed titles, including &quot;Shut Up and Fuck&quot; by Betty Blowtorch, &quot;Fucking Fucking Fuck&quot; by Splatpattern and &quot;I Love to Say Fuck&quot; by Murderdolls.54 Sam Peczek of Culture Wars compared the film's music to that in softcore pornography,55 and noted that the soundtrack was broad in scope and helped accentuate the film's content.56
Track listing
Production
Inspiration
 Steve Anderson made his directorial debut in 2003 with the film The Big Empty, starring Daryl Hannah and Jon Favreau,5758 and became fascinated by the usage of &quot;fuck&quot;.59 In an interview with the Democrat and Chronicle, Anderson suggested he cursed a lot more than he used to after the film's production.60 He explained that he decided to research the film's topic due to the word &quot;fuck&quot;{{'}}s versatility and his interest in language use as a writer.61 Early exposure by Anderson to public conceptions of the word &quot;fuck&quot; came from Class Clown by comedian George Carlin, which included his monologue &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot;.6263
The director explained in an interview that he was fascinated with the word &quot;fuck&quot; because of its different uses.64 He originally proposed the idea of a film about the word in jest, later realizing that the topic could fuel a documentary.65 The Observer quoted him as saying that he was entertained by the word &quot;fuck&quot;,66 and intrigued with the idea of examining how the word had been incorporated into popular culture.67 He wanted to analyze why some people were offended by its use and others enjoyed it, noting that the word sharpened debate about taboo language in society.68
Anderson explained to the Los Angeles Times the confusing, forbidden nature of the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the face of the increased pervasiveness of euphemisms for it.69 He noted its taboo nature and demonstrated how it can be indirectly referred to, so youth understand the reference without using the word itself.70 In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Anderson said that film directors should fight against censorship, because it can block their true message.71
The director told CanWest News Service that he hoped the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use.72 Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on NYPD Blue, and how parents should discuss its use with their children.73 He emphasized that artists and filmmakers should be free to express their views without censorship,74 deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.75
Anderson noted in an interview with IndieWire that freedom of speech was not guaranteed, but a concept requiring discussion and monitoring so it is not lost.76 He classified the word &quot;fuck&quot; as being at the core of discussion about freedom of speech.77 He acknowledged that there are terms considered by society more vulgar than &quot;fuck&quot;, but said that this particular word creates controversy and dialogue.78 Anderson said that its title alone distinguished his documentary from others, in terms of promotional difficulty.79 During production, Fuck was known as The Untitled F-Word Film.80
Title and marketing
 In an interview about the film on his website, Anderson discussed his problems when he decided to name his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word.81 He said he always wanted to call the documentary Fuck, because it succinctly described the film's contents.82 There were inherent problems with this approach, including an inability to advertise the film with its true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times (they used four asterisks instead), although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers like LA Weekly.8384 Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film's title during film festivals on theatre marquees.85
Anderson explained that although the title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk.86 The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions.87 He concluded that his struggle reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title.88 Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.89
Filming and distribution
 The film features animation by Bill Plympton.9091 To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage;92 Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and 22 films in the documentary.93 The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear to be talking to each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject.9495 The film was unrated by the Motion Picture Association of America.9697
Rainstorm Entertainment was confirmed in November 2003 to produce and finance the documentary, with production scheduled to begin in January 2004.98 The film was completed in 2005 by Anderson's company, Mudflap Films, and produced by Rainstorm Entertainment co-founders Steven Kaplan and Gregg Daniel,99 and Bruce Leiserowitz, Jory Weitz and Richard Ardi.100 Financial assistance was provided by Bad Apple Films of Spokane, Washington.101
 Thirty-five media commentators were interviewed for the film.102103 Jory Weitz helped obtain interviews; he had cast Anderson's previous film, The Big Empty, and had industry credibility as executive producer of Napoleon Dynamite.104 Anderson said he intended to select interviewees with a variety of perspectives, conservative as well as liberal.105 He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone was among the first to confirm his participation.106 Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck.107 After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees.108 The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide,109 and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.110
Distribution rights to Fuck were obtained by THINKFilm in 2006.111112 Movie chains did not use the film's title in their promotion, instead using references such as The Four-Letter Word Film.113 Mark Urman, chief of the theatrical division of THINKFilm, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that it was especially difficult (as an independent film distributor) to promote a film with a title media outlets did not wish to print.114 Urman told Variety that the intent of the production staff during promotion was a creative, original marketing campaign.115 THINKFilm marketed the documentary as a comprehensive, humorous look at the dichotomy between the taboo nature and cultural universality of the word &quot;fuck&quot;.116

Critical response
 Fuck received mixed reviews. Review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an overall 56 percent approval rating (based on 72 reviews), with an average rating of 5.8 out of 10.135 The site consensus is that the film is &quot;a documentary that sets out to explore a lingual taboo but can't escape its own naughty posturing&quot;.136 At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted-mean rating from 0&lt;U+2013&gt;100 reviews by film critics, the film has a rating score of 58 based on 23 reviews (a mixed, or average, film).137 The American Film Institute wrote, &quot;Ultimately, Fuck is a movie about free speech ... Freedom of expression must extend to words that offend. Love it or hate it, fuck is here to stay&quot;.138
Jack Garner of the Democrat and Chronicle gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, concluding that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value.139 He described it as educational, despite Fuck{{'}}s repetitive use of the word.140 In The Boston Globe Wesley Morris noted that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience.141 Sally Foster of Film Threat said that the crux of the film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking.142 A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: &quot;Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word &lt;U+2014&gt; its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix' &lt;U+2014&gt; rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane&quot;.143 In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word.144 According to Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald, the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.145
In a review for The Austin Chronicle Marjorie Baumgarten gave the film a rating of 4.5 out of five stars, concluding that it helped unravel myths surrounding the word and describing it as captivating and educational.146 Steve Schneider reviewed the film for the Orlando Weekly, comparing it to an academic thesis despite its repeated use of off-color humor.147 Noel Murray of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade of B-minus,148 stating that Fuck succeeded where Kirby Dick's This Film Is Not Yet Rated did not, by providing viewpoints from multiple perspectives.149 Karl French wrote in a review for The Financial Times that the documentary was unique and reasonably entertaining.150 Moira MacDonald asked, in a review for The Seattle Times, if viewers could embrace the First Amendment and still be leery of the word's omnipresence in society.151 Mick LaSalle wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that the commentators seemed monotonous and formulaic in debating freedom of speech, and criticized the film's repetition of the word &quot;fuck&quot;.152
Peter Keough reviewed the film for the Boston Phoenix; giving it a rating of two out of four stars, he also said that the repeated use of &quot;fuck&quot; grew tiresome.153 In a critical review for The Observer Philip French wrote that the film had low comedic value, calling it arrogant, puerile and tedious.154 Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film two out of five stars, criticizing its lack of originality.155 In a review for Empire Magazine, David Parkinson also gave the film a rating of two out of five stars and was frustrated that arguments by the director seemed guarded;156 he said that the film's scope was not comedic, amusing or provoking enough.157 In Time Out London David Jenkins gave the film one star out of six, writing that it lacked depth on the issues of linguistics, media, and censorship.158 A critical review by Noah Sanders of The Stranger concluded that the film was watchable and amusing, but poorly edited and organized.159 The St. Paul Pioneer Press criticized the film's length,160 which was echoed by The Washington Post,161 the Deseret News,162 The Herald163 and the New York Daily News.164 In a review for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Bill White gave the film a grade C, calling it a dull compilation of childish observations and a failed attempt to spark a discussion about freedom of speech.165 Mike Pinksy of DVD Verdict concluded that the film's main arguments were achieved by the beginning of the documentary, and criticized its lack of subsequent structure and light tone overall.166

Impact
Fuck has been a resource for several university courses. Christopher M. Fairman discussed the documentary in his article, &quot;Fuck&quot;, published in February 2007 in the Cardozo Law Review.180 Fairman cited Anderson's decision to call his film Fuck and the marketing problems this entailed,181 saying that he and Anderson both found the title of their works helped spur debate on word taboos in society.182
In an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent, Anderson said that a schoolteacher in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had been fired for showing the documentary to his students.183 The teacher had researched the documentary, and wanted to teach his students the history of the word because of its frequent use in his class.184 Anderson said it was not the use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the film that cost the teacher his job, but a 38-second scene from a Fuck for Forest concert in Europe where a couple engaged in sexual intercourse onstage as environmental advocacy.185 The teacher showed the DVD to his 11th-grade journalism class at William Penn High School without previewing it or sending permission slips home to parents.186 He told the Philadelphia Daily News that before showing the documentary, he was unaware that it contained the clip showing sexual intercourse.187 He was dismissed from his position by the school principal, and his termination was upheld by the regional superintendent.188 The teacher did not appeal the decision, instead retiring.189 An analysis of the incident by the Philadelphia Daily News concluded that the school district's decision to fire the teacher was appropriate, but also agreed with the teacher's position that showing a 90-minute DVD should not have obliterated his 19 years as an educator.190
Fuck was featured in a 2012 analysis in the academic journal Communication Teacher, &quot;Do You Talk to Your Teacher with That Mouth? F*ck: A Documentary and Profanity as a Teaching Tool in the Communication Classroom&quot;, by Miriam Sobre-Denton of Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Jana Simonis.191 Sobre-Denton and Simonis discussed the documentary's use for communication studies students studying university-level intercultural relations.192 Their research incorporated interviews with Steve Anderson, students and data from graduate-level classes in language and culture.193 Sobre-Denton and Simonis' conclusions correlated taboo words with social forms of power, rebelliousness, professionalism and gender roles.194
