Zbigniew (b. ca. 10731 &lt;U+2014&gt; d. 8 July 1113?2), Duke of Poland (in Greater Poland, Kuyavia and Masovia) from 1102 until 1107.
Life
Early years
Zbigniew was the first-born son of Prince W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I Herman and Przec&lt;U+0142&gt;awa, who apparently belonged to the Prawdzic clan.34 The actual status of Zbigniew's mother has been a matter of dispute among historians: some believe that she was only W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw's mistress while others assert that they were married but only under pagan rituals and, in consequence, the union wasn't recognized by the Church as a valid marriage.56 Whatever the case, Zbigniew was raised at his father's court enjoying all his respects.7
Prince W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw assumed the Polish throne in 1079 after the deposition of his older brother Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw II the Bold. In 1080, as Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I, he married the Bohemian princess Judith, daughter of Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia. Soon after Przec&lt;U+0142&gt;awa was sent away; according to some sources, she took the veil and died around 1092.89
The apparent barrenness of the Duchess encouraged Zbigniew's expectations to succeeded his father despite his illegitimacy. However in 1085, likely due to the pressure of the barons, Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I recalled Mieszko Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;awowic the only son of the deposed Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw II from his exile in Hungary.10 Young prince Mieszko accepted the overlordship of his uncle and gave up his hereditary claims in exchange for becoming first in line of succession; in addition, he received the district of Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w.11
Removal of Zbigniew's hereditary rights
In 1086, and after six years of marriage, Duchess Judith gave birth a son, the future Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III Wrymouth. This event changed Zbigniew's situation drastically.
Now with a legitimate son and heir, both Zbigniew's and Mieszko's positions were threatened by Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I. In the case of Mieszko, he was forced to accept the situation due to the popularity of the latter among the nobility; however, in 1089 the Mieszko died under mysterious circumstances, probably by poisoning.12
Zbigniew began his studies with the intention of entering an ecclesiastical career. In 1086 he was named Canon of Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w,rna, P. Wierzbicki p. 499&quot;/&gt; where he studied under the tutelage of his paternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess Maria Dobroniega.13 Zbigniew, however, was still too young to be ordained a priest.14
In 1089 Zbigniew's father, after the death of his Bohemian wife, married again with Judith of Swabia renamed Sophia, sister of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor and widow of the ex-King Solomon of Hungary. The relationship between the new Duchess and her stepsons was cold, especially with the first-born Zbigniew. It's thanks to her intrigues that in 1089, W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I sent Zbigniew to Saxony,15 and placed him in the Quedlinburg Abbey, where the Abbess was Judith-Sophia's sister, Adelaide.16 This actions showed the Duke's efforts to get rid of Zbigniew, making him a monk and ineligible for the succession1718 and, after Mieszko's death, this two events allowed Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I to eliminate the two pretenders to the Polish throne, protect the heritage of his legitimate son Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw and undermine the growing opposition against his rule.19
Usurpation of Sieciech
During his stay in Quedlinburg, Zbigniew's father fell into dependence on his supporter, Count Palatine Sieciech. He is probably owed his elevation to the throne.20 Sieciech was the first guardian of the minor prince Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw. In his plans to seize power over the country, the Count Palatine gained the support of Duchess Judith-Sophia.21
In 1090 Sieciech, with help of Polish forces under his command, managed to gain control over Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, the rest were burned, in order to thwart any future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the region&lt;U+2019&gt;s independence from Poland.22 The following year, an attempt to recover the domain of Gda&lt;U+0144&gt;sk Pomerania was unsuccessfully.23  At that time, Poland politics were involved in the Russian case. The Rostislavich line not recognize the Polish sovereignty, leading hostile politics (especially Prince Vasilko of Terebovlia, who was allied with the Cumans) and invading the country.24 Sieciech became then in the undisputed ruler of the country, and made his own coin. In the absence of a ruler, he held the highest military functions in the country. Also, he give the highest court dignities to his supporters.2526 The main objectives of Sieciech were simple: ambition, lust for power and desire to enrich himself. To achieve them, the Count Palatine was able to use violent means.ski p. 30&quot;/&gt; After Sieciech repressive actions, there has been a massive political emigration from the Polish territories to Bohemia.
Return. Act of Legitimization
The tiranical rule of the Count Palatine soon turn against him. In 1093, a group of powerful Silesian lords kidnapped Zbigniew from Quedlinburg and brought back to Poland.27 Firstly, Zbigniew found shelter at the side of Magnus, Castellan of Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw. Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I considered this an open rebellion. The Hungarian nobility also supported Zbigniew and give meals to the rebels; also, they kidnapped both Sieciech and Prince Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw. This behavior forced the Duke to recognized Zbigniew as the rightful successor to the throne.
In 1093, Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I issued an Act of Legitimization under which he recognized Zbigniew as his son and member of the Piast dynasty; also, was given to him the right to succeed to the throne. Following Sieciech and Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw&lt;U+2019&gt;s escape from Hungary an expedition against Zbigniew was mounted by the Count Palatine. Its aim was to nullify the Act of Legitimization. The contestants met at the Battle of Goplo in 1096, where Sieciech&lt;U+2019&gt;s forces completely defeated the supporters of Zbigniew, who was taken captured and imprisoned; however, he regained his freedom a year later (1 May 1097) due to the intervention of the bishops.2829 At the same time his rights guaranteed by the Act of Legitimization were returned to him.30
The plans of Sieciech and Duchess Judith-Sophia to take the complete control over the country were discovered by Zbigniew; his young half-brother Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw became in his ally. In 1098, both princes prevailed on their father to give them separate provinces. The Duke was forced to accept and made the formal division of his domains.31 Zbigniew received Greater Poland (included Gniezno), Kuyavia, &lt;U+0141&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;czyca Land and Sieradz Land; Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw obtained Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land.32 Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I kept control of Masovia and its capital at Plock; also, could retained control of the most important cities i.e. Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw, Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w and Sandomierz.3334
Defeat and Exile of Sieciech
The division of the country greatly alarmed the Count Palatine, who feared that the disminution of his master's power could undermine his own situation.35 He then began preparations for a military settlement of the issue and gained the Duke&lt;U+2019&gt;s support for it. The position of Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I was strange because he chose to support Sieciech&lt;U+2019&gt;s cause instead of his own sons.36 After hear of the expedition, Zbigniew and Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw renewed their alliance, who took place at the Wiec organized in Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw by the magnate Skarbmir. There it was decided to remove the current guardian of Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw, a noble named Wojslaw (a Sieciech's relative) and arrange an expedition against the Count Palatine. Subsequently in 1099 the troops of both Sieciech and Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I faced with the forces of Zbigniew and Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw near Zarnowiec by the river Pilica. The rebel forces were victorious and the humilliated Duke was obliged to permanently remove Sieciech from the position of Count Palatine.
A few months later, the opposition forces have been directed towards Sieciech&lt;U+00F3&gt;w,37 where the former Count Palatine was hidden. Surprisingly, Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I, with a few branches come to the aid of Sieciech. In this situation, the princes decided the deposition of their father. Zbigniew marched against Masovia, where he was to take control of P&lt;U+0142&gt;ock, while Bo&lt;U+0142&gt;eslaw was directed to the South. The intention of the two brothers, was the encirclement of Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I; however, he could predicted the maneuver and could sent back his forces to Masovia. The definitive conflict between both forces took place near P&lt;U+0142&gt;ock. Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I was completely defeated and was forced to exile Sieciech from the country.38 The ex-Count Palatine left Poland around 1100/1101. Is known that he took refuge in German lands. However, is known that he eventually returned to Poland after several years of exile, but didn't play any political role again. He may have been blinded. Duke W&lt;U+0142&gt;adys&lt;U+0142&gt;aw I died on 4 June 1102.&lt;ref name = &quot;PJasienica117&quot; 39
Duke of Poland
Struggle for the supremacy (1102-1106)
After their father's death, the division of the country between Zbigniew and Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III was maintained almost exactly as was done in 1098, with the exception that Zbigniew received Masovia (with P&lt;U+0142&gt;ock) and Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III obtain Sandomierz from the late Duke's domains. However, soon arose disputes between the brothers; it's probable that the main reason was the fact that Zbigniew, as the oldest, considered himself as the Senior Duke,&lt;ref name= &quot;Szczur121&quot; 4041 a right who was recognized to him by the Polish society.&lt;ref name = &quot;RGrodecki135&quot; 42
The two states created after the division were virtually separated. Both Dukes maintain different internal and foreign politics, and this caused that some times the brothers were enemies. The case of Pomerania proved to a delicate matter. Zbigniew was a strong opponent of Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III anti-Pomeranian politics and wanted to keep good relations with the northern neighbor. With one of the first organized expeditions to Pomerania by Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III he managed to convinced the knights to turn back and return home, which caused the fury of the Junior Duke.43 This situation didn't last long, because even following months the booty-hungry knights sided with Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III, made some military expeditions to Pomerania and Prussia.44
Pomeranians retaliatory military actions, however, were directed against Zbigniew. The latter has established closer contacts with Bohemia, and wanted to exert pressure over Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III and in this way obtain his definitive withdrawal from the Pomeranian affairs. The Junior Duke, by the other hand, strengthened his position through contacts with Hungary and Kievan Rus. The marriage of Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III with Princess Zbys&lt;U+0142&gt;awa (ca. 1103), daughter of Grand Prince Sviatopolk II of Kiev sealed his alliance with Kievan Rus.45 Zbigniew see in this marriage and alliance with the Kievan ruler a directed attack against him; then he began his attempts to persuade Duke Borivoj II of Bohemia to invaded Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III's domains.46 Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III, in response to this actions ravaged the Pomeranian border during 1104-1105. These expeditions brought a valuable loot and effectively ended the previous alliance of Zbigniew with the Pomeranians.&lt;ref name = &quot;MSp&lt;U+00F3&gt;rna62&quot; 47
In 1105 Zbigniew made an agreement with his brother,rna62&quot;/&gt; under which both princes regarded a reciprocal compromise in matters of foreign policy; howeer, and despite further attempts to ended the matter (Tyniec Accord), the case of Pomerania remained unresolved.48 In 1106, with the help of his Kievan and Hungarian allies, Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III attacked Zbigniew&lt;U+2019&gt;s territory. The combined forces could take without much problems Kalisz, Gniezno, Spycimierz and Leczyca,&lt;ref name = &quot;RGrodecki137&quot; 49 occupying half of the Senior Duke's domains. Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III also captured the ally of his older brother, Archbishop of Gniezno, Martin I.&lt;ref name = &quot;MSp&lt;U+00F3&gt;rna500&quot; 50 Through the Bishop of Krak&lt;U+00F3&gt;w, Baldwin, came to a settlement in &lt;U+0141&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;czyca,&lt;ref name = &quot;SSzczur122&quot; 51 where Zbigniew officially recognized Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III as the High Duke of all Poland, and was forced to surrendering to him Greater Poland, Kuyavia, &lt;U+0141&gt;&lt;U+0119&gt;czyca and Sieradz Land.rna500&quot;/&gt; Zbigniew could retain Masovia, but only as a fief.52
Deposition and Exile
Zbigniew never accepted the overlordship of his younger half-brother; this was noted when he didn't fulfilled his duties as a vassal by refusing to burn the fortress of Kur&lt;U+00F3&gt;w in Pu&lt;U+0142&gt;awy53 and to provide military to Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III in a campaign against the Pomeranians in the winter of 1107-1108.
Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III, with the help of his Kievan and Hungarian allies, began a final campaign to rid himself of Zbigniew. Their forces attacked Masovia, and quickly forced Zbigniew to surrender. As a punishment, the deposed Duke was banished from the country. From then Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III was the sole lord of the Polish lands.5455 However, it's seems that the transfer of power to Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III took place in early 1107, when Zbigniew still was in Masovia as a vassal.56
Second Return to Poland
Claims against Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III
 Zbigniew took refuge firstly in Pomerania and Bohemia; later, he went to the court of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry V.
In the meanwhile, Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III attacked Bohemia (1108); thanks to this expedition, the planned German-Bohemian attack against Hungary failed.rna500&quot;/&gt; In response to the aggressive politics of the Polish ruler, the Emperor made a retaliatory expedition against Poland with the support of Bohemian warriors (Polish-German War). As a pretext to this actions, Henry V declared his support to the exiled Zbigniew, who never gave up to his pretentions and wanted to regain his lost territories. The German ruler set an ultimatum to Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III, under which he demanded in exchange for the abandonment of the expedition half of the Polish state to Zbigniew, the recognition of the sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire, and the regular payment of 300 fine silver per year as a tribute, or provide 300 knights for military expeditions.rna500&quot;/&gt;57
Hostilities began in Silesian territory. The Imperial troops faced the strong resistance of the defenders of Bytom Odrza&lt;U+0144&gt;ski, G&lt;U+0142&gt;og&lt;U+00F3&gt;w, and Wroc&lt;U+0142&gt;aw, whose apogee was the heroic defense of G&lt;U+0142&gt;og&lt;U+00F3&gt;w (Battle of G&lt;U+0142&gt;og&lt;U+00F3&gt;w, 14 August 1109). Thanks to this heroic defense of the Silesian castles, Henry V failed to obtain the victory. Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III continue the resistance and gradually began to show positive results. Ultimately, King Henry V retired to Silesia (Battle of Hundsfeld, 24 August 1109). It's worth noting the participation of villagers in defending the castles; this actions showed the first traces of the Polish nationalism.58 Zbigniew escape to Bohemia.
Blinding and Death
 Since his exile in Bohemia, Zbigniew arranged armed robbery in Silesia. This finally caused a retaliatory expedition against Bohemia by Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III (1110). Despite the massacre of Bohemian warriors, the Polish ruler failed to settle his pretender Sob&lt;U+011B&gt;slav in the throne of Bohemia.
In 1111 a truce was concluded between the Duke Vladislav I of Bohemia and Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III. Under the terms of this agreement was made an specific transaction: the Bohemian ruler allowed to return home to prince Sob&lt;U+011B&gt;slav, and the Polish Duke obtain the return of Zbigniew to Poland. Zbigniew was received back in Poland and furnished with a grant (probably Sieradz);59 but, according to Gallus Anonymus, he maintain his arrogance and caused the anger of his brother, who committed an act who regret forever; however, the chronicle Cosmas of Prague, stated that the punishment of Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III was calculated:
&quot;three days after his brother Zbigniew made the oath of fidelity was called with tricks and deprived of his eyes.&quot;60
For this crime, Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Gniezno, Martin I, whom remained as a strong supporter of Zbigniew.61 According to Gallus Anonymus, the Polish ruler held after repentance, received a pardon from his brother Zbigniew.62
About Zbigniew's death nothing is known. An interesting reference contains an obituary of the Benedictine monastery in Lubin. On 8 July 1113, is recorded in it the death of a monk of Tyniec Abbey, brother Zbigniew. This obituary served to historians to propose the hypothesis that he was Boles&lt;U+0142&gt;aw III's brother. The place of burial is marked there as Benedictine monastery in Tyniec.63
