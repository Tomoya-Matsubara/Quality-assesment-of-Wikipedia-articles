New York State Route 321 is a minor thoroughfare in the county of Onondaga. It begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 in the village of Skaneateles. The highway heads to the north and to the east, intersecting with County Route 107 in the outlying town of Skaneateles. Route 321 intersects with Forward Road and becomes concurrent with County Route 66 (Bennetts Corners Road). The state designation terminates at an intersection with New York State Route 5 in Bennetts Corners, where Route 66 continues northward to Memphis.
Route 321 dates back to the 1920s as New York State Route 26. The designation was changed to 321 along part of Route 26 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering.
Route description
Route 321 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 20 (West Genesee Street) in the Onondaga County village of Skaneateles.1 The highway, at first, heads northward, intersecting with local streets in the village. After leaving the village and entering the town of the same name, the highway intersects with the Old Seneca Turnpike (CR 133). Route 321 continues northward, intersecting with several county routes, including Halfway Road (CR 107; former NY 368) south of the Elbridge hamlet of Halfway. Soon afterwards, Route 321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY 5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY 931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon after the turn.2
Past Forward Road, Route 321 becomes concurrent with County Route 66 as maintenance of the roadway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to Onondaga County. The state designation comes to an end at Route 5 in the hamlet of Bennetts Corners west of the village of Camillus shortly after; however, CR 66 continues onward.3
County Route 66 continues through farmlands of central New York and passes to the west of Camillus Country Club and its service road. It turns to the northeast as it continues towards Memphis. CR 66 intersects with local roads in the hamlet of Oswego Bitter before terminating at CR 67 and CR 134 in the hamlet of Memphis.4
History
 When state highways in New York were first signed in 1924, what is now NY 321 south of Forward Road, as well as Forward Road itself, was designated as part of NY 26, a north-south highway connecting Ithaca to Syracuse.5 In the 1930 renumbering, the segment of NY 26 between U.S. Route 20 in Skaneateles and modern NY 174 south of Camillus was renumbered to NY 321.6 Between 1948 and 1952, the portion of then-NY 321 south of Forward Road was also designated as part of NY 20SY, a largely alternate routing of U.S. Route 20 between Skaneateles and Manlius via Syracuse.78 Past Sweets Corners, NY 20SY continued north on a previously unnumbered roadway to NY 5 at Bennetts Corners, where it joined NY 5 east into Camillus.9
In 1962, NY 20SY was removed from the state highway system, leaving only NY 321 in place once again from Skaneateles to Sweets Corners.1011 Between Sweets Corners and Bennetts Corners, the former routing of NY 20SY was redesignated as the southernmost portion of County Route 66.12 NY 321 was eventually rerouted in the 1980s to overlap CR 66 north to a new terminus at NY 5.1314 The former routing of NY 321 on Forward Road is still maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation as New York State Route 931F, an unsigned reference route.15
