The limited edition did not feature the song, &quot;You&quot;.
With the release of this album, KAT-TUN became the first artist in Japanese music history to have all of their collective releases (three singles, two albums, and five DVDs at the time) reach number 1 on the charts.1 The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan.2 KAT-TUN went on a seven-city nationwide tour from April 3 2007 to June 17 2007 in support of the album. The last performance at Tokyo Dome was filmed and released on DVD entitled &quot;Tour 2007 Cartoon KAT-TUN II You&quot; on November 21 2007.3
Album information
The album's title is similarly named to the group's late-night talk show, Cartoon KAT-TUN, which began airing two weeks before the album's release on NTV. The album was recorded in Tokyo and Bennett Studios in Englewood, New Jersey. Songwriters who presided over the group's debut album also contributed several tracks to the record. ma-saya who worked with KAT-TUN before penned their second single, &quot;SIGNAL&quot;, and the third track, &quot;Splash...&quot;. Kazumasa Oda, folk singer-songwriter formerly of Off Course, wrote their third single, &quot;Bokura no Machi de&quot;, a tender love ballad. Yoji Kubota, a prolific lyricist for many of Japan's contemporary pop artists, wrote &quot;Movin on...&quot; with arranger Nao Tanaka and also penned &quot;Heartbreak Club&quot;. The group's senpai, Takizawa Hideaki of Tackey &amp; Tsubasa, composed the music for &quot;My Angel, You are Angel&quot;.4 All tracks from the bonus CD are songs KAT-TUN had been performing in concerts and Sh&lt;U+014D&gt;nen Club since their junior days. The second track, &quot;Peak&quot;, was used in a commercial for NTT DoCoMo's 903iTV series of cellphones which Kazuya Kamenashi starred in.
KAT-TUN members also received a solo track each which they co-wrote themselves, with the exception of Kazuya Kamenashi and Junnosuke Taguchi. The fourteenth track, &quot;You&quot;, was not officially released as a single but a music video was shot marking Jin Akanishi's return to the group. The song also served as a theme song to Kamenashi's drama, Suppli.5 All rap lyrics featured in the album were also written by Koki Tanaka himself; he also co-wrote his rap verses in &quot;Fight All Night&quot; with Tomohisa Yamashita of NEWS and with bandmate Yuichi Nakamaru for &quot;No Matter Matter&quot;.6
Chart performance and reception
In its first week of release, Cartoon KAT-TUN II You sold 270,976 copies in Japan, a sharp drop from the first-week sales of their debut album. Despite the stark difference in reported sales, the album's two singles which had been released months in advance had seen more than 1 million shipments altogether before the album's release in April 2007. The album's first week numbers were enough to grab the number 1 spot on the Oricon album charts, however, and it stayed on the charts for another 3 weeks before dropping off the top 30. The album has sold more than 354,973 copies to date and was certified as the 30th best-selling album of 2007 by Oricon at the end of the year.
KAT-TUN also won six awards at the 21st Japan Gold Disc Awards with &quot;SIGNAL&quot; and &quot;Bokura no Machi de&quot; placing on the &quot;The Best 10 Singles (Domestic)&quot; list.7
