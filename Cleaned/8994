Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about , with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.
 Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are 95-100% certain that it is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.123 These findings are recognized by the national science academies of all major industrialized nations.4
Climate model projections were summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). They indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further  for their lowest emissions scenario and  for their highest.5 The ranges of these estimates arise from the use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.67
Future climate change and associated impacts8 will vary from region to region around the globe.9 The effects of an increase in global temperature include a rise in sea levels and a change in the amount and pattern of precipitation, as well as a probable expansion of subtropical deserts.10 Warming is expected to be strongest in the Arctic, with the continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice. Other likely effects of the warming include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves, droughts and heavy rainfall; ocean acidification; and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes. Effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the loss of habitat from inundation.1112
Proposed policy responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction, adaptation to its effects, and possible future geoengineering. Most countries are parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),13 whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) climate change.14 Parties to the UNFCCC have adopted a range of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions15161718 and to assist in adaptation to global warming.19202122 Parties to the UNFCCC have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required,23 and that future global warming should be limited to below  relative to the pre-industrial level.24 Reports published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme25 and the International Energy Agency26 suggest that efforts as of the early 21st century to reduce emissions may be inadequate to meet the UNFCCC's  target.
Observed temperature changes
   The Earth's average surface temperature rose by  over the period 1906&lt;U+2013&gt;2005. The rate of warming over the last half of that period was almost double that for the period as a whole ( per decade, versus  per decade). The urban heat island effect is very small, estimated to account for less than  of warming per decade since 1900.27 Temperatures in the lower troposphere have increased between 0.13 and  (0.22 and ) per decade since 1979, according to satellite temperature measurements. Climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850, with regionally varying fluctuations such as the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age.28
The warming that is evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations, as documented by many independent scientific groups.29 Examples include sea level rise (water expands as it warms),30 widespread melting of snow and ice,31 increased heat content of the oceans,32 increased humidity,33 and the earlier timing of spring events,34 e.g., the flowering of plants.35 The probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero.36
Recent estimates by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the National Climatic Data Center show that 2005 and 2010 tied for the planet's warmest year since reliable, widespread instrumental measurements became available in the late 19th century, exceeding 1998 by a few hundredths of a degree.373839 Estimates by the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) show 2005 as the second warmest year, behind 1998 with 2003 and 2010 tied for third warmest year, however, &quot;the error estimate for individual years ... is at least ten times larger than the differences between these three years.&quot;40 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) statement on the status of the global climate in 2010 explains that, &quot;The 2010 nominal value of  ranks just ahead of those of 2005 () and 1998 (), although the differences between the three years are not statistically significant...&quot;41 Every year from 1986 to 2012 has seen world annual mean temperatures above the 1961-1990 average.4243
Temperatures in 1998 were unusually warm because global temperatures are affected by the El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the strongest El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o in the past century occurred during that year.44 Global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long term trends and can temporarily mask them. The relative stability in temperature from 2002 to 2009 is consistent with such an episode.4546 2010 was also an El Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;o year. On the low swing of the oscillation, 2011 as a La Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;a year was cooler but it was still the 11th warmest year since records began in 1880. Of the 13 warmest years since 1880, 11 were the years from 2001 to 2011. Over the more recent record, 2011 was the warmest La Ni&lt;U+00F1&gt;a year in the period from 1950 to 2011, and was close to 1997 which was not at the lowest point of the cycle.47
Temperature changes vary over the globe. Since 1979, land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures ( per decade against  per decade).48 Ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because the ocean loses more heat by evaporation.49 The northern hemisphere is also naturally warmer than the southern hemisphere mainly because of meridional heat transport in the oceans which has a differential of about 0.9 petawatts northwards,50 with an additional contribution from the albedo differences between the polar regions. Since the beginning of industrialisation the interhemispheric temperature difference has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the North.51 Average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world in the past 100 years, however arctic temperatures are also highly variable.52 Although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the Northern than Southern Hemisphere this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to mix between hemispheres.53
The thermal inertia of the oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects mean that climate can take centuries or longer to adjust to changes in forcing. Climate commitment studies indicate that even if greenhouse gases were stabilized at 2000 levels, a further warming of about  () would still occur.54
Initial causes of temperature changes (external forcings)
The climate system can respond to changes in external forcings.5556 External forcings can &quot;push&quot; the climate in the direction of warming or cooling.57 Examples of external forcings include changes in atmospheric composition (e.g., increased concentrations of greenhouse gases), solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in Earth's orbit around the Sun.58 Orbital cycles vary slowly over tens of thousands of years and at present are in an overall cooling trend which would be expected to lead towards an ice age, but the 20th century instrumental temperature record shows a sudden rise in global temperatures.59
Greenhouse gases
The greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in the atmosphere warm a planet's lower atmosphere and surface. It was proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824, discovered in 1860 by John Tyndall,60 was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896,61 and was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by Guy Stewart Callendar.62 
Naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases have a mean warming effect of about .63 Without the earth's atmosphere the temperature across almost the entire surface of the earth would be below freezing.64 The major greenhouse gases are water vapor, which causes about 36&lt;U+2013&gt;70% of the greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes 9&lt;U+2013&gt;26%; methane (CH4), which causes 4&lt;U+2013&gt;9%; and ozone (O3), which causes 3&lt;U+2013&gt;7%.656667 Clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases.
Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from CO2, methane, tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide. According to work published in 2007, the concentrations of CO2 and methane have increased by 36% and 148% respectively since 1750.68 These levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores.69707172 Less direct geological evidence indicates that CO2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago.73 Fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in CO2 from human activity over the past 20 years. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use, particularly deforestation.74 Estimates of global CO2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion, including cement production and gas flaring, was 34.8 billion tonnes (9.5 &lt;U+00B1&gt; 0.5 PgC), an increase of 54% above emissions in 1990. Coal burning was responsible for 43% of the total emissions, oil 34%, gas 18%, cement 4.9% and gas flaring 0.7%75 In May 2013, it was reported that readings for CO2 taken at the world's primary benchmark site in Mauna Loa surpassed 400 ppm. According to professor Brian Hoskins, this is likely the first time CO2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years.7677
Over the last three decades of the 20th century, gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions.78 CO2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.7980 Emissions can be attributed to different regions, e.g., see the figure opposite. Attribution of emissions due to land-use change is a controversial issue.8182
Emissions scenarios, estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases, have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic, sociological, technological, and natural developments.83 In most scenarios, emissions continue to rise over the century, while in a few, emissions are reduced.8485 Fossil fuel reserves are abundant, and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century.86 Emission scenarios, combined with modelling of the carbon cycle, have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future. Using the six IPCC SRES &quot;marker&quot; scenarios, models suggest that by the year 2100, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm.87 This is an increase of 90&lt;U+2013&gt;250% above the concentration in the year 1750.
The popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion, i.e., the destruction of stratospheric ozone by chlorofluorocarbons.8889 Although there are a few areas of linkage, the relationship between the two is not strong. Reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures, while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect.90 
Particulates and soot
Ship tracks over the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of the United States. The climatic impacts from particulate forcing could have a large effect on climate through the indirect effect.
Global dimming, a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the Earth's surface, was observed from 1961 until at least 1990.91 The main cause of this dimming is particulates produced by volcanoes and human made pollutants, which exerts a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight. The effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion &lt;U+2013&gt; CO2 and aerosols &lt;U+2013&gt; have largely offset one another in recent decades, so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane.92 Radiative forcing due to particulates is temporally limited due to wet deposition which causes them to have an atmospheric lifetime of one week. Carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more, and as such, changes in particulate concentrations will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide.93
In addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, particulates have indirect effects on the Earth's radiation budget.94 Sulfates act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets, known as the Twomey effect.95 This effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size, which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight, known as the Albrecht effect.96 Indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds, and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds. Indirect effects of particulates represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.97
Soot may cool or warm the surface, depending on whether it is airborne or deposited. Atmospheric soot directly absorb solar radiation, which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface. In isolated areas with high soot production, such as rural India, as much as 50% of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds.98 When deposited, especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions, the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface.99 The influences of particulates, including black carbon, are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics, particularly in Asia, while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere.100
Solar activity
Since 1978, output from the Sun has been precisely measured by satellites.101 These measurements indicate that the Sun's output has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the Earth. In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.102
Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.103 Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings.
Another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere have changed.104 Models and observations show that greenhouse warming results in warming of the lower atmosphere (called the troposphere) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the stratosphere).105106 Depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun were responsible for observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and stratosphere would be expected.107
Feedback
Sea ice, shown here in Nunavut, in northern Canada, reflects more sunshine, while open ocean absorbs more, accelerating melting.
The climate system includes a range of feedbacks which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings. Positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing, while negative feedbacks reduce the response of the climate system to an initial forcing.108
There are a range of feedbacks in the climate system, including water vapor, changes in ice-albedo (snow and ice cover affect how much the Earth's surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight), clouds, and changes in the Earth's carbon cycle (e.g., the release of carbon from soil).109 The main negative feedback is the energy which the Earth's surface radiates into space as infrared radiation.110 According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, if temperature doubles, radiated energy increases by a factor of 16 (2 to the 4th power).111
Feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Other factors being equal, a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing.112 Uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario. More research is needed to understand the role of clouds113 and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections.114
The IPCC projections given in the lede span the &quot;likely&quot; range (greater than 66% probability, based on expert judgement)115 for the selected emissions scenarios. However, the IPCC's projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty.116 The lower end of the &quot;likely&quot; range appears to be better constrained than the upper end of the &quot;likely&quot; range.117
Climate models
A climate model is a computerized representation of the five components of the climate system: Atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface, and biosphere.118 Such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics, thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer. The models take into account various components, such as local air movement, temperature, clouds, and other atmospheric properties; ocean temperature, salt content, and circulation; ice cover on land and sea; the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere; chemical and biological processes; solar variability and others.
Although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible, simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system. Results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model's climate sensitivity. For example, the uncertainty in IPCC's 2007 projections is caused by (1) the use of multiple models119 with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations,120 (2) the use of differing estimates of humanities' future greenhouse gas emissions,121 (3) any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models IPCC used to prepare its report, i.e., greenhouse gas releases from permafrost.122
The models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases. Instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes. One of the mathematical results of these complex equations is a prediction whether warming or cooling will occur.123
Recent research has called special attention to the need to refine models with respect to the effect of clouds124 and the carbon cycle.125126127
Models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human-derived causes. Although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects, they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by man-made greenhouse gas emissions.128
The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.129 Climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century, but do not simulate all aspects of climate.130 Not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the IPCC. Observed Arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted.131 Precipitation increased proportional to atmospheric humidity, and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict.132133
Observed and expected environmental effects
  &quot;Detection&quot; is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without providing a reason for that change. Detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause. &quot;Attribution&quot; of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence.134 Detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical, ecological and social systems.135
Natural systems
Global warming has been detected in a number of natural systems. Some of these changes are described in the section on observed temperature changes, e.g., sea level rise and widespread decreases in snow and ice extent.136 Anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes, including sea level rise, changes in climate extremes (such as the number of warm and cold days), declines in Arctic sea ice extent, and to glacier retreat.137
Over the 21st century,138 the IPCC projects that global mean sea level could rise by 0.18-0.59 m.139 The IPCC do not provide a best estimate of global mean sea level rise, and their upper estimate of 59 cm is not an upper-bound, i.e., global mean sea level could rise by more than 59 cm by 2100.140 The IPCC's projections are conservative, and may underestimate future sea level rise.141 Over the 21st century, Parris and others142 suggest that global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m (0.7-6.6 ft), relative to mean sea level in 1992.
Widespread coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia.143 For example, sustained global warming of more than 2 &lt;U+00B0&gt;C (relative to pre-industrial levels) could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice caps.144 Melting of the Greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5 m over many thousands of years.145
Changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern latitudes, and least warming over the Southern Ocean and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.146 During the 21st century, glaciers147 and snow cover148 are projected to continue their widespread retreat. Projections of declines in Arctic sea ice vary.149150 Recent projections suggest that Arctic summers could be ice-free (defined as ice extent less than 1 million square km) as early as 2025-2030.151
Future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends, with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas, and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions.152 Projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events, such as heat waves.153
Ecological systems
In terrestrial ecosystems, the earlier timing of spring events, and poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges, have been linked with high confidence to recent warming.154 Future climate change is expected to particularly affect certain ecosystems, including tundra, mangroves, and coral reefs.155 It is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric CO2 levels, combined with higher global temperatures.156 Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.157
Increases in atmospheric  concentrations have led to an increase in ocean acidity.158 Dissolved  increases ocean acidity, which is measured by lower pH values.159 Between 1750 to 2000, surface-ocean pH has decreased by ~0.1, from ~8.2 to ~8.1.160 Surface-ocean pH has probably not been below ~8.1 during the past 2 million years.161 Projections suggest that surface-ocean pH could decrease by an additional 0.3-0.4 units by 2100.162 Future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society.163
5. Ocean acidification, in 
Large-scale and abrupt impacts
Climate change could result in global, large-scale changes in natural and social systems.164 Two examples are ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and the long-term melting of ice sheets, which contributes to sea level rise.165
Some large-scale changes could occur abruptly, i.e., over a short time period, and might also be irreversible. An example of abrupt climate change is the rapid release of methane from permafrost, which would lead to amplified global warming.166 Scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor.167 However, the probability of abrupt changes appears to be very low.168169 Factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming, warming that occurs more rapidly, and warming that is sustained over longer time periods.170
Observed and expected effects on social systems
Vulnerability of human societies to climate change mainly lies in the effects of extreme weather events rather than gradual climate change.171 Impacts of climate change so far include adverse effects on small islands,172 adverse effects on indigenous populations in high-latitude areas,173 and small but discernable effects on human health.174 Over the 21st century, climate change is likely to adversely affect hundreds of millions of people through increased coastal flooding, reductions in water supplies, increased malnutrition and increased health impacts.175 Most economic studies suggest that global warming would reduce world gross domestic product (GDP).176177
Food security
Under present trends, by 2030, maize production in Southern Africa could decrease by up to 30% while rice, millet and maize in South Asia could decrease by up to 10%.178 By 2080, yields in developing countries could decrease by 10% to 25% on average while India could see a drop of 30% to 40%.179 By 2100, while the population of three billion is expected to double, rice and maize yields in the tropics are expected to decrease by 20&lt;U+2013&gt;40% because of higher temperatures without accounting for the decrease in yields as a result of soil moisture and water supplies stressed by rising temperatures.180
Future warming of around  (by 2100, relative to 1990&lt;U+2013&gt;2000) could result in increased crop yields in mid- and high-latitude areas, but in low-latitude areas, yields could decline, increasing the risk of malnutrition.181 A similar regional pattern of net benefits and costs could occur for economic (market-sector) effects.182 Warming above  could result in crop yields falling in temperate regions, leading to a reduction in global food production.183
Habitat inundation
In small islands and megadeltas, inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements.184185 This could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low lying areas such as Bangladesh, as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the Maldives and Tuvalu.186
Proposed policy responses to global warming
There are different views over what the appropriate policy response to climate change should be.187 These competing views weigh the benefits of limiting emissions of greenhouse gases against the costs. In general, it seems likely that climate change will impose greater damages and risks in poorer regions.188
Mitigation
 Reducing the amount of future climate change is called mitigation of climate change.189 The IPCC defines mitigation as activities that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb GHGs from the atmosphere.190 Studies indicate substantial potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of emission-reducing activities such as energy conservation, increased energy efficiency, and satisfying more of society's power demands with renewable energy and/or nuclear energy sources.191 Climate mitigation also includes acts to enhance natural sinks, such as reforestation.192
In order to limit warming to within the lower range described in the IPCC's &quot;Summary Report for Policymakers&quot;193 it will be necessary to adopt policies that will limit greenhouse gas emissions to one of several significantly different scenarios described in the full report.194 This will become more and more difficult with each year of increasing volumes of emissions and even more drastic measures will be required in later years to stabilize a desired atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Energy-related carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2010 were the highest in history, breaking the prior record set in 2008.195
Adaptation
Other policy responses include adaptation to climate change. Adaptation to climate change may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change, or spontaneous, i.e., without government intervention.196 Planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis.197 The barriers, limits, and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood.198
A concept related to adaptation is &quot;adaptive capacity&quot;, which is the ability of a system (human, natural or managed) to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with consequences.199 Unmitigated climate change (i.e., future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions) would, in the long term, be likely to exceed the capacity of natural, managed and human systems to adapt.200
Environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail, while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.201
Discourse about global warming
Political discussion
Article 2 of the UN Framework Convention refers explicitly to &quot;stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.&quot;202 In order to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of , emissions worldwide would need to be dramatically reduced from their present level.203
Most countries are Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).204 The ultimate objective of the Convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system.205 As is stated in the Convention, this requires that GHG concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion.206 The Framework Convention was agreed in 1992, but since then, global emissions have risen.207 During negotiations, the G77 (a lobbying group in the United Nations representing 133 developing nations)208 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to &quot;[take] the lead&quot; in reducing their emissions.209 This was justified on the basis that: the developed world's emissions had contributed most to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere; per-capita emissions (i.e., emissions per head of population) were still relatively low in developing countries; and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs.210 This mandate was sustained in the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention,211 which entered into legal effect in 2005.212
In ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions. These first-round commitments expire in 2012.213 US President George W. Bush rejected the treaty on the basis that &quot;it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centers such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the US economy.&quot;214
At the 15th UNFCCC Conference of the Parties, held in 2009 at Copenhagen, several UNFCCC Parties produced the Copenhagen Accord.215 Parties associated with the Accord (140 countries, as of November 2010)216 aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below .217 A preliminary assessment published in November 2010 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests a possible &quot;emissions gap&quot; between the voluntary pledges made in the Accord and the emissions cuts necessary to have a &quot;likely&quot; (greater than 66% probability) chance of meeting the  objective.218 The UNEP assessment takes the  objective as being measured against the pre-industrial global mean temperature level. To having a likely chance of meeting the  objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.
The 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) was held at Canc&lt;U+00FA&gt;n in 2010. It produced an agreement, not a binding treaty, that the Parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to  above pre-industrial temperatures. It also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of .219
Scientific discussion
Most scientists agree that humans are contributing to observed climate change.220221 A meta study of academic papers concerning global warming, published between 1991 and 2011 and accessible from Web of Knowledge, found that among those whose abstracts expressed a position on the cause of global warming, 97.2% supported the consensus view that it is man made.222 In an October 2011 paper published in the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, researchers from George Mason University analyzed the results of a survey of 489 American scientists working in academia, government, and industry. Of those surveyed, 97% agreed that that global temperatures have risen over the past century and 84% agreed that &quot;human-induced greenhouse warming&quot; is now occurring, only 5% disagreeing that human activity is a significant cause of global warming.223224 National science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions.225
In the scientific literature, there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.226227
Discussion by the public and in popular media
The global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes, substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature,228229 regarding the nature, causes, and consequences of global warming. The disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature, especially since the mid-20th century, whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations, whether humankind has contributed significantly to it, and whether the increase is wholly or partially an artifact of poor measurements. Additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity, predictions of additional warming, and what the consequences of global warming will be.
From 1990&lt;U+2013&gt;1997 in the United States, conservative think tanks mobilized to undermine the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem. They challenged the scientific evidence, argued that global warming will have benefits, and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good.230
Some people deny aspects of climate change science.231
 Organizations such as the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, conservative commentators, and some companies such as ExxonMobil have challenged IPCC climate change scenarios, funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus, and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls.232233234
 Some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years,235 or called for policies to reduce global warming.236
Surveys of public opinion
Researchers at the University of Michigan have found that the public's belief as to the causes of global warming depends on the wording choice used in the polls.237
In 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;2008 Gallup Polls surveyed 127 countries. Over a third of the world's population was unaware of global warming, with people in developing countries less aware than those in developed, and those in Africa the least aware. Of those aware, Latin America leads in belief that temperature changes are a result of human activities while Africa, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and a few countries from the Former Soviet Union lead in the opposite belief.238 There is a significant contrast of the opinions of the concept and the appropriate response between Europe and the United States. Nick Pidgeon of Cardiff University said that &quot;results show the different stages of engagement about global warming on each side of the Atlantic&quot;, adding, &quot;The debate in Europe is about what action needs to be taken, while many in the US still debate whether climate change is happening.&quot;239240 A 2010 poll by the Office of National Statistics found that 75% of UK respondents were at least &quot;fairly convinced&quot; that the world's climate is changing, compared to 87% in a similar survey in 2006.241 A January 2011 ICM poll in the UK found 83% of respondents viewed climate change as a current or imminent threat, while 14% said it was no threat. Opinion was unchanged from an August 2009 poll asking the same question, though there had been a slight polarisation of opposing views.242
By 2010, with 111 countries surveyed, Gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease in the number of Americans and Europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat. In the US, a little over half the population (53%) now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families; this was 10% below the 2008 poll (63%). Latin America had the biggest rise in concern, with 73% saying global warming was a serious threat to their families.243 That global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes, except in the USA where nearly half (47%) of the population attributed global warming to natural causes.244
A March&lt;U+2013&gt;May 2013 survey by Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press polled 39 countries about global threats. According to 54% of those questioned, global warming featured top of the perceived global threats.245 In a January survey, Pew found that 69% of Americans say there is solid evidence that the earth&lt;U+2019&gt;s average temperature has been getting warmer over the past few decades, up six points since November 2011 and 12 points since 2009.246
Etymology
The term global warming was probably first used in its modern sense on 8 August 1975 in a science paper by Wally Broecker in the journal Science called &quot;Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?&quot;.247248249 Broecker's choice of words was new and represented a significant recognition that the climate was warming; previously the phrasing used by scientists was &quot;inadvertent climate modification,&quot; because while it was recognized humans could change the climate, no one was sure which direction it was going.250 The National Academy of Sciences first used global warming in a 1979 paper called the Charney Report, which said: &quot;if carbon dioxide continues to increase, [we find] no reason to doubt that climate changes will result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible.&quot;251 The report made a distinction between referring to surface temperature changes as global warming, while referring to other changes caused by increased CO2 as climate change.252
Global warming became more widely popular after 1988 when NASA climate scientist James Hansen used the term in a testimony to Congress.253 He said: &quot;global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming.&quot;254 His testimony was widely reported and afterward global warming was commonly used by the press and in public discourse.255
