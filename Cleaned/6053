Waquoit Bay and environs
Waquoit Bay is a small landlocked tidal bay on the south shore of Cape Cod in the US state of Massachusetts. The bay is connected with Nantucket Sound and separates the towns of Mashpee and Falmouth.
In the early 1960s Norwegian researcher Johannes Kr. Torn&lt;U+00F6&gt;e suggested the shallow bay could be the location of Leifsbudir, (Leif's booths or houses) the long sought site of the Norse colony of Vinland.
