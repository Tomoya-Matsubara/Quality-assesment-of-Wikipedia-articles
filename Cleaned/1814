Biography
Early years
Benson was born in Plainfield, Michigan on November 6, 1871. His father, Adelbert L. Benson, was a factory worker during Allan's boyhood, later becoming a miller, while his mother, Rose Morris Benson, died when Allan was an infant.1 Allan lived until he was 12 with his grandfather, a farmer in Silver Creek, Michigan.2
At the age of 15, Benson's father's mill burned and he was forced to give up his aspiration of attending college and becoming a lawyer.3 Benson left home and took a job in a chair factory, later working in a paper mill.4
Benson only attended one year of high school, but he nevertheless took the state examination to become a school teacher and passed, earning a certificate to teach in a district school.5 He became involved in a physical conflict with some farm boys in the first school to which he was assigned and was apparently forced to resign his post.6
In April 1891, Benson left Otsego, Michigan for Detroit, where he went to work for the Peninsular Car Company as a machine hand.7 He began to regularly visit the offices of the various Detroit newspapers in search of a position and was finally hired as a reporter, earning the starvation wage of $6 a week.8
Benson moved to Ann Arbor in the fall of 1891 to assume the position of managing editor of the Washetaw Daily Times.9 He continued to move up the ranks of the newspaper profession, moving to a position as telegraph editor of the Chicago Inter-Ocean in the spring of 1892.10 He later worked as telegraph editor of the Salt Lake Tribune and as a writer in San Francisco.11
Benson subsequently worked as managing editor of the Detroit Journal, the Detroit Times, and the Washington Times. He married Mary Hugh in Windsor, Ontario on November 19, 1899 and had four children.
Political career
In 1916, after Eugene V. Debs declined the Socialist Party's nomination for the Presidential candidacy, Benson was nominated by a direct mail vote of party members. Benson received 590,524 votes for 3.2% of the total vote.12 Benson was an anti-war voice in the years leading up to World War I; one of the planks of his Presidential campaign platform was that war should be only entered into by national referendum. However, when the Socialist Party issued a manifesto placing equal blame on Germany and the allies, he resigned from the party.
 From January 1919 through June 1921, Benson was the publisher of a new monthly magazine called Reconstruction, subtitled &quot;A Herald of the New Time.&quot; The publication used a newsprint format similar to The Nation and The New Republic and advanced a liberal political line slightly to the right of those journals. Frequent contributors included former Socialists Charles Edward Russell and Max S. Hayes. A substantial run of the publication is present in the collection of the New York Public Library.13
Later years, death, and legacy
Benson's later years were spent housebound in Yonkers, New York. Several months before his death, Benson wrote a letter to cartoonist Art Young explaining his plight:
&quot;I am suffering not from pernicious anemia but from the injury to my nervous system that this disease did when four dumbbell doctors (who were supposed to be good) did not recognize it for what it was and let it go until I collapsed, was in bed for six months and have scarcely been able to walk across the room ever since. I have been away from the house but seven times in nine years, for an hour's motor trip each time, and have not now been out in almost two years. I am in more or less distress all the time, but I read almost constantly and thus enjoy myself pretty well considering the circumstances.&quot;14
Benson died in Yonkers, New York, on August 19, 1940.
