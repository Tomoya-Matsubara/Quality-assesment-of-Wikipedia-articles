The New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) is an athletic conference consisting of eleven highly selective liberal arts colleges and universities located in New England and New York. Most of the schools have been competing against each other since the 1800s and are often referred to as the &quot;Little Ivies&quot;.
The idea for such an athletic conference originated with an agreement among Amherst College, Bowdoin College, Wesleyan University and Williams College first drafted in 1955.1 In 1971 Bates College, Colby College, Hamilton College, Middlebury College, Trinity College, Tufts University, and  Union College joined on and NESCAC was officially formed. Today's sustaining members include all the original members but Union, which withdrew in 1977, replaced by Connecticut College in 1982.
Mission
NESCAC schools share a similar philosophy for intercollegiate athletics. The Conference was created out of a concern for the direction of intercollegiate athletic programs and remains committed to keeping a proper perspective on the role of sport in higher education. Member institutions believe athletic teams should be representative of school's entire student bodies and hew to NCAA Division III admissions and financial policies prohibiting athletic scholarships while awarding financial aid solely on the basis of need.2
NESCAC members stress that intercollegiate athletic programs should operate in harmony with the educational mission of each institution. Schools are committed to maintaining common boundaries to keep athletics strong yet in proportion to their overall academic mission. Presidents of each NESCAC institution control intercollegiate athletic policy.
Conference tenets are usually more restrictive than those of the NCAA Division III regarding season length, number of contests and post-season competition.

NCAA Division III competition
Prior to 1993, NESCAC generally did not allow its member schools to send teams to NCAA championships. Since then, all sports except football have had this freedom, and have excelled in the NCAA Division III championships. For example, the Division III NACDA Director's Cup, awarded since 1996 to the college or university that wins the most college championships, has been awarded to Williams College every year except 1998.
In addition to the ban on post-season play, the football league is notable for being completely isolated from the rest of Division III play&lt;U+2014&gt;each team in the NESCAC plays only other teams in the NESCAC. While some Division II and Division III teams play only conference schedules, the NESCAC is unique that all of its members choose to play only conference games. 3
Middlebury College leads the conference in total number of National Championships, having won 30 individual titles since the NESCAC lifted its ban on NCAA play. Williams College is second, having won 14 in sports including Men's Basketball (1), Men's Soccer (1), Men's and Women's Tennis (3, 2), Men's and Women's Cross Country (2, 2), Women's Crew (2), and Women's Indoor Track &amp; Field (1). Tufts University, holds the distinction of playing the first game of college football between two American colleges, a contest between Tufts and Harvard University on June 4, 1875 in Cambridge, Massachusetts and played its second game in 1875 against Bates College in the first intercollegiate football game in Maine.

In Division III, Williams College athletic spending is second only to Christopher Newport University, which spends 2% more than Williams but has more than twice as many students. Connecticut College athletic spending is unusually low because it does not have a football team. Tufts per-student athletic spending is low because it has nearly double the undergraduate population (5,000) of its nearest NESCAC rival (Wesleyan, with 2,700).
