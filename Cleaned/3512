ZAD 2 or Zahrat adh-Dhra&lt;U+02BB&gt; 2 is an early Neolithic archeological site  north of the village of edh-Dhra on the Lisan Peninsula, in modern-day Jordan.
The site is a low, small tell mound at an altitude of  below sea level. Excavations were carried out to a depth of  in 1999 by Phillip C. Edwards of La Trobe University.1 Several rounded stone buildngs were found with plaster floors although lime-firing pyrotechnology was probably not used in their preparation. A large number of flint tools were found including sickles, picks, axes, drills, arrowheads and scrapers made from local flint sources. A few examples of stone tools made from other materials such as quartz, obsidian and quartzite were discovered. Other discoveries included a ceramic figure, greenstone, some copper ore and two incised fragments of burnt limestone suggesting early neolithic use of art and symbols.2 Radiocarbon dates for the site range between 9140 and 8470 BC. This has suggested occupation during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and possibly during the transitional phase into the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B between 8800 and 8600 BC that was identified in 2002 by Danielle Stordeur and Fr&lt;U+00E9&gt;d&lt;U+00E9&gt;ric Abb&lt;U+00E8&gt;s.
