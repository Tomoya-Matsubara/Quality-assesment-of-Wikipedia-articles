Alexander's Ragtime Band (1938) is a film, released by Twentieth Century Fox, that takes off from the 1911 Irving Berlin song &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot;, to tell a story of a society boy who scandalizes his family by pursuing a career in ragtime instead of in &quot;serious&quot; music. It stars Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley, and Jean Hersholt.
The story was written by Berlin himself, with Kathryn Scola, Richard Sherman, and Lamar Trotti. It was directed by Henry King.
Songs
The story strings together 28 Irving Berlin songs. Old songs were combined with new ones written especially for the film, as Berlin was also to do with the motion pictures Holiday Inn, Blue Skies, and White Christmas. Alexander's Ragtime Band was released in 1938, but was set in the World War I era (1914 - 1918). As a result, there were some anomalies; for example, &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, sung by Ethel Merman, and &quot;Easter Parade&quot; were not written until 1933.
