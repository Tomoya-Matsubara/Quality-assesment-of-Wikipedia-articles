Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola (December, 1559 - March, 1613), Spanish dramatist and poet, was baptized at Barbastro on December 14, 1559.
He was educated at the universities of Huesca and Saragossa, becoming secretary to the duke de Villahermosa in 1585. He was appointed historiographer of Aragon in 1599, and in 1610 accompanied the count de Lemos to Naples, where he died in March 1613.
His tragedies—Fills, Isabela and Alejandra—are said by Cervantes to have &quot;filled all who heard them with admiration, delight and interest&quot;; Filis is lost, and Isabela and Alejandra, which were not printed till 1772, are imitations of Seneca.
Argensola's poems were published with those of his brother in 1634; they consist of translations from the Latin poets, and of original satires.
