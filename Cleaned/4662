They also have released three extended-play (EP) albums, Cheap Tricks and Theatrics,1 Get Scared EP2 and Built for Blame, Laced with Shame which was the third EP to only feature former lead vocalist Joel Faviere who departed the band in November 2012. The original lead vocalist Nicholas Matthews rejoined the band in November 2012 after Faviere's departure.
History
Formation and early years (2008&lt;U+2013&gt;2010)
Before forming the band, Matthews, Johnny Braddock, Bradley Lloyd and Warren Peace were all in separate bands. All four came together to form the band and self-released their first EP, Cheap Tricks and Theatrics.
The only single from the EP, &quot;If Only She Knew Voodoo Like I Do&quot;, became an internet success and received attention from Universal Motown Records3 with a popular video as well.
During the summer of 2010, the band went on Hot Topic's Sacred Ceremony tour with Black Veil Brides and Vampires Everywhere!, helping promote the band's music. When they returned from the tour, they released the Get Scared EP, their first release through Universal Motown Records. The Get Scared EP featured the mastered remakes of the songs &quot;Setting Yourself Up for Sarcasm&quot; and &quot;If She Only Knew Voodoo Like I Do&quot; with the shortened names &quot;Sarcasm&quot; and &quot;Voodoo&quot;.
The band then embarked on several tours, notably the first leg of The Dead Masquerade Tour (with Escape the Fate, Alesana, Drive A and Motionless in White) from January to March 20114 and an Aiden headliner including Eyes Set To Kill, Dr. Acula, Vampires Everywhere!, and Escape the Fate (only certain dates) in the spring of 2011.5
Departure of Matthews (2011)
On November 30, 2011, the band announced that Matthews was leaving the band.6 They stated that Matthews wanted to pursue more options in his musical career and that it was a surprise to the entire band. The band left a &quot;note&quot; on their Facebook page explaining the situation:
The band postponed any touring dates until further notice due to the sudden departure and lack of a lead vocalist. In the same message, they also announced that they will be holding auditions for lead vocalist, and any fan could participate.
Guitarist Braddock later revealed more details about Matthews's departure from the band through Formspring. &quot;We wrote while Nick was in LA and was ignoring us. We kept trying to communicate with him and randomly we'd get a response... But he would only ask for money and disregard everything else..then he eventually told us he quit. Through a Facebook message haha..&quot;.7
Matthews announced details for a new solo project, My Black and White, but quit the project shortly after and joined his wife, Alexis Matthews, in Blacklisted Me as a full-time member. He has his own web store based on My Black and White.
Induction of Faviere; Built for Blame, Laced with Shame (2011–2012)
On December 14, 2011, the band tentatively announced that they were releasing six previously unreleased B-sides on iTunes, set for release on December 19. The songs will include the first songs the band wrote and recorded but were not added to the Cheap Tricks and Theatrics EP nor their debut album for unknown reasons. On December 18, a day prior to the release, the band announced the track listing for Cheap Tricks and Theatrics B-Sides, and then released the EP the following day on iTunes and Amazon.
On December 21, the band announced via Facebook and Twitter that they had chosen the new vocalist for the band, but would not be announcing it until sometime after Christmas.
The band re-entered the studio with the new lead vocalist on December 28. Although it was not officially announced who the new vocalist was, at the time there was much speculation that Dear Chandelier singer Faviere replaced Matthews, due to the tweets sent by Faviere and some of the members of Get Scared on Twitter.89 
On January 5, 2012, the band announced on their Facebook that if that specific post reached 10,000 &quot;likes&quot;, they would reveal the release date for the upcoming single with the new lead vocalist. Although the post only got to nearly 6,000 likes within 24 hours, the band still announced the details for the single. On January 6, the group announced that their new single, &quot;Cynical Skin&quot;, the first with Faviere would be released on iTunes on January 9, 2012.10 Little over an hour later, they revealed the artwork to the single.11 A 30-second preview of the song was also released on Amazon.12 
The band began recording songs for their upcoming album on May 23, with Erik Ron (Panic! at the Disco, Allstar Weekend, Attaloss, Saosin) producing the album.
On July 2, the lyrics to &quot;Built For Blame&quot; were posted to the band's Facebook wall in a contest type fashion for the fans to create lyrical slideshows filled with pictures and send them in. On July 20, Faviere hinted &quot;Built For Blame&quot; would be released August 1, 2012, stating &quot;8/1/12 am I to blame?&quot; &quot;Built For Blame&quot; was released at 12:00 EST on August 1, with links to the band's new Merchnow page, including a pre-order for their new EP Built for Blame, Laced With Shame, set to be released August 28 on Grey Area Records. The album hit #20 on the Billboard Heat seekers chart.13
Departure of Faviere and return of Matthews (since 2012)
After Faviere's short time as lead vocalist in November, he departed from the band. On November 19, 2012, the band posted a video to their YouTube channel, announcing that Matthews would be returning to the band. Two days later on November 21, they also announced that Adam Virostko would be joining the band as a guitarist.
