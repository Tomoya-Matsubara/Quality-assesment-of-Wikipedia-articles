&quot;Secret&quot; is a song by Madonna, released as the first single from her 1994 album Bedtime Stories. It was released in September 1994 and became a top ten hit around the world, including reaching number three in the United States and five in the UK. It was later included on her greatest hits compilations GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009).
Song information
&quot;Secret&quot; was originally written and produced by Madonna with Shep Pettibone, who she had collaborated with on the 1992 album Erotica. On release, the song was credited to Madonna and Dallas Austin. Pettibone was not acknowledged as co-writer until the release of a 2001 remix compilation album GHV2 Remixed: The Best of 1991-2001.
Musically, &quot;Secret&quot; is in the key of E-flat minor.1 According to The Official Charts Company, &quot;Secret&quot; has sold 117,957 copies in the United Kingdom, as of August 2008.2
Unusual for the mid-90's, Madonna promoted this song on the Internet, with a 30-second sample of &quot;Secret&quot; and the cover image of the then-unreleased Bedtime Stories. She also left a message with the following words:3
The last part of her message referred to a brief trend of AOL chatroom users impersonating her; this was confirmed by MTV News.
The song was performed on tour for the first time during her 2001 Drowned World Tour. It was later performed at the Houston stop of her Sticky and Sweet Tour in November, 2008, as a fan request. Slant Magazine listed &quot;Secret&quot; as the 42nd &quot;Best Singles of the '90s&quot;.4
Music video
The black and white music video was directed by photographer Melodie McDaniel and was filmed on September 9, 10, 11, 1994 at the Lenox Lounge an on location on Lenox Avenue in Harlem, New York. The video starts with Madonna singing in a club. As the song progresses, she walks down a street and ultimately reaches her home to her boyfriend or husband and a child. Scenes of Madonna are interspersed with scenes of transvestites getting ready, and religious iconography such as rebirth and damnation.
An official remix video was edited by Dan-O-Rama and is known as &quot;Secret (Dan-O-Rama Remix)&quot; - it includes the remix &quot;Junior's Luscious Club Edit&quot; by Junior Vasquez.
