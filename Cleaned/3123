Frank Woodruff Buckles (February 1, 1901 February 27, 2011) was one of the last three surviving World War I veterans in the world, and was the last living American veteran of the war.1 At the time of his death, Buckles was also the oldest verified World War I veteran in the world, and the second-oldest male military veteran in the world.2 Although not in the military at the time, Buckles spent the majority of World War II as a prisoner of war. After the world wars, he lived at Gap View Farm, in Charles Town, West Virginia, and was the Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation.
Life during the twentieth century
Frank Buckles was born Wood Buckles on February 1, 1901, to a farming family in Bethany, Missouri.3 He and his family subsequently moved to Dewey County, Oklahoma.4
After the the United States entered World War I, Buckles sought to enlist in the armed forces despite his youth. He was turned down by the Marine Corps because of his slight weight and for being under 21, and by the Navy for being flat-footed.5 Buckles finally was successful in enlisting in the United States Army in August 1917. Only 16 years old at the time, Buckles was asked by his recruiter to show a birth certificate. Later Buckles said of that event:
In 1917, Buckles was sent to Europe on the RMS Carpathia, which had rescued RMS Titanic survivors five years earlier. While on the Carpathia, Buckles spoke with crew members who had taken part in the rescue of Titanic survivors. During the war Buckles served in England and France, driving ambulances and motorcycles for the Army's 1st Fort Riley Casual Detachment. After the Armistice in 1918, Buckles escorted prisoners of war back to Germany. Following his discharge in 1920,6 he attended the dedication of the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, Missouri, in honor of those Americans who died in World War I, and he met General John Pershing, commander of all United States forces in France during the war.7
 As of 1942, Buckles had worked for the White Star and W.R. Grace shipping companies, and shipping business took him to Manila in the Philippines.89 He was captured there by the Japanese in 1942, and spent the next three and a half years in the Los Ba&lt;U+00F1&gt;os prison camp. He became malnourished, with a weight below 100 pounds, and developed beriberi, yet led his fellow inmates in calisthenics.10 He was rescued on February 23, 1945.11
After World War II he moved to San Francisco, where he married Audrey Mayo in 1946.12 In the mid-1950s, he retired from steamship work, and bought the  Gap View Farm in West Virginia where he raised cattle.13 His wife died in 1999 and their daughter moved back to the farm to care for him.
Life during the twenty-first century
After the turn of the century, Buckles continued living near Charles Town, West Virginia. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should go to war only &quot;when it's an emergency.&quot;14 When asked about the secret of his long life, Buckles replied: &quot;Hope,&quot; adding, &quot;[W]hen you start to die... don't.&quot; He also said the reason he had lived so long was that, &quot;I never got in a hurry.&quot;15
 Buckles' life was featured on the Memorial Day 2007 episode of NBC Nightly News. On February 4, 2008, with the death of 108-year-old Harry Richard Landis, Buckles became the last surviving American World War I veteran.
On March 6, 2008, he met with President George W. Bush at the White House.1617 The same day, he attended the opening of a Pentagon exhibit featuring photos of nine centenarian World War I veterans created by historian and photographer David DeJonge.18
Businessman Ross Perot, whom Frank Buckles had met at a history seminar in 2001, intervened in 2008 with the White House regarding a resting place.19 On March 19, 2008, Buckles received special approval for underground burial at Arlington National Cemetary.20
Buckles was the Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation,21 which seeks refurbishment of the District of Columbia War Memorial and its establishment as the National World War I Memorial on the National Mall. Buckles appeared before Congress on December 3, 2009, advocating on behalf of such legislation.2223
On February 1, 2010, which was Buckles' 109th birthday, his official biographer announced that he will be completing a film&lt;U+2014&gt;currently in production&lt;U+2014&gt;on Buckles' life. The film is a cumulative work of three years of interviews and intimate moments gathered by DeJonge as he traveled the nation with Buckles.2425
Months away from his 110th birthday, in autumn 2010, Buckles was still giving media interviews.26 Buckles reached supercentenarian status upon his 110th birthday, on February 1, 2011.
On February 27, 2011, Buckles died of natural causes at his home.27 His death led to renewed calls for a national World War I memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.28 The French plan to send a Defense Ministry official to his funeral, and hope to also send two honor guards and pallbearers. The British will send the air-vice marshal and possibly the British Ambassador.29

Further bibliographic material and resources
The U.S. Library of Congress included Buckles in its Veterans History Project and has audio, video and pictorial information on Buckles' experiences in both world wars, including a full 148-minute video interview.35 Photographer David DeJonge estimates a 2011 release of a documentary on Frank Buckles entitled &quot;Pershing's Last Patriot&quot;,36 and donations are accepted toward production of the film.37
Frank Buckles had his own web site, at frankbuckles.org.38 The site continued to operate after his death. The following statement at his web site introduces Buckles' brief account of his life:
Frank Woodruff Buckles&lt;U+2019&gt; life spanned the awesome, horrible, fantastic, dreadful Twentieth Century. He saw and experienced much. As America&lt;U+2019&gt;s last surviving veteran witness to the First World War, his life experiences and perspective are an artifact in our day which often lacks perspective.
His web site adds: &quot;it is not so much about Frank, but all he represents&quot;.39
