As the predatory social-climbing seductress who can go to any length to satiate her lust for life, Priyanka Chopra rocks the scene like never before.

The actress reinvents herself into this unique individual every single time ranging from batty, bashful and boisterous. This is simply her show.&quot;76 Chopra was working so hard shooting this and other films, travelling for endorsements, performing at live shows, including at the Miss India pageant, that she passed out and was admitted to the hospital while filming What's Your Raashee?.77
In 2010, Chopra appeared in Jugal Hansraj's Pyaar Impossible! opposite Uday Chopra, where she portrayed the role of a beautiful college girl who eventually falls in love with a nerdy boy.

Her next release was Farhan Akhtar's Don 2 alongside Shahrukh Khan, in which she reprised her role of Roma. The film was a sequel to the 2006 action thriller Don.

As you watch her effortlessly beat up some thugs in the movie, you come to the realisation that she may be the first proper female action hero in Bollywood.&quot;87 A review carried by Divanee Magazine mentioned that Chopra surprises with a demeanor like that of Tomb Raider's Lara Croft.88 The film was a major success in India and a blockbuster overseas. It went on to break multiple box-office records in India and overseas, including the highest grossing Bollywood movie overseas in 2011.89
Recent work (2012&lt;U+2013&gt;present)

The film opened to mixed reactions from critics, however Chopra's performance, and her on-screen chemistry with co-star Shahid Kapoor received good reviews. Sonia Chopra of Sify wrote, &quot;Priyanka delivers a superb performance easily slipping in-and-out of the layered characters with dexterity.&quot;94 Taran Adarsh commented, &quot;As the spirited Aradhana of 1910, the dazzling movie star Rukhsar of 1960, or the joyful Radha of 2012, Priyanka is a complete livewire in each of the acts.&quot;95 However, despite the positive critical acclaim, the film failed to do well at the Indian box office, although was a moderate success in the overseas markets.96
 In September 2012, Chopra featured in Anurag Basu's Barfi! alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Ileana D'Cruz. She was cast as Jhilmil Chatterjee; an autistic girl who falls in love with a deaf and mute boy.

Her inherent glamorous personality simply disappears into her character. We don't see the actress on screen at all! We see only Jhilmil who reminds us in a very pleasant way of Sridevi in Sadma. This is one of the most flawless interpretations of a physical-psychological disability seen on celluloid.&quot;100 The film was chosen as India&lt;U+2019&gt;s official entry to the Oscars for the 85th Academy Awards to be held in February 2013.101
