Following the resignation of Robert Heaton Rhodes from his  seat in the New Zealand parliament, William Montgomery contested the 20 April 1874 by-election against Walter Pilliet. The results were 168 and 76 votes, respectively, i.e., a margin of 92 for Montgomery. He thus entered parliament during the 5th term.1
In July 1874, a select committee declared Montgomery's election to be &quot;null and void&quot;, as he had a contract for the supply of railway sleepers with the general government in breach of election rules. The select committee accepted that the breach was inadvertent.2 Montgomery stood for re-election in the second by-election, on 10 August 18743 and was returned unopposed.4
