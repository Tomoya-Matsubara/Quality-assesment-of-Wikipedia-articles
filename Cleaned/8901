John Sidney McCain III  retired from the United States Navy in April 1981. His last four years in the service had been spent as the Navy's liaison to the United States Senate. He moved to Arizona with his new wife and, aided by a job from his father-in-law and the contacts it gave him, soon began a new career in politics.
In 1982, he was elected as a Republican Party United States Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st congressional district. After serving two terms there and making an impression as a rising political figure, he was elected U.S. Senator from Arizona in 1986. He became one of the senators entangled in the Keating Five scandal of the late 1980s, but survived it and was re-elected in 1992 and 1998.
While generally adhering to American conservatism, McCain established a reputation as a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in normalizing diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.

Entry into politics and 1982 House campaign
Having moved to Phoenix in March 1981, McCain went to work for Hensley & Co., his new father-in-law Jim Hensley's large Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship, as Vice President of Public Relations.cite news  url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter5.html  title=John McCain Report: Arizona, the early years  author=Nowicki, Dan and Bill Muller Muller, Bill  publisher=The Arizona Republic  date=2007-03-01  accessdate=2007-11-21  McCain had little interest in the beer business itself, instead preferring to talk to colleagues about current events.cite news   url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/election/mccain/articles/2007/01/23/20070123biz-hensley.html   title=McCain, his wealth tied to wife's family beer business   author=Dawn Gilbertson   publisher=The Arizona Republic   date=2007-01-23   accessdate=2009-02-11  In carrying out his job, he was able to gain political support among the local business community,cite news   author=Frantz, Douglas,   url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0E14FC3F540C728EDDAB0894D8404482   title=The Arizona Ties: A Beer Baron and a Powerful Publisher Put McCain on a Political Path   publisher=The New York Times   pages=A14   date=2000-02-21 meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating, Jr., real estate developer Fife Symington III, newspaper publisher Darrow Duke Tully, and locally-well-known auto dealer Lou Grubb,cite news   url=http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=0fd7470d-a41f-4d9e-9328-fd079b476a0a   title=Made Man   author=Scheiber, Noam   publisher=The New Republic   date=2008-08-20   accessdate=2008-08-22 all the while looking for an electoral opportunity.
McCain's original plan had been to run for a new U.S. House of Representatives seat from Arizona, created by United States congressional apportionment reapportionment following the United States Census, 1980 1980 census, but that turned out to be too far from Phoenix.Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 137140.  Then John Jacob Rhodes, Jr., the longtime Republican congressman from Arizona's 1st congressional district, announced his retirement in January 1982.  This seat encompassed parts of the Phoenix metropolitan area and was very close to where the McCains lived; his wife Cindy McCain bought a house in the district the same day as Rhodes' announcement.  Rhodes suggested that McCain first run for the Arizona Legislature to gain more experience, but McCain had no interest in slowly working his way up.cite news   url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/12/AR2008101202306.html   title=Seeing White House From a Cell in Hanoi   author=Leahy, Michael   publisher=The Washington Post   date=2008-10-13   accessdate=2008-10-17

He faced three candidates in the Republican nomination process, all of whom had entered the race before him: Arizona State Senator Jim Mack, Arizona State Representative Donna Carlson-West, and veterinarian and active civic figure Ray Russell.  The others were all given a good chance to win the primary election; McCain ranked at best third in early polls.Alexander, Man of the People, p. 96.

Still, as a newcomer to the state, McCain was hit with repeated charges of being a carpetbagger.  Finally, at a candidates forum, he gave a famous refutation to a voter making the charge:
quotation Listen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 143144. 
Phoenix Gazette columnist John Kolbe would later label this the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I've ever heard.
McCain's campaign fell into early debt; his wife began loaning him tens of thousands of dollars to keep it alive.cite news   url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23930780/   title=Beer heiress could be next first lady   author=Theimer, Sharon   agency=Associated Press  publisher=MSNBC   date=2008-04-03   accessdate=2008-04-29  Donations also came in from Jim Hensley and other Hensley & Co. executives, but the amounts grew large enough that the Federal Election Commission forced some of it to be returned.  By the close of the primary, McCain was able to outspend his opponents; more of than half of his primary expenditures were financed by the eventual $167,000 that his wife lent to the campaign.  The McCains had made a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate Tax return United States income tax returns.cite news   url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/18/politics/main4027276.shtml   title=McCain Releases His Tax Returns   agency=Associated Press  publisher=CBS News   date=2008-04-18   accessdate=2008-04-24  In the end, $93,000 of the 1982 loan would be forgiven.  The spending advantage made itself felt in television advertising, including a highly effective two-minute mini-documentary that presented him as new leader for Arizona with a record of service to the country.  Rival Mack later called that ad the best political commercial he had ever seen.
McCain was endorsed by Senator John Tower, a friend and mentor from his liaison stint who in turn got McCain the endorsement of former Arizona Governor and Senator Paul Fannin.  Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, the state's most powerful political figure, was officially neutral in the race, but many of his aides were working for McCain's opponents. Goldwater himself was said to view McCain as a political opportunist, despite admiring his military service.  Late in the race, Goldwater appeared to make a public statement critical of McCain, but Tower persuaded Goldwater not to confirm it to reporters and the damage was limited. McCain benefited from the support of Duke Tully's The Arizona Republic, the state's most powerful newspaper. 
McCain won the highly contested primary election on September 7, 1982, getting 32&nbsp;percent of the vote compared to Russell's 26&nbsp;percent, Mack's 22&nbsp;percent, and Carlson-West's 20&nbsp;percent.Timberg, An American Odyssey, p. 145.  He went on to easily win the general election in the heavily Republican district two months later, defeating Democrat William E. Hergarty by a 66&nbsp;percent to 31&nbsp;percent margin.

McCain made an immediate impression in Congress. His POW background, social skills, and contacts from his Navy Senate liaison job made him popular and a star among new House members.cite news   url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/us/politics/18cindy.html   title=Behind McCain, Outsider in Capital Wanting Back In   author=Kantor, Jodi and Halbfinger, David M.   publisher=The New York Times   date=2008-10-17   accessdate=2008-10-18  He was elected the president of the 1983 Republican freshman class of representatives.  After strenuously lobbying the Republican leadership, he was assigned to the United States House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs Committee on Interior Affairs. He coveted this assignment because he wanted to develop expertise on issues relevant to his state, including water rights, public land management, and Native American affairs.McCain and Salter, Worth the Fighting For, pp. 6869. Used to augment motivations and goals in committee assignments supplied by other sources.  He was also assigned to the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Aging Select Committee on Aging, important due to Arizona's large retired population, and eventually to the chairmanship of the Republican Task Force on Indian Affairs.Alexander, Man of the People, p. 97.  He fulfilled a campaign pledge to return to his congressional district every weekend, making 47 such trips in his first year.  On them, he met frequently with constituents and make many public appearances.  This, combined with his wife Cindy's decision to live in Arizona rather than move to Washington, helped solidify his political base in Arizona.
McCain sponsored a number of Indian affairs bills, dealing mainly with distribution of lands to reservations and tribal tax status; most of these bills were unsuccessful.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 9899.  In August 1983, he voted against a bill making Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a federal holiday,cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFDB133EF935A35751C1A96F958260   title= Mockery of Bush an Attempt To Be Funny, Forbes Says   author=Irvin Molotsky   publisher=The New York Times   date=1999-12-06   accessdate=2008-04-11 saying it would be too expensive and that there were already enough federal holidays.

McCains politics at this point were mainly in line with those of President Ronald Reagan, whom McCain would later describe as his greatest political influence:McCain and Salter, Worth the Fighting For, p. 85. I embraced all of the core Reagan convictions: faith in the individual; skepticism of government; free trade and vigorous capitalism; anticommunism; a strong defense; robust internationalism that championed our values abroad; and most important, his eloquently stated belief in America's national greatness ...

He supported the Reagan administration's Foreign policy of the Reagan administration#Nicaragua and Latin America policy towards Central American conflicts,Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 99100. including the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua.  During the early 1980s, he served on the board of the U.S. Council for World Freedom, a chapter of the World Anti-Communist League which was an international group that, among other things, aided the rebels in Nicaragua; McCain suspected the council of illegal activity and resigned in 1984.cite news   author=Yost, Pete   url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/10/06/politics/p212035D66.DTL&feed=rss.news  title=McCain linked to group in Iran-Contra affair  agency=Associated Press  publisher=San Francisco Chronicle  date=2008-10-07   accessdate=2009-02-12 Dead link date=October 2010 bot=H3llBotcite news   author=Schor, Elena   url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/07/uselections2008.johnmccain2   title=Democrats threaten to hit McCain on Iran-Contra link   publisher=The Guardian  date=2008-10-07   location=London
McCain voted against a 1983 resolution allowing President Reagan to keep U.S. Marines deployed as part of the Multinational Force in Lebanon, on the grounds that he did not foresee obtainable objectives in Lebanon. After the catastrophic 1983 Beirut barracks bombing Beirut barracks bombing a month later, this stance against his party and president gained him national media exposure and started his reputation as a political maverick.

He became a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work; he was also given positions on the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Commerce Committee and the Senate Indian Affairs Committee Indian Affairs Committee.

McCain was a strong supporter of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits.Alexander, Man of the People, p. 112.

McCain often supported the Native Americans in the United States Native American agenda, advocating economic development and self-governance, as well as sovereignty and tribe control of adoptions.

After its passage, McCain stated his personal opposition to Indian gaming, but said that when communities under poverty are faced with only one option for economic development, and that is to set up gambling on their reservations, then I cannot disapprove.  The Act enabled the growth of what would become, two decades later, the $23 billion Indian gaming industry, and McCain has been called one of the founding fathers of Indian gaming.cite news url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html  title=For McCain and Team, a Host of Ties to Gambling  author=Becker, Jo coauthors=Don Van Natta, Jr. Van Natta Jr., Don date=September 27, 2008  publisher=The New York Times accessdate=2008-09-29 authorlink=Jo Becker

He told Republicans opposing the state holiday, You will damn well do this. You will make this a holiday. You're making us look like fools. In 1990, a state referendum on enacting the holiday was held; McCain persuaded Ronald Reagan to support it.cite news   author=Tapper, Jake   url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/04/the-complicated.html   title=The Complicated History of John McCain and MLK Day   publisher=ABC News   date=2008-04-03   accessdate=2008-05-28   authorlink=Jake Tapper

During the late 1980s, McCain gained some national visibility. He delivered a speech, about a fellow Hanoi Hilton prisoner's persistence in making an American flag despite beatings, that drew audience tears and a standing ovation at the 1988 Republican National Convention.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 115119. He was mentioned by the press as being on the short list for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush's vice-presidential running mate, and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush.Alexander, Man of the People, p. 120. In 1989, he became a staunch defender of his friend John Tower's doomed nomination for U.S. Secretary of Defense; McCain butted heads with Moral Majority co-founder Paul Weyrich, who was challenging Tower regarding alleged heavy drinking and extramarital affairs.  Thus began McCain's difficult relationship with the Christian right; he would later write that Weyrich was a pompous self-serving son of a bitch.
McCain supported the United States invasion of Panama in 1989.  McCain partnered with Senator Al Gore on the 1989 Missile and Proliferation Control Act, which established sanctions on companies and nations that engaged in the trade or development of long-range missile systems,cite book   last=Goldgeier   first=James M.   coauthor= Michael McFaul   title=Power and Purpose: U.S. Policy Toward Russia After the Cold War   publisher=Brookings Institution Press   year=2003   isbn=0815731736 p. 162.  and the 1992 Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act commonly known as the Gore-McCain Act, which established penalties for persons and companies assisting Iraq or Iran in acquiring missile technology.cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EEDB153FF930A25753C1A9669C8B63   title= Despite a Secret Pact by Gore in '95, Russian Arms Sales to Iran Go On   author=Broder, John M.   publisher=The New York Times   date=2000-10-13cite web   url=http://www.state.gov/t/isn/c15237.htm   title=Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992   publisher=U.S. Department of State   accessdate=2008-09-26
Keating Five scandal
John McCain's upward political trajectory was jolted when he became enmeshed in the Keating Five scandal, a highly visible part of the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s. Charles Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, a subsidiary of his American Continental Corporation, was insolvent as a result of some bad loans. In order to overcome its debt, Lincoln violated direct investment rules by directing accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation into commercial real estate ventures.cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D91230F931A15752C1A96F948260   title=The Lincoln Savings and Loan Investigation: Who Is Involved   publisher=The New York Times   date=1989-11-22  This caught the eye of federal regulators, who were looking to shut Lincoln down.  Keating contacted five senators to whom he made contributions, looking for them to intervene with the regulators on his behalf. 
McCain and Keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981.  Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from Keating and his associates.cite news   url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/35983.html   title=How John McCain Reformed   author=Sullum, Jacob   publisher=Reason magazine Reason   date=2005-03-11   authorlink=Jacob Sullum  In addition, McCain's wife Cindy and her father Jim Hensley had invested $359,100 in a Keating shopping center in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard the American Continental jet.
By March 1987, Keating was asking McCain to travel to meet with regulators regarding Lincoln Savings; McCain refused.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 108111.  Keating called McCain a wimp behind his back, and on March 24 the two had a heated, contentious meeting.  On April 2 and April 9, 1987, McCain and the other senators met at the Capitol with regulators, first with Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and then members of the FHLBB San Francisco branch, to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.  McCain would write in 2002 that attending the two meetings was the worst mistake of my life.McCain and Salter, Worth the Fighting For, p. 161. Used to support direct quotation.
News of the meetings first appeared in National Thrift News in September 1987, but was only sporadically covered by the general media through April 1989.McCain and Salter, Worth the Fighting For, pp. 185186. Used because it has a thorough list of media references to what would become Keating Five.  Towards the end of that period, after learning Keating was in trouble over Lincoln, McCain paid a total of $13,433 for his air trips.cite news   author=Rasky, Susan   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DF1031F931A15751C1A96F948260   title=To Senator McCain, the Savings and Loan Affair Is Now a Personal Demon   publisher=The New York Times   date=1989-12-22

The photograph taken at the time shows, left to right, John McCain, his mother Roberta McCain, his son Jack, his daughter Meghan the ship's maid of honor, and his wife Cindy McCain the ship's sponsor.
The regulators backed off Keating, and Lincoln stayed in business. Still desperate for cash, it convinced customers to replace their federally-insured certificates of deposit with higher-yielding junk bond certificates of American Continental.cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D81131F933A05752C1A96F948260   title= Collapse of Lincoln Savings Leaves Scars for Rich, Poor and the Faithful   author=Nathaniel C. Nash   publisher=The New York Times   date=1989-11-30  In April 1989, Lincoln failed; about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds, and many elderly investors lost their life savings.  Federal regulators filed a $1.1&nbsp;billion civil racketeering and fraud suit against Keating. The five senators came under investigation for attempting to influence the regulators.
In the end, none of the senators was charged with any crime. Instead, the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them.  Robert S. Bennett, who was the special investigator for the committee, wanted to drop any action against McCain and Senator John Glenn, on the grounds of insufficient evidence,cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA133EF93AA1575AC0A966958260   title= Ethics Committee is Urged to Clear 2 of 5 in Savings Inquiry   author=Berke, Richard L.   publisher=The New York Times   date=1990-09-29 but the committee disagreed.cite news   url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/18/AR2008081800698_pf.html   title=Panel Finds 'Credible Evidence' Cranston Violated Ethics Rules   author=Dewar, Helen   publisher=The Washington Post   date=1991-02-08  After public hearings, McCain was mildly rebuked by the committee for exercising poor judgment in intervening with the federal regulators on Keating's behalf,cite news  url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter7.html  title=John McCain Report: The Keating Five  author=Nowicki, Dan and Bill Muller Muller, Bill  publisher=The Arizona Republic  date=2007-03-01  accessdate=2007-11-23 but its 1991 report said that McCain's actions were not improper nor attended with gross negligence and did not reach the level of requiring institutional action against him....Senator McCain has violated no law of the United States or specific Rule of the United States Senate.cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2D71539F93BA15751C0A967958260   title= Excerpts of Statement By Senate Ethics Panel   publisher=The New York Times   date=1991-02-28   accessdate=2008-04-19  In later years, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated a contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target.cite book   last=Tolchin   first=Martin   coauthors=Tolchin, Susan J.   title=Glass Houses: Congressional Ethics and the Politics of Venom   publisher=Westview Press   year=2003   isbn=0813341612 http://books.google.com/books?id=J6KSpXfgDMMC&pg=PA51&dq=%22Keating+Five%22&ei=rYh9SOzkBYa4jgHH57HwDw&sig=ACfU3U0Q8sfOYv0EbjJj0De1KVWyJDiHpQ p. 51.cite book   last=Bennett   first=Robert S.   authorlink=Robert S.

On his Keating Five experience, McCain said: The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do.
The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, for lack of jurisdiction, any possible ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House.cite news   url=http://graphics.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/Pluck_leaks_helped_senator_to_overcome_S_L_scandal+.shtml   title=Pluck, leaks helped McCain to overcome S&L scandal   author=Robinson, Walter V.   publisher=The Boston Globe   date=2000-02-29 The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain was no longer in the House.McCain and Salter, Worth the Fighting For, p. 188. Gives best explanation for House treatment of Keating reimbursements.  It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.  McCain and his staff were suspected of having political leak leaked to the press sensitive information about the investigation that came from some of the closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee.  McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports, and later one of the investigators, concluded that McCain had been one of the main leakers during that time.
McCain survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press.cite news  url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter8.html  title=John McCain Report: Overcoming scandal, moving on  author=Nowicki, Dan and Bill Muller Muller, Bill  publisher=The Arizona Republic  date=2007-03-01  accessdate=2007-11-23  He held a lengthy press conference in which he answered all questions.cite news   url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/10/23/ST2008102300047.html   title=Senator's Image as Reformer Born in Crisis   author=Michael Dobbs   publisher=The Washington Post   date=2008-10-22   accessdate=2008-10-26   authorlink=Michael Dobbs US author  With his blunt manner, he became a frequent guest on television newscasts and talk-oriented news shows, especially once the 1991 Gulf War  which he had voted in favor of  began and his military and POW experience came into demand.  McCain began campaigning against lobbyist money in politics from then on.
McCain's 1992 re-election campaign found his opposition split between Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and impeached and removed former Governor Evan Mecham running as an independent. Although Mecham garnered some hard-core conservative support, Sargent's campaign never gathered momentum and the Keating Five affair did not dominate discussion.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 150151.  Sargent, who had a failed race for the Arizona Legislature in her background, was slow getting her campaign underway and, although 1992 was the Year of the Woman in American politics, failed to get the endorsement of organizations such as Emily's List.  McCain outspent Sargent, $3 million to $350,000.cite news   url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-10-07/news/claire-voyance/   title=Claire-Voyance   author=Silverman, Amy   publisher=Phoenix New Times   date=1999-10-07
McCain again won handily, getting 56&nbsp;percent of the vote to Sargent's 32&nbsp;percent and Mecham's 11&nbsp;percent. McCain's victory put a final end to Mecham's political career. During the same election Arizona finally passed a referendum, which McCain supported,cite news   url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/04/03/mccain-clinton-head-to-memphis-for-mlk-anniversary/   title=McCain, Clinton Head to Memphis for MLK Anniversary   author=Laura Meckler, Nick Timiraos   publisher=The Wall Street Journal   date=2008-04-03   accessdate=2008-04-18

McCain was a co-sponsor of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which enabled disability benefits for Vietnam veterans afflicted with Agent Orange-related diseasesAlexander, Man of the People, p. 251. and established periodic scientific reviews to determine what levels of exposure and diseases would be covered.cite news   url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E7DE1E39F93AA15756C0A960958260   title= Clinton Orders Expanded Agent Orange Benefits for Veterans   author=Todd S.

In 1993 and 1994, McCain voted to confirm President Clinton's nominees Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, whom he considered to be qualified for the Supreme Court despite differing judicial philosophies from his.

McCain was a key member of the 19911993 Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, chaired by Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry, which was convened to investigate the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue: the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. The committee's work included more visits to Vietnam and persuading the Department of Defense to declassify over a million pages of relevant documents.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 152154.  The committee's final report, which McCain endorsed, stated that, While the Committee has some evidence suggesting the possibility a POW may have survived to the present, and while some information remains yet to be investigated, there is, at this time, no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia.cite web  url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1993_rpt/pow-exec.html  title=Report of the Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs  publisher=U.S. Senate  date=1993-01-13  accessdate=2008-01-03  After many years of disliking Kerry due to his actions with Vietnam Veterans Against the War,cite news  url=http://www.boston.com/globe/nation/packages/kerry/062103.shtml  title=At the center of power, seeking the summit  work=John Kerry: A Candidate in the Making  author=Farrell, John Aloysius  publisher=The Boston Globe  date=2003-06-21  accessdate=2008-01-05 McCain developed unbounded respect and admiration for him during the hearings.cite news  title=The Long War of John Kerry  author=Klein, Joe  publisher=The New Yorker  date=2004-01-05  authorlink=Joe Klein

McCain pressed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, partly because it was a time to heal ... it's a way of ending the war; it's time to move on,Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 170171. and partly because he saw it in the U.S. national interest to do so, in particular envisioning Vietnam as a valuable regional counterbalance against China.  In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and McCain, that called for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization.cite news  url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A02E3DC1639F93BA15752C0A962958260  title=Senate Urges End to U.S. Embargo Against Vietnam  author=Greenhouse, Steven  publisher=The New York Times  date=1994-01-28  accessdate=2008-01-06  During his time on the committee and afterward, McCain was vilified as a fraud, traitor, or The Manchurian Candidate 1962 film Manchurian Candidate by some POW/MIA activists who believed that large numbers of American servicemen were still being held against their will in Southeast Asia. They were angry that McCain did not share their belief and that he sought to normalize relations with Vietnam.  McCain's high profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs;Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 187189.  McCain and United States presidential election, 1992 1992 independent presidential candidate Ross Perot, who had helped McCain's wife Carol McCain Carol during her husband's captivity, also had a falling out over the POW/MIA issue, which then extended to Perot blasting McCain's remarriage to Cindy McCain.cite news  url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/94827/output/print  title=When Ross Perot Calls...,  author=Alter, Jonathan  publisher=Newsweek  date=2008-01-16  accessdate=2008-06-09  In return, McCain attacked those he saw as profiteers exploiting the families of those missing in action.
In response to the criticism of the committee's findings, McCain said that he and Kerry had convinced the Vietnamese to give them full access to their records, and that he had spent thousands of hours trying to find real, not fabricated, evidence of surviving Americans.  McCain's push for normalization was opposed by some leading Senate Republicans, including Phil Gramm and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 169170.  In 1995, President Bill Clinton normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam.cite news  url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983202,00.html  title=Good Morning, Vietnam  author=Walsh, James  publisher=Time magazine Time  date=1995-07-24  accessdate=2008-01-05  McCain's and Kerry's visible support during the announcement gave Clinton, who came of age during Vietnam but did not serve in the military, some political cover.
These actions were of a piece with McCain's attitude towards domestic reconciliation from the Vietnam era; unlike many who went to Vietnam some of whom were his best friends, he did not hold grudges against those who did not go.  In 1993 he had offered to escort Clinton on a speaking visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial at a time when some veterans were angrily challenging Clinton's moral right to go there.cite news   url=http://graphics.boston.com/news/politics/campaign2000/news/A_refining_experience.shtml   title='A refining experience'   author=Farrell, John Aloysius   publisher=The Boston Globe   date=2000-01-23  accessdate=2008-06-22  He also struck up a friendship with an anti-war leader, David Ifshin, who had once traveled to Hanoi to make an anti-American propaganda broadcast that McCain had heard in his cell.
A maverick senator
Having survived the Keating Five scandal, McCain made attacking what he saw as the corrupting influence of big money on American politics his signature issue.cite news  url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/specials/mccain/articles/0301mccainbio-chapter9.html  title=John McCain Report: McCain becomes the 'maverick'  author=Nowicki, Dan and Bill Muller Muller, Bill  publisher=The Arizona Republic  date=2007-03-01  accessdate=2007-12-19 
Starting in late 1994 he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform; their McCain-Feingold bill would attempt to put limits on soft money, funds that corporations, unions, and other organizations could donate to political parties, which would then be funneled to political candidates in circumvention of hard money donation limits.  From the start, McCain and Feingold's efforts were opposed by some of the interests targeted, by incumbents in both parties, by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech, and by those who wanted to lessen the power of what they saw as media bias.Timberg, An American Odyssey, p. 190.  On the other hand, it garnered considerable sympathetic coverage in the national media, and from 1995 on, maverick Republican became a label frequently applied to McCain in stories.  He has used the term himself, and one of the chapters in his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For would be titled Maverick.McCain and Salter, Worth the Fighting For, p. 327. Used as self-reference regarding a chapter title.  The first version of the McCain-Feingold Act was introduced into the Senate in September 1995; it was filibustered in 1996 and never came to a vote.cite book  last=Maisel  first=Louis Sandy  coauthors=Kara Z.

He was initially opposed to U.S. military involvement in the Bosnian War, voting against the George H. W. Bush administration on a 1992 resolution that would have authorized demonstrations of force in conjunction with the Operation Provide Promise humanitarian relief effort there.  McCain's view changed after the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre, and he voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the 1995 NATO bombing in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Bosnian Serb Army.
McCain attacked what he saw as pork barrel spending within Congress, believing that the practice did not contribute to the greater national interest.  Towards this end he was instrumental in pushing through approval of the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which gave the president the power to veto individual expenditures. Although this was one of McCain's biggest Senate victories, the effect was short-lived as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional in 1998.cite web  title=Clinton v. City of New York  work=Supreme Court Collection  url=http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-1374.ZS.html  accessdate=July 4, 2005   In a more symbolic attempt to limit congressional privilege, he introduced an amendment in 1994 to remove free VIP parking for members of Congress at D.C. area airports; his annoyed colleagues rejected the notion and accused McCain of grandstanding.

McCain became chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1995, and would hold that position into 1997.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 98.  McCain's visibility was increased by the 1995 publication of Robert Timberg's well-received The Nightingale's Song, a joint biography of five graduates from the Naval Academy who had served in Vietnam and whose subsequent public fame and problems illuminated the role of Vietnam and the military in American life.Alexander, Man of the People, p. 171.  At the start of the United States presidential election, 1996 1996 presidential election, McCain served as national campaign chairman for the highly unsuccessful Republican nomination effort of Texas Senator Phil Gramm.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 173174.  After Gramm dropped out, McCain endorsed eventual nominee Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, and was again on the short list of possible vice-presidential picks.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 176180.  McCain formed a close bond with Dole, based in part on their shared near-death war experiences; he nominated Dole at the 1996 Republican National Convention and was a key friend and advisor to Dole throughout his ultimately losing general election campaign.

In 1997, McCain became chairman of the powerful United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but responded by saying that, Literally every business in America falls under the Commerce Committee and that he restricted those contributions to $1,000 and thus was not part of the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem.  In that year, Time magazine Time magazine named McCain as one of the 25 Most Influential People in America.cite book   last=Utter   first=Glenn H.   coauthors=Strickland, Ruth Ann   title=Campaign and Election Reform   edition=2nd   publisher=ABC-CLIO   year=2008   isbn=159884069X p. 177.  McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs.Alexander, Man of the People, pp. 184187.  The industry spent some $4050&nbsp;million in national advertising in response; while McCain's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain.  During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to banning soft money, it sought to restrict issue ads run by independent groups within 60 days of an election.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 96. While having majority support, it was fiercely opposed by Senator Mitch McConnell on free speech and partisan threat grounds, and it again fell victim to a filibuster and failed to gain cloture.
McCain easily won re-election to a third senate term in November 1998, gaining 69&nbsp;percent of the vote to 27&nbsp;percent for his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger.  Ranger was a motorcycle enthusiast whose Harley-Davidson was painted as the flag of ArizonaAlexander, Man of the People, p. 187. and a political novice who had only recently returned from four years of working and living in Mexico.cite news  url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E3D61F3FF936A35752C1A96E958260  title=The 1998 Elections: State by State  West: Arizona  author=Lewin, Tamar  publisher=The New York Times  date=1998-11-05  accessdate=2007-12-21  McCain carried Democratic stronghold Apache County, Arizona Apache County by 5442&nbsp;percent and won Hispanic votes statewide by 5242&nbsp;percent.Barone and Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2008, p. 100.  McCain took no soft money during the campaign, but still raised $4.4 million for his bid, saying that he had needed it in case the tobacco companies or other Washington special interests mounted a strong effort against him.  One of Ranger's campaigning points had been that McCain was really more interested in running for president; McCain indeed created a presidential exploratory committee the following month.
McCain had been uncomfortable and largely silent during the 1998 Lewinsky scandal, partly because his own personal life had not been without blemishes, and partly because his upcoming presidential nomination run restricted his political options.Timberg, An American Odyssey, pp. 194195.  During the early 1999 Impeachment of Bill Clinton, McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts.  In his remarks on the Senate floor, McCain said: Although I may admit to failures in my private life, I have always kept faith with every oath I have ever sworn to this country. I have known some men who kept that faith at the cost of their lives. I cannot  not in deference to public opinion, or for political considerations, or for the sake of comity and friendship  I cannot agree to expect less from the President.cite news   url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=USA&article=689   title=Holding McCain to his own standard   author=John Nichols   publisher=The Arab American News   date=2008-02-23   accessdate=2008-03-21
During 1999, the McCain-Feingold Act once again came up for consideration, this time with soft money prohibition features in but the issue ads provision out.  McConnell challenged McCain to name specific senators who had been corrupted by existing campaign finance practices, but McCain refused.  In the end, the same failure to gain cloture befell the legislation again.  During that year, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact this campaign finance reform; McCain was cited for opposing his own party on the bill at a time when he was trying to win the party's presidential nomination.cite press release  url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Education+and+Public+Programs/Profile+in+Courage+Award/Award+Recipients/John+McCain/Award+Announcement.htm  title=U.S. Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold Share 10th John F.
