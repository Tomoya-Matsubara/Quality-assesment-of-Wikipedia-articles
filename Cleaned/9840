thumb|Grotto Geyser Grotto Geyser is a fountain type geyser located in the Upper Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, in the United States. Grotto Geyser is the namesake for the group of geysers that includes Grotto Fountain Geyser, South Grotto Fountain Geyser, Indicator Spring, Spa Geyser, and Rocket Geyser.1 Grotto Geyser's oddly shaped cone, which is almost  high, comes from sinter covering dead tree stumps that accumulated as the geyser erupted. The 1870 Washburn expedition named it after this.2
Eruptions
Grotto Geyser erupts about every eight hours. The interval between eruptions is longer after a longer eruption. The eruptions are about  high and can last from about 1 1/2 to more than 10 hours long, although there have been eruptions that lasted more than 26 hours. Its eruptions are usually preceded by an eruption from Grotto Fountain Geyser.34 After it has a short mode eruption, which lasts about 1-2 hours, Rocket Geyser usually has a major eruption. Approximately three-quarters of Grotto's eruptions are short mode. Grotto Geyser and Rocket Geyser erupt together. When Grotto Geyser has a long mode eruption, which lasts from 6-12 hours, Spa Geyser, instead of Rocket Geyser, erupts.5
