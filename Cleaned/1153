We boast not of our merit All credit we disclaim, Our pride is we inherit A fair untarnished name. We&lt;U+2019&gt;ll endeavour to maintain it, while deed and word proclaim Saint Thomas' for ever Saint Thomas' for aye!
In playing field and class room Our heads we&lt;U+2019&gt;ll carry high, We&lt;U+2019&gt;ll yield no shred of honour In loss or victory, Then &lt;U+201C&gt;Vinces&lt;U+201D&gt; be our motto &lt;U+201C&gt;Perseverando&lt;U+201D&gt; cry Saint Thomas&lt;U+2019&gt; forever Saint Thomas&lt;U+2019&gt; for aye!

Her faithful children we, Strong in unity Until one day we prove the Pride of Lanka!
