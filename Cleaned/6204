 The 2006 Manchester, New Hampshire police shooting was an incident that took place on October 16, 2006 in Manchester, New Hampshire, United States. The incident occurred when police officer Michael Briggs was shot while on duty. Briggs was later transported to the hospital before dying of his injuries. The suspect, Michael &quot;Styx&quot; Addison, fled the state of New Hampshire, prompting a manhunt by police. 15 hours after the shooting, Addison was arrested in Dorchester, Massachusetts and was extradited back to New Hampshire.1 Addison was charged with the shooting of Michael Briggs and fleeing police. Addison was transported to the Suffolk County Jail with $2 million (2006 USD) in bail (contrary to other news reports).234 The incident prompted prosecutors to seek the death penalty for Michael Addison, which caused a debate about the place of capital punishment in New Hampshire. 5 Recent news reports indicated that the October 12, 2006 shooting and a string of crimes that occurred a week earlier resulted in two more people connected with Addison were arrested and questioned by authorities.6
A week after the shooting, a memorial service was held on October 21, 2006, and state and local politicians and various charity organizations expressed their condolences to the Briggs family and the community of Manchester. In January 2007, the Manchester Police Department retired Michael Briggs' badge number in honor of the fallen officer. In March 2007 a trial date for Addison was set for early September of 2008.
The capital murder trial of Michael Addison was the first for the state of New Hampshire since Gordon E. Perry was indicted for capital murder charges for the shooting of Officer Jeremy Charron.
Background
Michael Briggs
Michael Briggs (1971-2006) was born in Epsom, New Hampshire, and served in the United States Marines from 1991-1995 after graduating from Pembroke Academy in 1990. From 1995-2001 he worked as a correctional officer and police officer for the Epsom Police Department. On May 2, 2001, Briggs became a police officer for the Manchester Police Department and was assigned as a bicycle police officer. Briggs graduated from the New Hampshire Police Academy in November 2001. In 2004, he received a life-saving medal after saving residents from a burning building. He was awarded the Congressional Law Enforcement Award in October 2005 for the same actions. Briggs was a member of the New Hampshire Police Association and friend and co-worker of Jeremy Charron, who died in 1997. 789
Michael &quot;Styx&quot; Addison
Michael &quot;Styx&quot; Addison (b. 1980) was a resident of Manchester, New Hampshire. Before the October 16, 2006 shooting, Addison had previous run-ins with the police. In 1997, Addison was charged with assault and battery after an armed robbery attempt, that resulted in Addison being sentenced 2-3 years in prison for that crime and three years of probation upon his release on his 21st birthday. In 2000, however, Addison was sentenced to jail again for violating his probation. In October 2003, Addison was arrested in Londonderry, NH, and charged with false imprisonment.10 A month later, Addison pled guilty to criminal restraint, a misdemeanor, in the dispute over drug money. Addison was sentenced to six months in the Rockingham County House of Corrections for that charge.11 In addition, Addison had previous run-ins with Officer Briggs. In 2002, Addison was arrested by Briggs near the Queen City Bridge.12 In March 2003, Addison received first aid by Briggs after a shooting incident.13
Addison is the adopted son of Lucious Addison, a disabled Viet Nam veteran, and was primarily reared by his grandmother in North Carolina.14Many family relatives described him as a loving and responsible parent to his son despite his criminal record. In a 2004 juvenile court case, a paternity test proved that Addison was the father of that child. As of October 2006, the child is currently adopted by someone else.15
October 16, 2006 Shooting
On October 16, 2006, Officer Michael Briggs and his partner John Breckenridge were responding to a domestic disturbance call involving Addison and Antonie Bell-Rodgers. When the two officers spotted the suspects, Briggs ordered them to stop. Bell-Rodgers stopped but Addison continued walking away. When Officer Briggs commanded Addison to stop, Addison turned and shot Briggs. Bell-Rodgers surrendered to police but Addison fled the crime scene. Later, police found Addison's gun and t-shirt.16 In a court reenactment, eyewitnesses claimed that moments before the shooting, they saw a dark gray van and two men jumping out of it and running north towards Lincoln Street where the shooting took place. 17
A manhunt was launched after the shooting, as SWAT teams and local police searched throughout the city of Manchester looking for Addison. A SWAT team showed up at an apartment building where Addison's girlfriend Angela Swist lived and found clothing stained with blood in a bathtub and a bottle of bleach nearby and questioned Swist. Later the police conducted search warrants at two other apartment buildings where they found more evidence.18 The manhunt forced several schools to be placed under lockdown as police and SWAT teams searched vehicles leaving or coming to work or school.19 The search later expanded into Massachusetts after an Internet search revealed Addison's previous address in Massachusetts and police using GPS to track his cell phone calls to an apartment building outside of Boston where Addison was later found by police.202122After a stand-off with police, Addison was soon arrested.2324
Extradition and charges
Addison was extradited back to New Hampshire25 and denied his role in the murder. During a taped interview, Addison told his story six different times before confessing to authorities that he shot at the police officers coming towards him.26 The Manchester District Court charged Addison with capital murder. 27As a result of the charge, prosecutors against Addison sought the death penalty as stated under New Hampshire state law that a murder of a police officer is punishable by death. 28 Later Addison was also charged with armed robbery, conspiracy and felony possession of a firearm in relation to a five day crime spree that started a week before the shooting.29
Investigation and further arrests
An investigation conducted by local officials followed the shooting. During the investigation two women connected to Michael Addison turned themselves in to police after authorities issued warrants&lt;U+2014&gt; for their arrest and the fact that they were accused of robbing a 7-Eleven store five days before the shooting. During an interview with police, one of the women, Angela Swist, told officers that she drove Addison and Anthonie Rodgers to the 7-Eleven on October 11, where Addison and his accomplice robbed the store and fled. She also admitted that she was the driver of the get-away car. 30
Antoine Bell-Rogers, one of the men arrested at the scene of the October 16, 2006 shooting, was charged with firing a handgun at an apartment and felony possession of a firearm but was not charged in connection with the shooting of officer Michael Briggs. A grand jury, however, charged Rodgers with armed robbery and conspiracy after robbing a convenience store five days before the shooting. A bail of $50,000 (2006 USD) was set in October 2006 and was upheld in January 2007.31 On March 5, 2007, Bell-Rodgers asked the court to have his felony charges dropped.32
On March 28, 2007, the Hillsborough County Superior Court re-indicted Bell-Rodgers of the weapons charges after a defense lawyer tried to dismiss Bell-Rodgers original indictment.33 That same day, Teresia Shipley pleaded guilty for the charges of helping Addison robbing a convenience store days before the shooting.34
Trial
New Hampshire State House
November 17, 2006: A pre-trial hearing was conducted, in which police officers told the judge about the shooting on October 16, 2006. The pre-hearing also allowed the officers and Judge William Lyons to place Michael Addison in superior (or state) court based on evidence. 35Some lawyers and legal observers suggested that the trial of Michael Addison could take years. 36
February 16, 2007: Defenders of Michael Addison complained about how the grand jury improperly subpoenaed records and eyewitness testimonies, as court rules stated that state prosecutors cannot present psychological evaluations, juvenile and other records without authorization of the judge.37
February 23, 2007: Addison was indicted on his capital murder charges by a grand jury.3839
February 27,2007: Addison pleaded not guilty of the capital murder charges during the five minute court hearing. Another court hearing was set for March 6.40

March 14, 2007: Kathleen A. McGuire set a date for jury selection for Michael Addison's capital murder trial to be conducted on September 2, 2008. McGuire stated that the trial will start on that date after jury selection.42
March 23, 2007: Attorneys defending Michael Addison planned to contest the use of capital punishment. That plan includes revisiting controversial issues about the law after a previous trial back in 1997 when a man convicted of murdering a police officer escaped the death penalty.43 In addition, the defense attorneys wanted to move Addison's trial to another courthouse that had stricter security in order to prevent the newspaper and television media from taking photographs of Addison while he is in prison and entering or leaving the courthouse. The defense's claim arose from the concern that photographs of Addison would complicate his right to a fair trial.44 The claim was opposed by prosecutors who wanted the trial to remain in Manchester and argued that moving Addison to a different courthouse would interfere with the trial.45 On April 13, 2007, the judge rejected the defense attorneys' request to move Addison's trial hearings to another courthouse on the grounds that the trial of Addison will not impact on jury selection and any images printed by the media would not change Addison's status as they were already published.46
April 27, 2007: Michael Addison was charged with armed robbery in relation of a robbery incident at a restaurant on October 10, 2006 which occurred during a string of crimes and before the October 16 shooting.47
May 31, 2007: Attorneys for Michael Addison stated that the New Hampshire Supreme Court should halt all proceedings due to claims of how the courts handled the death penalty case for Addison. These claims included that the court not impose the death penalty case at all or that it enact certain rules pertaining to how the courts would handle a death sentence.48
Aftermath
Charities
The Manchester Police Patrolman's Association set up a charity fund for the Briggs family after the shooting.49 A charity set up the Portsmouth Police Department raised over $13,000 (2006 USD), while residents of Portsmouth raised over $1,000 (2006 USD).50 The Manchester Monarchs ice hockey team, in partnership with WGIR radio, raised over $55,000 (2006 USD) though auctions. 51The president of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health gave the mayor of Manchester a $5,000 (2006 USD) check during a ceremony.
