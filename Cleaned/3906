&quot;Goodbyeee&quot;, or &quot;Plan F: Goodbyeee&quot;, is the sixth and final episode of the fourth series of the British historical sitcom Blackadder, entitled Blackadder Goes Forth. The episode was first broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before Armistice Day. It was originally the final episode of Blackadder to be produced and transmitted, until the 1999 special Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth.
&quot;Goodbyeee&quot; depicts its main characters' final hours before a charge on the Western Front of the First World War, and Captain Blackadder's failed attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after failing to convince General Melchett, Field Marshal Haig's advice is useless, and he is resigned to take part in the push. In contrast to other episodes in the series, it has a darker theme and no major guest stars, leading up to its acclaimed ending scene in which the main characters die in machine gun fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, whilst unwilling to do so themselves.
The episode was written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, and additional material was provided by its cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going &quot;over the top&quot;, used slow motion because the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending scene. It has often been voted one of the greatest moments in television,1 and has made the episode popular and critically acclaimed.
Plot
Background
Each series of Blackadder depicts its protagonist, always a scheming and (except in the first series)2 witty man named Edmund Blackadder, in various periods throughout history. In Blackadder Goes Forth, he is Captain Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), a soldier in the British Army on the Western Front of the First World War.
Joined by his dimwitted colleagues&lt;U+2014&gt;the poor and unhygienic Private Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and the overly optimistic and upper-class Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie)&lt;U+2014&gt;Blackadder tries constantly to escape from his position and avoid the &quot;big push&quot;, which he fears will mean his death. His efforts are hindered by the brash and assertive General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Melchett's meek, bitter and sycophantic adjutant, Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny).
Events
Captain Blackadder's trench gets a phone call from HQ: a straight assault has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad. Using a method picked up during the colonial wars, he puts his underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils, but his plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method. Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.
Melchett leaves after George declines his offer not to participate in the push, and Baldrick suggests that Blackadder ask Field Marshal Douglas Haig to get them out; remembering that Haig owes him a favour, Blackadder decides to call in the morning. George, Baldrick and Blackadder discuss the war and the friends they have lost. Back at HQ, Melchett surprises Captain Darling with a front-line commission. Melchett misinterprets Darling's pleas to reconsider, and instists that he go.
The following morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and reminds him of his debt; Haig reluctantly tells him to pretend to be mad, and hangs up. Darling arrives, and his enmity with Blackadder dissolves as they are both put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others.
The men are called to the trench to prepare for the big push. There is a brief moment of hope when the British guns stop firing, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that the guns have stopped to avoid shooting their own men. Baldrick has another &quot;cunning plan&quot; to escape, but there is not enough time to hear it.
Blackadder concludes by sincerely wishing his squadmates good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.

The episode's title is a reference to the popular World War I song &quot;Good-bye-ee&quot;, which was composed in 1915 by R. P. Weston and Bert Lee.8 The song had previously been heard in &quot;Major Star&quot;, an earlier episode in the series.
During the filming of the episode, which took place before a live studio audience at BBC Television Centre,9 Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a &quot;knot in the pit of my stomach&quot;.1011 Hugh Laurie said that the filming was sad because &quot;even for comic effect, we were representing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people&quot;.12
The slow motion and fade effects at the end of the episode were not originally scripted,13 but the decision to use them was made in editing after the final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing polystyrene set, ruining the poignancy of the sequence; the episode's director Richard Boden added the poppy field image.14 The episode's end credits were omitted.15 Cast member Tim McInnerny had not known about these changes prior to the episode airing, and has said that he found the ending particularly emotional.16
Themes
The ending shows a field of poppies to reflect upon the deaths of soldiers; it was inspired by John McCrae's poem &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.17|alt=A tranquil field of red poppies, and the text &quot;Blackadder&quot; with a copyright notice.
Blackadder, Baldrick and George discuss the futility of war&lt;U+2014&gt;George mentions the Christmas truce of 1914, in which the belligerents stopped fighting to play football&lt;U+2014&gt;and their impending fate. George lists the members of the &quot;Trinity Tiddlers&quot;, the group that he signed up with, and realises that he is the only one of them still alive; this is paralleled in Baldrick's pets, who have all died.
Blackadder makes numerous sarcastic comments regarding General Melchett's safety compared to the almost certain death of those on the front line. Field Marshall Haig is shown casually sweeping away toy soldiers with a dustpan and brush, in reference to the indifference of those in command when sending infantrymen to their deaths. The series, and the storyline of &quot;Goodbyeee&quot; especially, often depicts the &quot;lions led by donkeys&quot; perception of the war, an element which has been criticised by historians.1819
Comparing the ending scene to those of previous series of Blackadder in which the main characters were also killed, writer Richard Curtis commented that &quot;I think it was by chance that [previous series] ended with Blackadder being killed [...] but series four, we did do it very much on purpose.&quot; He said that he and Elton felt that they could use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering that &quot;if we did do that [...] it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War&quot;.20
Reception
Following its original broadcast on BBC One at 9:30Â pm on Thursday 2 November 1989,21 the episode was praised for its powerful and memorable ending, which met with critical acclaim.22 One journalist called the scene &quot;a classy ending to a TV classic&quot;,23 and The Sunday Times said that it was &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;properly responsible&quot; of the writers to end the series poignantly, especially when the episode aired close to Remembrance Day.24
The episode has also featured in more recent reviews; Rob Cromwell of The Guardian listed the final scene among six &quot;perfect end-of-show finales&quot;, saying of Blackadder Goes Forth: &quot;It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds&quot;, and praising the writers and producer John Lloyd for &quot;deliver[ing] a perfectly pitched, poignant ending&quot;.25 The series overview from UKTV's channel Gold, which airs repeats of Blackadder, calls the final episode &quot;a seamless blend of gallows humour and rich poignancy&quot;, and &quot;a fitting end to an iconic series&quot;.26
In a poll conducted by Channel 4 and The Observer to determine the one hundred most memorable moments in television, the final scene of &quot;Goodbyeee&quot; came ninth; it was the only entry in the top ten, except for a scene from Only Fools and Horses, that was not news coverage.27 The British Film Institute's Screenonline called the episode's ending &quot;unexpectedly moving&quot;, and noted that, unusually for a comedy programme, it was repeated as part of a serious commemoration of Armistice Day.28 In his segment advocating for Blackadder to be voted Britain's Best Sitcom, broadcaster and journalist John Sergeant called the final sequence &quot;the one sitcom moment with claims to immortality&quot;.29
