The Sarayk&lt;U+00F6&gt;y Nuclear Research and Training Center (), known as SANAEM, is a nuclear research and training center of Turkey. The organization was established on July 1, 2005 as a subunit of Turkish Atomic Energy Administration (, TAEK) at Kazan district in northwest of Ankara on an area of .1
The center can be visited for technical purposes upon application.2

Electron accelerator facility
The electron accelerator is the only one in the country. It has 500 KeV energy and 20 mA current.6
Proton accelerator facility
The country's first proton accelerator facility (, TAEK-PHT) is housed in a separate building of two stories built on a ground area of . The building consists of a cyclotron room, four target rooms, six production laboratories, three quality control laboratories, a R&amp;D laboratory and storage rooms for material and waste.7
Facility's groundbreaking was held on February 24, 2010. The building was constructed by the Turkish Housing Development Administration (TOK&lt;U+0130&gt;), and it was completed on December 12, 2010. The installation of the proton accelerator and all the equipment needed concluded in 2011.8 The facility was officially opened on May 30, 2012 by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo&lt;U+011F&gt;an.910
The cyclotron type proton accelerator &quot;CYCLONE-30&quot; has a variable beam energy between 15 and 30 MeV and variable beam current up to 1.2 mA. It was designed, manufactured and installed by Belgian Ion Beam Applications S.A. (IBA).11 The cyclotron cost 11.6 million EUR.12
With the cyclotron, four beamlines can be generated, three beamlines for radiositope production and one for research and development works.1314 With the proton bombardment following radioisotopes are produced in three separate target rooms:
Indium-111, Gallium-67, Thallium-201 on solid target material,
Fluorine-18 on liquid target material,
Iodine-123 on evaporated target material.15
These radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals produced from those radioisotopes are used for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases like cancer, neurological disorder, brain physiology and pathology as well as coronary artery disease.16
By producing radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, the facility conducts research work in the fields of medicine, industry, agriculture, food, biotechnology, animal husbandry and heath physics.17
