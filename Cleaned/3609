Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock are two prominent volcanic plateaus located just north of the Rogue River in Jackson County, Oregon. Created by an andesitic lava flow approximately seven million years ago and shaped by erosion, they now stand about  above the surrounding valley. The Table Rocks are jointly owned; The Nature Conservancy is responsible for , while the Bureau of Land Management is responsible for .
The Takelma tribe of Native Americans inhabited the Table Rocks for at least 15,000 years. Starting in the mid 1800s during a gold rush, European American settlers forced the Takelma out of the Table Rocks and into reservations. The area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were not protected until the 1970s.
The rocks are home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which includes over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill during the rainy season in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The Dwarf Woolly Meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the rocks have been listed as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management since 1984.
The Table Rocks are one of the most popular hiking locations in the Rogue Valley, with over 10,000 visitors annually. Two trails, Lower Table Rock Trail and Upper Table Rock Trail, were cut across the plateaus in the early 1980s by the Youth Conservation Corps, Boy Scouts, and the Oregon Department of Forestry.
The plateaus are named Table Rocks because of their relatively flat tops. Upper and Lower refer to their location along the Rogue River, not their height. Upper Table Rock,  above sea level at its highest point, is located upstream, while Lower Table Rock is farther downstream, with an elevation of .
Geology and climate
Lower Table Rock across the Rogue Valley from Roxy Ann Peak|alt=Vegetation in the foreground, with a flat area scattered with buildings farther away. The plateau is far away, with mountains by the horizon.
Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene,1 a braided river system called the &quot;Ancestral Rogue River&quot; flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved.2 For about 2.1 million years,3 the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone.456 Between 20 and 10 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley.7 Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about  of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.8
Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44 mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley.910 This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation.11 At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of  and thinned to about  to the north of Medford.
Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the lava.1213 Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand  above the valley floor,14 and just over  above sea level.15 There are approximately  of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and  on Upper Table Rock.16 Expansive talus fields now surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting both plant and animal life.17
The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted topography, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion of the surrounding region.1819 Each plateau is shaped roughly like a horseshoe because the lava followed the meanders of the Ancestral Rogue River.202122
 Two caves and two former gold mines are located at the base of the andesite cap on Upper Table Rock. The caves were created by natural fractures in the cap, and the gold mines were excavated by prospectors searching for gold in the 19th century. Three are large enough to walk into, with an average width of , while one is a small pit, dropping  vertically into a pond of water.23
Human history
Humans have been living in the Table Rock area for at least 15,000 years, based on the age of Clovis points that were discovered in the region.24 The area surrounding the Table Rocks was home to the Takelma people. They gathered food such as acorns and tarweed seeds, and caught salmon in the nearby Rogue River. The Takelma also used deer hides for clothing.25 They had several names for the rocks, including Di'tani (rock above), Titanakh (little Indian plums), and possibly Kwenphunkh.2627 The first use of the names Upper Table Rock and Lower Table Rock is unknown, however the first recorded use was in mountain man James Clyman's journal in 1845.2829
 Some of the first European Americans to visit the area were fur trappers lead by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827.3031 In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Rogue Valley. Neither mentioned the Table Rocks.32 The gold rush of the early 1850s brought many emigrants to the area, and Table Rock City (later renamed Jacksonville) was built nearby.333435 The sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with the Rogue River Indians. This turned into warfare, and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end the hostilities.3637 In June 1851, soldiers of the United States Army lead by Major Philip Kearny attacked the Takelma near Lower Table Rock, but the Takelma were prepared. Three of the soldiers were injured, and one died. Major Kearny returned with volunteers from Yreka, accompanied by Joseph Lane. The ensuing Battle of Table Rock lasted 10 days, and 30 Takelma were imprisoned.38
In September 1853, the Native Americans signed a peace treaty with Joseph Lane, and the Treaty with the Rogue River with Joel Palmer, which resulted in their ceding  of land for $60,000.39 The Takelma population underwent their first forced migration into the Table Rock Reservation, located between Upper Table Rock and nearby Evans Creek.404142 This Indian reservation remained open for three years,4344 while the inhabitants were moved to other reservations.4546 In January 1856, 400 Indians were moved to the Grande Ronde Reservation. Most of the rest were relocated to the Siletz Reservation in May.47
Development of the area commenced immediately and in 1872 the Table Rock Post Office was established just south of Upper Table Rock and east of Lower Table Rock.4849 The Table Rock School District was created in 1879.50 In 1895 the post office's name was changed to Tablerock, and it was closed in 1906.5152 Telephones arrived in 1908, and the Table Rock Mutual Telephone Company was established. The school district was merged with Central Point's district in 1948.53
In November 1948, John Day, a local cattle rancher and developer, built a  airstrip on the surface of Lower Table Rock to impress visiting celebrities from Hollywood. Day funded residential lots near the landmark with the intent of marketing the lots to the celebrities who used the grassy runway.5455 The runway was closed in the late 1980s, but small airplanes still occasionally attempt to land on it.5657
 The Federal Aviation Administration has operated a  tall very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower on Upper Table Rock since the 1960s.5859 The purpose of the tower is to broadcast precise coordinates to nearby aircraft to assist in navigation. The facility is closed to the public due to the threat to the safety of the occupants of the aircraft. However, the structure sustained $40,000 worth of damage in 1997 when vandals unsuccessfully attempted to steal aluminum antennas from the  tall fiberglass shell on the roof of the building.60
The Nature Conservancy became concerned about overdevelopment in 1978 and launched its largest fundraising project to that date. Raising over $500,000, they purchased  of Lower Table Rock, creating the Lower Table Rock Preserve.61 Projects include prescribed burning and invasive species removal.62 In 1981, the Upper Table Rock Trail was built by the Youth Conservation Corps. A year later, the Lower Table Rock Trail was constructed. The first  of the trail were built by a Central Point Boy Scout troop, while the rest was built by the Oregon Department of Forestry.63 In 1984, the Table Rocks were designated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management.6465 In May 2009, The Nature Conservancy bought another  of land on the Table Rocks for $3.9 million, ending private ownership of the rocks.66
Ecological habitats
 Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil.6768 Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.
Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers.6970 Some of the most common wildflowers are buttercups, desert parsley , Bicolor Lupine, and California Goldfields.7172 Camas and Death Camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while the Death Camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.73
More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks.74 Lizards such as the Western Fence Lizard, Southern Alligator Lizard, and Western Skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western Rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions.757677 Black-tailed Deer, Coyotes, and Bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to ticks , although they are mainly found in the chaparral region.7879 Many species of birds live on the rocks.8081
The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than , and the annual precipitation is approximately  due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.82
Oak savanna
 Oak savanna is a type of grassland scattered with oak trees, found on the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. Fires were often set in the oak savanna and chaparral regions by the Takelma tribe to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and Elk. It also prevented large wildfires.83 White Oak and Ponderosa Pine are the most common trees found in the region.8485 Buckbrush, Manzanita, Pacific Madrone, Deerbrush, Mountain Mahogany, and Poison-oak are also common.868788
Snakes such as the Ringneck Snake, Western Yellow-bellied Racer, Striped Whipsnake, and Gopher Snake live in the oak savanna region.899091 Birds such as titmice, flycatchers, nuthatches, bluebirds, swallows, woodpeckers, grosbeaks, and kestrels have also been found in this region.929394 The rocks are known to be the northernmost place Blue-gray Gnatcatchers inhabit.959697 Gall wasps live in this area, often forming galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into the leaves.98
Chaparral
Chaparral is a type of shrubland, receiving very little precipitation. Sclerophyllous plants such as manzanita and buckbrush grow in this area, both relying on fire to reproduce.99100101 The rare Gentner's frittilary also grows in this region.102
Black bears have been spotted in the chaparral region, usually in the fall.103 The most common birds include titmice and the Acorn Woodpecker. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, goldfinches, and the Anna's Hummingbird have also been seen.104105106
Mixed woodland
The mixed woodland region is a dense forest with many species of trees, located near the tops of the plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. Black Oak, Douglas-fir, Pacific Madrone, Incense-cedar, and other plants grow in the mixed woodland.107108109 Shrubs such as Oregon-grape, honeysuckle, elderberry , and Poison-oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.110111
Rodents such as the California Ground Squirrel, Western Gray Squirrel, and Dusky-footed Woodrat live in this region.112113114 Birds such as grosbeaks, flycatchers, tanagers, and buntings are common in the area. Nine species of warblers, three species of vireos, and two species of thrushes can also be found. The Pileated Woodpecker has been spotted rarely in large pine trees.115116117
Mounded prairie and vernal pools
 The mounded prairie region is located on top of the plateaus, characterized by many species grasses and wildflowers around the vernal pools, with mounds of soil created by erosion. The Dwarf Woolly Meadowfoam, a plant endemic to the Table Rocks, grow near these pools.118119120 They bloom for about ten days in April.121 When filled, the pools are also a known habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp (Branchinecta lynchi), a threatened species, which are found in the winter and early spring.122123
Two types of amphibians are found in the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools. The Pacific Tree Frog live in large numbers on the rocks, while tadpoles of the rarer Western Toad can be seen between March and May.124125 Mammals such as California Voles, Heermann's Kangaroo Rats, raccoons, and weasels can also be found in this region.126127 The Western Meadowlark and two species of sparrows are the most common types of birds that are seen in the area. Turkey Vultures, Rock Wren, three species of hawks, and other birds patrol the cliffs on the sides of the plateaus.128129130
Trails
 The Table Rocks offer one of the most popular hiking locations in the Rogue Valley, with over 10,000 visitors annually.131132 Over 4,600 people per year participate in guided hikes through the Table Rock Environmental Education Program, hosted by the Bureau of Land Management and The Nature Conservancy.133 Upper Table Rock features a walking trail which climbs approximately  to the top of the plateau over . Lower Table Rock also has a walking trail,  long, ascending approximately .134135 It has eight interpretive panels along its length, explaining the history, flora, and fauna of the region. The trails are the most popular with hikers between March and May, when the wildflowers are in bloom. Another peak occurs in September through October.136 Landmarks such as Mount McLoughlin, Mount Ashland, Roxy Ann Peak, and Pilot Rock are visible from the edge of the rocks.137138
 The Youth Conservation Corps, Boy Scouts, and the Oregon Department of Forestry built the trails leading to the tops of the Table Rocks in the early 1980s, around the same time the plateaus were being nominated as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern.139140 In June 1999, only two small trees were cut when Shady Cove contractor Randy Hodges rerouted a  section of the Lower Table Rock trail to accommodate the growing number of visitors. The project involved decommissioning the old section and expanding the parking lot, and  of new trail was installed. Measures to protect the trail were implemented, such as installing rock waterbars and a layer of shale gravel over the clay.141
In 2005, a program to build an interpretive trail began on Lower Table Rock near the trailhead. Prior to construction, some persons with disabilities, children, or the elderly may have been prevented from using either of the Table Rocks due to the steep terrain and narrow paths. The finished project involved making a  section of trail accessible and adding a  long section of new trail for general public use.142
Both trails lead to spectacular views of the surrounding areas,143 but have inherent dangers as well. The thick andesite caps have heavily eroded, leaving tall crumbling columns near the edges. In April 2007 a 22-year-old Medford man fell to his death while climbing.144 Another man fell  in 2007, but survived.145 In 2008, a man from Central Point tumbled through a rock shaft to his death and was not found for over six months.146
