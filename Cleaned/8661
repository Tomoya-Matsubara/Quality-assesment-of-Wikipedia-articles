Texas Tech University alumni and former students have gone on to prominent careers in government, business, science, medicine, education, sports, and entertainment.
History
 The call to open a college in West Texas began shortly after the arrival of settlers in the area in the 1880s.12 In 1917, the Texas legislature passed a bill creating a branch of Texas A&amp;M to be located in Abilene.3 However, the bill was repealed two years later during the next session after it was discovered that Governor James E. Ferguson had falsely reported the site committee's choice of location. After new legislation passed votes in the state house and senate in 1921, Governor Pat Neff vetoed it, citing hard financial times in West Texas. Furious about Neff's veto, some in West Texas went so far as to recommend that West Texas secede from the state.4
In 1923, the legislature decided that, rather than a branch campus, an entirely new university system would better serve the needs of the region.5 On February 10, 1923, Neff signed the legislation creating Texas Technological College, and in July of that year a committee began searching for a site.6 When the members of the committee visited Lubbock, they were overwhelmed to find residents lining the streets to show support for the idea of hosting the institution.78 That August, Lubbock was chosen on the first ballot over other area towns, including Floydada, Plainview, and Sweetwater.9
Construction of the college campus began on November 1, 1924.10 Ten days later, the cornerstone of the Administration Building was laid in front of a crowd of twenty thousand people. Governor Pat Neff, Amon G. Carter Reverend E. E. Robinson, Colonel E. O. Thompson, and Representative R. M. Chitwood spoke at the event.11 With an enrollment of 914 students&lt;U+2014&gt;both men and women&lt;U+2014&gt;Texas Technological College opened for classes on October 1, 1925.121314 It was originally composed of four schools&lt;U+2014&gt;Agriculture, Engineering, Home Economics, and Liberal Arts.15
Texas Tech grew slowly in the early years. Military training was conducted at the college as early as 1925, but formal ROTC training did not commence until 1936. By 1939, the school's enrollment had grown to 3,890. Though enrollment declined during World War II, Texas Tech trained 4,747 men in its armed forces training detachments.16 Following the war, in 1946, the college saw its enrollment leap to 5,366 from a low of 1,696 in 1943.17  By the 1960s, the school had expanded its offerings to more than just technical subjects.18 The Faculty Advisory Committee suggested changing the name to &quot;Texas State University&quot;, feeling the phrase &quot;Technological College&quot; was insufficient to define the scope of the institution.19 While most students supported this change, the Board of Directors and many alumni, wanting to preserve the Double-T logo, opposed it.20 Other names&lt;U+2014&gt;University of the Southwest, Texas Technological College and State University,21 and The Texas University of Art, Science and Technology&lt;U+2014&gt;were considered,22 but the Board of Directors chose Texas Tech University, submitting it to the state legislature in 1964. A failed move by Governor John Connally to have the school placed into the Texas A&amp;M University System, as well as continued disagreement and heated debate regarding the school's new name, kept the name change from being approved.2324 In spite of objections by many students and faculty, the Board of Directors again submitted the change in 1969. It finally received the legislature's approval on June 6 and the name Texas Tech University went into effect that September.25 All of the institution's schools, except Law, became colleges.2627
The university was integrated for in 1961 when three African-American students were admitted. After its initial rejection of the students' enrollment and the threat of a subsequent lawsuit, the university enacted a policy to admit &quot;all qualified applicants regardless of color&quot;.28 In 1967, the face of the Red Raiders football team was forever changed when the university offered its first athletic scholarship to a black student, Danny Hardaway.29 Texas Tech reached another milestone in 1970 when Hortense W. Dixon became the first African-American student to earn a doctorate from the university.30
During the same time period&lt;U+2014&gt;the 1960s and 1970s&lt;U+2014&gt;the university invested US$150 million in the campus to construct buildings for the library, foreign languages, social sciences, communications, philosophy, electrical and petroleum engineering, art, and architecture. Some other buildings were significantly expanded.31 On May 29, 1969, the 61st Texas Legislature created the Texas Tech University School of Medicine.32 The Texas Legislature expanded the medical school charter in 1979, creating the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. TTUHSC, which is now part of the Texas Tech University System, includes Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. It has locations in four Texas cities in addition to the main campus in Lubbock.33  In 1996, the Texas Tech Board of Regents created the Texas Tech University System. John Montford was selected as the first chancellor to lead the combined academic enterprise.34 Regents Chair Edward Whitacre, Jr., stated that the move was made due to the size and complexity of the institution. &quot;It's time&quot;, he said, &quot;to take the university into the 21st century...&quot;35 The Texas Tech University system originally included Texas Tech University and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. On November 6, 2007, the Texas Legislature ratified an amendment to the Texas Constitution re-aligning Angelo State University with the Texas Tech University System.36 Kent Hance, a former United States Congressman and Texas Tech University graduate, assumed the duties of chancellor on December 1, 2006.37
Even though growth continued at Texas Tech, the university was not immune to controversy. In 2003, a third-year student at the Texas Tech School of Law filed suit against the university over its policy on free speech zones, which restricted student speech to a single &quot;free speech gazebo&quot;.38 The following year, a federal judge declared the policy unconstitutional.394041
To meet the demands of its increased enrollment and expanding research, the university has invested more than $548 million in new construction since 2000. It has also received more than $65.9 million in private donations.42 Although it is not currently a flagship university of the State of Texas, Texas State Senator Kirk Watson is conducting a study to explore the possibility of expanding the number of Texas state flagships. Texas Tech is a leading candidate for inclusion in such an expansion.4344 {{-}}

 Classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a research university with &quot;high activity&quot;,74 Texas Tech University hosts 60 research centers and institutes.75 In 2008, a team of researchers from Texas Tech University and Harvard University developed a siRNA-based treatment that may ultimately counteract HIV. Human cells infected with the HIV, injected into rats, have been cured by the experimental treatment. Clinical trials on humans are expected to begin by 2010.767778 Texas Tech researchers also hold the exclusive license for HemoTech, a human blood substitute composed of bovine hemoglobin. HemoBioTech, the company marketing the technology, believes that HemoTech will diminish the intrinsic toxicities that have stifled previous attempts to develop a human blood substitute.79 On January 14, 2008, Texas Tech University announced the creation of the West Texas Influenza Research Center. The university has concluded human clinical testing of oral interferon in a five-year study of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and continues its study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.80
Following a May 11, 1970, tornado that caused 26 fatalities and over $100 million in damage in Lubbock, the Wind Science and Engineering Research Center (WISE) was established. The WISE Center, which includes  of indoor laboratory space, is focused on research, education, and information outreach.81 The interdisciplinary research program studies methods to exploit the beneficial qualities of wind and to mitigate its detrimental effects. The Center offers education in wind-science and engineering to develop professionals who are experts in creating designs which deal effectively with problems caused by high winds. WISE Center researchers contributed significantly to the development of the Enhanced Fujita Scale for rating the strength of tornadoes.82
 Texas Tech has made numerous contributions to NASA projects. Daniel Cooke, Computer Science Department Chair, and his colleagues are working to develop the technical content of the Intelligent Systems Program, and have been awarded a five-year budget valued at $350 million.83 University scientists have also teamed with NASA's guidance, navigation, and control engineers to develop the Onboard Abort Executive (OAE), software capable of quickly deciding the best course of action during an ascent failure.8485 The Texas Tech Space Research Initiative has also partnered with NASA to perfect methods for growing fresh vegetables in space and to determine the most efficient ways to recycle wastewater.86 In November 1996, the university dedicated the Charles A. Bassett II Pulse Laboratory to honor engineering alumnus and Gemini-era astronaut Charles A. Bassett II.87 In total, Texas Tech has helped to produce four astronauts: Bassett, Bernard A. Harris, Jr., Paul Lockhart, and Rick Husband, the final commander of space shuttle Columbia.8889

Athletics
Texas Tech's men's athletic teams are known as the Red Raiders. The women's athletic teams are known as the Lady Raiders. Texas Tech competes in NCAA Division I-A and is a member of the South Division of the Big 12 Conference. From 1932 until 1956, the university belonged to the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association. After being rejected eight times over a period of more than twenty years, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference on May 12, 1956.128 When the Southwest Conference disbanded in 1995, Texas Tech, along with the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&amp;M University, and Baylor University, merged with the Big 8 Conference to form the Big 12.129
 Of its varsity sports, Texas Tech's womens' basketball team has been the only one to claim a national title. The Lady Raiders, led by player Sheryl Swoopes and head coach Marsha Sharp, won the 1993 NCAA Women's Basketball Championship.130 The men's basketball team has made 14 appearances in the NCAA Men's Division I Tournament. Bob Knight served as men's basketball coach from the beginning of the 2001 season until February 4, 2008. On January 1, 2007, he became the winningest coach in men's NCAA Division I basketball history, when the Red Raiders defeated the New Mexico Lobos, 70&lt;U+2013&gt;68.131 Upon Knight's retirement, his son Pat Knight became the head coach of the team.132
Since 1999, home basketball games have been played at United Spirit Arena, a 15,020-seat multi-purpose facility which cost $62 million to build.133 In addition to serving as home to the men's and women's basketball teams, the arena is used by the Lady Raiders volleyball team.
The Red Raiders football team, coached by Mike Leach since 2000, is a member of the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly known as Division I-A). In each of its last twelve seasons Tech has finished with a winning record, the fifth-longest such streak in the nation.134 The Red Raiders have made 31 bowl appearances, which is 19th most of any university.135 From 1932 to 1956, as members of the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the Red Raiders won eight conference championships and one co-championship. After joining the Southwest Athletic Conference, the Red Raiders added conference co-championships in 1976 and 1994.136  Jones AT&amp;T Stadium serves as home to the Red Raiders football team. The stadium, named for Clifford B. and Audrey Jones, opened in 1947. In 2000, the stadium was renamed Jones SBC Stadium after SBC Communications made a $30 million contribution to the university. Following SBC Communications' acquisition of AT&amp;T Corporation in 2006, the stadium was renamed Jones AT&amp;T Stadium.137 The stadium's original seating capacity was 27,000, but it was expanded in 1959, 1972, and again in 2003 to the current capacity of 53,000. On August 7, 2008, the Texas Tech Board of Regents announced a $25 million expansion project.138 The planned expansion will add a Spanish Renaissance themed facade to the east side of the stadium. In addition to the improvements to the exterior of the facility, the expansion with add 1,000 general-admission seats, 550 club seats, and 26 suits.139 Texas Tech has allocated a total of $19 million to the expansion and plans to add another $6 million through fund-raising initiatives. Construction is set to begin following the 2008 season.140
The Red Raiders baseball team played its first game in 1925.141 The team has two conference championships, two conference tournament championships, and has made nine NCAA Division I Baseball Championship tournament appearances.142 Larry Hays coached the team from 1987 to 2008 and lead the team to a .639 winning percentage.143 Following Hays&lt;U+2019&gt; retirement on June 2, 2008, Assistant Coach Dan Spencer was promoted to head coach.144 At least 20 former Red Raiders baseball players have gone on to play in the Major Leagues. 145 The team plays its home games at Dan Law Field. The field, located on the main campus in Lubbock, has a seating capacity of 5,050.146
In addition to varsity sports, the university offers polo, rugby union, lacrosse, fencing, soccer, ice hockey, and other activities through campus intramural sports organizations. In 2006, Texas Tech beat rival Texas A&amp;M to win the United States Polo Association National Intercollegiate Championship.147148149 {{-}}
Mascots
 The Masked Rider is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot. The tradition began in 1936, when &quot;ghost riders&quot; were dared to circle the field Starting at the beginning of home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the Gator Bowl. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the Atlanta Journal who witnessed the event, later wrote, &quot;No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.&quot;150151
Today the Masked Rider, with guns up, leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive gaucho hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech. Ashley Hartzog, a senior animal science and Spanish major from Farwell, Texas, will represent the university as the Masked Rider during 2008/09.152
 Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.153 Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.154 The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders. {{-}}
Traditions
Double T spirit logo
 The most readily identified symbol of Texas Tech is the Double T logo. The logo, generally attributed to Texas Tech's first football coach, E. Y. Freeland, was first used as decoration on the sweaters for the football players.155 The Double T existed in its original form as an official logo from 1963 to 1999 and was updated in 2000. The new logo maintains the original premise but incorporates three-dimensional bevelling effects coupled with white trim.
To recognize the importance of the Double T to Texas Tech, the class of 1931 donated the Double T bench. Per tradition, freshmen are not allowed to sit on the bench, which is currently located in the courtyard of the Administration Building. The logo is further embodied in the Double T neon sign, donated by the class of 1938 and affixed to the east side of Jones AT&amp;T Stadium. At the time of its purchase, this was reputedly the largest neon sign in existence.156 {{-}}
Texas Tech ring
 While the class ring had occasionally used a universal design, by the late 20th century various styles were available. In 1999, the university reverted to a single ring design for the university's graduates. The new Official Texas Tech Alumni Association Class Ring symbolically captures the essence of Texas Tech with the prominent Double T logo surrounded by the school&lt;U+2019&gt;s full name and date of foundation. By tradition, undergraduates wear the ring with the Double T logo facing themselves. Upon graduation, the ring is turned so the logo faces outward.
One shoulder of the ring displays an image of the Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.157
Will Rogers and Soapsuds
One of the most well-known landmarks on campus is the statue of Will Rogers on his horse Soapsuds. The statue has resided at the center of the campus since it was dedicated on February 16, 1950 by Rogers' longtime friend Amon G. Carter.158 Carter claimed that Texas Tech was the ideal setting for the statue and that it would be an appropriate addition to the traditions and scenery of West Texas.159 The statue, estimated to cost (in 1950) $25,000, stands 9 feet 11 inches (3 m) and weighs 3,200 pounds (1,450 kg).160 The inscription on the plaque at the base of the statue reads: &quot;Lovable Old Will Rogers on his favorite horse, 'Soapsuds', riding into the Western sunset.&quot;161
 According to one legend, the statue was originally to be positioned with Will Rogers facing due west, so that it would appear he was riding into the sunset. However, that position would cause Soapsuds' posterior to face due east, towards the main entrance of the school. The horse's rear would also be facing downtown Lubbock, potentially insulting the Lubbock business community. To solve this problem, the statue was turned 23 degrees to the northwest so Soapsuds' rear would face southeast in the general direction of College Station, Texas, home of rival Texas A&amp;M University. Before every home football game, the Saddle Tramps wrap the statue with red crepe paper. In times of national tragedies, the statue has also been wrapped in black crepe paper.162 {{-}}

The University of Texas System has four medical schools, but none are located in Austin, the site of its flagship campus and only law school. Neither the Texas A&amp;M University System nor the University of North Texas System has a law school, and the University of Houston System has no medical school. Baylor University has only a law school, which is located in Waco. Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, has not been part of Baylor University since 1969. Baylor also operates the Baylor University Medical Center, which is a hospital system.↩
