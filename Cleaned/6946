Captain Jack Harkness is a fictional character played by John Barrowman in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who and its spin-off series Torchwood. He first appears in the 2005 Doctor Who episode &quot;The Empty Child&quot; and reappears throughout the rest of the 2005 series as a companion of the ninth incarnation of the series' protagonist, &quot;the Doctor&quot;. Jack goes on to become the central character in Torchwood, an adult-themed spin-off of Doctor Who. He returns in the 2007 series of Doctor Who, reuniting with a tenth incarnation of the Doctor, and is set to return again for the 2008 series.
In the programme's narrative, Jack is a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century. A bisexual, he is the first openly non-heterosexual character in the history of Doctor Who. His real name is unknown; he is commonly called &quot;Captain Jack&quot; or &quot;the Captain&quot;. As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 series finale of Doctor Who, the character becomes immortal, a lasting change throughout his appearances in both series.
Appearances
Television
Jack's character history is presented simultaneously in Doctor Who and Torchwood, as well as through flashbacks and exposition which relay his backstory. These events reveal that Jack was once a prisoner of war,1 and later a 51st century Time Agent,2 before being introduced on Doctor Who as a con artist.3 Partnered with another Time Agent, Jack was a nefarious character who went from planet to planet pilfering everything he could.4
Jack first appeared in the two-parter episodes &quot;The Empty Child&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Dances&quot; of the 2005 series of Doctor Who. The Doctor's (Christopher Eccleston) companion Rose (Billie Piper) meets him during the London Blitz in 1941, where he is posing as an American volunteer in the Royal Air Force, with the rank of Group Captain. Jack is revealed to be a con man who is unwittingly responsible for releasing a plague, but redeems himself by saving everyone from a German bomb.56 Afterwards, he accompanies the Doctor for several adventures in his time machine, the TARDIS,789 and the character transforms from the con man he was into a hero.10 In his final 2005 appearance in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, set on the futuristic space station Satellite 5, Jack is killed opposing the Daleks; Rose brings him back to life while suffused with the power of the time vortex.11 He is then left behind by the Doctor and Rose, who depart Satellite 5 in the TARDIS. The decision behind Jack's absence in the 2006 series of Doctor Who was so that the effects of the Doctor's regeneration on Rose could be explored.12
The character returned in 2006 as the star of spin-off series, titled Torchwood, now leading the Cardiff-based organisation Torchwood dedicated to protecting Britain from alien threats. In the series, Jack is a changed man,13 having become immortal after his resurrection and spent years on Earth waiting to reunite with the Doctor. How he arrived in the present day from Satellite 5 is not explained. Jack recruits policewoman Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to his team; there are hints of romance between them,14 as well as between Jack and existing employee Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd).15 Despite having worked with him for some time, his present-day colleagues know very little about him;16 over the course of the season they discover that he cannot die, and that &quot;Jack Harkness&quot; is not in fact his true name, but an alias taken from a deceased WWII soldier.1718 After the Torchwood Series 1 finale &quot;End of Days&quot;,19 Jack returns to Doctor Who, which sees Jack reunite with the Doctor (David Tennant) and his new companion, Martha (Freema Agyeman). &quot;Utopia&quot;, the first of a three-episode arc featuring long-time Doctor Who villain the Master (John Simm), shows Jack learning the origin of his immortality and reveals that he returned from Satellite 5 to the present day by travelling to 1869 via vortex manipulator and living throughout the entire 20th century.20 In the story's denouement, the character's search for the Doctor is over, and after having spent a year in an alternate timeline, he is offered full-time companionship in the TARDIS, but declines, opting to stay with his team in Cardiff.21
In 2008, Torchwood series two began with Jack returning to his team to find they have moved on without him, with Gwen having learned to lead the team. Returning with a new attitude,22 Jack finds his team more insistent to learn of his backstory after meeting his former partner, Captain John Hart (James Marsters).23 The series plans to further explore Jack's relationship with Ianto,24 and the temptation that Jack poses for the newly-engaged Gwen.25 The character will also appear in the 2008 series of Doctor Who.26
Literature
Jack features in the BBC Books New Series Adventures novels The Deviant Strain by Justin Richards,27 The Stealers of Dreams by Steve Lyons,28 and Only Human by Gareth Roberts.29 These novels take place between episodes of the 2005 series of Doctor Who. Captain Jack also appears in a number of Torchwood books, published by Ebury Press, which took over the BBC Books imprint in 2006. To date, Jack appears in Another Life by Peter Anghelides,30 Border Princes by Dan Abnett,31 and Slow Decay by Andy Lane.32 Published in March 2008, and tying in with the concurrently airing second series of Torchwood, Jack is set to appear in Trace Memory by David Llewellyn,33 The Twilight Streets by Gary Russell,34 and Something in the Water by Trevor Baxendale.35 Jack does not feature on the cover of the Doctor Who books in which he appears, but is featured alongside the Torchwood cast on the cover of each Torchwood book and is featured prominently on the covers of Another Life, Border Princes and Trace Memory.
As with all Doctor Who and Torchwood spin-off media, the canonicity in relation to the television series is unclear.36
Characterisation
Character creation
In naming the character, executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies drew inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness,37 a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived by with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero,38 and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character.39 Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, &quot;Is he a force for good or ill?&quot;40
The character's introduction served to posit him as a secondary hero and a rival to the series protagonist, the Doctor,41 simultaneously paralleling the Doctor's detached alien nature with Jack's humanity and &quot;heart&quot;.42 Such was the character's versatility, whereas in previous series the female &quot;companion&quot; would be exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences, the producers could reverse this dynamic, citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to &quot;look at good looking men&quot;. John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this.43
John Barrowman himself was a key factor in the conception of Captain Jack. Barrowman describes that at the time of his initial casting, Davies and co-executive producer, Julie Gardner had explained to him that they &quot;basically wrote the character around [John]&quot;.44 John recounts Davies as having been searching for an actor with a &quot;matin&lt;U+00E9&gt;e idol quality&quot;, telling him that &quot;the only one in the whole of Britain who could do it was you&quot;. A number of television critics have likened John's performance as Captain Jack to those of Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.45464748
Jack is bisexual,4950 and is also the first Doctor Who character to be openly anything other than heterosexual. In Jack's first appearance, the Doctor suggests that Jack's orientation is more common in the 51st century, when mankind will deal with multiple alien species and becomes more sexually flexible.51 Within Doctor Who's narrative, Jack's sexual orientation is not specifically labeled as that could &quot;make it an issue&quot;.5253 The bisexuality-related labels &quot;pansexual&quot; and &quot;omnisexual&quot; are also frequently applied to the character.54 Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack's mind.55 Within Torchwood, the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as &quot;quaint&quot;,56 implying a disbelief in total monosexuality.
Characteristics
The character is described as both &quot;lethally charming... good looking and utterly captivating&quot;,57 as well as &quot;flirtatious, cunning, clever and a bit of an action man&quot;.58 Within Doctor Who, Jack's personality is relatively light-hearted, although this changes in Torchwood's first series, where he becomes a darker character.59 In Torchwood Series 1, Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader, in which he is predominantly more aloof.60 In Torchwood, he would occasionally inquire or muse about the afterlife and religion,61 sympathising with a man's desire to die.62 Returning in Doctor Who Series 3, Jack indicates he now maintains a less suicidal outlook than before.6364 In the second series of Torchwood, Jack became a much more light-heatred character once again, after appearances in Doctor Who where he was reunited with the Doctor.65
When he observes fellow companion Martha Jones exhibiting feelings of unrequited love for the Doctor, he subtly admits he felt a degree of unrequited attraction for the Time Lord as well.66 Jack also appears to harbour romantic feelings for two of his employees, Gwen and Ianto, telling them both that they were the reason he returned to Cardiff, and asking Ianto on a date.67 In several instances in Torchwood, Jack displays no qualms about killing a person of any species,686970 which within Doctor Who, allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot.71 When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series, he is verbally warned &quot;don't you dare&quot; when pointing a gun,72 and scolded when contemplating snapping a tyrant's neck.73 By contrast, in other episodes, especially with regard to the dying,74 the aged,75 and the lonely,76 Jack displays kindness and sympathy, going so far as to lie to ease pain.77 This humanity and compassion for the dying may relate to his adamant existentialist philosophies.7879
Character development
The character's unexpected popularity with all audiences,808182 would later shape his appearances both as a traditional &quot;action hero&quot; and as a positive role model for younger viewers.83 Expanding upon his action hero role, the character would develop some supernatural abilities in Torchwood, primary among them a seemingly absolute immortality (with alternate mechanisms of resurrection and invulnerability),84 and also the ability to heal others8586 as well as limited telepathy.87 Russell T Davies referred to a scene in &quot;Last of the Time Lords&quot; as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character &quot;the Face of Boe&quot; (a large, mysterious disembodied head in a jar) as a consequence of his immortality and slow aging.88 The Face first appeared in 2005 episode &quot;The End of the World&quot;, appearing fully three times and maintaining a presence through to the end of the 2007 series.
Critical reception and impact
Following the character's initial introduction in the revived series 1 of Doctor Who, the character became incredibly popular with fans,899091 to the extent that Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner created a spin-off series, Torchwood, primarily centred around the character.92 The Times described the undeniable success of the character as having propelled actor John Barrowman to &quot;National Treasure status&quot;.93 Part of Jack's mystique was his sex appeal, swashbuckling heroism and sexual appetite.94 In anticipation of the character's return to Doctor Who in series 3 after a successful run in the first series of Torchwood, mainstream media hailed his return.95
In the media, Jack is described as both the &quot;first openly gay companion&quot; and as a &quot;hunky bisexual&quot;.96 Jack's notability is largely due to his mainstream representation of a bisexual man in science fiction television, for whom sexual identity is &quot;matter-of-fact&quot;,97 and not an issue.98 The ordinariness with which Jack's orientation is regarded within Doctor Who embodies part of a political statement about changing societal views of homosexuality.99 The distinct flexibility of Jack's sexuality contributed directly towards the character's popularity and public interest.100 The overtness of Jack's sexuality broke new grounds, the labels &quot;pansexual&quot; and &quot;omnisexual&quot; being applied to the character on occasion. In &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;, Jack kissed both Rose and the Doctor on the lips,101 the latter being the first same-sex kiss in the history of the programme. Despite the boldness of the first LGB character in the series' run, there has been very little uproar about the character, athough there was some controversy at the time of Jack's introduction.102
The presence of the character in prime time television sparked discussion of the nature of bisexuality in a number of outlets where normally it is dismissed or overlooked.103104105106 Channel4.com cites Jack as a positive role model for gay and bisexual teenagers,107108 where little had been present for this audience in years gone by and subsequently leading to a greater culture of tolerance. Readers of AfterElton.com, a gay mens' website, voted Jack the tenth best gay or bisexual television character of all time, the poll itself ultimately being won by Queer as Folk character Brian Kinney (also the product of Russell T Davies). The website praised Jack - one of only two bisexual characters on the list of 25 - for being having both &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;tender&quot; sides to his personality, as seen in the Torchwood episode &quot;Captain Jack Harkness&quot;.109 Amongst science fiction characters, Jack also topped another AfterElton rundown of top characters, beating Hellblazer's John Constantine for the top spot, commenting upon Jack's representation of a &quot;&lt;U+201C&gt;post-gay&lt;U+201D&gt; approach to sexual themes&quot; and awarding him a full 10/10 for cultural significance.110
Jack has gone on to become a recognisable figure in the British public consciousness, and therefore has attracted some parody. The character of Jack Harkness has been parodied several times on the satirical impressionist television show Dead Ringers. Played by Jon Culshaw, the show pokes fun at his bisexuality and apparent campiness, as well his melodramatic personality in Torchwood. In one sketch, he walks bizarrely towards the camera, kissing a policeman as he passes him.111 In another sketch, he can be seen having a threesome with two Cybermen,112 classic Doctor Who villains dating back to 1966.113 The character's popularity with young children has led to the creation of a Captain Jack action figure. The figurine depicts Jack as he appeared in his introductory episodes,114 specifically &quot;The Empty Child&quot;; however, more action figures are planned which will depict Jack in his Torchwood and Doctor Who Series 3 look.115
