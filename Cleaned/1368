Waking up the Neighbours is an album by Canadian singer/songwriter Bryan Adams released in 1991 (see 1991 in music) and his sixth studio album. The album was recorded at Battery Studios in England, and at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, mixed at Mayfair Studios in England, and mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk in New York City. &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; was number one on the British charts for a record-breaking sixteen weeks.1 After this success, the album was propelled to the #1 spot on the UK album chart, however only for one week.2 The album has sold 10 million copies worldwide becoming Adams' best-selling album with Reckless.3
The album was also notable in Canada for creating controversy concerning the system of Canadian content.4 Although Adams was one of Canada's biggest recording star at the time, his collaboration with the British&lt;U+2013&gt;White-Zimbabwean Lange meant that, under the rules in force until 1991, Waking up the Neighbours did not qualify as Canadian content.5
In September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced that the Canadian content rules would be changed to allow collaborations with non-Canadians.6
Music
Recording and production
The tune for &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; had been written by Kamen in the 60s.7 When he was finished he sent it to Adams and Lange who wrote the lyrics and instead of using traditional instrumentation for a medieval lyric gave it a rock treatment featuring Little Feat&lt;U+2019&gt;s Billy Payne on keyboards.8 On its release it topped the charts in 16 countries and sold over eight million copies worldwide becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time.9 The song was nominated for an Academy Award but it lost to the Disney theme &lt;U+201C&gt;Beauty and The Beast&lt;U+201D&gt;.10
Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, previously known for his work with AC/DC, Foreigner, and Def Leppard, was helping Adams' writing the songs for his next album. Adams' spent much of his time in England with Lange working on his sixth album.11
When the BBC asked Adams' &quot;Do you ever get bored of hearing your record-breaking hit Everything I Do?&quot; Adams said
&quot;Of course not. What a silly question. Everyone has heard the big production of the record many times, so that now I sing it very simply with my acoustic guitar, which is the way it was meant to be played when it was first written.&quot;12
In 1991, Adams was approached by the producers of the upcoming Kevin Costner film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and asked to work on a theme song. He was provided a melody written by the composer of the movie's score, Michael Kamen.13 With this, he and Lange fashioned &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,&quot; which he also recorded and which played under the closing credits of the film when it opened on June 14, 1991.14

Canadian content
The album made much controversy in Canada concerning the system of Canadian Content32 Although Adams was one of Canada's biggest recording star at the time, his collaboration with non Canadians ment that the album and songs were not Canadian.33
In February 1992 Adams had issues with his homeland&lt;U+2019&gt;s &lt;U+201C&gt;Canadian Content&lt;U+201D&gt; regulations, which restricted airplay of his album because Adams co-wrote and co-produced the record with an Englishman, Robert John &lt;U+201C&gt;Mutt&lt;U+201D&gt; Lange.34 Adams briefly threatened to boycott the annual Juno Awards, (Canada&lt;U+2019&gt;s equivalent of the Grammys), where he ended up winning Entertainer and Producer of the Year awards.35
Adams called the Canadian Content rule &quot;a disgrace, a shame...stupidity.&quot; and said:
&quot;You'd never hear Elton John being declared un-British,&quot; Adams continues. He's so angry that he says it's time to abolish the CRTC. Not everyone agrees.&quot;36
In September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission announced that the Canadian content rules would be changed to allow collaborations with non-Canadians.37
