Plot
Sheldon attempts to work out when he is going to die, and estimates that he has 60 years to live at most. He concludes that he will miss &quot;the singularity&quot;, a point in time in which technology will be advanced enough for him to transfer his brain into a machine and live forever. Based on this, he alters his diet, replacing pizza with cruciferous vegetables on Thursdays, beginning with brussel sprouts. He also makes the decision to start exercising and after Raj points out that Penny jogs, the two decide to go jogging together.
At nighttime, Sheldon knocks on Leonard's bedroom in distress, claiming to have cholera. When Leonard dismisses this, he suggests some equally unlikely alternatives, while Leonard thinks he may have appendicitis. Before they can go to the hospital, Sheldon farts loudly. Sheldon suggests that this was a result of the brussel sprouts he had and the two return to bed.
Sheldon meets up with Penny to go jogging and she attempts to get him to warm up. After he fails to touch his toes, she says they can warm up on the run. Sheldon jogs down the stairs and falls; when Penny tries to help him up, he farts again.
As a result of his failed attempts to have a healthier lifestyle, Sheldon creates a &quot;mobile virtual presence device&quot;: a robot which will replace him, performing his normal tasks while controlled by Sheldon from his bedroom. (The telepresence robot is a reference to Willow Garage.2) Leonard tries to convince him that the robot is crazy, but Sheldon refuses to listen to him as he believes it will increase his lifespan. Sheldon then cites Section 74C of the Roommate Agreement, which requires Leonard to assist him in the event that he becomes a robot.
Leonard is irritated by the robot when driving to work; although Sheldon attempts to relax him by playing music and suggesting games, when Leonard switches him off, he turns back on again shouting &quot;Bazinga!&quot; Leonard, taken by surprise, is furious that he &quot;almost died&quot;.
At the Cheesecake Factory, the gang spot Steve Wozniak and Sheldon converses with him through the robot. Sheldon says he has a 1977 Apple II, and Wozniak says that he would sign it if he had it there. Sheldon rushes to meet him but trips and falls down the stairs again, breaking the Apple II. Penny is forced to sing &quot;Soft Kitty&quot; to Sheldon's presence device.
