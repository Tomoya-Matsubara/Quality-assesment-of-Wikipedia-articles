&quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; was the debut single released by English band Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees. Issued in the UK by Polydor Records in 1978, the track was written by Banshees members Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin, John McKay and Kenny Morris and produced by their manager Nils Stevenson and a young sound-engineer Steve Lillywhite.
The song was named after the Hong Kong Garden Chinese takeaway in Chislehurst High Street. Siouxsie is quoted as explaining the lyrics with reference to the racist activities of skinheads visiting the takeaway:  .
The lyrics &quot;Slanted eyes meet a new sunrise / A race of bodies small in size / Chicken Chow Mein and Chop Suey / Hong Kong garden takeaway&quot; and the song itself could be interpreted as an ode to Chinese food restaurateurs whose culture is or was regarded with contempt by some non-Chinese in Britain.
The song was released as a stand-alone single and hit number seven in the UK singles chart. When the Banshees' debut album The Scream was released later in the year, &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; was not included. It later surfaced on the singles compilation album Once Upon a Time: The Singles. When The Scream was re-mastered and re-issued in 2005 with bonus material, &quot;Hong Kong Garden&quot; was included in the package.
In March 2005, Q magazine placed the song at number 90 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. It was also included on the soundtrack for Sofia Coppola's 2006 film Marie Antoinette. The version on the soundtrack features an orchestral string intro.
