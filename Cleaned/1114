Following John Kerry's appointment as Secretary of State, she was widely expected to run for the Senate seat once held by her husband in the 2013 special election. However she put all speculations to rest when she announced she wouldn't run and endorsed fellow Representative Ed Markey.
Family, education, and career
Tsongas was born Nicola Dickson Sauvage on April 26, 1946 in Chico, California. She was born to Marian Susan (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Wyman), an artist and copywriter, and Colonel Russell Elmer Sauvage, an engineer in the United States Army Air Forces who survived the attack on Pearl Harbor.1 Tsongas graduated in 1964 from Narimasu American High School in Japan, when her father was stationed at Fuchu Air Force Base. Tsongas went on to spend one year at Michigan State University, then transferred to Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she graduated from in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts in religion.23 After college she moved to New York City, where she took a job as a social worker for the Department of Welfare.4 Tsongas earned her Juris Doctor from Boston University and started Lowell's first all-female law practice.5
In 1967 while spending a summer in Arlington, Virginia interning for presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, she met Paul Tsongas, then an aide to Republican Congressman Brad Morse, at a party. In 1969, she married Paul and they had three daughters: Ashley, Katina, and Molly.67 A politician, Paul served in the House from  from 1975 to 1979, and the United States Senate from 1979 to 1985. After being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma Paul announced his retirement from and eventually resigned from Congress. After Paul's resignation she moved their family from Washington, D.C. back to Massachusetts to care for Paul as he was undergoing treatments.8 After seemingly being cured of his disease, in 1992 Paul ran for the Democratic Party nomination for President, coming in third behind former California Governor Jerry Brown and eventual winner Bill Clinton. Years later Paul's cancer returned and he died of pneumonia and liver failure on January 18, 1997.
Prior to being elected to the House, Tsongas worked as the Dean of External Affairs at Middlesex Community College,9 as a Board Member of Fallon Community Health Plan10 and served on the Lowell Civic Stadium and Arena Commission (which oversees several sites including the Tsongas Arena).11 In 2001, she was appointed by Representative Marty Meehan to head a foundation to provide education funding for the children of the victims of the September 11 attacks.12
U.S. House of Representatives
Elections
After Marty Meehan resigned in 2007 in order to serve as Chancellor of the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, Tsongas chose to run in the special election. Tsongas won the Democratic primary with 36% of the vote, defeating four other candidates.13 During her initial campaign Tsongas received endorsements from the Boston Globe, the Boston Herald, and the Lowell Sun.1415 During the general election, former President Bill Clinton, who defeated her husband for the Democratic nomination in 1992, campaigned for her. At an event in Lowell Clinton remarked: &quot;Congress will be a better place because she is there.&quot;16 Tsongas won the special election against Republican Jim Ogonowski with 51% of the vote on October 17,17 becoming the only female Representative from Massachusetts, and fourth in state history.18
After running unopposed in 2008, in 2010 Tsongas faced Republican Jon Golnik, a small businessman and former Wall Street currency trader. During the campaign Tsongas attacked Golnik's history as a Vice President of AIG,19 while Golnik called her attacks hypocritical, as she had stock in AIG and other large corporations.20 Tsongas defeated Golnik with 52% of the vote.21 Following redistricting after the 2010 census, Tsongas ran for re-election in the reconfigured  in 2012. In a rematch, she again faced and defeated Golnick.22
Tenure
A major issue in her initial election was whether the two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. While Tsongas said she would vote to override, it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto.23 Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but it failed to achieve the two-thirds necessary.24
As a candidate in 2007, Tsongas promised withdrawing troops and ending the Iraq War:25 which her first bill introduced aimed to do by implementing a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, however it died in committee.26 In 2010, Tsongas along with other women in Congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, visited Afghanistan to oversee the war effort. Upon returning, Tsongas spoke of the need for the involvement of women in the rebuilding of the government.27
Tsongas is an advocate for universal health care and supports a public health insurance option.2829 In 2010 Tsongas voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.30 In 2012 Tsongas joined a Republican-led effort to repeal a 2.3% sales tax on medical-device manufacturers, which passed the House 270-146 with 36 other Democrats voting for it.31 Tsongas is pro-choice and received a 100% approval rating from Planned Parenthood in 2008.32 A supporter of LGBT rights, Tsongas cosponsored the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act;33 and voted for the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which allows homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces.
Following Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal, Tsongas was the only Representative from Massachusetts to call for his resignation, saying &quot;it would be appropriate for [him] to step down.&quot;34 In the 2012 Massachusetts Senate election, Tsongas was the first major Democratic politician to endorse the eventual winner, Elizabeth Warren, whom she called &quot;a fighter for middle class families.&quot;35 Following President Barack Obama's designation of John Kerry as United States Secretary of State, there was much speculation that she would run for his seat, previously held by her husband.36 Though Tsongas briefly considered a run, she responded she would best be able to serve the people of Massachusetts by continuing to serve in the House, and instead endorsed fellow Representative, Ed Markey.3738
