Alive is a live album released by Snot in 2002. The songs were all performed and recorded at The Palace in Hollywood, California in May, 1998. Alive also features the last Snot track ever recorded with Lynn Strait on vocals, &quot;Choose What?&quot;. This track, minus Strait's vocals, plus Serj Tankian's vocals and lyrics, appeared on the Strait Up tribute album as &quot;Starlit Eyes&quot;. This album is most likely Snot's last, due to their wishes not to continue following Strait's death.
