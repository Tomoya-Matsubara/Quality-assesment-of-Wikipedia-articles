Crist signs differential tuition bill (By Aaron DeSlatte and Angeline Taylor - Florida Capital Bureau) Retrieved on 6-30-2007 Florida State is also one of two flagship universities in the State University System of Florida.6 7 8 While FSU was officially established in 1851 and is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida, predecessor institutions may be traced back to 1843, two years before Florida was admitted as a state in the United States.910
Florida State University is also home to nationally ranked programs in many academic areas, including the sciences, social policy, film, engineering, the Arts, business, politics and law.11 Florida State is also home to Florida's only National Laboratory - the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory as well as being the birthplace of the commercially-viable anti-cancer drug Taxol. The renowned Florida State University athletics programs are favorites of passionate students, fans and alumni across the United States, especially when led by the Marching Chiefs of the FSU College of Music. Florida State is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference and has won eleven national athletic championships to date.
__TOC__
History of the university
 Florida State University is one of the two oldest of the eleven institutions of higher learning in the State University System of Florida. Florida State University traces its origins to 1823 when the Territorial Legislature of Florida began planning a system of higher education.12 Two townships were set aside by the United States Congress for seminaries of higher learning, one on each side of the Suwannee River. By 1838, the first constitution of the State of Florida embraced and permanently guaranteed to provide for this system of general education (schools) and higher education (seminaries).13 On January 24, 1851 the State of Florida Legislature established the two seminaries.14 A bitter competition then ensued between the cities of Marianna, FL, Quincy, FL and Tallahassee for the West Florida Seminary. By 1854, as an inducement to the Legislature, the leaders of Tallahassee built and operated an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee.15 Francis W. Eppes, the grandson of Thomas Jefferson and who grew up on Monticello, with the help of other city leaders, eventually won the competition for the location, which awarded Tallahassee the west seminary by the Florida Legislature in 1856.  The rise of land slightly west of the center of Tallahassee, formerly known as Gallows Hill, (and which was the site and building of the ongoing Florida Institute) was offered and accepted as the site of the state seminary for male students. While the seminary did not officially hold classes until 1857, it absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy16, begun in 1843 as the Misses Bates School, thereby becoming co-educational.17 As a result of this merger Florida State University is the oldest university in Florida, with clear predecessor operations traceable to 1843, about two years before Florida became a state of the United States. The West Florida Seminary stood near the front of the Westcott Building on the existing FSU campus.18 This site is the oldest continually used location of higher learning in Florida.1920The eastern seminary was located in Ocala, FL in 1853 and was closed during the American Civil War. It reopened in 1866 in Gainesville, FL (and would eventually be combined with other schools to form what would be called the University of Florida in 1906).21
During the Civil War the name of the seminary was changed to The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute and began military training for students. Young cadets from the school, along with other soldiers from Tallahassee, defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865 .2223 As a result, Tallahassee was the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces. The Army ROTC unit at Florida State University is one of only three ROTC units in the United States with permission to display a campaign streamer. The Florida State University ROTC streamer reads NATURAL BRIDGE 1865. After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union forces for over a month. The West Florida Seminary reverted to a purely academic purpose after the war, and began a period of substantial growth and development. In 1884, the school awarded its first diplomas, called Licentiates of Instruction. In 1885 the Florida Legislature renamed the seminary the University of Florida in a law which was part of an effort by the Board of Education to reorganize Florida's system of higher education. The school never embraced the title, apparently due to lack of funding from the Florida Legislature, but when other schools eventually tried to adopt the name &quot;University of Florida&quot; about 20 years later, officials from the Florida State College reminded the newcomers of the law and the original holder of the title in a 1903 university publication.24 By 1891 the seminary began to focus on what would be recognized today as post-secondary education and as of 1897 was clearly the first liberal arts college in Florida.25
 In 1901 the seminary was renamed the Florida State College and was organized into four departments (the College, the College Academy, the School for Teachers and the School of Music). Florida State College was a four-year institution with authority to award the Master of Arts graduate degree. The first master's degree was issued by the college in 1902.
The 1905 Buckman Act reorganized the existing seven Florida colleges into three institutions, segregated by race and gender - a school for Caucasian males, a school for Caucasian females and a school for African Americans. As a result of this reorganization, the coeducational Florida State College was renamed the Florida Female College, (which by 1909 was changed to the Florida State College for Women (FSCW) after the initial women's title was generally rejected) and accepted only white female students.26 All male students were subsequently required to attend the school for males, taking with them the fraternity system and the football team. The Buckman bill was the brainchild of H.H. Buckman, a legislator from Duval County, Florida. The Buckman bill was hotly debated, one legislator said in debate: &quot;I believe in coeducation. Statistics prove satisfactory to me that separate institutions for male and female is detrimental (sic) to both--physically, mentally and morally.&quot;27 Further, per Shira Birnbaum, Ph.D in her article Making Southern belles in progressive era Florida: Gender in the formal and hidden curriculum of the Florida Female College (Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, 1996) the Buckman Act:
didn't merely standardize, consolidate and narrow opportunities for public higher education in Florida. It also inaugurated an era of new school gender practices. Right from the start, in fact, the Buckman Act's message to Florida's women was that the highest levels of educational attainment--the advanced degrees and professional schools of a &quot;university education--would be reserved for white males attending the new all-male University of the State of Florida. White women, by contrast, had to settle for a &quot;college.&quot; Furthermore, the Buckman Act mandated that the university would &quot;teach...the fundamental laws and...the rights and duties of citizens ...&quot; to its male students. The college, by contrast, would &quot;teach...all the useful arts and sciences that may be necessary or appropriate.&quot; A dual discourse had been laid out--one that framed education for white men as a matter of &quot;citizenship&quot; and education for white women as a matter of &quot;usefulness&quot;.28
A residence hall currently on the campus of the University of Florida bears the name Buckman Hall in honor of the legislator. Curiously, no equivalent building exists on the campus of Florida State University.29
Despite the impact of the Buckman Act, Albert A. Murphree, then President of the Florida State College, determined to stress liberal studies and academic excellence.30 By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women&lt;U+2019&gt;s college in the United States.31 In 1935, the College was awarded the Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in Florida.3233 The Florida State College for Women was the first state women's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, as well as the first university in Florida to be so honored for academic quality.34  After World War II, returning soldiers taking advantage of the new GI Bill of Rights placed an unexpectedly heavy demand on the state university system. The Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida (TBUF) was quickly opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women.3536 The men were housed in former barracks on Dale Mabry Field, an existing WWII U.S. Army Air Force training field west of Tallahassee, that was deactivated in part after the war. Male students were then enrolled into the Florida State College for Women and traveled to the main campus by bus. Part of Dale Mabry Field became known as &quot;West Campus&quot; during this brief period. By the end of the 1946-1947 school year, 954 men were enrolled in the TBUF program. By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the FSCW to coeducational status and renamed the Florida State College for Women Florida State University.37 The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College.  The 1950s brought substantial growth and development to the university. Several colleges were added and the first Ph.D. was awarded in Chemistry by 1952 . Many buildings recognizable today were added to the university such as the Strozier Library, Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building. Programs supplementing the original liberal arts and education departments were added including Business, Journalism (discontinued in 1959), Library Science, Nursing and Social Welfare. Social Welfare was later split into the College of Criminology and the College of Social Work.
During the 1960s and 1970s Florida State University was known as a center of student activism especially in the areas of racial integration, women's rights and the Vietnam War. The school acquired the nickname 'Berkeley of the South'38 during this period, in reference to similar student activities at the University of California, Berkeley and is also purported to be the site of the genesis of &quot;streaking,&quot; which is said to have first been observed on Landis Green.3940 Governor Claude Kirk once spent a night on Landis Green, in the center of campus, discussing politics with protesting students. Elements of free speech activism still exist at FSU today. The Center for Participant Education was established in 1970 as an alternative to traditional university academics. Its purpose is to allow students to &quot;explore socially relevant topics and to foster a healthier philosophy of education through classes in which anyone could teach or attend. Since then, CPE has been investigated by the Legislature, suspended by the Board of Regents, and challenged by FSU administration. CPE has managed to hold strong through all of this, and remains today as one of the last free universities in the country.&quot;41 Florida State also established the Institute of Molecular Biophysics, Space Biosciences and the Programs in Medical Studies. In 1962 the first African American student enrolled at the university and the first African American Ph.D. students graduated in 1970.
Today, Florida State University aspires to become a top American research university with at least one-third of its graduate programs ranked in the Top-15 nationally. Florida State University owns more than 1,530 acres (6.2km&lt;U+00B2&gt;)42 and is the home of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory among other advanced research facilities. The university continues to develop in its capacity as a leader in Florida graduate research. Other milestones at the university include the first ETA10-G/8 supercomputer43, capable of 10.8 GFLOPS in 1989, remarkable for the time in that it exceeded the existing speed record of the Cray-2/8, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory by a substantial leap and the development of the anti-cancer drug Taxol.
The Jefferson-Eppes Trophy is exchanged between the University of Virginia and Florida State University after each football competition in recognition of the common roots shared between the two schools.
Pathways of Excellence
 The strategic vision of Florida State University, known as Pathways of Excellence, changed in September 2005 as the result of an evaluation of &quot;FSU&lt;U+2019&gt;s academic productivity and recognition as viewed in the context of the Phase I and Phase II indicators for membership in the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the standards used by the National Research Council for evaluating doctoral programs.&quot;44 The task group made recommendations, on which FSU President Wetherell acted, which are intended to have a dramatic transformational effect on the overall academic quality and scholarly productivity of the university. The faculty group created specific goals for the university which include substantial investment in new university faculty hired in &quot;academic clusters&quot;45 focused principally on doctoral-level research. Coupled with this investment in 200 new faculty members is an aggressive expansion of the physical infrastructure of the university.46 To date, new construction is underway or recently completed for a new Experimental Social Science Laboratory, a College of Medicine Research Building, a new Psychology Building, a new Chemistry Building, a new Life Sciences Teaching and Research Building and a new Materials Research Building.
Concurrently, other existing research facilities at the university have been renovated, including the Nancy Smith Fichter Dance Theatre, the Kasha Laboratory of the Institute of Molecular Biophysics plus enhancements to the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and a new Applied Superconductivity Center.
Enrollment and admissions

The SAT scores reported include scores of students admitted through alternative programs.48 The top 25% of fall freshmen students at Florida State University enrolled with an average GPA of 4.23, average SAT score of 1332 and average ACT score of 30.49
The freshman acceptance rate for the 2006 Fall semester was 53.7%. Preliminary reports for the Fall 2007 semester indicate an acceptance rate drop to 46% due to an increase in undergraduate applicants along with an increasing freshmen retention rate. 50 Recently, the administration at Florida State has publicly discussed reducing freshman enrollment due to reductions in state appropriations.51 59 Florida State University - FSU News: &quot;FSU freezes enrollment, tightens budgets&quot; Retrieved on 6-30-2007.
The most popular Colleges by enrollment are Arts and Sciences, Business, Social Sciences, Education, and Human Science.
A number of undergraduate academic programs at Florida State University are termed &quot;Limited Access Programs&quot;. Limited Access Programs are programs where student demand exceeds available resources thus making admission to such programs sometimes extremely competitive. Examples of limited access programs include The Florida State University Film School, the College of Communication, several majors in the College of Visual Arts, Theatre and Dance and all majors in the College of Business.52
Undergraduate Honors Program
 The FSU Honors Program is a specially designed program for the most accomplished incoming undergraduates. Undergraduates in Honors participate in smaller classes with faculty, including individual research programs or assigned research in the area of the sponsoring faculty member. Admission to Honors is competitive. The FSU Honors Medical and Law early-admission, professional-track programs are designed to facilitate faster access to professional programs for the limited number of students who meet required standards. Honors students are eligible for the Honors residence hall and associated administrative benefits.
Young Scholars Program
FSU Young Scholars Program (YSP) is a residential science and mathematics program for 40 Florida high-school students with potential for careers in the sciences53, engineering, and health professions.54 In 2005, the mean PSAT math score was in the 98th percentile nationally. Eleven of the 40 students were ranked first in their class, and the rest were all in the top 10% of their class. The average GPA of attendees in 2005 was 4.84.

Taxol - anti-cancer drug
A significant achievement at the university was chemistry professor and synthetic organic chemist, Robert A. Holton's synthesizing of Taxol on Dec. 9, 1993. The chemical has been used as an effective breast cancer and ovarian cancer treatment.
Dr. Holton and his organic chemistry team won a race to develop a cheaper semisynthetic version (Holton Taxol total synthesis). In 1993, Bristol-Myers Squibb began marketing Taxol&lt;U+00AE&gt;, ultimately earning more than $1.6 billion by the year 2000. Just like other chemotherapy drugs, it had side effects, but it also prolonged lives, and in many cases caused a full remission of cancer.67
Before the drug company's exclusive license expired, Florida State earned $351 million in royalties, vaulting the school into the ranks of Columbia University and California's state universities in research profits. By comparison, Taxol has earned Florida State more than three times what the popular beverage Gatorade earned the University of Florida.68
Computer Science
FSU's Computer Science program is a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) by the National Security Agency. Florida State is the only university in Florida to achieve this status. Recently, computer security specialists from Florida State examined the computer code firmware contained within the Election Systems &amp; Software iVotronic Voting Machines used in the disputed 2006 congressional election of Florida's District 13 between Vern Buchanan and Christine Jennings.6970

The residence halls range from renovated buildings built during the early 1900s to brand-new facilities. On-campus housing is generally preferred by many students as automobile parking on or near campus can become a competitive effort. Students typically dine in university-contracted campus dining facilities (provided by Aramark), as well as commercial restaurants that are located on and near campus. Many students also prepare their own meals in residence hall kitchens. Some residence halls require students to participate in a campus meal plan.

Seminoles - an unconquered people
The school's athletic teams are called the Seminoles. This Native American name is used with official sanction of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, Inc. and the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma. They participate in the NCAA's Division I (Division I-A for football) and in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Their traditional rivals include the University of Florida Gators and the University of Miami Hurricanes.
Under head coach Bobby Bowden, currently in his 31st year, the Seminole football team became one of the nation's perennial powers, greatly expanding the tradition of football at Florida State.116 The Seminoles played in five national championship games between 1993 and 2001, and have claimed the championship twice, in 1993 and 1999 . The FSU football team was the most successful team in college football during the 1990s, boasting an 89% winning percentage. FSU also set an NCAA record for most consecutive Top 5 finishes in the AP football poll - receiving placement 14 years in a row, from 1987 to 2000. The Seminoles were the first college football team in history to go wire-to-wire (ranked first place from preseason to postseason) since the AP began releasing preseason rankings in 1936. FSU also owns the record for most consecutive Bowl game victories with 11 between 1985 and 1996.117
FSU head coach Bobby Bowden is the Division I college football coach leader in the NCAA with 366 career wins, followed by Penn State's Joe Paterno with 363. FSU football is well-known for introducing talented players into the NFL, including Deion Sanders, Terrell Buckley, Derrick Brooks, Sebastian Janikowski, Walter Jones, Corey Simon, Anquan Boldin, Javon Walker, Warrick Dunn, Peter Boulware, Laverneus Coles, Brad Johnson, Samari Rolle, and many other players in recent history.
In 2006, the FSU men's Track &amp; Field team won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship, the NCAA East Regional championship and the NCAA National Championship. Head Coach Bob Braman and Associate Head Coach Harlis Meaders helped lead individual champions in the 200 m (Walter Dix), the triple jump (Raqeef Curry), and the shot put (Garrett Johnson). Individual runners-up were Walter Dix in the 100 m, Ricardo Chambers in the 400 m, and Tom Lancashire in the 1500 m. Others scoring points in the National Championship were Michael Ray Garvin in the 200 m (8th),Andrew Lemoncello in the 3000 m steeplechase (4th), Raqeef Curry in the long jump (6th), and Garrett Johnson in the discus (5th).118 In 2007, FSU won its second straight men's Track &amp; Field NCAA National Championship when Dix became the first person to hold the individual title in the 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m at the same time.119
Traditions
The school's colors are Garnet and Gold. The colors of Garnet and Gold represent a merging of the University's past. While the school fielded a football team as early, or earlier than 1899120, in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple and gold uniforms.121122 When FSC became Florida State College for Women in 1905, the football team and fraternity system was forced to attend the now all male school in Gainesville, thus marking the beginning of the football program at the University of Florida.123 The following year, the college student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. When football returned to the school about 42 years later the now famous Garnet and Gold colors were first used on an FSU uniform in a 14-6 loss to Stetson University on October 18, 1947. 
FSU is also the home of the esteemed Marching Chiefs, the largest collegiate marching band in the world. The Marching Chiefs are the force behind the famous &quot;War Chant&quot;124. The War Chant is believed to be a version of another song chanted first during the 1960s.125 
School songs
Alma Mater - High Over Towering Pines: High over towering pines our voices swell, Praising those Gothic spires, we love so well. Here sons and daughters stand, faithful and true, Hailing our alma mater, F.S.U.
Hymn to the Garnet and Gold: Here's a hymn to the Garnet and the Gold, ringing to the sky. Here's a song for the men and women bold. Sing with heads held high. Striving ere to seek to know, Fight for victory. Alma Mater, this our song to you. Echoes, F.S.U.
FSU Fight Song You've got to fight, fight, fight, for FSU, You've got to scalp 'em Seminoles, You've got to win, win, win, win this game, And roll on down to make those goals, For FSU is on the warpath now, and at the battle's end she's great. So fight, fight, fight, fight for victory, the Seminoles of Florida State! F-L-O-R-I-D-A S-T-A-T-E! Florida State, Florida State, Florida State, Woooo!
The fight song was written by Florida State music professor, Thomas Wright, who owns the rights to the song.126 Wright allows FSU to use the Fight Song every year in exchange for two season tickets.127 According to Wright, the Native American profile often used as a symbol of FSU was also based on the profile of his face.
The 1950 Florida State University Homecoming half-time show included a dedication ceremony naming the stadium in honor of university President Doak Campbell. There was also a special performance by the band, christening it the Marching Chiefs and premiering the Florida State University Fight Song.
Fifty years later, the FSU Fight Song is one of the most widely recognized college tunes in the country. Mission Control awakened alumnus and current professor Norm Thagard, with the Fight Song one morning in 1983 while he was aboard the Challenger spacecraft.

16 Text of speech given by Robert M.

Many came into being after the Morrill Act of 1863 provided the federal grants of land to the states to establish public universities. Some states built two institutions, a land-grant college focused on agriculture and the &quot;mechanical arts&quot; as well as general education, and another more directed at classical education and the other professions...These institutions formed the core of the public systems of higher education in their respective states.&quot; Retrieved on 4-28-2007.↩

Owing to lack of means for the support of this more ambitious project, and also owing to the fact that soon thereafter schools for technical training were established, this association soon dissolved. It remains to be remarked, however, that the legislative act passed in 1885, bestowing upon the institution the title of the University of Florida, has never been repealed. The more pretentious name is not assumed by the college owing to the fact that it does not wish to misrepresent its resources and purposes.&quot; Retrieved on 4-29-2007.↩
