Doctor William &quot;Will&quot; Zimmerman is a main character and male lead of the Canadian fantasy-science fiction television series Sanctuary. He is portrayed by Robin Dunne. Will is introduced in the series as a forensic psychiatrist who was recruited by Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping), head of the Sanctuary Network, to become her recent prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;.
Dunne was apporached to appear on the series by director Martin Wood, whom he worked with before, but was initially reluctant to appear in the original web series. Dunne's portrayal of Will vastly differed in the first season, while the second would introduce more darkness to the character.
Some television critics compared the character to Stargate SG-1 character Daniel Jackson. Dunne's portrayal of Will earned him a Leo Award for &quot;Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series&quot; in 2010. He was nominated a further two Leo Awards in the same categories and a Constellation Award, in which he narrowly lost to Doctor Who actor David Tennant.
Character arc
Background
Will Zimmerman's maternal relatives are said to have come from Dublin, Ireland.1 One of his known ancestors was Jack Zimmerman (Dunne), who served in the United States Army and was killed in action in Normandy during D-Day in 1944.2 When Will was a child, he was terrorized by a violent creature who killed his mother. However, Will was saved by Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping), who captured it.3 In the web series, he was a victim of Bigfoot (Christopher Heyerdahl) before he worked as a butler in the Sanctuary; Bigfoot liked to scare little children.4 In his adult life, he worked with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), until he was fired for his outlandish theories. He since worked with the Old City Police Department as a forensic psychiatrist, though his co-workers do not take him seriously there either. Before the series began he had a girlfriend, Meg (Kandyse McClure), who broke up with him.5
Season one
The first season begins with Will investigating the deaths of two police officers; though the police believe they found the killer, Will believes there was a child in the apartment, but his theory was rebuked. He is later recruited by Helen Magnus to join her Sanctuary team, an organization who track down several abnormals around the world and give them refuge at one of their bases, and become her new prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;. She too believes there was a child, Alexei (Cainan Weibe),6 who killed his victims with an appendage when he feels scared. At the end of the pilot, Will eventually accepts his new position, having been promised &quot;the adventure of many, many lifetimes.&quot;7 In &quot;Warriors&quot;, his old friend Danny went missing, and he searches for him. He finds him but is captured and injected with the same drug as Danny to turn him into an Abnormal in a Fight Club-like organisation run by the Cabal, an underground organization who seek to control all abnormals, though he is eventually rescued and reverts to Human again.8 In the first season finale, Will has a new love interest; Clara Griffin (Christine Chatelain), granddaughter of the late Nigel Griffin, Magnus' colleague; Clara shares his invisibility skills.9
Season two
In the season two premiere &quot;End of Nights&quot;, Clara is killed by Cabal superabnormals before their defeat, which greatly affected Will.10 In an alternate future in the season two episode &quot;Pavor Nocturnus&quot;, which takes place ten years into the episode's future where the world is overrun by zombie-like creatures after Magnus unknowingly unleashed a virus will curing her longevity, Will is depicted as the only living survivor of the Sanctuary Network. He did at some point, have a relationship with colleague Kate Freelander (Agam Darshi), and had a son, Magnus Zimmerman following the death of the alternate Magnus. He starts his own survivalist group and sacrifices himself in aiding the present Magnus to correct her mistake.11 While on assignment in Mumbai, in &quot;Kali&quot;, Will becomes host to a Macri, a creature with a connection to Big Bertha, the most powerful abnormal on Earth. He has the Macri forcibly removed from Edward Forsythe, which leaves him fatally ill.12 Despite this, Will still maintains a telepathic connection to Bertha, who appears to him as the goddess Kali, and he manages to reach out to her and get her to stop her attacks after Magnus severs Forsythe's connection to her. However, Terrance Wexford (Paul McGillion) takes command of the Sanctuary Network, and attacks Bertha, causing her to turn on Will and create three tsunamis.13
Season three
In one final effort to convince her to stop, Will is to die so he can encounter Kali, along with two other beings, in an afterlife to convince them to stop the tsunamis. Kali uses her powers to stop one of the waves, but Wexford badly injures Bertha before she can finish. Will, figuring that the other two beings must be powerful, begs them to save her and his world, which they oblige, after which they resurrect him.14 Though he at first does not recall the meeting, but later two abnormals are able to access his mind, and he determines that Magnus' father, Gregory (Jim Byrnes), left him clues15 leading to Hollow Earth, an underground area below the surface that is though to be the origin of the abnormal population.16 In the mid-season finale &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;, he and the team enter Hollow Earth, but are captured by its security force, who execute the team for trespassing.17 In the next episode, he and the team are resurrected in exchange for helping the underground city Praxis from destruction from its own geothermal energy.18
Throughout the second half of the third season, Wil enters a romantic relationship with FBI agent Abby Corrigan.1920 In &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, it is revealed that on his travels to Hollow Earth, he became infected from a reptillian creature called a Cillobar, and is slowly transforming into one. He gradually loses his inhibitions, and escapes the Sanctuary until he is captured again when Magnus finds a cure to his condition, where he would transform back to human.21 In the season finale &quot;Into the Black&quot;, Will overlooks the exodus of several abnormals from Hollow Earth, where it is revealed Praxis is destroyed, having been caused by Magnus' nemesis Adam Worth (Ian Tracey), who attempts to travel back in time to save his dead daughter. Later, Will discovers that Worth made agreements with several abnormal tribe leaders to invade the planet surface.22
Characterization
Will Zimmerman is described by Syfy as &quot;a brilliant forensic psychiatrist&quot; and a &quot;master of behavioral science&quot; who &quot;can translate the most veiled human signals into case-breaking deductions.&quot;23 However, his fascination with otherworldy explanations for horrific crimes cost him the respect of his peers and position. His qualities have attracted the attention of Magnus, who offers him a position in the Sanctuary.24 He would become her newest prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt; throughout the series. Magnus has stated to Will in one episode that he was her first prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt; in decades to show promise.25 In describing Will and Magnus' working relationship, Dunne stated; &quot;there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of.&quot;26
In a Blastr interview, Dunne explained Will's journey throughout the first season, and what has become of him for the second; &quot;[In the first season] he spent time getting used to the sanctuary and having his foot in both worlds, but not sure which way he was going to go. By the end of season one, he jumped right into the sanctuary and resigned himself to that life. Now there's a lot going on for Will. Already he's had to deal with some pretty major things. These things that happen in the first few episodes [on the second season] dredge up some old memories of his past. There's definitely more of a darkness to Will, and he's kind of wrestling with some demons.&quot;27
Conceptual history
 Damian Kindler conceived the series in 2001, and several of his original ideas ended in the finale product, one of them was Magnus &quot;co-op[ing] a young psychiatrist to help her track down monsters and help people.&quot;28 Dunne was approached by director Martin Wood, who he worked with a few years before. He was given the script and enjoyed &quot;everything&quot; about it, including his character. However, Dunn had some initial reluctance to appear on the show as it would start as a web series, and web series were not given enough media coverage at the time he was approached. However, he agreed to appear and went to Vancouver to film it.29 After the series was adapted for television, the producers found that Dunne's portrayal of Will differed vastly.30 The episode &quot;Requiem&quot; featured a scenario where Will has to make a difficult decision to kill Magnus when she becomes a threat, even thought Will already came to be an established prot&lt;U+00E9&gt;g&lt;U+00E9&gt;.31 By the first season finale, the producers wanted to introduce a potential love interest for Will. Dunne contributed in the casting of the love interest, Clara Griffin; he recommended the producers cast Christine Chatelain, as both actors worked together before.32
In the first few episodes in the second season, Dunne has said that playing Will was challenging, yet exciting for the character's journey.33 With regards to season three, Kindler said that Will would be instrumental in changing the audience's perspective on the series, since in the season's second episode &quot;Firewall&quot;, the unsolved mysteries that were locked in Will's mind would be unlocked and become the focal points of what the team would be doing. Kindler also decided to allow Will another love interest that would not be killed unlike Clara Griffin.34
Reception
Some reviewers commented that Zimmerman is somewhat of Sanctuary's equivalent of Daniel Jackson from Stargate SG-1.3536 Mark Wilson of About.com stated that Zimmerman is the one character who &quot;really pulls the viewer into Sanctuary's world. Instantly likable, able to seem intellectually gifted without being off-putting [...] Dunne's performance as Will is one of the more effortless realizations of the viewer-identification character in recent sci-fi/fantasy that I've seen.&quot;37
Over the course of the series, Dunne's portrayal of Will have resulted in four award nominations, one of which was won. In 2009, he was nominated for a Gemini Award for &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role,&quot; for his role in &quot;Requiem&quot;, but lost out to Flashpoint actor Enrico Colantoni.38 In 2010, Dunne won a Leo Award for &quot;Best Lead Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series&quot; for the season two episode &quot;Pavor Nocturnus&quot;.39 In the same year, he was nominated for a Constellaton Award for &quot;Best Male Performance in a 2009 Science Fiction Television Episode&quot;, but lost out to Doctor Who actor David Tennant, for his role in the episode &quot;The Waters of Mars&quot;, by only one percent of the votes.4041 In 2011, Dunne was again nominated for a Leo Award for the episode &quot;Vigilante&quot;,42 but lost out to Shattered actor Callum Keith Rennie.43
