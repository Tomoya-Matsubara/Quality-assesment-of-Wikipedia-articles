&quot;Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; is a TIME magazine article highly critical of Scientology, which was written by investigative journalist Richard Behar and first published on May 6, 1991 as an eight-page cover story.12 The article was also later published in the Reader's Digest, in October 1991.3 Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in Forbes magazine. He stated that he was investigated by Church of Scientology attorneys and private investigators while researching the TIME article, and investigators contacted his friends and family as well. The article itself dealt with L. Ron Hubbard and the development of Scientology, its various controversies over the years and history of litigation, conflict with psychiatry and the IRS, the suicide of a Scientologist, its status as a religion, and its business dealings.
After the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to inform the public of what it felt were falsehoods in the piece. It took out advertisements in USA Today for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on Nightline about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige also alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology also brought a libel suit against Time Warner and writer Richard Behar, and sued Reader's Digest in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States in the case was denied in 2001.
Richard Behar received multiple awards in honor of his work on the article, including the 1992 Gerald Loeb Award. In commentary on the piece, the book Let Them Eat Prozac was critical, stating that the article was over the top, and the book Unsecular Media characterized one of the segments of the article an &quot;atrocity tale.&quot; The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through. The article has been cited by Anderson Cooper on CNN, in a story on Panorama's 2007 program &quot;Scientology and Me&quot; on the BBC, and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the cult and new religious movement perspectives.
Research for the article
Richard Behar had previously published a report on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard's financial success, in a 1986 article in Forbes magazine, entitled: &quot;The Prophet and Profits of Scientology.&quot;4 Behar wrote that during research for &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power,&quot; he and a TIME contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology.5678 Behar stated that investigators contacted his friends and previous work associates and asked them if he had a history of tax or drug problems, and also obtained a copy of his personal credit report which had been illegally accessed from a national credit bureau.91011
Behar believed that the motive of these operatives was to &quot;threaten, harass and discredit him.&quot;1213 He later came to learn that the Church of Scientology's head private investigator was orchestrating his investigation.14 Anderson Cooper 360 also reported that Behar had been contacted by Church of Scientology attorneys numerous times while doing research on the article.15 The parents of Noah Lottick, a Scientologist who had committed suicide, cooperated with TIME and Readers Digest in pre-publication development.16
Contents
&quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; reported on the founding of the Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard and controversies involving the Church, as well as the suicide of a Scientologist, and Church of Scientology affiliated business operations.1718 The article related the May 11, 1990, suicide of Dr. Edward Lottick's son Noah Antrim Lottick.19 Noah Lottick was a Russian studies student who had taken a series of Scientology courses, and he died after jumping from a hotel tenth floor window.20 Initially, his father had thought that Scientology was similar to Dale Carnegie's techniques. However, after his ordeal, Dr. Lottick now believes that the organization is a &quot;school for psychopaths.&quot;21
The article outlined a brief history of Scientology, discussing L. Ron Hubbard's initial background as a science fiction writer, and cited a California judge who had deemed Hubbard to be a &quot;pathological liar.&quot;22 The Church of Scientology's litigation history was also described, in addition to its conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service, with various countries regarding whether or not to accept it as a religion, and its position against psychiatry.23 Behar also wrote of the expensive costs involved in participation in the Church of Scientology, and what he referred to as &quot;front groups and financial scams,&quot; and harassment of critics.24 He estimated that the Church of Scientology paid USD$20 million annually to over one hundred attorneys.25 Behar wrote that though the Church of Scientology portrays itself as a religion, he maintained that it was actually a &quot;hugely profitable global racket&quot; which intimidated members and critics in a Mafia-like manner.262728
Cynthia Kisser, who was at the time director of the Cult Awareness Network, was quoted in the article, stating: &quot;Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. No cult extracts more money from its members.&quot;2930 This quote has since been referenced verbatim in other secondary sources discussing Scientology.3132
Church of Scientology's response
Public statements
The Church of Scientology responded to the publication of &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; by taking out four-color, full-page ads in USA Today in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, protesting the Time magazine cover article.33 Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled: &quot;Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991 Issues of TIME Magazine,&quot; and: &quot;The Story That TIME Couldn't Tell.&quot;34
On February 14, 1992, Church leader David Miscavige gave what he told Ted Koppel was his first ever interview on Scientology, on the ABC News program, Nightline.35 The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics, and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar appeared on the program, and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the &quot;ulterior motive&quot; is really to get people to take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later on in the program, Ted Koppel questioned David Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the TIME magazine article, noting that the Church had spent USD$3 million in large advertisements in USA Today. Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the TIME article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the TIME article, and Miscavige called Richard Behar: &quot;a hater.&quot; Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the TIME piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to &quot;kidnap Scientologists out.&quot; Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was &quot;missing the issue,&quot; and said that his real point was to point out that he thought the article was not an objective piece.36
Miscavige also alleged on Nightline that the article itself was published from a request by Eli Lilly, due to: &quot;the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac.&quot; When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded: &quot;You think they'd admit it?&quot; Miscavige also stated that: &quot;Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of Time magazine before it came out,&quot; and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful.37
Litigation
 The Church brought a libel lawsuit against Time Warner and Richard Behar, seeking damages of USD$416 million.3839 The Church alleged false and defamatory statements were made concerning the Church of Scientology International in the TIME article.40 More specifically, the Church of Scientology's court statements indicated it claimed that Behar had been refining an anti-Scientology focus since his 1986 article in Forbes, which included gathering negative materials about Scientology, and &quot;never accepting anything a Scientologist said and uniformly ignoring anything positive he learned about the Church.&quot;41 In its initial complaint filing, the Church quoted portions of the Behar article that it alleged were false and defamatory, including the quote from Cynthia Kisser, and Behar's own assertion that Scientology was a &quot;global racket&quot; that intimidated individuals in a &quot;Mafia-like manner.&quot;42
Noah Lottick's parents submitted affidavits in the case, in which they: &quot;affirmed the accuracy of each statement in the article,&quot; and stated that Dr. Lottick &quot;concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations, and that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral [of their son.]&quot;43 During the litigation, the Church of Scientology attempted to subpoena Richard Behard in a separate ongoing lawsuit with the Internal Revenue Service, and also accused a federal magistrate of leaking information to him.44 Behar was questioned for over one-hundred and ninety hours during thirty days of depositions with Scientology attorneys in the libel case.45 One question was about Behar's life in his parent's home while he was still inside the womb, which the St. Petersburg Times explained as a reference to Scientology teachings that certain problems come from prenatal memories.46 Behar was quoted in the St. Petersburg Times, and stated: &quot;I felt it was extremely excessive.&quot;47 In a countersuit, Behar brought up the issues of Church of Scientology private investigators and what he viewed as harassment.4849 By July, 1996, all counts of the libel suit had been dismissed.5051 In the course of the litigation through 1996, Time Warner had spent USD$3.7 million in legal defense costs.52 The Church of Scientology also sued several individuals who had been quoted in the TIME article.53
The Church of Scientology also sued Reader's Digest in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany for publishing a condensed version of the Time story.54 A court in Lausanne, Switzerland was the only court to provide a temporary injunction.55 In France, Italy and the Netherlands, the courts had either dismissed the Church of Scientology's motions, or set injunction hearings far beyond the date of actual publication.56 The company defied the injunction and mailed copies of the article, entitled: &quot;Scientology: A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream,&quot; to their 326,000 Swiss subscribers.57 Worldwide editor-in-chief of the Reader's Digest, Kenneth Tomlinson, was quoted in The New York Times, stating: &quot;A publisher cannot accept a court prohibiting distribution of a serious journalistic piece..The court order violates freedom of speech and freedom of the press.&quot;58 The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the Digest in Lausanne, and Mike Rinder stated it was in blatant violation of the law.59 By defying the Swiss court ban, the Reader's Digest risked a fine of about USD$3,400, as well as a potential three months of jail time for the Swiss Digest editor-in-chief.60 A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11, 2001, and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court.6162
 In January 2001, a United States Federal Appeals Court upheld the dismissal of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner.63 In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; with an actual intent of malice.64 Intention of malice is a standard that must be shown for libel cases involving individuals and public groups.65 On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case: Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc., 00-1683.6667 Time Warner had stated that it refused to be &quot;intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources.&quot;68 In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had &quot;committed improper acts&quot; in the past, but also claimed that: &quot;allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, the result of the misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion.&quot;69 Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they: &quot;provide a safe harbor for biased journalism.&quot;70
Awards
As a result of writing the piece, Richard Behar was presented with the 1992 Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism, the Worth Bingham Prize, the Conscience in Media Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, awarded to: &quot;those who have demonstrated singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice,&quot; and the Leo J. Ryan Award, in honor of Congressman Leo J. Ryan.7172737475 Paulette Cooper was also awarded the 1992 Conscience-in-Media Award by the American Society of Journalists and Authors, for her book The Scandal of Scientology.76
In a February 1992 issue of TIME, editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Richard Behar on his Conscience in Media Award, stating: &quot;Needless to say, we are delighted and proud.&quot;77 Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence.78 Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar, in an April 1992 issue of TIME.79
Analysis
Several secondary sources have commented on the article, and used it as a reference for background on Scientology.8081 However, not all analysis of the article has been positive. Healy's book criticizing the pharmaceutical industry, Let Them Eat Prozac, described the TIME article as over the top, saying that: &quot;Even Saddam Hussein was portrayed less badly.&quot; Healy addressed the article's claim that lawsuits were one of the Church's key tactics against enemies. He noted that the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a Church of Scientology affiliated group discussed in the article, had filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration inquiring what it was going to do about Prozac. Healy dismissed the notion that CCHR engaged in &quot;orchestrated campaigns,&quot; writing that very few of the fifty lawsuits filed against Prozac were related to the Church of Scientology.82 Mark Silk criticized Behar's article, in his book Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America.83 Silk classified the work among what he referred to as the &quot;false-prophecy topos,&quot; and characterized Behar's account of Noah Lottick's suicide as an atrocity tale.84
Insane Therapy characterized the piece as a &quot;highly critical article&quot; on Scientology.&quot;85 Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality described the cover design of the article as it appeared in TIME, writing that it &quot;shouted&quot; the headline from the magazine cover.86 In a 2005 piece, Salon.com magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the TIME article still remains a &quot;milestone in news coverage,&quot; and stated that those who back the Church believe it was &quot;an outrageously biased account.&quot;87
Legacy
The Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in The Boston Herald, and compared to Richard Behar's experiences when researching &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power.&quot; After a five-part series of critical articles ran in the paper in 1998, Church of Scientology President Heber Jentzsch confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of the reporter who wrote the articles. In a later piece called: &quot;Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter - Investigation follows pattern of harassment,&quot; this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporter's experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997.88
Due to the controversial history between the Readers Digest and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on Tom Cruise agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course.89 Also in 2005, an article in Salon cited the Church of Scientology's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources that criticized Scientology, and posed the question if these tactics had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press.90 A 2005 article in The Sunday Times cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner &quot;served to warn off other potential investigations.&quot;91
&quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; continues to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology.9293 In April 2007, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder live, in a piece on Anderson Cooper 360 entitled: &quot;Inside Scientology.&quot;94 The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC Panorama investigative program, &quot;Scientology and Me.&quot; In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; article, when asking Rinder about the history of Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church.95 Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was &quot;ancient history.&quot; Cooper then again referenced the TIME magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article.96 Cooper also questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner, and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually thrown out.97
The article has also been cited as a reference used for background on Scientology in books which take a critical look at cults such as Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality and Insane Therapy: Portrait of a Psychotherapy Cult,9899 those that analyze new religious movements including Understanding New Religious Movements and The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements,100101 and also in a work that includes researchers from both schools of thought, Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field.102
