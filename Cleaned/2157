 The upper nobility (, ) was the highest stratum of the temporal society in the Kingdom of Hungary until the 20th century. In the course of the 11-15th centuries, only people who held specific high offices in the royal administration or in the Royal Households were distinguished by law within the nobility, but from the 16th century, families whose ancestors had been authorized by the monarchs to use a distinctive noble title (e.g., baron, count) formed a hereditary social class.
Its first members descended from the leaders of the Magyar tribes and clans and from the western knights who immigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary in the course of the 10-12th centuries. They were the &quot;men distinguished by birth and dignity&quot; (maiores natu et dignitate) mentioned frequently in the charters of the first kings. From the 1210s, the dignitaries of the central administration and the Royal Households were referred to as &quot;barons of the realm&quot; (barones regni) in official documents but their legal status was exclusively linked to the office they held and their offsprings could not inherit it.
 In 1193, King B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la III granted Modru&lt;U+0161&gt; county in Croatia to Bartolomej, the ancestor of the Frankopans (Frangep&lt;U+00E1&gt;n) family; thenceforward, he and his descendants used the hereditary title count but no specific privileges were connected to it. Quite to the contrary, the theory of the &quot;one and same liberty&quot; (una eademque libertas) of the nobles strengthened and finally, it became enacted in 1351. From 1397, the descendants of the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; were referred to as &quot;barons' sons&quot; (filii baronum) or magnates (magnates) in official documents and from the 1430s, they received the honorific magnificus, an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the &quot;barons of the realm&quot;.
 Besides the Counts Frankopan, the members of foreign ruling houses and the nobles of foreign origin who held offices in the royal administration or owned estates in the Kingdom of Hungary (e.g., Duke Ladislaus of Opole, Prince Fyodor Koriatovych, the Despot Stefan Lazarevi&lt;U+0107&gt; and Count Hermann II of Celje) were the first individuals who used noble titles, but in theory, their legal status was still equal to that of the poorest members of the lesser nobility. Similarly, the status of the brothers Szentgy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgyi did not change when they were rewarded with the hereditary title count of the Roman Empire in 1459 by Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor who had been claiming the throne for himself against King Matthias I.
 King Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles when he appointed them to hereditary heads of counties (h&lt;U+00E6&gt;reditarius supremus comes) and authorized them to use red sealing wax (similarly to the counts of the Roman Empire). In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of armistice signed by King Matthias: the document mentioned 19 noble families as &quot;natural barons in Hungary&quot; (barones naturales in Hungaria) in contrast to the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; whose position was still linked to the high offices they happened to be holding. During the reign of King Vladislaus II, the special legal position of certain noble families was enacted and the act referred to their members as &quot;barons&quot; even if they were not holding any high offices at that time.
Although in the 16th century, the Tripartitum (a law book collecting the body of common laws that had arisen from customary practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practise, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the Tripartitum still distinguished between the &quot;true barons&quot; (veri barones) who held the highest offices and the &quot;barons only by name&quot; (barones solo nomine) who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles. From 1526, the Habsburg kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as baron and count and the members of the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the Diets. This costumary practise was confirmed by legislation in 1608, when the Diet passed an act prescribing that the monarchs were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (i.e., to the &quot;true barons&quot; and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the prelates and the members of the upper nobility formed the Diets' Upper House.
 The Habsburg monarchs endeavoured to establish an &quot;international&quot; aristocracy within their empire and they granted several estates in the Kingdom of Hungary to their followers descending from their other realms and provinces; the Estates, however, managed to reserve the right that the kings could not grant offices and estates to foreigners without their authorization. From 1688, the members of the upper nobility were entitled by law to create an entail (fideicommissum) which ensured that their estates were inherited without division in contrast to the common law that prescribed that a noble's inheritance was to be divided equally among his heirs.
 The &quot;cardinal liberties&quot; of the nobility were abolished by the &quot;April laws&quot; in 1848, but the members of the upper nobility could reserve their hereditary membership in the Upper House of the Parliament. In 1885, aristocrats who did not meet all the financial criteria set up by legislation, lost their seat in the legislative body. The Upper House was dissolved in 1918 and it was reorganized only in 1926, but thenceforward, the members of the upper nobility were only entitled to elect some representatives to the Upper House.
In 1945, the land reform liquidated the financial basis of the special status of the upper nobility. And finally, following the declaration of the Republic of Hungary, the Parliament passed an act that prohibited the use of noble titles in 1946.
The tribal aristocracy (9th&lt;U+2013&gt;11th centuries)
In the 9th century, the tribal federation of the nomadic Magyars (Hetumoger) was composed of seven (and later, after the Kabars had joined to it, of eight) tribes (, ).1 The tribes were divided into 35-50 clans (, ).2 The Magyar clans must have been organized based on the real or fictitious kinship of their members; each of them had its own name (that may have been changing from time to time) and the clans possessed separate territories within the lands occupied by the tribe they were linked to.3 In the 9th-10th centuries, the kende, the gyula and the horka were the leaders of the Magyar tribal federation, while the tribes were headed by their own princes and each clan must have also had its own head.45
 The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos recorded that6 
Around 896, the Magyars invaded the Carpathian Basin and by 902, they occupied its whole territory.7 The Magyars made several raids to the territories of present-day Italy, Germany, France and Spain and also to the lands of the Byzantine Empire.89 The regular raids contributed to the differentiation of the tribal society because the leaders of the military actions were entitled to reserve a higher share of the booty for themselves.10 The military actions also contributed to the formation of the retinues of the heads of the tribes and the clans.11 The Magyars were obliged to stop their regular military actions westwards following their defeat at the Battle of Augsburg on the Lech River in 955; and in 970, the raids against the Byzantine Empire also finished.12
 When the period of the military raids closed, the organization of the future Kingdom of Hungary commenced during the reign of Grand Prince G&lt;U+00E9&gt;za (before 972-997) who united the western parts of the Carpathian Basin under his rule.13 The establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary is connected to King Saint Stephen (1000/1001-1038); he defeated the (semi-)independent Magyar tribal leaders who endeavoured to resist his rule and thus he managed to expand his authority over the whole territory of the Carpathian Basin by the 1030s.14 King Stephen I organized several &quot;counties&quot; that became the basic units of the royal administration.15 Some scholars16 claim that King Stephen I organized the &quot;counties&quot; on the basis of the territories possessed by the clans, but other authors17 pointed out that the relationship between the &quot;counties&quot; and the Magyar clans cannot be proven.18
King Saint Stephen's acts ensured the private ownership of landed property; therefore, several families of the tribal aristocracy (i.e., the families of the heads of the tribes and clans) acquired the ownership of parts of the lands their clans had previously possessed.19 Consequently, several families of the future upper nobility descended from the tribal leaders who had surrendered to King Stephen I (e.g., the Aba and Cs&lt;U+00E1&gt;k families), and even the descendants of some rebellious tribal leaders (e.g., the kindred of Ajtony) could reserve a part of their ancestor's estates.20
Although King Stephen I made a concerted effort to strengthen the position of Christianity in his kingdom and he adopted severe measures against the followers of pagan customs, but several Magyar tribal leaders (including the king's nephew Levente, who died as a pagan around 1046) did not give up their former lifestyle.21 
On the other hand, the Christian missionaries' efforts were not in vain, and several members of the tribal aristocracy (e.g., Csan&lt;U+00E1&gt;d, one of Ajtony's former military leaders) became an ardent advocate of the Christianity; and finally, all of them who could reserve their estates integrated into the upper stratum of the Christian society following the period of the internal wars in the 1040s.2223 
The immigrant knights (10-13th centuries)
The first knights from the western countries (mainly from the provinces of the Holy Roman Empire) arrived to Hungary during the reign of Grand Prince G&lt;U+00E9&gt;za in the 990s and he granted several estates to them on his domains.24 In 997, the future King Saint Stephen could gain a victory over Kopp&lt;U+00E1&gt;ny (his relative who claimed the throne for himself after the death of Grand Prince G&lt;U+00E9&gt;za) with the assistance of the foreign knights serving in his German wife's retinues.25 The arrival of the immigrant (, ) knights continued until the end of the 13th century; several of them (e.g., the brothers Hont and P&lt;U+00E1&gt;zm&lt;U+00E1&gt;ny) were invited by the monarchs who offered them estates in their kingdom; others arrived in the retinues of the queens of foreign origin; while some of them was obliged to leave their country and seek shelter in the kingdom.26 Most of the immigrant knights were horse-mounted men-at-arms thus the maintenance of their equipment required considerable financial resources that was ensured by grant of estates.27 
Dignitaries and office-holders (11-13th centuries)
The formation of the Royal Council
 The kings' (and their queens') retinues and the Royal Households became the centres where the merger of the tribal aristocracy and the immigrant knights occurred (mainly by inter-marriages) in the course of the 11-12th centuries.28 The decrees of King Stephen I contain clear references to the &quot;men distinguished by birth and dignity&quot; (, ) who can be identified with the immigrant knights and the members of the tribal aristocracy who held the highest offices at his court and in the royal administration.29 They formed, together with the prelates, the Royal Council (, ) which became the highest forum of political decision-making in the kingdom.30  Nevertheless, the monarchs remained the biggest landowners in the country until the end of the 12th century and the scattered lands owned even by the wealthiest members of the kings' retinues did not form contiguous geographical units in the kingdom.31 Based on their financial recources, the monarchs could reserve their overwhelming authority within their kingdom in the course of the 11-12th centuries: during the reign of King G&lt;U+00E9&gt;za II (1141&lt;U+2013&gt;1162), the Bishop Otto of Freising recorded that all the Hungarians 
The heads of counties
 Among the members of the monarchs' retinues, the heads of the counties (, ) enjoyed a distinguished position: they managed the royal revenues of the &quot;counties&quot; and they were entitled to one third of the revenues; moreover, they led their own retinues attached to their office.32 They enjoyed several privileges; e.g., in their cases, the judgement was to be passed by the monarchs in person.33
The &quot;isp&lt;U+00E1&gt;ns&quot; became the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in the country, but their appointment and dismissal depended exclusively upon the kings' favour and therefore, they could not form a hereditary aristocracy.34 Their financial conditions ensured that they could set up monasteries and grant possessions to them. These &quot;private monasteries&quot; not only served for burial place to the founder's family but their founder often reserved the &quot;right of patronage&quot; (, ) for himself and for his descendants.35
The high-officers of the realm and of the Royal Households
 The first references to an organized entourage around the monarchs were recorded during the reign of King Andrew I (1046&lt;U+2013&gt;1060), but the development of the Royal Household (, ) must have commenced earlier.36 The existence of a separate Household of the Queens was documented for the first time in the 1190s.37
The gradual development of the Royal Households contributed to the establishment of a hierarchical structure within the nobility, because their high-officers held the highest positions within the kingdom.38 In practice, they not only fulfilled their duties within the Royal Households but also became heads of &quot;counties&quot;, probably because no specific revenues were attached to their offices in the Royal Households.39
The decrees of King Ladislaus I (1077&lt;U+2013&gt;1095) referred to them as &quot;notabilities&quot; (, ) or &quot;nobles&quot; (, ).40 From 1216, the royal charters began to use the expression &quot;barons of the realm&quot; (, ) when referring to the dignitaries which prove that they wanted to distinguish themselves from other nobles (e.g., from the heads of counties).41 They, however, could not form a hereditary aristocracy, because their title was still linked to the offices they held and the monarchs had the power to dismiss them and to promote others at any time.4243
Some of the high-officers commenced to fulfil judiciary functions and thus they got rid of their administrative duties within the Royal Households.44 These high-judges and the governors of certain provinces (e.g., Transylvania, Croatia, Slavonia) formed together the high-officers of the realm who enjoyed a distinguished position within the nobility:45
the Palatine (, ) administered the Royal Household in the 11-12th centuries, but later, the Palatines held the highest judiciary position within the kingdom;464748
the Judge of the Realm (, ) appeared in the documents around 1130, probably as the Palatine's deputy but later, the Judges of the Realm had their own sphere of jurisdiction;4950
the office of the Voivode of Transylvania (, ) developed from the office of the heads of Feh&lt;U+00E9&gt;r county and its denomination was changing before the 13th century, but thenceforward, the voivodes governed Transylvania and they appointed the heads of the &quot;counties&quot; in the province;5152
the Ban of Slavonia (, ) was the governor of Slavonia from the 12th century;5354
the Ban of Dalmatia and Croatia (, ) governed the two kingdoms occupied by the kings of Hungary at the beginning of the 12th century;5556
the Ban of Macs&lt;U+00F3&gt; (, ) administered the territories of the Macs&lt;U+00F3&gt; (today Ma&lt;U+010D&gt;va in Serbia) region from the 1270s;5758
the Ban of Sz&lt;U+00F6&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny governed the territories attached to the Kingdom of Hungary around the Castle of Sz&lt;U+00F6&gt;r&lt;U+00E9&gt;ny (today Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania) in the 1220s;5960
the Master of the Treasury (, ) took over the financial functions of the Judge of the Realm in the 12th century but later, the t&lt;U+00E1&gt;rnokmesters' own sphere of jurisdiction also developed.61
The list of the high-officers of the Royal Households was developing gradually from the 11th century, and their functions also changed from time to time, but by the end of the 13th century, their hierarchy become consolidated:62
the Marshal (, ) was the head of the royal stablemen from the 11th century and later, he led the royal armies;63
the Master of the Cup-bearers (, ) served wine at the kings' table and he administered the activities of the royal wine-growers;64
the Master of the Stewards (, ) served dishes at the monarch's table.65
the Master of huissiers (, Latin : magister janitorum) 66
The emerging power of the feudal barons (13th century)
King B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la III (1172&lt;U+2013&gt;1196) was the first monarch who alienated a whole county when he granted the ownership of all the royal estates in Modru&lt;U+0161&gt; county to Bartolomej, who became the ancestor of the Frankopan () family.67 In his grant, the king stipulated that the Counts Frankopan would be obliged to arm some horse-mounted knights for the monarchs.68
King Andrew II (1205&lt;U+2013&gt;1235) radically changed the internal policy his predecessors had been following and he started to grant enormous domains to his partisans.69 He not only alienated castles and whole counties (i.e., the royal estates attached to them), but he also made &quot;perpetual grants&quot; (, ) that passed not only from fathers to sons (or in the lack of sons, to brothers or their sons) but all the male members of owner's family could inherited them.70 From the 1220s, several individuals commenced to refer to their clan in the official documents by using the expression de genere (&quot;from the kindred of&quot;) following their name which suggests that the relevance even of distant kinship started to increase.71
The king's new policy endangered the liberties of the royal servants owning landed property in the counties that the king had granted to his partisans.72 Therefore, in 1222, the royal servants led by former &quot;barons of the realm&quot; who had been dismissed by King Andrew II enforced the king to issue the Golden Bull in order to ensure their liberties.7374 In the Golden Bull, the king also promised that he and his successors would not grant offices to foreigners without the consent of the Royal Council.75 The first precedent when the nobles decided on a foreigner's reception into the nobility of the kingdom was set during reign the reign of King Andrew III (1290&lt;U+2013&gt;1301), when in 1298, the assembly of the nobility authorized the king to grant an office in the royal administration to his uncle, the Venetian Albertino Morosini.76
The last provision of the Golden Bull authorized the prelates and the &quot;nobles&quot; to resist any royal measures that could endanger their liberties confirmed by his decree.77
 Following the Mongol invasion of the kingdom in 1241-42, King B&lt;U+00E9&gt;la IV endeavoured the landowners to build strongholds in their domains and therefore, he often granted lands to his partisans and obliged them to have a fortress built there.78 As a consequence, at least 75% of the 162 fortresses built in the kingdom from 1242 until 1300 was erected on private estates.79 The maintenance of the fortresses required significant financial resources and therefore, the scattered character of landed property went under a radical change because the strongholds became the centres of bigger units of estates that consisted of the villages attached to them.80 The possession of one or more strongholds strengthened the position of the upper nobility, because the castle-owners could resist the monarchs for a longer period and they could also expand their influence over the owners of smaller estates around their castles.81 Based on their fortresses and retinues, the wealthier members of the landed nobility endeavoured to strengthen their own position and they often rebelled against the monarchs.82 They began to employ the members of the lesser nobility in their households and thus the latter (mentioned as familiaris in the deeds) became subordinate to them.83 A familiaris (servant) had to swear fidelity to his dominus (lord) and he fell under his lord's jurisdiction with regard to any cases connected to their special relationship.84 On the other hand, a familiaris reserved the ownership of his former estates and in this regard, he still fell under the jurisdiction of the royal courts of justice.85
 From the 1290s, the most powerful barons commenced to govern their domains de facto independently of the monarchs and they usurped the royal prerogatives on the enormous territories possessed by them or by their familiaris.86 Following the death of King Andrew III, the largest part of the kingdom became subject to the de facto rule of oligarchs like M&lt;U+00E1&gt;t&lt;U+00E9&gt; Cs&lt;U+00E1&gt;k, Amade Aba and Ladislaus K&lt;U+00E1&gt;n who took advantage of the struggles among the claimants to the throne and expanded their supremacy to several counties.87 King Charles I Robert (1308&lt;U+2013&gt;1342) had to spend the first decades of his reign in waging wars against the most powerful oligarchs and he could strengthen his position within the kingdom only by the 1320s.88
The age of chivalry (14th century)
The estates King Charles I Robert acquired by force from the rebellious oligarchs made him possible to introduce a new system in the royal administration: when he appointed his followers to an office, he also granted them the possession of one or more royal castles and the royal domains attached to them, but he reserved the ownership of the castle and its belongings for himself and thus his dignitaries could only enjoy the revenues of their possessions while they held the office.89 During his reign, the 20 dignitaries who held the highest offices in the royal administration or in the Royal Household obtained the honorific magnificus vir that distinguished them from other nobles.90
 During his reign, members of new families attained the status of &quot;barons of the realm&quot;; some of the ancestors of the new families (e.g., that of the Drugeths) arrived from abroad and some of them were members of the lesser nobility (e.g., the ancestor of the &lt;U+00DA&gt;jlaki family), but the majority of the new families (e.g., the Garai, Sz&lt;U+00E9&gt;cs&lt;U+00E9&gt;nyi and Sz&lt;U+00E9&gt;csi families) descended from clans whose members had already held high-offices in the 13th century.9192
The king introduced a new royal prerogative in 1332 when he entitled Margaret de genere N&lt;U+00E1&gt;dasd to inherit her father's possessions in contradiction to the costums of the kingdom prescribing that daughters can inherit only one-fourth of their father's estates and the other parts of the estates should pass to his agnates.93 Thenceforward, the monarchs could strengthen the financial conditions of their followers by using the prerogative of &quot;putting her into a son's place&quot; (, ) and thus entitling their wives to inherit their fathers' possessions.94 King Charles I Robert also set himself against the costums of the kingdom, when he granted landed property to his followers but he stipulated that the property could only be inherited by their descendants and thus he excluded their agnates from the inheritance.95
King Charles I Robert endeavoured the implementation of the ideas of chivalry; in 1318, he established the Order of Saint George whose membership was limited to 50 knights.9697 He also set up the body of &quot;knights-at-the-court&quot; (, ) who acted as his personal delegates on an ad hoc basis.98 Thenceforward, most of the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; were appointed among the knights-at-the court.99 Before being knighted, children of the upper nobility could serve as pages (, ) in the Royal Households, and when they grow up they became &quot;juveniles-at-the court&quot; (, ).100101 King Charles I Robert was the first king of Hungary who granted crests to his followers; the Hungarian word for coat-of-arms (c&lt;U+00ED&gt;mer) derives from the French expression for the crest (cimier).102
In 1351, King Louis I (1342&lt;U+2013&gt;1382) issued a new decree that modified the Golden Bull and introduced the entail system (, ) when regulating the inheritance of the nobles' estates; according to the new system, the nobles' real property could not be devised by will, but it passed by operation of law to the owner's heirs upon his death.103 During his reign, the members of the Bebek, Cudar and Lackfi families attained the status of &quot;baron of the realm&quot;.104
The rule of the barons' leagues
 Following the death of King Louis I, his daughter Queen Mary I (1382&lt;U+2013&gt;1385, 1386&lt;U+2013&gt;1395) acceded to the throne, but the majority of the nobles opposed her rule.105 In 1385, the young queen had to abdicate in favor of her distant cousin, King Charles II (1385&lt;U+2013&gt;1386), but her partisans murdered the new king soon and thus she could ascend the throne again.106 However, the followers of her murdered opponent's son, King Ladislaus of Naples rose up in open rebellion and captured her; thus the realm stayed without a monarch.107
At that moment, the prelates and the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; set up a council; they have a seal prepared with the inscription &quot;Seal of the People of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot; () and issued decrees sealed by it in the name of the &quot;prelates, barons, notabilities and all nobles of the realm&quot;.108 The members of the council entered into a contract with Queen Mary's fianc&lt;U+00E9&gt; and elected him king; in the contract, King Sigismund (1387&lt;U+2013&gt;1437) accepted that his The contract also recorded that the king and his counsillors would form a league and according to their contract, the king could not dismiss his counsillors without the consent of the other members of the Royal Council.109 The contract suggests that the members of the Royal Council endeavored to strengthen the hereditary character of their position.110 The first league was led by the Palatine Stephen II Lackfi and the Archbishop John Kanizsai, but the latter could drive the former out of the power in 1397.111 However, King Sigismund favorized his counsillors of foreign origin (e.g., his favourite was the Polish Stibor of Stiboricz) which resulted in his imprisonment, in 1401, by the discontent members of the Royal Council led by the Archbishop John Kanizsai, but he managed to conclude a new agreement with some members of the Royal Council who set him free.112
 The public law of the kingdom also started to differentiate the descendants of the &quot;barons of the realm&quot;, even if they did not held any higher offices, from other nobles: the Act of 1397 referred to them as the &quot;barons' sons&quot; (, ) while later documents called them &quot;magnates&quot; (, ). From the 1430s, the &quot;magnates&quot; received the honorific magnificus, an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the &quot;barons of the realm&quot;.113
During his reign, King Sigismund granted several royal castles and the royal domains attached to them to the members of the barons' leagues; by 1407, the number of royal castles decreased from 111 to 66.114 The king, however, wanted to strengthen his position and for this purpose, in 1408, he founded the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order whose 22 members (e.g., the Palatine Nicholas II Garai, count Hermann II of Celje and the Despot Stefan Lazarevi&lt;U+0107&gt;) swore fidelity to the king, his queen and their future children.115116
Some signs of the increasing self-consciousness of the &quot;magnates&quot; appeared in the 1420s.117 Some of them commenced to use names that referred to the high office their ancestors had held; e.g., the members of the Losonci family started to call themselves B&lt;U+00E1&gt;nfi meaning the &quot;son of a Ban&quot; in reference to their forefather who had been the Ban of Dalmatia and Croatia.118 Other magnates clearly referred to their descent from former &quot;barons of the realm&quot; in their deeds or used noble titles (such as &quot;count&quot; or &quot;duke&quot;) abroad following the example of the western nobility although the public law of the kingdom did not accept their claim to distinctive titles.119
When King Sigismund's son-in-law, Albert I (1437&lt;U+2013&gt;1439) was proclaimed king, he had to take a solemn oath that he would exercise his prerogative powers only with the consent of the Royal Council.120 Following King Albert's death, a civil war broke out between the followers of his posthumous son, King Ladislaus V (1440&lt;U+2013&gt;1457) and the partisans of his opponent, King Vladislaus I (1440&lt;U+2013&gt;1444).121 Between 1440 and 1458, the Diet was convoked in each year (with the exception of 1443 and 1449) and it was involved in the legislative process of law-making: the bills were passed by the Diet before receiving the Royal Assent.122 When the monarch (or the regent) convoked the Diet, he sent a personal invitation to the prelates, &quot;barons of the realm&quot; and &quot;magnates&quot; and they attended in person at the assembly, while other nobles were usually represented by their deputies.123 Consequently, the Diets were dominated by the &quot;magnates&quot; not only because of their personal presence, but also because of the tendency that the counties elected their partisans as their own delegates.124
In 1445, the Diet elected seven Captains General (, ) in order to govern the kingdom during the absence of King Vladislaus I (who actually had fallen in the Battle of Varna).125 In 1446, the assembly of the Estates proclaimed John Hunyadi to Regent and he was to govern the realm in cooperation with the Estates until 1453 when King Ladislaus V returned to the kingdom.126
John Hunyadi was the first temporal &quot;magnate&quot; who received a hereditary title from a king of Hungary: in 1453, King Ladislaus V appointed him the hereditary head (, ) of Beszterce county (now Bistri&lt;U+0163&gt;a in Romania) and thus he became a count in the sense similar to the title's usage in the western countries.127 Although, some of the immigrant &quot;magnates&quot;128 had already used honorary titles before and they were often mentioned even in official documents with a reference to their title,129 but their title was granted by foreign monarchs and the public law in the Kingdom of Hungary did not recognize any special privileges connected to it.
The legal separation of the hereditary aristocracy
 John Hunyadi's son, Matthias I (1458&lt;U+2013&gt;1490) was proclaimed to king by the Estates, but he had to wage war against Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor who claimed the throne for himself.130 Several magnates supported the emperor's claim and proclaimed him to king against King Matthias; the emperor rewarded the brothers Sigismund and John of Szentgy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgy and Bazin with the hereditary noble title &quot;count of the Holy Roman Empire&quot; in 1459 and thus they became entitled to use red sealing wax.131132 Although the Counts Szentgy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgyi commenced to use their title in their deeds, but in the Kingdom of Hungary, public law did not distinguish them from other nobles.133
King Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles and appointed them hereditary heads of counties: John Vitovec became the hereditary head of Zagorje county in 1463; Emeric Szapolyai received the honor of Szepes county in 1465; in 1467, Nicholas Csupor de Monoszl&lt;U+00F3&gt; and John Ernuszt were appointed to hereditary head of Ver&lt;U+0151&gt;ce county and Tur&lt;U+00F3&gt;c county respectively; in the 1480s, Nicholas B&lt;U+00E1&gt;nffy de Als&lt;U+00F3&gt;lendva and Peter and Matthias Ger&lt;U+00E9&gt;b received such hereditary titles.134135 The hereditary heads of counties were entitled, similarly to the &quot;counts of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;, to use red sealing was.136 Moreover, during his reign, all the members of the wealthier families descending from the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; received the honorific magnificus which was a next step towards their separation from other nobles.137
 In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of armistice signed by King Matthias: 18 families138 were referred to as &quot;natural barons of Hungary&quot; (, ) in contrast to the &quot;barons of the realm&quot; who were still the holders of the highest offices in the public administration and the Royal Households.139 One of the 19 families (the &lt;U+00DA&gt;jlaki family) was styled &quot;duke&quot; in the deed, while other four families were styled &quot;count&quot; - the latter group included the Szentgy&lt;U+00F6&gt;rgyi family which suggests that King Matthias accepted the title his opponent had granted to them.140
During the reign of King Vladislaus II (1490&lt;U+2013&gt;1516), the Diet unambiguosly expressed that certain noble families141 were in a distinguished position and mentioned them as barons irrespectively of the office they held.142 The Diet prescribed that the barons were to arm soldiers pursuant to the number of the landed villeins who lived on their domains which prove that by that time, public law had acknowledged their special legal status and their privilege to use distinctive titles.143
