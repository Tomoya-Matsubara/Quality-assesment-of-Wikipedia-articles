Su-Yun_Hong is a boxer1 from Seoul, South Korea whose foray into boxing escalated into a series of championship-fighting performances.2 Eventually, she developed her jabs and counter punches to become a well rounded fighter and who opts to keep a low profile inside the ring to catch her opponents with their guard down and deploy a strong right uppercut. She became more serious about boxing in 2010 when she signed a contract with her boxing label to become a professional.3
