Turgenev Library () is a Russian public library located in Paris, founded in 18755.1 It is one of the oldest Russian-language libraries outside of Russia.
The initiative of library for Russian-speaking emigrants in Paris belonged to German Alexandrovich Lopatin,2 a notable follower of Narodnik movement. The idea was not to create just a book depository, but the center for consolidation for revolutionary youth in France. Because Lopatin has no means for its foundation, he addressed to Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev, who lived in Paris at that time. Turgenev's personal books formed a basis for the new library. On February 15, 1875, Turgenev orginised a matinee, which brought together many prominent cultural workers from Paris: Ilya Repin, Vasily Polenov, Sergey Makovsky, Mark Antokolski, and the Ambassodor of the Russian Empire in France Nikolay Alexeyevich Orlov. As a result there were collected 2000 francs, which were used for buying books and rent the premises for the library. In 1883 Turgenev died, and the library was named after him.
Despite the financial difficulties, the library's holdings was continuously replenishing. It has 3500 volumes in 1900, 17000 -- in 1913, 50000 -- in 1925, and 100,000 -- in 1937. After 1917 Russian Revolution the library became one of the most principal centers of White &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt; culture. In 1937 the library got the splendid premises in XV-century mansion, the so-called H&lt;U+00F4&gt;tel Colbert in Rue de la B&lt;U+00FB&gt;cherie. The library kept valuable rarities: the first printings of Voltaire, Fran&lt;U+00E7&gt;ois de La Rochefoucauld, Nikolay Karamzin, Sudebnik of tsar Ivan IV (with the comments of Vasily Tatishchev).
The library was practically destroyed during the World War II. In October, 1940, all books, pictures and portraits, busts were placed un 900 boxes and taken to unknown direction.
Turgenev Library was partially restored and reopened in 1959.3 In 1991 it housed 40,000 volumes. Paris Municipality provides financial assistance for the library.
