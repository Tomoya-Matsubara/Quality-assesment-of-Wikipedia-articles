The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion (also known as the Stone House, the William R. Ricketts House, and Ganoga) is a Georgian style house made of sandstone, built in 1851&lt;U+2013&gt;1852 on the shore of Ganoga Lake in Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was home to several generations of the Ricketts family, including R. Bruce Ricketts and William Reynolds Ricketts, and served as part of a hotel for much of the 19th century. The house was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1936 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1983. A group of investors bought the lake, surrounding land, and house in 1957 and developed them privately for housing and recreation. The house became the Ganoga Lake Association's clubhouse, and is not open to the public.
The 1852 mansion is an L-shaped structure, two-and-a-half stories high, with stone walls  thick. It was built in a clearing surrounded by old-growth forest with a view to the lake  to the east. In 1913 a two-and-a-half story wing was added to the north side of the house and the original structure was renovated. The house has twenty eight rooms, four porches, and its original hardware and woodwork. Dormers and some windows were added in the renovation, and electrical wiring and modern plumbing have been added since. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion &quot;is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture&quot;.1
Location
The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion is on the southwest shore of Ganoga Lake in Colley Township in the southeast part of Sullivan County. The house and lake are on a part of the Allegheny Plateau known as North Mountain; the plateau formed about 300 to 250 million years ago in the Alleghenian orogeny. Rocks&lt;U+2014&gt;gray sandstone with conglomerates and some siltstone&lt;U+2014&gt;of the Mississippian Pocono Formation more than 340 million years old, underlie the house and lake.2 The lake is in a shallow valley,  deep, which is impounded by glacial till up to  thick at the southeast end, where Kitchen Creek exits.3
The earliest recorded inhabitants of the region were the Susquehannocks, who left or died out by 1675. The land then came under the control of the Iroquois, who sold it to the British in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.4 The land on which the house was later built was first part of Northumberland County, then became part of Lycoming County in 1795.5 The Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between 1822 and 1827; it connected the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north.678 Sullivan County was formed from Lycoming County in 1847, and two years later Colley Township was formed from Cherry Township.9
History
 Brothers Clemuel Ricketts (1794&lt;U+2013&gt;1858) and Elijah G. Ricketts (1803&lt;U+2013&gt;1877) bought Ganoga Lake and  of surrounding land in 1851. They were frustrated at having to spend the night on a hotel's parlor floor while on a hunting trip on Loyalsock Creek north of the lake in 1850, and wanted their own hunting preserve. They started building a stone house on the lake shore in 1851 and finished it the next year. The stone house, which served as their lodge and as a tavern for travelers on the turnpike, was known as &quot;Ricketts Folly&quot; for its isolated location in the wilderness. When Clemuel died in 1858, Elijah bought his share of the house and land.1011
Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts (1839&lt;U+2013&gt;1918), for whom Ricketts Glen State Park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. B. Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and purchased the stone house, lake, and some of the land around it from his father in September 1869; eventually he controlled or owned more than , including the lake and the park's glens and waterfalls.1213
 From 1872 to 1875 Ricketts and his partners operated a sawmill  southeast of his house. In 1872 Ricketts used lumber from the mill to build a three-story wooden addition next to the stone house. The North Mountain House hotel opened in 1873, and was managed by Ricketts' brother Frank until 1898. Many of the guests, who came from Wilkes-Barre, Philadelphia, New York City, and other places, were Ricketts friends and relations. Guests frequently arrived after school let out in June and stayed all summer until school resumed in September. In 1876 and 1877, Ricketts ran the first summer school in the United States at his house and hotel; one of the teachers was Joseph Rothrock, later known as the &quot;Father of Forestry&quot; in Pennsylvania.141516
In 1881, Ricketts renamed the lake (formerly known as Long Pond) as Ganoga Lake. Pennsylvania senator Charles R. Buckalew suggested the name Ganoga, an Iroquoian word which he said meant &quot;water on the mountain&quot; in the Seneca language.1718 Ricketts was a lumberman who made his fortune clearcutting nearly all his land, but no logging was allowed within  of the lake,19 and the glens and their waterfalls in the state park were &quot;saved from the lumberman's axe through the foresight of the Ricketts family&quot;.20 One hemlock tree cut near the lake to clear land for a building in 1893 was  in diameter and 532 years old.21
The house and hotel were served by a  branch line of the Lehigh Valley Railroad that ran to the lumber town of Ricketts northeast of the lake. There was daily passenger service to Wilkes-Barre and Towanda, and the line also served freight trains hauling ice from the lake for use in refrigeration from 1895. The wooden addition to the stone house was torn down in 1897, and the land became a garden. The hotel closed in 1903, and passenger train service ended at that time. The sawmills at Ricketts closed when the timber was exhausted in 1913, and the ice company closed in 1915.2223 The stone house remained the Ricketts' summer home. It was renovated and a new wing was added to it in 1913. Ricketts died in 1918 at the stone house; his wife died a few days after and they are buried in the small Ricketts family cemetery near the north end of the lake.2425
 R. B. Ricketts and his wife had three children; their son William Reynolds Ricketts (1869&lt;U+2013&gt;1956) lived in the house after his parents' deaths. Beginning in the 1920s, the Ricketts heirs began selling land to the state of Pennsylvania, but still owned over  surrounding the house, Ganoga Lake, and the glens with their waterfalls. The stone house was included in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) in 1936 as the William R. Ricketts House. The HABS architectural drawings gave its name as &quot;Ganoga&quot;, and William Reynolds Ricketts' history for the HABS refers to it as the stone house.26 The area was approved as a national park site in the 1930s; a 1935 article in The New York Times reported that the federal government planned to purchase  in the area, mentioning the waterfalls and the Ricketts estate and house, which it called &quot;the oldest stone hotel in Pennsylvania&quot;.2728 The National Park Service operated a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at &quot;Ricketts Glynn&quot; (sic),2930 but budget problems and World War II brought an end to national plans for development.3132
In 1942 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began buying the glens and their waterfalls from the heirs for $82,000 and opened Ricketts Glen State Park in 1944.3334 William Reynolds Ricketts died in 1956 and the lake and surrounding land were sold in October 1957 for $109,000. The Department of Forests and Waters (predecessor of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources) bid on the  including the house and lake, but were outbid by a group of private investors. These &quot;formed the Lake Ganoga Association in September 1959 to regulate and preserve the recreation and residential facilities at Lake Ganoga&quot;.35 The association built a road around the lake, cleared some land at its southern end, and its members built about 50 houses on the lake shore. In 1983 the stone house, which now serves as the Ganoga Lake Association's clubhouse, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion.36 The house and lake are not open to the public.37
Architecture
 Clemuel Ricketts, the architect of the stone house, was very interested in architecture from the colonial period and had traveled widely. In the 1840s he published a book which examined the British and European sources of colonial architecture in the United States. Clemuel designed the house in the colonial or Georgian style in 1851; construction began that year and finished the next.3839
The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion lies  west of Ganoga Lake, on a  &quot;clearing completely surrounded by primeval forest&quot;, with a view to the lake.40 The house was originally on the east side of the turnpike, but when what became Pennsylvania Route 487 was built in 1907, the course of the highway was changed so that it now runs east of the lake. Since then, the house is on a private road  from the highway.414243
The original house built in 1852 is L-shaped. According to the architectural drawings made for the HABS, the bottom of the L is  north&lt;U+2013&gt;south by  east&lt;U+2013&gt;west. In 1935 the ground floor of this part of the house included the main door and entrance hall, living room, parlor, library, and stairs. The main entrance is on the west side, which has a porch  wide by  deep, supported by pairs of square pillars with stairs on the north, south, and west sides. The top of the L is  north&lt;U+2013&gt;south by  east&lt;U+2013&gt;west, and in 1935 the ground floor had the dining room, gun room, &quot;brush up room&quot;, toilet, stairs, and a passage to the 1913 addition.44 The inside corner of the L has a two-story covered porch along the south side, and an open terrace on the east side's ground floor. In 1935 the second story of the original house had four bedrooms and a bathroom in the lower part of the L and two bedrooms and a bath in the upper part, as well as two staircases and hallways.4546
 The mansion's stone walls are  thick; the individual building stones are &quot;field sandstone about 17 inches square, of various thicknesses&quot; (17 inches is 43 cm).47 There is a basement below the original house. The lower part of the L is five bays by two bays; the original double-hung sash windows in each bay of the 1852 house have six panes of glass per sash. All the original windows have shutters, these are paneled on the first floor and louvered on the second. The main door is in the Federal style with a large fanlight above the door and sidelights on either side. The attic in the 1852 part of the house is not finished, and the gable roof has &quot;boxed cornices with returns&quot;.4849
In 1897 a formal garden was added north of the stone house, on the site of the razed wooden structure where most of the hotel guests had stayed. In 1913 a two-and-half story wing was added on the north side of the original house, which was renovated; Henry Atherton of Wilkes-Barre was the architect for the addition and restoration work. The new wing is  north&lt;U+2013&gt;south and  east&lt;U+2013&gt;west, with a large enclosed one-story porch on the north and east sides. In 1935 the addition had the kitchen, pantry, storage and refrigeration rooms, and a &quot;maid's dining room&quot; on the first floor,50 two bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor, and two servant rooms and a bath in the finished attic.5152
The new wing has six dormers (three on a side), and six dormers were added to the old house in the renovation (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows on the first floor of the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1852 house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room.5354
The NRHP nomination form lists two other structures on the property: a utility building made of brick and covered in stucco east of the house, and a large barn to the southwest. The house has the original hardware and woodwork and a total of 28 rooms. Since the 1913 renovation, the only changes have been the addition of electrical wiring and modernization of the plumbing. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion &quot;is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture&quot; which &quot;represents the manifestations of one man's architectural dream preserved within the wilderness for over a century&quot;.55
Note
a.  All sources agree that the North Mountain House hotel closed in 1903, but differ on the date that the wooden addition used for the hotel was torn down. William Reynold's Ricketts' history for the HABS and Petrillo's book both report it was razed in 1897,5657 while McDonald's NRHP nomination form gives the year as 1903.58
