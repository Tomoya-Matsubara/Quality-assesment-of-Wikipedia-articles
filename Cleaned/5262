J.M. Frey (pronounced Fry) is a bisexual Canadian science fiction and fantasy author. While she is best known for her debut novel Triptych, Frey's work encompasses poetry, academic and magazine articles, screenplays, and short stories. Frey calls herself a &quot;professional geek.&quot;.1 Frey's fiction work generally follows the conventions of literary fiction mixed with the tropes of science fiction and fantasy, and usually focuses on themes of personal merit, family, queerness, gender, and revisionist literature, as well as genre-deconstruction2 and meta themes.
Her academic work focuses on gender in science fiction, the anthropology of fandom (fanthropology), fanfiction and fanworks (specifically on Mary Sues and Cosplay), as well as the television programs Doctor Who and Stargate: Atlantis.
Frey appears often at Toronto area science fiction conventions, and is involved with charity and community fan groups and initiatives. She also appears on radio shows, television chat shows, and podcasts, discussing fandom and genre works through the lenses of academia or being a female fan.3
Early life
Born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Frey is the first of three children of Donna Frey (n&lt;U+00E9&gt;e Winer) and Danny Frey. She attended Centre Wellington District High School in Fergus, Ontario, and graduated in 2000, then went on to do her Ontario Academic Credits at Orangeville District Secondary School and graduated in 2001.
Frey began writing at the age of eleven. She began by writing fanfiction, which she calls her &quot;apprenticeship to the fandom community&quot;,4 and which led her to write original stories at the age of eighteen. Frey's academic and creative writing focused primarily on Japanese mythology, the Classics, and traditional Japanese theatre.5 She began her first novel while at Brock University, which is as of yet unpublished, and first began to seriously study creative writing there.
After earning her Bachelor of Arts, Dramatic Literature (honors) in 2005, Frey lived in Fukuoka, Japan for two years,6 where she taught English as a Japanese Exchange Teacher, and worked on several other to-date-unpublished manuscripts. In 2007, Frey returned to Canada to attend Ryerson and York Universities for a Masters of Arts.
She made her first professional sale upon returning to Canada, a novella titled &quot;(Back),&quot; which she eventually expanded into the first third of her debut novel &quot;Triptych.&quot;
Dragon Moon Press acquired &quot;Triptych&quot; in late 20097 after Frey and the acquisitions editor Gabrielle Harbowy8 met at a party at the Ad Astra science fiction convention. The book was released April 2011.
Frey completed her Masters of Arts, Communications and Culture (honors) in 2009, where her thesis focused on fanfiction, creative writing and fandom, and the self-insert fiction trope known as a Mary Sue. Other papers Frey presented focused on cosplay, the anthropology and sociology of fandom, and the science fiction television program Doctor Who.
After Triptych's publication, Frey announced that she had signed with the Ethan Ellenberg Literary Agency with Evan J. Gregory.9
Several more short story, essay, and novella sales followed in 2012.10
Personal life
Frey has never been married, and is a self-identified bisexual. Frey currently lives in Toronto, Ontario, where she is very active in the local geek scene.
