Calephelis borealis, commonly known as the Northern Metalmark, is a butterfly of the Riodinidae family. It ranges through western Connecticut south through west-central Pennsylvania; central Appalachians and Ohio River Valley. Isolated populations are also found in southwest Missouri and eastern Oklahoma. The habitat consists of open woodland streams near serpentine, shale or limestone barrens.
The wingspan is 29-32 mm. The wings are brown with wide orange borders and a dark median band. Adults are on wing from mid-June to late July in one generation per year.
The larvae feed on the leaves of Senecio obovatus and possibly Senecio aureus and Erigeron philadelphicus. The species overwinters in the larval stage in leaf litter.1
