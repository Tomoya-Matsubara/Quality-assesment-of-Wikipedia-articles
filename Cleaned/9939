Kanye Omari West (pronounced /'k&lt;U+0251&gt;n.je(&lt;U+026A&gt;)/) (born June 8 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia) is an American record producer and rapper. He has released his debut album The College Dropout, his sophomore album Late Registration, and is working on a third album coming out in 2007 called Graduation. Both The College Dropout and Late Registration have received numerous awards. Kanye West also runs his own record label, GOOD Music.
Biography
Kanye West was born in Atlanta, Georgia, where he lived with both of his parents. When he was three years old his parents divorced, and he and his mother moved to Chicago, Illinois. Kanye's mother, Dr. Donda West, worked as the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as Kanye's manager. Unlike most rappers he came from an upper middle class background.1
After attending The American Academy of Art, a Chicago art school, West attended Columbia College Chicago, but eventually dropped out in order to begin working on his music career. While attending school, West produced for local artists. He later gained fame by producing hit singles for major hip-hop/R&amp;B artists, including Jay-Z, Common, Jadakiss, The Game, Alicia Keys, Foxy Brown, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Cam'Ron, Janet Jackson, Hugh &quot;MC Son&quot; Ryan, Brandy, Eminem, Talib Kweli, Keyshia Cole, Dilated Peoples, Ludacris, Lupe Fiasco, and John Legend. He also &quot;ghost-produced&quot; for his once mentor Deric Angelettie according to his song &quot;Last Call&quot; and the credits of Nas' &quot;Poppa Was a Playa&quot;.
West's style of production often utilizes pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul songs, with his own drums and instruments. The first major label song he produced featuring vocal samples was &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;, a track from Jay-Z's &quot;Dynasty: Roc La Familia&quot;. Kanye admitted that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style21, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface and Ol' Dirty Bastard were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: &quot;Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time... We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.&quot;2
He has also admitted that he sped up the drum beat of Dr. Dre's &quot;Xxplosive&quot; to use as a replacement for his original drums on &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;.3
2001
Kanye's sound was featured heavily on Jay-Z's critically-acclaimed album The Blueprint, released on September 11 2001. His work was featured on the lead single &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&quot; and the diss record against Nas &amp; Mobb Deep named &quot;Takeover.&quot; Oddly, West has worked with Mobb Deep and Nas since the track's release. Regardless, West soon became a major name in hip hop production following the release of the album, but struggled to find a way to get a record deal. Jay-Z admitted that Roc-A-Fella was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that he saw him as a producer first and foremost. Multiple record companies pushed him aside because he was not the stereotypical hip hop artist. Companies felt he was not as marketable as rappers that portray the &quot;street image&quot; that is prominent in hip hop culture.
2002â€“2004
On October 23, 2002, Kanye was involved in a car crash after falling asleep at the wheel while driving home from the recording studio. The crash left his jaw fractured in three places, and he barely survived. Although faced with many adversities and therapy, Kanye was inspired by life itself and what it now had to offer. The crash also provided inspiration for West's first single, &quot;Through the Wire&quot;. Following his recovery, Kanye became a born again Christian, crediting Jesus for his quick recovery. West's faith is apparent in many of his songs, such as &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, which became a staple at his benefit performances, such as the Live 8 concert. These songs were featured on West's debut album, The College Dropout, which was released on Roc-A-Fella Records in February 2004, and went on to receive critical acclaim. The album also defined the style for which West would become known, including wordplay and sampling.
Kanye was involved in a financial dispute over Royce da 5'9&quot;'s song &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, produced by West and released on Build &amp; Destroy: The Lost Sessions. Kanye maintains that Royce never paid for the beat, but recorded to it and released it; hearing him on the beat, the original customers decided not to buy it from West. After the disagreement, West vowed to never work with Royce again.4
2005
On August 30, 2005, Kanye West released his second album Late Registration. Reviews were mostly favorable: &quot;Late Registration is an undeniable triumph&quot; (Rolling Stone), &quot;As ornate and bloated as West's ego&quot;. (Spin September 2005, p.99). With the help of producer samples in different ways along with compositions of strings and other sounds. The record earned the number one spot on the Village Voice's Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll of 2005.5 The first two singles from Late Registration were &quot;Diamonds from Sierra Leone&quot; (which features vocals from Shirley Bassey's &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;) and &quot;Gold Digger&quot; featuring Jamie Foxx (which contains an interpolation of Ray Charles's &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;) to sell over 904,000 copies in its first week, and earned him eight Grammy Award nominations including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for the song &quot;Gold Digger&quot;.
In September 2005, West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006.6 Even months after its speculated release, the current status of this project is unknown.
2006
In January 2006, West again sparked controversy when he appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone in the image of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns. Later that month, he suggested in Playboy that if a bible were written in the present day, he is famous and important enough to be included in it. &quot;I throw up historical subjects in a way that makes kids want to learn about them&quot;, West claimed. &quot;[I'm] definitely in the history books already.&quot;
In February 2006, Kanye performed live at the 2006 BRIT Awards in London, England. He performed GoldDigger with hundreds of professional female dancers, all of them dressed head-to-toe in gold outfits. Four of these were the UK Pop Rock band RockerBaby.
After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released West said he would &quot;really have a problem&quot; if he didn't win the Album of the Year award because of the comments, saying &quot;I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt &lt;U+2014&gt; you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it. I don't want to hear all of that politically correct stuff&quot;. 3. West won several Grammy awards, including Best Rap Album, but did not win the Album of the Year Award. The award instead went to U2's How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Ironically, in November 2006, West was the opening act for U2 during the 5th leg of their Vertigo Tour in Australia and New Zealand.
On August 5, 2006 Kanye headlined the second day of the Lollapalooza music festival in his hometown of Chicago. Later that month, People magazine reported that Kanye became engaged to his girlfriend Alexis while spending two weeks overseas with her.7
On November 2, 2006, when &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; failed to win Best Video at the MTV Europe Music Awards, West went onto the stage as the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for &quot;We Are Your Friends&quot; and argued that he should have won the award instead.8 Hundreds of news outlets worldwide criticized the outburst.9 On November 7, 2006 Kanye apologized for this outburst. He did this publicly during his performance as support act for U2 for their Vertigo concert in Brisbane, Australia.
In December 2006, Robert &quot;Evel&quot; Knievel sued Kanye West for trademark infringement in West's video for &quot;Touch the Sky&quot;. Knievel is taking issue with a &quot;sexually-charged video&quot; in which West takes on the persona of &quot;Evel Kanyevel&quot; and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit filed in federal court claims infringement on his trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claims the &quot;vulgar and offensive&quot; images depicted in the video damage his reputation. The suit seeks damages and to stop distribution of the video.10
This year he was also rumored to be working on Michael Jackson's next album, scheduled for late 2007, along with his cousin Devo Springsteen and John Legend.
2007
In 2007, it was announced that West would be starring in a series directed by Larry Charles. He has been working on the pilot episode for the past two years with Larry Charles and Rick Rubin. He also had this to say on January 14, 2007: &quot;I wouldn&lt;U+2019&gt;t do something as clich&lt;U+00E9&gt; as a reality show. At least give me the credit for being more creative than that. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s a situational half-hour comedy. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s fictional, and loosely based on my life.&quot;11 West recently collaborated with Japanese hip hop group Teriyaki Boyz to produce the single &quot;I Still Love H.E.R.&quot;, a reference to Common's 1994 single &quot;I Used to Love H.E.R.&quot;. It is rumored that West's introductory lines preceding his verse are a thinly-veiled jab at producer/rapper Danny!, who was mercilessly compared to West in the beginning of his career.
Kanye is also working on his new artist Jazz Cartier' ,Jazz Cartier's album, Cool, Calm &amp; Cartier', is set to be released in December. Jazz Cartier' is signed under Def Jam/G.O.O.D Music.
Kanye was slated to appear on Timbaland's solo LP Timbaland Presents Shock Values on a track with Missy Elliott but didn't make the cut.
In the middle of February, Kanye released a remix of Fall Out Boy's new #1 hit song &quot;This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race&quot; from their newly released album Infinity On High. In the remix he congratulates FOB for their recently huge success and their #1 hit also adding that he wants the #1 spot also (&quot;The Arms Race made them raise their arms and race straight to the top, who knew? Right now they've got the #1 spot, do ya want that&lt;U+2026&gt; me too&quot;). It is also rumored that Fall Out Boy will be releasing a remix of one of West's songs off his new album later this year.
Further to this, during a radio appearance in early 2007, West, like many of his peers, recorded an impromptu freestyle to the popular song &quot;Throw Some D's&quot;. West's version became extremely popular because of the different stance he took. The song that to all other rappers was about automobile rims, was used by West to comically refer to D-cup breasts. Because of the unexpected success of the song, West went on to make a video for the freestyle, in which he is seen playing his 'Old Ass Cousin'. The video for the remix can be seen here.
Kanye was also featured in a new song called &quot;Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)&quot;. It was believed to be a single from his upcoming album, Graduation, because of him being the main rapper, but Nike quickly explained that it was for the Nike Air Force One's anniversary. It was meant only to be an exclusive track.
Management/production firm Hip-Hop Since 1978 entered into an exclusive partnership with Bryant Management to represent rapper Lil&lt;U+2019&gt; Wayne. Gee Roberson and Kyambo &quot;Hip-Hop&quot; Joshua of Hip-Hop Since 1978 will work together with Lil&lt;U+2019&gt; Wayne&lt;U+2019&gt;s long-time manager Cortez Bryant as they take on all facets of Lil&lt;U+2019&gt; Wayne&lt;U+2019&gt;s career including music, television, and film. Roberson and Joshua also manage superstar rapper Kanye West, who will lend his production talent to Lil' Wayne's upcoming release &quot;Tha Carter 3&quot;.
On March 25, Kanye and his father Ray West supported World Water Day by having a &quot;Walk for Water&quot; rally.12
After a two-year break, Kanye has returned back to being a fashion columnist on lifestyle magazine Complex. 13
On the MTV music section of news, its was confirmed that West will release his long-awaited album Graduation. Def Jam has confirmed that its savant's next opus is slated for September but says the 18th isn't concrete as of yet. Although West did not give away the titles for the songs he has ready to go, he did say some of the rumors circulating around the Internet about them are true. If that's the case, we can look forward to a record called &quot;Homecoming&quot; featuring Chris Martin of Coldplay and a ditty titled &quot;The Glory,&quot; which was originally conceived for Common's upcoming Finding Forever LP14. Kanye's first single is &quot;Can't Tell Me Nothing&quot;, which leaked. This single also leaked on Kanye's mixtape Can't Tell Me Nothing which dropped on May 29, 2007 on Datpiff, an Internet mixtape download site. This mixtape uses beats from Radiohead, makes references to the Virginia Tech massacre, and has performances from Common, Lupe Fiasco, and Pharrell just to name a few. 15
On May 30, the album's release date was pushed up to late August 2007.16
Political views
On July 2 2005, West appeared on the Philadelphia bill of Live 8, using the global platform to refer to &quot;man-made diseases placed in African communities&quot;, a reference to the OPV AIDS hypothesis.17
In the song &quot;Crack Music&quot;, he raps, &quot;How [did] we stop the Black Panthers?/Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer&quot;, a reference to the allegation that the Reagan administration intentionally placed crack cocaine in the ghettos of the United States. In the second verse, he raps, &quot;Who gave Saddam anthrax?/George Bush got the answer&quot;, a reference to the allegation that he sold chemical weapons to Iraq in the 1980s and 1990s.
In the song &quot;Roses&quot;, West raps about his belief that the government controls the spread of AIDS by rapping &quot;If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS / And all the broke mothafuckas passed away / You telling me if my grandma was in the NBA / Right now she would be okay?&quot;. This is also a reference to Magic Johnson's unlikely recovery and highly publicized battle with the virus.
Demonstrating his views against George W. Bush, in a 2006 live orchestral performance of &quot;All Falls Down&quot; (later released on the &quot;Late Orchestration&quot; mixtape) West replaced &quot;the White man gets paid off of all of that&quot; with &quot;George Bush gets paid off of all of that&quot;.
On August 22, 2005, the MTV special All Eyes On Kanye West aired, in which West spoke out against homophobia in hip-hop, claiming that hip-hop has always been about &quot;speaking your mind and about breaking down barriers, but everyone in hip-hop discriminates against gay people&quot;. He then reflected on a personal experience. He said that he had a &quot;turning point&quot; when he realized one of his cousins was gay. He said regarding this experience: &quot;This is my cousin. I love him and I've been discriminating against gays.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;not just hip-hop, but America just discriminates against gay people ... I wanna just come on TV, and just tell my rappers, just tell my friends, 'Yo, stop it'&quot;. He also drew comparison between African Americans' struggle for civil rights and today's gay rights movement.18
The following year, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, West further expounded his experiences with and views on the relationship between the black and gay communities:
Hurricane Katrina fundraiser controversy
 On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina relief on NBC, A Concert for Hurricane Relief, West was a featured speaker. Controversy arose when West was presenting, as he deviated from the prepared script:4
I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it [the media] says, 'they're looting'. You see a white family, it says, 'they're looking for food'. And, you know, it's been five days [waiting for federal help] because most of the people are black. And even for me to complain about it, I would be a hypocrite because I've tried to turn away from the teacher, the TV, because it's too hard to watch. I've even been shopping before even giving a donation, so now I'm calling my business manager right now to see what's, what is the biggest amount I can give, and just to imagine if I was, if I was down there, and those are, those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help &lt;U+2014&gt; with the set up, the way America is set up to help, the uh, uh, the poor, the black people, the, uh, the less well-off, as slow as possible. I mean, this is, the Red Cross is doing everything they can. We already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now, fighting another way &lt;U+2014&gt; and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!
Mike Myers, with whom West was paired to present, spoke next and continued as normal by reading the script, though with obvious discomfort. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he delivered the controversial phrase:
George Bush doesn't care about black people.
Although the camera quickly cut away to Chris Tucker, West's comments still reached all of the United States.
Kanye West and Mike Myers met again on a brief sketch on Saturday Night Live, in which Myers joked that since the telethon, the government has stripped him of his American citizenship (&quot;still got my Canadian citizenship to fall back on&quot;, Myers joked), and placed him under heavy government surveillance.

Trivia
In his home, West paid for a painting on his ceiling similar to Michelangelo's painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. &quot;It will hang on the ceiling in my dining room. It's gonna have over 50 cherubs and saints.&quot; said West.19
Late Registration sold over 904,000 copies in its first week.
West's statement &quot;George Bush doesn't care about black people&quot; was satirized on Arrested Development. GOB's puppet Franklin Delano Bluth wore a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;George Bush doesn't care about black puppets&quot; in one of the series' final episodes.
The same statement was also satirized on the South Park episode Two Days Before The Day After Tomorrow, as &quot;George Bush doesn't care about beavers!&quot;.
Kanye West is parodied in the film Epic Movie for the controversial statement as well, although it is the parodied Diddy who says it and it was about the &quot;Evil White Bitch&quot;.
West started his career producing songs by proxy, most notably for Bad Boy producer Deric &quot;D-Dot&quot; Angelettie.
He appeared in Cassidy's &quot;Get No Better&quot; music video.
West has reportedly made several unsuccessful romantic advances to Sugababes singer Amelle Berrabah on numerous occasions. On the most recent occasion, he allegedly ordered his 29-year-old assistant to &quot;issue Amelle with a furious telling off&quot;.20
Kanye was originally supposed to be on R. Kelly's newest album, Double Up, on a track called &quot;Hook It Up.&quot; But his part was given to another rapper, Huey.
