She is known for her appearances in Stuff, Maxim, Time, Penthouse, her role as host of the Fuse TV show Pants-Off Dance-Off and her position as the most popular artist on MySpace (according to page views) as of April 2006 and self-given title of &quot;Miss Myspace&quot;.2 She was raised in Houston, Texas. Her MTV reality show A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila premiered on October 9, 2007.
Early life
Tila was born in Singapore, where her family immigrated from Vietnam after the Vietnam War.34 When Tila was a year old, she and her family moved to Alief, a suburb of Houston, where they lived, until they were admitted to a gated community run by a strict Buddhist temple.5 The family left the community when Nguyen was eight.6
While in middle school, Nguyen became a tomboy and was eventually sent to a boarding school for six months for her combative behavior before transferring to another school.7 While in high school, she used her sister's identification card to enter nightclubs, where she began recreational drug use8 and joined a gang. In an interview with Import Tuner, Nguyen said she had been searching for a sense of identity: &quot;I was really confused then, [because] at first I thought I was black, then I thought I was Hispanic and joined a cholo gang&quot;.9 Later, friends outside the gang briefly helped turn her life around. However her past caught up with her, and she fled to Queens, New York at the age of 16.10
Career
Modeling and acting
Tila's career began at the age of 18 when she was discovered at the Sharpstown Mall by a Playboy scout and was offered a chance to model nude for the magazine. She did a test shoot,11 then eventually moved to Southern California and was featured as Playboy&lt;U+2019&gt;s Cyber Girl of the week on April 22, 2002, and soon thereafter she became the first Asian Cyber Girl of the Month.12 A few more pictorials for the magazine followed.13
Tila gained further popularity through the import racing scene. She has been featured on the cover of Import Tuner magazine, at car shows such as Hot Import Nights, and in the video game Street Racing Syndicate.1415 In 2003, she was a contestant on VH1's Surviving Nugent, a reality TV show where participants performed compromising tasks and stunts for rock star Ted Nugent.16 She was also the most frequent host on the first season of Fuse TV's dance show, Pants-Off Dance-Off, on which a group of contestants strip to music videos.17
Nguyen was featured on the cover of the April 2006 issue of Stuff magazine; in the interview, she claimed that her nickname &quot;Tila Tequila&quot; came about when she experimented with alcohol in middle school and had a severe allergic reaction.18 She was later included in Stuff&lt;U+2019&gt;s 100 Sexiest Women Online. She appeared on the August 2006 Maxim UK cover, was named #88 in their Hot 100 List,19 and also appeared in the December 2007 issue.20She was ranked #100 on the Maxim Hot 100 list in 2008.
Tequila made an appearance as one of the 12 strangers in the first game on the April 6, 2007 episode of NBC's game show Identity. Her identity was that she has &quot;over one million MySpace friends,&quot;.  On March 4, 2007 she made a cameo appearance on the show &quot;War At Home.&quot;21 She also appeared as a Hooters Girl in the 2007 film I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.
A Shot at Love
On March 26, 2007, Tequila announced in her MySpace blog that she would be filming a reality show for VH1.22 Filming started in May 2007, but the show was moved to VH1's sister network MTV that summer. On October 9, 2007, A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila aired on MTV. The program is a bisexual-themed reality dating show where sixteen straight men and sixteen lesbian women compete for Tequila's affections, the twist being that the contestants were not aware of her bisexuality23 until the end of the first episode. The ten-episode series is produced by 495 Productions and MTV.24
The show was at the heart of a heated online debate between Tequila and conservative Christians after an article appeared on The Christian Post on September 13, 2007.25 After seeing the article, Tequila wrote an impassioned response in her blog on September 28, 2007, criticizing churches for &quot;bashing&quot; the gay community while thanking God for saving her life.2627
The show premiered for a second season in April 2008 and became a popular gossip subject in Asian media, such as AsianWeek.28The season finale premiered July 8, 2008, the winner being Kristy Morgan who declined her &quot;shot at love&quot;. It has been revealed that there will be a new season of the series. However, a different bisexual woman will be its bachelorette.29 Tequila had previously confirmed on her official website that she would not be a part of the show's third season, but will instead be featured in a show focusing on her daily life.
Online business ventures
In July 2001 Nguyen started up her website entitled &quot;Tila's Hot Spot&quot;.30 Originally it was a website featuring her information, quotes, blog, and pictorials31 including content that required adult verification and a monthly payment fee to view.32 Later the site format was revamped by TAJ Designs Inc. to feature all-ages content and information to promote her current career, business ventures, personal information, and a premium membership section including videos, non-nude picture galleries, blogs, and chat sessions.33. In 2008, Buzznet partnered with Tequila to transfer the site and transform it into a social network.34
During 2005 Nguyen launched Tilafashion.com,35 a site featuring her custom line of clothing for men and women originally using the slogan &quot;So hot you'll just want to take it all off!&quot;36 In 2006 Tila created a website entitled &quot;Tila Zone,&quot;37 which features content to use on Myspace and other social networking websites including layouts, widgets, and clipart.38
Music career
Tila used modeling as a stepping stone for other ventures. At age 20, she acted on her interest in rock music and started looking for bands willing to have her join. She eventually assembled a band called Beyond Betty Jean, for which she was singer and songwriter. Following the breakup of Beyond Betty Jean, Tila started working in recording studios to sharpen her vocal skills and wrote music.39 Tila Tequila became the lead singer of a band called Jealousy, which has released songs over the Internet. Jealousy has appeared on MySpace Records' inaugural compilation album, released through MySpace Records and Interscope.
A major turn in Tequila's music career occurred during the April 24, 2006 taping of MTV's Total Request Live. In an interview with the TRL VJs, will.i.am announced that Tequila was signed to the Will.I.Am music group, a record label under A&amp;M Records. Despite her major-label signing, Tequila independently released her first single &quot;I Love U&quot; through iTunes on February 27, 2007, justifying the independent release through her desire to become famous by herself.40 She shot a music video for the song, which is available for free after the song is downloaded. A preview for the video debuted on February 14, 2007 on her MySpace page. The video was also released via mobile phones.
In March 2007, Washington-based record label The Saturday Team released an EP called Sex, by Tila Tequila.41 On July 27, 2007, Italian website MusicBlob reported that The Saturday Team and distributor Icon Music Entertainment Services sued Nguyen over breaching her contract related to the album.42 However, Tila, through a MySpace bulletin,43, claimed the EP was not authorized for release by her, and was removed from most retailers.
On October 9, 2007, the same day her reality show A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila premiered, Tila released her second official single, &quot;Stripper Friends&quot;44. In mid-November Tila shot the video for her third single &quot;Paralyze&quot;. The video was shot at an upscale Los Angeles condo. Scenes were shot featuring Tila with a long dark brown wig on (at the time, she had a short blond bob) as well as without the wig. However, the scenes were originally cut from the video.
She shot the music video for &quot;Stripper Friends&quot; in early December 2007 at a Los Angeles strip club. The video premiered via Yahoo! Music on February 26, 2008 and was released to iTunes on March 4, 2008. The single failed to chart. On April 2, 2008 the music video for &quot;Paralyze&quot; was released, again via Yahoo! Music and the single was released to iTunes on April 8, 2008.45
In July 2008 the song &quot;Hideaway&quot; was released through Tila's MySpace and received good response from fans. The song was taken down later that same day, although Tila did announce46 that she would be releasing her first full-length debut album in the winter. She also stated that because of the fan response, the new song &quot;Hideaway&quot; would appear on the album.
On August 7, 2008, Tila stated in a blog that she has been &quot;in the studio 24/7 cooking up a writing dance storm for [her] new album&quot; and that the album would be titled Tila Tequila: I Have Tourettes. 47 
Hooking Up with Tila Tequila
On December 2, 2008, Tila released a self-help book, Hooking Up with Tila Tequila: A Guide to Love, Fame, Happiness, Success, and Being the Life of the Party (ISBN 9781439101537). She herself has said of the book, &quot;After all these years, there are so many fan questions, and I always have given little spurts of advice, but I always sensed that everyone wanted more. I can't just write a blog on it, because it would be the size of a book... So I decided, 'Why don't I put it all together?' That way they can keep it as memorabilia and go back to it whenever they need help and hopefully inspire them.&quot;4849
