24 is an American television series produced for the Fox Network and syndicated worldwide, starring Kiefer Sutherland as Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) agent Jack Bauer. Each 24-episode season covers 24 hours in the life of Bauer, using the real time method of narration. Premiering on November 6, 2001, the show spanned 192 episodes over eight seasons, with the series finale broadcast on May 24, 2010. In addition, the television movie 24: Redemption was broadcast between seasons six and seven, while a feature film of the same name is also planned.
Bauer is the only character to have appeared in every episode of the series. The series begins with his working for the Los Angeles-based Counter Terrorist Unit, in which he is a highly-proficient agent with an &quot;ends justify the means&quot; approach, regardless of the perceived morality of some of his actions.12 Throughout the series most of the main plot elements unfold like a political thriller.3 A typical plot has Jack Bauer's racing against the clock as he attempts to thwart multiple terrorist plots, including presidential assassination attempts, nuclear, biological and chemical threats, cyber attacks, as well as conspiracies which deal with government and corporate corruption.
The series has been criticized for its depictions of torture as effective and necessary by human rights activists, military officials,4 and experts in questioning and interrogation,5 with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series.
The show won numerous awards over its eight seasons, including Best Drama Series at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards and Outstanding Drama Series at the 2006 Primetime Emmy Awards. At the conclusion of its eighth and final season, 24 became the longest-running espionage-themed television drama ever, surpassing both Mission: Impossible and The Avengers.6
Synopsis
Premise
24 is a serial drama which stars Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer, focusing on the efforts of the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit, and their efforts to protect America from terrorism plots. Each episode typically follows Bauer, officials in the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind the events of the day, often simultaneously. The episodes takes place over the course of one hour, depicting events as they happen, in real time.7 To emphasize the real-world flow of events, a clock is prominently displayed on-screen during the show, and there is a regular use of a split screens, a technique used to depict multiple scenes occurring at the same time.
Overview
Season one begins at 12:00 am on the day of the California presidential primary in Los Angeles. Jack Bauer's protocol is to protect Senator David Palmer from an assassination plot, and rescue his own family from those responsible for the plot, who seek retribution for Jack's and David Palmer's involvement with a covert U.S. mission in the Balkans.
Season two is set 18 months after the events of the first season, and begins at 8:00 am. Jack must stop a nuclear bomb from detonating in Los Angeles, then assist President David Palmer in proving who is responsible for the threat. This is necessary to avoid an unfounded war between the United States and three Middle Eastern countries.
Season three, set three years after the end of the second season's events, begins at 1:00 pm. While struggling with a heroin addiction he gained while undercover with a Mexican drug cartel, Jack must re-infiltrate the group in order to acquire a deadly virus being marketed underground. Meanwhile, President David Palmer is preparing for a live presidential debate in the run-up to elections. Later, Jack and Palmer must cooperate with terrorist Stephen Saunders, who eventually gains possession of the virus, and stop him from releasing it in several American cities.
Season four, set 18 months later, begins at 7:00 am. Jack must save the lives of his new boss Secretary of Defense James Heller and Heller's daughter Audrey Raines (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when his boss and daughter are kidnapped by terrorists. The same terrorists then launch further attacks against America, and Jack is forced to use unorthodox methods to stop them, with long-term consequences for both Jack and the United States.
Season five, set 18 months after, begins at 7:00 am. Jack is believed to be dead by everyone except a few of his closest friends. He is forced to resurface when some of those friends are murdered and he is framed. Terrorists with connections to the U.S. government attempt to steal nerve gas in order to protect U.S. oil interests in Asia, and Jack discovers an insidious conspiracy while trying to stop them.
Season six, set 20 months later, begins at 6:00 am. Jack is released after being detained in a Chinese prison following the events of season five. Terrorists plot to set off suitcase nuclear devices in the United States and Jack must stop them. Later, Jack has to choose between his loved ones and national security when the Chinese set their sights on sensitive circuitry that could trigger a war between the U.S. and Russia.
Due to the 2007&lt;U+2013&gt;2008 Writers' Strike, season seven was delayed one year.8 To bridge the one-and-a-half-year gap between seasons, Redemption was produced. It was a television movie that aired on November 23, 2008. Set three and a half years after season six, Jack finds himself caught up in a military coup in the fictional African nation of Sangala. Meanwhile, in the United States, it is Inauguration Day, where Allison Taylor is being sworn into office as president.
Season seven, set 65 days after the end of Redemption, begins at 8:00 am. Jack is assisted by the FBI and old colleagues when the firewall responsible for protecting America's government computer infrastructure is breached by the same people responsible for a conflict in Sangala. Jack must then secure evidence to begin their arrests, some of whom are within President Taylor's administration, but not before an attack on the White House ensues. Later, a private military contractor attempts to release biological weapons on U.S. soil, while their superiors are working with one of Jack's old colleagues, Tony Almeida.
Season eight, set 18 months later,9 begins at 4:00 pm. Jack is about to leave for Los Angeles with his daughter Kim, her husband Stephen and daughter Teri, when Bauer is brought in by CTU to uncover a Russian plot to assassinate Islamic leader Omar Hassan during peace negotiations with U.S. President Taylor. Russia fears such peace negotiations will threaten their power. This leads to Islamic extremists creating a dirty bomb, which they threaten to detonate unless Hassan is handed over. Later, Jack must seek retribution for lives lost amidst a governmental cover-up initiated by former president Charles Logan and approved by Taylor. In the end Jack is faced with both foreign and American governments hunting him down as they seek revenge for his actions against them.
Production
Conception
The idea for the series first came from executive producer Joel Surnow, who initially had the idea of a TV show with 24 episodes in a season. Each episode would be an hour long, taking place over the course of a single day.10 He discussed the idea over the phone with producer Robert Cochran, whose initial response was &quot;Forget it, that's the worst idea I've ever heard, it will never work and it's too hard&quot;.11 They met the next day at the International House of Pancakes in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, to discuss the idea of this action-espionage series that used the format of real time to create dramatic tension with a race against the clock.12
The pilot for 24 was pitched to Fox who immediately bought it, saying they felt that the idea for the series was one that would &quot;move the form of television forward&quot;.13 The episode had a $4 million budget with filming in March 2001, mostly done in an old Chatsworth pencil factory. The set of CTU was initially done in a Fox Sports office, with the set reproduced once the series was picked up for the season.1415 The series was supposed to be filmed in Toronto, but due to the variability of Canadian weather, Los Angeles was chosen as a filming location.16
The pilot of the series had been well received by critics, and was signed on for an initial thirteen episodes. Production began in July 2001, and the premiere was planned for October 30, but because of the September 11 attacks, delayed until November 6.171819 After the first three episodes, Fox greenlit the remaining filmed 11 episodes and following Kiefer Sutherland's Golden Globe win, Fox ordered the second half of the season.20
Design
Split screens
 The idea of split screens was born out of the the amount of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace parallel adventures of different characters, and aid in connecting them. the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element in the series.21
Running clock
The idea of the running clock initially came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the shows fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock which appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller, silent clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story.22 When the running clock is shown, an alternating beeping noise for each second can usually be heard. This ticking is absent on rare occasions in the series, such as following the death of a major character or after a disastrous event.23
Real time
The concept of real time started when producer Joel Surnow thought of the idea of doing 24 episodes in a season, which each episode lasting an hour. They decided that the idea of real time had to make the show a &quot;race against the clock&quot;.24 Each episode takes place over the course of one hour, with time continuing to elapse during the commercial breaks. The exact amount of time is denoted by the digital clock display at the beginning and end of each segment. Mundane events, such as travel, sometimes occur during commercial breaks and thus these events are largely unseen.25 The story time correlates with elapsed viewing time if episodes are broadcast with commercial breaks of set duration inserted at the points prescribed by the episode.26
In line with the depiction of events in real time, 24 does not use slow motion techniques. The series also does not use flashbacks, except once during the first season finale. Watched continuously without advertisements, each season would run approximately 17 hours. Jack Back&quot; /&gt;
Setting
The first six seasons of the show were mostly based in Los Angeles and nearby California locations&lt;U+2014&gt;both real and fictional.27 Other locations have also been featured, such as Washington, D.C., for parts of the fourth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The eighth season took place in New York City,28 and the TV movie Redemption, filmed in South Africa, was set mainly in the fictional African nation of Sangala.29
The main setting of the show is the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit. Its office consists of two main departments: Field Operations, which involves confronting and apprehending suspects, and Communications, which gathers intelligence and assists those that work in Field Operations. CTU offices are established in various cities with these units reporting to &quot;Divisions&quot;, and Divisions reporting to the &quot;District&quot;. While CTU itself is a fictional agency, several entities with similar names or duties, like the National Counterterrorism Center, have emerged since the show's debut on television.30
The set of CTU was initially filmed in a Fox Sports office, with the set recreated in old pencil factory in Chatsworth. The same set was used for the first three seasons, but was redesigned before the start of the fourth season, and again before the start of the eight season. Other sets were also constructed here, such as Charles Logan's presidential retreat shown in seasons five and six, and the White House bunker shown in season six.31
Series conclusion
On March 26, 2010, a statement was issued from Fox which explained that season eight would conclude 24s run on television. Kiefer Sutherland gave a statement:
Executive producer and showrunner Howard Gordon was also a part of the decision. He was quoted saying:
Peter Rice, Chairman of Entertainment at Fox Networks Group said, &quot;24 is so much more than just a TV show &lt;U+2013&gt; it has redefined the drama genre and created one of the most admired action icons in television history.&quot; Kevin Reilly, President of Entertainment at Fox Broadcasting Company added, &quot;We are extremely proud of this groundbreaking series and will be forever thankful to Kiefer, the producers, the cast and crew for everything they&lt;U+2019&gt;ve put into 24 over the years. It&lt;U+2019&gt;s truly been an amazing and unforgettable eight days.32
The final episode aired on May 24, 2010.3334
Relation to other productions
Immediately prior to 24, series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran executive-produced La Femme Nikita for its entire five-year run on USA Network. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, and the lead characters of both series are placed in situations where they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and off-screen creative connections between 24 and La Femme Nikita. Several actors from La Femme Nikita have portrayed similar roles on 24, a number of story concepts from La Femme Nikita have been revisited on 24, and many of the creative personnel from La Femme Nikita worked on 24 in their same role.353637
Similar to the 1997 film, Air Force One, 24 featured the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One). Air Force One was featured in 24 seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, J&lt;U+00FC&gt;rgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air Force One.38 The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air Force One set from another television series, The West Wing.39
Feature film
A feature film adaptation of 24 was originally planned for the hiatus between the sixth and seventh seasons. Series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran were set to write the script with showrunner Howard Gordon working on story.40 Filming was going to take place in London, Prague, and Morocco.41 Plans for the movie were later put on hold. Kiefer Sutherland explained, &quot;It's impossible to ask writers to work on the show and then come up with an amazing film we can shoot in the break between seasons.&quot;42
It was later decided that the film would begin after the conclusion of the eighth and final season. It was to take be set and shot on-location in Europe. Joel Surnow, Robert Cochran, Howard Gordon, and Kiefer Sutherland were going to be executive producers on the film, and Billy Ray was going to write the screenplay.43 Shooting was planned to start in late 2010 or early 2011.44
In April 2010, Kiefer Sutherland said in an interview at a BAFTA event in London that the script was finished and he would be reading it upon his return to the United States. He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame.45 Sutherland described the film production as &quot;exciting&quot; because, &quot;It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so we were not going to be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show.&quot;46 In November 2010, executive producer Howard Gordon revealed that a &quot;work in progress&quot; screenplay was being read by Fox, but that the movie did not yet have a green light or fixed schedule.47 In December 2010, Howard Gordon revealed that Fox turned down the script by Billy Ray, saying, &quot;It wasn't strong enough or compelling enough&quot;. Gordon is currently no longer involved with the project, but states that director Tony Scott has an idea and will pitch it to Sutherland.48 Executive producer Brian Grazer tweeted in April 2011 that the film is planned for a 2012 release.4950

Impact and reception
Reaction
The series attracted significant criticism for its depictions of torture. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous,525354 led to concerns that junior U.S. soldiers would imitate or had imitated techniques shown on the series.555657 In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly as a result of these discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops,585960 there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series.6162
The issue of torture on the series was discussed by President Bill Clinton who stated that while he does not feel there is a place in U.S. policy for torture, but &quot;If you're the Jack Bauer person, you'll do whatever you do and you should be prepared to take the consequences.&quot;63 Supreme Court Justice Anton Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no jury would convict Bauer in those types of situations.64
In Germany and Switzerland, 24 was criticized for the various techniques employed by Bauer in apprehending terrorists.6566

It was the number one DVD there, knocking off Lord of the Rings, which is unheard of for a television show DVD to actually knock-out every feature DVD available. And that's because they showed it without commercials.&quot;98 The U.S. sales of the season one DVDs increased the audience size of season two by 25%.99
A special edition of the first season was released on May 20, 2008. The new set includes a seventh disc of bonus features, while discs 1&lt;U+2013&gt;6 contain all 24 episodes with deleted scenes, audio commentaries, and 5 extended episodes. The set was packaged in a steel box.100
The television movie 24: Redemption was released on DVD in Region 1 on November 25, 2008, and in Region 2 on December 1, 2008. The DVD contains the broadcast version as well as an extended version with optional audio commentary, a making-of featurette, child soldiers in Africa featurette, a season 6 recap, and the first 17 minutes of the season 7 premiere episode.
The seventh season was the first season to be released on Blu-ray format.101 The eighth season was also released on Blu-ray. A complete series set was released on DVD along with the release of season eight.102
