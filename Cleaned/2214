History
Hotel Moskva
The inn &quot;Velika Srbija&quot; was previously located on the lot where hotel is today. Hotel Moskva itself was built in 1906 and open on January 16, 1908. The importance it had even at that time can bee seen as it was personally open by the King of Serbia, Peter I Kara&lt;U+0111&gt;or&lt;U+0111&gt;evi&lt;U+0107&gt;. 1 Hotel was built with the Russian capital, hence the name. Soon after it was opened, Olympic Committee of Serbia and Club of the journalists and writers moved in. In 1923 Postal Savings Bank took over the hotel, which in turn was taken over by the National Bank of Yugoslavia in 1938. During World War II, Gestapo moved into the hotel in 1941, transforming it into its headquarters, and renamed it to Velika Srbija, after the original inn. The headquarter had its own power generators and water sources and was one of the last buildings liberated at the end of war. During German withdrawal in 1944, original master's paintings, silverware and gold-plated utensils which were in the hotel were looted and taken away. In the post war period, it became a favorite place of the cultural elite. Yugoslav Nobel laureate in literature, Ivo Andri&lt;U+0107&gt;, had his own table at the restaurant, and poet Vasko Popa was a regular visitor.
Architecture
Hotel was designed by the architect Jovan Ilki&lt;U+0107&gt;, in Secessionist style, quite daring for that time, giving Belgrade a modern face during the transformation it was undergoing at the turn of the century. The most impressive feature, even at the first glance, is the smooth and shiny fa&lt;U+00E7&gt;ade, made of ceramic tiles. Originally, it had 36 rooms, but after many renovations, today it has 132 rooms (of those 40 duplex rooms) and 6 apartments.
