The 90th Light Infantry Division was a German Army division during World War II that served in north Africa as well as Sardinia and Italy. The division played a major role in most of the actions against the Allied 8th Army in the western desert and eventually surrendered to the Allies in Tunisia in 1943. It was re-constituted later in 1943 and deployed to Sardinia and when the expected Allied invasion of Sardinia failed to materialise, the division was moved to Italy. It was engaged in actions against the Allies in Italy from 1943 to September 1944 when the division was listed as &quot;destroyed&quot; south of Bologna.
History
Formation
The 90th Light Infantry Division was initially created in August 1941 as Division z.b.V. Afrika, from units already in Africa under the control ofDivisions-Kommando z.b.V. Afrika. The abbreviation z.b.V. stands for zur besonderen Verwendung, which translates as &quot;for a special use&quot; in English. One of the first French units to be subjected to German pressure for increased manpower for the Wehrmacht, was the French Foreign Legion. In north Africa, 300 legionnaires were selected by the Germans and they formed the basis of African Special Purposes Division formed in August 1941 - with most of the legion members being assigned to the 361st Motorised Infantry Regiment within the division. 1 Through its five-year existence, it was re-designated several times, although always known colloquially as the Africa Division, being the only German combat division to have actually been raised in Africa itself.
Subsidiary units
361st Africa Light Infantry Regiment that became part of the division on formation was itself created from former German Foreign Legionaries who had served France before 1940.2 The 288th Special Service Unit, originally known as Sonderverbande 288 was a regimental sized, special operations unit consisting of sub-units with various combat specialties including mountain and desert warfare, night operations and infiltration. This unit was formed in Potsdam in 1941 from specialist soldiers with previous experience in the deserts of the Middle East and North Africa. 3 Two companies from Sonderverbande 288 and one locally recruited Arab company were later amalgamated to form the 155th Rifle (later Panzergrenadier) Regiment within the division. 4
African theater and surrender in Tunisia
It fought for the remainder of the North African campaign, finally surrendering to the Allies in Tunisia in May 1943. It was regarded apparently by the 2nd New Zealand Division as their special foe, as the two formations faced each other on several occasions.
Sardinia and destruction in Italy
As with the other units of the Afrika Korps, replacement units were quickly raised from available troops stationed in Western Europe. As such, the Africa Division was reconstituted as the 90th Panzergrenadier Division in Sardinia during July 1943. Evacuated from Corsica with the Sturmbrigade Reichsf&lt;U+00FC&gt;hrer SS to the Italian mainland in October 1943, the division appeared opposite both the Americans and British as they pushed north. It was then very nearly wiped out in the bitter fighting with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division along the Moro River in late November 1943. A short time later it was withdrawn into reserve at Frosinone and redesignated 90th Grenadier Division (Motorized). While still rebuilding, it was deployed piecemeal along the front in response to the Allies spring offensive in 1944 to serve as a rearguard while the balance of the German units in southern Italy fell back to the Winter Line. Shifted southeast from the Franco-Italian border in September 1944, 90th Grenadier was finally listed as destroyed in the fighting south of Bologna. The remainder of its personnel surrendered to the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB) in Italy in April 1945.
