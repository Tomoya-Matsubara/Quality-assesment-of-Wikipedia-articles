Post-race
Kyle Busch appeared in victory lane to start celebrating his first win of the season in front of 82,000 who attended the race.23 Following his celebration he said, &quot;&quot;I don't know how many times I spun out and didn't spin out, Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around.&quot;24 He also commented, &quot;Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear ... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron -- scared everybody half to death, including me.&quot;25
Stewart, who finished second in the race, said, &quot;I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past.&quot;26 Ragan who was involved in the largest accident of the race, &quot;Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard, You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked.&quot;27 7.46 million people watched the race on television.28
