Richard Bellingham (1592 – 7 December 1672) was a colonial magistrate, lawyer, and several-time governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and the last surviving signatory of the colonial charter at his death. A wealthy lawyer in Lincolnshire prior to his departure for the New World in 1633, he was a liberal political opponent of the moderate John Winthrop, arguing for expansive views on suffrage and lawmaking, but also religiously somewhat conservative, opposing Quakerism. He was one of the architects of the Massachusetts Body of Liberties, a documenting embodying many sentiments also found in the United States Bill of Rights.
Although he was generally in the minority during his early years in the colony, he served ten years as colonial governor, most of them during the delicate years of the English Restoration, when King Charles II scrutinized the behavior of the colonial governments. Bellingham notably refused a direct order from the king to appear in England, an action that may have contributed to the eventual revocation of the colonial charter in 1684.
He died in 1672, leaving an estate in present-day Chelsea, Massachusetts that became embroiled in legal action for more than 100 years after his will was challenged by his only surviving son. He was twice married, with his second wife surviving him by 30 years. He was immortalized in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter.
Early life
Richard Bellingham, the son of William Bellingham and Frances Amcotts, was born in Lincolnshire, England, in about 1592. The family was apparently well to do; they resided in the manor at Bromby Wood.12 He studied the law at Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating on 1 December 1609.3 In 1625 he was elected Recorder of Boston, a position he held until 1633. He represented Boston as a member of Parliament in 1628 and 1629.4 He was first married to Elizabeth Backhouse of Swallowfield, Berkshire, by whom he had a number of children, although only their son Samuel survived to adulthood.5
In 1628 he became an investor in the Massachusetts Bay Company, and was one of the signers of the land grant issued to it by the Plymouth Council for New England. His name also appears on the royal charter issued for the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1629.6 In 1633 he resigned as recorder of Boston and began selling off his properties. The next year he sailed for the New World with his wife and son;7 Elizabeth died not long after their arrival in Boston, Massachusetts.8
Massachusetts Bay Colony
Bellingham immediately assumed a prominent role in the colony, being named to the committee (a precursor to the board of selectmen) that oversaw the affairs of Boston. In this role he participated in the division of community lands that included the establishment of Boston Common.9 Not long after his arrival, he purchased the ferry service between Boston and Winnessimmett (present-day Chelsea) from Samuel Maverick, along with tracts of land that encompass much of Chelsea. In addition to his mansion house in Boston, he also established a country home near the ferry in Winnessimmett.10
He was first elected deputy governor of the colony in 1635, at a time when the dominant John Winthrop was out of favor, and was elected to the post again in 1640.11 According to historian Francis Bremer, Bellingham was somewhat brash and antagonistic, and he and Winthrop were destined to have repeated political clashes.12 During these early years Bellingham contributed to the development of the colony's first legal code, known as the Massachusetts Body of Liberties,13 and was chosen to be on the first board of overseers of Harvard College.14 In 1641 Bellingham was elected governor for the first time, running against Winthrop.15 The Body of Liberties, whose development had been repeatedly stalled by Winthrop, who favored a common law approach to legislation, was formally adopted during his term.16 He was replaced by Winthrop, who won re-election in 1642.17 Bellingham's defeat may have been caused in part by the scandalous impropriety surrounding his second marriage. A friend who was a guest in his house had been courting Penelope Pelham, a young woman of twenty. According to Winthrop, Bellingham, now 50 and a widower, won her heart, and, without waiting for the formalities of the banns of marriage, officiated at his own wedding. When the issue of came before the colonial magistrates, Bellingham (as the governor and chief magistrate) refused to step down from the bench to face the charges, thus ending the matter.18 Bellingham's term in office was characterized by Winthrop as extremely difficult: &quot;The General Court was full of uncomfortable agitations and contentions by reason of Bellingham's unfriendliness to some other magistrates. He set himself in an opposite frame to them in all proceedings, which did much to retard business&quot;.19
In the 1640s constitutional issues concerning the power of the assistants arose. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. John Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because &quot;a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest and worst of all forms of government.&quot;20 Bellingham was one of only two assistants (the other was Richard Saltonstall) who opposed the final decision that the assistants' veto should stand.21 Bellingham and Saltonstall were often in a minority that opposed the more conservative views of Winthrop and Dudley.22 In 1648 Bellingham was again tapped for a committee established to demonstrate that the colony's legal codes were not &quot;repugnant to the laws of England&quot;, as called for by the colonial charter.23
In 1650, when Bellingham was an assistant, he concurred in the judicial decision banning William Pynchon's The Meritorious Price of Our Redemption, which expressed views many Puritans considered heretical.24 Bellingham was again elected governor in 1653, and finally elected once again in May 1665 after the death of Governor John Endecott.25 He was thereafter annually reelected to the post until is death, ultimately serving a total of ten years as governor and thirteen as deputy governor.26 While he was deputy to Endecott in 1656, a boat carrying several Quakers arrived in Boston. Since Endecott was in Salem at the time, Bellingham directed the government's reaction to their arrival. Because Quakerism was anathema to the Puritans, the Quakers were confined to the ship, their belongings were searched, and books propounding their religion were destroyed. After five weeks of captivity, they were sent back to England.27 During Endecott's administration the penalties for Quakers defying banishment from the colony were made progressively harsher, until they included the imposition of the death penalty for repeat offenders. Under these laws, four Quakers were put to death for returning to the colony after their banishment.28
English Restoration
The 1640s and 1650s in England were a time of great turmoil. The English Civil War led to the establishment of the Commonwealth of England and eventually the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell.29 In this period, Massachusetts was generally sympathetic to Cromwell and the Parliamentary cause.30 With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, all of the colonies, and Massachusetts in particular, came under his scrutiny. In 1661 he issued a mandamus forbidding further persecution of the Quakers.31
After numerous requests to return the colonial charter to England for examination, and other dilatory responses by his predecessors to royal demands, Bellingham was directly ordered by Charles to come to England to answer specific charges concerning colonial governance. Bellingham refused to do so, questioning whether the request actually originated with the king, and protesting the colony's loyalty. The magistrates further pacified the angered sovereign by sending over a ship full of masts as a gift (New England was a valuable source of timber for the Royal Navy).
Death and legacy
He died on 7 December 1672 as the last surviving patentee of the colonial charter, and was buried in Boston's Granary Burying Ground.32 He was survived by his son Samuel from his first marriage and his second wife Penelope, who outlived him by 30 years.33 His landholdings at Winnessimmett became tied up on legal action lasting more than 100 years, and involved court and procedural decisions on both sides of the Atlantic to resolve.34 Under the terms of his will, some of his properties in Winnessimmett were set aside for religious uses. His son challenged the will, which was set eventually aside. The litigation continued, carried on by his heirs and succeeding owners and occupants of the properties, and lasted until 1785.35 The town of Bellingham, Massachusetts is named in his honor.36
Bellingham was immortalized as a fictional character in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, as the brother of Ann Hibbins, a woman who was executed (in real life in 1656, as well as in the book) for practising witchcraft.37 There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister — Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals,38 and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her.39
