A total solar eclipse will take place on Monday, August 21, 2017. 
It will have a magnitude of 1.0306 that will be visible from a narrow corridor through the United States. The longest duration of totality will be 2 minutes 40 seconds at  in Christian County, Kentucky just northwest of Hopkinsville, Kentucky.
A partial solar eclipse will be seen from the much broader path of the Moon's penumbra, including all of North America, northern South America, western Europe, and Africa.
This eclipse is a member of Saros series 145, the one that also produced the solar eclipse of August 11, 1999.

This eclipse will be the first total solar eclipse visible from the United States since 1991 (just from part of Hawaii)1, the first visible from the contiguous United States since 19792. A 1991 article in Discover (magazine) noted that &quot;The total solar eclipse of July 11, 1991&quot;, that passed over Hawaii and significant portions of Mexico, &quot;[was] the best anyone will be able to see from the [US land] until 2017.&quot;3
The totality of the Solar eclipse of February 26, 1979 passed only through the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota. Many visitors traveled to the Pacific Northwest to view the eclipse, since it would be the last chance to view a total solar eclipse in the United States for almost four decades.45
Some American scientists and interested amateurs seeking to experience a total eclipse participated in a four-day Atlantic Ocean cruise to view the Solar eclipse of July 10, 1972 as it passed near Nova Scotia. Organizers of the cruise advertised in astronomical journals and in planetarium announcements emphasizing the lack of future U.S. total eclipses until this 2017 event.6
It will be the first with a path of totality crossing the USA's Pacific coast and Atlantic coast since 1918.
The path of this eclipse crosses the upcoming path of the total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024, with the intersection of the two paths being in southern Illinois in Makanda just south of Carbondale. A small land area, including the cities of Carbondale, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and Paducah, Kentucky, will thus experience two total solar eclipses within a span of fewer than seven years.
The Solar eclipse of August 12, 2045 will have a very similar path of totality over the USA, about 250 miles to the southwest, also crossing the USA's Pacific coast and Atlantic coast, however duration of totality will last over twice as long.7
An eclipse of comparable length (up to 3 minutes 8 seconds) occurred over the contiguous United States 8 on March 7, 1970 along the southeast US coast, from Florida to Virginia.
