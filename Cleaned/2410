Nishiura is a small fishing community in the city of Gamagori, Japan. The town itself is non-descript apart from the large collection of onsen, also known as hot springs, found on its beach front. The area is famous for the medicinal properties of its water and a number of hotels have sprung up to accommodate the tourists visiting these spas.
