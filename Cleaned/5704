 Frank Miles Day (1861&lt;U+2013&gt;1918) was a Philadelphia-based architect who specialized in residences and academic buildings. In 1883, he graduated from the Towne School of the University of Pennsylvania, and traveled to Europe. In England, he apprenticed under two architects, and won the 1885 prize from the Architectural Association of London. He returned to Philadelphia, and worked in the offices of George T. Pearson and Addison Hutton, before opening his own office in 1887. Day's first major commission was the Art Club of Philadelphia (1889&lt;U+2013&gt;90, demolished 1975-76), on South Broad Street in Center City, Philadelphia. His brother Henry joined the firm in 1893 (Frank Miles Day &amp; Brother), and Charles Zeller Klauder, who had been his chief draftsman since 1900, became a partner in 1911 (Day Brothers &amp; Klauder). From 1912 to 1927, even after Day's 1918 death, the firm was known as Day &amp; Klauder.
Day was a lecturer in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University, and taught perspective at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He was supervising architect for Yale University and Johns Hopkins University, and supervising or executive architect for Pennsylvania State College (now University), New York University, Delaware College (now University of Delaware), and the University of Colorado.1
Day made major additions to the campuses of the University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania State University and Wellesley College. Day &amp; Klauder designed 18 buildings for Princeton University, although half were Klauder's work, completed after Day's death.2 Day's 1917 master plan for the University of Delaware was inspired by Thomas Jefferson's plan for the University of Virginia.3 Following the firm's 1917 master plan for the Boulder campus, Klauder went on to design much of the University of Colorado.
Day was national president of the American Institute of Architects, 1906&lt;U+2013&gt;07; a founding editor of House &amp; Garden Magazine; and author of a number of books, including American Country Houses of Today (1915).
