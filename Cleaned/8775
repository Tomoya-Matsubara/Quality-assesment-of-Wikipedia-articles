 Adelino da Palma Carlos, GCC, GCIH, GOL, pron. , (Faro, May 3, 1905â€“ Lisbon, October 27, 1992) was a Portuguese lawyer and politician. He was an opponent to the fascist regime of the Estado Novo (New State) of Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Oliveira Salazar (and later Marcelo Caetano) since his youth, and, being a liberal, rather than a socialist, was chosen by President Ant&lt;U+00F3&gt;nio de Sp&lt;U+00ED&gt;nola, as the first prime-minister, after the April 25, 1974 revolution.
As an independent, his 1st Provisional Government, which was in power from May 15 to July 17, 1974, had members of the then center-left Popular Democratic Party, the Socialist Party and even the Portuguese Communist Party, and also Armed Force Movement officers. The ideological diversity of the government seems to be one of the reasons it didn't last, being the main one, the refusal of the anticipated presidential elections, in the same year, before the Constituent Assembly election, 1975. He was replaced by then colonel Vasco Gon&lt;U+00E7&gt;alves, a choice that general Sp&lt;U+00ED&gt;nola latter would regret. After leaving office, Palma Carlos never got involved in politics again.
