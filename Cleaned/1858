U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;113 US&nbsp;113 is a spur of US&nbsp;13 in the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware.  The United States Numbered Highways U.S. Highway runs convert 74.75 mi km from US&nbsp;13 in Pocomoke City, Maryland north to Delaware&nbsp;Route&nbsp;1 DE&nbsp;1 in Milford, Delaware.  In conjunction with DE&nbsp;1, US&nbsp;113 is one of two major northsouth highways on the Delmarva Peninsula with US&nbsp;13 that connect Dover, Delaware Dover with Pocomoke City and the Eastern Shore of Virginia.  The U.S. Highway is the primary northsouth highway in Worcester County, Maryland, where it connects Pocomoke City with Snow Hill, Maryland Snow Hill and Berlin, Maryland Berlin.  US&nbsp;113 is one of three major northsouth highways in Sussex County, Delaware, where it connects Selbyville, Delaware Selbyville and Georgetown, Delaware Georgetown with Milford.  While US&nbsp;113 does not pass through Ocean City, Maryland Ocean City or the Delaware beaches, the U.S. Highway intersects several highways that serve the Atlantic Ocean resorts, including U.S. Route 50 in Maryland US&nbsp;50, Maryland&nbsp;Route&nbsp;90 MD&nbsp;90, U.S. Route 9 in Delaware US&nbsp;9, and DE&nbsp;1.  US&nbsp;113 is a four-lane divided highway for its whole length except for between Snow Hill and Berlin.
US&nbsp;113 follows the corridor of a post road established in the late 18th&nbsp;century to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington, Delaware Wilmington and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Philadelphia.  The highway was improved as an all-weather road in the 1910s.  In Maryland, the post road was designated one of the original state roads established by the Maryland State Highway Administration Maryland State Roads Commission MDSRC in 1909.  In Delaware, the highway was the SelbyvilleDover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont.  The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont's company and finished by the Delaware Department of Transportation Delaware State Highway Department DSHD, spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware.  The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US&nbsp;113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s.  Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became U.S. Route 113 Alternate Delaware US&nbsp;113A.
Expansion of US&nbsp;113 to a divided highway began in the 1950s in Dover.  Much of the remainder of the U.S. Highway in Delaware was expanded in the 1960s; the final section of two-lane US113 in that state was expanded in the mid-1990s.  The Berlin bypass became the first section of US&nbsp;113 to become a divided highway in the mid-1950s.  In the early 1970s, US&nbsp;113 between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill was expanded to a divided highway and the Snow Hill bypass was constructed, replacing what would become U.S. Route 113 Business Snow Hill, Maryland US&nbsp;113&nbsp;Business.  The U.S. Highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was expanded to a divided highway around 2000.  The Maryland State Highway Administration MDSHA is upgrading the last remaining two-lane portions of US&nbsp;113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway.  US&nbsp;113's northern terminus was moved to Milford in 2004 after the U.S. Highway was superseded by DE&nbsp;1 from Milford to Dover.  The Delaware Department of Transportation DelDOT plans to upgrade US&nbsp;113 to a freeway from Selbyville to Ellendale, Delaware Ellendale; a freeway bypass of Milford was cancelled in 2008 because of community opposition.
Route description
US&nbsp;113 has a length of convert 37.49 mi km in Maryland.  Known as Worcester Highway, the highway runs from its southern terminus in Pocomoke City north to the Delaware state line via Snow Hill and Berlin in Worcester County.  In Delaware, US&nbsp;113 is named Dupont Boulevard and extends convert 37.26 mi km from the Maryland state line at Selbyville north to its northern terminus in Milford via Georgetown in Sussex County and a small portion of Kent County, Delaware Kent County.  All of US&nbsp;113 is part of the National Highway System United States National Highway System.
Pocomoke City to Snow Hill
US&nbsp;113 begins in Pocomoke City at an intersection with US&nbsp;13 Ocean Highway, the main highway of the Delmarva Peninsula that connects Wilmington and Dover with Salisbury, Maryland Salisbury and Norfolk, Virginia Norfolk.  Old Virginia Road unsigned Maryland Route 250 MD&nbsp;250A, a section of old alignment of US&nbsp;113, continues west to U.S. Route 13 Business Pocomoke City, Maryland US 13 Business Market Street.  US&nbsp;13&nbsp;Business heads north through the Pocomoke City Historic District, which preserves buildings from Pocomoke City's late 19th&nbsp;century and early 20th&nbsp;century heyday as a river port and station on the main rail line of the Delmarva Peninsula.  Just north of US&nbsp;13, US&nbsp;113 intersects American Legion Drive unsigned MD&nbsp;359B, which leads to Maryland Route 359 MD&nbsp;359 Bypass Road, another section of the old alignment of the U.S. Highway.  The U.S. Route leaves the Pocomoke City area after intersecting Maryland Route 756 MD&nbsp;756 Old Snow Hill Road, the original alignment of US&nbsp;113.
US&nbsp;113 heads northeast as a four-lane divided highway.  The U.S. Highway parallels the east bank of the Pocomoke River at a distance of about convert 1 mi km; the highway crosses many streams that drain into the river, including Pilchard Creek, Bachelors Branch, Mataponi Creek, Corkers Creek, and Hardship Branch.  US&nbsp;113 passes through Pocomoke State Forest, which preserves bald cypress swamps and loblolly pine stands along the Maryland Scenic and Wild River, and by the Shad Landing unit of Pocomoke River State Park.  About convert 1 mi km north of the entrance to the state park, US&nbsp;113&nbsp;Business Market Street splits to the northeast to directly serve the town of Snow Hill, which is the county seat of Worcester County.  US&nbsp;113&nbsp;Business passes through the Snow Hill Historic District, which contains several museums and preserves colonial era buildings of the river port at the :wikt:head of navigation head of navigation of the Pocomoke River.  US&nbsp;113 bypasses the town to the east and intersects Maryland Route 12 MD&nbsp;12 Snow Hill Road, which connects Snow Hill with Salisbury and Stockton, and Maryland Route 365 MD&nbsp;365 Public Landing Road.  After the intersection with MD&nbsp;365, the highway turns north, reduces to a two-lane highway, and crosses Purnell Branch of the Pocomoke River.  US&nbsp;113 crosses the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at grade and turns northeast again as the highway receives the other end of US&nbsp;113&nbsp;Business.
Snow Hill to Berlin

The U.S. Highway traverses Five Mile Branch of the Pocomoke River before the highway veers away from that river and passes into the Atlantic Ocean watershed.  Further north, US&nbsp;113 crosses Massey Branch and Poplartown Branch of Beaverdam Creek, which flow into Newport Bay Maryland Newport Bay.  The U.S. Highway parallels and then intersects the Snow Hill Line at grade and passes by the communities of Newark and Ironshire, which are served by sections of old alignment named Newark Road and Shire Drive, respectively.  Newark is home to the Queponco Railway Station, a preserved Pennsylvania Railroad station.  Ironshire contains the historic home Simpson's Grove.
US&nbsp;113 passes the historic plantation home Merry Sherwood before reaching the intersection with Maryland Route 818 MD&nbsp;818 Main Street just south of Berlin.  MD&nbsp;818, the old alignment of US 113, heads north through the Berlin Commercial District, which contains several museums and preserves buildings from the late 19th&nbsp;century when Berlin was at the intersection of two railroad lines.  US&nbsp;113 bypasses Berlin to the east, where the highway intersects Maryland Route 376 MD&nbsp;376 Assateague Road and Maryland Route 346 MD&nbsp;346 Old Ocean City Boulevard, the old alignment of US&nbsp;50, and passes the historic home Caleb's Discovery.  The U.S. Route intersects US&nbsp;50, which connects Ocean City with Salisbury and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, at a cloverleaf interchange just south of the northern end of MD&nbsp;818, which the highway meets while it parallels the Snow Hill Line.
Berlin to Selbyville
North of Berlin, US&nbsp;113 is a four-lane divided highway that crosses several creeks that come together to form the St. Martin River, which empties into Isle of Wight Bay, a lagoon on the west side of Ocean City.  The first of three sections of old alignment of US 113 north of Berlin, Maryland Route 575 MD&nbsp;575 Worcester Highway, splits to the northeast toward Friendship, Worcester County, Maryland Friendship at a right-in/right-out interchange with the northbound direction.  The U.S. Highway leaves the railroad track and meets MD&nbsp;90 Ocean City Expressway at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD&nbsp;90 connects the northern part of Ocean City with US&nbsp;50 west of Berlin.  US&nbsp;113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD&nbsp;575 and Maryland Route 589 MD&nbsp;589 Racetrack Road, which leads to Ocean Pines, Maryland Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs, a harness racing track with a List of casinos in Maryland slot machine casino that opened in January 2011.  The exit ramp from northbound US&nbsp;113 intersects MD&nbsp;575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589.  Another segment of old alignment serves properties and St. Martin's Episcopal Church Showell, Maryland St. Martin's Episcopal Church between the exit and entrance ramps from southbound US&nbsp;113.  A third section of old alignment parallels the southbound side of the divided highway through Showell, Maryland Showell.  US&nbsp;113 intersects Maryland Route 367 MD&nbsp;367 Bishopville Road in Bishop, Maryland Bishop, crosses the Snow Hill Line at grade at an oblique angle, and intersects the east end of Maryland Route 610 MD&nbsp;610 Whaleyville Road before the highway enters Delaware.
Selbyville to Georgetown

Between Selbyville and Georgetown, the U.S. Highway passes to the west of several towns formed where the original post road crossed streams that flow into the Indian River Delaware Indian River, such as Frankford, Delaware Frankford on Vines Creek.  US&nbsp;113 intersects Delaware Route 26 DE&nbsp;26 Clayton Street/9 Foot Road, which heads east to Bethany Beach, Delaware Bethany Beach, in Dagsboro, Delaware Dagsboro, which was settled at the site of a gristmill on Pepper Creek and is home to Prince George's Chapel.  The route crosses several branches of the Indian River before intersecting Delaware Route 20 DE&nbsp;20 Dagsboro Road, which joins the U.S. Highway in a concurrency road concurrency.  The two highways parallel Delaware Avenue, the old alignment of DE&nbsp;20, as they pass through the fringe of Millsboro, Delaware Millsboro, which was founded at the head of navigation of the Indian River.  US&nbsp;113 intersects Delaware Route 24 DE&nbsp;24 and Delaware Route 30 DE&nbsp;30 Washington Street/Laurel Road on the west side of town.  After crossing Betts Pond, DE&nbsp;20 splits to the northwest as Hardscrabble Road as US&nbsp;113 itself turns northwest toward the hamlet of Stockley, Delaware Stockley.
North of Stockley, US&nbsp;113 intersects Delaware Route 24 Alternate DE&nbsp;24&nbsp;Alternate Speedway Road adjacent to Georgetown Speedway on its way to Georgetown, which was founded as a more central county seat for Sussex County in 1791.  South of the town, the U.S. Highway meets the south end of Bedford Street, which is marked U.S. Route 9 Truck Georgetown, Delaware US&nbsp;9&nbsp;Truck.  The truck route, which bypasses the downtown area of Georgetown, joins US&nbsp;113 in a concurrency.  US&nbsp;9&nbsp;Truck ends at the intersection with U.S. Route 9 in Delaware US&nbsp;9 County Seat Highway/Market Street on the west side of Georgetown.  Along with Delaware Route 404 DE&nbsp;404, US 9 heads east toward Sussex County Airport, the original county seat of Lewes, Delaware Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware Rehoboth Beach, and Dewey Beach, Delaware Dewey Beach.  North of the center of town, US&nbsp;113 intersects DE&nbsp;404 and Delaware Route 18 DE&nbsp;18 Seashore Highway, which head west toward Bridgeville, Delaware Bridgeville and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.  The U.S. Highway meets the other end of Bedford Street before it leaves the Georgetown area.
Georgetown to Milford
Between Georgetown and Milford, US&nbsp;113 heads north through a forested area that surrounds the Ellendale Swamp, which forms the eastern edge of the Nanticoke River watershed.  The U.S. Highway crosses Gravelly Branch and passes through several units of List of Delaware state forests#Redden State Forest Redden State Forest, which was established as a hunting preserve by the Pennsylvania Railroad in the early 20th&nbsp;century.  North of the swamp area, US&nbsp;113 passes to the west of Ellendale, Delaware Ellendale, which flourished in the late 19th-century as a railroad town at the junction of perpendicular rail lines at its Railroad Square.  Ellendale is connected to the U.S. Route by Delaware Route 16 DE&nbsp;16 Beach Highway, which passes through Milton, Delaware Milton, home of the Dogfish Head Brewery, on its way to the Delaware beaches.  North of Ellendale, US&nbsp;113 enters the Delaware Bay watershed; the highway crosses Cedar Creek and passes to the west of Lincoln, Delaware Lincoln.
US&nbsp;113 reaches its northern terminus in Milford, a city founded in the early 19th&nbsp;century at the head of navigation of the Mispillion River that was once a shipbuilding center.  The U.S. Highway intersects Delaware Route 36 DE&nbsp;36 Lakeview Avenue on the southwest side of town before crossing the river into Kent County between two of its impoundments, Silver Lake to the east and Haven Lake to the west.  US&nbsp;113 meets Norfolk Southern Railway's Indian River Secondary railroad track at grade and intersects Delaware Route 14 DE&nbsp;14 Front Street/Milford Harrington Highway.  On the north side of Milford, the U.S. Route intersects Delaware Route 1 Business DE&nbsp;1&nbsp;Business Walnut Street at an oblique angle.  DE&nbsp;1&nbsp;Business joins US&nbsp;113 in a short concurrency that ends when both the state business loop and the U.S. Highway reach their respective northern termini at a partial interchange with DE&nbsp;1.  There is no direct access from northbound US&nbsp;113 to southbound DE&nbsp;1 or from northbound DE&nbsp;1 to southbound US&nbsp;113.
History
US&nbsp;113 was included in the original report laying out the U.S. Highway System in 1925.#Milner Milner, p. 16.  US&nbsp;113 was only marked between Berlin and Dover on the November 1926 map laying out the U.S. Route system.  By 1927, the highway was also marked as US&nbsp;113 on the Pocomoke City to Berlin portion.
Predecessor roads
The original highway along much of the US&nbsp;113 corridor was a post road established in the late 18th&nbsp;century that connected Horntown, Virginia Horn Town on the Eastern Shore of Virginia with Snow Hill, Berlin, Selbyville, Georgetown, Milford, and Dover, ultimately leading to Wilmington and Philadelphia.#Milner Milner, p. 4.  In Maryland, the post road followed what is now MD&nbsp;12 from the Virginia state line through Stockton, Maryland Stockton to Snow Hill.  A separate road connected Pocomoke City and Snow Hill; that highway, as well as the portion of the post road from Snow Hill through Berlin to Bishop, followed the alignment along which US&nbsp;113 would be marked in the early 20th century.  By 1898, the dirt road from Pocomoke City to Berlin via Snow Hill was the main thoroughfare of Worcester County.  North of Bishop, the post road followed the Old Stage Road north to the Delaware state line.
In Delaware, the DoverMilford portion of the post road followed the King's Highway established in the late 17th&nbsp;century to connect Dover with Lewes, the original county seat of Sussex County.  South of Milford, the post road followed a stage road from Dover to Dagsboro constructed to connect the new county seat of Georgetown with Dover in the 1790s.  A 1796 act of the Delaware General Assembly called for the surveying of a straighter convert 30 ft m adj=on wide clear path in Sussex County from Milford through Georgetown and Dagsboro to the Maryland state line, a highway that became known as the State Road by the mid-19th&nbsp;century.#Milner Milner, p. 5.  The path of the State Road remains as a series of unnumbered highways that generally parallel US&nbsp;113 to the east through all of the towns from Selbyville to Milford.  From Main Street in Selbyville, the highway followed Pepper Road to Frankford's Main Street, Clayton Avenue to Dagsboro's Main Street, and Iron Branch Road to State Street in Millsboro.  The State Road continued along Fox Run Drive and Bethesda Road to Stockley, then Zoar Road to Georgetown, through which the highway followed Bedford Street.  The post road used the present alignment of US&nbsp;113 to Redden before traversing Old State Road through Ellendale and Lincoln to Milford, where the highway passed through town as Walnut Street.  From Milford to Dover, the State Road was mostly overlaid by US&nbsp;113.  The two exceptions were through Frederica, where the State Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, where the State Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.
Maryland state roads
When MDSRC was established in 1908, their first major project was to connect all of Maryland's county seats with all-weather roads.  The highway between Pocomoke City and Berlin via Snow Hill was chosen as one of the original state roads in 1909.  Sections of paved highway existed north of Snow Hill, from Ironshire to Berlin, and from Berlin to the northern terminus of present MD&nbsp;818 by 1910.  The highway was paved from Snow Hill to Newark in 1911; the NewarkBerlin section was under construction that year and completed in 1912.  Construction on the Pocomoke City  Snow Hill road was started from the Pocomoke City end in 1911 and completed in 1914.  The highway was paved with a convert 12 to 14 ft m adj=on wide macadam surface except for the final section between Betheden Church Road and Hardship Branch, which was paved with convert 14 ft m adj=on wide Portland cement concrete concrete.  The highway between Berlin and the Delaware state line was constructed as a convert 15 ft m adj=on wide concrete road from the northern end of the existing paved road in Berlin to Showell in 1917 and 1918.  The road from Showell to the Delaware state line was constructed along a new alignment to connect with the southern end of the DuPont Highway by 1921.
The first improvements to US&nbsp;113 in Maryland were the widening of convert 5 mi km of the Snow Hill  Berlin road with the addition of a pair of convert 2 ft m adj=on wide macadam shoulders in 1926.  By the end of 1930, the widening of the Snow Hill  Berlin road to convert 18 ft m in width was completed.  The BerlinDelaware state line road was widened to a convert 20 ft m adj=on width around 1930.  Widening of the Pocomoke City  Snow Hill road began in 1929.  The first bypass of Pocomoke City was completed in 1936.  This bypass, which was built with a convert 20 ft m adj=on wide concrete surface following present day MD&nbsp;359 and unsigned MD&nbsp;250A, replaced Old Snow Hill Road, which was redesignated MD&nbsp;756.  In 1934, MDSRC recommended widening the entirety of US&nbsp;113 from convert 15 to 18 ft m to convert 20 ft m.  However, further widening of US&nbsp;113 did not occur until after World War II.  The U.S. Highway was widened from Snow Hill to the Delaware state line starting in 1947 and from Pocomoke City to Snow Hill beginning in 1949.  Widening was completed on all of US&nbsp;113 in Maryland by 1953.
DuPont Highway

This highway was the brainchild of Thomas Coleman DuPont, who offered to fund and construct a modern highway from Selbyville to Wilmington as a philanthropic measure.  Inspired by the great boulevards of Europe and cognizant of the need for a main northsouth highway as the backbone of a well laid out system of roads in Delaware, DuPont envisioned a convert 200 ft m adj=on right-of-way that contained a convert 40 ft m adj=on wide high-speed automobile highway in the center, surrounded by dual trolley tracks, roadways for heavy vehicle traffic, unpaved roadways for horses above buried utility lines, and sidewalks at the outer edge of the right-of-way.  The construction costs of the road would be recovered by trolley franchises and utility line rentals.  After sections of the highway were built, they would be turned over without charge to the state, which would maintain the road.#Milner Milner, pp. 6, 8.
Despite these grand visions, in the end the DuPont Highway was constructed in Sussex County as a convert 14 ft m adj=on wide concrete roadway on the proposed convert 200 ft m adj=on right-of-way.#Milner Milner, p. 13.  The Delaware General Assembly passed the Boulevard Corporation Act of 1911, which authorized the formation of Coleman DuPont Road, Inc. to acquire land and construct a highway the length of the state.  Construction of the first section of the highway began near Selbyville on September 18, 1911.  By 1912, construction was interrupted by litigation challenging both the constitutionality of the law establishing the road building corporation and the need for DuPont to acquire such a large right-of-way.  DuPont offered to make concessions, such as agreeing to pay up to five times the assessed value of a farmer's land five years after the road's completion and reducing the width of the corridor of land to be acquired to convert 100 ft m.#Milner Milner, p. 10.  Construction on the highway resumed in 1915 after the litigation had taken its course.  The first two sections of the highway, from Selbyville to Georgetown and from Georgetown to a point convert 6 mi km south of Milford, were completed on May 24, 1917.  Despite DuPont's grand boulevard not coming to fruition, his highway was innovative as one of the earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but did not pass directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents.#Milner Milner, p. 14.  Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads.
On July 20, 1918, DuPont reached an agreement with the state of Delaware for the newly-formed DSHD to construct the remaining sections of the highway.  DuPont would dissolve Coleman DuPont Road, Inc. and finance the remainder of construction up to $44,000-per-mile $convert 44000 km mi disp=output number only-per-kilometer, $Formatnum:Inflation US 44000 1918 r=-4-per-mile $convert Inflation US 44000 1918 km mi disp=output number only -4-per-kilometer in CURRENTYEAR dollars.  The highway department would complete the road to Milford along the lines designed by DuPont's company.  The DuPont Highway north of Milford would be both designed and constructed by DSHD, which decided on a convert 60 ft m adj=on wide right-of-way for future sections of the highway.  The portions from north of Ellendale to north of Milford, from Frederica, Delaware Frederica to Little Heaven, Delaware Little Heaven, and through Rising Sun-Lebanon, Delaware Rising Sun were completed by 1920.  All other portions of the DuPont Highway between Ellendale and Dover were under construction in 1920 and completed by 1923, the same year the last section of the entire SelbyvilleWilmington highway was completed near Odessa, Delaware Odessa.
The DuPont Highway was a boon to southern Delaware, which had formerly been economically isolated from the large cities of the northeast.  In conjunction with the rise of the automobile, the highway spurred the growth of the Delaware beaches by greatly improving access to the coast for tourists from northern Delaware and adjacent portions of the Northeast megalopolis.  Southern Delaware also developed into a major truck farming region due to having much greater access to urban markets.  No longer fully reliant on the railroads to transport their goods, farmers in Sussex and Kent counties could market their fruits, vegetables, and broiler chickens directly to consumers in the north.#Milner Milner, p. 28.
By the end of the 1920s, the convert 14 ft m adj=on wide roadway was inadequate for traffic, so US&nbsp;113 was widened to convert 18 ft m adj=on in width with the addition of convert 4 ft m adj=on wide concrete shoulders, then resurfaced with asphalt concrete asphalt.  The highway was widened from Selbyville to Georgetown in 1930, Georgetown to Milford in 1931, and Milford to Dover in 1933.#Milner Milner, p. 26.  After World War II, US&nbsp;113 was widened to convert 22 ft m with the addition of another convert 4 ft m adj=on wide concrete shoulder and asphalt resurfacing.  The U.S. Highway was expanded between Georgetown and Ellendale starting in 1946.  The sections from Selbyville to Dagsboro, from Dagsboro to Georgetown, and from Milford to Little Heaven were expanded beginning in 1947.  The post-war widening of US&nbsp;113 from Selbyville to the Dover Bypass in Little Heaven was completed with work on the U.S. Highway's EllendaleMilford segment in 1949.#Milner Milner, pp. 26, 28.
Dover bypass and expansion
In 1931, DSHD began construction on the first bypass of Dover.  Much of the bypass would use Bay Road, the existing highway from modern Delaware Route 8 DE&nbsp;8 Little Creek Road in Dover to Kitts Hummock on Delaware Bay.  Two sections of new highway were planned from DE 8 to State Street north of downtown Dover, and from the DuPont Highway in Little Heaven north to Bay Road at what is now DE&nbsp;1's interchange with Delaware Route 9 DE&nbsp;9 Bayside Drive at the southern end of Dover Air Force Base.  The new highway between Little Heaven and Bay Road would cross the St. Jones River at a site called Barkers Landing.  Between December 1931 and the end of 1933, DSHD constructed a causeway across convert 3150 ft m of the marsh on the east bank of the river, a process that required multiple applications of fill dirt and dynamite to create a stable surface for a modern highway.  A bascule bridge Scherzer rolling lift bascule bridge was constructed across the St. Jones River in 1934.  Bay Road was widened and the new sections of highway were built with convert 20 ft m adj=on wide concrete pavement starting in 1934.  US&nbsp;113 was relocated to the Dover Bypass north to US&nbsp;13 State Street when the new highway opened for Memorial Day in 1935.  DuPont Highway between Little Heaven and Dover and State Street in Dover were designated US&nbsp;113A.

Small green signs on the traffic light pole masts indicate the roads are named Ocean Highway and Worcester HighwayThe first section of US&nbsp;113 to be expanded to a divided highway was in Dover.  The highway from State Street north of downtown Dover to the modern intersection of US 13 and Bay Road was expanded to a divided highway as part of the same project completed in April 1952 to constructed a southern bypass of Dover for US&nbsp;13 between State Street south of Dover and Bay Road.  US&nbsp;113's course did not change, as it was co-signed with US&nbsp;13 on the expanded portion of Bay Road.  US&nbsp;113's northern terminus was rolled back from State Street to where US&nbsp;13 meets Bay Road in 1966.  The Bay Road divided highway was extended south along US&nbsp;113 to the southern end of Dover Air Force Base in 1959.  US&nbsp;113 between Little Heaven and Dover Air Force Base was expanded to a divided highway in 1984 and 1985; this project included replacing the two-lane drawbridge over the St. Jones River with a four-lane girder bridge.
The first segment of the original DuPont Highway to be expanded to a divided highway was from north of Milford to south of Frederica in 1959.  The divided highway was extended around Milford south to near Lincoln between 1962 and 1964.#Milner Milner, p. 29.  The four-lane divided Frederica bypass was constructed in 1965; Delaware Route 12 DE&nbsp;12 was later extended north from Frederica to the bypass along old US&nbsp;113 Frederica Road.  US&nbsp;113 was expanded to a divided highway from the Maryland state line to Dagsboro between 1965 and 1967.  The divided highway was extended north to Stockley in 1968 and Georgetown in 1969.  The US&nbsp;113DE&nbsp;1 interchange in Milford was built concurrent with the completion of the Milford Bypass in 1971.  US&nbsp;113 between Frederica and Little Heaven was expanded in 1975.#Milner Milner, p. 18.  The final stretch of two-lane US&nbsp;113 in Delaware was eliminated by 1996 when the GeorgetownEllendale section was widened to a four-lane divided highway.
Maryland expansion
The first portion of divided highway in Maryland was the Berlin bypass, which was constructed between 1954 and 1956.  The divided highway extended from Hayes Landing Road north of Ironshire to Deer Park Drive north of Berlin.  The old alignment of the U.S. Highway through Berlin became MD&nbsp;818.  US&nbsp;113 also bypassed Newark and Ironshire in 1956; the relocated highway was constructed as the first carriageway of a future divided highway.  US&nbsp;113's interchange with US&nbsp;50 was built in 1976.  The next section of US&nbsp;113 to become a divided highway was between Pocomoke City and Snow Hill.  The highway was expanded from Pilchard Creek to just west of Hardship Branch in 1971.  The divided highway was extended north to the southern end of the Snow Hill bypass in 1973.  The divided highway was extended south to US&nbsp;13 in Pocomoke City along a new alignment in 1974.  The two-lane Snow Hill bypass was constructed from south of Snow Hill to MD&nbsp;12 in 1973; the bypass was completed to its northern end in 1975.  The bypassed portion of US&nbsp;113 in Snow Hill was designated Maryland Route 394 MD&nbsp;394 in 1977 and then US&nbsp;113&nbsp;Business in 1997.
MDSHA conducted its first study on expanding US&nbsp;113 north of Berlin to a divided highway in the early 1970s.  While US&nbsp;113 was not expanded at that time, preparations for a future expansion were started, including acquisition of right-of-way along the proposed route and the partial construction of an interchange with MD&nbsp;90 in 1976 when that two-lane freeway was constructed.  A second planning study was conducted in the late 1980s; this study recommended intersection improvements instead of constructing a divided highway.  The local group County Residents Action for Safer Highways CRASH formed in response to the significantly higher accident rates along the two-lane sections of US&nbsp;113 compared to the state average.  The high accident rate, which included 42 fatal accidents between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US&nbsp;113 to four lanes.  MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US&nbsp;113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US&nbsp;113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin.

A blue and white sign on the right indicates an ongoing construction project on US&nbsp;113US&nbsp;113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware state line in three sections starting in 1998.  The first section was constructed on a new alignment from north of MD&nbsp;818 to south of MD&nbsp;589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community.  This segment, which included the finishing of the MD&nbsp;90 interchange 24 years after it was first laid out, was completed in 2000.  The second segment of US&nbsp;113 reconstruction, from south of MD&nbsp;589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell.  The second section, including the interchange with MD&nbsp;589, was completed in 2002.  The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line when the a second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road in 2003.  Sections of old alignment of US&nbsp;113 north of Berlin were designated MD&nbsp;575.
Following the expansion of US&nbsp;113 from Berlin to the Delaware state line, MDSHA turned its attention toward the remaining convert 17 mi km of two-lane highway in Maryland between the southern end of the Snow Hill Bypass and Hayes Landing Road north of Ironshire.  In 2006, MDSHA began construction on a five-phase, long-term project to expand US&nbsp;113 between Snow Hill and Berlin to a four-lane divided highway.  Phase 1, which covered convert 4.0 mi km of the Snow Hill bypass from the southern terminus of US&nbsp;113&nbsp;Business to just north of MD&nbsp;365, was completed in 2007.  Phase 2 was divided into two sub-phases.  Phase 2A covered the convert 2.5 mi km of US&nbsp;113 from Goody Hill Road south of Ironshire to Hayes Landing Road and was completed in 2009.  Phase 2B, which covers the convert 1.8 mi km of highway between Massey Branch just north of Newark and Goody Hill Road, began in summer 2009 and is expected to be completed in autumn 2011.  Phase 3 involves the convert 4.4 mi km of roadway between Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill and Massey Branch.  Phase 4 includes the convert 4.5 mi km adj=on section of US&nbsp;113 between the north end of Phase 1 near MD&nbsp;365 north to the south end of Phase 3 at Five Mile Branch Road north of Snow Hill, which will complete US&nbsp;113 as a four-lane divided highway from Pocomoke City to Milford.  Phase 5 will be the construction of an interchange between US&nbsp;113 and MD&nbsp;12 in Snow Hill.  The interchange will be a dumbbell interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad.
Delaware truncation and freeway
DE&nbsp;1 was assigned to the Milford Bypass and the coastal highway south from Milford to the Maryland state line in Fenwick Island in 1974.  DE&nbsp;1 was co-signed with DE&nbsp;14 through the Delaware beach communities until 1977 when DE&nbsp;14 was truncated at Milford.  The DE&nbsp;1 designation was extended north in 1988 along US&nbsp;113 from Milford to Dover and continuing north along US&nbsp;13 toward Christiana, Delaware Christiana to connect the coastal highway portion of DE&nbsp;1 with the Relief Route now the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway to which DE&nbsp;1 was to be assigned between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana.  The DoverSmyrna portion of the DE&nbsp;1 freeway was completed between the east side of Dover and Dover Air Force Base in 1993.  As a result, US&nbsp;113 traffic had to use Exit 95, the interchange for Delaware Route 10 DE&nbsp;10 at the north gate of Dover Air Force Base, to continue north or south on the U.S. Highway.  In 2001, US&nbsp;113 and DE&nbsp;1 were upgraded to a freeway from the southern end of Dover Air Force Base to Exit 95.  US&nbsp;113 was rolled back to Milford in favor of the sole designation of DE&nbsp;1 between the Milford and Dover areas in 2004.  Bay Road became an unnumbered highway between Exit 95 at Dover Air Force Base and the old northern terminus of US&nbsp;113 at US&nbsp;13 in Dover.

In the median are signs indicating the road is entering Delaware.In 2001, the DelDOT conducted a feasibility study for a future northsouth limited access highway in Sussex County.  The Sussex County NorthSouth Transportation Study explored routes along and between the US&nbsp;13, US&nbsp;113, and DE&nbsp;1 corridors.  The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; and the ability to build the limited-access highway in usable sections.  The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US&nbsp;113 corridor, using as much of the current US&nbsp;113 route as possible.  For its standing US&nbsp;113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: MillsboroSouth, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.  asof October 2010, the MillsboroSouth, Georgetown, and Ellendale area studies are in varying stages of progress.  DelDOT has suggested a preferred alternative for the MillsboroSouth area that would follow US&nbsp;113's present alignment through Selbyville, then bypass Frankford, Dagsboro, and Millsboro to the east before rejoining the present course north of Millsboro.  In the Georgetown and Ellendale areas, DelDOT has decided to upgrade the current alignment.  The environmental assessment for Georgetown is ongoing; the Ellendale assessment is complete.
The Milford area study has been dormant since July 2007 due to community opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford.  After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes to the west and east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives.  Both alternatives head east from US&nbsp;113's current alignment west of Lincoln to meet DE&nbsp;1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE&nbsp;1&nbsp;Business.  On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75&nbsp;percent for consensus to have been achieved.  On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US&nbsp;113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route.  Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US&nbsp;113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.

The highway ran convert 9.10 mi km from US&nbsp;113 and DE&nbsp;1 in Little Heaven north to the intersection of US&nbsp;13 and US&nbsp;113 in Dover.  US&nbsp;113A was created in 1936 when US&nbsp;113 moved to a new alignment bypassing downtown Dover.  The alternate route followed US&nbsp;113's original alignment through downtown Dover.  US&nbsp;113A was moved out of downtown Dover in the mid 1970s in favor of following US&nbsp;13 to US&nbsp;113's northern terminus.  The alternate route was removed in 2004 when US&nbsp;113's northern terminus was moved south to Milford.
