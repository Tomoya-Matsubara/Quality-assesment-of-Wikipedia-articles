In spaceflight, the attitude control system (ACS) or attitude determination and control (ADAC) system of a spacecraft consists of equipment to measure, report and change the orientation of the vehicle.1
Components
Some components of the attitude control system include:
Momentum wheels
Reaction wheels
Control moment gyroscopes
Reaction control systems
Attitude sensors such as gyroscopes, rate gyros (in spacecraft this is called Astrionics)

Triad Method
Orientation (geometry)
Dynamics
The ACS causes torques, which spin the spacecraft. With an accurate model of the dynamics of the spacecraft, those torques can be used to control the spacecraft's attitude.
