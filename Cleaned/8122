The Nokia Lumia 2520 is Nokia's first Windows RT tablet computer, and its first tablet computer since the Nokia Internet tablet range.12 It was announced on 22 October 2013 in Abu Dhabi at the Nokia World event, during which the company also unveiled the Lumia 1320 and Lumia 1520 smartphones.3 It was announced after months of media speculation that Nokia would unveil a new tablet.4 The Lumia 2520 will be released in the United States on November 22.5 With the United Kingdom and Finland, with other countries &quot;to follow shortly after. It will compete against the Microsoft Surface 2 and iPad.
The Lumia will cost US$499 while the keyboard will cost US$150.67
Hardware
The Lumia 2520 will come with a 4G LTE and near field communication connectivity and a 6.7-megapixel rear-facing camera. The tablet will be released with Windows RT 8.1 installed, features a Full HD (1920&lt;U+00D7&gt;1080) resolution display, and is powered by a Snapdragon 800 system on a chip which has an integrated Krait 400 quad-core CPU running at 2.2 GHz, and an Adreno 330 GPU for graphics.8
Accessories
Like the Surface 2, Nokia has designed a detachable keyboard called the Nokia Power Keyboard that is outfitted with two USB 2.0 ports and a battery that is expected to extend the tablet's eleven-hour endurance by five hours.9 The keyboard wraps around the rear of the tablet, and so serves as a protective cover.
Software
The device is marketed as a hybrid entertainment and productivity device, and will come with Microsoft's Office productivity suite.10 Also bundled with the tablet will be two of Nokia's proprietary apps &lt;U+2013&gt; Nokia Storyteller and Nokia Video Director.
