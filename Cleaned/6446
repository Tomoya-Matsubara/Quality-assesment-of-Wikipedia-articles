History
The Oregon Statesman was founded on March 28, 1851, by Asahel Bush II, a Democrat, in response to the Whig-controlled Portland-based paper, The Oregonian.2 The paper was originally based in Oregon City, but moved to Salem in 1853 when the Oregon State Capitol was relocated to that city.3 In March 1863, Bush sold the paper and entered the banking field.4 Will H. Parry established the Capital Journal on March 1, 1888, initially as a for-profit venture and an outlet for the Republican Party.5 Parry sold the Journal by the end of the year, one of many ownership changes in subsequent years.
Around 1918, George P. Putnam purchased the Capital Journal and served as editor for 30 years before selling to Bernard Mainwaring in 1953.6 Meanwhile, Charles A. Sprague, who went on to become governor of Oregon, bought the Statesman in 1929.7 In 1954, Mainwaring and Sprague agreed that their respective papers should cooperate closely.8 The Journal moved into the Statesman's new facility and the two papers began sharing printing facilities while keeping independent writers and editors.9
In 1973, both papers were sold to national publisher Gannett Co. Inc., the company that publishes USA Today.10 In 1980, they were combined to form the Statesman Journal.11 Dating to the Statesman's inception, it is the second-oldest Oregon newspaper.12 The paper won ten first-place awards in the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association's annual Better Newspaper Contest in 2001, the most in its division.13 In the 2006 contest, the paper took first place in its division for overall excellence, best editorial page, and best editorial.14 In July 2008, Steve Silberman was named the publisher of the newspaper.15
