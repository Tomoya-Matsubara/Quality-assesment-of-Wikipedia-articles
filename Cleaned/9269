Mulholland Drive (often abbreviated Mulholland Dr.) is a 2001 psychological thriller written and directed by David Lynch. It stars Naomi Watts, Laura Harring and Justin Theroux.
It is noted for its strong use of alluring, surreal images, and plot, which has gained much speculation since the film was released. While being strongly acclaimed by many critics, and a moderate box office success, the film has achieved a cult classic status.
Release and Reaction
Mulholland Drive premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2001 to critical acclaim. Lynch was awarded the Best Director prize at the festival (sharing it with co-winner Joel Coen for The Man Who Wasn't There). In the United States, the film was released in October 2001. Despite mixed audience reaction, it drew positive reviews by many critics. It was named Best Picture by the New York Film Critics Circle, and even more notably was given a four-star review by Roger Ebert, who is known as one of Lynch's biggest detractors.
Lynch was nominated for a Best Directing Oscar for the film. From the Hollywood Foreign Press, the film received four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture (Drama), Best Director, and Best Screenplay. 1 2
Synopsis
As the film begins, a surreal image of people doing the jitterbug is shown. The scene then switches to a young, dark-haired woman (played by Laura Harring) being driven up Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles late at night. She is threatened by two men inside the car with a gun. Before they can kill her, however, their limousine is smashed into by a carload of drag racing teenagers. The nameless, dark-haired woman suffers from a head injury and subsequent amnesia. As the sole survivor of the crash, she wanders down the hillside into LA, finding refuge in the apartment of a vacationing woman and falls asleep. The next day, a young and perky aspiring actress named Betty Elms (played by Naomi Watts), who has just arrived in Hollywood from Deep River, Ontario, moves in and discovers her in the shower. The dark-haired woman sees a poster for the movie Gilda starring Rita Hayworth and decides to call herself &quot;Rita.&quot; She tearfully admits to Betty that she has amnesia and together the two of them try to piece together exactly who she is. While going through Rita's purse for clues, they discover $50,000 in cash and a futuristic-looking blue key.
Other strange things, at first seemingly unrelated, are happening as well. At Winkie's, a local diner, a man named Dan tells his companion Herb about a recurring nightmare involving a shadowy person living behind the restaurant. When Herb encourages Dan to confront his fear by exploring the rear parking lot, Dan encounters a terrifying filthy figure and collapses from fright.
Film director Adam Kesher (played by Justin Theroux) finds his latest project &lt;U+2014&gt; and soon thereafter his life &lt;U+2014&gt; being turned upside down by implacable mobsters, who attempt to coerce him into hiring an unknown blonde actress named Camilla Rhodes (played by Melissa George) to play the lead role in his new film. Adam refuses and finds himself suddenly bankrupt. Later that same evening, after finding his wife cheating on him with the pool cleaner and subsequently checking into a seedy hotel, Adam has a bizarre meeting with a man dressed as a cowboy. He tells Adam that he must give the role to Camilla Rhodes in order for his comfortable life as a director to return to normal.
In another subplot, a bungling hit man steals a &quot;black book&quot; of names and addresses, leaving behind three dead bodies. He, along with two police detectives, are all trying to track down the dark-haired woman now known as &quot;Rita&quot;.

Meanwhile, Betty goes to a Hollywood acting audition and performs brilliantly. Betty is then taken to a soundstage where she catches a glimpse of Adam Kesher, who has just caved in to the mobsters' demands and hired Camilla Rhodes for his new picture. Betty abruptly flees from the soundstage to pick up Rita and follow a clue to the apartment of a mystery woman named Diane Selwyn. This leads to their discovery of a rotting corpse, presumably a murdered Diane. Rita decides to disguise herself by wearing a blonde wig, fearing that the same people who harmed Diane are after her as well. That night, Betty and Rita become lovers and sleep together.

Rita later awakens and insists that she and Betty attend an eerie performance at a midnight theatre called Club Silencio, during which Betty begins shaking and both women cry uncontrollably. They later return to their apartment. Betty suddenly vanishes and Rita, finding herself alone, opens a small blue box with the blue key from her purse. After this, an entirely new reality suddenly emerges. Betty wakes up and finds herself a depressed and lonely failed actress named Diane Selwyn. Her former lover, an actress named Camilla Rhodes (now played by Harring), has abandoned her to pursue a life of riches and glamour by marrying a successful director, the same Adam Kesher who appeared earlier in the film. Feeling betrayed and humiliated, Diane meets with a hit man (the same hit man from the previous reality) at Winkie's and pays him $50,000 in cash to kill Camilla. After receiving confirmation that Camilla has been killed (by the appearance of an ordinary blue key) and now under police suspicion, the guilt-stricken and tormented Diane breaks down into insanity and shoots herself.
Interpretation and allusions
Lynch has refused to comment on the film's &quot;meaning&quot; or symbolism, leading to much discussion and multiple interpretations. The most widely cited interpretation, however, is that the first two-thirds of the film is a dream of the real Diane Selwyn (Watts), who has cast her dream-self as the innocent and hopeful &quot;Betty Elms&quot; (fashioned after a Winkie's waitress named Betty) and reconstructed her life, history, and persona into something like an old Hollywood movie, in which she is successful, charming, and lives the fantasy life of a soon-to-be-famous actress. The last third of the film serves to present the bleak reality of Diane's actual life, a life where her personal and professional wishes and desires have fallen tragically short. 
Production notes/Trivia
Mulholland Drive is an actual road that twists its way through the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles.
The majority of the film was originally shot in 1999 as a 95-minute pilot for a television series on ABC. The network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to pick it up as a series. Lynch filmed new scenes in late 2000 &lt;U+2014&gt; funded with money from French production company StudioCanal &lt;U+2014&gt; to transform the pilot into a feature film.
Laura Harring (Rita) is a former Miss USA.
Naomi Watts (Betty Elms/Diane Selwyn) appeared in the Australian soap opera Home and Away. Coincidentally, Melissa George (the blonde starlet, Camilla Rhodes) and Elizabeth Lackey (the audition singer, Carol) also had roles in Home and Away.
Latina singer Rebekah Del Rio plays herself at the midnight theatre, &quot;lip-synching&quot; an a cappella Spanish version of Roy Orbison's song &quot;Crying&quot;.
The movie features the final film appearance by MGM musical legend Ann Miller.
The DVD release of the film proved controversial when Lynch edited it to obscure the full-frontal nudity of actress Laura Harring, allegedly at her request (to eliminate the possibility of screen captures being circulated widely on the Internet, out of context from the film).
The film is dedicated to Jennifer Syme, a former assistant to David Lynch, who died after a serious car crash in April 2001. Although some believe the car crash in Mulholland Drive is based on Syme, her accident took place after the film had completed its script and shooting production.3
