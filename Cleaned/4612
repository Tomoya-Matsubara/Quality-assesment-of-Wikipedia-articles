William Ford Gibson (born March 17, 1948) is an American-Canadian writer who has been called the &quot;noir prophet&quot; of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction.12 Gibson coined the term &quot;cyberspace&quot; in his short story &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; and later popularized the concept in his debut novel, Neuromancer (1984). In envisaging cyberspace, Gibson created an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s.3 He is also credited with predicting the rise of reality television and with establishing the conceptual foundations for the rapid growth of virtual environments such as videogames and the Web.
Having changed residence frequently with his family as a child, Gibson became a shy, ungainly teenager who often read science fiction. After spending his adolescence at a private boarding school in Arizona, Gibson dodged the draft during the Vietnam War by emigrating to Canada in 1968, where he became immersed in the counterculture and after settling in Vancouver eventually became a full-time writer. He retains dual citizenship.4 Gibson's early works are bleak, noir near-future stories about the effect of cybernetics and computer networks on humans &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;lowlife meets high tech&quot;.5 The short stories were published in popular science fiction magazines. The themes, settings and characters developed in these stories culminated in his first novel, Neuromancer, which garnered critical and commercial success, virtually initiating the cyberpunk literary genre.
Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained associated with Neuromancer, his work has continued to evolve. After expanding on Neuromancer with two more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson became an important author of another science fiction sub-genre&lt;U+2014&gt;steampunk&lt;U+2014&gt;with the 1990 alternate history novel The Difference Engine, written with Bruce Sterling. In the 1990s he composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which focused on sociological observations of near-future urban environments and late capitalism. His most recent novels&lt;U+2014&gt;Pattern Recognition (2003) and Spook Country (2007)&lt;U+2014&gt;are set in a contemporary world and have put his work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.
Gibson is one of the most well known North American science fiction writers,6 f&lt;U+00EA&gt;ted by The Guardian in 1999 as &quot;probably the most important novelist of the past two decades&quot;. Gibson has written more than twenty short stories and nine critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), and has contributed articles to several major publications and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers and musicians. His thought has been cited as an influence on science fiction authors, design, academia, cyberculture, and technology.
Early life
Childhood, itinerance, and adolescence
 William Ford Gibson was born in 1948 in the coastal city of Conway, South Carolina and spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia, a small town in the Appalachians where his parents had been born and raised.78 His family moved frequently during Gibson's youth due to his father's position as manager of a large construction company.9 While Gibson was still a young child, his father choked to death in a restaurant while on a business trip.10 His mother, unable to tell William the bad news, had someone else inform him of the death.11
A few days after the death, Gibson's mother returned them from their home in Norfolk, Virginia to Wytheville.1213 Gibson later described Wytheville as &quot;a place where modernity had arrived to some extent but was deeply distrusted&quot; and credits the beginnings of his relationship with science fiction, his &quot;native literary culture&quot;,14 with the subsequent feeling of abrupt exile.15 At thirteen, unbeknownst to his mother, he purchased an anthology of Beat writing, thereby gaining exposure to the writings of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs; Burroughs had a particularly pronounced effect, greatly altering Gibson's notions of the possibilities of science fiction literature.1617
A shy, ungainly teenager, Gibson consciously rejected religion and took refuge in reading science fiction and edgier, renegade writers such as Burroughs and Henry Miller.1819 At fifteen, he was sent to a private boarding school in Tucson, Arizona by his then &quot;chronically anxious and depressive&quot; mother,20 who had remained in Wytheville since the death of her husband and who died when Gibson was nineteen.2122 Tom Maddox has commented that Gibson &quot;grew up in an America as disturbing and surreal as anything J.G. Ballard ever dreamed&quot;.23
Draft-dodging, exile, and counterculture
 After his mother's death, Gibson left school without graduating and became very isolated for a long time, traveling to California and Europe and immersing himself in the counterculture.242526 In 1967, he elected to move to Canada in order &quot;to avoid the Vietnam war draft&quot;.2728 At his draft hearing, he honestly informed interviewers that his intention in life was to sample every mind-altering substance in existence.29 Gibson has observed that he &quot;did literally evade the draft, as they never bothered drafting me&quot;;30 after the hearing he went home and purchased a bus ticket to Toronto, and left a week or two later.31 In the biographical documentary No Maps for These Territories (2000) Gibson said that his decision was motivated less by conscientious objection than by a desire to &quot;sleep with hippie chicks&quot; and indulge in hashish.32 He elaborated on the topic in a 2008 interview:  In Toronto he found the &lt;U+00E9&gt;migr&lt;U+00E9&gt; community of American draft dodgers unbearable due to the prevalence of clinical depression, suicide and hardcore substance abuse.33 He appeared, during the Summer of Love of 1967, in a CBC newsreel item about hippie subculture in Yorkville, Toronto,34 for which he was paid $500 &lt;U+2013&gt; the equivalent of 20 weeks rent &lt;U+2013&gt; which financed his later travels.35 Aside from a &quot;brief, riot-torn spell&quot; in the District of Columbia, Gibson spent the rest of the 1960s in Toronto, where he met a Vancouver girl with whom he subsequently traveled to Europe.36 Gibson has recounted that they concentrated their travels on European nations with fascist regimes and favourable exchange rates, including spending time on a Greek archipelago and in Istanbul in 1970,37 as they &quot;couldn't afford to stay anywhere that had anything remotely like hard currency&quot;.38
The couple married and settled in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1972, with Gibson looking after their first child while they lived off his wife's teaching salary. During the 1970s Gibson made a substantial part of his living from scouring Salvation Army thrift stores for underpriced artifacts he would then up-market to specialist dealers.39 Realizing that it was easier to sustain high college grades, and thus qualify for generous student financial aid, than to work,40 he enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC), earning &quot;a desultory bachelor's degree in English&quot;41 in 1977.42 Through studying English literature, he was exposed to a wider range of fiction than he would have read otherwise; something he credits with giving him ideas inaccessible from within the culture of science fiction, including an awareness of postmodernity.43 It was at UBC that he attended his first course on science fiction, at the end of which he was encouraged to write his first short story, &quot;Fragments of a Hologram Rose&quot;.44
Post-graduation, early writing, and the evolution of cyberpunk
 After considering pursuing a master's degree on the topic of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature,45 Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records.46 During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater.47 Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley.48 The two became immediate and lifelong friends, and it was Shirley who persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.4950
Through Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner; reading Gibson's work, they realised that it was, as Sterling put it, &quot;breakthrough material&quot; and that they needed to &quot;put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way forward.&quot;5152 Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; &lt;U+2013&gt; the first cyberspace short story &lt;U+2013&gt; to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling &quot;completely got it&quot;.53
In October 1982 Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for ArmadilloCon, at which he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called &quot;Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF&quot;, where Shiner noted &quot;the sense of a movement solidified&quot;.54 After a weekend discussing rock'n'roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring half-jokingly that &quot;a new axis has been formed.&quot;55 Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with Rudy Rucker, went on to form the core of the radical cyberpunk literary movement.56
Literary career
Early short fiction
Gibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of cybernetics and cyberspace (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech shanty towns, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the &quot;sim-stim&quot; package featured so heavily in Neuromancer), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, &quot;Fragments of a Hologram Rose&quot; (1977).57 The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection Burning Chrome, as &quot;Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech.&quot;58
In the early 1980s, Gibson's stories appeared in Omni and Universe 11, wherein his fiction developed a film noir, bleak feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt &quot;an aesthetic revulsion&quot;, expressed in &quot;The Gernsback Continuum&quot;), to the extent that his highest goal was to become &quot;a minor cult figure, a sort of lesser Ballard.&quot;59 When Bruce Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that &quot;people were just genuinely baffled... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp.&quot;60
While Larry McCaffery has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic Darko Suvin has identified them as &quot;undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works&quot;, constituting the &quot;furthest horizon&quot; of the genre.61 The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, the Sprawl setting of &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; and the character of Molly Millions from &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; ultimately culminated in his first novel, Neuromancer.62
Neuromancer
thumb|upright=1.35|Skyscape of Chiba City, the primary setting of Neuromancer, on 2006-11-24.  Neuromancer was commissioned by Terry Carr for the third series of Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was intended to exclusively feature debut novels. Given a year to complete the work,63 Gibson undertook the actual writing out of &quot;blind animal terror&quot; at the obligation to write an entire novel &lt;U+2013&gt; a feat which he felt he was &quot;four or five years away from&quot;.64 After witnessing the first twenty minutes of landmark cyberpunk film Blade Runner (1982) which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he &quot;figured [Neuromancer] was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I&lt;U+2019&gt;d copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film.&quot;65 He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that he would be &quot;permanently shamed&quot; following its publication; yet what resulted was a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist.66
Neuromancer's release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve,67 quickly becoming an underground word-of-mouth hit.68 It became the first novel to win the &quot;triple crown&quot;69 of science fiction awards (the Nebula, the Hugo, and Philip K. Dick Award for paperback original), eventually selling more than 6.5 million copies worldwide.70
Lawrence Person in his &quot;Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto&quot; (1998) identified Neuromancer as &quot;the archetypal cyberpunk work&quot;,71 and in 2005, Time magazine included it in their list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, opining that &quot;[t]here is no way to overstate how radical [Neuromancer] was when it first appeared.&quot;72 According to literary critic Larry McCaffery, the auspiciousness of the novel was in its originality of vision, exhilarating prose, and technological similes and metaphors. He described the concept of the matrix as a place where &quot;data dance with human consciousness... human memory is literalized and mechanized... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman.&quot;73 Gibson later commented on himself as an author circa Neuromancer that &quot;I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money,&quot; and referred to the novel as &quot;an adolescent's book&quot;.74 The success of Neuromancer was to effect the 34-year old Gibson's emergence from obscurity.75
The Sprawl trilogy, The Difference Engine, and the Bridge trilogy
 Although much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in Neuromancer, his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically.76 Despite adding the final sentence of Neuromancer, &lt;U+201C&gt;He never saw Molly again&lt;U+201D&gt;, at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did precisely that with Count Zero (1986), a slower-paced character-focused work set in the Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor.77 He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern space opera, titled The Log of the Mustang Sally, but reneged on the contract with Arbor House after a falling out over the dustjacket art of their hardcover of Count Zero.78 Abandoning The Log of the Mustang Sally, Gibson instead wrote Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), a stylistically virtuosic novel which in the words of Larry McCaffery &quot;turned off the lights&quot; on cyberpunk literature.7980 It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same universe with shared characters, thereby completing the Sprawl trilogy. The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation,81 with both later novels also earning Nebula and Hugo Award nominations.
The Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and is often cited as a central novel of the steampunk genre.82
Gibson's second series, &quot;the Bridge trilogy&quot;, is composed of Virtual Light (1993), a &quot;darkly comic urban detective story&quot;,83 Idoru (1996), and All Tomorrow's Parties (1999). It centers on San Francisco in the near future and evinces Gibson's recurring themes of technological, physical, and spiritual transcendence in a more grounded, matter-of-fact style than his first trilogy.84 The Salon.com's Andrew Leonard notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and artificial intelligences of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media &lt;U+2013&gt; namely tabloid television and the cult of celebrity,85 Virtual Light depicts an &quot;end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the profit motive are taken to their logical conclusion&quot;.86 Leonard's review called Idoru a &quot;return to form&quot; for Gibson,87 while critic Steven Poole asserted that All Tomorrow's Parties marked his development from &quot;science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future.&quot;88
Late period, 21st century incarnation
  After All Tomorrow's Parties, Gibson began to adopt a more realist style of writing, with continuous narratives &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;speculative fiction of the very recent past.&quot;89 Science fiction critic John Clute has interpreted this approach as Gibson's recognition that traditional science fiction is no longer possible &quot;in a world lacking coherent 'nows' to continue from&quot;, characterizing it as &quot;SF for the new century&quot;.90 Gibson's novels Pattern Recognition (2003) and Spook Country (2007) were set in the same contemporary universe &lt;U+2013&gt; &quot;more or less the same one we live in now&quot;91 &lt;U+2013&gt; and put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.92 As well as the setting, the novels share some of the same characters, including Hubertus Bigend and Pamela Mainwaring &lt;U+2013&gt; employees of the enigmatic marketing company Blue Ant.
A phenomenon peculiar to this era was the independent development of annotating fansites, PR-Otaku and Node Magazine, devoted to Pattern Recognition and Spook Country respectively.93 These websites tracked the references and story elements in the novels through online resources such as Google and Wikipedia and collated the results, essentially creating hypertext versions of the books.94 Critic John Sutherland characterised this phenomenon as threatening &quot;to completely overhaul the way literary criticism is conducted&quot;.95
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, with about 100 pages of Pattern Recognition written, Gibson had to re-write the main character's backstory, which had been suddenly rendered implausible; he called it &quot;the strangest experience I've ever had with a piece of fiction.&quot;96 He saw the attacks as a nodal point in history, &quot;an experience out of culture&quot;,97 and &quot;in some ways... the true beginning of the 21st century.&quot;98 He is noted as one of the first novelists to use the attacks to inform his writing.99 Examination of cultural changes in post-September 11th America, including a resurgent tribalism and the &quot;infantilization of society&quot;,100101 became a prominent theme of Gibson's work.102 The focus of his writing nevertheless remains &quot;at the intersection of paranoia and technology&quot;.103 On August 1, 2008, Gibson announced that he was in the process of writing a new novel.104
Collaborations, adaptations, and miscellanea

Literary collaborations
Three of the stories that later appeared in Burning Chrome were written in collaboration with other authors: &quot;The Belonging Kind&quot; (1981) with John Shirley, &quot;Red Star, Winter Orbit&quot; (1983) with Bruce Sterling,105 and &quot;Dogfight&quot; (1985) with Michael Swanwick. Gibson had previously written the foreword to Shirley's 1980 novel City Come A-walkin{{'}}106 and the pair's collaboration continued when Gibson wrote the introduction to Shirley's short story collection Heatseeker (1989).107 Shirley convinced Gibson to write a story for the television series Max Headroom for which Shirley had written several scripts, but the network canceled the series.108
Gibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story &quot;The Angel of Goliad&quot; in 1990,109 which they soon expanded into the novel-length alternate history story The Difference Engine (1990). The two were later &quot;invited to dream in public&quot; (Gibson) in a joint address to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 (&quot;the Al Gore people&quot;110), in which they argued against the digital divide111 and &quot;appalled everyone&quot; by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking place over the Internet.112 In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling had an idea for &quot;a second recursive science novel that was just a wonderful idea&quot;, but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration due to his not being creatively free at the time.113
In 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on Yellow Magic Orchestra's Technodon album,114115 and wrote lyrics to the track &quot;Dog Star Girl&quot; for Deborah Harry's Debravation.116
Film adaptations, screenplays, and appearances
Gibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of Neuromancer on a beach at a Thai resort.117 His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; (which was to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow) and &quot;Neuro-Hotel&quot;, for example, were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made.118 In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of Alien&lt;U+00B3&gt; (which he later characterized as &quot;Tarkovskian&quot;), few elements of which survived in the final version.119 Gibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Russian-Korean star Victor Tsoi.120 Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the &quot;wonderfully odd project&quot; which involved &quot;ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future Leningrad&quot; and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended after Tsoi's death in an automotive accident, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel Let's Put the Future Behind Us and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's Pattern Recognition.121 A similarly doomed fate befell Gibson's mooted collaboration with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991,122 a film they plotted on shooting in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.123  Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game.124 Neuromancer, after a long stay in development hell, is in the process of adaptation as of 2007,125 Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought.126 An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006,127 and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project.128 Television is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with friend Tom Maddox, The X-Files episodes &quot;Kill Switch&quot; and &quot;First Person Shooter&quot;, broadcast in the U.S. on 20th Century Fox Television in 1998 and 2000.129130 In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off publication Art of the X-Files. Gibson made a cameo appearance in the television miniseries Wild Palms at the behest of creator Bruce Wagner.131 Director Oliver Stone had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the series,132 and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an article, &quot;Where The Holograms Go&quot;, to the Wild Palms Reader.133 He accepted another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside Douglas Coupland in the short film Mon Amour Mon Parapluie in which the pair played philosophers.134 Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical documentary film by Mark Neale in 2000 called No Maps for These Territories. The documentary follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations from Neuromancer by Bono and The Edge.135
Exhibitions, poetry, and performance art
 Gibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of performance art pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future Johnny Mnemonic director Robert Longo136 titled Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes, which was displayed in Royce Hall, University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to &quot;Memory Palace&quot;, a performance show featuring the theater group La Fura dels Baus at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by Karl Sims, Rebecca Allen, Mark Pellington with music by Peter Gabriel and others.137 It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and &quot;cyberprops&quot; designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based contemporary dance company Holy Body Tattoo and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.138
In 1990, Gibson contributed to &quot;Visionary San Francisco&quot;, an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art shown from June 14 to August 26.139 He wrote a short story, &quot;Skinner's Room&quot;, set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco &lt;U+2013&gt; Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and taken over by the homeless &lt;U+2013&gt; a setting Gibson then detailed in the Bridge trilogy. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge.140 The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from &quot;Skinner's Room&quot;.141 The New York Times hailed the exhibition as &quot;one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade&quot;, despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution &quot;a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work&quot;.142 A slightly different version of the short story was featured a year later in Omni.143
A particularly well-received work by Gibson was Agrippa (a book of the dead) (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr.144 Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5&quot; floppy disk embedded in the back of an artist's book containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light &lt;U+2013&gt; they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design &quot;eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself.&quot;145 Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually &quot;hacked&quot;; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox BBS the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.146
Journalism
Gibson is a sporadic contributor to Wired, and has written for The Observer, Addicted to Noise, New York Times Magazine and Rolling Stone. His first major piece of nonfiction, the article &quot;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&quot; concerning the city-state of Singapore, resulted in Wired being banned from the country and attracted a spirited critical response.147148 He commenced writing a blog in January 2003, providing voyeuristic insights into his reaction to Pattern Recognition, but abated in September of the same year due to concerns that it might negatively affect his creative process.149150 Gibson re-commenced blogging in October 2004, and during the process of writing Spook Country frequently posted short nonsequential excerpts from the novel to the blog.
Influence and recognition
 Hailed by The Guardian in 1999 as &quot;probably the most important novelist of the past two decades&quot; in terms of influence,151 Gibson first achieved critical recognition with his debut novel, Neuromancer. The novel won three major science fiction awards (the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award), an unprecedented achievement described by the Mail &amp; Guardian as &quot;the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and Pulitzer prizes in the same year&quot;.152 Neuromancer gained unprecedented critical and popular attention outside science fiction,153 as an &quot;evocation of life in the late 1980s&quot;,154 although The Observer noted that &quot;it took the New York Times 10 years&quot; to mention the novel.155
Gibson's work has received international attention156 from an audience that was not limited to science fiction aficionados as, in the words of Laura Miller, &quot;readers found startlingly prophetic reflections of contemporary life in [its] fantastic and often outright paranoid scenarios.&quot;157 It is often situated by critics within the context of postindustrialism as, according to academic David Brande, a construction of &quot;a mirror of existing large-scale techno-social relations&quot;,158 and as a narrative version of postmodern consumer culture.159 It is praised by critics for its depictions of late capitalism160 and its &quot;rewriting of subjectivity, human consciousness and behaviour made newly problematic by technology.&quot;161 Tatiani Rapatzikou, writing in The Literary Encyclopedia, identifies Gibson as &quot;one of North America's most highly acclaimed science fiction writers&quot;.162
Cultural significance
In his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in The Literary Encyclopedia with effectively &quot;renovating&quot; science fiction, a genre at that time considered widely &quot;insignificant&quot;,163 influencing by means of the postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in science fiction studies.164 In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions &quot;struck sparks in the real world&quot; and &quot;determined the way people thought and talked&quot; to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature.165 The publication of Neuromancer (1984) hit a cultural nerve,166 causing Larry McCaffery to credit Gibson with virtually launching the cyberpunk movement,167 as &quot;the one major writer who is original and gifted to make the whole movement seem original and gifted.&quot;168 Aside from their central importance to cyberpunk and steampunk fiction, Gibson's fictional works have been hailed by space historian Dwayne A. Day as some of the best examples of space-based science fiction (or &quot;solar sci-fi&quot;), and &quot;probably the only ones that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking&quot;.169  Gibson's early novels were, according to The Observer, &quot;seized upon by the emerging slacker and hacker generation as a kind of road map&quot;.170 Through his novels, such terms as cyberspace, netsurfing, ICE, jacking in, and neural implants entered popular usage, as did concepts such as net consciousness, virtual interaction and &quot;the matrix&quot;.171 In &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; (1982), he coined the term cyberspace, referring to the &quot;mass consensual hallucination&quot; of computer networks.172 Through its use in Neuromancer, the term gained such recognition that it became the de facto term for the World Wide Web during the 1990s.173 Artist Dike Blair has commented that Gibson's &quot;terse descriptive phrases capture the moods which surround technologies, rather than their engineering.&quot;174
Gibson's work has influenced several popular musicians: references to his fiction appear in the music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, Straylight Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in Neuromancer)175 and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer,176 and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson.177 He returned the favour by writing an article about the band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August 2005.178 The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer. 179
The landmark cyberpunk film The Matrix (1999), drew inspiration for its title, characters and story elements from the Sprawl trilogy.180 The characters of Neo and Trinity in The Matrix are similar to Bobby Newmark (Count Zero) and Molly (&quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;, Neuromancer).181 Like Turner, protagonist of Gibson's Count Zero, characters in The Matrix download instructions (to fly a helicopter and to &quot;know kung fu&quot;, respectively) directly into their heads, and both Neuromancer and The Matrix feature artificial intelligences which strive to free themselves from human control.182 Critics have identified marked similarities between Neuromancer and the film's cinematography and tone.183 In spite of his initial reticence about seeing the film on its release,184 Gibson later described it as &quot;arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact.&quot;185 In 2008 he received honorary doctorates from Simon Fraser University and Coastal Carolina University, 186 and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame by close friend and collaborator Jack Womack.187
Visionary influence and prescience
In Neuromancer, Gibson first used the term &quot;matrix&quot; to refer to the visualised Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the computer networks of the 1970s.188189190 Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide communications network years before the origin of the World Wide Web,191 although related notions had been previously been imagined by others, including science fiction writers. At the time he wrote &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;, Gibson &quot;had a hunch that [the Internet] would change things, in the same way that the ubiquity of the automobile changed things.&quot;192 In 1995, he identified the advent, evolution and growth of the Internet as &quot;one of the most fascinating and unprecedented human achievements of the century&quot;, a new kind of civilization that is &lt;U+2013&gt; in terms of significance &lt;U+2013&gt; on a par with the birth of cities,193 and in 2000 predicted it would lead to the death of the nation state.194
Observers contend that Gibson's influence on the development of the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream.195 Gibson introduced, in Neuromancer, the notion of the &quot;meatpuppet&quot;, and is credited with inventing&lt;U+2014&gt;conceptually rather than participatorally&lt;U+2014&gt;the phenomenon of virtual sex.196 His influence on early pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged,197 and he holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design.198 Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the &quot;conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in videogames and the Web&quot;.199 In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking &quot;what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?&quot;200
 Gibson scholar Tatiani G. Rapatzikou has commented, in Gothic Motifs in the Fiction of William Gibson, on the origin of the notion of cyberspace:
In his Sprawl and Bridge trilogies, Gibson is credited with being one of the few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the sociospatial structuring of cities.201 Not all responses to Gibson's visions have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer Mark Pesce, though acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that &quot;no other writer had so eloquently and emotionally effected the direction of the hacker community,&quot;202 dismissed them as &quot;adolescent fantasies of violence and disembodiment&quot;.203 In Pattern Recognition, the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 Lonelygirl15 internet phenomenon. However, Gibson later disputed the notion that the creators of Lonelygirl15 drew influence from him.204 Another phenomenon anticipated by Gibson is the rise of reality television,205 for example in Virtual Light, which featured a satirical extrapolated version of COPS.206
For his part, Gibson rejects any notion of prophecy, never having had a special relationship with computers &lt;U+2013&gt; until 1996 he did not have an email address, or even a modem, which he claimed at the time was motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing.207 His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when he was persuaded to let a web developer, Chris Halcrow, build one for him.208 An anecdote often recited in cybercultural enclaves and English departments holds that Neuromancer was written on a manual typewriter;209 the author has confirmed that the novel was written on a 1927 model of an olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which looked to him as &quot;the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field&quot;.210 In 2007 he said:

Footnotes
I.  The New York Times Magazine211 and Gibson himself212 report his age at the time of his father's death to be six years old, while Gibson scholar Tatiani Rapatzikou claims in The Literary Encyclopedia that he was eight years old.213
II.  Several track names on Hamm's Kings of Sleep album (&quot;Black Ice&quot;, &quot;Count Zero&quot;, &quot;Kings of Sleep&quot;) reference Gibson's work.214
III.  Idol released an album in 1993 titled Cyberpunk, which featured a track named Neuromancer.215 Robert Christgau excoriated Idol's treatment of cyberpunk,216 and Gibson later stated that Idol had &quot;turned it into something very silly.&quot;217
IV.  Zevon's 1989 album Transverse City was inspired by Gibson's fiction.218
V.  Gibson later successfully resisted attempts by Autodesk to copyright the word for their abortive foray into virtual reality.219
VI.  Both the internet with its dramatic social effects and the cyberpunk genre itself were also anticipated in John Brunner's 1975 novel The Shockwave Rider.220221
VII.  The idea of a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site was first described in 1962 in a series of memos on the &quot;Galactic Computer Network&quot; by J.C.R. Licklider of DARPA.222
