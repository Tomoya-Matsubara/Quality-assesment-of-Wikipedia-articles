Jonathan Albaladejo (born October 30, 1982 in San Juan, Puerto Rico) is a Major League Baseball relief pitcher who currently plays for the New York Yankees. He is on the 60-day disabled list with a sprained right elbow ligament.
Career
Albaladejo was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 34th round (1021st overall) of the 2000 amateur entry draft, but didn't sign. The following year he was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 19th round (564th overall), and signed on June 6, 2001.
He spent a number of years in the minors in the Pirates system as a starting pitcher, and then in 2005 was converted to a reliever.
On May 3, 2007 he was signed to a minor league contract by the Washington Nationals, and played most of the season at AA Harrisburg, compiling a 4.17 earned run average in 21 appearances. He moved up to AAA Columbus and finished the season extremely well, posting an ERA of 0.78 in 14 appearances. When rosters expanded in September, the Nationals, then leading the league in innings pitched by relievers, brought him up.
On September 4, 2007, Albaladejo made an auspicious debut. In the top of the third inning, in a game against the Florida Marlins, Tim Redding was injured by a batted ball and needed to be replaced. Albaladejo entered the game with two men on and one out, and allowed a ground ball (where an inherited runner scored) and a pop up. In the fourth inning, Albaladejo struck out the side, and then was relieved1.
On December 4, 2007 he was traded to the New York Yankees for starting pitcher Tyler Clippard.2
During the 2007-08 offseason, Albaladejo pitched for the Tiburones de La Guaira in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League.
He made the Yankees' opening day roster, but would only pitch in 9 games in the 2008 season because of an elbow injury suffered on May 9, 2008.
