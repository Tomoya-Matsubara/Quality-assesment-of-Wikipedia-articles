The Battle of Buna &lt;U+2013&gt; Gona was part of the New Guinea campaign in the Pacific campaign of World War II. On 16 November 1942, Australian and United States forces attacked the main Japanese beachheads in New Guinea, at Buna, Sanananda and Gona. When the Japanese forces were within sight of Port Moresby, the Japanese leadership decided holding Guadalcanal was a higher priority, and they ordered their New Guinea forces to withdraw to the coast. Since arriving on the north coast in June, the Japanese had built hundreds of well-camouflaged, reinforced bunkers in mutually supporting positions blocking all available approaches. Combined with the forces who had returned from the Kokoda Track, the Japanese initially had nearly 5,500 troops on the northern coast. This rose to about 6,500 later in the battle. Both the Japanese and Allied forces were riddled by disease and lacked the most basic supplies, including medicine and food.1 Some U.S. troops were reduced to a small portion of a C ration each day.
Allied Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur and his staff received poor intelligence and vastly underestimated the number of defenders and the superior quality of the Japanese defensive system. MacArthur&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief of staff Lt. Gen. Richard K. Sutherland glibly referred to the Japanese fortifications as &quot;hasty field entrenchments.&quot; The Allies had only a few artillery and mortar pieces and ammunition was so limited it was rationed. No tank or naval support was available, and air support was only partially effective. When the Allies attacked on three fronts, they were immediately stymied by the excellent Japanese defensive position. The Allies suffered heavy casualties and gained virtually no ground.
MacArthur repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction with the U.S. 32nd Infantry Division's inability to defeat the Japanese. On 29 November, after 13 days of poor results and high casualties, Lieutenant General Eichelberger relieved Harding of command. Eichelberger's later assumed command and only then fully appreciated the difficulty faced by the Allies in overcoming the Japanese forces. He learned that the majority of his troops had fevers and were sick with a variety of illnesses including malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, and tropical dysentery.
The Allied forces only made significant progress when they were finally given the tanks and artillery they had long sought. On 2 January, they captured Buna, and on 22 January 1943, after prolonged intense fighting in extraordinarily difficult conditions, the Allied forces killed or captured almost the entire defending Japanese forces. Only a few hundred escaped to the north. Casualties on both sides were extremely high. General Eichelberger later compared the casualty ratio to the American Civil War. As a percentage of casualties, killed or wounded in action at Buna exceeded the better known Battle of Guadalcanal by a margin of three to one.
Background
After the failure of the Japanese in the Battle of the Coral Sea to take Port Moresby by sea, they had landed on the north coast of New Guinea on 21 July 1942 and established beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda. From there, they had attacked over the Kokoda Track in an attempt to take Port Moresby by land. Meeting the Japanese on the Kokoda Track, the vastly outnumbered Australian forces fought a two-month defensive battle, pushed back over the track toward Port Moresby over very difficult terrain by the superior Japanese forces. Within  of Port Moresby, 80% of the Japanese forces had been wounded, killed or disabled by disease. The Japanese troop's medical care was virtually non-existent, many were out of food, and nearly all of the men were sick.2 Nonetheless, Lieutenant General Tomitar&lt;U+014D&gt; Horii wanted to push forward to Port Moresby. His unit paused on a hill just east of Imita Ridge, where his troops could see Port Moresby's lights reflected in the sky, and waited for the reinforcements promised him. When he instead received orders to withdraw so the Imperial Forces could concentrate their resources on the battle for Guadalcanal, he was despondent.3
The Australian forces counterattacked the retreating Japanese, fighting a series of tough battles against Japanese rearguard defences on the narrow mountain track. The Japanese established a defensive line at Eora Creek, but after several days of fighting, they left their position to be defended by sick and wounded troops while the remainder escaped to the coast. The Australians continued to attack the withdrawing Japanese until they reached the more heavily defended lines near the Buna-Gona perimeter. During late August and early September 1942, Australian forces defeated Japan's attempt to capture strategically important Milne Bay on the southeastern tip of New Guinea. It was the first time in the Pacific war that the Allies had prevented the Japanese from capturing their objective.4
Impenetrable terrain
The terrain in the Buna-Gona area was principally a swamp. The foothills of the Owen Stanley Range spread out into a flat plain  inland only  above sea level. The land near the beach at Buna was  above sea level. The Girua River,  wide at the point it left the foothills, entered a vast tidal swamp, where it broke into several minor creeks from Sanananda Point on the north to Buna Village on the south. Between two of these creeks, Entrance Creek and Simemi Creek, lay an impenetrable swamp. On the periphery lay dense jungle bush including  tall, sharp-edged, kunai grass, thick forest and more swamp. The temperature averaged  and the humidity 85%.5 It rained up to  daily.
Tangled among the closely spaced  high trees was a tangle of roots, creepers, and brush. Visibility from a fox hole was practically zero. If a man stood, which guaranteed he would be shot at, he could only see . If the ground was not actually swamp, it was thoroughly waterlogged. The only way across was via a few native tracks that followed the higher ground, but even they were always muddy and thoroughly soaked in wet weather. The Japanese had placed their camouflaged bunkers on high ground at key points across all possible access points. Vehicle travel was impossible.6 The bush, swamp, forest, rivers and beach made it virtually impossible to flank the Japanese positions. Along the edge of the sea was a strip of dry, sandy soil where the Japanese had built emplacements.7
Strong Japanese defences

The Japanese were now commanded by Major General Kensaku Oda, succeeding Lieutenant General Tomitar&lt;U+014D&gt; Horii, who had drowned in the Kumusi River8 while retreating from their initial attack across the Kokoda Track on Port Moresby.
Unable to dig deep foxholes or shelters due to the  deep water table, the Japanese had instead built hundreds of coconut log bunkers.9 The bunkers were often linked by trenches allowing the Japanese to move at will among them, reinforcing one another.10 The bunkers were normally supported by infantry in firing pits to the front, sides and rear.11 Some of the larger bunkers were protected with steel plate or steel rails and  barrels filled with sand.12 A handful of pillboxes near the abandoned airstrip about a mile from the Buna Mission were built using steel and concrete. Some blockhouses were covered in earth that protected them from artillery fire and concealed with fast-growing jungle vegetation. Blockhouses covered in earth concealed four or five machine gun emplacements and could hold 20&lt;U+2013&gt;30 soldiers. The bunkers and fortifications were built with mutually supporting lines of fire and organised in depth.13
Many smaller fortifications were placed in perimeter positions that were thick with trees or jungle vegetation. Well-concealed firing slits were a few feet above ground. The bunkers rose only  high, and were so well concealed that the emplacements were virtually invisible to attackers until the Japanese unleashed their weapons on the unsuspecting Allied troops. All of these positions could generate devastating interlocking fields of fire, supported by many snipers hidden in tall trees.14
Buna was General Douglas MacArthur's first ground offensive campaign against Japanese troops in World War II.15 He received intelligence from Brigadier General Charles Willoughby, who told MacArthur before the operation that there was &quot;little indication of an attempt to make a strong stand against the Allied advance.&quot;16 Other intelligence he received led him to believe that Buna was held by about 1000 sick and malnourished soldiers. Unfamiliar with the state of Japanese defences, Lieutenant General Richard K. Sutherland, MacArthur&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief of staff, glibly referred to these fortifications as &quot;hasty field entrenchments.&quot;1718
Japanese forces and supply lines
The Japanese defences were concentrated in three strongholds.19 One was at Gona, under Major Tsume Yamamoto; another was around Sanananda, under Colonel Yosuke Yokoyama (who was in overall command of Imperial Japanese Army forces in the Buna-Gona area); and the third and largest Japanese stronghold was in the Buna area, under Special Naval Landing Forces Captain Yoshitatsu Yasuda. Although these positions were separate, communications between them and Japanese supply lines were initially strong.20 At the outset, the Japanese were able to maintain supply lines to Rabaul and to evacuate wounded personnel by sea, using submarines to maintain contact with the beachheads. It took almost two months for the Allies to finally cut the Japanese sea lanes of communication, reinforcement, and re-supply.21
The Japanese garrison was a mix of army and naval forces. It initially numbered about 5,50022 The 2nd and 3rd battalion of the 41st Infantry Regiment, plus the 144th Infantry Regiment and the 15th Independent Engineer Regiment occupied fortified positions on the Allied force's left wing, defending the Soputa-Sanananda Road and the trail to Cape Killerton. The 3rd Battalion of the 41st Infantry Regiment, a divisional cavalry detachment, and the 47th Field Anti-Aircraft Battalion fielding a battery of 8 mobile Type 88 75mm Field Anti-Aircraft guns23 were on the Allied's right wing guarding the beachheads. In addition to these army units, there were about 500 marines from the 5th Yokosuka and 5th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Forces present.24
The 1st Battalion of the Japanese 41st Infantry Regiment were positioned at Gona. During the night of 1&lt;U+2013&gt;2 December, about 1000 troops belonging to the Yamagata Brigade, consisting of the Brigade Headquarters, the 3rd Battalion of the 170th Infantry Regiment, and a battery of mountain artillery landed north of Gona, bringing the total Japanese strength in the Sanananda area to between four and five thousand. This was at least twice the strength of the Buna garrison. A second detachment of the Yamagata Brigade, also totalling about 1,000, landed near the mouth of the Mambare River on the night of 12&lt;U+2013&gt;13 December. The reinforcements brought the Japanese strength to about 6,500.25
Allied forces unprepared
MacArthur felt pressure to produce a victory. He was intent on returning to Manila, although Admiral Chester Nimitz wanted to advance through the central Pacific via the Gilberts, Marshalls, Marianas, Carolines, and Palau Islands, while the British and her Dominions thought Java ought to be the primary focus.2627 In Washington, Fleet Admiral Ernest King&lt;U+2014&gt;Commander in Chief, United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations&lt;U+2014&gt;was not completely satisfied with MacArthur sharing command with Admiral Chester Nimitz and held out hope that Nimitz might get overall command.28 MacArthur's repeated requests for naval support were often simply put aside, and MacArthur felt the Admiral's antipathy. MacArthur's position as Supreme Commander was mostly a political and strategic appointment and did not give him any direct combat command.29 MacArthur did however enjoy a close relationship with Australian Prime Minister John Curtin, who strongly admired MacArthur. MacArthur&lt;U+2014&gt;who had to depend on Australian commanders to carry out his plans&lt;U+2014&gt;often used his influence with Curtin to obtain changes in Australian decisions. Australian General Sir Thomas Blamey exercised command of all Allied land forces but he was not well liked.30
Allied intelligence deficient
Allied intelligence in the lead-up to the battle was deficient in two key areas. First, &quot;In a major intelligence blunder, Allied staffs told frontline commanders that they faced no more than 1,500 to 2,000 enemy and could expect the Japanese to surrender about 1 December.&quot;31 Other intelligence described the Japanese defenders as &quot;sick and malnourished&quot; when in fact some 6,500 enemy from the Imperial Japanese Army and marines from the Special Naval Landing Forces held the beachhead.323334 The Allies had very poor maps and limited reconnaissance photos of the area, which would later make it extremely difficult to accurately position and target artillery.35 Based on what little they knew about the area, Allied intelligence believed that widespread swampland would render the construction of strongpoints in the Buna-Gona area impossible. Buna was Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur's first ground offensive campaign against Japanese troops in World War II.
MacArthur received intelligence from Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, who told MacArthur before the operation that there was &quot;little indication of an attempt to make a strong stand against the Allied advance.&quot;36 Unfamiliar with the state of Japanese defences, Lieutenant General Richard K. Sutherland, MacArthur&lt;U+2019&gt;s chief of staff, glibly referred to these fortifications as &quot;hasty field entrenchments.&quot; All of this information led MacArthur to believe that Buna could be taken with relative ease.37 Other intelligence he received him to believe that Buna was held by about 1000 sick and malnourished soldiers.
Inadequate training
Staff officers considered the U.S. 32nd Infantry Division unprepared and undersupplied for combat.38 While in the U.S., the division had trained for a European war. Standard U.S. Army practices dictated that a division should train together for a year,39 but the 32nd had picked up more than 3,000 replacements fresh out of boot camp when the division was suddenly redirected to Australia.40 When in Australia, they had moved to three different camps and were tasked with building one of them.41 What limited training they had received in Australia had been to prepare them to fight in Australia's outback to defend the country from Japanese attack. Their heavy-weight Herringbone Twill combat uniforms were the wrong color. Learning from the experience of Australian soldiers, who in the early part of the Kokoda Track campaign wore tan uniforms that stood out against the jungle, the Americans had two sets of their uniforms dyed a darker green at a dry cleaner in Brisbane.42 Unfortunately, the dye was more like paint and would not allow the cloth to wick moisture away from the skins, causing skin diseases.43 The 32nd was not trained, equipped or prepared to fight in the jungle nor taught Japanese tactics.4445
Unprepared for jungle warfare
Nonetheless, the Division was the most well-prepared of the 32nd, and MacArthur insisted in October 1942 that it be immediately moved from Australia to New Guinea. The beginning of the campaign revealed that the American troops were unprepared for jungle warfare. The 2nd Battalion of the 126th Infantry Regiment was called on to trek  from 14 October &lt;U+2013&gt; 12 November across the extremely rugged Kapa Kapa Trail. They did not encounter a single enemy soldier, but more than &lt;U+2154&gt; of their men became casualties, sick with malaria, dengue fever, bush typhus, amoebic dysentery, bacillary, along with jungle rot, dobie itch, trench foot, athlete's foot and ringworm.46
Exhausted from their march, the division stopped for one week at Natunga to resupply. They then were directed to the front lines against seasoned Japanese combat veterans, and in the ensuing battle soon ran short of weapons, medicine and even food.47
Scant artillery support
The Allies initially lacked armour, artillery, naval support and air support for their attack.48 The division was normally assigned a complement of thirty-six  howitzers and twelve  howitzers. But due to a lack of transportation, these had all been left in Australia. American officers, especially General George Kenney&lt;U+2014&gt;Commander of the Allied air forces in the Southwest Pacific Area&lt;U+2014&gt;argued against artillery support as unnecessary. Although he had no knowledge of jungle warfare, he told MacArthur that tanks had no role in ground action in the jungle.49
Major General Edwin Harding, commanding officer of the 32nd Infantry Division, reluctantly accepted MacArthur's decision to go ahead with the attack and to rely on direct air support in place of tanks or heavy artillery. Harding and his artillery commander&lt;U+2014&gt;Brig. Gen. Samuel Waldron&lt;U+2014&gt;finally persuaded MacArthur's headquarters to break down one 105 mm howitzer and fly it to Pongani, where it was moved closer to Buna for fire support. They also borrowed eight 25-pounder guns from the Australians.
Allied supply lines distant
The Allies' major bases&lt;U+2014&gt;at Port Moresby and Milne Bay&lt;U+2014&gt;were distant. The Owen Stanley Ranges were impassable to motor vehicles. The Imperial Japanese Navy and air forces controlled the Bismarck Sea to the north of New Guinea. The attacking troops initially were dependent on airdrops by the Liberator cargo planes of the U.S. Fifth Air Force and makeshift transport units assembled by the Royal Australian Air Force, as well as coastal shipping, which was vulnerable to air attack. On 2 November, while the 126th Infantry Regiment was crawling on their hands and knees over portions of the Kapa Kapa Track and the  Owen Stanley Range, a local missionary suggested an alternative. Cecil Abel came into Port Moresby and told the Allies that they might be able to build an airstrip on the far side of the Owen Stanley Range at Fasari in the Musa River valley and at Pongani. Col. Leif Sverdrup set out from Abau on foot with 190 men, including Flight Lieutenant M. J. Leahy, who had spent most of his life in New Guinea and personally knew many of the tribal chiefs. They reached Fasari on 18 October and hired local villages to clear the site by burning the bush and clearing a few stumps.50
Sverdrup and Leahy explored further north and found another suitable airstrip site near the village of Embessa and Kinjaki, which Sverdrup hired natives to clear. A message dropped by air instructed him to go to Pongani, where he found troops of Company C, 114th Engineer Battalion that had flown to Wanigela airstrip and had made their way to Pongani by travelling along the coast by boat. Sverdrup supervised the construction of Pongani airstrip. All three airstrips were soon in use.51 Sverdrup was later awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his efforts, including walking across the Owen Stanley Range three times far forward of friendly forces, and building the essential air strips.52
While the airfields were under construction, supplies were severely limited, and even food was in such short supply during November and early December that many Allied soldiers sometimes received only a small portion of a C ration each day. Mortar crews were given very limited ammo and told to ration it. However, USAAF and RAAF ground attack and bomber aircraft, typified by the Douglas A-20 Havoc and Bristol Beaufighter respectively, represented a significant and ever-increasing advantage for the Allies, although given the jungle overhead combined with poor maps, the Allies dropped bombs on their own units more than once.53
In October, the Allies captured Goodenough Island to the east of New Guinea without much Japanese resistance and began to use it as a staging point for air and naval patrols. General Kenney procured a flotilla of local water craft along with a few military ships and ferried supplies from Milne Bay around the southern end of New Guinea to Wanigela, arriving on 16 October.54
Allied forces launch attack
upright=1.4|thumb|right|Map of early operations in the battle of Buna-Gona.
On 14 October 1942, elements of 2/6th Independent Company were flown from 14-Mile Drome across the mountains to Wanigela Airfield, Wangiela.5556 From Wanigela, the company moved to Pongani. When the offensive started, the 2/6th patrolled in front of the U.S. 3rd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment along the coast from Pongani to Buna. Under the command of Major Harry Harcourt, they provided flank protection and reconnaissance and was engaged in heavy fighting around the airfield named New Strip until early December 1942.5758 Situated in the coastal area south of Cape Endaiadere, on a line running inland to Sinemi Creek, this became known as the Warren Force.59
The U.S. 32nd Infantry Division&lt;U+2014&gt;commanded by Major General Edwin F. Harding&lt;U+2014&gt;launched the initial attack on Buna on 16 November. Deployed along the Ango-Buna track, they contacted the enemy about  south of Buna. General Harding requested tanks from Milne Bay but the Allies lacked the boats required to ship them. They were later sent thinly armoured, open-top, and lightly armed Bren gun carriers, a machine gun or mortar and transport platform.60 These were rapidly knocked out by the Japanese. Tanks and artillery did not arrive until 18 December, a month after the battle began, when they made a significant impact.61
Limited artillery
Harding reluctantly accepted MacArthur's decision to rely on direct air support, and his troops were stopped cold by the formidable Japanese field fortifications.62 One battalion of the U.S. 126th Infantry Regiment, detached from the 32nd Division63 crossed the Girua River at Inonde and joined the Australian 7th Division&lt;U+2014&gt;minus one brigade&lt;U+2014&gt;under Maj. Gen. George Vasey. This group, named the Urbana Force, were charged with defending Soputa and with the subsequent attack on Sanananda.
The Gona push was reinforced by the remnants of Maroubra Force, made up of the battered 30th Brigade, a Militia unit which included the &quot;ragged bloody heroes&quot; of the Kokoda Track, the 39th Battalion.64 The Australian 16th Brigade&lt;U+2014&gt;detached from the 6th Division&lt;U+2014&gt;would push toward Sanananda.65 The Australian and U.S. forces were shifted between the Buna and Sanananda fronts, resulting in blurred lines of communication and leadership.66
By the evening of the first day, the Allied lines had barely moved. Units of the U.S. 1/126th Infantry got close enough to the Japanese positions to learn that the Japanese machine guns were positioned in bunkers reinforced with oil drums and covered with roofs.67 Fighting was bitter from the outset: the Australian 7th Division took 204 casualties in the first three days of its thrust.
Each Japanese bunker contained several well-concealed machine guns. At times, the jungle was so dense that the Allied troops could not tell from which direction the Japanese were firing.68 Japanese snipers tied themselves to the tops of coconut trees and picked off targets. The 32d Division was the first American unit during the war to encounter this type of defense.
Morale low
By the time the Allied advance on Buna had stalled in late November, morale was low due to heavy casualties and disease. Self-inflicted wounds were increasingly responsible for American casualties.6970
The Japanese were bombarded by air and artillery all day. To avoid revealing their positions, they refused to fire at attacking aircraft. Like the Allied troops, their foxholes and even their bunkers were flooded. Under constant attack and subject to ongoing, unremitting rain, it was hard for them to get much sleep. They could not leave their positions. A Japanese officer described in his diary watching several men go mad &quot;before my eyes&quot; due to the constant pounding. Another officer expressed his regret at the &quot;wretched sight&quot; of casualties who had to prop themselves upright to avoid drowning in their bedrolls.71 A Japanese machine-gunner hastily scribbled in his diary on 17 November: &quot;Our food is completely gone. We are eating tree bark and grass.&quot; On 19 November, he wrote, &quot;In other units there are men eating the flesh of dead Australians. There is nothing to eat.&quot; During December, supplies to the Japanese forces were reduced further, and the isolated forces subsisted on a half-pint of rice per day.72
An average of 20 Japanese troops died of illness every day. A Tokyo staff officer commented, &quot;Even regimental and battalion commanders do not play their proper roles and lack spirited morale.&quot; Like the Allied troops, the soldiers were sick with malaria and other jungle diseases. Some were virtually comatose in their foxholes, but the remaining Japanese stubbornly clung to their defenses.73
Advance on Buna Village
  There were about 5,500 Japanese army and navy troops in and around Buna. Opposite the 126th Infantry was the Yokosuka 5th Special Naval Landing Force, composed of about 400 tough naval infantrymen with an additional 600 naval construction troops. As recently as 17 November, Japanese destroyers had delivered 2,300 troops fresh from Rabaul, New Britain. These included the veteran 3rd Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment, 38th Division, which had fought in China, Hong Kong and Java.74
On 20 November, MacArthur&lt;U+2014&gt;operating from his comfortable headquarters in Port Moresby&lt;U+2014&gt;ordered Harding to attack &quot;regardless of losses&quot;. The following day, he sent another missive to Harding, telling him to &quot;take Buna today at all costs&quot;. General Edmund Herring arrived at the American front on 25 November and reported that the American infantry had &quot;maintained a masterly inactivity at Buna&quot;.
When MacArthur offered the 41st American Division as reinforcements for the advance on Gona, Australian General Thomas Blamey declined. This was later seen as payback for earlier statements by MacArthur about the fighting ability of Australian troops. Blamey stated he would rely on his depleted 21st Brigade as he &quot;knew they would fight&quot;.75
On 19 November, Blamey sent a communication through MacArthur and tried to persuade Admiral Arthur S. Carpender&lt;U+2014&gt;who controlled U.S. Navy vessels&lt;U+2014&gt;to provide support.
Carpender would not commit destroyers to the mission and gave the lack of charts for the area as the reason. With the only artillery support provided by a single 25 pounder battery with 200 rounds of ammunition, the 32nd Division began its attack on 19 November and was immediately met by strong resistance from well-entrenched and camouflaged Japanese positions manned by fresh soldiers. During their initial assault, the Americans were met by heavy machine gun and rifle fire. Near the Duropa Plantation, the 1/128 found that due to the dense jungle growth, they could not identify the position of the hidden enemy machine gun positions and were uncertain where to fire. The Japanese weapons gave off no flash, and the jungle concealed the reverberation of their fire. The heavy jungle canopy also made it difficult for them to fire their mortars or use their grenades effectively.76 Veterans of the battle said later that their field of vision was very limited, from , and they couldn't be certain of which direction the enemy was firing from.77 Despite the lack of progress made by U.S. and Australian forces, naval support remained unavailable.
On the trail junction between the old and new airstrips, the Simemi Trail narrowed into a path with swamp on either side. At the trail junction between the air strips, the 3/128 were met with intense fire from three directions. The battalion could not use their mortars which had been left behind in Port Moresby. They discovered that most of their machine gun cartridges were the wrong type and that a large number of their grenades failed to detonate. They quickly ran out of .30-caliber ammunition and failed to advance the first day.78 On the next day, the 1/128th advanced a mere 200 yards; the 3/128th made no progress. When the Americans saw the few Japanese killed, they were surprised to see the men were robust and well-fed and not in the emaciated, weak state they had been led to believe. Late on the 20th, the 1/126th, who had been flown across the Owen Stanley Mountains, completed a difficult trek from Pongani, arrived to reinforce the attacking force.79
On the 21st, the 126th Infantry was detached from General Harding's organisation and reassigned to the Australian 7th Division across the Girua River. Harding objected to the splitting of his forces and was overruled. A scheduled attack at 0800 was aborted when the commanding officers didn't get word until after the attack was set to begin. Aircraft assigned to support the assault missed some of their targets, wounding soldiers in the 3/128th. Harding reset the attack to 1300 but the air cover promised didn't arrive until 1400. Most of the planes could not find the target area while one B-25 dropped its bomb load on Companies B and C of the 128th, wounding several men, hurting the group's morale and will to fight. The subsequent attack by the Americans, armed only with rifles, Thompson submachine guns, light machine guns, and hand grenades, was easily stopped by the Japanese.80 Company C of the 128th lost 63 men including all four of its officers in the first three days of combat.81
Short of men, Harding committed his reserve force, the 2/128th to replace the detached 126th and reinforce the left side. As it tried to advance, it too was hit by heavy machine gun fire from concealed positions and was soon thrown back. Flanking the Japanese meant crawling through the swamps, unable to see more than a few yards in any direction. The division repeatedly failed to make any progress against the Japanese positions, and a stalemate ensued. The Japanese had occupied and fortified all of the high ground, and some of the Americans were in swamps for three to four days at a time. They built foxholes, but they filled with water up to their knees, and the GIs slept in them, ate in them, and relieved themselves in them because they had nowhere else to go.82 General Harding, despite having been told not to ask, requested return of at least one of his battalions. The 2/126, the &quot;Ghost Battalion&quot;, was sent back across the Girua River but was delayed by the high flood waters. They finally returned late on 22 November. Harding requested some light tanks from the Australians, but the captured barges used to transport them sank under the weight of the tanks.83
MacArthur was frustrated by Maj. Gen. Harding's lack of progress. Late on 22 November, MacArthur&lt;U+2019&gt;s headquarters sent an order to Harding to attack the next day regardless of cost. Harding was convinced that his commanding officers could not know the strength of the defending Japanese. He felt that if he strictly obeyed the order, his entire force on the right flank could be destroyed. Harding relayed the order in its entirety to General MacNider, but modified it. He told MacNider to put everything he had available and to press the attack, but that if it became evident that they could not progress and further action would result in needless casualties, to call off the advance. Harding took the extra step of telling MacNider that he assumed full responsibility for modifying MacArthur's order.84 The attack made some progress but was finally halted by the Japanese.
By 23 November, it was obvious that capturing Gona was unlikely due to a lack of Allied troops and insufficient tank and artillery support. Without support from tanks that could have taken out a strongpoint in minutes, the Japanese positions were very difficult to defeat and had to be taken one by one, which required troops crawling through murderous cross-fire and snipers to the bunkers and pushing grenades through the slits.85 General Vasey requested that Lieutenant General Edmund Herring send the 21st Brigade as reinforcements. The 32nd Division had only two M101 howitzers belonging to Battery A of the 129th Field Artillery in New Guinea, the remaining batteries having been left at Camp Cable in Australia due to a lack of transport. The four gun sections of Battery A were the first howitzers flown into combat, first landing at Port Moresby. Then, &lt;U+00BD&gt; of Battery A&lt;U+2014&gt;two gun sections&lt;U+2014&gt;were air-lifted over the Owen Stanley Mountains to Buna and reassembled, becoming the first U.S. Army artillery flown into combat in the Pacific in World War II.86
 When additional artillery finally arrived on 26 November, the accuracy of artillery fire was limited by poor maps and the inability of the forward artillery observer's to see far enough through the dense jungle. On that morning, the Japanese lines were strafed and bombed at tree-top level for nearly an hour by Curtiss P-40s and Beaufighters. Douglas A-20s bombed the Japanese rear areas for another 30 minutes. The air attacks were then followed by 30 minutes of pounding by mortars, machine guns, and the newly available artillery. At 9:30, the infantry advanced as scheduled, but it immediately became apparent that the two hours of bombardment had not touched the enemy, still hidden in their bunkers.87
The Allies made preparation for another offensive operation on 26 November, Thanksgiving Day. The attack was prepared with air, artillery, mortar and heavy machine gun fire, but it had little affect on the well-emplaced Japanese. Harding came well forward to observe and watched as the 3/128th ran into fierce resistance.88
Finally, the Cannon and Anti-tank Companies of the 126th arrived on 27 November and were put to use supporting the remaining two battalions of the 126th and the 7th Australian. They made some progress, but supply problems contributed to delays and lack of progress. Only one supply boat was operational to get supplies from the Dobodura air strip, and natives were recruited, but they would not advance to the front lines.89
On 29 November, the Japanese were reinforced by the remaining 500 troops from the South Seas Detachment (mostly the 41st Infantry Regiment under Colonel Kiyomi Yazawa), which had led the Kokoda Track campaign and retreated to the sea at a point north of Gona. They were shuttled by boat to the Sananada stronghold.

By 29 November, the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific, General Douglas MacArthur, had become frustrated at what he saw as poor performance by the 32nd Division, especially its commissioned officers. He told the US I Corps commander, Major General Robert L. Eichelberger:
Brigadier Generals Hanford MacNider, Albert W. Waldron, and Clovis E. Byers recuperate in hospital in Australia after being wounded in the Battle of Buna-Gona.
On 30 November, the 2/126th became the first to significantly penetrate the enemy lines at Buna, successfully pushing the Japanese back several hundred metres.90 On 1 December, Harding directed attacks on both the Urbana and the Warren front. On the Urbana front, Company E of the 126th, reinforced by the headquarters companies of both battalions, was able with support from the available 25-pounder artillery piece and mortar support to advance across an open area below the bridge over the Girua River, but then inexplicably withdrew, perhaps due to a communications problem. E and F Companies from the 126th, along with a platoon from the 128th, resumed the attack on 2 December, but were stopped by heavy machine gun fire from every direction they approached. A visiting medical officer reported that the men looked like &quot;Christ of the Cross.&quot;91 These and other reports did not mollify Eichelberger's view of the situation. Eichelberger arrived in Buna to inspect the troops on 2 December.
On the Warren front, the attack on 2 December began with an air attack, but a planned artillery barrage was late. When the infantry finally advanced, they were stopped once again by the Japanese without significant gains. Many troops dropped from heat exhaustion.92
With the 32nd Division failing to advance in keeping with MacArthur's expectations, MacArthur sent two staff officers&lt;U+2014&gt;Col. Clarance Martin and Col. Gordon Rogers&lt;U+2014&gt;to evaluate the situation on the Warren front. They arrived in midafternoon after the conclusion of an intense battle which had put all available reserves on the line. Martin could not understand why the men were not pushing forward. They questioned whether there had been any fighting at all.93 They found the troops were ill with malaria, dengue fever, tropical dysentery, and other ailments. They discovered the men had few rations causing them to lose weight, and lacked hot meals, vitamins, and cigarettes. Some were unshaven, their uniforms and boots were dirty and in tatters, and they showed &quot;little discipline or military courtesy.&quot;94 Without fresh clothing, walking through swamps, and lacking sanitation, many were afflicted with trench foot.95 Having been on the front at Buna for two weeks with virtually no progress to show for it except for hundreds of casualties, the U.S. troops' morale was very poor.96
Accompanied by Harding and Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron, Eichelberger inspected the Urbana front after the combat action for the day had played itself out. When they stopped to visit an aid station, Eichelberger saw among the casualties unwounded men who were sick with fever and exhaustion and a few with combat fatigue. Eichelberger was further upset when he learned that day's attack had failed. They walked forward, and when he was not fired on by the Japanese concluded that the U.S. troops faced little opposition. He was disturbed when he found there wasn't a continuous front and criticised the placement of a machine gun, seeing this as proof the men were not pressing a weak enemy. He queried troops about where a path led and was told it was covered by a Japanese machine gun. He offered to decorate any man who would run  down the path. No one took him up on his offer, and he decided they were cowards.97
Eichelberger vented his anger on Major Mott and Smith, pointing out the unwounded men in the aid station and the machine gunner's hesitance. Mott vehemently exploded, pointed out the suffering and bravery of his men. Harding angrily threw his cigarette on the ground, agreeing with Mott. Eichelberger responded, &quot;You're licked.&quot;98
Martin and Rogers returned from the Warren front to the 32nd Division headquarters at Dobodura at 22:00 to find that Eichelberger had already relieved Harding of command. Eichelberger replaced him with the division's artillery commander, General Waldron. Eichelberger also sacked the regimental commanders and most battalion commanders, ordered improved food and medical supplies, and halted operations on the Buna front for two days, to allow units to reorganise.99
Eichelberger later noted that after he relieved Harding he &quot;ordered the medicos to take the temperature of an entire company of hollow-eyed men near the front. Every member, I repeat, every member of that company was running a fever.&quot;100 Eichelberger found the men lacked even the oil and patches required to keep their guns free of rust. He put an officer in charge of supply who ignored all protocols to obtain whatever the men needed. Eichelberger conspicuously wore his three stars on his shoulders among the front-line troops, ignoring the rule that officers remove their insignia at the front because they will attract the enemy. He lost thirty pounds in thirty days at the front.101
Martin later admitted, after some experience with the Japanese defences, that had attacks been continued on the day he conducted his inspection, they would not have been successful.102
Allied reconnaissance
Eichelberger also ordered additional reconnaissance to help fix the enemy positions. What he learned impressed him.
On the same day, 500 Japanese reinforcements, in the form of the inexperienced 21st Independent Mixed Brigade (based on the 170th Infantry Regiment), arrived at Gona under Maj. Gen. Kurihanao Yamagata. The Japanese fought tenaciously and the 32nd Division lost 392 personnel within the first two weeks.
Attack reinitiated
Brig. Gen. Clovis E. Byers. He became commander of the 32nd Division after Harding was relieved of command, and following Brig. Gen. Albert W. Waldron who was wounded by a sniper.
On 5 December, Eichelberger ordered an attack across the entire front. Waldron was shot in the shoulder by a sniper while observing the fighting, and Eichelberger replaced him with his Chief of Staff, Brig. Gen. Clovis E. Byers. Eichelberger moved the I Corps command to the Buna area, running his HQ with a batman and radio operator. &quot;Some of the 32nd's officers privately denounced Eichelberger as ruthless, Prussian. The men of the 32nd...called their division cemetery 'Eichelberger Square.'&quot;103
Japanese lines split
On the same day, the Allies split the Japanese lines. Staff Sergeant Herman Bottcher, Platoon Commander G Company, 126th Infantry, led 18 men against the defending and heavily entrenched Japanese forces. He stood up and threw hand grenades at the enemy in their emplacements and was able to drive a wedge between the Japanese positions in Buna and Buna village. Forty Japanese soldiers were killed on the beach; a dozen were wounded. Sergeant Bottcher and his troops fought off attacks for seven days, taking over enemy machine guns for their own use. Bottcher was wounded twice before he was relieved.104
Australian war correspondent George Johnston wrote in Time magazine on September 20, 1943: 
Bottcher had finally turned the tide of the battle at Buna. His platoon's efforts cut off the Japanese in Buna Village from resupply and reinforcements, enabling the rest of the division to take the village. Bottcher was awarded the battlefield commission of captain and his first of two Distinguished Service Cross Medals. A plaque was later placed at the entrance to Buna Village in memory of his actions that day.105
Gona village captured
 On 8 December, following savage close-quarter fighting, the Australians captured Gona village.106 That same day, Eichelberger organised a new attack on Buna Village and the 32nd Division captured the position on 14 December.107 General Clovis Byers was in turn wounded on 16 December, forcing Eichelberger to take direct command of the division. The Japanese landed 1,300 reinforcements, but by 18 December the Allies were reinforced by the Australian 7th Division's 18th Brigade along with the M3 Stuart light tanks of the 2/6th Armoured Regiment108&lt;U+2014&gt;the first tanks available to the Allied forces. In spite of this boost, the Australians suffered some of their worst losses of the entire battle, although they eventually broke through the Japanese defensive positions along the coast.
Buna Mission overtaken
Japanese soldiers killed during the final phase of the battle at Buna Mission, January 1943.
In 10 days of fighting, the 32nd Division, reinforced by the 18th Brigade and finally assisted by tanks, advanced along the coast from Duropa plantation to Buna Mission, taking the remaining Japanese positions on 2 January 1943.109 In the Japanese positions they located the bodies of Allied soldiers who had been captured and found evidence of cannibalism. During the prior attempt to capture Port Moresby over the Kokoda Track, and during their defense of Buna-Gona, the Japanese regularly practiced cannibalism.110111. None of the Allied soldiers taken captive during the entire Kokoda Track campaign and the fight for Buna-Gona were allowed to live, and a number of those who were captured had been tortured, eaten, or used for bayonet practice.112
Battle for Sanananda
The battle of Sanananda was the longest of the three battles. The Japanese position was well-defended, astride a raised road on relatively dry ground, surrounded by waist-deep jungle swamp. In an attempt to cut off the forward Japanese positions, the elements of 3rd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment flanked the Japanese road block and capture the road behind them. Although they were successful in establishing the roadblock, the Japanese maintained their position, receiving resupply through the swamp.
The Australian 16th Brigade&lt;U+2014&gt;by now half-strength&lt;U+2014&gt;was sent to attack the position, but their march was poorly organised. From 16 November to their first contact with the enemy on 19 November, the troops went without food. The 1,400 men of 126th Infantry regiment were ordered to report to the Australians but did not arrive until 21 November, by which time the Australians had suffered more than 30% casualties. On 7 December, the Australian 30th Brigade relieved the 16th Brigade, and Brigadier Porter took overall command.113 The 126th was also relieved but 635 troops manned a roadblock under constant Japanese attack. The remainder of the 2/6th was withdrawn to Soputa and then Port Moresby, where they spent Christmas prior to returning to Australia for re-organization and refurbishment.114115
right|thumb|upright=1.4|Sanananda Front, 22 November 1942 &lt;U+2013&gt; 22 January 1943 The Americans received their first reinforcements on 18 December when 350 men from the Australian 2/7th Cavalry Regiment fought their way through to the roadblock. The following day, the 2/7th outflanked the Japanese and established another roadblock  ahead of the American position and the Australian 49th Battalion now reinforced the 126th.116 By now, illness and low morale was taking its toll and the 126th were retired on 22 December.
On 25 December, eight companies of the 127th Infantry followed a large artillery and mortar barrage and attacked the Japanese position in the &quot;Government Gardens&quot; section of Buna. The commanding officer of Company C was killed. Eichelberger later wrote that &quot;the fighting was desperate and the outcome of the whole miserable, tortured campaign was in doubt&quot;.117 Having never visited the front, MacArthur sent his Chief of Staff&lt;U+2014&gt;Richard K. Sutherland&lt;U+2014&gt;with a letter for Eichelberger which Sutherland delivered on Christmas Day.118
Eichelberger wrote back that he was pushing the offensive with the kinds of numbers he felt the situation warranted. He reassured MacArthur that his men were fighting hard. On 28 December, he received a communique from MacArthur that he had released to the press describing the action at Buna Gona. It read, &quot;On Christmas Day, our activities were limited to routine safety precautions. Divine services were held.&quot; It left Eichelberger fuming.119120
On the night of 25 December, a Japanese submarine unloaded supplies and ammunition at Buna Government Station, the last time the Japanese received supplies.121
Of the 635 American troops who engaged the Japanese, only 244 effective troops remained by the end of December.
Allies attack Japanese-held junction
On 2 January, the U.S. 163rd Infantry Regiment of the 41st Infantry Division&lt;U+2014&gt;fresh from Australia&lt;U+2014&gt;arrived and took over the two roadblocks and relieved the Australians.122 
The preliminary attacks began with a failed attack on the Japanese position between the two roadblocks on 8 January.123 Two days later, the Allies supported by tanks attacked the Japanese position at the trail junction. The attack failed but convinced Col. Tsukamoto to order a retreat. Japanese Imperial Headquarters had already decided on 4 January to retreat to Lae and Salamaua, but the order did not reach Sanananda until 12 January.124 On 14 January, the Allies discovered that most of the Japanese defenders had left and quickly overran the junction stronghold now held by only 158 Japanese.
15 January saw the U.S. 163rd Infantry finally broke the Japanese position between the road blocks. The main attack began the next day with the 163rd attacking the Japanese troops north of the two roadblocks while the Australian 18th Brigade's attack reached the coast on both sides of Sanananda and also supported the American attack, effecting a link-up at Huggins and on the Killerton Track.125 Japanese resistance was stiff; nevertheless, by 17 January, they had been pinned down in three positions, on the coast north of Sanananda, on the coast west of Giruwa and on the main track north of the roadblocks which was still holding out. On 20 January, General Yamagata ordered an evacuation and escaped while General Oda and Colonel Yazawa ran into Australian troops and were killed; the Japanese positions on the coast collapsed with little resistance. Evacuation of the main track was not possible and this last position was overrun on 22 January.126
Aftermath
After almost three months of fighting, of the 16,000 Japanese who had been landed on New Guinea, an estimated 6,500 were defending Buna-Gona. The Japanese forces had been cut off from resupply during the second week of January and their food had already run out by 2 January. Allied troops found evidence of cannibalism of both Japanese and Allied soldiers in captured Japanese positions.127128129 When the fighting ended, only six Japanese were captured. The remainder of the garrison had escaped northward into the jungle or were annihilated.130
On 20 November, MacArthur had ordered Harding to attack &quot;regardless of losses&quot;. Two days later he sent an order to Harding to attack the next day regardless of cost. After Harding was relieved of command, MacArthur constantly pressured Eichelberger to act quickly and obtain results. Eichelberger recorded multiple instances when MacArthur urged him to hasten his efforts to rapidly defeat the Japanese. In contrast, he publicly stated after the campaign's conclusion that, &quot;There was no reason to hurry the attack because the time element was of little importance.&quot;131 He said, &quot;The utmost care was taken for the conservation of our forces with the result that probably no campaign in history against a thoroughly prepared and trained Army produced such complete and decisive results with so low an expenditure of life and resources.&quot;132
Allied casualty rate exceeds Guadalcanal
The Australians lost 2,700 and the Americans 798 at Buna-Gona.133 On 14 October 1942, 9,825 men of the32nd Division entered combat. During less than seven weeks in New Guinea, it suffered 586 killed, 1,954 wounded, and 100 more dead from other causes.134 Tropical diseases&lt;U+2014&gt;especially malaria, dengue fever and bush typhus (known to the Japanese as tsutsugamushi)&lt;U+2014&gt;caused far more casualties than the effects of battle. The division suffered an extraordinary 66% illness rate, with 7,125 casualties due to illness (with 2,952 requiring hospitalisation). Total casualties of 9,956 exceeded the Division's entire battle strength.135136
 Among the 126th Infantry Regiment, whose 2nd Battalion had marched over the Kapa Kapa Trail only six weeks earlier, the percentage of losses was even higher. When the troops arrived in the Buna area had gone into action during on 21 November, they including 1,400 troops in their ranks. When they were relieved by the Australian 2nd Division 7 Cavalry on 9 January, only 165 men remained, the majority of them scarcely able to walk.137
Overall, about 60,000 Americans fought on Guadalcanal, suffering 5,845 casualties, including 1,600 killed in action. On Papua more than 33,000 Americans and Australians fought, and they suffered 8,546 casualties, of whom 3,095 were killed. On Guadalcanal, one in 37 died, while troops in New Guinea had a one in 11 chance of dying.138
In his book, Our Jungle Road to Tokyo written in 1950, Eichelberger wrote, &quot;Buna was...bought at a substantial price in death, wounds, disease, despair,and human suffering. No one who fought there, however hard he tries, will ever forget it.&quot; Fatalities, he concluded, &quot;closely approach, percentage-wise, the heaviest losses in our Civil War battles.&quot; He also commented, &quot;I am a reasonably unimaginative man, but Buna is still to me, in retrospect, a nightmare. This long after, I can still remember every day and most of the nights.&quot;139
Historian Stanley Falk agreed. &quot;The Papuan campaign was one of the costliest Allied victories of the Pacific war in terms of casualties per troops committed.&quot;140 The Ghost Mountain Boys of the 2/126th were especially hard hit. When Buna was taken they finished the fight with only six officers and 126 troops standing out of the 900 plus who had started out from Kapa Kapa.141
The march by the U.S. 2/126th from Kapa Kapa to Jaure and the brutal combat at Buna-Gona taught the Allied armies important lessons that they applied throughout the Pacific Theater and remainder of the war in the Pacific.142
