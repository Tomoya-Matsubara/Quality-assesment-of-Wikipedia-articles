Arise is the fourth studio album by Brazillian thrash metal band Sepultura, released in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. It is considered a landmark in both the thrash and death metal genres: and Allmusic contributor Eduardo Rivadavia declared it &quot;a classic of the death metal genre.&quot;1 It is also considered their finest hour among longtime fans.2
The Arise tour (1990-1992) has been the group's longest yet, totalling 220 shows in 39 different countries.3 During this trek Arise went gold in Indonesia, making it their first music industry certification ever.4 By the tour's end, Arise had achieved platinum sales worldwide.5
Production
In August 1990, the band travelled to Florida, USA to work on Arise. Scott Burns reprised his role as their producer and engineer, and now with a major advantage: Sepultura were at his home base, Morrisound, a studio properly equipped to record their music style. Their label Roadrunner granted a $40,000 budget, which helped explain the album's improved production values. That allowed Igor and Burns, for example, a whole week to spend just testing the drum kit's tunings and the proper microphone practice to record it.6
Musical style
Although lead guitarrist Andreas Kisser stated that Arise &quot;took a lot of the same direction&quot; as their previous LP, Beneath the Remains, it was clear that their music had somehow changed.7 Sepultura's usual breakneck pace became toned down a bit;8 drummer Igor Cavalera started using groove-laden rhythms; and the Max Cavalera/Kisser guitar duo experiment with different tunings on some songs. According to metal specialist Don Kaye, Arise &quot;represented the band taking their initial death/thrash sound to its logical conclusion.&quot;9
Arise also found the band opening up to non-metal influences.10 The Young Gods, Ministry and Einst&lt;U+00FC&gt;rzende Neubauten were already part of Sepultura's listening habits, and slight touches of industrial music can be traced through the use of samples and sound effects.11 A trademark of a later phase—Latin percussion and &quot;tribal&quot; drumming—made its point of entry on the song &quot;Altered State&quot;. The band's old love for hardcore punk started shining through on &quot;Subtraction&quot; and &quot;Desperate Cry&quot;.12
Touring and promotion
One day after finishing the recording of Arise, the band did a small headlining tour with extreme metallers Obituary and Sadus.13 That was the start of the longest promotional tour of Sepultura's career, a worldwide affair that would span to two full years.14 In January 1991 they were invited to play for the Rio de Janeiro, Brazil music festival Rock in Rio 2.15 Their performance was watched by a 70,000-strong crowd.16
Before heading out of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura performed one more concert at S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, the country's largest city. It took place at Pra&lt;U+00E7&gt;a Charles Miller (in front of Est&lt;U+00E1&gt;dio do Pacaembu), on May 11th.17 Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was shot dead. A week before, a young man was stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in S&lt;U+00E3&gt;o Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads.18 These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.19
Sepultura's three-month tour with thrash metal grups Sacred Reich and Heathen was a critical success. For the first time ever they became the cover story of best-selling British heavy metal magazine Kerrang! and major pop music weeklies such as Melody Maker and NME published long feature articles on the group. While in Spain Sepultura recorded their Under Siege video, which included their Barcelona concert and interview footage with all four members of the band.20 After Europe, they toured North America with grindcore pioneers Napalm Death, NYC hardcore punk group Sick of It All and Sacred Reich.21 Sepultura wrapped up the year doing a brief German tour with NWOBHM legends M&lt;U+00F6&gt;torhead and Florida death metal group Morbid Angel in December.22
A remastered version of Arise was released by Roadrunner in 1997, with added notes by music critic Don Kaye and four bonus tracks: a cover version of Mot&lt;U+00F6&gt;rhead's &quot;Orgasmatron&quot;, two previously unreleased songs and a rough mix of &quot;Desperate Cry&quot;.23 Previously unavailable photos from the Arise era were also included in the expanded CD booklet.24
Chart performance
Arise was the first Sepultura record to enter the Billboard charts, at number 119.25 It was also the first to gain a music certification—Arise went gold in 1992 for selling 25,000 copies in Indonesia.26 By the 1993 the album had sold 1 million units around the globe.27 In 2001 it won
a second certification: silver in the United Kingdom, for selling an excess of 60,000 copies.28
Track listing
Track 10 was both a bonus track for the Brazilian release and a b-side of the Dead Embryonic Cells single. Tracks 11&lt;U+2013&gt;13 are only available on the 1997 remastered re-release.
