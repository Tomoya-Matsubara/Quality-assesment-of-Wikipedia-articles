I Look to You is the seventh studio album by American R&amp;B and pop singer Whitney Houston, released August 28, 2009 on Sony Music in Europe,1 August 31, 2009 on Arista Records in the United States, and October 19, 2009 on RCA Records in the United Kingdom.23 I Look to You serves as Houston's first studio album since Just Whitney (2002).4 It was announced in March 2007 by Clive Davis (head of Arista Records), that she would be recording the album. By that date, it was set to be released in the rest of North America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America.
The album contains a mixture of R&amp;B, big ballads, and dance music.5 According to Davis, I Look to You is aiming not to simply follow current music marketing trends, but instead, stay true to who Houston is and the impact she has made on the music industry.6 The roster of producers and writers include Swizz Beatz, Johnta Austin, Alicia Keys, R. Kelly, Harvey Mason, Jr., and Akon, who is the only guest vocalist on the album. Upon its release, I Look to You received generally favorable reviews from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 71/100 from Metacritic.7
Background
I Look to You had been in production for about three and a half years as stated by Whitney Houston herself during her Los Angeles album listening party in 2009.8 Recording sessions for the album took place at various studios, including Germano Studios, Roc the Mic Studios, and Oven Studios in New York City, Soapbox West Studios 1221 Studios, and Chalice Studios in San Francisco, California, Patchwerk Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Hit Factory Criteria in Miami, Florida, Mason Sound in North Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, Illinois, The Boom Boom Room in Burbank, California, Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Tree Sound Studios in Norcross, Georgia.9 Rumor of Houston's return to music were first circulated at the start of 2007 and were then substantiated when Clive Davis confirmed that he would personally be involved in the project in an interview on the Oprah Winfrey Show. In February 2009, Houston made her official public comeback at Clive Davis's &quot;Pre-Grammy Gala&quot;, her first major live appearance since 2004.10 Houston performed a four-song set and despite Clive Davis stating she would perform tracks from her upcoming album I Look To You, she belted out her classic hits, &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, &quot;I Believe In You And Me&quot;, &quot;It's Not Right But It's Okay&quot; and closing the set with a rousing version of &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot;. Onlookers included her mother Cissy Houston, Paul McCartney, Jamie Foxx, Antonio Banderas, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Hudson, Faith Evans, Fantasia and Barry Manilow.11
Speaking about why the album has been named after the song &quot;I Look to You&quot; Houston said: &quot;The last several years spiritually, this song says all I wanted to say. There are times in life when we go through certain situations - some not so good. You have to reach for a higher strength, you have to reach deep inside yourself, spend time with yourself to make some corrections that go beyond your own understanding and lean on a higher understanding, for me [this] song puts it all in check. If I did not have my faith I wouldn't be as strong today.12 Additionally she told press in London that her latest album will reflect her emotional state and chronicle events in her personal life since her last musical release in 2002. She said &quot;That makes it real. The changes that we go through, the transitions that we go through, the tests that we go through, being a mother, becoming a single mother. It all had its ups and its downs, but for the most part, I kept my faith and I kept my head up... I took my time. All the triumphs and the ups and downs and stuff, it's all incorporated on the album, and hopefully not only does it inspire me, but inspires a whole lot of other people.&quot; 13
Music
The first song and a future single is called &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; and was written by Alicia Keys after the singer-songwriter personally asked Davis if she could make a contribution to the album.14 The song was produced by rapper Swizz Beatz but critics commented that it does not sound like a typical &quot;Swizzy&quot; production; it's more old-school R&amp;B but definitely is not an attempt to create a club banger.15 Right from the start, it displays Houston's voice over a club-friendly beat that blends a rough-riding thump with R&amp;B.16 &quot;Nothin' But Love&quot; was produced by contemporary R&amp;B and hip-hop producer Nathaniel &quot;Danja&quot; Hills and is described as an uptempo, danceable, hand-clapping beat. Critics have cited that Houston's vocals are on prominent display as she belts out several long runs. The song is very radio friendly.17 &quot;Call You Tonight&quot; is one of two songs written by Johnta Austin. It was a contender for the lead single and was produced by Norweigen production team Stargate featuring their trademark guitar riffs. The other Austin track on the album entitled &quot;Worth it&quot; was produced by Eric Hudson and is a R&amp;B mid-tempo number.18 &quot;I Didn't Know My Own Strength&quot;, penned by Diane Warren and produced with David Foster, shows Houston's triumph in the face of adversity. Warren told Vibe magazine that she had penned the track especially for Houston.19 Davis told Warren, that she had &quot;written one of her great copyrights.&quot; 20
In the Summer 2009 edition of Rap-Up magazine Akon spoke about working with Houston for her upcoming album. In the interview he called her &quot;down to earth&quot; as well as revealing that he had worked with her on two songs for the album one of which &quot;Like I Never Left&quot; was previously leaked to the Internet. Akon commented that it was officially supposed to be a single.21 In its unfinished form it didn't muster well with critics who felt that it was not a direction that Houston should go in. However the new version that was played at the album parties was more complete with added bass. Davis said Houston wanted an island song, so they reached out to Akon.It is cited as being a real grower.22 R Kelly contributed two songs to the album the first being &quot;Salute&quot;. It is a conceptual song in that it is militaristic, with its marching beat. and R Kelly has his vocals featured (&quot;Eh eh eh&quot;). Houston uses the song to give a clear message particularly clear in the line &quot;Don&lt;U+2019&gt;t call it a comeback, I&lt;U+2019&gt;ve been here for years.&quot; The other song &quot;I Look to You&quot; is central to the album and became the title too because of its deep meaning. Houston says that the powerful piano ballad that sums up the album and is all she wants to say at this stage of her life.23 &quot;A Song for You&quot; is a cover of the 1970s song of the same name by Leon Russell however it was unexpected, starting off slow with a piano intro, then speeds up towards the middle before its climax at the end.24
Release and promotion
On July 14, 2009 Houston travelled to Knightsbridge in London, England for an official album listening party. The evening was hosted at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel by Sony Music chief creative executive Clive Davis.25 In total nine songs were premiered including &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot;, &quot;Nothin' But Love&quot;, &quot;I Didn't Know My Own Strength&quot;, &quot;Like I Never Left&quot; (featuring Akon), &quot;For the Lovers&quot;, &quot;I Look to You&quot;, &quot;Worth It&quot; and a cover of Donny Hathaway's &quot;A Song for You&quot;.26 &quot;Call You Tonight&quot; (produced and demo by Johnt&lt;U+00E1&gt; Austin) was also played and cited as a likely lead single. Davis pointed out that &quot;we didn't try to fit Whitney into the market&quot; and much of the songs were still unfinished. The album was yet to be mastered and mixed.27 On July 21, 2009, Houston hosted a listening party with Clive Davis in New York City. Amongst those in attendance were Clive Davis, Alicia Keys, Kaseem &quot;Swizz Beatz&quot; Dean, Cissy Houston, Dionne Warwick, Martha Stewart, Steve Harvey, Vivica Fox and many representatives from the American press. The preview of the album triggered a standing ovation especially when &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; was played. The song written by Keys and produced by Swizz Beatz was amongst the songs which received critical acclaim 28 Finally on July 23, 2009 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Bevery Hills, LA the final star-studded listening party took place. The evening was attended by Halle Berry, Jane Fonda, Stevie Wonder, Magic Johnson, Jackie Collins, Barry Manilow, Brett Ratner, Beverly Johnson, Diane Warren, Penny Marshall, Brian McKnight, David Foster amongst others. Again the album was played almost in its entirely. The title track &quot;I Look to You&quot; garnered a standing ovation.29
At the beginning of July 2009, the album was slated for September 1 release in the United States as noted at the official album parties, on Houston's official website and also by the official press release.3031 However under these circumstances the album would not be eligible for the Grammy nominations for 2009&lt;U+2013&gt;2010 as the cut-off date for entries is August 31, 2009. Therefore on July 28, 2009, Houston's official website announced that the US release date would be moved to August 31, 2009 which would make the album eligible.32 On July 23, 2009, selected US radio stations exclusively premiered the title track &quot;I Look to You&quot;. It received a promotional release to US radio on July 27, 200933 and until July 31, 2009 the single was available to download from Houston's website exclusively in the US, Canada, Austria, Spain, Sweden, Germany and Italy.34 Upon its release it became Houston's first top 20 hit on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs Chart in nearly a decade;35 it will be fully released to US radio on August 11, 2009. The song will be released in the UK on August 31, 2009 as opposed to the original plan to release the album on this date.36 It is a promotional single to create a buzz for the album and hence has no video or cover art.
There have been further changes to the availability of the album in the UK as well; although initially set for an August 31, 2009 release, the album will now be released on October 19, 2009.37 Due to deadlines and US promotion schedules Houston would have been unable to release and promote the lead single &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; before the album's release in the UK. &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; was confirmed by Houston's website to be the official lead single and will be released to U.S. radio on August 18, 2009.38 It will be released as a digital download in the UK on August 24, 2009.39 It is being prepped for a worldwide release with a video expected to follow shortly. Houston's performance on Good Morning America's 'Fall Concerts' series on the American television broadcast network ABC aired on September 02, 2009. She performed songs from this album, including single &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; and title song &quot;I Look to You&quot;, as well as previous hits &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; and &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;.
Reception
Critical response
Initial critical response to I Look to You was generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an aggregate score of 71/100 based on eight reviews.40 Most reviews have praised the selection of songs but noted that Houston's voice has changed, becoming deeper and huskier.41 Many critics highlighted the decline in Houston's vocal prowess, and cited it as one of the major weaknesses of the album. Vibe magazine commented, &quot;Whitney, who at one point could blow the roof off of a stadium with her powerhouse vocals, can no longer crack the ceiling of a high school gym. Those looking for vintage Houston would be better served purchasing a greatest hits record. I Look To You is underwhelming. It's not bad. It's just good. Come Grammy night, Houston will leave just as she came.&quot;42 Slant Magazine critic Sal Cinquemani also wrote &quot;I Look to You finds Whitney struggling to hit notes and deliver phrases that should come effortlessly to such a seasoned vocalist; her vocal cords are plagued by edema, her voice reedy and lacking the crystalline clarity it once possessed on classics like &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;.43 Although critical of Houston's voice, Cinquemani also noted how her vocal change benefited the album: &quot;[Houston] sounds alive, and seemingly happy to be. [...] The New Voice lives more contently in the midtempo numbers that allow her to sink into the grooves. [...] For the most part, I Look to You manages to sound completely contemporary without the use of guest rappers, dumbed-down lyrics, or slang.&quot;44 Likewise, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who gave the album a B- rating, felt that Houston's huskier vocals lent an emotion intensity to the album: &quot;Houston's famous voice, which now sounds husky and glottal, as if her vocal cords were sent through a washer-dryer cycle with a handful of small rocks, brings a gravity that the album's often generically worded ballads lack.&quot; However, the critic criticized the album for its lack of insight on her struggles of the past years, writing &quot;listeners may feel shut out of the fight. Whatever hardship she's endured, the battles within remain a mystery.&quot;45
Allmusic gave I Look to You three stars (out of five) commenting about Houston's problems in the past, her voice and her talent: &quot;I Look to You attempts to wash this all away with something of a return to roots &lt;U+2014&gt; a celebration of Houston's deep disco beginnings, tempered with a few skyscraping ballads designed to showcase her soaring voice. Houston's rocky decade isn't ignored, but it isn't explored, either: songs allude to Whitney's strength, her willpower as a survivor struggling through some unnamed struggle &lt;U+2014&gt; enough for listeners to fill in the blanks, either with their own experience or their imaginings of Houston's life. [...] at the very least, Whitney can still sing, knowing when to wring emotion out of a phrase, knowing when not to push for the glory notes that she can no longer hit. [...] What she undoubtedly is, is a pro &lt;U+2014&gt; she sells these subdued glitzy productions, she makes boring songs interesting, she remains a forceful, tangible presence.46 Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the album 4 out of 5 stars and said that &quot;thanks to contributions from a clutch of au courant R&amp;B producers, it does sound contemporary...her voice may not be as technically impressive at it was, but its new, more weathered tones have character, making an optimistic song like 'Million Dollar Bill' really quite touching and a defiant one like 'For The Lovers' more dramatic. If a little too steady to be called a classic, I Look To You is certainly an accomplished, enjoyable return &lt;U+2013&gt; don't call it a comeback &lt;U+2013&gt; from an artist who sounds keen again, a lioness who's rediscovered her pride.47 Los Angeles Times critic Ann Powers gave the album three stars (out of four): &quot;Though I Look to You doesn't soar like the old days, it's fine to hear Houston working on her own recovery plan.48
