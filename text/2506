The '''Bar-headed Goose''' (''Anser indicus'') is a [[goose]]  which breeds in [[Central Asia]] in colonies of thousands near mountain lakes and winters in [[South Asia]], as far south as peninsular India. It lays three to eight eggs at a time in a ground nest.

==Taxonomy==
The Bar-headed Goose has sometimes been separated from ''Anser'', which has no other member indigenous to the Indian region, nor any at all to the Ethiopian, Australian, or Neotropical regions, and placed in the [[monotypic]] [[genus]] ''Eulabeia''.

==Description==
The bird is pale grey and is easily distinguished from any of the other grey geese of the genus ''[[Anser (genus)|Anser]]'' by the black bars on its head. It is also much paler than the other geese in this genus. In flight, its call is a typical goose honking. A mid-sized goose, it measures {{convert|71|<U+2013>|76|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length and weighs {{convert|1.87|-|3.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

==Ecology==
[[File:Bar-headed Goose RWD1.jpg|left|thumb|Swimming at Sylvan Heights Waterfowl Park]]

The summer habitat is high-altitude lakes where the bird grazes on short grass. The species has been reported as migrating south from Tibet, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia before crossing the Himalaya. The bird has come to the attention of medical science in recent years as having been an early victim of the H5N1 virus, HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza), at Qinghai. It suffers [[predation]] from crows, foxes, ravens, sea eagles, gulls and others.  The total population may, however, be increasing, but it is complex to assess population trends, as this species occurs over more than {{convert|2500000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IUCN/>

The challenging northward migration from lowland India to breed in the summer on the Tibetan Plateau is undertaken in stages, with the flight across the Himalaya (from sea-level) being undertaken non-stop in as little as seven hours. Surprisingly, despite predictable tail winds that blow up the Himalayas (in the same direction of travel as the geese), bar-headed geese spurn these winds, waiting for them to die down overnight, when they then undertake the greatest rates of climbing flight ever recorded for a bird, and sustain these climbs rates for hours on end, according to research published in 2011.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1017295108 |title=The Trans-Himalayan Flights of Bar-headed Geese (''Anser indicus'') |year=2011 |last1=Hawkes |first1=L.

The 2011 study found the geese peaking at an altitude of around 6,400&nbsp;m (21,000&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Than" /> In a 2012 study that tagged 91 geese and tracked their migration routes, it was determined that the geese spent 95% of their time below {{convert|5784|m|ft|abbr=on}}, choosing to take a longer route through the Himalayas in order to utilize lower-altitude valleys and passes. Only 10 of the tagged geese were ever recorded above this altitude, and only one exceeded {{convert|6500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, reaching {{convert|7290|m|ft|abbr=on}}. All but one of these high altitude flights were recorded at night, which along with the early morning, is the most common time of day for geese migration. The colder denser air during these times may be equivalent to an altitude hundreds of meters lower. It is suspected by the authors of these two studies that tales of the geese flying at {{convert|8000|m|ft|abbr=on}} are apocryphal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkes |first1=L.

The Bar-headed Goose is often kept in captivity, as it is considered beautiful and breeds readily. Records{{clarify|date=February 2013|reason="Records" of what? This is a weird way to use the word.}} in [[Great Britain]] are frequent, and almost certainly relate to escapes. However, the species has bred on several occasions in recent years and around five pairs were recorded in 2002, the most recent available report of the Rare Birds Breeding Panel. It is possible the species is becoming gradually more established in Great Britain. The bird is sociable and causes no problems for other birds.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The [[Feral animal|feral]] population is believed to be declining in Great Britain due to over-hunting.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Physiology and morphology==
[[File:Anser indicus rb.jpg|thumb|Head details]]
The main physiological challenge of bar-headed geese is extracting oxygen from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] air and transporting it to [[Cellular respiration|aerobic]] muscle fibres in order to sustain flight at high altitudes. Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Altshuler|first=D.|author2=Dudley, R.|title=The physiology and biomechanics of avian flight at high altitude|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=January 6, 2006|volume=46|issue=1|pages=62<U+2013>71|doi=10.1093/icb/icj008|pmid=21672723|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Studies have found that bar-headed geese breathe more deeply and efficiently under low oxygen conditions, which serves to increase oxygen uptake from the environment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Milsom | first1 = William K. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Graham | year = 2008 | title = Respiratory adaptations in the high flying bar-headed goose | url = | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part C: Toxicology & Pharmacology | volume = 148 | issue = 4| page = 460 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpc.2008.10.047 }}</ref> The [[haemoglobin]] of their blood has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to low-altitude geese,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = X.-Z. | last2 = Li | first2 = S.-L. | last3 = Jing | first3 = H. | last4 = Liang | first4 = Y.-H. | last5 = Hua | first5 = Z.-Q. | last6 = Lu | first6 = G.-Y. | year = 2001 | title = Avian haemoglobins and structural basis of high affinity for oxygen: Structure of bar-headed goose aquomet haemoglobin | url = | journal = Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography | volume = 57 | issue = 6| pages = 775<U+2013>783 | doi = 10.1107/S0907444901004243 }}</ref> which has been attributed to a single [[amino acid]] [[point mutation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jessen, T.|author2=Weber, R.E|author3= Fermi, G|author4= Tame, J|author5= and|title=Adaptation of bird hemoglobins to high altitudes: demonstration of molecular mechanism by protein engineering.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=August 1, 1991|volume=88|issue=51|pages=6519<U+2013>22|pmid=1862080|accessdate=20 December 2012|pmc=52117}}</ref> This mutation causes a conformational shift in the haemoglobin molecule from the low oxygen affinity form to the high oxygen affinity form.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang, J.|author2=Hua, Z|author3= Tame, J.R|author4= Zhang, R|author5= Gu, X.|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=January 26, 1996|volume=255|issue=3|pages=484<U+2013>93|pmid=8568892|accessdate=20 December 2012|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0040}}</ref> The left-ventricle of the heart, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the body via [[systemic circulation]], has significantly more [[capillaries]] in bar-headed geese compared with lowland birds, maintaining oxygenation of [[cardiac muscle cell]]s and thereby [[cardiac output]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott, G.R.|author2=Schulte, P.M|author3= Egginton, S|author4= Scott, A.L|author5= Richards, J.G|author6= Milsom, W.K.|title=Molecular evolution of cytochrome C oxidase underlies high-altitude adaptation in the bar-headed goose.|journal=Molecular Biology Evolution|date=January 2011|volume=28|issue=1|pages=351<U+2013>63|doi=10.1093/molbev/msq205|pmid=20685719|accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Compared to lowland birds, [[mitochondria]] (the main site of oxygen consumption) in the flight muscle of bar-headed geese are significantly closer to the [[sarcolemma]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scott, G.R.|author2=Egginton, S|author3= Richards, J.G|author4= Milsom, W.K.|title=Evolution of muscle phenotype for extreme high altitude flight in the bar-headed goose.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B|date=October 22, 2009|volume=276|issue=1673|pages=3645<U+2013>53|pmid=19640884|accessdate=20 December 2012|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0947|pmc=2817306}}</ref> decreasing the intracellular diffusion distance of oxygen from the capillaries to the mitochondria.
