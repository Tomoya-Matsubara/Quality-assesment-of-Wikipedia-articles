In [[Norse mythology]], '''Hl<U+00ED>n''' ([[Old Norse]] "protectoress"<ref name=ORCHARD86>Orchard (1997:86).</ref>) is a [[<U+00C1>ss|goddess]] associated with the goddess [[Frigg]]. Hl<U+00ED>n appears in a poem in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and in [[kennings]] found in [[skald]]ic poetry. Hl<U+00ED>n has been theorized as possibly another name for Frigg.

==Attestations==
In the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]]'', Hl<U+00ED>n receives a mention regarding the foretold death of the god [[Odin]] during the immense battle waged at [[Ragnar<U+00F6>k]]:
<blockquote>
:Then is fulfilled Hl<U+00ED>n's
:second sorrow,
:when <U+00D3><U+00F0>inn goes
:to fight with [[Fenrir|the wolf]],
:and [[Beli]]'s [[Freyr|slayer]],
:bright, against [[Surtr]].
:Then shall Frigg's
:sweet friend fall.<ref name=DRONKE21>Dronke (1997:21).</ref>
</blockquote>

In chapter 35 of the ''Prose Edda'' book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Hl<U+00ED>n is cited twelfth among a series of sixteen goddesses. [[High, Just-As-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gangleri]] (earlier in the book described as King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Hl<U+00ED>n "is given the function of protecting people whom Frigg wishes to save from some danger." High continues that, from this, "someone who escapes finds refuge (''hleinar'')."<ref name=FAULKES30>Faulkes (1995:30).</ref> In chapter 51, the above mentioned ''V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>'' stanza is quoted.<ref name=FAULKES55>Faulkes (1995:55).</ref> In chapter 75 of the book ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]'' Hl<U+00ED>n appears within a list of 27 <U+00E1>synjur names.<ref name=FAULKES157>Faulkes (1995:157).</ref>

In [[skaldic poetry]], the name Hl<U+00ED>n is frequent in [[kenning]]s for women. Examples include ''Hl<U+00ED>n hringa'' (Hl<U+00ED>n of rings), ''Hl<U+00ED>n go<U+00F0>vefjar'' (Hl<U+00ED>n of velvet) and ''arm-Hl<U+00ED>n'' (arm-Hl<U+00ED>n). The name is already used frequently in this way by the 10th-century poet [[Korm<U+00E1>kr <U+00D6>gmundarson]] and remains current in skaldic poetry through the following centuries, employed by poets such as [[<U+00DE><U+00F3>r<U+00F0>r Kolbeinsson]], [[Gizurr <U+00DE>orvaldsson]] and [[Einarr Gilsson]].<ref>Finnur J<U+00F3>nsson (1931:263).</ref>

==Theories==
Andy Orchard says that in ''V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>'', Hl<U+00ED>n appears to be just another name for Frigg, and adds that "the numerous occurrences of the name in skaldic poetry in poetic periphrases or kennings for women do nothing to dispel the confusion."<ref name=ORCHARD86/> [[Rudolf Simek]] agrees that Hl<U+00ED>n seems to appear as another name for Frigg in ''V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>'', and that in skaldic poetry Hl<U+00ED>n was a well known mythological figure by the 10th century. Simek states that Hl<U+00ED>n is likely simply another name for Frigg, and that Snorri "misunderstood her to be a goddess in her own right in his reading of the ''V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>'' stanza."<ref name=SIMEK153>Simek (2007:153).</ref>

However, in the same work, Rudolf Simek also says that the goddesses [[S<U+00E1>ga]], Hl<U+00ED>n, [[Sj<U+00F6>fn]], [[Snotra]], [[V<U+00E1>r]], and [[V<U+00F6>r]] should be considered vaguely defined figures who "should be seen as female protective goddesses" that are all responsible for "specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to [[Matres and Matrones|matrons]]."<ref name=SIMEK274>Simek (2007:274).</ref> [[John Lindow]] observes that if Hl<U+00ED>n is indeed Frigg, then this means that Hl<U+00ED>n's "second sorrow" in ''V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>'' is the death of Baldr.<ref name=LINDOW177>Lindow (2001:177).</ref>
