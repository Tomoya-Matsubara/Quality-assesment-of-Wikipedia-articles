'''Tropical Storm Allison''' was a [[tropical cyclone#Intensity classifications|tropical storm]] that devastated southeast [[Texas]] in June of the [[2001 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The first storm of the season, Allison lasted unusually long for a June storm, remaining tropical or subtropical for 15&nbsp;days. The storm developed from a [[tropical wave]] in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on June 4, 2001, and struck the upper Texas coast shortly thereafter. It drifted northward through the state, turned back to the south, and re-entered the Gulf of Mexico. The storm continued to the east-northeast, made landfall on [[Louisiana]], then moved across the southeast United States and [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]]. Allison was the first storm since [[Tropical Storm Frances (1998)|Tropical Storm Frances]] in 1998 to strike the northern Texas coastline.<ref name="ivey">{{cite web|author=John P. Ivey|year=2002|title=Flood Safety and Tropical Storm Allison|accessdate=2006-05-15|url=http://www.floodsafety.com/media/pdfs/texas/ivey.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at over 40&nbsp;inches (1,000&nbsp;mm) in Texas. The worst flooding occurred in [[Houston]], where most of Allison's damage occurred: 30,000 became homeless after the storm flooded over 70,000&nbsp;houses and destroyed 2,744&nbsp;homes. Downtown Houston was inundated with flooding, causing severe damage to hospitals and businesses. Twenty-three people died in Texas. Along its entire path, Allison caused $5.5 billion ($6.7&nbsp;billion 2008&nbsp;USD) in damage and 41 deaths. Aside from Texas, the places worst hit were Louisiana and southeastern [[Pennsylvania]].

Following the storm, President [[George W. Bush]] designated 75 counties along Allison's path as disaster areas (the first time he had to do so), which enabled the citizens affected to apply for aid. Allison is the only tropical storm to have its name [[List of retired Atlantic hurricane names|retired]] without ever having reached hurricane strength.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Allison 2001 track.png}}
A tropical wave moved off the coast of [[Africa]] on May 21, 2001. It moved westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], retaining little convection on its way. After moving across [[South America]] and the southwestern [[Caribbean Sea]], the wave entered the eastern North [[Pacific Ocean]] on June 1. A low-level circulation developed on June 2, while it was about 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Salina Cruz]], [[Mexico]]. Southerly flow forced the system northward, and the wave moved inland on June 3. The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on June 4, and developed deep convection on its eastern side.<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=Stacy R.

At 1200&nbsp;UTC on June 5, the disturbance developed a broad, low-level circulation, and was classified as Tropical Storm Allison, the first storm of the [[2001 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Some intensification was projected, though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stewart|title=Tropical Storm Allison Discussion Number 1|date=June 5, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-08-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al012001.discus.001.html}}</ref> Due to the cold-core nature of the center, Allison initially contained [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical characteristics]]. Despite this, the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 60&nbsp;mph (95&nbsp;km/h), with tropical storm-force winds extending up to 230&nbsp;miles (370&nbsp;km) east of the center, and a minimum central pressure of 1000 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]].<ref name="TCR"/> The storm initially moved very little, and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location.<ref name="disc2">{{cite web|author=Stewart|title=Tropical Storm Allison Discussion Number 2|date=June 5, 2001|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al012001.discus.002.html|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=National Hurricane Center}}</ref>

Later in the day, several different track forecasts arose. One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward in to Mexico. Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana. At the time, it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center, but rather to the north and east.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lawrence|title=Tropical Storm Allison Discussion Number 3|date=June 5, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-08-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/dis/al012001.discus.003.html}}</ref> Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east<U+2013>west orientation across the southeast [[United States]],<ref name="disc2"/> Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline, and struck near [[Freeport, Texas]] with 50&nbsp;mph (80&nbsp;km/h) winds.<ref name="TCR"/> Inland, the storm rapidly weakened, and the [[National Hurricane Center]] discontinued advisories early on June 6.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pasch|title=Tropical Depression Allison Public Advisory Number 4|date=June 6, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-08-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/pub/al012001.public.004.html}}</ref> Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression, surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center, which had reformed closer to the deep convection.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pasch|title=Tropical Depression Allison Discussion Number 4|date=June 6, 2001|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2008-08-16|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2001/ALLISON.html}}</ref>

The depression drifted northward until reaching [[Lufkin, Texas]], where it stalled due to a high pressure system to its north.<ref name="TCR"/>  While stalling over Texas, the storm dropped excessive rainfall, peaking at just over 40&nbsp;inches (1,033&nbsp;mm) in northwestern [[Jefferson County, Texas|Jefferson County]].<ref name="hpc">{{cite web|author=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|year=2006|title=Rainfall totals from Tropical Storm Allison|accessdate=2006-05-17|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/allison2001.html}}</ref>  On June 7, the subtropical ridge off [[Florida]] weakened, while the ridge west of Texas intensified.

The storm was officially downgraded to a subtropical depression at 0000&nbsp;UTC on June 12.

Tropical Storm Allison was a major flood disaster throughout its path from Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in [[Houston]], Texas, where over 35&nbsp;inches (890&nbsp;mm) of rain fell. Allison killed 41&nbsp;people, of which 27 drowned. The storm also caused over $5&nbsp;billion in damage (2001&nbsp;USD, $6.4&nbsp;billion 2007&nbsp;USD), making Allison the deadliest and costliest tropical storm on record in the United States.<ref name="TCR"/>

===Retirement===
{{seealso|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}
Due to extreme destruction, the name Allison was retired in the Spring of 2002, and will never again be used in the [[Atlantic basin]]; the 2001 incarnation of Allison is the only Atlantic tropical system to have its name retired without reaching hurricane strength.  The name was replaced with [[Subtropical Storm Andrea (2007)|Andrea]] in the [[2007 Atlantic hurricane season|2007 season]].
