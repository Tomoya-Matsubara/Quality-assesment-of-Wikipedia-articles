'''Nigeria''' ({{pron-en|na<U+026A><U+02C8>d<U+0292><U+026A><U+0259>ri<U+0259>}}), officially the '''Federal Republic of Nigeria''', is a [[federation|federal]] [[constitutional republic]] comprising [[States of Nigeria|thirty-six states]] and it's [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]], [[Abuja]]. The country is located in [[West Africa]] and shares land [[border]]s with the Republic of [[Benin]] in the west, [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]] in the east, and [[Niger]] in the north. Its coast in the south lies on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The three largest and most influential ethnic groups in Nigeria are the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]. In terms of religion Nigeria is roughly split half and half between Muslims and Christians with a very small minority who practice traditional religions. 

The people of Nigeria have an [[History of Nigeria|extensive history]]. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence shows that human habitation of the area dates back to at least 9000 BC.<ref name=mcintoshandkeech>''McIntosh, Susan Keech, Current directions in west African prehistory. Palo Alto, California: Annual Reviews Inc., 1981. 215<U+2013>258 p.: ill.''</ref> The area around the [[Benue River|Benue]] and [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] is thought to be the original homeland of the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu migrants]] who spread across most of [[Central Africa|central]] and [[southern Africa]] in waves between the [[1st millennium BC]] and the [[2nd millennium]].

The name ''[[Wikt:Nigeria|Nigeria]]'' was taken from the [[River Niger]] running through the country. This name was coined by [[Flora Shaw]], the future wife of [[Frederick Lugard|Baron Lugard]], a [[British Empire|British colonial]] administrator, in the late 19th century.

Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, the [[list of countries by population|eighth most populous country in the world]], and the most populous country in the world in which the majority of the population is '[[Black people|black]]'. It is listed among the "[[Next Eleven]]" economies, and is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The [[economy of Nigeria]] is one of the [[Emerging markets|fastest growing in the world]], with the [[International Monetary Fund]] projecting a growth of 9% in 2008 and 8.3% in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2008/CAR021508A.htm |title=IMF Survey: Nigeria Needs Sustained Reforms to Build on Success |publisher=Imf.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Aminu |first=Ayodele |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200804140655.html |title=allAfrica.com: Africa: IMF Forecasts 9 Percent Growth for Nigeria (Page 1 of 1) |publisher=Allafrica.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Godwin |first=Atser |url=http://www.punchng.com/Articl.aspx?theartic=Art20080229153046 |title=The Punch: IMF predicts 9% GDP growth rate for Nigeria |publisher=Punchng.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentngonline.com/news/head/article08 |title=: Welcome to Independent Newspapers Limited - A voice of your own |publisher=Independentngonline.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref> It is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|second largest economy in Africa]], and is a [[regional power]] that is also the [[Regional_hegemony |hegemon]] in [[West Africa]].

Retrieved February 22, 2007.''</ref> A Nok sculpture resident at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, portrays a sitting dignitary wearing a "Shepherds Crook" on the right arm, and a "hinged flail" on the left. These are symbols of authority associated with ancient Egyptian pharaohs, and the god Osiris, and suggests that an ancient Egyptian style of social structure, and perhaps religion, existed in the area of modern Nigeria during the late Pharonic period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artsmia.org/viewer/detail.php?id=5368&i=20&v=12&dept=8&op=1449 |title=artsmia.org : viewer |publisher=Artsmia.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref> 

In the northern part of the country, [[Kano]] and [[Katsina]] had recorded history dateing back to around [[999]]. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] kingdoms and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]] prospered as trade posts between North and West Africa. At the beginning of the 19th century under [[Usman dan Fodio]] the [[Fula people|Fulani]] leaded the centralized [[Fulani Empire]] which continued until 1903 when the Fulani population and land were divided into various European colonies. Between 1750 and 1900, between one to two-thirds of the entire population of the [[Fulani War|Fulani jihad]] states consisted of slaves.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 Slavery].

The Yoruba kingdoms of [[Ife|If<U+1EB9>]] and [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] in the southwestern block of Nigeria became prominent around 700<U+2014>900 and 1400 respectively. However, Yoruba mythology states that Ile-Ife is the source of the human race and that it predates any other civilization. If<U+1EB9> also produced terra cotta and bronze figures and <U+1ECC>y<U+1ECD> once extended from western Nigeria to [[Togo]]. Arguably the most powerful and prominent kingdom in the whole of Nigeria's history was also located in southwestern Nigeria, the [[Kingdom of Benin]]. Benin's power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the city of Eko (a Bini name later changed to [[Lagos]] by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]) and further.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/nigeria/7.htm The Slave Trade].

In southeastern Nigeria the [[Nri Kingdom|Kingdom of Nri]] of the [[Igbo people]] flourished from the controversial date of around the 10th century until 1911, making it the oldest kingdom in Nigeria. The Nri Kingdom was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]]. The city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture. Nri and Aguleri, where the Igbo creation myth originates, are in the territory of the Umeuri clan, who trace their lineages back to the patriarchal king-figure, [[Eri (divine king)|Eri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Uzukwu |first=E.

Portuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin trade in Nigeria in the port they named [[Lagos]] and in [[Calabar]]. The Europeans traded with the ethnicities of the coast and also negotiated [[Atlantic slave trade|a trade in slaves]], to the detriment and profit of many Nigerian ethnicities. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the British expanded trade with the Nigerian interior. Consequently many of the citizens of the former slave nations of the [[British Empire]] are descended from a Nigerian ethnic group.

In 1885 British claims to a West African [[sphere of influence]] received international recognition and in the following year the [[Royal Niger Company]] was chartered under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On January 1, 1901 Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. Many wars against subjugation had been fought by the states of what later became Nigeria against the British Empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Notably of those were the [[British Conquest of Benin]] in 1897 and the [[Anglo-Aro War]] from 1901<U+2014>1902. The restraint or complete destruction of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.

In 1914, the Niger area was formally united as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria|southern]] provinces and Lagos colony. Western education and the development of a modern economy proceeded more rapidly in the south than in the north, with consequences felt in Nigeria's political life ever since. [[African slave trade|Slavery]] was not finally outlawed in northern Nigeria until 1936.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page56.shtml The end of slavery], BBC World Service | The Story of Africa.</ref> 

Following [[World War II]], in response to the growth of Nigerian [[nationalism]] and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British Government moved Nigeria toward [[self-government]] on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, the great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa.

=== Post-independence ===
On October 1, 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from the United Kingdom. The new republic incorporated a number of people with aspirations of their own sovereign nations. Newly independent, Nigeria's government was a coalition of conservative parties: the [[National Party of Nigeria|Nigerian People's Congress]] (NPC), a party dominated by Northerners and those of the [[Islamic]] faith, and the Igbo and Christian dominated [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) led by [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], who became Nigeria's maiden [[Governor-General]] in 1960. Forming the opposition was the comparatively liberal [[Action Group]] (AG), which was largely dominated by the Yoruba and led by [[Obafemi Awolowo]].<ref name=JBS>''Udofia, Nigerian Political Parties: Their Role in Modernizing the political System, 1920-1966, Journal of Black Studies, June 1981. Retrieved February 22, 2007, pp. 437<U+2013>447.''</ref> The cultural and political differences between Nigeria's dominant ethnicities, the Hausa ('Northerners'), Igbo ('Easterners') and Yoruba ('Westerners'), were sharp.

An imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the 1961 plebiscite. [[Southern Cameroons|Southern Cameroon]] opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while northern Cameroon chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. The nation parted with its British legacy in 1963 by declaring itself a [[Federal Republic]], with Azikiwe as it's first [[President of Nigeria|president]]. When elections came about in 1965, the AG was outmanoeuvered for control of Nigeria's Western Region by the [[Nigerian National Democratic Party]], an amalgamation of conservative Yoruba elements backed heavily by the Federal Government amid dubious electoral circumstances. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

=== Nigerian-Biafran War ===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}
The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led in 1966 to several back-to-back [[military coup]]s. The first was in January and led by a collection of young leftists under Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna and Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu. It was partially successful; the coup plotters murdered the Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the Premier of the Northern Region, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and the Premier of the Western Region, Sir Ladoke Akintola. Despite this, the coupists could not set up a central government because of logistic reasons. Sir Nwafor Orizu, the acting President was then pressured to hand over government to the Nigeria Army, under the Command of General JTU Aguyi-Ironsi. 

The coup was counter-acted by another successful plot, supported primarily by Northern military officers and Northerners who favoured the NPC, it was engineered by Northern officers, which allowed Lt Colonel [[Yakubu Gowon]] to become head of state. This sequence of events led to an increase in ethnic tension and violence. The Northern coup, which was mostly motivated by ethnic and religious reasons was a bloodbath of both military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo extraction.

The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for autonomy and protection from the military's wrath. By May 1967, the Eastern Region had declared itself an independent state called the [[Republic of Biafra]] under the leadership of Lt Colonel [[Emeka Ojukwu]] in line with the wishes of the people. The [[Nigerian Civil War]] began as the Nigerian (Western and Northern) side attacked Biafra (South-eastern) on July 6, 1967 at Garkem signalling the beginning of the 30&nbsp;month war that ended in January 1970.<ref name=DDRS>''"Background Paper on Nigeria and Biafra, Declassified Documents reference System''.</ref> More than one million people died in the three-year civil war.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6657259.stm Reopening Nigeria's civil war wounds]. BBC News. May 30, 2007.</ref> 

Following the war, Nigeria became to an extent even more mired in ethnic strife, as the defeated southeast and indeed southern Nigeria was now conquered territory for the federal military regime, which changed heads of state twice as army officers staged a bloodless coup against Gowon and enthroned Murtala Mohammed; Olusegun Obansanjo succeeded the former after an [[Buka Suka Dimka|assassination]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== Military era ===
[[File:Nigerian troops with US C130.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Nigerian troops, part of the [[United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur]], embarking on a US Aircraft]] 
During the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria joined [[OPEC]] and billions of dollars generated by production in the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]] flowed into the coffers of the Nigerian state. However, increasing [[Political corruption|corruption]] and graft at all levels of government squandered most of these earnings. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The northern military clique benefited immensely from the oil boom to the detriment of the Nigerian people and economy. As oil revenues fuelled the rise of federal subventions to states and precariously to individuals, the Federal Government soon became the centre of political struggle and the centre became the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government created a dangerous situation as it became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and the international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns eschewing economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.<ref name=>''Watts Michael, State, Oil and Agriculture in Nigeria, Berkeley, 1987. Retrieved February 22, 2007.''</ref>

Beginning in 1979, Nigerians participated in a brief return to democracy when Obasanjo transferred power to the civilian regime of [[Shehu Shagari]]. The Shagari government was viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society, so when the regime was overthrown by the military coup of [[Mohammadu Buhari]] shortly after the regime's fraudulent re-election in 1984, it was generally viewed as a positive development by most of the population.<ref name=>''Nigeria, Military Faces Daunting Challenges, AP Press International, March 3, 1984. Retrieved February 22, 2007.''</ref> Buhari promised major reforms but his government fared little better than its predecessor, and his regime was overthrown by yet another military coup in 1985.<ref name=Globe>''Nigeria stays calms as leader toppled in bloodless coup, The Globe and Mail, August 28, 1985. Retrieved February 22, 2007.''</ref>

The new head of state, [[Ibrahim Babangida]], promptly declared himself [[President]] and Commander in chief of the Armed Forces and the ruling [[Supreme Military Council (Nigeria)|Supreme Military Council]] and also set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund's]] Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt, which most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing. He also inflamed religious tensions in the nation and particularly the south by enrolling Nigeria in the [[Organization of the Islamic Conference]].<ref name= AP>''Michael Holman, Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify, Financial Times, February 24, 1986.''</ref>

After Babangida survived an abortive coup, he pushed back the promised return to democracy to 1992. When free and fair elections were finally held on the 12th of June, 1993, Babangida declared that the results showing a presidential victory for [[Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola]] null and void, sparking mass civilian violence in protest which effectively shut down the country for weeks and forced Babangida to keep his shaky promise to relinquish office to a civilian run government.<ref name=>''Bilski Andrew, "Broken Promises" Maclean, September 6, 1993.''</ref> Babangida's regime is adjudged to be at the apogee of corruption in the history of the nation as it was during his time that corruption became officially diluted in Nigeria.<ref name=>''Diamond, larry, Kirk-Greene Anthoiny, Oyeleye Oyediran, Transition without End: Nigerian Politics and Civil Society Under Babangida.''</ref>

Babangida's caretaker regime headed by [[Ernest Shonekan]] survived only until late 1993 when General [[Sani Abacha]] took power in another military coup. Abacha proved to be perhaps Nigeria's most brutal ruler and employed violence on a wide scale to suppress the continuing pandemic of civilian unrest. Money had been found in various western European countries banks traced to him. He avoided coup plots by bribing army generals. Several hundred millions dollars in accounts traced to him were unearthed in 1999.<ref name=>''"Nigerian Lawyer: Abacha accounts apparently in Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, and Germany", AP press, January 10, 2000.''</ref> The regime would come to an end in 1998 when the dictator was found dead amid dubious circumstances. Abacha's death yielded an opportunity for return to civilian rule.

=== Recent history ===
Nigeria re-achieved democracy in 1999 when it elected [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], the former military head of state, as the new [[President of Nigeria|President]] ending almost thirty three-years of military rule (from 1966 until 1999) excluding the short-lived [[Shehu Shagari|second republic]] (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat|coups d'<U+00E9>tat]] and counter-coups during the [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966-1979 and 1983-1998]].

Although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development. While Obasanjo showed willingness to fight corruption, he was accused by others of the same.{{Who|date=August 2007}}

[[Umaru Yar'Adua]], of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], came into power in the [[Nigerian general election, 2007|general election of 2007]] <U+2013> an election that was witnessed and condemned by the international community as being massively flawed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eueom-ng.org/Files/final_report.pdf|format=PDF|title= Final Report |publisher= EU Election Observation Mission Nigeria 2007|accessdate=2008-01-24 }}</ref>

Ethnic violence over the oil producing [[Niger Delta]] region (see [[Conflict in the Niger Delta]]) and inadequate infrastructures are some of the current issues in the country.

Nigeria is a Federal Republic modelled [[Government of the United States|after the United States]], with [[executive power]] exercised by the [[president]] and with overtones of the [[Westminster System]] model in the composition and management of the upper and lower houses of the bicameral legislature.
The current president of Nigeria is [[Umaru Yar'Adua|Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]] who was elected in 2007. The president presides as both [[Chief of State]] and [[Head of Government]] and is elected by [[popular vote]] to a maximum of two four-year terms. 

The president's power is checked by a [[Nigerian Senate|Senate]] and a [[House of Representatives of Nigeria|House of Representatives]], which are combined in a [[bicameral]] body called the [[National Assembly of Nigeria|National Assembly]]. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats and the number of seats per state is determined by population.

Ethnocentrism, tribalism, religious persecution, and [[prebendalism]] have played a visible role in Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics and has spurned various attempts by tribalists to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests.<ref>[[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], who served briefly as Nigeria's second president, devoted his government to combating this phenomenon with Decree 33, which banned 81 political parties and 26 tribal and cultural organizations in the name of national unity. See Osaghae, ''The Crippled Giant: Nigeria Since Independence'', Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 57. ISBN 0-253-21197-2.</ref> Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as [[MASSOB]], Nationalist movements such as [[Oodua Peoples Congress]], [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] and a [[Nigerian civil war|civil war]]. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian [[politics]]; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.<ref>See, for instance, Rashid, Khadijat K. "Ethnicity and Sub-Nationalism in Nigeria: Movement for a Mid-West State/Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria/Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria", in ''African Studies Review'', September, 2003.</ref>
[[File:Abuja skyline.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Abuja, Capital City of Nigeria]]

Because of the above issues, Nigeria's current political parties are [[pan-nationalism|pan-national]] and irreligious in character (though this does not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicities).<ref>Ibid. See also, [http://www12.georgetown.edu/students/organizations/nscs/capitalscholar/lancia2.html Lancia, Nicole. "Ethnic Politics in Nigeria: The Realities of Regionalism" in Capitol Scholar].</ref> The major political parties at present include the ruling [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party of Nigeria]] which maintains 223 seats in the House and 76 in the Senate (61.9% and 69.7% respectively) and is led by the current President [[Umaru Musa Yar'Adua]]; the opposition [[All Nigeria People's Party]] under the leadership of [[Muhammadu Buhari]] has 96 House seats and 27 in the Senate (26.6% and 24.7%). There are also about twenty other minor opposition parties registered. The immediate past president, [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], acknowledged fraud and other electoral "lapses" but said the result reflected opinion polls. In a national television address he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years.<ref>{{cite web|last=McGreal |first=Chris |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2064068,00.html |title=Ruling party named winner in disputed Nigerian election &#124; World news &#124; The Guardian |publisher=Guardian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

Like in many other African societies, [[prebendalism]] and extremely excessive corruption continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria, as vote rigging and other means of coercion are practised by all major parties in order to remain competitive. In 1983, it was adjudged by the policy institute at Kuru that only the 1959 and 1979 elections witnessed minimal rigging.<ref name=>''Jibrin Ibrahim, Legislation and the Electoral Process: The Third Term Agenda and the Future of Nigerian Democracy. Paper for Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) Nigeria Roundtable, 2006.''</ref> 

=== Law ===
There are four distinct systems of law in Nigeria:
*[[English law]] which is derived from its [[British Empire|colonial]] past with Britain;
*[[Common law]], a development of its post colonial independence;
*[[Customary law]] which is derived from indigenous traditional norms and practice, including the dispute resolution meetings of pre-colonial Yorubaland secret societies and the [[Egbo|<U+00C8>kp<U+00E8>]] and Ok<U+00F3>nk<U+00F2> of [[Igboland]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibioland]];
*[[Sharia]] law, used only in the predominantly Muslim north of the country. It is an Islamic legal system which had been used long before the colonial administration in Nigeria but recently politicised and spearheaded in [[Zamfara State|Zamfara]] in late 1999 and eleven other states followed suit. These states are [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Katsina State|Katsina]], [[Niger State|Niger]], [[Bauchi State|Bauchi]], [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Gombe State|Gombe]], [[Sokoto State|Sokoto]], [[Jigawa State|Jigawa]], [[Yobe State|Yobe]], and [[Kebbi State|Kebbi]].<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_rights_quarterly/v026/26.3nmehielle.pdf Sharia Law in the Northern States of Nigeria: To Implement or Not to Implement, the Constitutionality is the Question].</ref>

The country has a [[judicial branch]], the highest court of which is the [[Supreme Court of Nigeria]].

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Nigeria}}
Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made the liberation and restoration of the dignity of Africa the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the apartheid regime in South Africa.<ref name=>''"Collins Edomaruse, how Obasanjo cut UK, US to size", by Andrew Young, This Day (Nigeria) -, July 20, 2006.''</ref> One notable exception to the African focus of Nigeria's foreign policy was the close relationship the country enjoyed with [[Israel]] throughout the 1960s, with the latter country sponsoring and overseeing the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.<ref>''Golda''. Elinor Burkett, p. 202.</ref>

Nigeria's foreign policy was soon tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war and quickly committed itself to the liberation struggles going on in the Southern Africa sub-region. Though Nigeria never sent an expeditionary force in that struggle, it offered more than rhetoric to the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the racist regime and their incursions in southern Africa, in addition to expediting large sums to aid anti-colonial struggles. Nigeria was also a founding member of the [[Organisation for African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]), and has tremendous influence in [[West Africa]] and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for [[ECOWAS]] and [[ECOMOG]], economic and military organizations respectively.

With this African-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the [[Congo Crisis|Congo]] at the behest of the [[United Nations]] shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time); Nigeria also supported several Pan African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for [[Angola|Angola's]] [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]], [[SWAPO]] in [[Namibia]], and aiding anti-colonial struggles in [[RENAMO|Mozambique]], and [[Rhodesian Bush War|Zimbabwe]] (then Rhodesia) military and economically.

Nigeria retains membership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in late November 2006 organized an Africa-South America Summit in Abuja to promote what some attendees termed "South-South" linkages on a variety of fronts.<ref>See, e.g., the African Union website, at http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/Past/2006/November/SummitASA/summit.htm</ref> Nigeria is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], from which it was temporarily expelled in 1995 under the [[Sani Abacha|Abacha regime]].

Nigeria has remained a key player in the [[Petroleum industry|international oil industry]] since the 1970s, and maintains membership in [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] [[OPEC]] which it joined in July, 1971. Its [[Petroleum in Nigeria|status as a major petroleum producer]] figures prominently in its sometimes vicissitudinous international relations with both [[developed countries]], notably the United States and more recently [[People's Republic of China|China]] and developing countries, notably Ghana, Jamaica and Kenya.<ref name=>''Shaw Timothy, The State of Nigeria: Oil Prices Power Bases and Foreign Policy, Canadian Journal of African Studies, Vol 18, no 2, 1984.''</ref>

Millions of Nigerians have emigrated at times of economic hardship to Europe, North America and Australia among others. It is estimated that over a million [[Nigerian American|Nigerians]] have emigrated to the United States and constitute the [[Nigerian American]] populace. Of such Diasporic communities include the "Egbe Omo Yoruba" society.<ref>[http://www.yorubanation.org/ "Egbe Omo Yoruba, National Association Of Yoruba descendants in North America"], ''yorubanation.org'', May 19, 2007.</ref>

===Military===
[[File:Nigerian Navy Ships Golden6.jpg|thumb|The frigate, [[Aradu (F89)|NNS ''Aradu'']]]]
{{See also|Military of Nigeria}}
The Nigerian Military are charged with protecting The Federal Republic of Nigeria, promoting Nigeria's global security interests, and supporting peacekeeping efforts especially in West Africa.

The Nigerian Military consist of an Army, a Navy and an Air Force. The military in Nigeria have played a major role in the country's history since independence. Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history. Its last period of rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator [[Sani Abacha]] in 1998, with his successor, Abdulsalam Abubakar, handing over power to the democratically elected government of Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999.

Taking advantage of its role as Africa's most populated country, Nigeria has repositioned its military as an African peacekeeping force. Since 1995, the Nigerian military through [[ECOMOG]] mandates have been deployed as peacekeepers in [[Liberia]] (1997), [[Ivory Coast]] (1997<U+2013>1999), [[Sierra Leone]] 1997<U+2013>1999,<ref name=Press>''Ed O'Loughlin, Nigerians outshine the British brass, The Independent (London), March 11, 1998.''</ref> and presently in [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] region under an African Union mandate.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Nigeria}}
[[File:lagbeach.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lagos famous Alpha Beach]]
Nigeria is located in western Africa on the Gulf of Guinea and has a total area of {{convert|923768|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on|lk=out}},<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html Rank Order - Area].</ref> making it the world's 32nd-largest country (after [[Tanzania]]). It is comparable in size to [[Venezuela]], and is about twice the size of [[California]]. It shares a {{convert|4047|km|mi|0|abbr-on}} border with Benin (773&nbsp;km), Niger (1497&nbsp;km), Chad (87&nbsp;km), Cameroon (1690&nbsp;km), and has a coastline of at least 853&nbsp;km.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html CIA World Factbook]. Note that coastlines, and borders based on rivers or natural features, are fractals, the length of which is imprecise and depends on the measurement convention adopted.</ref> The highest point in Nigeria is [[Chappal Waddi]] at {{convert|2419|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The main rivers are the [[Niger River|Niger]] and the [[Benue]] which converge and empty into the [[Niger Delta]], one of the world's largest river deltas and the location of a large area of [[Central African Mangroves]].

Nigeria is also an important center for [[biodiversity]]. It is widely believed that the areas surrounding [[Calabar]], Cross River State, contain the world's largest diversity of [[butterflies]]. The [[drill (mammal)|drill monkey]] is only found in the wild in Southeast Nigeria and neighboring [[Cameroon]].

Nigeria has a varied landscape. The far south is defined by its [[tropical rainforest]] climate, where annual rainfall is {{convert|60|to|80|in|mm|0}} a year.<ref name=gai5>{{cite web |url= http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard5.html|title=Regions Used to Interpret the Complexity of Nigeria |accessdate=2007-07-19 |work=Geographical Alliance of Iowa|publisher=[[University of Northern Iowa]]}}</ref> In the southeast stand the [[Obudu Hills]]. [[Coastal plain]]s are found in both the southwest and the southeast.<ref name=encarta>{{cite encyclopedia |title =Nigeria |encyclopedia=[[Encarta]] |publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]] |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557915/Nigeria.html |accessdate=2007-07-19|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257036644219803|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes}}</ref>. This forest zone's most southerly portion is defined as salt water swamp, also known as a mangrove swamp because of the large amount of [[mangrove]]s in the area. North of this is fresh water swamp, containing different vegetation from the salt water swamp, and north of that is rain forest.<ref name=gai4/> <ref name=gai4>{{cite web |url= http://www.uni.edu/gai/Nigeria/Background/Standard4.html|title=The Human and Physical Characteristics of Nigeria |accessdate=2007-08-13 |work=Geographical Alliance of Iowa|publisher=[[University of Northern Iowa]]}}</ref>

Nigeria's most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River]] valleys (which merge into each other and form a "y" shape).<ref name="encarta">{{cite encyclopedia |title =Nigeria |encyclopedia=[[Encarta]] |publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]] |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761557915/Nigeria.html |accessdate=2007-07-19|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257036644219803|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes}}</ref>. To the southwest of the Niger there is "rugged" [[Highland (geography)|highland]], and to the southeast of the Benue hills and mountains are found all the way to the border with [[Cameroon]], this [[montane]] land is part of the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] [[ecoregion]]. The area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]] ecoregion, an important centre for [[biodiversity]] including the [[drill (mammal)|drill monkey]] which is only found in the wild in this area and across the border in Cameroon. It is widely believed that the areas surrounding [[Calabar]], Cross River State, also in this forest, contain the world's largest diversity of [[butterflies]]. The area of southern Nigeria between the [[River Niger|Niger]] and the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]]s has seen its forest more or less disappear to be replaced by grassland (''see [[Cross-Niger transition forests]]''). 

Everything in between the far south and the far north, is [[savannah]](insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees), and rainfall is between {{convert|20|and|60|in|mm|0}} per year.<ref name=gai5/> The savannah zone's three categories are [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]], plains of tall grass which are interrupted by trees and the most common across the country: Sudan savannah, similar but with "shorter grasses and shorter trees; and [[Sahel]] savannah, comprised patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast.<ref name=gai4/>.  
To the north is the [[Sahel]] with its almost desert-like climate, where rain is less than {{convert|20|in|mm|0}} per year and the [[Sahara Desert]] is encroaching.<ref name=gai5/> In the dry north-east corner of the country lies [[Lake Chad]], which Nigeria shares with [[Niger]], [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]].

=== Environmental issues ===
Nigeria's Delta region, home of the large [[Petroleum in Nigeria|oil industry]], experiences serious [[oil spills]] and other environmental problems. See [[Environmental issues in the Niger Delta]] for more details, and [[Conflict in the Niger Delta]] about strife which has arisen in connection with those issues.

[[Waste management]] including [[sewage treatment]], the linked processes of [[deforestation]] and [[soil degradation]], and [[climate change]] or [[global warming]] are the major environmental problems in Nigeria.

Waste management presents problems in a [[mega city]] like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with economic development, population growth and the inability of municipal councils to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. 

Haphazard industrial planning, increased urbanization, poverty and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste [[pollution]] in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.<ref>D. N. Ogbonna, I. K. E. Ekweozor, F. U. Igwe (2002). "Waste Management: A Tool for Environmental Protection in Nigeria." ''A Journal of the Human Environment'', '''31''', (1) (February 2002).</ref>

In terms of [[global warming]], Africans contribute only about one metric ton of carbon dioxide per person per year. It is perceived by many climate change experts that food production and security in the northern [[sahel]] region of the country will suffer as semi-arid areas will have more dry periods in the future.<ref>[http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/113-8/spheres.html Fields, Scott (2005). "Continental Divide: Why Africa<U+2019>s Climate Change Burden Is Greater".] ''Environmental Health Perspectives'' '''113''' (8), August 2005. Retrieved May 15, 2007.</ref>

== Subdivisions ==
{{Main|States of Nigeria|Local Government Areas of Nigeria|List of cities in Nigeria}}
Nigeria is divided into thirty-six [[State (administrative division)|states]] and one [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]], which are further sub-divided into 774 [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (LGAs). The plethora of states, of which there were only three at independence, reflect the country's tumultuous history and the difficulties of managing such a heterogeneous national entity at all levels of government.

Nigeria has six cities with a population of over 1&nbsp;million people (from largest to smallest: [[Lagos]], [[Kano]], [[Ibadan]], [[Kaduna]], [[Port Harcourt]], and [[Benin City]]). Lagos is the [[List of most populous cities in Africa|largest city in sub-Saharan Africa]], with a population of over [[List of metropolitan areas by population|10&nbsp;million]] in its urban area alone. Population of Nigeria's cities over a million include [[Lagos]] (7,937,932), [[Kano]] (3,848,885), [[Ibadan]] (3,078,400), [[Kaduna]] (1,652,844), [[Port Harcourt]] (1,320,214), [[Benin City]] (1,051,600), [[Maiduguri]] (1,044,497) and [[Zaria]] (1,018,827), however, these figures are regularly disputed in Nigeria.<ref name="felix">{{cite news |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L29819278.htm |publisher=Reuters |title=Nigeria gives census result, avoids risky details |first=Felix |last=Onuah |date=29 December 2006|accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref>

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Nigeria}}
[[File:laglag.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lagos Central Business District, Lagos State, Nigeria]]
Nigeria is classified as an [[emerging markets|emerging market]], and is rapidly approaching middle income status {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, with its abundant supply of resources, well-developed financial, legal, communications, transport sectors and stock exchange (the [[Nigerian Stock Exchange]]), which is the second largest in Africa. Nigeria is ranked 37th in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|GDP (PPP)]] as of 2007. Nigeria is the United States' largest trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa and supplies a fifth of its oil (11% of oil imports). It has the seventh-largest trade surplus with the U.S. of any country worldwide. Nigeria is currently the 50th-largest export market for U.S. goods and the 14th-largest exporter of goods to the U.S. The United States is the country's largest foreign investor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2836.htm |title=Nigeria (07/08) |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref> The bulk of economic activity is centred in 4 main cities: Lagos, Kaduna, Port Harcourt, and Abuja. Beyond these three economic centers, development is marginal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Previously, economic development had been hindered by years of [[military dictatorship|military rule]], corruption, and mismanagement, the restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential as one of the Major Economies in Africa.

{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} According to the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] and the [[World Bank]], Nigerian [[GDP]] at [[purchasing power parity]] has nearly doubled from $170.7&nbsp;billion in 2005 to 292.6&nbsp;billion in 2007. The GDP per head has jumped from $692 per person in 2006 to $1,754 per person in 2007.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/countries/Nigeria/profile.cfm?folder=Profile-FactSheet Economist.com | Country Briefings: Nigeria<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.economist.com.</ref>

During the [[OPEC|oil boom]] of the 1970s, Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal which increased the size of the debt. 

However, after negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement in which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African Country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30&nbsp;billion) owed to the [[Paris Club]].

Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined [[OPEC]] in 1971). [[Petroleum in Nigeria|Petroleum]] plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings.

{{Main|Demographics of Nigeria}} {{See also|Education in Nigeria|List of Nigerian universities}}

[[File:Bev<U+00F6>lkerungsdichte Nigerischer Bundesstaaten english.PNG|thumb|250px|Population density in Nigeria]]
Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa but exactly how populous is a subject of speculation. The [[United Nations]] estimates that the population in 2009 was at 154,729,000, distributed as 51.7% rural and 48.3% urban, and with a population density of 167.5 people per square kilometer. National census results in the past few decades have been disputed. The results of the most recent census were released in December 2006 and gave a population of 140,003,542. The only breakdown available was by gender: males numbered 71,709,859, females numbered 68,293,08.

According to the United Nations, Nigeria has been undergoing explosive population growth and one of the highest growth and fertility rates in the world. By their projections, Nigeria will be one of the countries in the world that will account for most of the world's total population increase by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/pop918.doc.htm |title=WORLD POPULATION TO INCREASE BY 2.6 BILLION OVER NEXT 45 YEARS, WITH ALL GROWTH OCCURRING IN LESS DEVELOPED REGIONS |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>

In 2003, the HIV prevalence rate among 20 to 29 year-olds was 5.6%.<ref>[http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/countries/docs/04profiles/FY04%20OGAC%20Nigeria.Final.pdf Country Profile <U+2013> Nigeria]. Cdc.gov.</ref> About Nigeria, like many developing countries, suffers from a [[polio]] crisis as well as periodic outbreaks of [[cholera]], [[malaria]], and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]. As of 2004, there has been a vaccination drive, spearheaded by the [[World Health Organization|W.H.O.]], to combat [[polio]] and [[malaria]] that has been met with controversy in some regions.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3556777.stm |title=Nigerian state thwarts polio push|publisher=BBC News |date=March 22, 2004 |accessdate=2006-09-07}}</ref>

[[Education]] is also in a state of neglect. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved so that it would reach every subregion of Nigeria. Education is provided free by the government, but the attendance rate for secondary education is only 29% (32% for males, 27% for females). The education system has been described as "dysfunctional" largely because of decaying institutional infrastructure. 68% of the population is [[literate]], and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).<ref name=CP2006/>

Nigeria's largest city is [[Lagos]]. Lagos has grown from 300,000 in 1950<ref>[http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/cities/city_lagos.html Lagos, Nigeria facts - National Geographic].</ref> to an estimated 15 million today, and the Nigerian government estimates that city will have expanded to 25 million residents by 2015.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=60811 Lagos, the mega-city of slums], irinnews.org, September 5, 2006.</ref>

Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The largest ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fulani]]/[[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], accounting for 68% of population, while the [[Edo (ethnic group)|Edo]], [[Ijaw]], [[Kanuri]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], Ebira [[Nupe]] and [[Tiv]] comprise 27%; other minorities make up the remaining 7 percent.<ref name=NGeo>'' Geographica: The complete Atlas of the world, "Nigeria", (Random House, 2002).''</ref> The middle belt of Nigeria is known for its diversity of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and [[Kofyar]]. The official population count of each of Nigeria's ethnicities has always remained controversial and disputed as members of different ethnic groups believe the census is rigged to give a particular group (usually believed to be northern groups) numerical superiority.<ref name="felix"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Growing Apart: Oil, Politics, and Economic Change in Indonesia and Nigeria |first=Peter |last=Lewis |page=132 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-472-06980-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=T4-rlVeb1n0C&pg=PA132 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria |first=Rotimi T. |last=Suberu |publisher=US Institute of Peace Press |year=2001 |page=154 |isbn=1-929-22328-5 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WKeUMmDlPkEC&pg=PA154 |accessdate=2008-12-18}}</ref>

There are small minorities of British, American, [[Indian diaspora|East Indian]], [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] (est. 50,000),<ref>[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration], By Malia Politzer, ''Migration Information Source'', August 2008.</ref> white [[Whites in Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean]],<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0502/p04s01-woaf.html Why white Zimbabwean farmers plan to stay in Nigeria], By Sarah Simpson, csmonitor.com, May 2, 2008.</ref> Japanese, Greek, [[Syria]]n and Lebanese immigrants in Nigeria. Immigrants also include those from other [[West Africa]]n or [[East Africa]]n nations. These minorities mostly reside in major cities such as [[Lagos]] and [[Abuja]], or in the [[Niger Delta]] as employees for the major oil companies. A number of [[Cuba]]ns settled in Nigeria as political refugees following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. 

In the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of ex-slaves of [[Afro-Cuban]] and [[Afro-Brazilian]] descent<ref>Toyin Falola; The History of Nigeria, Greenwood Press, 1999. pp. 41,47.</ref> and emigrants from [[Sierra Leone]] established communities in Lagos and other regions of Nigeria. Many ex-slaves came to Nigeria following the emancipation of slaves in the [[Americas]]. Many of the immigrants, sometimes called Saros (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from Brazil)<ref>Abiola Dosumu Elegbede-Fernandez, Lagos A Legacy of Honour. Spectrum Books, 1992. pp. 19,27.</ref> later became prominent merchants and [[missionaries]] in these cities.

=== Language ===
[[File:Nigeria Benin Cameroon languages.png|thumb|350px|Linguistic map of Nigeria, Cameroon, and Benin]]
{{Main|Languages of Nigeria}}
The number of languages currently estimated and catalogued in Nigeria is 521. This number includes 510 living languages, two second languages without native speakers and nine extinct languages. In some areas of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country. The choice of [[English_language|English]] as the official language was partially related to the fact that a part of the Nigerian population spoke English as a result of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonization]] that ended in 1960.

The major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[African languages]] <U+2013> the majority are [[Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], the [[Hausa language]] is [[Afro-Asiatic]]; and [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily [[Borno State]], is a member of the [[Nilo-Saharan|Nilo-Saharan family]]. Even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English, being the official language, is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language, however, remains an exclusive preserve of a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. With the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardized languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as '[[Pidgin]]' or 'Broken' (Broken English), is also a popular lingua franca, though with varying regional influences on dialect and [[slang]]. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominately in [[Warri]], [[Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], Agenebode, and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |date=2003 |isbn=1-592-21173-9 |page=55 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref>

=== Literature ===
[[File:Things Fall Apart books 02.jpg|thumb|''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by [[Chinua Achebe]] is Nigeria's most popular and best selling literary piece ever, translated into over 40 languages<ref>[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=16&art_id=63036&sid=18059567&con_type=3&d_str=&fc=10 The Standard] on Chinua Achebe: "That Things Fall Apart, published in 1958, would sell about 11 million copies in about 45 languages?" (14 March 2008)</ref>]]
{{See also|Nigerian literature}}
Nigerian citizens have authored many influential works of [[post-colonial theory|post-colonial]] literature in the English language. Nigeria's best-known writers are [[Wole Soyinka]], the first African [[Nobel Laureate in Literature]], and [[Chinua Achebe]], best known for the novel, ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' and his controversial critique of [[Joseph Conrad]]. Other Nigerian [[List of Nigerian writers|writers]] and [[List of Nigerian poets|poets]] who are well known internationally include [[John Pepper Clark]], [[Ben Okri]], [[Cyprian Ekwensi]], [[Buchi Emecheta]], [[Helon Habila]], [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]], and [[Ken Saro Wiwa]], who was executed in 1995 by the military regime. Nigeria has the second largest newspaper market in Africa (after Egypt) with an estimated circulation of several million copies daily in 2003.

=== Music and film ===
{{See also|Music of Nigeria|Cinema of Nigeria}}
Nigeria has been called "the heart of [[music of Africa|African music]]"{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} because of its role in the development of West African [[highlife]] and [[palm-wine music]], which fuses native rhythms with techniques imported from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Brazil]], [[Cuba]] and elsewhere.

Many late 20th century musicians such as [[Fela Kuti]] have famously fused cultural elements of various [[indigenous music]] with American [[Jazz]] and [[Soul music|Soul]] to form [[Afrobeat]].<ref name=>''Adams, S. Black President: The Art and Legacy of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, New York; This Is Lagos: Yabis Night, Music and Fela: Skoto Gallery, New York, New York [Exhibit].

There is also [[fuji music]], a [[Yoruba Culture|Yoruba]] [[percussion instrument|percussion]] style, created and popularized by Mr. Fuji, [[Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]].

There is a budding [[Nigerian hip hop|hip hop]] movement in Nigeria. [[Kennis Music]], the self proclaimed "No 1 Record Label in Africa" and one of Nigeria's biggest record labels, has a roster almost entirely dominated by [[Nigerian hip hop|hip hop]] artists.

Some famous musicians that come from Nigeria are [[Fela Kuti]], [[Adewale Ayuba]], [[Ezebuiro Obinna]], [[Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister]], [[King Sunny Ad<U+00E9>]], [[Ebenezer Obey]], [[Femi Kuti]], [[Lagbaja]], [[Dr. Alban]], [[Sade Adu]], Wasiu Alabi, [[Bola Abimbola]] and [[Tuface|Tuface Idibia]].

In November 2008, Nigeria's music scene (and that of Africa) received international attention when [[MTV]] hosted the continent's first African music awards show in Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/11/22/MTV.Africa.ap/index.html |title=AP/CNN: MTV launches first-ever African music award show |publisher=CNN.com |date= 2008-11-22 |accessdate=2008-11-26}}</ref>

The Nigerian film industry is known as [[Nollywood]]. Many of the [[film studio]]s are based in Lagos and [[Enugu]] and the industry is now a very lucrative income for these cities.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}
[[File:AbujaNationalMosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Abuja National Mosque]]]]
Nigeria is home to a variety of religions which tend to vary regionally. This situation accentuates regional and ethnic distinctions and has often been seen as a source of sectarian conflict amongst the population.<ref>Osita Agbu; Ethnic Militias and the Threat to Democracy in Post-Transition Nigeria, Nordic African Institute, 2004, p. 6.</ref> The largest religions of Nigeria are [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]],<ref name=statereport/> including few followers of indigenous religions. Based on a 2003 survey, 50.5% were Muslim, 48.2% were Christian (15% [[Protestant]], 13.7% [[Catholic]], and 19.6% other Christian), and followers of other religions were 1.4%.<ref>[http://pewforum.org/world-affairs/countries/?CountryID=150#2 Religious Demographic Profile - Nigeria] Pew Forum (Pew Research Center). Retrieved on 2010-01-04.</ref> The north is predominantly Muslim, there are large numbers of both Muslims and Christians in in the Middle Belt, including the Federal Capital Territory. In the southwest, Christians and Muslims reside equally, southern regions are predominantly Christian, in the east, Catholics, Anglicans, and Methodists are the majority with few traditional beliefs, while the Niger Delta region is mainly Christian.<ref name=statereport>[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127249.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2009 - Nigeria] U.S. Department of State.</ref> 

The majority of Nigerian Muslims are [[Sunni]] (95%), but a significant [[Shia]] minority exists (''see [[Shia in Nigeria]]''). Some northern states have incorporated [[Sharia]] law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy.<ref name=tiptoe>''Owobi Angrew, Tiptoeing Through A Constitutional Minefield: The Great Sharia Controversy in Nigeria, Journal Of African law, Vol 48, No 2, 2002.''</ref> [[Kano State]] has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution.<ref> [http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=15994&sec=36&cont=3 "Kano Seeks Supremacy of Sharia Over Constitution"], wwrn.org, Accessed May 19, 2007.</ref> 

Christian Nigerians are about evenly split between [[Roman Catholic]]ism and [[Protestantism]]. Leading Protestant churches are the [[Church of Nigeria]], of the [[Anglican]] communion, and the [[Nigerian Baptist Convention]]. The Yoruba area contains a large Anglican population, while Igboland is predominantly Catholic.

Across Yorubaland in the west many people are adherents to Yorubo/Irunmole spirituality with its philosophy of divine destiny that all can become [[Orisha]] (''ori'', spiritual head; ''sha'', is chosen: to be one with Olodumare (''oni odu'', the God source of all energy; ''ma re'', enlighthens / triumphs).

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of Nigeria}}
Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, is known for its richness and variety. Many different [[spice]]s, [[herb]]s and flavourings are used in conjunction with [[palm oil]] or [[peanut|groundnut]] oil to create deeply flavoured sauces and soups often made very hot with [[chili pepper]]s. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.<ref>H.O. Anthonio & M. Isoun: "Nigerian Cookbook". Macmillan, Lagos, 1982.</ref>

=== Sport ===
[[File:Nigerian vs Ghana football.jpg|right|thumb|Nigerian fans at a football match between Nigeria and Cote d'Ivoire.]]
{{Main|Football in Nigeria}}
[[Soccer|football (soccer)]] is Nigeria's national sport and the country has its own [[Nigerian Premier League|Premier League]] of football. Nigeria's [[Nigerian national football team|national football team]], known as the Super Eagles, has made the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] on three occasions [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], won the African Cup of Nations in [[1980 African Cup of Nations|1980]] and [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]], and also hosted the Junior World Cup. They won the gold medal for football in the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] (in which they beat Argentina) and have reached the finals of the U-20 World Championship in 2005. In September 2007, Nigeria won the U-17 World cup for the third time, becoming the first African nation to have achieved that feat and the second nation (after Brazil) to do so. Nigeria had previously won the very first U-17 tournament in 1985 (China '85), 1993 (Japan '93) and in 2007 (Korea '07).

The nation's cadet team to Japan '93 produced some of the world's finest players notably [[Nwankwo Kanu]], a two-time African Footballer of the year who won the European [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] with Ajax Amsterdam and later played with [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] (Italy), [[Arsenal FC]] (London, UK), [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] (UK) and [[Portsmouth F.C.]] (UK). Other players that graduated from the Junior teams are [[Celestine Babayaro]] (of [[Newcastle United]], UK), [[Wilson Oruma]] and [[Taye Taiwo]] (of Marseille, France).

According to the official September 2007 [[FIFA World Rankings]], Nigeria was the top-ranked football nation in Africa and the 19th highest in the world. Nigeria is also involved in other sports such as [[basketball]], [[cricket (sport)|cricket]] and [[track and field]].<ref>AFRICABASKET, [http://www.africabasket.com/ngr/ngr.asp "Nigerian Basketball"], Africabasket.com, Accessed April 29, 2007.</ref> Boxing is also an important sport in Nigeria; [[Dick Tiger]] and [[Samuel Peter]] are both former World Champions.

== Societal issues ==
Despite its vast government revenue from the mining of petroleum, Nigeria is faced by a number of societal issues due primarily to a history of inefficiency in its governance.

=== Human rights ===
{{Main|Human rights in Nigeria}}

=== Strife and sectarian violence ===
{{See also|Conflict in the Niger Delta}}
{{See also|Nigerian sectarian violence}}
Because of its multitude of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria prior to independence has been faced with sectarian tensions and violence. This is particularly a major issue in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic groups like the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]], have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.

Since the end of the civil war in 1970, some ethnic violence has persisted. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country.

In 2002, organizers of the [[Miss World|Miss World Pageant]] were forced to move the pageant from the Nigerian capital, [[Abuja]], to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100&nbsp;people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to comments made by a newspaper reporter. Rioters in [[Kaduna]] killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.

=== Health issues ===
{{See|Health care in Nigeria}}
Nigeria has been reorganizing its health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees.<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.eldis.org/healthsystems/userfees/background.htm
|title=User fees for health: a background
|publisher=
|accessdate=2006-12-28 
}}</ref> The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.
A comprehensive approach strategy was extended to all areas of health care, with subsequent improvement in the health care indicators and improvement in health care efficiency and cost.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Effect of the Bamako-Initiative drug revolving fund on availability and rational use of essential drugs in primary health care facilities in south-east Nigeria
|publisher=
|accessdate=2006-12-28
}}</ref>

The Nigerian health care system is continuously faced with a shortage of doctors known as '[[brain drain]]' due to the fact that many highly skilled Nigerian doctors emigrate to North America and Europe. In 1995, It was estimated that 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practicing in the United States alone, which about the same as the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as one of the goals of the government.<ref>[http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/barticles/brain_drain_the_nigerian_experie.htm Mike Chinedu Anekwe: "Brain Drain: The Nigerian Experience."] ''Niger Delta Congress'' website accessed April 8, 2007.</ref>

=== Education ===
{{Main|Education in Nigeria}}
[[File:Nigeria students.jpg|Children at school in [[Ile-Ife]], Nigeria|thumb]]
Nigeria provides free, government-supported education, but attendance is not compulsory at any level, and certain groups, such as nomads and the handicapped, are under-served. The education system consists of six years of primary school, three years of junior secondary school, three years of senior secondary school, and four years of university education leading to a bachelor<U+2019>s degree. The rate of secondary school attendance is 32 percent for males and 27 percent for females. In 2004 the Nigerian National Planning Commission described the country<U+2019>s education system as <U+201C>dysfunctional.<U+201D> Reasons for this characterization included decaying institutions and ill-prepared graduates.<ref name=cp>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Nigeria.pdf Nigeria country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (June 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>

=== Happiness survey ===
In 2003, Nigerians were reported to be the happiest people in a scientific survey carried out in 65 nations in 1999<U+2013>2001.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3157570.stm BBC: ''Nigeria tops happiness survey''], Thursday, October 2, 2003. Website accessed March 26, 2007.</ref> The research was reported by one of the world's top science magazines, ''[[New Scientist]]'', and was picked up by a number of news outlets. See [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3157570.stm ''Nigeria tops happiness survey''.] The report considered that the country's family life and culture were more important than its problems and material wealth in determining happiness.

=== Crime ===
{{Main|Advance fee fraud}}
Nigeria is infamous for a crime dubbed ''419'', a type of [[advance fee fraud]] (named after Section 419 of the Nigerian Penal Code) along with the "[[Nigerian scam]]", a form of [[confidence trick]] practiced by individuals and criminal syndicates. The confidence trickster persuades the target to advance relatively small sums of money (the advance fee) in the hope of realizing a much larger gain (usually touted as millions).<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20050115001333/http://www.haverford.edu/pols/faculty/glickman/Articles/CJAS_Text_final_1-35.pdf</ref> In 2003, the Nigerian [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (or EFCC) was created to combat this and other forms of organized financial crime.<ref>http://www.efccnigeria.org</ref> It has succeeded in bringing several "419" [[crime boss]]es to justice and in some cases has been able to return the stolen money to victims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efccnigeria.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=686&Itemid=2 |title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission <U+2013> EFCC |publisher=Efccnigeria.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref>
