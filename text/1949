'''Basilios''' (or '''Basilius''') '''Bessarion''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] <U+0392><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0392><U+03B7><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03C9><U+03BD>) (January 2, 1403 <U+2013> November 18, 1472), a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal Bishop]] and the titular [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]], was one of the illustrious Greek scholars who contributed to the great revival of letters in the 15th century. He has been mistakenly known also as '''Johannes Bessarion''' due to an erroneous interpretation of [[Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople| Gregory III Mammas]].

==Biography==
He was born at [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], an Anatolian Black Sea port. The year of his birth has been given as 1389, 1395 or 1403.

He was educated at [[Constantinople]], and went in 1423 to the [[Peloponnese]] to hear [[Gemistus Pletho]] expound the philosophy of [[Plato]]. On being tonsured monk, he adopted the name of an old Egyptian [[anchorite]] Bessarion, whose story he has related. In 1437, he was made metropolitan of [[Nicaea (city)|Nicaea]] by the Byzantine Emperor [[John VIII Palaeologus]], whom he accompanied to [[Italy]] in order to bring about a reunion between the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] churches. They had been separated since the [[East-West Schism|Schism]] of 1054, but the emperor hoped to use the possibility of re-uniting the churches to obtain help from Western Europe against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].

Upon his return to Greece, he found himself bitterly resented for his attachment to the minority party that saw no difficulty in a reconciliation of the two churches. At the [[Council of Florence]], held in [[Ferrara]] (1438) and then [[Florence]] (1439-1445), Bessarion supported the Roman church and gained the favour of [[Pope Eugene IV]], who invested him with the rank of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] at a [[consistory]] of 18 December 1439.

From that time, he resided permanently in Italy, doing much, by his patronage of learned men, by his collection of books and manuscripts, and by his own writings, to spread abroad the [[new learning]]. His [[palazzo]] in Rome was a virtual [[Academy]] for the studies of new [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic learning]], a center for learned Greeks and Greek refugees, whom he supported by commissioning transcripts of Greek manuscripts and translations into Latin that made Greek scholarship available to Western Europeans. He supported [[Regiomontanus]] in this fashion and defended [[Nicholas of Cusa]]. He is known in history as the original patron of the Greek exiles (scholars and diplomats) including [[Theodore Gaza]], [[George of Trebizond]], [[John Argyropoulos]] and many others.

He held in succession the [[archbishopric of Siponto]] and the [[suburbicarian see]]s of [[see of Sabina|Sabina]] and [[Frascati]]. At the [[papal conclave, 1455|papal conclave of 1455]] which elected the Aragonese candidate, Alfons de Borja, as [[Callixtus III]], Cardinal Bassarion was an early candidate for his disinterest in the competition between Roman factions that pressed candidates of the [[Orsini]] and [[Colonna]] factions. He was opposed for his Greek background by the French Cardinal [[Alain de Co<U+00EB>tivy]]. "It is probable that the cardinals were less afraid of his Greek training and temperament than they were of his known austerity and passion for reform", Francis A. Burkle-Young has observed.

In 1463, his fellow humanist Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini, then [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], gave him the purely ceremonial title of [[Latin Patriarch of Constantinople]]. As [[Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals]] (from April 1463), he presided over the [[Papal conclave, 1464]] and [[Papal conclave, 1471]]. For five years (1450-1455), he was [[papal legate|legate]] at [[Bologna]], and he was engaged on embassies to many foreign princes, among others to [[Louis XI of France]] in 1471. Vexation at an insult offered him by Louis is said to have hastened his death, which took place on November 19, 1472, at [[Ravenna]]. He is buried in the [[Santi Apostoli|Church of Twelve Apostles]] in [[Rome]].

==Works==
Bessarion was one of the most learned scholars of his time. Besides his translations of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Metaphysics'' and [[Xenophon]]'s ''Memorabilia'', his most important work is a treatise directed against [[George of Trebizond]], a vehement Aristotelian who had written a polemic against [[Plato]], which was entitled ''In Calumniatorem Platonis'' ("Against the Slanderer of Plato"). Bessarion, though a Platonist, was not so thoroughgoing in his admiration as [[Gemistus Pletho]], and he strove instead to reconcile the two philosophies. His work, by opening up the relations of [[Platonism]] to the main questions of religion, contributed greatly to the extension of speculative thought in the department of [[theology]].

His library, which contained a very extensive collection of Greek manuscripts, was presented by him in 1468 to the senate of [[Venice]], and forms the nucleus of the famous library of St Mark's, the ''[[Biblioteca Marciana]]''.

Most of Bessarion's works are in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]], ''[[Patrologia Graeca]]'', vol. 161.
