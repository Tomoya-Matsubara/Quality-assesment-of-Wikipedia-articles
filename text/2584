The '''SG Egelsbach''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[football (soccer)|football]] [[:Category:German football clubs|club]] from the city of [[Egelsbach]], [[Hesse]].

==History==
The club was formed after the [[Second World War]] in 1945 when four local sports associations merged, the ''FC Egelsbach 1903, TV 1874 Egelsbach'', ''TG 1885 Egelsbach'' and the ''Arbeiter-Radfahrverein 1905''. Through the ''TV 1874'', which was formed on 15 August 1874, the current club claims its foundation date within the clubs name.<ref>[http://www.sgegelsbach.de/verein/geschichte.php SG Egelsbach website] {{de icon}} accessed: [[18 October]] [[2008]]</ref> Like in most other towns and cities within the US occupation zone, only one sports club was permitted to exist. The new ''SGE'' was heavily based on the pre-1933 workers clubs, which had been outlawed by the [[Nazis]]. But unlike most other places, where, after the liberlisation of occupation laws, the old sport associations re-surfaced, in Egelsbach the merger of the four formerly separate clubs endured.<ref>[http://www.sgegelsbach.de/verein/geschichte.php?ckey=sge_h05 SG Egelsbach website - Die Gr<U+00FC>ndung] {{de icon}} accessed: [[18 October]] [[2008]]</ref>

For the most part of its history, the club existed as a minor local amateur side. The ''SGE'' first rose to attention when it earned promotion to the ''[[Landesliga Hessen-S<U+00FC>d]]'' (IV) in 1974. After a couple of good seasons in this league, a championship was won in 1979 and the ''SGE'' entered the ''[[Oberliga Hessen]]'' for the first time. Before that, in 1976, the club managed for the first time to qulify for the [[German Cup]]. In the [[DFB Cup 1976-77]], it beat the [[1. FC M<U+00FC>lheim]] 0-3 in the first round<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/sg-egelsbach/1-fc-muelheim/11/ SG Egelsbach .:. Die Bilanz gegen 1. FC M<U+00FC>lheim] Weltfussball.de  {{de icon}}, accessed: 18 October 2008</ref> before falling to the [[VfL Osnabr<U+00FC>ck]] 0-2 in the next round.<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/sg-egelsbach/vfl-osnabrueck/11/ SG Egelsbach .:. Die Bilanz gegen VfL Osnabr<U+00FC>ck] Weltfussball.de {{de icon}} accessed: 18 October 2008</ref>

The club only lasted for two seasons in this league before returning to the ''Landesliga'' in 1981. Another decent cup run in the [[DFB Cup 1980-81]] saw the team again reach the second round. After defeating the [[TuS Neuendorf]] 3-4 in extra time<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/sg-egelsbach/tus-koblenz/11/ SG Egelsbach .:. Die Bilanz gegen TuS Koblenz] Weltfussball.de {{de icon}} accessed: 18 October 2008</ref>, the [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]] ended their run in round two<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/sg-egelsbach/1-fc-kaiserslautern/11/ SG Egelsbach .:. Die Bilanz gegen 1. FC Kaiserslautern] Weltfussball.de {{de icon}}, accessed: 18 October 2008</ref>. A runners-up spot in 1985 was the highlight of the following ''Landesliga'' seasons, before another league championship in 1989 earned it the return to the ''Oberliga''. Immediate relegation from this league was followed by another ''Landesliga'' championship and another return to the highest league in the state of Hesse.

The following three seasons saw the ''SGE'' do rather well, finishing fourth each year and subsequently earning entry to the new ''[[Regionalliga S<U+00FC>d]]'' in 1994. 

In this league, the club was never more then a struggler and being able to survive for three seasons was certainly a success in itself. Eventually, however, relegation could not be avoided and in 1997 the team went back to the ''Oberliga''. The adventure ''Regionalliga'' however had cost the club dearly in financial terms and almost send it broke.<ref>[http://www.sgegelsbach.de/verein/geschichte.php?ckey=sge_h07 SG Egelsbach website - Wachstum und Reife] {{de icon}} accessed: [[18 October]] [[2008]]</ref> A third appearance in the German Cup in 1994 did not change this all that much. Another loss to Kaiserslautern, this time in round one, was nevertheless quite honorable with a 0-2 result<ref>[http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/sg-egelsbach/1-fc-kaiserslautern/11/ SG Egelsbach .:. Die Bilanz gegen 1. FC Kaiserslautern] {{de icon}} Weltfussball.de accessed: 18 October 2008</ref>. 

Back in the ''Oberliga Hessen'', the ''SGE'' finished a respectable seventh but a two-point deduction combined with the financial repercussions of semi-professional football forced the club in 1998 to downgrade its ambitions.<ref>''Saison Statistik 1997/98'', Yearbook of German amateur football, publisher: DSFS, published: 1998, page: 28, accessed: 18 October 2008</ref>

The club stepped down to the ''Bezirksoberliga Darmstadt'' (VI) for the 1998-99 season.

After a fall to as far as the ''Kreisliga A-West Offenbach'' (VIII), the club returned to the ''Bezirksliga Frankfurt/Offenbach'' (VII) in 2003. After the 2007-08 season, the Hesse FA overhauled its league system, renaming the ''Bezirksliga'' to ''Kreisoberliga''.

===Current===
In 2008-09, the club had a bad start, sitting on last place in its league, the ''Kreisoberliga Gruppe Offenbach'', with no win after eleven games.<ref>[http://www.fussball.de/fussball/servlet/content/72?next=%2F0809%2F013%2F042%2F204%2F340030&tag=50001 Kreisoberliga Gruppe Offenbach 2008-09] accessed: 18 October 2008</ref>
