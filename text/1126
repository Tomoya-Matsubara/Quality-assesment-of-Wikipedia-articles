'''Hurricane Bridget''' was one of the worst hurricanes to strike the Mexican city of [[Acapulco]]. It formed on June 14 as a tropical depression, which is a minimal [[tropical cyclone]] with winds less than [[gale]] force. However, it was soon upgraded to a tropical storm, and Bridget steadily intensified to become a hurricane on June&nbsp;15. After peaking at Category 2 intensity, it weakened to a tropical storm on June 17, then made landfall in [[Mexico]]. Hours later, however, it turned offshore as a tropical depression. Bridget dissipated on June 20 after leaving heavy damage and 17&nbsp;deaths in the Acapulco area. 

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Bridget 1971 track.png}}
The origins of the hurricane were from a [[tropical wave]] that exited the coast of Africa on June&nbsp;3. Around four days later the system entered the Caribbean Sea, passing over the [[Archipelago of San Andr<U+00E9>s, Providencia and Santa Catalina|San Andres]] islands on June&nbsp;12.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Neil L.

This allowed for steady intensification as it tracked through the [[Gulf of Tehuantepec]].<ref name="mwr"/>

Early on June&nbsp;15, a ship reported winds of 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h) and {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} seas, which prompted the [[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]] (EPHC) to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Bridget. The storm maintained a general northwest track toward the southwest Mexican coastline. It gradually intensified, and satellite images late on June&nbsp;16 indicated that Bridget attained hurricane status about 55&nbsp;mi (95&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Puerto <U+00C1>ngel]], [[Oaxaca]].<ref name="mwr"/> It quickly intensified as it neared the coast, reaching winds of 100&nbsp;mph (155&nbsp;km/h) just southwest of [[Acapulco]] coastline before weakening.{{EPAC hurricane best track}} Bridget paralleled the Mexican coastline just offshore before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] at 1200&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on June&nbsp;17, about 100&nbsp;mi (160&nbsp;km) southeast of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Colima]]. The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain, emerging into the Pacific Ocean as a tropical depression after being over land for only a few hours.<ref name="mwr"/> Bridget turned westward as a weak tropical cyclone, eventually dissipating on June&nbsp;20 to the south of the [[Baja California peninsula]].{{EPAC hurricane best track}}

==Preparations and impact==
While passing to the southwest of Acapulco, Bridget produced heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts reaching 104&nbsp;mph (167&nbsp;km/h). The winds damaged or destroyed many roofs across Acapulco, signs, and windows.<ref name="mwr"/> Strong winds also downed trees and power lines, which left most of Acapulco without electricity.<ref name="re">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=United Press International|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=1971-06-17|title=Storm Causes Damage|accessdate=2011-07-21|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3WVYAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7PcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2549,3439290&dq=hurricane&hl=en}}</ref> Along the coast, the hurricane produced high tides and waves which flooded low-lying coastal areas with around {{convert|1.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water.<ref name="mwr"/><ref name="mis">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|title=Mexican Storm Leaves 17 Lost|accessdate=2011-07-21|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N0UaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cCkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6603,3723536&dq=acapulco+storm&hl=en}}</ref> The high tides damaged coastal properties and destroyed 21&nbsp;boats, including the [[flagship]] of the [[Admiral of the Navy|Admiral]] of the [[Mexican Navy]].<ref name="mwr"/> Debris-clogged drains caused drainage facilities to exceed their capacities following the heavy rainfall.<ref name="mwr"/> Overall, the storm killed 17&nbsp;people in the region,<ref>{{cite web|author=Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance|title=Significant Data on Major Disasters Worldwide 1990-present|date=August 1993|accessdate=2009-03-25|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNABP986.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> and caused five additional injuries.<ref name="re"/> 

Damage in the area around Acapulco was estimated at around 500&nbsp;million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] ($40&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]]). This made it the worst hurricane to hit the city in at least 25&nbsp;years. Where Bridget made its final landfall, no damage reports were available due to the sparse population of the area.<ref name="mwr"/>
