'''HMAS ''Adelaide'' (FFG 01)''' was the [[lead ship]] of the [[Adelaide class frigate|''Adelaide'' class]] of guided missile frigates built for the [[Royal Australian Navy]], based on the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' class]] frigates. She was built in the United States of America and commissioned into the RAN in 1980.

During her career, ''Adelaide'' was part of Australian responses or contributions to the [[1987 Fijian coups d'<U+00E9>tat]], the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraq invasion of Kuwait]], the [[Indonesian riots of May 1998]], the [[INTERFET]] peacekeeping taskforce, the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States-led invasion of Iraq]]. In 1997, the frigate rescued two competitors in the [[Vendee Globe#1996-1997|1996<U+2013>97 Vendee Globe]] solo, round-the-world yacht race. In 2001, a boat carrying suspected illegal immigrants was intercepted by ''Adelaide''; the events of this interception became the centre of the [[Children overboard affair]].

In 2008, ''Adelaide'' was the second ship of the class to be decommissioned, in order to offset the cost of an upgrade to the other four vessels. This ship was to be sunk off [[Avoca Beach, New South Wales]] as a [[Sinking ships for wreck diving sites|dive wreck]] on 27 March 2010, until an appeal to the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]] by protest groups led to a postponement of the scuttling until additional cleanup work was completed. Despite further attempts to delay or cancel the [[scuttling]], ''Adelaide'' was sunk off Avoca on 13 April 2011.

==Design and construction==
Following the cancellation of the [[Australian light destroyer project|DDL project]] in 1973, the RAN needed to procure a replacement for the [[Daring class destroyer (1949)|''Daring'' class]] destroyers.<ref name=Jones220>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 220</ref> Foreign designs were considered, with two designs shortlisted: the [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' class]] guided missile frigate, and the [[Type 42 destroyer|Type 42]] destroyer, modified to fire [[RIM-66 Standard]] missiles.<ref name=Jones220/> Although the ''Perry'' design did not meet the operating conditions set down for the DDL, the impracticality of modifying the Type 42 design prompted the Australian government to approve the acquisition of two ''Perry'' class ships: HMA Ships ''Adelaide'' and {{HMAS|Canberra|FFG 02|2}}.<ref name=Jones220/>

The order was placed with [[Todd Pacific Shipyards]] at [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] in February 1976.<ref name=Jones220/> ''Adelaide'' was laid down to the ''Perry'' class' Flight I design on 29 July 1977, launched on 21 June 1978, and commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Navy]] on 15 November 1980.<ref name=Hooton>Hooton, ''Perking-up the Perry class''</ref><ref name=RAN/><ref name=NelsonPR>Nelson, ''Warship to be sunk off New South Wales coast'' [press release]</ref><ref>''No Name (FFG 17)'', United States Navy</ref> The frigate ran aground off Seattle in early 1981, during post-commissioning trials, but was freed with only minor damage.<ref name=Westbrook/> During construction, she was identified with the United States Navy [[hull classification symbol|hull number]] FFG-17.<ref name=Hooton/> A total of four ''Adelaide'' class ships were constructed by Todd Pacific, with a further two built by Australian shipbuilder [[AMECON]].<ref name=Jones220/>

===Armament===
''Adelaide''{{'}}s main weapon is the Mark 13 missile launcher located on the foredeck: this is used to fire both [[Harpoon missile|Harpoon]] and [[RIM-66 Standard|SM-1MR Standard]] missiles.<ref name=RAN/> A [[76 mm OTO Melara|{{convert|76|mm|in|adj=on}} Mark 75 OTO Melara gun]] is located on top of the superstructure, in front of the exhaust funnel.<ref name=RAN>''HMAS Adelaide (II)'', Royal Australian Navy</ref><ref name=Jonesopp224>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', opp. p. 224</ref> A triple-barrelled [[Mark 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes|Mark 32 torpedo tube set]] is fitted to each side of the superstructure.<ref name=RAN/><ref name=Jonesopp224/> For close defence, a {{convert|20|mm|in|adj=on}} Mark 16 Mod 2 [[Phalanx CIWS]] sits at the aft end of the superstructure, above the frigate's two helicopter hangars.<ref name=RAN/><ref name=Jonesopp224/>
[[File:HMAS Adelaide FFG01 Mk13 missile launcher loading part 3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Close up of a naval missile launcher. A blue missile with white fins has been loaded.|''Adelaide''{{'}}s Mark 13 launcher, with a dummy Standard missile loaded]]

The hangars housed two [[SH-60 Seahawk|S-70B Seahawk]] helicopters from the 1990s onwards; before these were acquired by the RAN, ''Adelaide'' operated a [[Bell Kiowa]], then an [[AS350B Squirrel]].<ref name=RAN/><ref>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 247<U+2013>8</ref>

==Operational history==
Following the decommissioning of the aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}} in 1982 and the disbandment of fixed-wing aviation squadrons in 1984, the RAN [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] became focused on helicopter operations, but had minimal experience flying helicopters from small ships.<ref name=Jones247>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 247</ref> To remedy this, a [[Bell Kiowa]] was embarked aboard ''Adelaide'' during 1984.<ref name=Jones247/> 

In May 1987, ''Adelaide'' visited Fiji, and was alongside in [[Lautoka]] when the first of the [[1987 Fijian coups d'<U+00E9>tat]] occurred on 14 May.<ref name=Jones260>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 260</ref> ''Adelaide'' and sister ship {{HMAS|Sydney|FFG 03|2}}, alongside in Suva, were instructed to remain off Fiji to aid in any necessary evacuation of Australian citizens; the first component of what became [[Operation Morris Dance]].<ref name=Jones260/> ''Adelaide'' remained on station until at least 29 May, when a phased withdrawal began.<ref name=Jones260/>

On 3 July 1990, ''Adelaide'' became the first Australian warship to visit [[Tahiti]] since 1970.<ref name=Bendle6>Bendle et. al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990<U+2013>2005'', p. 6</ref> On 10 August, ''Adelaide'', sister ship {{HMAS|Darwin|FFG 04|2}}, and the replenishment ship {{HMAS|Success|AOR 304|2}} were deployed to the [[Middle East]] as part of [[Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War|Operation Damask]], Australia's participation in the international coalition enforcing [[Iraq sanctions|sanctions against Iraq]] following that nation's [[invasion of Kuwait]].<ref name=Jones261>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 261</ref> ''Adelaide'' and ''Darwin'' remained in the area until 3 December, and was used for surveillance and boarding operations.<ref name=Bendle6/><ref name=Jones263>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 263</ref>

[[File:HMAS Adelaide 1982.jpg|thumb|alt=Adelaide travelling on the open sea|''Adelaide'' underway in 1982]]
In January 1997, the yachts of Thierry Dubois and Tony Bullimore (competitors in the [[Vendee Globe#1996-1997|1996<U+2013>97 Vendee Globe]] solo, round-the-world yacht race), capsized while attempting to cross the Southern Ocean.<ref name=GrazebrookRTW>Grazebrook, ''A Drop in the Ocean?''</ref> ''Adelaide'' successfully found and rescued the sailors after seven days of searching by ships and aircraft.<ref name=GrazebrookRTW/> During late May and early June, the frigate was deployed to the [[Philippines]], and represented Australia at the Philippines Centenary International Naval Review.<ref>Bendle et. al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990<U+2013>2005'', p. 28</ref>

Between 17 and 27 May 1998, ''Adelaide'' was one of four RAN ships placed on standby, in case Australian citizens required evacuation if the [[Indonesian riots of May 1998]] escalated.<ref>Bendle et. al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990<U+2013>2005'', p. 34</ref> The ships were not used. Starting in September, the frigate accompanied the destroyers {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|2}} and {{HMAS|Brisbane|D 41|2}} on a cruise through South East Asia.<ref name=Bendle35>Bendle et. al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990<U+2013>2005'', p. 35</ref> During this deployment, the ships were present at a [[naval review]] by Indonesian president [[Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie]].<ref name=Bendle35/>

In February 1999, ''Adelaide'' was awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]], awarded to the most efficient ship in the RAN during the previous year.<ref>''Adelaide's pair of cups'', in ''Navy News''</ref> The frigate was deployed to [[East Timor]] as part of the Australian-led [[INTERFET]] peacekeeping taskforce from 19 September to 19 October.<ref>Stevens, ''Strength Through Diversity'', p. 15</ref>

On 6 October 2001, ''Adelaide'' was the ship which intercepted [[Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel|SIEV]] 4, the event which sparked the [[Children overboard affair]].<ref name=Senate>Senate Select Committee, ''A Certain Maritime Incident''</ref> Under orders to prevent SIEVs from entering Australian waters, ''Adelaide'' attempted to warn the craft, carrying over 200 passengers (including children), against crossing from international waters during the night and into 7 October. When the SIEV failed to heed these warnings, ''Adelaide'' fired warning shots and initiated a [[RHIB]] boarding action, with the boarding party took control of the craft that afternoon.<ref name=Senate/> Between this time and when the craft was manoeuvred from Australian territory late the next morning, several attempts were made to sabotage the craft, and some adult passengers jumped or were thrown overboard while others threatened to do so; the fourteen people that entered the water were recovered by the frigate's RHIB and taken back to the SIEV.<ref name=Senate/> ''Adelaide'' observed the craft as it headed towards Indonesia, and moved in to provide further assistance a few hours later, after systematic sabotage immobilised the small vessel.<ref name=Senate/> ''Adelaide'' was instructed to take the vessel in tow and head for [[Christmas Island]].<ref name=Senate/> The SIEV began to take on water during the afternoon of 8&nbsp;October, and despite the appearance that the problem had been rectified, the craft sank without warning at 17:00.<ref name=Senate/> All aboard were forced into the water, and were rescued by personnel from ''Adelaide''.<ref name=Senate/> Reports of the sinking were conflated with information about those who jumped or were thrown overboard the day previous to give the impression that the threat of throwing children overboard had been made or carried out, a story that was later proven false but taken up at the time by the [[Howard government]] during the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]] to support their campaign promises to tighten border controls and immigration.<ref name=Senate/><ref>Senate Select Committee, ''Executive Summary''</ref>

From November 2001 to March 2002, ''Adelaide'' and the amphibious warfare ship {{HMAS|Kanimbla|L 51|2}} were deployed to the Middle East as part of [[Operation Slipper]], the Australian contribution to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]].<ref name=Bendle44>Bendle et. al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990<U+2013>2005'', p. 44</ref> The ships also contributed to the continuing enforcement of the Iraq sanctions.<ref name=Bendle44/> ''Adelaide'' returned to the Middle East from July 2004 to January 2005 as part of [[Operation Catalyst]], the Australian contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|United States-led invasion in 2003]].<ref name=Bendle60>Bendle et. al., ''Database of Royal Australian Navy Operations, 1990<U+2013>2005'', p. 60</ref> During this deployment, in December 2004, several gunboats of the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] attempted to capture a boarding party after it had inspected the freighter MV ''Sham'', which had grounded near the Iraq-Iran maritime boundary.<ref name=GardnerBBC>Gardner, ''Iran 'unable to take Australians{{'}}</ref><ref name=AAP>Australian Associated Press, ''Australians repelled Iranian navy''</ref> After completing their inspection, the boarding party returned to their two [[RHIB]]s, but were approached by an Iranian gunboat.<ref name=GardnerBBC/><ref name=AAP/> The boarding party climbed back aboard ''Sham'', took up defensive positions, and, according to BBC reporter Frank Gardner, "warned [the Iranians] to back off, using what was said to be 'highly colourful language'."<ref name=GardnerBBC/><ref name=AAP/> During the next 45 minutes, four more gunboats arrived, and the stand-off lasted for four hours before the Australians were evacuated by ''Adelaide''{{'}}s [[S-70B Seahawk|Seahawk]] helicopter.<ref name=AAP/> No shots were fired during the incident, and two of the Australians were later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (Australia)|Distinguished Service Medal]] for their conduct during the stand-off.<ref name=AAP/> The [[Australian Defence Force]] did not immediately report the incident to the media, as they felt no need to highlight it, and the attempted capture did not come to light until July 2007, when Gardner wrote about it following the [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|capture of 15 British personnel]] during a similar incident in March 2007.<ref name=GardnerBBC/><ref name=AAP/>

A March 2010 reorganisation of [[battle honours]] awarded to RAN ships saw ''Adelaide'' retroactively honoured for her service with INTERFET ("East Timor 1999") and during the War in Afghanistan ("Persian Gulf 2001<U+2013>02").<ref name=newhonours>Royal Australian Navy, ''Navy Marks 109th Birthday With Historic Changes To Battle Honours''</ref><ref name=honourslist>Royal Australian Navy, ''Royal Australian Navy Ship/Unit Battle Honours''</ref>

==Decommissioning and fate==
''Adelaide'' was originally scheduled to be paid off in November 2006, but delays with the project to [[Adelaide class frigate#FFG Upgrade|upgrade four of ''Adelaide''{{'}}s sister ships]] required that she be kept in service for another fourteen months to minimise the impact on the fleet.<ref name=FishJanes>Fish, ''Australia's Adelaide ends 27 years of service''</ref> ''Adelaide'' was decommissioned on 19 January 2008 at {{HMAS|Stirling||6}}, before she was towed to Sydney and given to the [[New South Wales Government]], which planned to sink her as a [[dive wreck]] off the coast near [[Terrigal, New South Wales|Terrigal]]: the first military ship dive wreck in New South Wales.<ref name=NelsonPR/><ref name=FishJanes/> After spending time alongside at {{HMAS|Kuttabul|naval base|6}}, ''Adelaide'' was towed to [[White Bay, New South Wales|White Bay]] at a point prior to November 2009.<ref name=Collins>Collins, ''HMAS Adelaide was stripped of her mast at White Bay last Thursday''</ref>

[[File:Adelaide pre-scuttling.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Adelaide tied up alongside at a wharf. The majority of her communications and radar masts have been removed, she carries no weapons, and several large squares have been cut into the ship's hull.|''Adelaide'' tied up at White Bay in April 2010, as she awaits the tribunal's decision. The vessel has been prepared for scuttling: weapons and systems have been removed, masts have been cut short, and diver access holes have been prepared.]]
The ship was prepared for scuttling during late 2009 and early 2010: her mast (which would have become a navigational hazard once the ship was scuttled) was removed, dangerous materials and toxins were removed, and access holes were cut in the ship's flanks.<ref name=Collins/><ref name=WestResident>West, ''Scuttled ship would wreck bay: residents''</ref> The ship was scheduled to be sunk on 27 March, {{convert|1.7|km|mi}} offshore from [[Avoca Beach, New South Wales]], in {{convert|32|m|ft}} of water.<ref name=WestResident/> Local [[resident action group]]s campaigned to prevent the scuttling, claiming that the wreck will affect tides and [[littoral drift|littoral sand drift]], and that the removal of chemicals and hazardous materials in the ship has not been thorough enough, with the chance that marine life and people could be poisoned.<ref name=WestResident/><ref name=Trembath>Trembath, ''HMAS Adelaide to sleep with the fishes''</ref>

An appeal by the protest groups to the [[Administrative Appeals Tribunal]] three days before the sinking saw the project placed on hold until the case can be heard in full: supporters and opponents of the dive wreck agreed to participate in [[mediation]] in the meantime.<ref name=ABCcourtorder>ABC News, ''Plans to sink warship scuttled by court order''</ref><ref name=ToveyHarvey>Tovey & Harvey, ''Tribunal scuppers plan to sink ship''</ref> The case was to be heard on 5 May, but was later postponed to July.<ref name=WestJudge>West, ''Judge fires broadside at rush to sink warship''</ref><ref name=WestTests>West, ''New tests ordered for warship toxins''</ref> On 15 September, the Tribunal ruled that scuttling of the ship could go ahead after the removal of any remaining wiring, which may contain [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s, canvas, insulation, and exfoliating red lead paint.<ref name=HarveyWest>Harvey & West, ''Judge orders tough new rules for scuttling''</ref><ref>Australian Associated Press, ''More money sinks with HMAS Adelaide''</ref> The delays caused by the tribunal hearing meant that the original $5.8 million assigned to the scuttling project was expended, and the tribunal hearing, additional cleanup, and berthing fees brought the cost of the scuttling project to $8.5 million.<ref name=HarveyWest/>

[[File:Bye bye adelaide.JPG|thumb|right|''Adelaide'' submerging after the scuttling charges were fired]]
A new scuttling date was announced on 24 February 2011 by NSW Lands Minister [[Tony Kelly (politician)|Tony Kelly]], with ''Adelaide'' scheduled to be sunk on 13 April 2011, after the additional cleaning ordered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was completed in March.<ref name=AAP24feb11>Australian Associated Press, ''Greenies try to scuttle plans to sink HMAS Adelaide''</ref> ''Adelaide'' was towed from Sydney Harbour on the morning of 11 April for the voyage north.<ref>Australian Associated Press, ''Decommissioned HMAS Adelaide towed to sea''</ref> The action group attempted to cancel or delay the sinking of the warship; requesting that the New South Wales [[Ombudsmen in Australia|Ombudsman]] investigate the government's handling of the artificial reef project, filing a summons in the [[Land and Environment Court of New South Wales]] on the afternoon of 12 April, and asking an Aboriginal 'whale caller' to summon [[humpback whale]]s to the planned wreck site.<ref>Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ''HMAS Adelaide en route to final destination''</ref><ref name=McMahon>McMahon, ''Dolphins delay scuttling of HMAS Adelaide''</ref> Despite this, the sinking went ahead just before midday on 13 April, after being delayed by over an hour by a pod of dolphins inside the {{convert|1|km}} exclusion zone.<ref name=McMahon/> After the scuttling charges were fired, ''Adelaide'' submerged within two minutes.<ref name=Westbrook>Westbrook, ''Dolphins frolic, protesters sunk as frigate sent to the bottom''</ref>
