{{nihongo|'''''Kinu'''''|<U+9B3C><U+6012> <U+8EFD><U+5DE1><U+6D0B><U+8266>|Kinu keijun'y<U+014D>kan}} was a [[Nagara class cruiser|''Nagara''-class]] [[light cruiser]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], named after the [[Kinugawa|Kinu River]] in [[Tochigi prefecture]] [[Japan]].

==Background==
''Kinu'' was the fifth vessel completed in the ''Nagara''-class of light cruisers, and like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a [[destroyer]] flotilla.

==Service career==

===Early career===
''Kinu'' was completed on 10 November 1922 at [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]'s [[Kobe]] yards. From 1934 to 1935 it was largely used as a training vessel. As the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] began to escalate, it supported landings of Japanese troops in central and southern [[China]], and patrolled the China coast from 1937 to 1938.

On 20 November 1941, ''Kinu'' was flagship of [[Rear Admiral]] [[Setsuzo Yoshitomi]]'s SubRon 4, based at [[Iwakuni, Yamaguchi]], with SubDiv 18's [[Japanese submarine I-53|''I-53'']], [[Japanese submarine I-54|''I-54'']] and the [[Japanese submarine I-55 (1925)|''I-55'']] and SubDiv 19's [[Japanese submarine I-56|''I-56'']], [[Japanese submarine I-57|''I-57'']] and the [[Japanese submarine I-58|''I-58'']]. It was engaged in covering landings of Japanese forces in the invasion of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] at the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]].

===The Hunt for Force Z===
On 9 December 1941, [[Japanese submarine I-65|''I-65'']] reported sighting of [[Royal Navy]] [[Force Z]] (the Royal Navy [[battleship]] ''[[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS Prince of Wales]]'', [[battlecruiser]] ''[[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS Repulse]]'' and supporting [[destroyer]]s). The report was received by ''Kinu'', [[Japanese cruiser Yura|Yura]] and the 81st Naval Communications Unit in [[Saigon]]. The reception was poor and it took another 90 minutes to decode and relay the message to [[Vice Admiral]] [[Jisaburo Ozawa]] aboard his flagship, [[Japanese cruiser Chokai|''Chokai'']]. However, the ''I-65s'' report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z, throwing the Japanese fleet into confusion. A [[Kawanishi E7K]] "Alf" from ''Kinu'' buzzed ''I-65'', its pilot mistaking her for an enemy submarine. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by [[torpedo bomber]]s of the 22nd Air Flotilla from [[French Indochina|Indochina]].

===Invasion of Malaya and Dutch East Indies===
On 13 December 1941, ''Kinu'' departed [[Camranh Bay]], Indochina with ''Chokai'', [[Japanese cruiser Mogami|''Mogami'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Mikuma|''Mikuma'']] and destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Hatsuyuki|''Hatsuyuki'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Shirayuki|''Shirayuki'']] to provides cover for invasion landing at [[Kuantan]], Malaya, and from 17<U+2013>24 December 1941, to cover landings in [[Brunei]] and [[Miri]], [[Seria]], [[Lutong]] and [[Kuching]] in [[Sarawak]]. The 2500 men of the "Kawaguchi Detachment" and the No. 2 Yokosuka [[Special Naval Landing Force]] (SNLF) quickly capture Miri's airfield and oil fields. The operation was completed, and ''Kinu'' returned to its base at [[Camranh Bay]], Indochina by the end of the year.

From January through March, 1942, ''Kinu'' continued to provide coverage for Japanese landings in Malaya, Sarawak and [[Java]]. On 1 March 1942, ''Kinu<U+2019>s'' convoy was attacked in the [[Java Sea]] {{convert|90|mi|km}} west of [[Surabaya]] by ten obsolete [[Vickers Vildebeest]] [[biplane]] bombers and 15 fighters of the [[RAAF|Australian]] and [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|New Zealand Air Forces]]. ''Kinu'' was slightly damaged by near-misses and three men were killed by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]]. The following day, north of Surabaya, ''Kinu'' was attacked by the [[submarine]] [[USS S-38 (SS-143)|''USS S-38'']], which launched four torpedoes, all of which missed.

From 10 March 1942, ''Kinu'' was assigned to CruDiv 16 and was based at [[Makassar]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]] and then [[Battle of Ambon|Ambon]].

===The New Guinea campaigns===
From 29 March <U+2013> 23 April 1942, ''Kinu'' was assigned to Rear Admiral [[Ruitaro Fujita]]'s "N" Expeditionary Force for the invasion of [[Dutch New Guinea]],  which included the [[seaplane carrier]] [[Japanese aircraft carrier Chitose|''Chitose'']],  destroyers [[Japanese destroyer Yukikaze|''Yukikaze'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Tokitsukaze|''Tokitsukaze'']], torpedo boats ''Tomozuru'', ''Hatsukari'', transports and a Naval Landing Force.<ref>{{cite web|last = Klemen |first = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/new_guinea.html |title= The Fall of Dutch New Guinea, April 1942 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref> Afterwards, for most of the month of May, ''Kinu'' returned to [[Kure, Hiroshima]] for an overhaul. After returning to the southern front, ''Kinu'' was assigned to patrols of the [[Java Sea]] from June through September.

On 13 September 1942, ''Kinu'' embarked the [[2nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|2nd Infantry Division]] at [[Jakarta|Batavia]] with the light cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Isuzu|''Isuzu'']] for the [[Solomon Islands]]. It disembarked the troops at [[Shortland Island]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] on 22 September 1942 and remained on patrol in the [[Timor Sea]] and eastern [[Dutch East Indies]] through January 1943.  

On 21 January 1943, ''Kinu'' was ordered to proceed to Makassar to assist its [[sister ship]], light cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Natori|''Natori'']] which had been damaged by a single [[USAAF]] [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber at [[Ambon Island|Amboina]] harbor on Ambon Island, and escorted the injured cruiser back to Singapore. ''Kinu'' continued to patrol from Makassar through June, with an occasional troop and resupply run to New Guinea.

On 23 June 1943, while at Makassar Roads. ''Kinu'' and [[Japanese cruiser Kuma|''Kuma'']] were anchored at Juliana Quay alongside the [[Japanese cruiser Oi|''Oi'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Kitakami|''Kitakami'']]. The cruisers were attacked by 17 B-24 Liberator bombers of the 319th Squadron/90th Bomb Group (H) of the [[5th Air Force]]. All four were straddled by near-misses, but suffered only slight damage. ''Kinu'' was ordered back to Japan for refit and modifications, arriving at [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] on 2 August 1943.

While at Kure, ''Kinu<U+2019>s'' No. 5 and No.7 140-mm guns were removed as were her catapult and derrick. A twin 127-mm HA gun was fitted as were two triple mount [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|Type 96 25-mm AA guns]]. This brought the ''Kinu<U+2019>s'' 25-mm AA gun total to ten barrels (2x3, 2x2). A type 21 air search [[radar]] was also fitted and [[depth charge]] rails were added to her stern. Refit and modifications are completed 14 October 1943, and ''Kinu'' immediately departed back for Singapore with troops and supplies. ''Kinu'' remained in Singapore, or [[Malacca]] or [[Penang]] in Malaya or at [[Jakarta|Batavia]] in the Dutch East Indies through January 1944.

On 23 January 1944, ''Kinu'' with [[Japanese cruiser Aoba|''Aoba'']] accompanied by the ''Oi'' and ''Kitakami'', and escorted by the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Shikinami|''Shikinami'']] made a troop transport run from Singapore to [[Port Blair]], [[Andaman Islands]]. On its return voyage to Singapore, ''Kinu'' towed the ''Kitakami'', which was damaged by a submarine attack. ''Kinu'' remained on patrol in the western Dutch East Indies through April. 

From April, ''Kinu'' starting escorting transport runs from [[Saipan]] via [[Palau]] to the Celebes and other locations in the Dutch East Indies.

On 27 May 1944, the United States begins "Operation Horlicks" to retake [[Biak]]. ''Kinu'', ''Aoba'', and destroyers ''Shikinami'', [[Japanese destroyer Uranami|''Uranami'']] and [[Japanese destroyer Shigure|''Shigure'']] departed [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] to reinforce Biak with 2,300 troops from [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] on [[Mindanao]]; however, after being sighted by B-24 bombers and receiving word of the [[Battle of Saipan|American invasion of Saipan]], the operation was canceled and the troops were disembarked at [[Sorong (city)|Sorong]] instead. 

On 6 June 1944, while anchored off [[Weigo Island]], [[Vogelkop]], New Guinea, ''Kinu'' and ''Aoba'' were attacked unsuccessfully by B-24 bombers of the Fifth Air Force's 380th Group. ''Kinu'' remained on station for a week, and then returned to her patrol area in the western Dutch East Indies through the end of August.

===In the Philippines===
On 25 September 1944, during Japanese "Operation Sho-I-Go" to boost the defenses the Philippines, ''Kinu'', ''Aoba'' and the destroyer ''Uranami'' were assigned to Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]]'s First Raiding Force. On 11 October 1944 ''Aoba'' collided with ''Kinu'' in a training accident off [[Lingga Islands|Lingga]]. Both ships were slightly damaged. 

On 21 October 1944 Crudiv 16 was detached from Vice Admiral Kurita's Force to assist the Southwest Area Fleet's transport of 2,500 soldiers of the IJA 41st Regiment from [[Cagayan]], Mindanao to [[Ormoc]], [[Leyte]]. The convoy was spotted by [[USS Bream (SS-243)|''USS Bream'' (SS-243)]] on 23 October 1944. The ''Bream'' fired six torpedoes at ''Aoba'', one of which hit her No. 2 engine room. Rear Admiral Sakonjo transferred to the ''Kinu'', which towed ''Aoba'' to the [[Cavite]] Navy Yard near [[Manila]] for emergency repairs. The following day, as ''Kinu'' and ''Uranami'' sortied from Cavite for Cagayan, they were attacked by aircraft from Task Group 38.3's carriers [[USS Essex (CV-9)|''USS Essex'' (CV-9)]] and [[USS Lexington (CV-16)|''USS Lexington'' (CV-16)]]. Near misses caused light structural damage, but strafing killed 47 crewmen aboard the ''Kinu'' and 25 crewmen on the ''Uranami''. 

On 25 October 1944, ''Kinu'' arrived at Cagayan. The naval transports ''T.6'', ''T.9'' and ''T.10'' each embarked 350 troops and the ''T.101'' and ''T.102'' each loaded 400 men, ''Kinu'' embarked 347 men and ''Uranami'' 150 men. On 26 October 1944 in the [[Visayan Sea]] ''Kinu'' and ''Uranami'' were attacked by 75-80 aircraft from two groups of Task Group 77.4's escort carriers. [[TBM Avenger]] torpedo-bombers from the [[USS Natoma Bay (CVE-62)|''USS Natoma Bay'' (CVE-62)]] and 12 Avengers and [[FM-2 Wildcat]] fighters of VC-21 from [[USS Marcus Island (CVE-77)|''USS Marcus Island'' (CVE-77)]] made repeated bomb, rocket and strafing hits on ''Kinu'' and ''Uranami''. An Avenger from the [[USS Manila Bay (CVE-61)|''USS Manila Bay'' (CVE-61)]] scored two direct bomb hits on ''Kinu'' and several rocket hits on ''Uranami'', which sank around noon. At 1130, two more waves of aircraft attacked. A third bomb hit the aft engine room and set ''Kinu'' on fire. The Japanese transports rescued most of the ''Kinu's'' crew of 813 men, including Captain Kawasaki. Rear Admiral Sakonjo transferred his flag to the transport ''T.10'' and made Manila the next day. At 1730, the ''Kinu'' sank by the stern in {{convert|150|ft|m}} of water {{convert|44|mi|km}} southwest of [[Masbate]], Philippine Islands. 

''Kinu'' was removed from the Navy List on 20 December 1944. 

On 15 July 1945 divers from the [[USS Chanticleer (ASR-7)|''USS Chanticleer'' (ASR-7)]] explored the sunken ''Kinu'' and recovered classified documents and several coding machines.
