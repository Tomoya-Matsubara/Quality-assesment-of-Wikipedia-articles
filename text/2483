'''Okkervil River''' ({{Lang-ru|<U+041E><U+043A><U+043A><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+0438><U+043B><U+044C>}}) is a [[river]] in [[Leningrad Oblast]] and the eastern part of the city of [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It is the largest left tributary of the [[Okhta River, Neva basin|Okhta River]]. It is 18&nbsp;km long, the width is 1.5<U+2013>25 meters.

The name ''Okkervil'' appeared in the 17th century, after the Swedish colonel who owned an estate on the bank. On some ancient maps of Saint Petersburg, the river is called ''Little Okhta'' ({{Lang-ru|<U+041C><U+0430><U+043B><U+0430><U+044F> <U+041E><U+0445><U+0442><U+0430>}}) as opposed to Big [[Okhta River, Neva basin|Okhta]]. Yet other times it is called ''Porkhovka'' ({{Lang-ru|<U+041F><U+043E><U+0440><U+0445><U+043E><U+0432><U+043A><U+0430>}}).

"Okkervil River" is the title of a short story by [[Tatyana Tolstaya]]. [[Austin, Texas]]-based [[indie rock]] band named [[Okkervil River (band)|Okkervil River]] takes their name from the story.
