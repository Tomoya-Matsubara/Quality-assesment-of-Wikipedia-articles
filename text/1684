Djawadi is best known for his [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated, guitar-driven score for ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]] ''and for the TV series ''[[Prison Break]]'', ''[[Music of Game of Thrones|Game of Thrones]]'' and ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]''.

==Life and career==
He was born in [[Duisburg]], [[West Germany]], to an [[Iran]]ian father and German mother. After graduating summa cum laude from [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1998, Djawadi garnered the attention of [[Hans Zimmer]], who recruited him to [[Remote Control Productions]]. Djawadi moved to Los Angeles and worked as an assistant to [[Klaus Badelt]].

He then went out on his own with ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', collaborating with [[RZA|The RZA]] for director [[David Goyer]]. This was the beginning of his relationship with Goyer for both film and television. Djawadi wrote the score for Goyer's horror thriller ''[[The Unborn (2009 film)|The Unborn]]'', which was produced by [[Michael Bay]]. Further collaboration with Goyer was the hit television show ''[[FlashForward]]'', earning him his second [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] nomination. Djawadi also composed the Emmy-nominated main title theme for ''[[Prison Break]]'' and the title theme for the related show ''[[Breakout Kings]]''. Djawadi's ethereal score for the film ''[[Mr. Brooks]]'' earned him a World Soundtrack Awards <U+201C>Discovery of the Year<U+201D> nomination. His other scores include ''[[Deception (2008 film)|Deception]]'', starring [[Hugh Jackman]] and [[Ewan McGregor]], and [[Robert Towne]]'s ''[[Ask the Dust (film)|Ask the Dust]]''.

Djawadi scored the first Sony Animation project, ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'', followed by the sequel ''[[Open Season 2]]''. Additional animation scores include ''The Chubbchubbs Save Xmas''. Djawadi's work in these films attracted the filmmakers of the Belgium-based NWave, who created one of the first animated movies in 3D, ''[[Fly Me to the Moon (film)|Fly Me to the Moon]]''. Djawadi completed Warner Brothers' ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' in 2010. Djawadi also scored the soundtrack for the 2010 video game ''[[Medal of Honor (2010 video game)|Medal of Honor]]'' and currently the HBO fantasy drama ''[[Game of Thrones (soundtrack)|Game of Thrones]]'' and the CBS crime drama ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2011/05/31/game-of-thrones-soundtrack-details/|title=Game of Thrones Soundtrack Details|publisher=Film Music Reporter|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=June 15, 2011}}</ref> He will also score the FX's vampire drama ''[[The Strain (TV series)|The Strain]]''. The show is created by ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' director [[Guillermo Del Toro]].
