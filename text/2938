==History==
The University's beginnings stretch back to the project of the Ontario Society of Artists whose objectives included the development of art education in Ontario. The first [[Ontario_Society_of_Artists#Art_school|School of Art]] opened on October 30, 1876, funded by a government grant of $1,000.<ref name=govonca-archives-osa-purchases>{{cite web

===Curriculum===
[[Image:Ontario College of Art - 1931.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Inside a class in 1931.]]

In 1969<U+2013>70, [[Roy Ascott]] radically challenged the pedagogy and curriculum structure of the College.<ref>Wolfe, Morris. ''OCA 1967<U+2013>1972: Five Turbulent Years''. Toronto: Grubstreet Books, 2002. ISBN 0-9689737-0-1</ref> 

In 2008, OCAD president Sara Diamond changed the pedagogy.  She emphasised academics over studio time and required full-time instructors to hold an advanced degree.  There was some controversy as two faculty resigned over the changes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Post |first=National |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/toronto/story.html?id=55364f60-24ab-4b40-8071-b73b2c01cd23&k=64956 |title=Duelling visions: OCAD students are resisting new plans to make big changes |publisher=Canada.com |date=2 February 2007 |accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>
