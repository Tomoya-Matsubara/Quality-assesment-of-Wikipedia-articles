'''Andr<U+00E9> Morell''' ([[August 20]] [[1909]] &ndash; [[November 28]] [[1978]];<ref name="timesobit">{{cite news|title=Mr Andre Morell - Stage, film and television actor|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1978-11-30]]|page=19}}</ref> sometimes credited as '''Andre Morell''') was a [[United Kingdom|British]] actor. He appeared frequently in [[theatre]], [[film]] and on [[television]] from the 1930s to the 1970s. His best known screen roles were as [[Bernard Quatermass|Professor Bernard Quatermass]] in the [[BBC Television]] serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'' (1958&ndash;59), and as [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Doctor Watson]] in the [[Hammer Film Productions]] version of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1959). He also appeared in the [[Academy Award]]-winning films ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957) and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), and in several of Hammer's well-known [[horror film]]s throughout the 1960s.

His obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper described him as possessing a "commanding presence with a rich, responsive voice... whether in the classical or modern theatre he was authoritative and dependable."<ref name="timesobit"/>

==Early life and career==
Morell was born as '''Cecil Andr<U+00E9> Mesritz''' in [[London]], the son of Andr<U+00E9> and Rosa Mesritz.<ref name="timesobit"/><ref name="pixley30">Pixley, p. 30.</ref> Prior to taking up acting professionally he trained as a [[Auto mechanic|motor engineer]], while also participating in amateur theatrical productions.<ref name="pixley30"/> He turned professional in 1934, initially acting under the name Andr<U+00E9> Mesritz; he [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] this to Andr<U+00E9> Morell in 1936, and adopted the latter name legally by [[Deed of change of name|deed poll]] in 1938.<ref name="pixley30"/> 

In 1938 he joined the [[Old Vic]] theatre company, and appeared in several of their high-profile productions both at their home theatre and on tour throughout Britain and across the rest of the world.<ref name="timesobit"/> He appeared in ''[[Hamlet]]'' as [[Horatio (character)|Horatio]] opposite [[Alec Guinness]] in the title role, and as Alonso in [[John Gielgud]]'s production of ''[[The Tempest]]''.<ref name="timesobit"/> He  played [[Mercutio]] in a production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' mounted by the Old Vic company at [[Streatham]] in 1939, with [[Robert Donat]] as Romeo.<ref name="timesobit"/> This was Morell's favourite role from his career.<ref name="timesobit"/> His performance in the play was praised by ''The Times'''s critic as "a neat and carefully studied portrait; he is admirable in all his cynical and humorous passages," although the reviewer did add that "one could wish that he had left this manner for the speech about [[Queen Mab]] and addressed this, as a piece of direct poetry, directly to the audience."<ref>{{cite news|title=Streatham Hill Theatre - 'Romeo and Juliet' by William Shakespeare|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1939-10-04]]|page=6}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 1930s he began appearing in films, making his debut on the big screen in ''13 Men and a Gun'' in 1938.<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603682/|title=Andr<U+00E9> Morell|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> He appeared frequently in several early drama productions on the [[BBC]]'s fledgling television service, featuring in such roles as Mr Wickham in ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1938) and Le Bret in ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1938).<ref name="imdb"/> The onset of [[World War II]] interrupted his acting career, and he joined the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] in 1940. He served with the regiment until 1946, by which time he had attained the rank of [[major]].<ref name="timesobit"/>

==Major film and television roles==
Morell returned to the theatre after the war, including another spell at the Old Vic in the 1951&ndash;52 season.<ref name="timesobit"/> However, he now increasingly began to win leading parts on television, and in 1953 was cast by the [[television director]] [[Rudolph Cartier]] in a play called ''It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer''.<ref name="murray28">Murray, p. 28.</ref> Cartier was impressed with Morell's performance in this play, and offered him the leading role in a science-fiction serial he was preparing with the writer [[Nigel Kneale]], entitled ''[[The Quatermass Experiment]]''. Morell considered the not-yet-completed script, but decided to decline the offer; the part went instead to his co-star from ''It Is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer'', [[Reginald Tate]].<ref name="murray28"/>

He did take one of the leading parts in another Cartier and Kneale production the following year, when he played [[O'Brien (1984)|O'Brien]] in [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (TV programme)|their version of]] [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', opposite [[Peter Cushing]] as [[Winston Smith]].<ref name="murray67">Murray, p. 67.</ref> This was a successful and controversial production which provoked much comment and debate;<ref name="obrien">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/438460/index.html|title=Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954)|first=Mark|last=Duguid|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> Morell's part in it has been praised for his "coolly menacing performance [that] is at least equal to Cushing's."<ref name="obrien"/>

This successful collaboration with Cartier and Kneale resulted, four years later, in him once again being offered the role of Professor Bernard Quatermass for the pair's third serial in the series, ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', although on this occasion another actor &mdash; [[Alec Clunes]] &mdash; had already turned them down.<ref name="murray67"/> This time Morell accepted the part, and is regarded by several critics as having provided the definitive interpretation of the character.<ref name="murray67"/><ref name="heaven">{{cite book|title=TV Heaven|first=Jim|last=Sangster|coauthors=Paul Condon|year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=London|chapter=The Quatermass series|pages=pp. 596&ndash;601|id=ISBN 0007190999}}</ref> Morell personally found that in later years it was the role for which he was most often remembered by members of the public.<ref name="pixley30"/>

As well as these and other television appearances, Morell gained several notable film roles towards the end of the 1950s. He appeared in two films which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]; ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, as Colonel Green,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/450937/credits.html|title=Bridge on the River Kwai, The (1957) - Cast|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> and ''Ben-Hur'' in 1959 as Sextus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/|title=Ben-Hur (1959)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> Also in 1959 he played [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s famous character Doctor Watson, again opposite Peter Cushing who was this time playing [[Sherlock Holmes]], in Hammer Film Productions' version of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/11_november/25/baskervilles_release.shtml|title=The Hound of the Baskervilles - A Filmography|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]|date=[[2002-11-25]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> This was the first Sherlock Holmes adaptation ever to be shot in [[color film|colour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052905/trivia|title=Trivia for The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle's stories, and away from the bumbling stereotype established by [[Nigel Bruce]]'s interpretation of the role.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hammer Films - The Bray Studios Years|first=Wayne|last=Kinsey|year=2002|publisher=Reynolds & Hearn Ltd|location=[[Richmond, London|Richmond]]|id=ISBN 1-903111-11-0|pages=p. 133}}</ref>

In 1960 Morell appeared as Brack in a production of [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' at [[The Oxford Playhouse]].<ref name="timesobit"/> Starring opposite him in the title role was the film star [[Joan Greenwood]]. They fell in love and flew in secret to [[Jamaica]], where they were married, remaining together until his death.<ref name="wifeobit">{{cite news|title=Obituary of Miss Joan Greenwood, The voice that intrigued generations|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1987-03-03]]}}</ref>

==Later career==
After his appearance in their version of ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' in 1959, in the following decade Morell appeared in several of Hammer Film Productions' famous range of horror films. He had parts in ''[[She (1965 film)|She]]'' (1965, again with Peter Cushing) and its sequel ''Vengeance of She'' (1967), ''[[The Plague of the Zombies]]'' (1966), and took the lead role in 1967's ''[[The Mummy's Shroud]]''.<ref name="imdb"/> The same year Hammer produced a feature film adaptation of ''[[Quatermass and the Pit (film)|Quatermass and the Pit]]'', and offered Morell the chance to play the Professor again in their version of the story. Morell declined the offer, not wishing to repeat the same part in the same story he had already played successfully on television.<ref name="murray95">Murray, p. 95.</ref> He continued to act successfully on television throughout the decade, with guest roles in episodes of series such as ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1963 and 1965), ''[[Danger Man]]'' (1965), ''[[Doctor Who]]'' ("[[The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve]]", 1965), and ''[[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]]'' (1965).<ref name="imdb"/>

In 1969 he became the vice president of [[British Actors' Equity Association|Equity]], the [[trade union]] for British actors and performers. He then served as president of the organisation for a year from 1973&ndash;74.<ref name="timesobit"/> During this time he was involved in a dispute in which Equity threatened to expel [[Laurence Olivier]] as a member due to comments he made in a newspaper feature about the possibility of forming a breakaway union.<ref>{{cite news|title=Equity may expel Lord Olivier|first=Kenneth|last=Gosling|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1974-06-24]]|page=2}}</ref> The union also suffered from financial problems, and Morell continued to warn against destructive divisions amongst the members when he stepped down as president.<ref>{{cite news|title=Equity chief fears 'destructive' union clash|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=[[1975-05-12]]|page=2}}</ref>

Despite his involvement in union business he continued to be a busy working actor. His last television work was an episode of the [[ITV]] series ''[[The Professionals]]'' in 1978, the year of his death. The animated film version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', in which he voiced the character of [[Elrond]], was released the same year, but his final film work was not seen until the year after his death. This was as the judge in ''[[The First Great Train Robbery]]''.<ref name="imdb"/>

Morell died in London in 1978, at the age of sixty-nine. He was survived by his wife Greenwood and their son Jason. Jason Morell also became an actor, appearing in films such as ''[[Mrs. Brown]]'' (1997, as [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]) and ''[[Wilde (film)|Wilde]]'' (also 1997, as [[Ernest Dowson]]).<ref name="son">{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603695/|title=Jason Morell|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref>
