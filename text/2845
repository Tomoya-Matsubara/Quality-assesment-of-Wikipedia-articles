The '''2005 League of Ireland''' season began on Friday [[18 March]] [[2005]] and ended with the [[FAI Cup]] Final on Sunday December 4<sup>th</sup>. This season saw the Premier Divsision expanded to include twelve teams with the First Division now reduced to ten. This was the opposite to what it had been before. The league's management committee also announced changes regarding the prize money for the season. The total fund was increased from <U+20AC>100,000 to around <U+20AC>450,000.<ref>{{cite news|title= Eircom League season launched|date=[[2005-03-14]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0314/eircomleague.html }}</ref> At the end of the season [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] became league champions but were beaten in the cup final by [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]].

== eircom League Season ==
=== Premier Division ===

The season began on 18<sup>th</sup> March with four matches getting the season underway.  The league's biggest derby between [[Shamrock Rovers]] and [[Bohemian F.C.]] ended in a 1-1 draw. [[Bray Wanderers A.F.C.|Bray Wanderers]] and [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] both recorded victories but the surprise on the opening day was holders and favourites [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] drew 1-1 at home to [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|U.C.D.]]. Shelbourne did improve, however, and, at the end of the month, along with [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] and Bray Wanderers were the early leaders, all on seven points with three games played.

April saw [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] march to the top of the table with victories in all their matches bar one - a 0-0 draw against [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]].  They definitely looked like the team to beat.  Meanwhile, at the bottom it looked like that it might be a season of struggle for [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] who had yet to register a victory.  It was also a disappointing start for both [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] and [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] who were the other two clubs in the bottom three. Shamrock Rovers also entered [[examinership]] due to their financial troubles. It was reported that they were in debt but did have a reasonable chance of surviving so the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] ruled that an examiner should be appointed.<ref>{{cite news|title= Examiner appointed to Shamrock Rovers|date=[[2005-04-12]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0412/shamrockrovers.html }}</ref>

In May there was big developments at both the top and bottom of the table with the bottom the more significant. [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] were deducted eight points for a 'serious breach of the licensing process'. When the club went into examinership it was discovered that they were <U+20AC>2,360,000 in debt and this financial and accounting information was not given when applying for a [[UEFA]] License. Many people were of the opinion that they got off lightly, however, as it was expected that they might be automatically relegated to the [[FAI First Division|First Division]] or suffer expulsion from the league altogether.<ref>{{cite news|title= Rovers hit the bottom after 8-point deduction|date=[[2005-05-14]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0514/shamrockrovers.html }}</ref>  At the end of the month this left them on three points and last in the table.  On the field there was some surprises at the top of the table. [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who at the start of the campaign looked like they might stroll to the league title, were beaten in successive matches. The second of these defeats was to [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] who lead the table after this victory by three points.

[[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]]'s poor form continued into the month of June. A 1-1 draw with [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|U.C.D.]] was followed by a disappointing home defeat to [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. They eventually ended their five game winless streak with a 4-2 victory at [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford]] but at this stage had certainly handed the initiative over to [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] who still led the way by three points but had now played a game less. [[Derry City F.C.|Derry]], also, had cut the gap to second place Shelbourne to four points and had two games in hand over them.  At the bottom of the table Shamrock Rovers were still bottom and were now five points behind 11<sup>th</sup> place [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] after the big relegation clash between the two sides finished 4-1 in the [[County Donegal|Donegal]] side's favour. Without doubt Shamrock Rovers were in danger of being relegated for the first time in their history.

At the end of July it looked as there was only one place that the league title was going and that was to [[Cork City F.C.|Cork]]. With over half of the campaign gone they were now an incredible fourteen points clear of [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] who had dropped to third place. The only team with any chance of catching Cork appeared to be [[Derry City F.C.|Derry]]. They were seven points adrift of the league leaders but did have a game in hand. At the other end [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] were now last. [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] had overtaken them and looked like that they could escape from trouble. At this stage they were just three points behind [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] in 10<sup>th</sup> place.

It seemed like the title might go to the wire now. With exactly two thirds of the season gone [[Cork City F.C.|Cork]] were now just three points ahead of [[Derry City F.C.|Derry]]. [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] were definitely out of the title race. They were still fourteen points behind the league leaders. They just seemed to be in a battle for a European spot with [[Longford Town F.C.|Longford]], [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda]] and [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] who were separated by four points. [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] were out of the bottom two after gaining seven points from their three matches in August. Probably the most important result was the 1-0 victory over fellow strugglers [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]]. Going on Rovers current form, it seemed like they may pull clear from danger leaving [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] and Waterford United to battle to avoid automatic relegation.

With just goal difference separating the top two now it was certainly going to be nail-biting climax to the season but crucially [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] had played a game less. [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] had now cemented a European spot. They were ten points clear of their nearest rivals. At the foot of the table it looked like a gap was opening up between the bottom two and the rest. It seemed a straight dogfight between [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] and [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] to see who would go down automatically and who would enter the relegation/promotion playoff. There was still time for that to change, however, as [[University College Dublin F.C.|U.C.D.]], [[Bray Wanderers A.F.C.|Bray Wanderers]], [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]] were still not entirely safe.

Going into the final month of the league season only three goals on goal difference could separate leaders [[Cork City F.C.|Cork]] from [[Derry City F.C.|Derry]] but the end of October provided a few shocks as both the top two suffered home defeats to relegation battlers. These results coupled with [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] defeat to [[Bray Wanderers A.F.C.|Bray Wanderers]] proved disastrous for Rovers as they dropped back down to eleventh place although they had played a game less and were just a point behind [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] and three adrift of [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|U.C.D.]] and [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]]. [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] were all but down at this stage. They were five points behind Rovers with just three games remaining.

The final of the day league would prove to be an exciting affair. With [[Derry City F.C.|Derry]] taking full advantage of [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]]'s draw against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] the previous weekend, they were now top. All they needed was a point to seal their first league title since 1997. The only trouble was that their final match was away to their title rivals Cork. What a game there was in prospect. One thing was certain was that the trophy would be leaving [[Dublin]] for the first time since Derry's last title. Unfortunately for [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] there would be no last day drama for them. They were consigned to a relegation /promotion playoff after a 2-1 defeat to [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]]. [[Finn Harps F.C.|Finn Harps]] were also officially relegated on the penultimate day.

The 18<sup>th</sup> of November arrived and all eyes were on [[Turner's Cross]] for the league title decider. [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] started the better and nearly scored inside thirty seconds when [[John O'Flynn]] headed just over the crossbar. They were not to be denied however, and struck the deserved lead goal when O'Flynn headed home from a [[Roy O'Donovan]] cross. Cork dominated the rest of the opening half but it seemed that the second killer goal woul just not come. It didn't until the 16<sup>th</sup> minute of the second half when [[Denis Behan]] set up [[Liam Kearney]] to score. [[Derry City F.C.|Derry]] never gave up, however, and were close to pulling a goal back but [[Michael Devine (footballer)|Michael Devine]] managed to pull off a fine save from a [[Pat McCourt]] header. It was to be Cork City's day, though, as they went on to see the match out and clinch their second league title.<ref>{{cite news|title= Cork City clinch eircom League crown|date=[[2005-11-18]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/1118/corkcity1.html }}</ref> The final table looked like this:

=== First Division ===

[[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] won promotion back to the [[FAI Premier Division|Premier Division]] after they finished top of the [[FAI First Division|First Division]] by two points. [[Dublin City F.C.|Dublin City]] were runners-up and as a result entered the promotion/relegation playoff against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. [[Athlone Town A.F.C.|Athlone Town]] endured the embarrassment of finishing last. They were eight points adrift of closest rivals [[Monaghan United F.C.|Monaghan United]].

=== Promotion/Relegation Playoff ===

[[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] played [[Dublin City F.C.|Dublin City]] in probably the most important match of the season for both clubs. The winner would be in the [[FAI Premier Division|Premier Division]] next season while the loser would participate in the [[FAI First Division|First Division]]. Shamrock Rovers were at home for the first leg which was played at [[Dalymount Park]]. Dublin City struck a blow for Rovers when [[Aidan Lynch]] gave them the lead in the 43<sup>rd</sup> minute. A [[Trevor Molloy]] penalty in the second half made it 1-1 but five minutes from time disaster struck for Rovers as [[David McGill]] scored for Dublin and that was enough to inflict a home defeat for Rovers in the first leg. It seemed that they had a mountain to climb now. The second leg at [[Tolka Park]] proved a tense affair. The pressure was certainly on Shamrock Rovers who knew they had to win or else face a season in the First Division for the first time in their history. Neither team could find a goal in the first half but when Robbie Collins gave Dublin City the lead it looked very bleak for Rovers. They did equalise on the night just two minutes later through Rovers legend [[Derek Treacy]] but that was as much they could do. Dublin City were celebrating promotion but Shamrock Rovers were journeying into the unknown. Rovers faced an uncertain future with their debts and now relegation to the First Division.

== Eircom League Clubs in Europe ==
=== Champions League ===

[[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] were the [[Football League of Ireland|League of Ireland]]'s representative in this season's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. After their exploits the previous season (they were the first League of Ireland club to reach the third qualifying round) all eyes were on them this season hoping that they could at least match their achievements of last season. The first qualifying round threw up an intriguing tie against the [[Irish League]] champions [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]]. The first leg was held at [[The Oval]] but it was Shelbourne who took a lead back to [[Tolka Park]]. Two [[Jason Byrne]] strikes gave Shels a 2-1 victory over their Irish League opponents.<ref>{{cite news|title= Byrne double gives Shels advantage|date= [[2005-07-13]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0713/shelbourne.html }}</ref> Shelbourne convincingly killed off the tie in the second leg to record a 4-1 victory and 6-2 win overall. Goals from [[Owen Heary]], Jason Byrne (2) and [[Glen Crowe]] sealed a meeting with [[Steaua Bucharest]] second qualifying round.<ref>{{cite news|title= Shels easily advance to second round|date= [[2005-07-20]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0720/shelbourne.html }}</ref> This proved to be a much tougher affair. Shelbourne were at home in the first leg and had to be satisfied with a 0-0 draw to take to [[Romania]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Shelbourne 0-0 Steaua Bucharest |date= [[2005-07-27]]|publisher= [[bbc.co.uk]]|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4717813.stm }}</ref> They were beaten in [[Bucharest]], however, by 4-1 to end their European adventure for this season.<ref>{{cite news|title= Score flatters Steaua as Shels bow out|date= [[2005-08-03]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0803/shelbourne1.html }}</ref>

=== UEFA Cup ===

[[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] did the better of the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s two teams in the [[UEFA Cup]]. Cork City progressed through to the first round proper of the tournament. In the first qualifying round they overcame [[Lithuania]]n side [[FK Ekranas]] 2-1 on aggregate. They then beat [[Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF]] on away goals after a 1-1 aggregate draw in the second qualifying round. They missed out on qualification to the group stage, however, by losing to [[Slavia Prague]] in the First Round. The Rebels lost both legs 2-0 and 2-1 respectively. [[Longford Town F.C.|Longford Town]] were the other Irish team in the tournament but they were beaten 5-3 on aggregate in the First Qualifying round by [[Carmarthen Town]] of [[Wales]]. This was a disappointment especially since Longford won the first leg at [[Flancare Park]] by 2-0.

=== Intertoto Cup ===

[[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] lost 3-1 on aggregate to [[AA Gent]] in the first round of the [[Intertoto Cup]]. Like [[Longford Town F.C.|Longford]] in the [[UEFA Cup]], Bohs had won the first leg at home but obviously it was not enough to see them through.

=== UEFA Coefficient ===

The [[FAI League of Ireland|FAI National League]] clubs' performances in Europe this season meant that the league received a coefficient of 1.833 added to their overall coefficient which now accumulated to 4.331. This gave them a ranking 40<sup>th</sup> place as shown.

== FAI Cup ==

The First Round of the [[FAI Cup]] consisted of 20 non-league and junior sides with 10 progressing through to the next round to join the 22 league clubs. The second round did provide a couple of shock results. The main one was non-league [[Wayside Celtic F.C.|Wayside Celtic]] defeating [[FAI First Division|First Division]] side [[Cobh Ramblers F.C.|Cobh Ramblers]] by 1-0. The other was Malahide United forcing a replay with [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]], although Sligo did win the replay. The big match in the round was the meeting of [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] and [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] at [[Tolka Park]] and unexpectedly the Candystripes won 2-0 against the then league champions. Another result of note was [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]]'s 7-1 victory over fellow First Division side [[Monaghan United F.C.|Monaghan United]].

The third round involved a [[County Louth]] derby between [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]]. The [[FAI Premier Division|Premier Division]] side overcame their neighbours 2-0. [[FAI First Division|First Division]] side [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] caused a shock by defeating [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.|St Patrick's Athletic]]. Non-league [[Wayside Celtic F.C.|Wayside Celtic]], also, forced a replay with [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] although Bohs went through in the replay.

By the quarter-final stage, [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] were the only team left in the tournament who were not in the [[FAI Premier Division|Premier Division]]. That was as far as they got, however, as they lost to [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]]. [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]], [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] and [[Bray Wanderers A.F.C.|Bray Wanderers]] were the clubs that progressed to the semi-finals.

The first semi-final took place on the 21<sup>st</sup> October between [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] and [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]]. The match was a tight affair and it took a penalty in the final minute to separate the two sides. [[George O'Callaghan]] put the Leesiders through to the final with his by cooly taken spot-kick. The other semi-final was also tight and involved late drama. [[Declan O'Brien (footballer)|Declan O'Brien]] gave [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda]] a 1-0 lead in the first half. They were no more goals, however, until the last ten minutes when Drogheda scored a second and looked to have sealed a place in the final but [[Bray Wanderers A.F.C.|Bray]] managed to find the net two minutes after Drogheda's strike. Drogheda hung on, though, to book place in December's final against Cork.

The final took place on the 4<sup>th</sup> December at [[Lansdowne Road]]. [[Cork City F.C.|Cork]] were looking for a double after winning the league title a fortnight before. Neither side could force a breakthrough in the first half but it did not take long in the second half for a goal to be scored and it went to the underdogs. [[Gavin Whelan]] gave [[Drogheda United F.C.|the Drogs]] the lead in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute which had supporters dreaming of a first [[FAI Cup]] success. Cork tried to get back into the match but it was not to be as [[Declan O'Brien (footballer)|Declan O'Brien]] sealed the cup for Drogheda seven minutes from time.

== Off-Field Issues ==
=== Shamrock Rovers ===

In April [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] financial difficulties really came to light. The [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] ruled that an examiner should be appointed at the club. He discovered that they had debts amounting to <U+20AC>2,360,000 . The following month it was made public that this information was not given by the club when they applied for a [[UEFA]] License for the new season. This was a very serious breach of the rules and many people expected a severe punishment for them .Punishments such as immediate relegation or even complete expulsion from the league were talked about. Eventually the authorities decided that the club should be docked eight points. At the time it seemed that Rovers had got off lightly but at the end of the season these points proved crucial in condemning the club to a relegation/promotion playoff which of course they lost.<ref>{{cite news|title= Rovers hit the bottom after 8-point deduction|date= [[2005-05-14]]|publisher= [[rte.ie]]|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/2005/0514/shamrockrovers.html }}</ref> This certainly did not help the financial situation at the club and they were danger of going out of business. Fortunately for the club, a fans trust was able to take over the club and keep them from becoming extinct.<ref>{{cite news|title= New dawn beckons for Rovers |date= [[2005-07-16]]|publisher= [[irish examiner.ie]] |url= http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2005/07/16/story612671464.asp }}</ref> Towards the end of the season [[Roddy Collins]] was sacked as manager of the club despite having a year left on his contract. He was replaced by [[Alan O'Neill]] for the playoff games. Roddy Collins took this dismissal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. A settlement was eventually reached the following year..<ref>{{cite news|title= Sacked Shamrock Rovers manager settles unfair dismissal claim|date= [[2006-11-17]]|publisher= [[ireland.com]]|url= http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2006/1117/1163702728072.html }}</ref>
