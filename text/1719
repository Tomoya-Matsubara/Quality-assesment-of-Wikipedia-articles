 eponym=[[Naum Ilyich Idelson|Naum I. Idel'son]]}}
'''Idel'son''' is a [[Moon|lunar]] [[Impact crater|crater]] that is located on the [[Far side (Moon)|far side]] of the [[Moon]]. It lies just behind the southern lunar limb, in a region that is sometimes brought into view of the [[Earth]] due to [[libration]]. Idel'son is situated to the southwest of the huge walled plain [[Schr<U+00F6>dinger (crater)|Schr<U+00F6>dinger]].

The northern rim of Idel'son is overlain by the larger crater [[Ganswindt (crater)|Ganswindt]], reversing the usual order of smaller craters on top of larger impacts usually seen on the Moon. The outer [[glacis]] of Ganswindt covers nearly half the interior floor of Idel'son, reaching to the mid-point. The remainder of the interior and rim of the crater has been partly overlain by ejecta, producing a rounded, lumpy surface. Still the surviving outer rim remains distinct, and is not overlain by any other impacts of note. The largest impact within the interior is a tiny crater next to the southeastern inner wall.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Idel'son.
