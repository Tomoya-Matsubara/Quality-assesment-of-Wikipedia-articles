"'''The Abducted'''" is the seventh [[List of Fringe episodes|episode]] of the [[Fringe  (season 3)|third season]] of the American [[science fiction]] [[drama]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''. The third season spent much of its time alternating between the prime and parallel universes, and "The Abducted" was set in the latter. The episode followed the Fringe team's investigation of "the Candyman", a man who kidnaps children to harvest their youth-giving hormones.

The episode first aired on November 18, 2010 in the United States to an estimated 4.85 million viewers. Reviews of the episode were mixed; multiple critics lauded the final five minutes of the episode, while another praised lead actress Anna Torv and actor Lance Reddick's performances. Due to the holiday of [[Thanksgiving]], "The Abducted" began a two week break that did not end until the broadcast of a [[Entrada (Fringe)|December 2 episode]].

==Plot==
"The Abducted" takes place in the [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]; Olivia ([[Anna Torv]]), having broken her conditioning that made her believe she was her [[doppelg<U+00E4>nger]] Fauxlivia (Torv) from that universe, maintains the pretense that she is still conditioned. She meets with Henry ([[Andre Royo]]), the taxi driver who helped her out before, and asks him to help her return to [[Liberty Island]] to use the [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] to return herself to her universe.

A child, Max (Michael Strusievici), is kidnapped from his home. The Fringe team investigates and Broyles ([[Lance Reddick]]) immediately recognizes this as the work of "The Candyman"; though only appearing once every two years, the Candyman abducts a child and returns him some days later, but whatever the Candyman has done leaves the child physically deprived. Broyles' own son, Christopher (Curtis Harris), was one of the most recent victims, having become blind as a result of the ordeal. Christopher tells Olivia that he believes there were two people involved with his abduction, one old and one young. Combined with other information, Olivia suspects that the Candyman is draining the children of hormones from the [[pituitary gland]], helping the Candyman stay young.

The interview leads Olivia and Broyles to Reverend Marcus ([[David Nykl]]), who gave up a career as a physician in order to establish a local church. Working through the congregation list, Olivia talks to one member, Wyatt Toomy ([[Will Rothhaar]]), a garbageman. When Olivia spots a child's toy within his apartment, Wyatt realizes he is caught and attempts to escape, but Olivia captures him. She soon finds Max in a hidden room with a not-yet-activated device on the back of his head near the pituitary gland. She frees the boy, accidentally telling him she is an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent.

Believing the case completed, Olivia goes to meet with Henry, where he has gotten use of his cousin's boat. As he talks about having been trained to use it, Olivia contemplates how Wyatt knew about the chemistry to make the serum, and realizes he had a teacher as well - their true culprit, and immediately suspects Reverend Marcus. Broyles and Olivia hurry to his house to protect Christopher from Marcus; Broyles subdues Marcus. Olivia accompanies Broyles and his family to the same hospital that Max is being treated. There, Max thanks Olivia personally and asks her about what the "FBI" is. Broyles, having listened to Olivia's conversation, knows that she has broken her conditioning, as the FBI had ceased to exist years earlier in the parallel universe. Because of her efforts to save Christopher, he lets her go.

Olivia rejoins Henry and then leaves him to swim the rest of the way in and make her way to the isolation tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate ([[John Noble]]) had used on her, she enters the tank and soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter ([[Joshua Jackson]]). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.

Back in the prime universe, Peter and Fauxlivia are sleeping together when Peter receives a call from the cleaning lady, who relays the message: that Olivia is trapped in the parallel universe. Peter realizes that he has been sleeping with Olivia's doppelg<U+00E4>nger.

"The Abducted" was written by co-executive producer [[David Wilcox (screenwriter)|David Wilcox]] and executive story editor [[Graham Roland]], and directed by filmmaker [[Chuck Russell]].<ref name=sfscope/> The episode featured guest appearances by Curtis Harris, David Nykl, John Hainsworth, Karen Holness, [[Andre Royo]], Will Rothhaar, Tristin Leffler, and Michael Strusievici. Holness and Royo had previously guest starred on ''Fringe'' before as the characters [[List of Fringe characters#Minor characters|Diane Broyles]] and [[List of Fringe characters#Minor characters|Henry Higgins]], respectively.<ref name=sfscope/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ugo.com/tv/fringe-amber-31422-preview | title = Fringe's Next Episodes Wet, Wild and Cancer-Free | first = Kevin | last = Fitzpatrick | date = 2010-10-18 | accessdate = 2011-05-17 | publisher = [[UGO Networks]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/fringe-2010/episode-7-season-3/abducted/293813 | title = Fringe Episode: "The Abducted" | first = | last = | date = | accessdate = 2011-10-10 | work= [[TV Guide]] }}</ref>

Alluding to the normally "no-nonsense" personality of his character [[Phillip Broyles]], actor [[Lance Reddick]] noted that for once "you get to see [Broyles] smile and have fun. Not for very long, but you see it. You get to meet his ex-wife (Karen Holness) and find out why his marriage ended. You understand more about his relationship to his work and his job and the Fringe Division<U+2013>how he feels about it and why he does what he does."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.redeyechicago.com/show-patrol/2009/11/05/lance_reddicks_big_broyles_episode_of_fringe/ | title = Lance Reddick<U+2019>s big Broyles episode of <U+2018>Fringe<U+2019> | first = | last = | date =2009-11-05 | accessdate = 2011-12-06 | work= Red Eye Chicago |publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' }}</ref>

Reddick drew inspiration for the episode from undercover [[FBI]] agent [[Joe Pistone]], whom he met while filming the TV series ''[[Falcone (TV series)|Falcone]]''. Pistone recommended his autobiography ''[[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia]]'', and Reddick found many parallels to it and the episode. "In the book, [Pistone] talked about how while being undercover in the Mafia, he had to separate his personal feelings from his professional and moral sense of responsibility. There were certain guys he really couldn<U+2019>t stand, but there were some people he genuinely liked, even though ultimately he had to bring them down. I think Col. Broyles feels the same way about Olivia. On various occasions, she has performed heroically to earn his respect, and in tonight<U+2019>s episode, that appreciation <U+2014> and the angst that goes with it <U+2014> reaches a new level".<ref name=ewinterview>{{cite web | url = http://insidetv.ew.com/2010/11/18/fringe-lance-reddick/ |title ='Fringe': Lance Reddick dishes on tonight's Broyles-centric episode, and how the real-life 'Donnie Brasco' inspires him |date=  2010-11-18 |accessdate= 2011-02-24 |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|first = Jeff|last = Jensen}}</ref>
