Mudkip are famous for being one of the three species of Pok<U+00E9>mon players can choose from at the beginning of their adventure in the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'']] & [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Sapphire'']] and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]'' versions of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon]] series. The purpose of Mudkip in the games, anime and manga, as with all other Pok<U+00E9>mon, is to battle both wild Pok<U+00E9>mon, untamed creatures encountered while the player passes through various environments, and tamed Pok<U+00E9>mon owned by [[Pok<U+00E9>mon trainer]]s.<ref name=Rsreview> {{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/389/389660p1.html|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Pok<U+00E9>mon Sapphire Review (page 1)|publisher=Ign.com''|accessedate=2006-06-01}}</ref>

Mudkip's name is a [[portmanteau]] of ''mud'', being a surrounding of its natural habitat, and "Kip", which refers to "Skip", relating to the [[Mudskipper]], the fish it resembles.<ref name=origin>{{cite web|url=http://pokedream.com/pokedex/pokedex.php?id=258|title=Pokemon Dream :: PokeDex (258 Mudkip)|publisher=pokedream.com|accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref> The "-kip" may also come from the fish-species [[Kipper]]. The name ''Mudkip'' refers to both the overall species, and to individual Mudkip within the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (video games)|games]], [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|anime]] and [[manga]] series. Its Japanese name is likely a [[portmanteau]] of {{nihongo|<U+6C34>|''mizu''}}, water, and {{nihongo|<U+30E0><U+30C4><U+30B4><U+30ED><U+30A6>|''mutsugor<U+014D>''}}, [[Mudskipper]].

==Characteristics==
The fin on Mudkip's head acts as highly sensitive radar. Using this fin to sense movements of water and air, Mudkip can determine what is taking place around it without using its eyes. When in water, Mudkip breathes using the gills on its cheeks. On land, it can powerfully lift large boulders by planting its four feet and heaving. It sleeps by burying itself in soil at the water's edge. Its large tail fin propels it through water with powerful acceleration. If it is faced with a tight situation in battle, Mudkip will become strong enough to crush rocks bigger than itself.<ref name=dex>The in-game [[Pok<U+00E9>dex]]es from the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video games|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' video games]] ([http://psypokes.com/dex/pokedex.php?id=258&view=general A copy of them from Psypokes.com]) URL Accessed [[2006-06-16]]</ref>

==In the video games==
One of the consistent aspects of most [[Pok<U+00E9>mon video games|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games]] <U+2014> spanning from ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|Pok<U+00E9>mon Red]]'' and [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red and Blue|''Blue'']] on the [[Game Boy line|Nintendo Game Boy]] to the un-released [[Nintendo DS]] game, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond]]'' and [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pearl'']] <U+2014> is the choice of three different Pok<U+00E9>mon at the start of the player's adventures; these three are often labelled ''Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon''. Players can choose a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Water-type|Water-type]], a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Fire-type|Fire-type]], or a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Grass-type|Grass-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon indigenous to that particular region<ref name=rubyreview> {{cite web|url=http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby'' review (page 1)|publisher=Gamespy.com|accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>; an exception to this rule is ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow]]'' (a remake of the original games that follows the story of the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|Pok<U+00E9>mon anime]]''), where players are given a [[Pikachu]], an [[Pok<U+00E9>mon type#Electric-type|Electric-type]] mouse famous for being the mascot of the Pok<U+00E9>mon media franchise.<ref name=yellowreview>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/162/162045p1.html|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Yellow Critical Review|publisher=gba.ign.com|accessdate=2006-03-27|author=Craig Harris}}</ref>

Mudkip is the Water-type choice in [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby]]'', ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire|Pok<U+00E9>mon Sapphire]]'' and ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Emerald]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance|Nintendo Game Boy Advance]].<ref name=rubyreview/> Choosing one as the player's starting Pok<U+00E9>mon is considered easier than choosing the Fire-type ([[Torchic]]), but equally as difficult as choosing the Grass-type ([[Treecko]]), primarily because of the advantage it has in defeating the first [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Gym|Gym-leader]], [[List of Hoenn Gym Leaders#Roxanne|Roxanne]], a powerful trainer whom the player must defeat to progress in the game.<ref name=Rsreview/> Roxanne uses [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Rock-type|Rock-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon <U+2014> such as [[Geodude]] <U+2014> that have a natural weakness to Grass and Water attacks.<ref name=gamefaqs>{{cite web|url=http://db.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/file/pokemon_rs_b.txt|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and ''Sapphire'' Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon Evaluation|publisher=Db.gamefaqs.com|accessedate=2006-04-12}} (See "Starting Pok<U+00E9>mon")</ref><ref name=psypokeswalkthrough> {{cite web|url=http://www.psypokes.com/rs/walkthrough.php?part=1|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby walkthrough|publisher=Psypokes.com|accessedate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

It is a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Water-type|Water-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon, meaning it specialzes in firing water (in bubbles or in jet spurts) to attack foe. Mudkip evolves, a metamorphic change within a Pok<U+00E9>mon caused by gaining experience in battle,<ref name=dum> {{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonelite2000.com/dummies.html|title=Pokemon For Dummies|publisher=Pokemonelite2000.com|accessedate=2006-05-25}}</ref> into [[Marshtomp]], its Stage-1 (middle) form at level 16, and evolves into its Stage-2 (final) form, [[Swampert]], at Level 36.<ref name=pojo>{{cite web|url=http://www.pojo.com/pokedex/Ruby-Sapphire/007.htm|title=Pojo Advance Pok<U+00E9>dex Entry for Mudkip|publisher=Pojo.com|accessedate=2005-04-12}}</ref> Mudkip is often chosen as a starter because its evolved forms, Marshtomp and [[Swampert]] are [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Water-type|Water-type]] and [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Ground-type|Ground-type]], meaning they specialize in ground-based moves as well as water-based moves. Being part ground-type gives Swampert and Marshtomp immunity to [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Electric-type|electricity-based]] moves, which water types would normally take a lot of damage from. Also, Swampert is considered an "overused Pok<U+00E9>mon", meaning that it is used very often in battles.<ref name=Tiers>{{cite web|url=http://www.smogon.com/advance/tiers|title=ADV tier list|publisher=Smogon.com|accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

One interesting thing about Mudkip is that its evolved forms, Marshtomp and Swampert, cannot learn Hydro Pump, which is a powerful water-based attack. On the other hand, Mudkip would learn this move at Level 42.<ref name=hydropump>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smogon.com/advance/hydro%20pump|title=Hydro Pump attack data|publisher=Smogon.com|accessdate=2006-06-10}}</ref>

Mudkip is also one of the main characters in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Mystery Dungeon]]'', for the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo Game Boy Advance]]. At the beginning of the game, the player takes a personality quiz. Depending on the answers to the questions, the player could begin the game as one of many characters, including [[Pikachu]], [[Bulbasaur]] and Mudkip. If Bulbasaur or another Pok<U+00E9>mon is selected as the player, however, Mudkip can become one of the player's "partners" at the beginning of the game.<ref name=mysterydungeon> {{cite web|url=http://serebii.net/mysteriousdungeon/partners.shtml|title=List of Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon in Pok<U+00E9>mon Mysterious Dungeon|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref>

==In the Pok<U+00E9>mon anime==
[[Image:Brocksavesmudkip.jpg|right|thumb|Brock saving Mudkip prior to capturing it during Episode 301. "A Mudkip Mission".]]

The [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' anime]] [[television program|series]] and [[film]]s are a set of adventures separate from most other versions of ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'', featuring [[Ash Ketchum]] as the main character, and various companions that accompany him through the lands of [[Kanto (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Kanto]], [[Johto]] and Hoenn. During the Hoenn adventures, [[Brock (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Brock]], a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon breeding|Pok<U+00E9>mon breeder]] and former [[Pok<U+00E9>mon gym|Gym leader]] who travels with protagonist Ash Ketchum, obtains a Mudkip in [[Dewford Town]] during Episode 301. "A Mudkip Mission". As Ash and his companions climb a waterfall, they come across a group of young Mudkip, Brock rescues a young Mudkip from being washed away in a stream. Brock's [[Lotad]] and Mudkip work together to defeat [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]], at which point the Mudkip decides to join Brock's team.<ref name=anime>{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/anime/epiguide/houen/301.shtml|publisher=Serebii.net|title=Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon Anime; Episode 301 - A Mudkip Mission|accessdate=2006-06-04}}</ref>

Mudkip's primary role is to assist Brock during water related situations, such as searching for objects in the ocean, such as an [[Illumise]] and a pearl belonging to a [[Spoink]].<ref name=illumise>{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/anime/epiguide/houen/318.shtml|title=Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon Anime; Episode 318 - Love At First Flight|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref><ref name=pearls> {{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/anime/epiguide/houen/355.shtml|title=Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon Anime Episode 355 - Pearls Are a Spoink's Best Friend|publisher=Serebii.net|accessdate=2006-06-09}}</ref> Mudkip also guides the Pok<U+00E9>mon when Brock, Ash and [[May (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|May]] aren't around. It evolves into [[Marshtomp]] during Episode 425, entitled "Mudkip & Flaafy! Wonder Drug of Love!".<ref name=evolve>{{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/anime/epiguide/kanto/425.shtml|title=Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon Anime; Episode 425 - Mudkip & Flaaffy!

A separate Mudkip also appears in Episode 281 "In the Knicker of Time!", when the group meet a trainer called Nicolai, a young trainer, who is training his first Pok<U+00E9>mon, Mudkip, which later defeats May's Torchic in a battle. Nicolai connects with his Pok<U+00E9>mon in battle by dressing up in a suit resembling his Pok<U+00E9>mon, wearing both Mudkip and Zigzagoon outfits in the episode.<ref name=othermudkip>{{cite web|url=http://serebii.net/anime/epiguide/houen/281.shtml|title=Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon anime; Episode 281.

==In the TCG==
[[Image:Mudkipstar.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Mudkip (as "Mudkip Star") in the ''Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game'' (EX Team Rocket Returns set).]]
The ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]'' is a [[Collectible card game|collectable card game]] first published by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in [[North America]], in 1999. The concept is similar to that of a Pok<U+00E9>mon battle in the video games in that each player takes turns to hit the opponent<U+2019>s Pok<U+00E9>mon. In the card game, Mudkip is a Water-type Basic pok<U+00E9>mon, just like its video game counterparts. As a basic pok<U+00E9>mon, it can be played in a battle, as the competitions of the card game are called, without the use of a special card. If the player has a [[Marshtomp]] card in their hand, they can play it on top of the Mudkip card, which is the card game's equivalent of evolving.

Mudkip has appeared several times in the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game]]''. It has appeared in the sets ''EX Ruby & Sapphire'' (two different cards), ''EX Dragon'', and ''EX Emerald''. It also appears in ''EX Team Rocket Returns'', but as "Mudkip Star".<ref name=deckdex> {{cite web|url=http://www.psypokes.com/dex/deckdex.php?id=258|title=List of Mudkip's Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game appearances|publisher=Psypokes.com|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref> This card is different then the other Mudkip cards in that it is rarer than the rest of the cards in the set.<ref name=star>{{cite web|url=http://www.shuffleandcut.com/content/page/game/game/9/edition/dig:Mudkip+Star/card/20521/EX%20Team%20Rocket%20Returns%20Mudkip+%22star%22.html|title=Trading Card information of Mudkip Star|publisher=Shuffleandcut.com|accessdate=2006-06-18}}</ref>

One rule when playing with ''Star'' cards <U+2014> including ''Mudkip Star'' from the ''EX Team Rocket Returns'' set <U+2014> is that Pok<U+00E9>mon with significant terms in their titles (often used to denote Pok<U+00E9>mon that are all part of one set) can only evolve into Pok<U+00E9>mon that also share this term. Though there is no mention on how to evolve ''Star Pok<U+00E9>mon'', if the rule for other [[suffix]]es is followed, ''Mudkip Star'' could only be replaced by a Marshtomp card with ''Star'' in its title <U+2014> a card which, at this point, does not exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-tcg.com/p_strategy/rulebooks/book_77.jsp#1069|title=Pok<U+00E9>mon Trading Card Game Rulebook on Illegal Evolutions|publisher=Pok<U+00E9>mon-tcg.com|accessdate=2006-04-13}}</ref> However, since players can only have one "Pok<U+00E9>mon ''Star''" card in their deck, then they couldn't evolve ''Mudkip Star'' into ''Marshtomp Star''. This makes ''Star'' cards somewhat impractical, since they cannot be upgraded from their Basic stage state; they are primarily savoured for their rarity instead.<ref name=star/>

==In the manga==
[[Ruby (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Ruby]], the male protagonist in ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures]]'' during the arc based off of Pok<U+00E9>mon Ruby and Sapphire, obtains a Mudkip named Zuzu as his Starter Pok<U+00E9>mon from [[Professor Birch]]. Ruby is a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon coordinator]], a person who uses their Pok<U+00E9>mon for [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Contest|contests]] rather than battles, and uses Zuzu in those contests. Zuzu evolved into a [[Marshtomp]] unexpectedly while Ruby was in [[Slateport City]], and again into a [[Swampert]], while training near [[Fortree City]]. Zuzu was first used to battle in "Chapter 183 VS. Torchic", against [[Sapphire (Pok<U+00E9>mon)|Sapphire]], his rival in the manga.<ref name=mangamudkip> {{cite web|url=http://www.serebii.net/manga/rs/183.shtml|title=Synopsis of Pok<U+00E9>mon Adventures Manga; '' Chapter 183.
