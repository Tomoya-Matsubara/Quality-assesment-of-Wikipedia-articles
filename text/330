'''Charles Allen Thomas''' (February 15, 1900 <U+2013> March 29, 1982) was a noted American chemist and businessman, and an important figure in the [[Manhattan Project]]. He held over 100 patents. 

A graduate of [[Transylvania College]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Thomas worked as a research chemist at [[General Motors]]  as part of a team researching [[antiknock agent]]s. This led to the development of [[tetraethyllead]],  which was widely used in motor fuels for many decades. In 1926, he and [[Carroll A. "Ted" Hochwalt]] co-founded Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in [[Dayton, Ohio]], with Thomas as president of the company. It was acquired by [[Monsanto]] in 1936, and Thomas would spend the rest of his career with Monsanto, rising to become its president in 1950, and chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965. He researched the chemistry of [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[polymer]]s, and developed the proton theory of [[aluminium chloride]], which helped explain a variety of chemical reactions, publishing  a book on the subject in 1941.

From 1943 to 1945, he coordinated Manhattan Project work on [[plutonium]] purification and production. He also coordinated development of techniques to industrially refine [[polonium]] for use with [[beryllium]] in the triggers of atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project's [[Dayton Project]], part of which was conducted on the estate of his wife's family. Shortly before the war ended, he took over the management of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Clinton Laboratories]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. Monsanto pulled out of Oak Ridge in December 1947, but became the operator of the [[Mound Laboratories]] in 1948. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] appointed Thomas to serve on a 1946 panel to appraise international atomic inspection, which culminated in the [[Acheson<U+2013>Lilienthal Report]]. In 1953 he was appointed as a consultant to the [[National Security Council]], and served as U.S. Representative to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]].

==Early life==
Charles Allen Thomas was born on a farm in [[Scott County, Kentucky]], the son of a [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], Charles Allen, and his wife Frances Carrick Thomas. His father died when he was six months old, and he and his mother went to live with his grandmother in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], just across the street from  [[Transylvania College]].{{sfn|Landau|1984|pp=279<U+2013>280}} While living on the farm he was home schooled by his mother and grandmother. After moving to Lexington he attended [[Hamilton College (Kentucky)|Hamilton College]]'s [[university-preparatory school|preparatory school]], and then [[Henry Clay High School|Morton High School]]. When he was 16, he entered Transylvania College, which awarded him his [[Bachelor of Arts]] (AB) degree in 1920. During [[World War I]], he served in the Student Army Training Corps, and for a time was a rifle instructor at [[Camp Perry]]. He then entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), from which he received an [[Master of Science]] (MS) degree, majoring in [[chemistry]], in 1924. To help pay for his tuition, he worked as a professional singer,  and for a time he considered a career as a vocalist.{{sfn|Landau|1984|pp=279<U+2013>280}} His singing voice was described by his son as a high [[baritone]].{{sfn|Bird|1994|pp=339<U+2013>340}}

In 1923 [[Charles F. Kettering]] and [[Carroll A. "Ted" Hochwalt]] recruited Thomas to work as a research chemist at [[General Motors]] (GM). There, he worked with [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]], as part of Kettering's team researching [[antiknock agent]]s. This led to the development of [[tetraethyllead]],  which was used in motor fuels for many years before being banned in most parts of the world as a poison. At General Motors, Thomas also worked on a process for extracting [[bromine]] from [[sea water]], and with Midgely on making [[synthetic rubber]] from [[isoprene]]. Thomas left General Motors in 1924 for a job as a research chemist, a joint venture between GM and [[Esso]] to make and sell tetraethyllead gasoline additives.{{sfn|Bird|1994|pp=340<U+2013>341}}<ref>{{cite news |title=The Secret History of Lead |date=March 20, 2000 |first=Jamie Lincoln |last=Kitman |newspaper=[[The Nation]] }}</ref>

Thomas married Margaret Stoddard Talbott, the sister of [[Harold E. Talbott|Harold E. Talbott, Jr.]] on September 25, 1926.{{sfn|Shirk |1995|p=433}} They had four children: Charles Allen Thomas III, Margaret Talbott, Frances Carrick, and Katharine Tudor.{{sfn|Bird|1994|p=348}} That year, he and Hochwalt co-founded Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in [[Dayton, Ohio]], with Thomas as president of the company. The company carried out research for various companies, looking into such diverse subjects as a fire extinguisher that would not freeze in unheated buildings, and a means to speed up the aging of whiskey. Their work attracted the attention of [[Edgar Monsanto Queeny]], the chairman of [[Monsanto]],who bought Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories  for $1.4 million in Monsanto stock in 1936. Queeny moved Thomas to [[St Louis, Missouri]], where he became director of Central Research, while Hochwalt remained in Dayton to work on Acrilan, Monsanto's [[acrylic fiber]].{{sfn|Bird|1994|pp=340<U+2013>341}}{{sfn|Landau|1984|pp=279<U+2013>280}}

Thomas would spend the rest of his career with Monsanto, becoming a member of its board of directors in 1942, vice president in 1943, executive vice president in 1947, president in 1950, and ultimately chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965. He subsequently  served as chairman of Monsanto's Finance Committee frm 1965 to 1968. He retired in 1970.<ref name="obit">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 31, 1982 |last=Bird |first=David |title=Charles Thomas, ex-Chairman of Monsanto }}</ref>{{sfn|Bird|1994|p=342}} In this time, Monsanto's annual sales grew from $34 million to $1.9 billion, and its expenditure on research from $6.2 million to 101.4 million.{{sfn|Landau|1984|pp=280<U+2013>281}} He researched the chemistry of [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[polymer]]s. In studying the chemical reactions between [[alkene]]s and [[diene]]s, particularly in the presence of an [[aluminium chloride]] [[catalyst]], he developed the proton theory of aluminium chloride, which helped explain a variety of chemical reactions, including [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], [[polymerization]] and [[dehydrogenation]]. This research culminated in the publication of his book ''Anhydrous Aluminum Chloride in Organic Chemistry'' in 1941.{{sfn|Bird|1994|p=342}}

==Manhattan Project==
In December 1942, during [[World War II]], Thomas joined the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) as the Deputy Chief of its Division 8, which was responsible for propellants, explosives and the like.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=88}}  Early in 1943, he travelled to the East with [[Richard Tolman]], a member of the NDRC,  and [[James B. Conant]], the president of [[Harvard University]] and the chairman of the NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas's background. Thomas was then invited to a meeting in Washington DC with [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], and, as he discovered when he got there, Conant.{{sfn|Stewart|1948|p=7}}{{sfn|Hochwalt|Haring|1947|p=2.1}}<ref name=Building>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Dayton Daily News]] |date=September 18, 1983 |url=http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/building_the_bomb_in_oakw.html |title=Building the Bomb in Oakwood |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref>

Groves and Conant were hoping to harness his industrial expertise for the benefit of the project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=237}} They offered him a post as a deputy to [[Robert Oppenheimer]], at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/george-mahfouzs-interview |title=George Mahfouz's Interview |publisher=Manhattan Project Voices |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref> Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the [[plutonium]] purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in Chicago, [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Radiation laboratory]] in Berkeley, and [[Ames Laboratory]] in Iowa.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=237}} Monsanto's Central Research Department began to conduct research on behalf of the Manhattan Project as part of the Manhattan Project's [[Dayton Project]], some of which was conducted on the estate of his wife's family.{{sfn|Moyer|1956|p=vii}}<ref name=DeBrosse>{{cite news|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php/component/content/83.html?task=view|title=The Dayton Project|first=Jim|last=DeBrosse|newspaper=Dayton Daily News |date= December 6, 2004|page=A1}}</ref>

Initially, there were concerns about the purity of plutonium, an element about which little was known, but Thomas was able to report to Groves and Conant in June 1944 that techniques had been developed that would yield highly pure plutonium, and that the problem was solved.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=244}} Unfortunately, experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr<U+00E8>]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on reactor-produced plutonium showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]], which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than [[plutonium-239]], making it unsuitable for use in the [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] [[gun-type nuclear weapon]] design.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}}

Thomas attended a series of crisis meetings in Chicago with Connant, Groves, [[Arthur Compton]], [[Kenneth Nichols]] and [[Enrico Fermi]]. It was agreed that the isotopes could not be separated, so high purity plutonium would not be required. Thomas therefore decided to disband his plutonium purification team.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=251}} The Los Alamos laboratory then turned to the technologically much more difficult task of building an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}}

Monsanto was already working on a key component of the device. In April 1943, [[Robert Serber]] had proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the bomb should be triggered by a [[neutron initiator]]. The best-known neutron sources were [[radium]]-[[berrylium]] and [[polonium]]-berrylium. The later was chosen as it had a 140-day [[half life]], which made it intense enough to be useful but long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas brought in Monsanto to work on the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the [[Urchin (detonator)|urchin detonators]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=119<U+2013>125}}<ref name=DeBrosse>{{cite news|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php/component/content/83.html?task=view|title=The Dayton Project|first=Jim|last=DeBrosse|work=Dayton Daily News |date=2004-12-05|page=A1}}</ref>

Thomas established the project in the Runnymede Playhouse on the grounds of his wife's family estate in a wealthy residential section of [[Oakwood, Montgomery County, Ohio|Oakwood]], a suburb of Dayton.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/local/dayton-still-pushing-for-national-park-to-note-rol/nM8yx/ |title= Dayton still pushing for national park to note role in Manhattan |newspaper=Dayton Daily News |first=Jim|last=DeBrosse |date=7 February 2010|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref> He promised his mother-in-law that he would return the Runnymede Playhouse building to the family intact after the war, but he was unable to keep this promise because the building became so badly contaminated with radioactivity. The facility, also known as Dayton Unit IV, was in use for nuclear work until 1949 when [[Mound Laboratories]] opened in [[Miamisburg, Ohio]]. The Playhouse was dismantled in 1950, and buried in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo Division |url=http://www.lrb.usace.army.mil/Missions/HTRW/FUSRAP/DaytonSites.aspx |title=Dayton Sites |accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>

Thomas was one of a number of scientists who watched their work come to fruition on July 16, 1945, at the [[Trinity nuclear test]].{{sfn|Landau|1984|p=281}} For his work on the project, he received the [[Medal for Merit]] from the [[President of the United States|president]] [[Harry S. Truman]] in 1946.{{sfn|Bird|1994|pp=345<U+2013>346}} On May 2, 1945, Groves and Thomas agreed that Monsanto would take over the running of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Clinton laboratories]] at Oak Ridge, Tennessee from July 1, 1945.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=210}}  Thomas brought in some 60 new staff from Dayton to help run the Clinton Laboratories, and he persuaded [[Eugene Wigner]] to come from Chicago to work on new reactor designs. Under Wigner, the Laboratories made a pioneering study of [[Wigner's disease]], the swelling and distortion of the [[graphite]] used as a moderator in reactors due the neutron bombardment produced in a reactor. Thomas became frustrated with restrictions on spending and the uncertainty about the future of the laboratory. In May 1947, he decided not to renew the contract with the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] to operate the Clinton Laboratories on a month-to-month basis while a new operator was found. Union Carbide took over the contract in December 1947. Monsanto was, however, given the contract to operate the new Mound Laboratories in early 1948.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Chapter 2: High-Flux Years |journal=Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review  |url=http://web.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter2.shtml |year=2002 |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |volume=24 |issue=3 and 4}}</ref>

==Later life==
In 1946 [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] appointed Thomas to serve on a panel with Robert Oppenheimer, [[David Lilienthal]], [[Chester I. Barnard]] and [[Harry Winne]] to appraise international atomic inspection, culminating in the [[Acheson<U+2013>Lilienthal Report]]. In 1951 Truman appointed Thomas to the [[President's Science Advisory Committee|Science Advisory Committee]], an eleven-man committee of prominent scientists to advise on defense planning. In 1953 President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] appointed him a scientific consultant to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and he was the U.S. Representative to the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]].{{sfn|Bird|1994|p=344}} In the wake of the [[Sputnik crisis]], Thomas was part of a group that persuaded [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Neil H. McElroy]] to establish [[DARPA]].{{sfn|Landau|1984|p=282}}

Thomas served as a trustee of the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] and the [[Universities Research Association]], a curator of Transylvania College, chairman of the board of trustees of Washington University, a member of the Corporation that runs MIT, and the chairman of the board of directors of the [[Washington University Medical Center]]. He was also member of the board of directors of several companies, including Chemstrand Corporation, [[Southwestern Bell]], St. Louis Union Trust, the First National Bank in St. Louis, the Central Institute for the Deaf, [[Metropolitan Life Insurance]], [[RAND Corporation]] and the Civic Center Redevelopment Corporation of St. Louis. He was involved with organizations including the [[Boy Scouts of America]], [[Radio Free Europe]] and the St Louis Research Council.{{sfn|Landau|1984|pp=283<U+2013>284}}{{sfn|Bird|1994|p=345}}

Thomas was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] at age forty-eight and was one of the founding members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/About/leadership/57773.aspx |title=Founding members of the National Academy of Engineering |publisher=[[National Academy of Engineering]] |accessdate={{Format date|2012|10|21}}}}</ref> He was also a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name="obit"/> In addition, he received over 100 patents, the [[Industrial Research Institute]] [[IRI Medal|Medal]] in 1947, the [[American Institute of Chemists]]' Gold Medal in 1948, the Missouri Award for Distinguished Service in Engineering in 1952, the [[Society of Chemical Industry]]'s [[Perkin Medal]] in 1953, the [[American Chemical Society]] [[Priestley Medal]] in 1955, the Societe de Chimie Industrielle Palladium Medal in 1963, the American Academy of Achievement Gold Plate Award in 1965, and the [[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]] Man of the Year award in 1966.{{sfn|Bird|1994|pp=345<U+2013>346}}

Thomas was concerned that the United States did not spend enough money on basic research. To this end he donated $600,000 to [[Washington University in St. Louis]] as an endowment for a chair, the Charles Allen Thomas Professor of Chemistry.{{sfn|Landau|1984|p=282}} He rejected the notion large corporations as being driven solely or mainly by greed. In a 1952 speech he enjoined his fellow businessmen to "remember that our businesses and their profits are only a means to an end, a means toward making Americans happier and America a stronger and more unified nation."<ref name="obit"/>

In retirement, Thomas spent much of his time managing Magnolia Plantation, a {{convert|15000|acre|adj=on}} family farm near [[Albany, Georgia]], where he employed a staff of 50 and grew [[peanut]]s, [[pecan]]s, [[soybean]]s, [[corn]] and [[timber]].{{sfn|Landau|1984|p=282}} His first wife died in 1975, and he married Margaret Chandler Porter in 1980. He died at his farm on March 29, 1982. He was survived by his second wife and four children.{{sfn|Bird|1994|p=348}} His papers are collected at Washington University.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archon.wulib.wustl.edu/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=496 |publisher=[[Washington University in St. Louis]] |title=Charles Allen Thomas Papers, 1916<U+2013>1977 |accessdate=January 25, 2014}}</ref>
