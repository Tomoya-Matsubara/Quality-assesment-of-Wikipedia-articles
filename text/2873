'''Carabane''', also known as '''Karabane''', is an island and a village located in the extreme south-west of [[Senegal]], in the mouth of the [[Casamance River]]. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a [[shoal]] and [[alluvium]] to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the [[mangrove]] trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of [[Ziguinchor Region]], Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a [[dry season]] and a [[wet season]]. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are [[mango]]s and oranges. Although the nearby [[Basse Casamance National Park]] and [[Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve]] have been closed for years because of the [[Casamance Conflict]], Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.

The earliest known inhabitants of the island were the [[Jola people]], the ethnic group which is still the most populous on the island. The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were active in the region from the 16th century onwards; however, they did not linger on "Mosquito Island," the mosquitoes and [[Simulium|black flies]] convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of [[Ziguinchor]] instead in 1645. On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of [[Kagnout]] in return for an annual payment of 196&nbsp;francs. A series of treaties between the French and the leaders of the local peoples ensued; however, the inhabitants of Carabane did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them, resulting in lootings and abductions among French rice farmers by the [[Karoninka people]]. In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with [[S<U+00E9>dhiou]] in 1886. Since {{nowrap|World War II}}, the population of the island has gradually declined for a variety of reasons including periods of drought, the Casamance Conflict and, more recently, the sinking of the ''[[MV Le Joola|Joola]]'' in 2002. Because the ''Joola'' was the primary means of travel to and from Carabane, much of the village's ability to trade and receive tourists has been lost.

Although Carabane was once a regional capital, the village has since become so politically isolated from the rest of the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally [[Animism|animist]], but although the sacred groves and [[Fetishism|fetishes]] survive as cultural icons of [[Casamance]], the [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] belief systems of [[Roman Catholicism in Senegal|Catholicism]] and [[Islam in Senegal|Islam]] have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as [[Elinkine]] to continue their studies.

The testimonies of explorers and [[List of colonial heads of French S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal|colonial administrators]] demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and [[palm wine]] production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population. [[Palm oil]] and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by [[artisan fishing]], which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.

==Toponymy==
The [[etymology]] of Carabane remains unclear. It could be connected to the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] word ''karaban<U+00E9>'', which means "who speaks a lot," or possibly the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] words ''casa'' and ''Kaban'', which mean "house" and "finish," respectively. According to this hypothesis, the name means the place "where the houses are finished," a possible allusion to the fact that this village was the first French capital in Basse Casamance.<ref>{{fr}} Thomas (July 1956), p. 79.</ref> According to other sources,<ref name=Radio-Canada>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/dossiers/chroniques-monde/Carabane.shtml|title=<U+00AB> De l'autre c<U+00F4>t<U+00E9> de la rivi<U+00E8>re <U+00BB>|publisher=Radio-Canada|author=Sophie-H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne Lebeuf|accessdate=June 23, 2008}}</ref> the name comes from ''karam akam'', which means "the other side of the river." These uncertainties are augmented by the instability of the spelling: Karabane with an initial K suggests a [[Jola languages|Jola]] or Wolof origin, while Carabane with a C would suggest a Latin derivation, most probably through Portuguese or [[French language|French]].<ref group=notes>More rarely, one may find the spelling ''Karaban'' (notably in English and German sources) or ''Karabanne'' (particularly in Spanish and Portuguese sources).</ref>

With a total area of {{convert|57|km2}}, Carabane is the last major island in the mouth of the [[Casamance River]] in south-west Senegal. It is situated 12<U+00B0>&nbsp;32'&nbsp;N latitude and 16<U+00B0>&nbsp;43'&nbsp;W longitude and is, by way of [[Elinkine]], nearly {{convert|60|km}} away from [[Ziguinchor]], the capital of the [[Ziguinchor Region|region of the same name]], and a little over {{convert|500|km}} from Dakar, the country's capital.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url= http://www.planete-senegal.com/visites/carabane.php|title=Visite de Carabane|publisher=Plan<U+00E8>te S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>

===Climate===
The tropical climate of Basse Casamance cycles between a [[dry season]] and a [[wet season]], which usually starts in June and ends in October.<ref>{{fr}} Bergen and Manga (1999), pp. 13&ndash;14.</ref> Because of the proximity to the ocean, the humidity of the air remains above 40% and contributes to the abundance of vegetation.

In recent decades, there has been a general decline in rainfall, which threatens rice production, increases soil salinity, and contributes to the degradation of the mangroves. In May and June, air temperature is around {{convert|28|C|F}}. In January and February, the coldest months, it is around {{convert|24|C|F}}. Temperatures of below {{convert|18|C|F}} are quite rare.

===Flora===
[[Image:Carabane-Mangrove.JPG|thumb|alt=A cluster of mangroves with water on the left and sand on the right|Mangroves are all-pervasive on the island.]]
At one time, the island was considered an arid location,<ref name="Casamance et Mellacor<U+00E9>e"/> where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce.<ref>{{fr}} Marche (1879), p. 54.</ref> In what has become a tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious to attract the attention of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator [[Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9>]] submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island.<ref>{{fr}}  Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> (May&ndash;June 1849), pp. 398&ndash;422.</ref> Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.<ref>Mark (2002), p. 182.</ref>

Most of Carabane is covered in mangroves, forming an impassible jungle that can only be crossed in constructed passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of [[Gas diffusion in soil|oxygen in the soil]] is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent.<ref>{{fr}} Marius (1976), pp. 669&ndash;691.</ref> There are various reasons for the degradation, including [[crustacean]]s and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.ideecasamance.org/intro_education.pdf|title=<U+00C9>ducation <U+00E0> l'environnement mangrovien pour <U+00E9>coles <U+00E9>l<U+00E9>mentaires|publisher=Id<U+00E9>e Casamance|date=2006?|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref>

While not as plentiful as in other parts of Basse Casamance such as [[Mlomp]], [[kapok]] trees are nonetheless present. Their grey wood is very light and easy to work, for which reasons it is used to construct many items, ranging from doors to [[Dugout (boat)|dugouts]]. Jola canoes, which range from {{convert|6|to|8|m}} in length, are carved by [[adze]]s entirely out of one tree each, unlike the traditional Senegalese pirogue.<ref>{{fr}} Berghen and Manga (1999), p. 120.</ref>

As for fruit trees, [[mango]]s and oranges are the most populous. [[Opuntia ficus-indica|Prickly pears]], [[Delonix regia|flamboyants]], and colourful [[bougainvillea]]s brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations have contributed to the [[deforestation]] of the island.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://c.s.f.free.fr/spip.php?article3|title=Le probl<U+00E8>me <U+00E9>cologique et humain|publisher= Club sans fronti<U+00E8>re|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref>

===Fauna===
[[Image:Carabane-Gu<U+00EA>pierNain.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bird perched among mangrove branches|A variety of bird species, such as the [[Little Bee-eater]], may be viewed among the mangroves on the island.]]
The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While [[Basse Casamance National Park]] and [[Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve]] have not been open for years due to the [[Casamance Conflict]], Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: [[African Darter]] (''Anhinga rufa''), [[Goliath Heron]] (''Ardea goliath''), [[Palm-nut Vulture]] (''Gypohierax angolensis''), [[Black-tailed Godwit]] (''Limosa limosa''), [[Whimbrel]] (''Numenius phaeopus''), [[Eurasian Curlew]] (''Numenius arquata''), [[Caspian Tern]] (''Sterna caspia''), [[Blue-spotted Wood-dove]] (''Turtur afer''), [[Red-eyed Dove]] (''Streptopelia semitorquata''), [[White-rumped Swift]] (''Apus caffer''), [[Woodland Kingfisher]] (''Halcyon senegalensis''), [[Grey-backed Camaroptera]] (''Camaroptera brachyura''), [[Red-bellied Paradise-flycatcher]] (''Terpsiphone rufiventer''), [[Pied Crow]] (''Corvus albus''), [[Black-rumped Waxbill]] (''Estrilda troglodytres'') and [[Yellow-fronted Canary]] (''Serinus mozambicus'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.camacdonald.com/birding/tripreports/Senegal98.html|title=List of Birds Observed in the Senegal|author=Tina MacDonald|accessdate=January 19, 2009}}</ref><ref name= Barlow>Barlow ''et al''. (1997).  Page 3 gives an overview of the birds typical of the coastal and riverine habitats, and the ranges of the listed birds are found under their species' accounts.</ref>

Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter [[Carangidae|trevallies]] (''Carangidae''), [[Giant African threadfin]]s (''Polydactylus quadrifilis''), [[Great barracuda]]s (''Sphyraena barracuda''), or [[African red snapper]]s (''Lutjanus agennes''). The [[mangrove]]s are home to many crustaceans such as [[southern pink shrimp]] (''Farfantepenaeus notialis''), [[Uca pugilator|sand fiddler crabs]] (''Uca pugilator''), and [[Mollusca|molluscs]]. The shellfish population consists mostly of [[mangrove oyster]]s (''Crassostrea gasar''), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The [[Agama agama|Red-headed agama]] and the [[monitor lizard]] make up the reptilian population of the island.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.kassoumay.com/carabane/visite-carabane.html|title=<U+00AB> <U+00C0> voir et <U+00E0> visiter sur Carabane <U+00BB>|publisher=Kassoumay|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref>

The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the [[Bainuk people]] and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the [[Jola people|Jola]].<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 21.</ref><ref>{{fr}} Benoist (2008), p. 160.</ref> [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of [[wax]], [[ivory]], and [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]]. They did not linger on "Mosquito Island," instead founding their first [[trading post]] at [[Ziguinchor]] in 1645.<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 67.</ref>

In the late 1820s,<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 77.</ref> a [[mulatto]] trader from [[Gor<U+00E9>e]], Pierre Baudin, moved to Carabane and began planting rice and producing [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in ovens. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the [[British people|British]] in [[The Gambia]]. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its [[Abolitionism|abolition]] in the [[French colonial empire]] in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.<ref>Klein (1998), p. 30.</ref>

The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gor<U+00E9>e were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the [[African slave trade|slave trade]], and also because of their competition with [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gor<U+00E9>e, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of [[Diogue]], on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), pp. 76&ndash;77.</ref><!-- ref cites entire paragraph -->

===French colonization===
On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of [[Kagnout]] at an annual cost of 196 francs.<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 76.</ref> Still, another treaty made [[S<U+00E9>dhiou]] the primary trading post of [[Casamance]], and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. Each successively took on the title of Resident. With this official but ambiguous title, they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France.<ref>{{fr}} Saint-Martin (2000), p. 126.</ref>

When Jean Baudin fell into disgrace due to a serious incident involving an English ship, he was replaced as Resident in October 1849 by [[Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9>]].<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), pp. 82&ndash;83.</ref> This multilingual, enterprising businessman and [[Entomology|entomologist]] from [[Nantes]] transformed "his" island, sparking a resurgence of commercial and political activity. In 1852, the population surpassed 1,000 inhabitants. A [[cadastre|cadastral map]] assigned tracts of {{convert|30|m2}} to traders and contractors. Other tracts of {{convert|15|m2}} were allotted for housing. Provisional concessions were granted to residents of Saint-Louis and Gor<U+00E9>e. Other than settlers, the island was mainly inhabited by animist Jola famers, whose practices were disconcerting to the settlers.  Coexistence was not always easy. Christianity was practiced by the Europeans and some of the residents of Gor<U+00E9>e, although the island did not yet have a church. Missionaries tried but were not permitted to settle on the island.<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 37.</ref><!-- ref cites preceding two sentences -->

The construction of a wharf {{convert|116|m}} long allowed the berthing of larger vessels coming in from Casamance.<ref name="Casamance et Mellacor<U+00E9>e"/> A railed pier was built along the river in order to facilitate the transfer of goods. Carabane exported rice, but also [[cotton]], considered to be of poor quality,<ref name=RevueMaritime>{{fr}} Vallon (February&ndash;March 1862, p. 465.</ref> which was [[Cotton gin|ginned]] in a factory built by Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> in 1840, owned first by [[Maurel & Prom]] and then by the Casamance Company.<ref name=RevueMaritime/> The factory also produced [[almond]]s and [[Carapa|crabwood]] (''Carapa procera'').<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 87.</ref>

Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> became involved in local African politics during his time as Resident. When an intertribal conflict led to an armed raid of Carabane, he mediated the conflict. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock [[Raid (military)|raid]] which precipitated further incidents the following year. In response to this conflict with the former owners of Carabane, the residents of Kagnout, Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> convinced the [[List of colonial heads of French S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal|governor of Senegal]] to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders. This single ship failed to faze the island's opponants, therefore Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor. When these reinforcements arrived from Gor<U+00E9>e, the conflict was successfully ended. A treaty was signed on March 25, establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance, but also in Kagnout and [[Samatit]].<ref>{{fr}} Clerq (1987).</ref> For his involvement in the conflict, Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> was accepted into the ''[[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur]]'' and was given a [[Concession (territory)|land consession]].<ref> Aldrich (1996), p. 37.</ref> Bertrand-Bocand<U+00E9> left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence, but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860. His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island.<ref>{{fr}} Saint-Martin (1989), p. 186.</ref>

Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the [[Karoninka people]]. Troops led by [[<U+00C9>mile Pinet-Laprade]] attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period of calm ensued. While the [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements.<ref>{{fr}} Saint-Martin (1989), p. 457.</ref>

In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with S<U+00E9>dhiou in 1886. Its garrison of a dozen men was regularly stricken with tropical diseases such as [[malaria]]. In 1877, 527 people were counted on the island, mostly Jola, but also some [[Wolof people|Wolof]]s, Muslims, and a few [[Manjack people|Manjacks]] from [[Portuguese Guinea]].<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), pp. 180&ndash;181.</ref><!-- ref cites entire paragraph -->

The first Catholic mission in S<U+00E9>dhiou was founded in 1875 and the first [[baptism]]s were celebrated that same year in Carabane. There were 17 people baptised in total, most of whom were residents of the island. The mission in Carabane was founded in 1880. On February 22, Father Kiffer settled on the island, but he served for only two years.<ref>{{fr}} Benoist (2008), p. 196.</ref> The staff of the colonial administration was small: the manager of a customs post with four employees, a [[Artillery|gunner]], a [[corporal]], and six European [[tirailleur]]s. There were approximately 250 Christians in Carabane, mostly [[mulatto]]s. The priest built his house out of [[Borassus|Palmyra Palm]] trunks. He visited nearby villages and sometimes went to S<U+00E9>dhiou. The founding of the mission in Carabane was followed by others in [[Ziguinchor]] (1888), [[Elinkine]] (1891), and several nearby locations in the 20th century. In 1900, a [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Spiritan]] missionary, Father Wintz,<ref group=notes>In 1909, Father Wintz wrote a French<U+2014>Jola dictionary published by the Elinkine Mission, and reedited in 1968.</ref> wrote the first [[catechism]] in the [[Jola language]].<ref name="Jordi Tom<U+00E0>s i Guilera 2005 305">{{ca}} Tom<U+00E0>s i Guilera (2005), p. 305.</ref>

Temporarily transferred to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, it was still not large enough to accommodate all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, [[Magloire-D<U+00E9>sir<U+00E9> Barthet]], and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic [[feast day]] of [[Saint Anne]] in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many [[catechumen]].<ref name="Joseph Roger de Benoist 2008 253"/>

Competition between the French and the Portuguese began to show itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in [[Cacheu]] and [[Farim]] asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and [[Seju]], the Portuguese lost many traders to the French.<ref>Barry (1998), p. 221.</ref> This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was negotiated in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain [[Henri Brosselard-Faidherbe|Brosselard-Faidherbe]].

In 1901, the administrative capital of Casamance was transferred from Carabane to Ziguinchor, a status which was transferred in turn to [[Oussouye Department|Oussouye]] two years later. By 1904, Carabane had lost several of its amenities, including its customs services, which were centralized. The island's trading houses were abandoned and the number of Christians dwindled from 1,000 to 300 by 1907.<ref name="Joseph Roger de Benoist 2008 292">{{fr}} Benoist (2008), p. 292</ref>

Despite the [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] movement's growth in France at the time, education in Carabane continued to be administered by the Holy Ghost Fathers for the boys and by the [[Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny]] for the girls. A chapel also continued to be run on the island.

In 1913, just before the outbreak of {{nowrap|[[West Africa Campaign (World War I)|World War I]]}}, Carabane suffered a fire which caused its business to decline. People gradually left the island in search of work in Ziguinchor and even [[Dakar]].<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 322.</ref> On December 1915, [[Marcel de Coppet]], administrator of Ziguinchor, visited the island in order to recruit [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|tirailleurs]]. Six inhabitants of the island accepted the position: a Christian, a pagan, and four Muslims.<ref>{{fr}} Roche (2000), p. 328.</ref>

In the aftermath of the Great War, the [[Roman Catholicism in Senegal|Roman Catholic Church]] encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], [[Gor<U+00E9>e]], [[Rufisque]], [[Thi<U+00E8>s]], [[Ngazobil]], [[Joal]], [[Fadiouth]], [[Foundiougne]], [[Kaolack]], Ziguinchor, [[Bignona]] and [[Banjul]]. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of [[Islam in Senegal|Islam in the country]].<ref>{{fr}} Benoist (2008), pp. 324&ndash;325.</ref><!-- ref cites entire paragraph -->

In taking leadership of the [[diocese]], Archbishop [[Louis Le Hunsec|Le Hunsec]] noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, had lost its influence and now had fewer than 500&nbsp;inhabitants.<ref>{{fr}} Benoist (2008), p. 339.</ref> He considered transferring the mission to [[Oussouye Department|Oussouye]], which became a reality in 1927. Starting in 1937, the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane.<ref name="Jordi Tom<U+00E0>s i Guilera 2005 305"/>

In the same year, a [[reform school]] was created on the island, operating until 1953, when it was replaced by another in [[Nianing]].<ref>{{fr}} Thioub (1997), pp. 73-74</ref> A report submitted in 1938 by an educational advisor to Marcel de Coppet, Governor General of [[French West Africa]], detailed the daily life of the prisoners in the school which housed up to 22 boys, mostly convicted for theft but also occasionally for murder.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/savineau/reports/french/rapport17.rtf|title=Rapport n<U+00B0> 17 (La Casamance)|author=Denise Savigneau|publisher=Afrique occidentale fran<U+00E7>aise|date=May 1938|accessdate=January 19, 2009}}</ref>

===Recent history===
Carabane's population continued to decline gradually after {{nowrap|World War II}}. In 1950, the construction of a seminary was planned in Carabane,<ref>{{fr}} Benoist (2008), p. 410.</ref> but it was transferred to a new building in [[Nyassia]] in 1959. The Carabane mission closed its doors during the wet season of 1953, 83 years after its inception. The nuns and their interns moved to Ziguinchor.<ref>{{fr}} Thomas (April 1964), pp. 13&ndash;46.</ref>

[[History_of_Senegal#Independence|Senegal's independence]] was declared on August 20, 1960, and after the dissolution of the short-lived [[Mali Federation]], Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of [[drought]] that ravaged the [[Sahel]] in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew.<ref>{{fr}} Diatta (2008), pp. 160&ndash;161.</ref><!-- Citation covers entire paragraph -->

Discontent began to spread among the people, which sometimes escalated to violence. Casamance has since experienced years of [[Casamance Conflict|conflict]] which put local initiatives in jeopardy, such as nature reserves and the first network of villages.<ref>{{fr}} Scibilia (2003), p. 174.</ref> In 1998, in the middle of the conflict, the French commune of [[Bon-Encontre]] committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid, both economically and culturally. Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.<ref>{{ca}}  Tom<U+00E0>s i Guilera (2005), p. 414.</ref>

The [[ceasefire]] of 2004 brought relative peace, but in the meantime, the sinking of the ''[[MV Le Joola|Joola]]'' in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict and the sinking of the ''Joola'' along with the threat of [[coastal erosion]] on the island, some fear the worst.<ref name="catastrophe">{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://diembering-aadd.com/index.php?option=com_content%26task=view%26id=13%26Itemid=1|title=Qui pour sauver Diogu<U+00E9>-Nikine-Carabane?|author=Jacques Diatta|publisher=Association d'Aide au D<U+00E9>veloppement du Diembering|date=January 7, 2007|accessdate=November 19, 2009}}</ref> Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.<ref>{{fr}} Scibilia (2003), p. 40.</ref>

==Society==
===Administration===
[[Image:Oussouye66.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A white gate with a sign reading "Republique du Senegal: Prefecture d'Oussouye"|Oussouye Prefecture]]
Formerly an administrative district in its own right,<ref group=notes>Between 1939 and 1944, the colonial authorities of the AOF were [[Vichyite]]s and anti-[[Gaullism|Gaullists]], unlike those of the AEF, especially because of the [[governor]] of [[Chad]], [[F<U+00E9>lix <U+00C9>bou<U+00E9>]].</ref> even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23&nbsp;villages in the rural community of [[Diemb<U+00E9>ring (rural community)|Diemb<U+00E9>ring]], of which [[Kabrousse]], [[Cap Skirring]], and [[Boucott-Diemb<U+00E9>ring]] are the largest centres.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.pepam.gouv.sn/acces.php?idcr=02211|title=Communaut<U+00E9> rurale de Djemb<U+00E9>ring|publisher=Programme d'eau potable et d'assainissement du Mil<U+00E9>naire|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}</ref> This rural community is located in the [[Kabrousse Arrondissement]]. It is part of [[Oussouye Department]], the smallest and least central of the three departments in [[Ziguinchor Region]]. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council.<ref>{{fr}} Diop (2006), pp. 119&ndash;121.</ref> After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the [[List of Ministers of the Interior of Senegal|Minister of the Interior]]. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including [[Law enforcement in Senegal|law enforcement]], tax collection, and keeping of [[vital record]]s in the village.

While this administrative structure was decreed by a government anxious to deal with  [[Interlocutor (politics)|interlocutors]], such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance.<ref>{{fr}} Berghen and Manga (1999), pp. 21&ndash;22.</ref> Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy.<ref>Gregg and Trillo (2003), p. 246</ref> It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Paolo Palmeri,<ref>{{fr}} Palmeri (1995), pp. 53&ndash;55.</ref> the leader of the village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion, the real holders of power are the [[Fetishism|fetish]] [[priest]]s.<ref>{{fr}} Palmeri (1995), pp. 57&ndash;59.</ref> The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a [[clan]] or an aggregation of [[kinship]]. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of [[mound-building termites]], in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.<ref>{{fr}} Diatta (1996), p. 20.</ref>

===Population===
[[Image:<U+00C9>contine.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=The base of an upright string instrument showing three strings|An ''[[akonting]]'' is a Jola [[chordophone]].]]
In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households,<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.pepam.gouv.sn/acces.php?idloc=02211018|title=Localit<U+00E9> de Karabane|publisher=Programme d'eau potable et d'assainissement du Mil<U+00E9>naire|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref> but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources.<ref name=SEM/> Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major [[ethnic groups in Senegal]] by [[Jola language|their language]], egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery.<ref>{{fr}} Diouf (1998), p. 201.</ref> Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance,<ref>Linares (2007), p. 5.</ref> but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, [[Lebou people|Lebous]], and [[Serer people|Serers]] (including [[Niominka people|Niominka]] fishermen).<ref>{{fr}} Diouf (1998), p. 74.</ref> [[Manjack people|Manjacks]] also live on the island, some of whom came from [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] and [[Gor<U+00E9>e]] at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from [[Guinea]] (the [[Susu people]]) and the other from [[Guinea-Bissau]], have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: [[Ghana]]ians, Guineans, and [[The Gambia|Gambians]].<ref>{{fr}} ''Petit Fut<U+00E9> S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal'' (2008&ndash;2009), p. 211.</ref>

The indigenous population was originally [[Animism|animist]], but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to [[Rite of passage|initiation rites]] such as [[boukout]] survive as cultural icons of Casamance,<ref>{{fr}} Foucher (2002), p. 376.</ref> the [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] belief systems of [[Roman Catholicism in Senegal|Catholicism]] and [[Islam in Senegal|Islam]] have become the most widely held in Carabane.<ref name=SEM/> The 1988 consensus reported that [[Muslim]]s account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located.<ref>{{fr}} Dioug (1998), p. 117.</ref> Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from [[Dakar]], many of whom were Muslim.<ref>{{ca}} Tom<U+00E0>s i Guilera (2005), p. 322.</ref> The arrival of fishermen from heavily [[Islamization|Islamized]] communities has accentuated this trend.

===Education and health===
[[Image:Carabane-Femmes.JPG|thumb|left|alt=The outside of a beige building with children visible inside the open door|The [[kindergarten]] was founded in 1988.]]

Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the [[Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary]] began teaching classes for girls.

Carabane has a new primary school, <U+00C9>cole Fran<U+00E7>ois Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%.<ref name=SEM/> Students may continue their studies at the middle school in [[Elinkine]], the [[Aline Sitoe Diatta]] High School in [[Oussouye Department|Oussouye]], and then a university in either Dakar or [[Ziguinchor]]. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called "House of Women and Children," founded in 1988 under the auspices of [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] Ziguinchor.

The testimonies of explorers and [[List of colonial heads of French S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal|colonial administrators]] demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and [[palm wine]] production for centuries.<ref>{{fr}} Thomas (1958), pp. 79&ndash;90. </ref> The island experienced a decline in the 20th century, when Ziguinchor emerged as the regional capital, and more recently because of the negative economic consequences resulting from the Casamance Conflict and the ''Joola'' tragedy. Because of these recent difficulties, the sale of local products in the capital is only possible if they are transported first by boat and then by [[bush taxi]], a combined journey of 9<U+2013>12&nbsp;hours.<ref name=Radio-Canada/>  Carabane is seeking out new economic possibilities, particularly through the revival of tourism.

===Transportation and energy===
From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset. In the 20th and 21st&nbsp;centuries, in terms of trade and tourism issues, this location is more of a disadvantage because it effectively separates the island from the rest of the country.<ref name="Duigou"/> The problem was compounded by the [[The Gambia|Gambian]] [[enclave]] and the sinking of the ''Joola''.

While a direct route by sea has not been available since the sinking of the ''Joola'', the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some [[Roads in Senegal|national roads]] connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to [[Kaolack]]. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and [[Gambia River|the river]]), the former running through [[Nioro du Rip]] to [[Farafenni]], and the latter crossing the river to [[Banjul]]. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7&nbsp;p.m. and 10&nbsp;a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant [[demining]] operations.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/conseils-aux-voyageurs_909/pays_12191/senegal_12357/index.html

Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.

By boat, the distance between Dakar and Carabane is {{convert|265|km|nmi}}, although Ziguinchor is only {{convert|48|km}} away.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|author=Jean Raymond Thomas|coauthors=Pierre Lefebvre, Michel Tricot|url=http://www.kassoumay.com/joola/Rapport%20Expertise%20France.pdf|title=Naufrage du transbordeur s<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>galais ''Le Joola''.

By the beginning of 2008, the island still did not have a power grid. Public lighting employs [[solar energy]], and the hotels and some of the houses use [[diesel generator]]s. Although wide roads were constructed on the island when urban-scale growth was predicted, there are still no cars to make use of them.

===Agriculture and aquaculture===
====Rice cultivation====
[[Image:Kadiandou.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=0.7|left|alt=A metal blade attached to the base of a wooden rod resting against a tree trunk and various wicker products|The lower part of a ''[[kayendo]]'' ends in a sharp wrought iron blade.]]
In Basse Casamance, the rice cycle structures the lives of the population and plays a central economic and religious role.<ref>{{fr}} Di<U+00E9>dhiou (2004), p. 339.</ref> The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance,<ref>Linares (2007), p. 5.</ref> practice a unique form of rice cultivation.<ref>{{fr}} ''Atlas du S<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>gal'' (2007), p. 121.</ref> Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Exploration|explorers]], show them to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed.<ref>{{fr}} Palmeri (1995), pp. 152.</ref>

The basic tool used is the ''[[kayendo]]'',<ref group=notes>Also spelled ''kajandu'', ''kajendo'', ''kadiendo'', or ''kadiandou''</ref> a kind of wooden spade or shovel ranging from {{convert|40|to|70|cm}}, surrounded by a sharp wrought iron blade and attached to a very long, straight, cylindrical neck. The two parts are connected by strips of torn [[Borassus|Palmyra Palm]] leaves. The main part is manufactured from a very hard wood measuring {{convert|2|to|2.5|m}} in length. The ''kayendo'' is mainly used to plough rice fields, but is also used for other purposes, such as excavation and construction.<ref>{{fr}} Berghen and Manga (1999), pp. 54&ndash;56.</ref><!-- Citation covers previous four sentences --> Men perform the clearing and ploughing while the women take care of the sowing, replanting, and weeding as well as the harvesting between October and January.

An even checkerboard plot model dominates the green landscape during the rainy season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ only in terms of soil type and location.<ref>{{fr}} Berghen and Manga (1999), pp. 56&ndash;75.</ref> Where [[mangrove]]s are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice [[paddy field]]s between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build [[levee]]s, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and [[shrimp]] which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of the rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.
[[Image:Carabane-Digue.jpg|thumb|240px|right|alt=A pond in the foreground with a steep embankment blocking its spreading to the left and with trees in the background|Levees are used to protect the rice paddy fields from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide.]]
Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice cultivation has been threatened since the late 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community.<ref>{{fr}} Foucher (2002), pp. 389&ndash;390.</ref> The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.<ref>{{Cite book|author=A. Endre Nyerges|title=The Ecology of Practice: Studies of Food Crop Production in Sub-Saharan West Africa|publisher=Routledge|date=1997|page=42|isbn=9056995731}}</ref>

[[Millet]] and vegetables are among some of the other crops grown in Carabane. A few domestic farm animals such as pigs are raised, but they are normally left to roam free.

====Palm oil and palm wine====
Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of [[African oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis''), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: [[palm oil]] and [[palm wine]]. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.<ref>{{fr}} Palmeri (1995), pp. 178&ndash;179.</ref><!-- ref cites entire paragraph -->
[[Image:Elaeis guineensis MS 4765.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Two fruit clusters next to a black pot all lying on the ground|[[Elaeis guineensis|Oil palm fruit]] clusters are integral to the local cuisine.]]
[[Image:Mlomp-Mus<U+00E9>eDiola10.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Various equipment hanging from a wall with green rope|Equipment for harvesting palm wine traditionally includes the calabash; however, this natural container has mostly been replaced by synthetic bottles.]]
Palm wine (called ''bunuk'' or ''bounouk'' in the Jola language) is an alcoholic drink derived from the natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of [[Vitis vinifera|grapes]]. The recent partial [[Islamization]] of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated [[calabash]] or, more recently, a bottle. The [[Ethanol|alcohol]] content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to [[Fetishism|fetishes]]. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest the popularity of the drink, such as ''Bunuk abajut birto'', which means "With palm wine, one never stands up," or ''Ulako, kumusaet j<U+00ED>gabulaju'', which means "Sit down, don't spill the palm wine."<ref>{{fr}} Datta (1998), pp. 396&ndash;398.</ref>

====Aquaculture====
The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise [[artisan fishing]], just to supply their own daily needs. [[Pirogue]]s cut from the trunks of [[kapok]] trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from [[Mali]], [[Guinea]], and [[Ghana]],<ref>{{fr}} Cormier-Salem (July&ndash;August 1985), pp. 448&ndash;454.</ref> developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.

The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance,<ref name=Corm08>{{fr}} Cormier-Salem (1989), pp. 91&ndash;107.</ref> which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with [[Petite C<U+00F4>te]] and [[Sine-Saloum]]. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in [[dietary mineral]]s and [[vitamin C]], they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the [[staple food]], and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.ideecasamance.org/erez.htm|title=Exploitation durable des ressources estuariennes de la r<U+00E9>gion de Ziguinchor|publisher=Id<U+00E9>e Casamance|accessdate=June 26, 2008}}</ref> Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by [[Hawker (trade)|hawkers]].<ref name=Corm08/>
[[Image:Carabane-Oysters.JPG|thumb|right|alt=The roots of mangrove trees sticking out of the sand with oysters stuck to their sides|[[Crassostrea gasar|Mangrove oysters]] collect on the roots of mangrove trees.]]
[[Crustacean]]s, such as [[Uca pugilator|sand fiddler crabs]] and shrimp, among the mangroves also occupy a significant place in the local economy. While a large number of shrimp species inhabit the [[Senegambian]] area, a single family exists in Casamance: [[Penaeidae]].<ref name="Da Costa">{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.ideecasamance.org/dacosta.doc|title=''Rapport de stage sur la crevette casaman<U+00E7>aise''|publisher=Id<U+00E9>e Casamance|author=Richard Da Costa|date=2005|accessdate=June 26, 2008}}</ref> [[Farfantepenaeus notialis|Southern pink shrimp]] (''Farfantepenaeus notialis'') are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed the extent to which the shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in [[Ziguinchor]] which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.<ref name="Da Costa"/><!-- ref cites two previous sentences -->

Notably through [[microcredit]], they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and processing shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a [[rural exodus]] of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.<ref>{{fr}} Cormier (1985), pp. 267&ndash;273.</ref><!-- ref cites two previous sentences -->

===Tourism===
[[Image:Carabane-Kitesurf.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A green, white, and yellow kite in the blue sky with a beached boat and several trees in the foreground|[[Kitesurfing]] is a common tourist activity in Carabane.]]
The [[Senegal|Republic of Senegal]] placed an emphasis on [[Tourism in Senegal|tourism]] early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became a priority in the country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (1973&ndash;1977).<ref>{{fr}} Scibilia (2003), p. 17.</ref> Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country. Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain [[Henri Brosselard-Faidherbe|Brosselard-Faidherbe]] as a kind of Brazil in Africa,<ref name="Casamance et Mellacor<U+00E9>e"/> Carabane seemed well-placed to attract visitors in search of [[exoticism]] as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and [[kite surfing]].<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite web|url=http://dakite.ausenegal.com/articles.php?lng=fr&pg=166
|title=Casamance - Karabane|publisher=DaKite (Dakar Kitesurfing)]|accessdate=June 26, 2008}}</ref>

At the same time, national and even international controversy threatened the industry from the beginning. Those who opposed tourism in Senegal described it as a [[Neocolonialism|new form of colonialism]] while supporters saw it as a panacea that would cure the country of [[underdevelopment]].<ref>{{fr}} Schelecten (1988), p. 442.</ref> The idea of alternative tourism was discussed. Several towns in Basse Casamance, including Carabane, were selected to test an integrated [[agritourism]] managed by the villagers themselves. In the early 1970s, the agritourism promoter Christian Saglio, a young French sociologist who later became the director of the [[Leopold Sedar Senghor French Institute]] in [[Dakar]], believed in Carabane's potential. He stated that he wanted to make the island the "[[Gor<U+00E9>e]] of Casamance", using it as a hub for other camps. Saglio suggested the restoration of old buildings and [[canopy bed]]s.<ref>{{fr}} Scibilia (2003), p. 41.</ref>
[[Image:Carabane-H<U+00F4>tel.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A white, two-story building surrounded by trees|The Catholic mission house built in 1880 has since been turned into a hotel.]]
Despite his fervour, Saglio's negotiations with the local people were unsuccessful. [[Niomoune]] and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages.<ref>{{fr}} Scibilia (2003), p. 35.</ref> The project was eventually abandoned, and the [[Catholic missions]] house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.<ref group=notes>The camps were set up in [[Elinkine]], [[Enampore]], [[Ba<U+00EF>la]], [[Thionck Essyl]], [[Coubalan]], [[Affiniam]], [[Ab<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>]], [[Oussouye]] and [[Palmarin]].</ref>

While Carabane's tourism sector has suffered because it has not taken part in the network of villages, tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest. The signing of a [[ceasefire]] in 2004 allowed tourism to resume, but not to the extent it had reached before the conflict.<ref>{{fr}} {{Cite news|url=http://www.marches-tropicaux.com/article.asp?art_id=8614|title=En Casamance, le tourisme a repris, mais peine <U+00E0> d<U+00E9>coller|newspaper=March<U+00E9>s tropicaux et m<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>ens|date=May 23, 2008|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref>

Tour operators continue to advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life,<ref name=teranganovdec2007>{{fr}} Ropitault (November&ndash;December 2007), pp. 16&ndash;25.</ref> but this type of discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the ''cases <U+00E1> [[impluvium]]'' in [[Enampore]] or [[Mlomp]] with a few days of relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in [[Cap Skirring]] or [[Saly]]. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.<ref name=Radio-Canada/><!-- ref cites previous two sentences -->

Although remaining separate from the local tourism network, Carabane has demonstrated its support for [[social solidarity]] and [[holism]] by joining GENSEN (Global Ecovillage Network Senegal), a network of Senegalese [[ecovillage]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gensenegal.org/ecovillages.htm|title=What is an ecovillage?|publisher= GENSEN|accessdate=June 8, 2008}}</ref>
