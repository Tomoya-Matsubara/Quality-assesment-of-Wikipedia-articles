'''''Old Glory''''' ([[1939 in film|1939]]) is a ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[animation|animated]] cartoon directed by [[Chuck Jones]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], and released to theatres by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[Vitaphone|The Vitaphone Corporation]]. It premiered at the famed [[Carthay Circle]] Theater at Los Angeles on July 1, 1939 - three days before [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].

==Plot==
The uniquely serious Schlesinger-produced cartoon retells the origins of the [[United States|United States of America]]. [[Porky Pig]] plays a child forced to learn the [[Pledge of Allegiance]]. He becomes quickly bored and falls asleep. In his dream, [[Uncle Sam]] (voiced by John Deering [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0214385/]) comes to life and teaches Porky about history from [[Colonial America]] through the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|midnight ride]] of [[Paul Revere]] (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and the [[American Revolutionary War]] to the expansion of the [[American Old West]], briefly alluding to [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Upon awakening, Porky snaps into a [[salute]] and recites the pledge as the [[Flag of the United States]] waves overhead and the words "The End" pan over the waving flag. There are no [[Merrie Melodies]] rings at the end, as in other shorts, or the words "That's All, Folks!" (The [[Flag of the United States]] has only 48 stars, as this short was made before [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]] were admitted to the Union. Also, this Pledge of Allegiance as recited by Porky does not yet include the phrase "under [[God]]". That phrase was not added until 1954).

==Analysis==
The animation in ''Old Glory'' is realistic and heavily [[rotoscope]]d, different from the usual Warner Bros. style. Director Chuck Jones was known for his [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-like style during this period, and Schlesinger assigned him to make this cartoon for that reason. The scene with [[Patrick Henry]] (voiced by [[John Litel]]) saying his "[[Give me Liberty, or give me Death!|Give Me Liberty]]" speech was rotoscoped from the Warner Bros. color 2-reel historical short, ''Give Me Liberty''. That short won the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film|Best Short Subject - Color]] of 1936.

The original ending was cut when the cartoon was reissued twice as a Blue Ribbon Merrie Melody once on August 25, 1945 during the 1944-45 season (evident from the style opening rings used: orange rings with a black background) and again on September 12, 1953 during the 1953-54 season (evident from the style opening rings used: orange rings with a blue background). A version with a restored ending can be found on the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2|Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 2]]'', Disc 3. This copy retains the Blue Ribbon opening, but also the original opening shot of the flag and its music cue.

''Old Glory'' is Jones's first short to feature Porky Pig. It is also Porky's first appearance in a color Merrie Melody since his debut in 1935's [[I Haven't Got a Hat]], and his first short in three-strip Technicolor.<ref>Beck, Jerry, editor.

During the late 1960s, ''Old Glory'' was regularly screened between [[rock music|rock]] acts at [[the Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco]]. Many of the Fillmore's patrons drew great amusement from a pig (or [[police officer|"cop"]] in 1960s slang) saluting the American flag.<ref>Beck, p. 124.</ref>
