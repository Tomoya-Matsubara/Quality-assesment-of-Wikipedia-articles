'''V<U+00ED>tor Borba Ferreira''' (born [[April 19]], [[1972]] in [[Recife]], [[Pernambuco]]), commonly known as '''Rivaldo''', is a [[Brazil]]ian professional [[football (soccer)]] player, who plays for [[Greece|Greek]] club [[Olympiacos]] in the [[Super League Greece]]. He most notably played five years with [[Spain|Spanish]] club [[FC Barcelona]], with whom he won the 1998 and 1999 Spanish [[La Liga]] championship and the 1998 [[Copa del Rey]]. He was honoured as [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1999. He was named by [[Pel<U+00E9>]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|125 Greatest Living Footballers]] at a [[FIFA]] Awards Ceremony in [[2004 in football (soccer)|2004]].

Between [[1993]] and [[2003]], Rivaldo played 74 matches and scored 34 goals for the [[Brazil national football team]] (''A Sele<U+00E7><U+00E3>o''), and he was part of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] winning Brazilian team. An [[midfielder (soccer)|attacking midfielder]], he is known for his play-making capabilities, as well as his technique. He is also known for his [[bicycle kick]]s. 

==Biography==
Rivaldo had an extremely poor upbringing in the [[favelas]] of the port town of [[Recife]]. His physical appearance still marks the poverty he experienced in his childhood: malnourishment-caused [[Genu varus|bowleggedness]] and the loss of several teeth. Rivaldo's father Romildo was killed in a road accident in 1989, but Rivaldo went on to his first professional contract later that year.<ref name="overcoming">Mike Lee, [http://www.britishcouncil.org/japan-sport-footballculture-players-rivaldo-greatest.htm Overcoming Tragedy to be the Greatest], ''[[British Council]]''</ref>

===Beginnings in Brazil===
Rivaldo began his professional career at the age of 16, when he signed with Paulista in 1989.<ref name="father">[http://access.fifa.com/en/article/0,4151,17299,00.html Rivaldo: In the name of the father], ''[[FIFA]]'', October 10, 2000</ref> despite the Paulista coaches believing him too physically weak to succeed.<ref name="overcoming"/> He went on to play for [[Santa Cruz Futebol Clube|Santa Cruz FC]] in 1991. In 1992, he moved south to the state of [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] where he played for [[Mogi Mirim EC]] in the second tier of Brazilian football. In 1993, the forward moved to the state capital to play for [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|SC Corinthians]] in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S<U+00E9>rie A|first division]]. In the same year, he debuted for the [[Brazilian national football team]], scoring the only goal in the [[friendly match]] against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. 

In the next year, he switched local allegiances and moved to [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|SE Palmeiras]], helping the club successfully defend its league championship in 1994. In both 1993 and 1994, he was honoured by the authoritative publication [[Placar Magazine]] with the [[Bola de Ouro|Bola de Prata]] for the best player in his field position. He was selected to represent Brazil at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. The Brazilian team won the [[bronze medal]], but Rivaldo was made the [[scape-goat]] for Brazil's semi-final defeat to [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], and was excluded from the Brazilian national team by national team manager [[Mario Zagallo]].<ref name="father"/>

===Transfer to Europe===
After the 1996 Olympics, Rivaldo moved to [[Spain]] as he joined [[Deportivo La Coru<U+00F1>a]] in the [[La Liga|Spanish La Liga championship]]. He only stayed for one season, but nonetheless a very successful one for both him and the club. Rivaldo was the (shared) fourth best goal scorer of the season with 21 goals in 41 matches, as La Coru<U+00F1>a ended third in the league. Rivaldo moved on to league rivals [[FC Barcelona]] in 1997, in a [[transfer deal]] securing La Coru<U+00F1>a a 4.000 million [[Spanish peseta|peseta]] (around $26 million) transfer fee.<ref name="father"/>

In his first season at Barcelona, he was the second best goal scorer with 19 goals in 34 matches, as Barcelona won [[The Double]] of [[La Liga]] championship and [[Copa del Rey]]. Rivaldo returned to the Brazilian national team for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], where he scored three goals, including two in the 3-2 quarter-final win against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. Rivaldo had not been a part of the triumphant Brazilian team at the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 1997|1997 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica tournament]], but he was the absolute star in the successful defence of that title at the [[Copa Am<U+00E9>rica 1999|1999 Copa Am<U+00E9>rica]]. Rivaldo earned himself the distinction as top scorer of the tournament with 5 goals, one being the equaliser from a trademark free-kick in a 2-1 win over Argentina in the quartefinals, and two in the 3-0 victory over [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the final. He was named the [[Most Valuable Player]] of the tournament.

In 1999, he won another La Liga title with Barcelona, and was again the second most scoring player in the league. In 1999, Rivaldo won both the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] and [[European Footballer of the Year]] awards. In his third season in Barcelona, Rivaldo fell out with manager [[Louis van Gaal]], when he insisted to play as a playmaker, and not on the left wing.<ref>[http://www.4thegame.com/wanadoo/news/story/70237/RIVALDO+NOT+A+HAPPY+NOU+CAMP-ER.html RIVALDO NOT A HAPPY NOU CAMP-ER], ''[[4thegame]]'', December 22, 1999</ref> Even though he had a strained relationship with van Gaal, Rivaldo went on to score 10 goals in the European [[UEFA Champions League]] tournament, as the club reached the semi-finals. Van Gaal was fired in [[June 2000]]. In the following [[La Liga season 2000/2001|2000-01 season]], Rivaldo was once again the second best goal scorer of the league. In the last game of the season, against [[Valencia CF]], Rivaldo scored a [[hat-trick]] to win the game 3-2. His third goal was a bicycle kick from the edge of the area in the 90th minute of the game, and is regarded as one of his greatest goals ever in a combination of importance and skill.<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2002/story/0,,746642,00.html A star less bright], ''[[The Observer]]'', [[June 30]], [[2002]]</ref> The win secured Barcelona a place in the following UEFA Champions League tournament.

===2002 World Cup===
Rivaldo had been the centre of criticism when Brazil did not win matches, ever since the 1996 Olympics,<ref>Rodrigo Amaral, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/england_v_brazil/newsid_2056000/2056726.stm Rivaldo reflects on wheel of fortune], ''[[BBC]]'', [[June 20]], 2002</ref> as he was said to be saving his best form for his club team. During the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2002 World Cup qualifying games]], Brazil's poor form saw the team being booed by the Brazilian crowds, and in the 1-0 win against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in [[November 2000]], Rivaldo was booed so heavily that he threatened to retire from playing for his country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1031130.stm Brazil questions Rivaldo's role], ''[[BBC]]'', [[November 19]], [[2000]]</ref> 

He was at the centre of numerous [[tug of war]]s between Barcelona and the Brazilian national team. In one incident in the summer of [[2001]], Rivaldo had to play an exhibition match for Brazil against [[Panama national football team|Panama]], commute to [[Poland]] to play a match for Barcelona, and then return to Brazil for a qualifying match against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], all within ten days. 

The zenith of his national team career came at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosted in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. He scored in the first five games for Brazil. Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo]] had done so for four matches, allowing journalists to question whether there was any rivalry between the two athletes. Rivaldo refused, insisting that all he wanted was to be the world champion. His spectacular goal against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in the second round prompted Belgian coach [[Robert Waseige]] to name Rivaldo as the deciding factor.<ref>John Chapman, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/brazil_v_belgium/newsid_2048000/2048030.stm Wilmots tells of ref's apology], ''[[BBC]]'', June 17, 2002</ref> Brazilian midfielder [[Ronaldinho]] helped Rivaldo score a crucial goal in the 2-1 win over [[England national football team|England]] in the quarterfinals. Brazil eventually met [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the final, and went on to win the tournament with a 2-0 victory in the final.

His early performance at the tournament was marked by his play-acting in the group match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. In the closing stages of the match, with  the ball out of play, Turkish defender [[Hakan <U+00DC>nsal]] kicked a ball towards Rivaldo, who was waiting at the corner flag. The ball struck his thigh, but Rivaldo fell to the ground clutching his face. The referee sent the Turkish player off with a second yellow card. After a video review Rivaldo, was fined 11,670 [[Swiss Francs]] by FIFA, 1,670 of which were for "costs".<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/06/05/1022982720138.html Rivaldo fined half a day's pay for play-acting], ''[[The Age]]'', [[June 6]], 2002</ref>

===Barcelona exit===
In [[June 2002]], Van Gaal returned to manage Barcelona. Rivaldo was released from his contract, and signed a three-year deal with the Italian [[Serie A]] club [[AC Milan]]. With Milan, he won the [[Italian Cup]] and the UEFA Champions League in the [[2003 in football (soccer)|2002-03 season]]. His time in Milan proved a mutually disappointing affair. He left the club after a season of very few starts, partly due to injury problems. He briefly returned to Brazil playing for [[Cruzeiro EC|Cruzeiro]] in [[Belo Horizonte]]. In 2004 he returned to Europe, joining Greek [[Alpha Ethniki]] division club [[Olympiacos]]. 

Rivaldo scored some memorable goals in his [[2004-05 in Greek football|first season]] at Olympiacos, including a fantastic effort in the [[Greek Cup]] final with a well placed lob from a difficult position close to the corner flag. Rivaldo also scored two memorable free kicks during the season, the first in the local derby against the other [[Athens]] giant, [[Panathinaikos]], and the second against [[England|English]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the UEFA Champions League. Olympiacos managed to keep the 1-0 lead against their arch-rivals, but Liverpool fought back to score the 3 goals needed to keep Olympiacos from the Final 16, much to Rivaldo's dismay. In the last game of his first season at Olympiacos, the club needed a victory in order to win the Alpha Ethniki championship, with Panathinaikos just one point behind. Olympiacos went on to beat [[Iraklis]] 0-1 in an away match in [[Thessaloniki]], by yet another Rivaldo goal, and secured the championship. 

Rivaldo continued to score in the [[UEFA Champions League 2005-06|UEFA Champions League the following year]]. He scored a stunning 30 yard strike against [[Rosenborg BK]], and against old foes [[Real Madrid]], although this was not enough, as Olympiacos failed to advance from the preliminary Group Phase. In the domestic competitions, he kept the best for the second half of the season. He scored twice in Olympiacos' come-from-behind victory against Panathinaikos, as well as two in his team's 3-0 triumph against second placed [[AEK Athens]], effectively securing another title for ''Thrylos''. He also put Olympiacos through to the [[Greek Cup]] semi-finals, scoring on free-kicks in both quarter-final games against [[Skoda Xanthi]].

Rivaldo renewed his contract with Olympiacos for a third and final year, and promised to give his best, despite having turned 34. He didn't wait long to turn his words into actions: He led Olympiacos to overturn their half-time deficit against Skoda Xanthi, and scored both goals for the dramatic 2-1 victory in the first game of the season, winning him the [[Super League Greece|Greek SuperLeague's]] first-ever Player of the Week and Goal of the Week awards. In [[July 2006]], Rivaldo announced that the [[2006-07 in Greek football|2006-07 season]] with Olympiacos would be his last in [[Europe]], before returning to Brazil.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/5189506.stm Rivaldo to quit at end of season], ''[[BBC]]'', July 17, 2006</ref>

He has stated that "the [[Fan (person)|fans]] of [[Olympiacos]] are wonderful", and the best in any team he has met<ref> [http://www.ribo.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=110&Itemid=27 Rivaldo interview in flash.gr]. ''http://www.flash.gr'', January 23,2007 </ref>;  notable when considering that he has already played for teams such as [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].
