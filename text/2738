'''Hoodoo''', also known as "conjure" and (inaccurately) as "Voodoo", is a traditional [[African-American]] folk spirituality that developed from a number of [[West Africa]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and European spiritual traditions.

==Roots of Hoodoo==
{{POV-section|date=August 2013}}

Hoodoo has some spiritual principles and practices similar to spiritual folkways in [[Haitian people|Haitian]], [[Cubans|Cuban]], [[Jamaican]] and [[New Orleans]] traditions.  Hoodoo seems to have evolved in the [[Mississippi Delta]] where the concentration of slaves had been dense. Hoodoo then spread throughout the Southeast as well as North along the Mississippi as African Americans left the Delta beginning in the 1930s.

There is strong mainstream American prejudice against Hoodoo, based on the myths that hoodoo is practiced primarily with selfish, hurtful intentions, or that it is related to worship of the Christian devil, Satan{{Citation needed|date = August 2013}}. Hoodoo is sometimes thought of{{By whom|date=August 2013}} as "folk magic" or "superstition".  These terms tend to perpetuate the misperception that Hoodoo is a childlike belief in tricks{{Citation needed|date = August 2013}}. The efficacy of hoodoo as a spiritual influence on outcomes in the physical and social world is comparable to that of mainstream religious rituals.

Spiritual folkways like hoodoo are an ever-evolving process, continuously synthesizing from contact with other cultures, religions and folkways.  What is striking about the hoodoo folk process is the use of biblical figures in its practices and in the lives of its practitioners.<ref>Smith, Theophus H. 1994. Conjuring Culture: Biblical Formations of Black America. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 3.</ref>  In fact, most practitioners of Hoodoo integrate this folkway with their Christian religious faith. Icons of Christian saints are often found on hoodoo shrines or altars.

The word ''hoodoo'' first was documented in American English in 1875 and was classified as a [[noun]] (the practice of hoodoo) or a [[transitive verb]]: "I hoodoo you"... with a [[potion]] that causes healing, a parapsychological power, or some harm.<ref>Hoodoo might also be an adjective. For example, in the [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] song "[[Born on the Bayou]]", the line "I can still hear that old hound dog barking, chasin' down a hoodoo there", refers to a hoodoo doctor, someone who is sought by others as a mentor or a minister.</ref><ref>[http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoodoo  Merriam Webster Online]</ref> In [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE), hoodoo is often used to describe a paranormal consciousness or spiritual hypnosis, a "spell".  But hoodoo may also be used as an [[adjective]] for a practitioner, such as hoodoo man.

Regional [[synonym]]s for hoodoo include ''conjuration'', ''conjure'', ''[[witchcraft]]'', or ''rootwork''.<ref>Hyatt, Harry Middleton. 1970&ndash;1978.  ''Hoodoo--Conjuration--Witchcraft--Rootwork''. 5 vols. Hannibal: Western</ref> Older sources from the 18th and 19th century sometimes use the word [[Obeah]] to describe equivalent folk practices.<ref>http://lucky-temple.com/history-hoodoo-voodoo-wicca-obeah.html</ref>

==The Hoodoo Conceptual System==

Western and Central African slaves brought their traditional spiritual concepts and their cultural practices to North America and the Caribbean. According to Carolyn Morrow Long, "At the time of the slave trade, the traditional nature-centered religions of West and Central Africa were characterized by the concept that human well-being is governed by spiritual balance, by devotion to a supreme creator and a pantheon of lesser deities, by veneration and propitiation of the ancestors, and by the use of charms to embody spiritual power. [...] In traditional West African thought, the goal of all human endeavor was to achieve balance." Several African spiritual traditions recognized a genderless supreme being who created the world, was neither good nor evil, and which did not concern itself with the affairs of mankind. Lesser spirits were invoked to gain aid for humanity's problems.<ref>Long, Carolyn Morrow. "Spiritual Merchants: Religion, Magic and Commerce." University of Tennessee Press. Knoxville: 2001.</ref>

Since the 19th century there has been Christian influence in hoodoo thought,<ref>http://lucky-temple.com/history-hoodoo-voodoo-wicca-obeah.html</ref> usually of an Old Testament strain. This is particularly evident in relation to God's [[Divine Providence|providence]] and his role in [[retributive justice]].  For example, though there are strong ideas of good versus evil, cursing someone to cause their death might not be considered a malignant act.  For example, one practitioner explained it as follows:

::"[In] Hoodooism, anythin' da' chew do is de plan of God undastan', God have somepin to do wit evah' thin' you do if it's good or bad, He's got somepin to do wit it . . . jis what's fo' you, you'll git it."<ref>Hyatt. ''Hoodoo''. vol. II. p. 1761.</ref>
::: '' "([In] Hoodooism, anything that you do is the plan of God, God has something to do with everything that you do whether it's good or bad, he's got something to do with it... You'll get what's coming to you)" ''

Not only is God's providence a factor in hoodoo practice, but hoodoo thought understands God as the archetypal hoodoo doctor.  On this matter [[Zora Neale Hurston|Zora Hurston]] stated, "The way we tell it, hoodoo started way back there before everything.  Six days of magic spells and mighty words and the world with its elements above and below was made."<ref>Hurston. 1935. ''Mules and Men''. pp. 183.</ref> From this perspective, biblical figures are often recast as hoodoo doctors and the Bible becomes a source of conjurational spells and is, itself, used as a protective talisman.<ref>Smith. 1994. ''Conjuring Culture''. p. 6.  See also, Hurston's, ''Mules and Men''.  In the appendix she lists the "paraphernalia of conjure", the last on the list being the Christian Bible.</ref>

===Moses-as-conjurer===

Paralleling ''God-as-conjurer'', hoodoo practitioners often understand the biblical figure Moses in similar terms. Hurston developed this idea in her novel ''Moses: Man of the Mountain'', in which she calls Moses, "the finest hoodoo man in the world."<ref>Hurston. ''Moses: Man of the Mountain''. p. ??.</ref> Obvious parallels between Moses and intentional paranormal influence (such as magic) occur in the biblical accounts of his confrontation with Pharaoh.  Moses conjures, or performs magic  "miracles" such as turning his staff into a snake. However, his greatest feat of conjure was using his powers to help free the Hebrews from slavery.  This emphasis on Moses-as-conjurer led to the introduction of the pseudonymous work the ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'' into the corpus of hoodoo reference literature.<ref>One observer at the time called The Sixth And Seventh Books "the Hoodoo Bible". Yvonne Chireau. Black Magic: Religion and the African American Conjuring Tradition. University of California Press, (2006) ISBN 0-520-24988-7</ref>

===Bible-as-talisman===

In hoodoo, "All hold that the Bible is the great conjure book in the world."<ref>Hurston. ''Mules and Men''. p. 280</ref> It has many functions for the practitioner, not the least of which is a source of spells. This is particularly evident given the importance of the book ''Secrets of the Psalms'' in hoodoo culture.<ref>Selig, Godfrey. ''Secrets of the Psalms''</ref> This book provides instruction for using psalms for things such as safe travel, headache, and marital relations. The Bible, however, is not just a source of spells but is itself a conjuring talisman. It can be taken "to the crossroads," carried for protection, or even left open at specific pages while facing specific directions.  This informant provides an example of both uses:
:"Whenevah ah'm afraid of someone doin' me harm ah read the 37 Psalms an' co'se ah leaves the Bible open with the head of it turned to the east as many as three days."<ref>Hyatt. ''Hoodoo''. vol. 1. p. 417.  Quoted in Smith. ''Conjuring Culture''. p. 14. n. 8.</ref>

==Practices==

The purpose of hoodoo is to allow people access to [[supernatural]] forces to improve their daily lives. Hoodoo helps people attain power or success ("luck") in many areas of life including money, love, [[divination]], [[revenge]], [[health]], employment, and [[necromancy]]. As in many other spiritual and medical folk practices, extensive use is made of [[herb]]s, [[mineral]]s, parts of animals' bodies, an individual's possessions and bodily fluids, especially [[menstrual cycle|menstrual blood]], [[urine]], saliva, and [[semen]].

Contact with ancestors or other spirits of the dead is an important practice within the conjure tradition, and the recitation of [[Psalms]] from the [[Bible]] is also considered spiritually influential in hoodoo. Due to hoodoo's great emphasis on an individual's spiritual power to effect desired change in the course of events, hoodoo's principles are believed to be accessible for use by any individual of faith. Hoodoo practice does not require a formally designated minister.

Home-made potions and charms form the basis of much rural hoodoo, but there are also some successful commercial companies selling various hoodoo products to urban and town practitioners. These are generally called spiritual supplies, and they include herbs, roots, minerals, [[candle]]s, [[incense]], oils, glitter, floor washes, sachet powders, bath crystals, icons, aerosols, and colognes. Many [[patent medicine]]s, [[cosmetics]], and household cleaning supplies for mainstream consumers have been aimed also at hoodoo practitioners.  Some products have dual usage as conventional and spiritual supplies, examples of which include the [[Four Thieves Vinegar]],<ref>{{cite book | last=Felix | first=Talia | title=The Conjure Cookbook | publisher=Createspace | page=32 | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4505-7317-7 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=scO-v-0bP6gC&lpg=PA31}}</ref> [[Florida Water]],<ref>{{cite book | last=Felix | first=Talia | title=Voodoo Conjure | publisher=Createspace | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4505-8227-8}}</ref> and Red Devil Lye.<ref>http://www.luckymojo.com/devil.html</ref>

==Cultural influences==

Traditionally, religions and spiritual folkways around the world have freely borrowed practices and beliefs from each other.  In this regard, hoodoo is no different. Thus, it is difficult to establish the regional/cultural origins of many practices. For example, the use of an effigy, often called a "voodoo doll" in popular culture, to perform a spell on someone is documented in African, Native American, and European cultures.<ref>For an English example, see Scot, Reginald. 1584. ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft''. 1972 edition. New York: Dover Publications.  p. 47. ISBN 0-486-26030-5</ref><ref>Cherokee anthropologist, Alan Kilpatrick, provides a related example of this idea in ''The Night Has a Naked Soul: Witchcraft and Sorcery Among the Western Cherokee''.  Syracuse: Syracuse University Press. pp. 92-93. ISBN 0-8156-0471-8. Kilpatrick explains a practice the origin of which is not traced; a Cherokee conjuror takes the saliva of an intended victim and places it in the earth "where the worms live." Thus, the person's saliva is a symbolic stand-in for the intended victim.</ref>

===Europe===

Europe's greatest identifiable influence on hoodoo is the presence and use of European or European-American [[grimoire]]s. One of the first examples of this is [[John George Hohman]]'s ''Pow-wows: or, Long Lost Friend'', a collection of magical spells originally published in 1820 for [[Pennsylvania Dutch|Pennsylvania-Dutch]] Hexemeisters.<ref>Hohman, John George. 1820. ''Pow-wow's: or, Long Lost Friend.'' 1971 reprint edition. Pomeroy: Health Research Books.</ref> Pow-wows was introduced to hoodoo through catalogs on magic geared toward the African-American community in the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The spells in this book are woven throughout with Christian symbolism and prayer, which made it a natural addition to the similar symbolism of hoodoo. Mirroring the hoodoo concept of the ''Bible-as-talisman'', the book itself proposes to be a protective [[amulet]]: "Whoever carries this book with him is safe from all his enemies, visible or invisible; and whoever has this book with him cannot die without the holy corpse of Jesus Christ, nor drown in any water, nor burn up in any fire, nor can any unjust sentence be passed upon him. So help me."<ref>Hohman. 1820. ''Pow-Wow''. pp. 63 and 84.</ref>

The ''[[Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses]]'' is a European grimoire that is purportedly based on Jewish [[Kabbalah]], though it actually covers little, if any,  Kabbalistic thought. It contains numerous signs, seals, and passages in Hebrew that are supposed to be related to Moses' ability to work wonders. Though its authorship is attributed to Moses, the oldest manuscript dates to the mid-19th century. Its importance in hoodoo practice is summarized as follows:

:"I read de "Seven Books of Moses" seven or eight yeah a'ready&nbsp;... de foundation of hoodooism came from way back yondah de time dat Moses written de book "De Seven Book of Moses."<ref>Hyatt. ''Hoodoo''. vol. I. pp. 1758<U+2013>1759.</ref>

==Differences between Voodoo and Hoodoo==

Like Voodoo, Hoodoo shows evident links to the practices and beliefs of West African spiritual folkways.  The ancient African folkway of Vodun is a more standardized and widely dispersed spiritual practice than hoodoo. Vodun's modern form is practiced across West Africa in the countries now known as [[Benin]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]], among others. In [[Haiti]], [[Cuba]], and other [[Caribbean|Caribbean islands]], the worship of the Vodoun gods (called [[Loa|''lwa'' or ''loas'']]) is practiced in a [[syncretism|syncretic]] form that has been greatly modified by contact with [[Catholicism]].  The [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] of Haiti and [[Louisiana Voodoo]] are related more to Vodun than to Hoodoo; similar Vodun practices among Spanish speakers in Cuba are called [[Santer<U+00ED>a]].

However, a more precise description of what Voodoo is and how it relates to both Vodun and to Hoodoo is needed.

==Hoodoo in Popular Culture==

===Music===

Many blues musicians have referred to hoodoo in their songs. Popular examples include "Louisiana Hoodoo Blues" by [[Ma Rainey]], "Hoodoo Lady Blues" by [[Arthur Crudup]], and "Hoodoo Man Blues" by [[Junior Wells]]. In addition to the expected terms "hoodoo" and "voodoo",  other conjure words in blues songs include "[[jinx]]", "[[goofer dust]]", "nation sack", "[[black cat bone]]", "John de conkeroo" ([[John the Conqueror root]]), "graveyard dirt", "[[hot foot powder]]", "black spider dumplings,  "mojo" and "mojo hand"."

The [[Bo Diddley]] song "[[Who Do You Love]]" contains an extensive series of puns about a man hoodooing his lover. He also recorded an album titled ''Got My Own Bag of Tricks'' (1972), a reference to a [[Mojo (African American culture)|mojo hand]] or trick bag. In [[Chuck Berry]]'s song "Thirty Days" he threatens an ex-lover, telling her that he "...talked to the gypsy woman on the telephone [...] she gonna send out a world wide hoodoo...". [[Woody Guthrie]] wrote the lyrics for "Hoodoo Voodoo", a song later performed by Wilco and Billy Bragg. The song "[[Born on the Bayou]]" by [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] has the line "Chasing down a hoodoo there...". [[Ike & Tina Turner]]'s 1963 album ''It's Gonna Work out Fine'' featured a song titled "Mojo Queen", with definite references to [[Mojo (African American culture)|mojo]], the magic charms used by hoodoo practitioners, or a state of ecstatic, intuitive, flawless performance.  The [[Clutch]] song "Hoodoo Operator," from the album ''[[Slow Hole To China]],'' speaks of a hoodoo practitioner.  The Kenny Rogers song "The Hoodooin' of Miss Fannie DeBerry" (from ''[[The Gambler (album)|The Gambler]]'') is about a young girl who claims to be possessed by the Devil.
