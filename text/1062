'''Greaves Motorsport''', previously known as '''Team Bruichladdich''', are a British [[auto racing|racing team]], currently competing in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] and the [[European Le Mans Series]] as of 2013.

In 2006, Greaves Motorsport, run by [[Tim Greaves]], entered the [[Le Mans Series]] (LMS) for the first time, running a [[Radical SR9]] team in conjunction with [[Radical Sportscars|Radical]], and competing under the ''[[Bruichladdich]] Radical'' banner. After four years of running Radicals in both the LMS and the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the team, now known as ''Team Bruichladdich'', purchased a [[Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2]] and ran it in place of the SR9. In 2011, the team became known as ''Greaves Motorsport'', and they switched to the new [[Zytek Z11SN]], winning the [[LMP2]] category of both the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] and the Le Mans Series. For 2012, they entered the new European Le Mans Series (ELMS) and FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC), finishing third in the LMP2 category of the ELMS, and fifth in the WEC.
