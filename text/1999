'''Benjamin Nicolas Marie Appert''' (September 10, 1797 <U+2013> 1847) was a [[France|French]] [[philanthropist]], not to be confused with [[Nicolas Appert]].
 
He was born in [[Paris]]. While a young man he introduced a system of mutual instruction into the regimental schools of the ''[[D<U+00E9>partements of France|d<U+00E9>partement]]'' of the [[Nord (d<U+00E9>partement)|Nord]]. The success which it obtained induced him to publish a ''Manual'' setting forth his system. While engaged in teaching prisoners at [[Montaigu]]{{disambiguation needed|date=February 2013}}, he fell under the suspicion of having connived at the escape of two of them, and was thrown into the [[La Force Prison|prison of La Force]].

On his release he resolved to devote the rest of his life to bettering the condition of those whose lot he had for a time shared, and he travelled much over Europe for the purpose of studying the various systems of prison discipline, and wrote several books on the subject. After the [[July Revolution|revolution of 1830]] he became secretary to [[Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies|Queen Marie Am<U+00E9>lie Therese]], and organized the measures taken for the relief of the needy. He was decorated with the [[L<U+00E9>gion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]] in 1833.
