'''Alan Carr''' (born 14 June 1976) is an English comedian and television personality. He was born in [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] in [[Dorset]] yet spent his childhood in [[Northampton]] before moving to [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Manchester]] in his early 20s where he began his comedy career. Carr's breakthrough was in 2001, winning the [[City Life (magazine)|City Life]] Best Newcomer of the Year and the [[BBC New Comedy Awards|BBC New Comedy Award]].

In the ensuing years, his career burgeoned on the Manchester comedy circuit before becoming well known for hosting ''[[The Sunday Night Project|The Friday Night Project]]'' with [[Justin Lee Collins]]. This led to the release of a short-lived entertainment show ''[[Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong]]'' in 2008, and eventually, his popular comedy chat show ''[[Alan Carr: Chatty Man]]'', which has been airing since 2009. Carr also hosted a radio show, ''[[Going Out with Alan Carr]]'', on [[BBC Radio 2]] for three years as well as going on two arena tours: ''Tooth Fairy Live'' (2007) and ''Spexy Beast Live'' (2011).

After completing his degree in his early 20s, Carr moved to [[Manchester]] seeking a better life and with aspirations of becoming a comedian. He moved into a house full of activity in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] after which he moved to [[Stretford]]; which he cites as an inspiration for his comedic work.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Life's no joke for camp Carr |url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/news_and_reviews/news/7404_life_s_no_joke_for_camp_carr |work=citylife.co.uk |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}</ref> Carr soon became a regular on the Manchester comedy circuit, including ''Alan Carr's Ice Cream Sunday'' at the Manchester Comedy Store.

Despite being [[coming out|openly]] gay, he does not consider his sexuality to be a focal part of his act, once saying, "I just think gay people need to get over themselves. Just because you're gay and on the telly doesn't mean you're a role model. I'm just a comedian. That's all I am. What am I meant to do? Do I go down the [[Julian Clary]] route and talk about [[fisting]] and [[poppers]]? I don't talk about being gay and I think what better equality for gays than that?"<ref name="G int">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/apr/13/comedy.television

==Controversy==
In December 2008, when accepting his award for Best Entertainment Personality at the [[British Comedy Awards]], Carr dedicated it to [[Kidnapping of Shannon Matthews|Karen Matthews]], who had earlier that month been found guilty of kidnapping [[Kidnapping of Shannon Matthews|Shannon Matthews]], her own daughter. Carr was quoted by [[BBC News]] as stating: "I should dedicate this award to her [Karen]. She would be my dream guest. I think she's a [[gay icon]]. People like a bit of rough, don't they?"<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a137777/carr-sorry-over-comedy-award-dedication.html Carr sorry over comedy award dedication] ''[[Digital Spy]]''. 8 December 2008.

[[Shahid Malik]], [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Matthews' constituency of [[Dewsbury]] described Carr's comments about Shannon Matthews as "sick and insensitive".

Last night at the Comedy Awards [...] I was being ironic, these aren't my real sentiments obviously."<ref>[http://www.alancarr.net/diary/2008/12/apologies-all-round.html Apologies All Round]. 8 December 2008.
