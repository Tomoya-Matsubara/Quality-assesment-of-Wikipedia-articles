'''Cindy Blackman''' (born November 18, 1959 in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]) is an American [[jazz]] and [[Rock (music)|rock]] [[drummer]]. Blackman is best-known for recording and touring with [[Lenny Kravitz]]. Blackman has recorded several straight-ahead jazz albums under her own name, and has performed with acclaimed jazz and rock artists, including [[Pharoah Sanders]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Sam Rivers]], [[Cassandra Wilson]], [[Angela Bofill]], [[Buckethead]], [[Bill Laswell]] and [[Joe Henderson]]. [[Tony Williams]] is her main drumming influence. In 1997 she recorded ''[[Multiplicity]]'' as a drum teaching video. "To me, jazz is the highest form of music that you can play because of the creative requirements," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLWindsor>[http://www.canada.com/windsorstar/news/entertainment/story.html?id=49b4d205-2f9e-4d65-9656-933f3bc7fe38&k=28756 the Windsor Star.

==Musical career==
===Early training and influences===
Born November 18, 1959, Blackman comes from a musical family, both her mother and grandmother were [[classical music]]ians and her uncle a vibist.<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide /> "My mom, when she was younger, played [[violin]] in classical [[orchestra]]s, and her mom, incidentally, was a classical musician. My mom used to take me to see classical concerts," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLBoston>[http://weeklywire.com/ww/02-21-00/boston_music_4.html The Boston Phoenix.  "Limbering Up: Cindy Blackman's rock and jazz" by Jon Garelick.  February 21, 2000.]</ref> "My dad was into jazz -- [[Miles Davis]], [[Ahmad Jamal]], people like that."<ref name=PCOLBoston /> Blackman's first introduction to the drums happened when she was seven years old in her hometown of [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]<ref name=PCOLMusicianguide>[http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000326/Cindy-Blackman.html Musician Guide.  "Cindy Blackman Biography"]</ref> and attending a pool party at a friend's house,<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/>  she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "It was incredible," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "Just looking at them struck something in my core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "And then, when I hit them, it was like, wow, that<U+2019>s me. That<U+2019>s completely natural for me. It<U+2019>s like breathing for me. It didn<U+2019>t feel awkward at all."<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings>[http://www.postindependent.com/article/20080716/VALLEYNEWS/846678379/1076 Glenwood Springs Post Independent.  "Glenwood Springs' Summer of Jazz features drummer Cindy Blackman" by Stina Sieg.  July 16, 2008.]</ref>

After her first introduction to drums at her friend's house, Blackman began playing in the [[school band]] and was able to convince her parents to get her a drum set of her own while she was still only seven.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/><ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> "Of course those would be broken up in a matter of days," Blackman says.<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> "The only thing I heard at home was, 'we don't know if you can play drums because one, they're noisy, and two, they're very expensive."<ref name=PCOLDrumhead>[http://www.drumheadftp.com/web/feature.php?id=6 Drumhead.  "Jazz Backhand (An Interview with Cindy Blackman) by Andrew Vargas.]</ref> Some people ask why she didn't study violin or [[flute]] like other girls.<ref name=PCOLWindsor/> "I learned very early on -- when I was 13 -- that when I concentrate on those attitudes, I don't make progress for myself," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLWindsor/> "If they're not paying my mortgage, I don't care what they think."<ref name=PCOLWindsor/>

== Influences ==
When Blackman was 11, she moved to [[Bristol, Connecticut]]<ref name=PCOLBoston /> and studied at the Hart College of Music in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref name=PCOLBoston /> Blackman began to have an interest in jazz at age 13 after listening to [[Max Roach]] and got her first professional [[drum kit]]set at 14.<ref name=PCOLNj>[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2007/08/dedicated_to_her_drums.html New Jersey. "Dedicated to her drums" by Zan Stewart.  September 1, 2007.]</ref><ref name=PCOLBoston /> "Jazz was the thing that was most intriguing because of the challenge that was involved," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLBoston /> "When I was shown that the drummers on these records were playing independently with all four limbs, I was like: 'Really?! Is that what they're doing? Is that what Max Roach is doing on that record? Oh! Okay!'"

Drummer [[Tony Williams]] was an early influence.<ref name=PCOLAlbum>''Code Red''.  Liner Notes.  1992.</ref> "The first drummer I ever saw, where I got to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams," Blackman said.<ref name=PCOLAlbum /> "When I was 16, Tony came to my local drum store with a [[bassist]] and did a [drum] clinic that left a powerful impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should have a lot of impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band--the drums should speak just as freely as anybody."<ref name=PCOLAlbum /> Blackman says that the way the Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "I just love and loved everything about Tony," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music."<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that <U+2013> Okay, I might not be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way."<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/>

Blackman moved to Boston to study at the [[Berklee College of Music]] with [[Alan Dawson]], one of Tony Williams' teachers.<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide>[http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Cindy%20Blackman:1927007363:page=biography? Allmusic.  Cindy Blackman: Biography" by Ron Wynn.]</ref><ref name=PCOLBoston /> "Alan's method was incredible in terms of getting your independence together, getting your hands together," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLBoston />

==Arrival in New York==
[[Image:Cindy Blackman2.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Cindy Blackman playing at the Iridium on December 9, 2007.]]

While she was at Berklee a friend recommended her for a [[gig]] with [[The Drifters]]<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> so Blackman left college after three semesters and moved to [[New York City]] in 1982.<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide /> Blackman worked [[busking]], as a New York street performer<ref name=PCOLVillage>[http://www.thevillager.com/villager_121/cindyblackman.html The Village Voice. "Cindy Blackman plays for Bird" by Rick Mark.  August 24, 2005.]</ref>  but also got a chance to watch and learn.<ref name=PCOLDrumhead />  "I looked for [[Art Blakey]], I looked for Elvin [Jones], I looked for [[Philly Joe Jones]], for [[Roy Haynes]], for [[Tony Williams]]. I saw so many great drummers, like [[Ed Blackwell]] and [[Billy Higgins]], [[Louis Hayes]]. I saw [[Al Foster]] play quite a bit, [[Billy Hart]], [[Jack DeJohnette]]. All these people, they<U+2019>re in New York so I got a chance to watch them do their thing."<ref name=PCOLDrumhead />

While in New York, Art Blakey became a significant influence.<ref name=PCOLJazzhouse>[http://www.jazzhouse.org/library/index.php3?read=nargis4 Jazz House.  "New York Drummer Cindy Blackman" interviewed by Natasha Nargis.  2001.]</ref> "He really was like a father to me. I learned a lot just watching him. I asked him a lot of questions about the drums and music -- and he answered all of them. He was fantastic," said Blackman.<ref name=PCOLJazzhouse /> Blackman initially encountered resistance to a woman playing drums in the jazz world.<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> "I<U+2019>m a [[African American|black]] woman, so I<U+2019>ve encountered [[racial prejudice]], and I<U+2019>ve encountered [[Prejudice|gender prejudice]]. I<U+2019>ve also encountered prejudice against my afro when I wore that out. But I<U+2019>ve also encountered prejudice against my musical opinions. What I<U+2019>ve learned to do is completely ignore that."<ref name=PCOLDrumhead />

===First Compositions and Recording Contracts===
In 1984, Blackman was showcased on [[Ted Curson]]'s "Jazz Stars of the Future" on [[WKCR-FM]] in New York.<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide /> In 1987, Blackman's first compositions appeared on [[Wallace Roney]]'s ''[[Verses]]'' album.<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide />  When an executive at [[Muse Records]] heard Blackman's recordings, he offered her a [[recording contract]] to lead her own project.<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide /> In 1988 Blackman released ''[[Arcane]]'', her debut as a [[bandleader]].<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide /> Her band included Wallace Roney on [[trumpet]], [[Kenny Garrett]] on [[alto saxophone]], [[Joe Henderson]] on [[tenor saxophone]], [[Buster Williams]] and [[Clarence Seay]] on [[Upright bass|bass]], and [[Larry Willis]] on [[piano]].<ref name=PCOLAllmusicguide />

==Work with Lenny Kravitz==
[[Image:Cindy Blackman4.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Blackman with Kravitz in concert in Chile on March 9, 2005. Photo Credit: Ita Barrales, Hugh Pickens]]
In 1993, Blackman had an opportunity to work with [[Lenny Kravitz]].<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> Blackman in New York talked to Kravitz in Los Angeles on the phone, played drums for him over the phone, and Kravitz asked Blackman to fly out to LA.<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> "Lenny asked me can you play something for me over the phone," Blackman says.<ref name=PCOLWindsor/> "So I put the phone down and I started playing something like, BOOSH-bat-bat, BOOSH-BOOSH-BOOSH-bat, and I went back to the phone and I said, 'Can you hear that?' He said, 'Yeah. Can you fly out to L.A. right now?'"<ref name=PCOLWindsor/> "I flew out the next morning. While I<U+2019>m downstairs waiting for the instruments to come from the studio, these people started coming in. First 12, and then like 30 more. I was like, 'whoa, this is an [[audition]]'. I ended up playing and instead of staying for one or two days, I stayed for two weeks and did the first [[video]] that I did with him, ''[[Are You Gonna Go My Way]]''. Apart from 2004, I played with him ever since."<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> 

Blackman had previously only played jazz shows and was unprepared to play for an entire arena.<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> "The first time I played in a really large concert with Lenny was at an outdoor festival called [[Pinkpop]]. We played for like 70,000 people. It was in the summer so most people had just t-shirts or tanks, a lot of guys had their shirts off, so you just see skin and hands and they<U+2019>re doing this wave thing. I almost lost it, my equilibrium was teetering. I wasn<U+2019>t used to seeing that many people; I was disoriented; I just had to stop looking and start focusing."<ref name=PCOLDrumhead /> 

Blackman says that playing with Kravitz and playing jazz are different.<ref name=PCOLVillage /> "My job with Lenny is a different thing. My job is to play a beat for hours, and make it feel good, and add some exciting fills and exciting colors, when it fits tastefully," Blackman says.<ref name=PCOLVillage /> "My job in my band or in a creative situation is a totally different thing. We may start with a groove that feels great, I may play that for hours too, but I<U+2019>m going to explore and expand and change that, play around with the rhythm and interject with the soloists."<ref name=PCOLVillage /> "I like dance music and I like making the music feel good," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "To drive an audience of 100,000 into complete oblivion by playing a groove so strong ... I love doing that. I love the chance to show versatility."<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/>

In an article published May 1, 2004, [[National Public Radio|NPR]]  reported that Blackman had recently left Kravitz's group to focus on her own music.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1866563 National Public Radio.  "Musicians in Their Own Words: Cindy Blackman."  May 1, 2004]</ref> "I love danceable music, and I love big fat beats and I really dig rock 'n' roll," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLWindsor/> "But jazz is my heart, it's my love, and I've never left jazz in mind or spirit."<ref name=PCOLWindsor/>

==Return to Jazz==

In 1994 Blackman made her first recording with a working group and called the album ''[[Telepathy]]'' because of the tight communication in the band.<ref name=PCOLTelepathy /> "I wanted to do a [[quartet]] record because of the amount of space you get with fewer players," she said in Telepathy's [[liner notes]].<ref name=PCOLTelepathy /> "It's intimate, but more dimensional than a piano trio. I'm really into this sound, and it was nice to play with a group that was a group. You can't help but have a better feel when the musicians know each other, are headed in the same direction, and have the same goals. You can make most everything work. You get chances to play a lot of colors, and really stretch your ideas."<ref name=PCOLTelepathy> ''Telepathy.'' Liner Notes.  1994.</ref>

In 2005 Blackman released ''Music for the New Millennium'' on her Sacred Sounds Label.<ref name=PCOLVillage />  "It<U+2019>s rooted in tradition, but it<U+2019>s not traditional music. It<U+2019>s explorative, very creative, very expressive, and we really try to expand any ideas we have that everything is played over the forms, but we like to stretch it, and really see the colors and make the music grow and move," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLVillage /> "We experiment <U+2014> but it<U+2019>s never free. Everything is written out. I have charts for all the songs. We expand on what<U+2019>s there, and stretch [[harmonics]] and note choices."<ref name=PCOLVillage />

Blackman continues to make her home in Brooklyn in New York City.<ref name=PCOLVillage /> "It<U+2019>s always such an amazing place, with every level of musical accomplishment, you can see complete beginners and you can see innovators. That<U+2019>s why I live in New York. Not only is it tough, but all the greatest people have come through New York," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLVillage /> Blackman prefers to play jazz in small, intimiate clubs.<ref name=PCOLCongohead />  "It's an acoustic situation. You are close-knit and you are creating one hundred percent of the time -- so to me it just doesn't really get any better that!"<ref name=PCOLCongohead>[http://www.congahead.com/Musicians/Meet_Musicians/Blackman/blackman.html Congohead.  "Cindy Blackman."]</ref> Blackman also travels extensively conducting drum clinics.<ref name=PCOLZildjian /> In September 2007, she made a tour of [[South America]], teaching clinics in [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Brazil]],<ref name=PCOLZildjian>[http://www.zildjian.com/EN-US/news/newsDetail.ad2?newsID=1571 Zildjian. "Report for the Road - Cindy Blackman South America Clinic Tour."  September 25, 2007]</ref> and on November 30, 2007, Blackman and her quartet performed at Art After 5 at the [[Philadelphia Art Museum]].

==Musical Goals and Personal life==
[[Image:Cindy Blackman3.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Blackman playing at Willisau Jazz on September 2, 2007 in Switzerland]]
Blackman says her goal is to become a musical [[virtuoso]].<ref name=PCOLRochester/> "I want to become a virtuoso," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLRochester/> "To me, virtuosity is the ability to say anything on your instrument you want to at any given moment."<ref name=PCOLRochester/> Blackman describes her music as "completely creative."<ref name=PCOLRochester/> "I want to push the envelope. I want to really expound on some concepts that, to me, are the highest in the improvisation of music," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLRochester/> Blackman loves jazz and wants to delve into its intricacies.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "Oh my gosh, it<U+2019>s the best thing in the world," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/> "I feel so blessed, and I<U+2019>m so thankful to be able to play music. It<U+2019>s an honor, and it<U+2019>s a blessing."<ref name=PCOLGlenwoodsprings/>

===Spirituality of Music===
Blackman attended a [[Baptist]] church during her teenage years, but became a follower of the [[Bah<U+00E1>'<U+00ED> Faith]] at the age of 18; she also started studying [[Kabbalah]] in the 2000s.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar>{{cite web | title = Cindy Blackman's got the beat | publisher = Toronto Star |  date = 2008-06-07 | accessdate = 2008-06-07 | first = Ashante | last = Infantry | url = http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Music/article/438047}}</ref> Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or not, because you have a focused intent," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "You [[transcend]], because you're crossing barriers that a lot of people and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then you can do something good with it. I don't keep that in mind 100 per cent of the time <U+2013> I'm human <U+2013> but I try to."<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/>

===Physical Demands of Playing===
Blackman keeps herself in shape for the physical demands of playing the drums by practicing [[yoga]] and [[karate]].<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "I'm really conscious of taking great care of myself," Blackman says.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "I make sure my body is in peak condition as much as possible. When I'm at home, I eat completely [[Organic food|organic]], take a lot of sea minerals, try to eat [[natural foods]]. I eat nothing out of a can, I don't drink soda and I usually juice my own juices. When I see my peers we talk about different things and I know it pays off."<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/>

===Role as Female Musician===
[[Image:Cindy Blackman5.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Cindy Blackman at Sesc Pomp<U+00E9>ia on August 1, 2007. Original Photo: Ciro Boro]] 
Blackman is a rarity as a female jazz percussionist.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "In the past, there were a lot of [[social stigma|stigma]]s attached to women playing certain instruments," Blackman says.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "I think a lot of women stick to particular instruments, like piano, that are acceptable, so that lessens the playing field in terms of how many women are out there. And let's face it, boys' clubs still exist. But I care nothing about that at all. I'm going to do what I'm going to do musically anyway."<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> However Blackman draws on the role models of her mother who played violin in an orchestra and her grandmother who was a [[classical pianist]] and does not let [[stereotypes]] deter her.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "God forbid I should be limited to only play my drums in my basement; but if that's all I had, that's what I would do," says Blackman.<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/> "Any woman, or anyone facing race prejudice, weight prejudice, hair prejudice ... if you let somebody stop you because of their opinions, then the only thing you're doing is hurting yourself. I don't want to give somebody that power over me."<ref name=PCOLTorontostar/>

Blackman is adamant that musicality has nothing to do with [[gender]].<ref name=PCOLTutu/> "The gender question is not even worth bringing up because the drums have got nothing to do with gender," Blackman says.<ref name=PCOLTutu/> "I'm there because I love to play music. And I'm in support of anyone who wants to play the instrument. I wouldn't care if Art Blakey was pink with polka dots and wearing a tutu. I wouldn't care if Tony Williams was green."<ref name=PCOLTutu>[http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2008/09/06/festival_snares_compelling_drummers/ Boston Globe. "Festival snares compelling drummers" by Siddhartha Mitter.  September 7, 2008.]</ref> "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion," says Blackman. "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else is for you to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't."<ref name=PCOLRochester>[http://www.democratandchronicle.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080606/LIVING/806080302/1032 Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
