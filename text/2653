'''[[Prehistory]]''' comprises all events which took place before the creation of written records. This page lists events from the evolution of the [[universe]] and the [[Earth]] to the [[origin of life]] and [[human evolution]], up to the [[invention of writing]] in approximately 4,000 BC. Note that many of these dates are speculative or very rough estimates. For a timeline of historical events see: '''[[Timeline of world history]]'''. For greater detail see the articles on the various geological periods.
