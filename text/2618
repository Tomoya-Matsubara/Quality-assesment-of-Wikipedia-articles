The '''Mongolian language''' ({{lang|mn| [[Image:Monggol kele.svg|17px]]}}, ''Mong<U+03B3>ol kele''; [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]]: <U+041C><U+043E><U+043D><U+0433><U+043E><U+043B> <U+0445><U+044D><U+043B>, ''Mongol khel'') is the best-known member of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language family]]. It is the [[language]] of most residents of [[Mongolia]] and of many of the [[Mongols|Mongolian]] residents of the [[Inner Mongolia]] [[autonomous region of China]], totalling about 5.7 million speakers. In Mongolia, the [[Khalkha dialect]] of Mongolian, written in Cyrillic, is predominant; in Inner Mongolia, the language is more [[dialect|dialectically]] diverse and written in the traditional [[Mongolian script]].

Mongolian has [[vowel harmony]] and a complex syllabic structure for a Mongolic language that allows up to three syllable-final consonants. It is a typical [[Agglutination|agglutinative language]] that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While the basic word order is [[Subject Object Verb|subject<U+2013>object<U+2013>predicate]], the noun phrase order is relatively free, so functional roles are indicated by a system of about eight [[grammatical case]]s. Verbs can take several [[Grammatical voice|voice]] suffixes and are marked for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] and some other notions belonging to the domains of [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Linguistic modality|modality]] and [[evidentiality]]. In sentence linking, [[converb]]s play a special part.

Mongolian evolved from [[Middle Mongolian]], the language spoken in the [[Mongol Empire]] of the 13th and 14th centuries. In the transition, a major shift in the vowel harmony paradigm occurred, [[Vowel length|long vowels]] developed, the case system was slightly reformed and the verbal system was restructured.

== Classification ==
[[Image:Mongols-map.png|thumb|right|350px|Geographic distribution of the Mongolic languages]]
Mongolian is a [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]]. Other languages in the Mongolic family include Khamnigan and [[Daur language|Dagur]], spoken in Eastern [[Greater Mongolia]] and in the vinicity of [[Tacheng]] in [[Xinjiang]]; [[Eastern Yugur language|Shira Yugur]], [[Bonan language|Bonan]], [[Dongxiang language|Dongxiang]], [[Monguor language|Monguor]], and [[Kangjia language|Kangjia]], spoken in China's [[Qinghai]] and [[Gansu]] regions; and the probably extinct [[Moghol language|Moghol]] of Afghanistan. [[Oirat language|Oirat]] (including the [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk dialect]]) and [[Buryat language|Buryat]] <U+2013> both spoken in Russia, Mongolia and China <U+2013> are considered by some scholars to be major dialects of Mongolian, and by others as Mongolic languages in their own right. [[Ordos dialect|Ordos]], spoken around Inner Mongolia's [[Ordos City]], is regarded by most scholars as a dialect of Mongolian; a few consider it an independent language.<ref>See Janhunen (ed.) 2003 and Sechenbaatar et al. 2005 for two classificatory schemes.</ref> The Altaic theory proposes that the Mongolic family is a member of a larger [[Altaic languages|Altaic family]] that would also include the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Japonic languages]] and [[Korean language|Korean]].

== Geographic distribution and dialects ==

Mongolian is the national language of the state of [[Mongolia]], where it is spoken by about 2.5 million people, and an official language of China's [[Inner Mongolia]] region, where it is spoken by 2.7 million or more people.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 141, 143. On the other hand, Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 206 (an Inner Mongolian source) assume 4 million Inner Mongolians to be proficient in Mongolian.</ref> The exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is hard to determine, as there is no data available on Chinese citizens' language proficiency. There are roughly 5 million people of Mongolian nationality in China, but the use of Mongolian is declining, especially among younger speakers in urban areas due to the dominance of [[Mandarin Chinese]].<ref>Janhunen 2003d: 178.</ref> The great majority of speakers of Mongolian proper in China live in Inner Mongolia, but there are also some speakers of the [[Kharchin dialect|Kharchin]] and [[Khorchin dialect]]s in areas of [[Liaoning]], [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] that border Inner Mongolia.<ref>Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 565.</ref>

The delimitation of the Mongolian language is a much-disputed problem, whose resolution would probably require a set of comparable linguistic criteria for all major [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]]. Such data might account for the [[historical linguistics|historical]] development of the Mongolian [[dialect continuum]], as well as its [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] qualities. Though phonological and lexical studies are comparatively well developed,<ref>See especially Rin<U+010D>jen 1979, Amar<U+017E>argal 1988, Coloo 1988 and for a general bibliography on Mongolic phonology Svantesson et al. 2005: 218<U+2013>229.</ref> the basis for a comparative [[morphology (linguistics)|morpho]]-[[syntax|syntactic]] study, for example between such highly diverse varieties as [[Khalkha dialect|Khalkha]] and Khorchin,<ref>See Ashimura 2002 for a rare piece of research into dialect morpho-syntax that shows significant differences between Khalkha and Khorchin.</ref> is not yet established.<ref>Janhunen 2003d: 189.</ref>

[[File:Byambyn Rinchen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Byambyn Rinchen]] (1905<U+2013>1977), famous Mongolian [[linguist]] and [[translator]]<ref>Bajansan and Odont<U+00F6>r 1995: 132<U+2013>135.</ref>]]
There is no disagreement that the Khalkha dialect of the Mongolian state is Mongolian.<ref>For an exact delimitation of Khalkha, see Amar<U+017E>argal 1988: 24<U+2013>25.</ref> After fixing this one point, however, classification problems arise. For example, the influential classification of San<U+017E>eev (1953) proposed that [[Buryat language|Buryat]] and [[Oirat language|Oirat]] are independent Mongolic languages, but that such dialects as [[Chakhar dialect|Chakhar]] and [[Ordos dialect|Ordos]] belong to a "Mongolian language".<ref>San<U+017E>eev 1953: 27<U+2013>61, especially 55.</ref> On the other hand, Luvsanvandan (1959) proposed a "Mongolian language" consisting of a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]]) and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties).<ref>Quoted from Sechenbaatar 2005: 167<U+2013>168.</ref> Some Western scholars propose that the relatively well researched Ordos variety is an independent language due to its conservative syllable and [[phoneme]] structure.<ref>For example all the works collected in Janhunen 2003 that address this question.</ref> While the placement of a variety like [[Alasha dialect|Alasha]], which is under the cultural influence of Inner Mongolia but historically tied to Oirat,<ref>Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 265<U+2013>266.</ref> and of other border varieties like [[Darkhad dialect|Darkhad]] must remain problematic in any classification,<ref>Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 266 classify it as a variety of "Inner Mongolian" according to morphological criteria, while Svantesson et al. 2005: 148 classify it as a variety of Oirat according to phonological criteria. For a discussion of opinions on the classification of Darkhad, see San<U+017E>aa and Tujaa 2001: 33<U+2013>34.</ref> the question of how to classify Chakhar, Khalkha and Khorchin in relation to each other and in relation to Buryat and Oirat remains the central problem.<ref>Se<U+010D>enba<U+03B3>atur et al. 2005: 166-173, 184-195. See also Janhunen 2003d: 180.</ref> The split of {{IPA|[t<U+0283>]}} into {{IPA|[t<U+0283>]}} before *i and {{IPA|[ts]}} before all other reconstructed vowels, which is found in Mongolia but not in Inner Mongolia, is often cited as a fundamental distinction,<ref>For example Svantesson et al. 2005: 143, Poppe 1955: 110<U+2013>115.</ref> for example Proto-Mongolic *{{IPA|t<U+0283>}}il, Khalkha {{IPA|[t<U+0283>i<U+026E>]}}, Chakhar {{IPA|[t<U+0283>}}il] 'year' versus Proto-Mongolic *{{IPA|t<U+0283><U+00F8>helen}}, Khalkha {{IPA|[tsoo<U+026E><U+0259><U+014B>]}}, Chakhar {{IPA|[t<U+0283>ool<U+0259><U+014B>]}} 'few'.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2006: 159<U+2013>160; the difference between the l-s might just be due to the impossibility of reconstructing something as detailed as {{IPA|<U+026E>}} for Proto-Mongolic and imprecision or convenience in notation for Chakhar (Chakhar phonemes according to Dobu 1983).</ref> On the other hand, the split between the past tense verbal suffixes -{{IPA|s<U+014B>}} in the Central varieties vs. -{{IPA|d<U+0292><U+025B>:}} in the Eastern varieties<ref>For example <Bi teg<U+00FC>n-i tani{{IPA|<U+01F0>}}ei> I him know-JEI <U+2018>I knew him<U+2019> is accepted and ?<Bi <U+00F6><U+010D><U+00F6>ged<U+00FC>r iregsen> rejected by an Inner Mongolian grammarian from Khorchin (Chuluu 1998: 140, 165); in Khalkha, by contrast, the first sentence would not appear with the meaning attributed to it, while the second is perfectly acceptable.</ref> is usually seen as a merely [[stochastic]] difference.<ref>See, for example, <U+010C>inggeltei 1959. Notice that this split is blurred by the school grammar which treats several dialectal varieties as one coherent grammatical system (for example <U+010C>inggeltei 1999 [1979]). This understanding is in turn reflected in the undecided treatment of -{{IPA|s<U+014B>}} in research work like Bayan<U+010D>o<U+03B3>tu 2002: 306.</ref> 

In Inner Mongolia, official language policy divides the Mongolian language into three dialects: [[South Mongolian language|South Mongolian]], Oirat and Barghu-Buryat. "Inner Mongolian" is said to consist of Chakhar, Ordos, [[Baarin dialect|Baarin]], Khorchin, Kharchin and Alasha; it is assumed that they jointly provide a standard grammar despite their internal grammatical differences. The authorities have established a standard pronunciation based on the Chakhar dialect as spoken in the [[Eight Banners|Plain Blue Banner]].<ref><U+201C><U+00D6>b<U+00FC>r mong<U+03B3>ul ayal<U+03B3>u bol dumdadu ulus-un mong<U+03B3>ul kelen-<U+00FC> sa<U+03B3>uri ayal<U+03B3>u bolqu b<U+00FC>ged dumdadu ulus-un mong<U+03B3>ul kelen-<U+00FC> barim{{IPA|<U+01F0>}}iy-a abiy-a ni <U+010D>aqar aman ayal<U+03B3>un-du sa<U+03B3>uri<U+00F6>a<U+03B3>san bayida<U+03B3>.<U+201C> (Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 85).</ref> While the varieties of "Inner Mongolian" share a literary standard distinct from that of the "Outer Mongolian" Khalkha, a dialectological approach would see a sharper distinction between, for example, the "Inner Mongolian" varieties of Chakhar and Khorchin than between Chakhar and Khalkha.<ref>Janhunen 2003d.</ref>

== Phonology ==

The following description, based on Khalkha as spoken in [[Ulan Bator|Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia's capital, differs considerably from the phoneme systems of varieties such as Chakhar, Ordos, Khorchin and Kharchin.<ref>See Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 206<U+2013>384.</ref>

Short /o/ is [[phonetics|phonetically]] [[Close-mid central rounded vowel|central]] {{IPA|[<U+0275>]}}. Mongolian also has four [[diphthong]]s: {{IPA|/ui, <U+028A>i, <U+0254>i, ai/}}.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 22</ref>

'''Vowel length.''' Pronunciation of long and short [[vowel]]s depends on the [[syllable]]'s position in the word. In word-initial syllables there is a [[phoneme|phonemic]] contrast in length. Here, a long vowel has about 208% the length of a short vowel. In word-internal and word-final syllables, formerly long vowels have been reduced to 127% the length of short word-initial vowels, thus becoming short phonemes, but still being separate from word-initial short vowels as "full vowels". Short non-initial vowels have been reduced to 71% the length of short word-initial vowels and become centralized, in the course losing their status as phonemes and becoming non-phonemic.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 1<U+2013>7, 22<U+2013>24, 73<U+2013>75.</ref>

'''Backness harmony.''' Mongolian divides vowels into two groups in a system of [[vowel harmony]]:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! +ATR ("front")
! -ATR ("back")
! Neutral
|-
| {{IPA|e, u, o}}
| {{IPA|a, <U+028A>, <U+0254>}}
| {{IPA|i}}
|}

For historical reasons, these have traditionally been labeled as "front" vowels and "back" vowels. However, an analysis of these groups under the rubric of [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|advanced tongue root]] or +ATR and non-advanced tongue root or -ATR seems more appropriate. There is also one neutral vowel, /i/, which does not belong to either group.

All the vowels in a non-compound word, including all its suffixes, must belong to the same group. If the first vowel is -ATR, then every vowel of the word must be either {{IPA|/i/}} or a -ATR vowel. Likewise, if the first vowel is a +ATR vowel, then every vowel of the word must be either {{IPA|/i/}} or a +ATR vowel. In the case of suffixes, which must change their vowels to conform to different words, two patterns predominate. Some suffixes can occur with {{IPA|/a, <U+0254>, e, o/}}, following the last phonemic vowel in the [[word stem]], in which case underlying {{IPA|/<U+028A>, u/}} are realized as {{IPA|[a, e]}} respectively. For example:

:{|
| {{IPA|orx}} <U+2018>household<U+2019> || + || {{IPA|-Ar}} (instrumental) || <U+2192> || {{IPA|orxor}} <U+2018>by a household<U+2019>
|-
| {{IPA|xar<U+028A><U+026E>}} <U+2018>sentry<U+2019> || + || {{IPA|-Ar}} (instrumental) || <U+2192> || {{IPA|xar<U+028A><U+026E>ar}} <U+2018>by a sentry<U+2019>
|}

Other suffixes can occur in either {{IPA|/<U+028A>, u/}}, in which case all -ATR vowels lead to {{IPA|/<U+028A>/}} and all +ATR vowels lead to {{IPA|/u/}}. For example:

:{|
| {{IPA|aw}} <U+2018>to take<U+2019> || + || {{IPA|-U<U+026E>}} (causative) || <U+2192> || {{IPA|aw<U+028A><U+026E>}}
|}

If the only vowel in the word stem is {{IPA|/i/}}, the suffixes will use the +ATR suffix forms.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 43<U+2013>50.</ref>

'''Rounding harmony.''' Mongolian also has rounding harmony pertaining to open vowels only. If a stem contains /o/ (or {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}}), a suffix that is specified for an open vowel will have [o] (or {{IPA|[<U+0254>]}}, respectively) as well. However, this process is blocked by the presence of /u/ (or {{IPA|/<U+028A>/}}) and /ei/. Eg {{IPA|<U+0254>r-<U+026E><U+0254>}} 'came in', but {{IPA|<U+0254>r-<U+028A><U+026E>-<U+026E>a}} 'inserted'.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 46<U+2013>47, 50<U+2013>51.</ref>

Mongolian lacks a true phoneme {{IPA|/l/}}; instead, it has a [[voiced alveolar lateral fricative]], {{IPA|/<U+026E>/}}, which is often realized as {{IPA|[<U+026C>]}}.<ref>Karlsson 2005: 17</ref> In word-final position, {{IPA|/n/}} (if not followed by a vowel in historical forms) is realized as {{IPA|[<U+014B>]}}. The consonants in parentheses occur only in loanwords.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 25<U+2013>30.</ref> In the consonant system, the occurrence of palatalized consonant phonemes seems to be restricted to words that contain pharyngeal vowels.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 20<U+2013>21 actually state that they're phonemic only in such words.</ref>

===Syllable structure and phonotactics===

The maximal syllable is CVVCCC where the last C is a word-final suffix. A single short vowel rarely appears in syllable-final position, thus the syllables CV and V are avoided in any position that is not the first syllable of a word that contains at least two syllables. If a word was monosyllabic historically, *CV has become CVV. [<U+014B>] is restricted to codas (else >[n]), and /p/ and {{IPA|/p<U+02B2>/}} don<U+2019>t occur in codas for historical reasons. For two-consonant clusters, the following restrictions obtain: 

* a palatalized consonant can only be preceded by another palatalized consonant or sometimes {{IPA|/<U+0262>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0283>/}} 
* /<U+014B>/ may only precede {{IPA|/<U+0283>, x, g, g<U+02B2>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+0262>/}} 
* /j/ doesn<U+2019>t seem to appear in second position 
* {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/p<U+02B2>/}} don<U+2019>t occur as first consonant and only as second consonant if preceded by /m/ or {{IPA|/<U+026E>/}} or their palatalized counterparts. 

Clusters that do not confirm to these restrictions will be broken up by a [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] non-phonemic vowel in a syllabification that takes place from right to left. For example, ''hojor'' 'two', ''a<U+017E>il'' 'work', and ''saarmag'' 'neutral' are, phonemically, {{IPA|/x<U+0254>jr/}}, {{IPA|/at<U+0283><U+026E>/}}, and {{IPA|/sa<U+02D0>rm<U+0261>/}} respectively. In such cases, an epenthetic vowel is inserted so as to prevent disallowed consonant clusters. Thus, in the examples given above, the words are phonetically {{IPA|[x<U+0254>j<U+0254><U+0306>r]}}, {{IPA|[at<U+0283><U+012D><U+026E>]}}, and {{IPA|[sa<U+02D0>rm<U+0103><U+0261>]}}. The phonetic form of the epenthetic vowel follows from vowel harmony triggered by the vowel in the preceding syllable. Usually it is a [[Relative articulation#Centralized vowels|centralized]] version of the same sound, with the following exceptions: preceding {{IPA|/u/}} produces {{IPA|[e]}}, {{IPA|/i/}} will be ignored if there is a non-neutral vowel earlier in the word, and a postalveolar or palatalized consonant will be followed by an epenthetic {{IPA|[i]}}, as in {{IPA|[at<U+0283><U+012D><U+026E>]}}.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 62<U+2013>72.</ref>

===Stress===

Stress in Mongolian does not distinguish between different meanings and is thus supposed to depend entirely on syllable structure. Beyond this, there is little agreement among scholars.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 95<U+2013>97.</ref> In one line of reasoning, stress falls on the rightmost heavy syllable unless this syllable is word-final:<ref>Walker 1997 developing a line of argument first presented in Bosson 1964 and Poppe 1970.</ref>

A "heavy syllable" is defined here as one that is at least the length of a full vowel; short word-initial syllables are thus excluded. Therefore, if a word is bisyllabic and the only heavy syllable is word-final, it gets stressed anyway. However, in a case where there is only one phonemic short word-initial syllable, even this syllable can get the stress:<ref>Walker<U+2019>s evidence is based on one informant, examples from Poppe 1970 and consultation with James Bosson. She defines stress in terms of pitch, duration and intensity. The analysis pertains to the Khalkha dialect. The phoneme analysis in the examples is adjusted to Svantesson et al. 2005.</ref>

|}

There are other, widely divergent opinions: Most native linguists, independent of dialect, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several works by Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress.<ref>Some works published between 1835 and 1915 state other positions. Moreover, K<U+00F6>ke 2003 seems to contain yet another, new position. See Svantesson et al. 2005: 95<U+2013>97 and the literature cited there.</ref>

== Grammar  ==
The following description is based primarily on Standard Khalkha Mongolian (ie standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar as distinct from actual research into the linguistic behaviour of certain groups of individuals), but much of it is also valid for Southern Central Mongolian, especially Chakhar.<ref>See Sechenbaatar et al. 2005 for Chakhar and Bayan<U+010D>o<U+03B3>tu 2002 for the somewhat more diverse Khorchin.</ref>

=== Morphology ===

Modern Mongolian is an [[agglutination|agglutinative]], almost exclusively suffixing language;<ref>The only expection being reduplication; see Svantesson et al. 2005: 58<U+2013>59.</ref> the suffixes are most often composed of a single [[morpheme]]. It has a rich number of morphemes to build up more complex words from simple [[root (linguistics)|roots]]. For example, the word <bajguullagynh> consists of the root <baj-> <U+2018>to be<U+2019>, an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] <-g->, the [[causative]] <-uul-> (then <U+2018>to found<U+2019>), the [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivative]] suffix <-laga> that forms nouns created by the action (<U+2018>organisation<U+2019>) and the complex suffix <<U+2013>ynh> denoting something that belongs to the modified word (<-yn> would be [[genitive case|genitive]]).<ref>For a detailed description of the derivational morphology of Mongolian, see Se<U+010D>en 2004.</ref>

Nominal [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] are quite frequent. Some derivational verbal suffixes are rather [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]], eg <jar<U+2019>-> 'to speak', <jarilts-> 'to speak with each other'. Formally, verbal suffixes that create independent words can roughly be divided into three classes: final [[verb]]s, which can only be used sentence-finally, i.e. <-na> (mainly future or generic statements) or <U+2013><U+00F8> (second person imperative);<ref>Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 151<U+2013>153, 161<U+2013>163.</ref> [[participle]]s (often called <U+201C>verbal nouns<U+201D>), which can be used clause-finally or attributively, i.e. <-san> ([[perfect aspect|perfect]]-[[past tense|past]])<ref>Hashimoto 1993.</ref> or <-maar> (<U+2018>want to<U+2019>); and [[converb]]s, which can link clauses or function [[adverbial]]ly, i.e. <-<U+017E>> (qualifies for any adverbial function or neutrally connects two [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]) or <-tal> (the action of the main [[clause]] takes place until the action expressed by the suffixed verb begins).<ref>Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 103<U+2013>104, 124<U+2013>125, 130<U+2013>131.</ref>

Roughly speaking, Mongolian has eight [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]] ([[markedness|unmarked]]), [[genitive case|genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]], [[comitative case|comitative]] and [[allative case|directional]].<ref>Cedendamba and M<U+00F6><U+00F6>m<U+00F6><U+00F6> 1997: 222<U+2013>232.</ref> A direct object must take the accusative if it is [[definiteness|definite]], while it may not take it if it is indefinite and [[Specificity|unspecific]].<ref>Guntsetseg 2008: 61.</ref> In addition to case, a number of [[Preposition and postposition|postpositions]] exist that usually govern genitive, ablative or comitative case or an oblique form, that is, the stem plus sometimes -Vn either for lexical historical reasons or [[analogy]] (thus maybe becoming an attributive case suffix).<ref>Sechenbaatar 2003: 32<U+2013>46.</ref> [[Noun]]s can take reflexive-possessive [[clitic]]s indicating that the marked noun is possessed by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence: <Bi najz(-)aa avarsan> I friend-reflexive-possessive save-perfect <U+2018>I saved my friend<U+2019>.<ref>Cedendamba and M<U+00F6><U+00F6>m<U+00F6><U+00F6> 1997: 234<U+2013>241.</ref> There are also somewhat noun-like [[adjective]]s that, however, seem to be only able to immediately take case suffixes in the case of [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]].<ref>For a pioneering approach to this problem, see Sajto 1999.</ref> [[Plural]]ity may be unmarked, but there are overt markers some of which are restricted to humans. A noun that is modified by a numeral usually doesn't take any plural affix.<ref>Cedendamba and M<U+00F6><U+00F6>m<U+00F6><U+00F6> 1997: 210<U+2013>219, Sechenbaatar 2003: 23<U+2013>29.</ref>

[[Personal pronoun]]s exist for the first and second person, while the old [[demonstrative pronoun]]s have come to form third person (proximal and distal) pronouns. Other word (sub-)classes include [[interrogative pronoun]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]] (which take participles), [[spatials]] and quite a few [[grammatical particle|particles]].<ref>Word classes are treated with some simplification here. For a more precise treatment within the descriptive framework common in Inner Mongolia, see Sechenbaatar 2003.</ref>

[[negation (linguistics)|Negation]] is mostly expressed by <-g<U+00FC>j> after participles and by the negation particle <bi<U+0161>> after nouns and adjectives; negation particles preceding the verb (for example in converbal constructions) exist, but tend to be replaced by analytical constructions.<ref>For the historic background of negation, see Yu 1991. For a phenomenology, see Bjambasan 2001.</ref>

=== Syntax ===
==== Phrase structure ====

The [[noun phrase]] has the order: demonstrative pronoun/[[number names|numeral]], adjective, noun.<ref>Guntsetseg 2008: 55.</ref> Attributive sentences precedes the whole NP. Titles or occupations of people, low numerals indicating groups and [[topic-comment|focus]] clitics are put behind the head noun.<ref>Tserenpil and Kullmann 2005: 237, 347.</ref> [[Possessive pronoun]]s (in different forms) may either precede or follow the NP.<ref>Svantesson 2003: 164<U+2013>165.</ref> Eg <bidnij uulzsan ter sajhan zaluugaas <U+010D>> we-genitive meet-perfective that beautiful young_man-ablative focus <U+2018>even from that beautiful young man that we have met<U+2019>, <Dor<U+017E> bag<U+0161> maan<U+2019>> Dorj teacher our <U+2018>our teacher Dorj<U+2019>.

The verbal phrase consists of the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]<U+2019>s [[complement (linguistics)|complements]] and the adverbials modifying it in front of it and, mainly if the predicate is sentence-final, [[modal particle]]s<ref>See M<U+00F6>nh-Amgalan 1998.</ref> behind it. For example, <Ter helehg<U+00FC>jgeer <U+00FC>nijg bi<U+010D>sen <U+0161><U+00FC><U+00FC>> S/he without_saying it-accusative write-perfective particle <U+2018>She wrote it without saying [i.e. that she would do so] (so I can assure you).<U+2019> In this clause the adverbial should precede the complement as it is itself derived from a verb and could take <U+2018>it<U+2019> as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective <U+00E0> la <hurdan> 'fast', it could immediately precede the predicate. There are also instances in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.<ref>Sechenbaatar 2003: 167.</ref>

The predicate itself may consist of a noun or an adjective with or without a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]].<ref>Hashimoto 2004 discusses differences between several types of predicative noun constructions.</ref> Most often, of course, a verb is used. [[coverb|Auxiliaries]] that express direction and [[aktionsart]] among other meanings can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the position immediately behind the verb, eg <uu<U+017E> orhison> drink-CV leave-perfect 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary <baj-> <U+2018>to be<U+2019>, eg <Ter g<U+00FC>j<U+017E> bajna> s/he run-converb be-nonpast <U+2018>She is running<U+2019>. Meanings expressed in this position are [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]] in nature, eg [[progressive aspect|progressive]] and [[resultative]]. In the next position, participles followed by <baj-> may follow, eg <Ter irsen bajna> s/he come-perfect be-nonpast <U+2018>He has come<U+2019>. Here, an explicit [[perfect tense|perfect]] and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual meaning as well. This position can be occupied more than once in one predication, and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality and aspect.<ref>The most complete treatment of the verbal forms mentioned here for Khalkha is Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987. However, the analysis of predication presented here, while valid for Khalkha, is adapted from Matsuoka 2007, who describes Khorchin.</ref>

==== Clauses ====

Unmarked phrase order is [[subject (grammar)|subject]]<U+2013>[[object (grammar)|object]]<U+2013>predicate.<ref>Guntsetseg 2008: 54.</ref> While the predicate generally has to remain in clause-final position, the other phrases are free to change order or to wholly disappear.<ref>Tserenpil and Kullmann 2005: 88, 363<U+2013>364.</ref> The topic tends to be placed clause-initially, new information rather at the end of the clause.<ref>Apatoczky 2005.</ref> Topic can be overtly marked with <bol> that can also mark contrastive focus,<ref>Hammar 1983: 45<U+2013>80.</ref> overt additive focus ('even, also') can be marked with the clitic <<U+010D>>,<ref>Kang 2000.</ref> overt restrictive focus with the clitic <l> ('only').<ref>Tserenpil and Kullmann 2005: 348<U+2013>349.</ref>

Mongolian has passive and [[causative]] [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. In a passive sentence the entirely oblique agent takes either dative or instrumental case, the first of which is more common. The verb takes a suffix <-gd->. In the causative, the person caused to do something would take instrumental, or accusative, if the simple verb would have been intransitive, and the verb would take <-uul->. Causative morphology is also used in some passive contexts: <Bi t<U+00FC><U+00FC>nd <U+010D>aduulsan> I s/he-dative fool-caustive-perfective <U+2018>I was fooled by her/him<U+2019>. [[Animacy]] is an important component, thus English 'The bread was eaten by me' would not be acceptable in Mongolian. <-ld-> ([[reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]]), <-tsgaa-> ([[plurative]]) and <-lts-> (cooperative) are voice constructions as well.<ref>Sechenbaatar 2003: 116<U+2013>123.</ref>

Mongolian allows for adjectival depictives that either relate to the subject or the direct object, eg <Ljena n<U+00FC>cgen untdag> <U+2018>Lena sleeps naked<U+2019>, while adjectival resultatives are marginal.<ref>Brosig 2009.</ref>

==== Complex sentences ====

One way to conjoin clauses is to have the first clause end in a converb. An example: <Bid <U+00FC><U+00FC>nijg olbol <U+010D>amd <U+00F6>gn<U+00F6>> we it-accusative find-conditional_converbal_suffix you-dative give-future <U+2018>If we find it we<U+2019>ll give it to you<U+2019>. Some verbal nouns in the instrumental or most often dative function very similar to converbs:<ref>Svantesson 2003: 172.</ref> above sentence with <olohod> find-imperfective-dative <U+2018>When I find it I<U+2019>ll give it to you<U+2019>. Quite often, postpositions govern complete clauses. In contrast, conjunctions take verbal nouns without case:<ref>See Sechenbaatar 2003: 176<U+2013>182 (who uses the term <U+201C>postposition<U+201D> for both and the term <U+201C>conjunction<U+201D> for junctors).</ref> <jadarsan u<U+010D>raas untlaa> become_tired-perfective because sleep-witnessed_perfective 'I slept because I was tired'. Finally, there are usually clause-initial particles with relating meaning: <Bi olson, harin <U+010D>amd <U+00F6>g<U+00F6>hg<U+00FC>j> I find-perfective but you-dative give-imperfective-negation <U+2018>I<U+2019>ve found it, but I won<U+2019>t give it to you<U+2019>.

Mongolian has a [[complementizer]] [[auxiliary verb]] <ge-> very similar to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''to iu''. <ge-> literally means <U+2018>to say<U+2019> and in converbal form <ge<U+017E>> precedes a psych verb or verb of saying. As a verbal noun like <gedeg> (with <n<U+2019>> or case) it can form a subset of complement clauses. As <gene> it may function as an [[evidentiality|evidentialis]] marker.<ref>Sechenbaatar 2003: 152<U+2013>153.</ref>

Mongolian clauses tend to be arranged in a [[parataxis (grammar)|paratactic]] order, allowing for clauses that are syntactically subordinate, but resemble coordinated structures in European languages:<ref>Johanson 1995.</ref> <Ter ireed namajg <U+00FC>nssen> that come-converb me_accusative kiss-perfect <U+2018>S/he came and kissed me.<U+2019>

In the [[subordinate clause]] the subject, if different from the subject of [[main clause]], sometimes has to take accusative or genitive case.<ref>Mizuno 1995.</ref> Subjects in either the ablative case marginally occur as well.<ref>P<U+00FC>rev-O<U+010D>ir 1997: 131.</ref> Subjects of attribute clauses in which the head has a function (as is the case for all English [[relative clause]]s) demand that if the subject is not the [[head (linguistics)|head]] it usually takes the genitive case,<ref>Sechenbaatar 2003: 36.</ref> eg <t<U+00FC><U+00FC>nij idsen hool> that_one-genitive eat-perfective meal <U+2018>the meal that s/he had eaten<U+2019>.

== Lexicon ==

The Mongolian vocabulary includes historic [[loanword]]s especially from [[Old Turkic]], [[Sanskrit]] (often through [[Old Turkic|Uigur]]), [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Tibetan language|Tibetan]],<ref>Tem<U+00FC>r<U+010D>ereng 2004: 86<U+2013>99.</ref> [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]<ref>Svantesson 2003: 127.</ref> and keeps adopting more recent ones from [[Russian language|Russian]], [[English language|English]]<ref>Tem<U+00FC>r<U+010D>ereng 2004: 99<U+2013>102.</ref> and Chinese (mainly in Inner Mongolia).<ref><U+00D6>b<U+00FC>r mong<U+03B3>ul-un yeke sur<U+03B3>a<U+03B3>uli 2005: 792<U+2013>793.</ref> Commissions in the Mongolian state have been busy translating new [[terminology]] into Mongolian,<ref>{{cite web|author=Baabar|url=http://publish.news.mn/show/id=595|title=Jum bolgon nertej|work=<U+00D6>drijn sonin|publisher=News.mn|date=2008-12-09|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> so that Mongolian words such as 'president' <jer<U+00F6>nhijl<U+00F6>g<U+010D>> ("generalizer") and 'beer' <<U+0161>ar ajrag> ("yellow kumys") exist. There are quite a few [[calque|loan translations]], eg <galt tereg> ('fire-having  cart') 'train' from Chinese hu<U+01D2>ch<U+0113> (<U+706B><U+8F66>, fire cart) 'train'.<ref><U+00D6>b<U+00FC>r mong<U+03B3>ul-un yeke sur<U+03B3>a<U+03B3>uli 2005: 828.</ref>

== Writing systems ==
{{main|Mongolian writing systems}}

Mongolian has been written in a variety of alphabets. The traditional [[Mongolian script]] was adapted from [[Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur script]] probably at the very beginning of the 13th century and from that time underwent some minor disambiguations and supplementations. Between 1930 and 1932, a short-lived attempt was made to introduce the Latin script in the Mongolian state, and after a preparatory phase, the [[Cyrillic]] script was declared as mandatory by government decree. From 1991 to 1994, an attempt was made to reintroduce the traditional alphabet which failed due to popular resistance.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 34, 40<U+2013>41.</ref> In informal contexts of electronic text production, the use of Latin is common as well.<ref name=MHK>{{cite web|author=S<U+00FC>hbaatar, B|url=http://www.infocon.mn/english/reference/GaligiinTuhai.htm|title=Mongol helnij kirill <U+00FC>sgijg latin <U+00FC>sgeer galiglah tuhaj|publisher=InfoCon|accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref>

In the [[People's Republic of China]], Mongolian is a co-official language with [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]] in some regions, notably the entire [[Inner Mongolia]] Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet has always been used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the [[Sino-Soviet split]].<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 34, 40.</ref> There are two types of written Mongolian used in China: the classical script, which is official among Mongols nationwide, and the [[Clear script]], used predominantly among [[Oirats]] in [[Xinjiang]].<ref>Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 398.</ref>

The modified Cyrillic alphabet used for Mongolian is as follows:

==Historical Mongolian==

[[Image:Phagspa imperial edict dragon year.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Edict of [[Yes<U+00FC>n Tem<U+00FC>r Khan, Emperor Taiding of Yuan|Yis<U+00FC>ntem<U+00FC>r]] (1328). Only the [[Phagspa]] script retains the complete [[Middle Mongolian language|Middle Mongolian]] vowel system.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 111.</ref>]]
The earliest surviving Mongolian text is the Stele of Yis<U+00FC>ngge, a report on sports in [[Mongolian script]] on stone, that is most often dated at the verge of 1224 and 1225.<ref>Eg <U+0393>arudi 2002: 7.</ref> Other early sources are written in Mongolian, [[Phagspa script|Phagspa]] (decrees), [[Chinese character|Chinese]] (''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''), [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] (dictionaries) and a few Western scripts.<ref>Rybatzki 2003: 58</ref> These comprise the [[Middle Mongolian language]] that was spoken from the 13th to the early 15th<ref name="Rybatzki 2003: 57">Rybatzki 2003: 57.</ref> or late 16th century.<ref>Poppe 1964: 1.</ref>  The documents in Mongolian script show some distinct linguistic characteristics and are therefore often distinguished by terming their language "Preclassical Mongolian".<ref name="Rybatzki 2003: 57"/> The next distinct period is [[Classical Mongolian language|Classical Mongolian]] that is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. It is a written language with a high degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian [[Kanjur]] and [[Tanjur]]<ref>Janhunen 2003a: 32.</ref> as well as several chronicles.<ref>Okada 1984.</ref> In 1686, the [[Soyombo script]] (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.<ref>Nadmid 1967: 98<U+2013>102.</ref>

===Changes in phonology===
====Consonants====

Middle Mongolian documents show only two velar plosives <g> and <k> (and one allophone for each), but in some instances the <g> disappeared and in others not. There is no hint as to how this might be related to contextual factors, and while there is a hypothesis that this is related to distinctive vowel length or stress,<ref>eg T<U+00F6>m<U+00F6>rtogoo 2005.</ref> it is disputed whether there is any factual evidence for this. Now there is a word-initial <h> that disappeared during the Middle Mongolian stage. This might be the same phoneme as one of the instances of <g> (possibly {{IPA|[x]}}). Thus, it is likely that x <U+2192> h <U+2192> <U+00D8>.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 113, 119<U+2013>124.</ref> Eg Phagspa <haran>, Preclassical Mongolian <aran>, reconstructed in Proto-Mongolic as *haran <U+2018>person<U+2019>, became Modern Mongolian <aran>.<ref>Today, /arn/ is somewhat unusual, but its plural /ard/ <U+2018>people<U+2019> is common.</ref> Phagspa <U+010D>aqa<U+2019>an, Preclassical <U+010D>a<U+03B3>a<U+03B3>an,<ref>Adapted from T<U+00F6>m<U+00F6>rtogoo 2002: 80.</ref> reconstructed for Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic as {{IPA|*t<U+0283><U+02B0>agahan}} <U+2018>white<U+2019>, became Modern Mongolian {{IPA|/ts<U+02B0>agan/}}. As also apparent from this example, affricates were fronted in Northern Modern Mongolian dialects such as Khalkha. {{IPA|/k<U+02B0>/}} was [[spirantization|spirantized]] to {{IPA|/x/}} in Ulaanbaatar Khalkha and the Mongolian dialects south of it, eg Preclassical Mongolian <k<U+00FC>nd<U+00FC>>, reconstructed as {{IPA|*k<U+02B0>ynty}} <U+2018>heavy<U+2019>, became Modern Mongolian {{IPA|/xunt/}}<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 133, 167.</ref> (but in the vinicity of [[Bayankhongor]] and [[Baruun-Urt]], many speakers will say {{IPA|[k<U+02B0>unt]}}).<ref>Rinchen (ed.) (1979): 210.</ref> Originally word-final /n/ turned into /<U+014B>/; if {{IPA|*n}} was originally followed by a vowel that later dropped, it remained unchanged, eg {{IPA|*k<U+02B0>en}} became {{IPA|/xi<U+014B>/}}, but {{IPA|*k<U+02B0>oina}} became {{IPA|/x<U+0254>in/}}. After i-breaking, {{IPA|*[<U+0283>]}} became phonemic. Consonants in words containing back vowels that were followed by {{IPA|*i}} in Proto-Mongolian became [[Palatalization|palatalized]] in Modern Mongolian. In some words, word-final {{IPA|*n}} was dropped with most case forms, but still appears with the ablative, dative and genitive.<ref>Svantesson et al. 2005: 124, 165<U+2013>166, 205.</ref>

====Vowels====

Proto-Mongolic had {{IPA|*i, *e, *y, *<U+00F8>, *u, *o, *a}}. First, {{IPA|*o}} and {{IPA|*u}} were [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] to {{IPA|/<U+0254>/}} and {{IPA|/<U+028A>/}}, then {{IPA|*y}} and {{IPA|*<U+00F8>}} were [[velarization|velarized]] to {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}. Thus, the vowel harmony shifted from a velar to a pharyngeal paradigm. {{IPA|*i}} in the first syllable of back-vocalic words was [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] to the following vowel; in word-initial position it became {{IPA|/ja/}}. {{IPA|*e}} followed by {{IPA|*y}} was rounded to {{IPA|*<U+00F8>}}. VhV and VjV sequences where the second vowel was any vowel but {{IPA|*i}} were monophthongized. Short vowels in any syllable but the first were deleted from the phonetic representation of the word; long vowels in these positions became short vowels.<ref>Svantesson 2005: 181, 184, 186<U+2013>187, 190<U+2013>195.</ref>

Eg {{IPA|*imahan}} ({{IPA|*i}} becomes {{IPA|/ja/}}, {{IPA|*h}} disappears) <U+2192> {{IPA|*jama<U+02D0>n}} (instable n drops; vowel reduction) <U+2192> jama(n) <U+2018>goat<U+2019>

and {{IPA|*emys-}} (regressive rounding assimilation) <U+2192> {{IPA|*<U+00F8>mys-}} (vowel velarization) <U+2192> {{IPA|*omus-}} (vowel reduction) <U+2192> oms- <U+2018>to wear<U+2019>

===Changes in morphology===
====Nominal system====

[[Image:Secret history.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'' is the only document that allows the reconstruction of gender agreement in Middle Mongolian.<ref>T<U+00FC>men<U+010D>e<U+010D>eg 1990.</ref>]]
While most case suffixes did change somewhat in form, ie were shortened, most of the modern case system remained intact; important changes occurred with the comitative and the dative.<ref>Rybatzki 2003: 67, Svantesson 2003: 162.</ref> The Middle Mongolian comitative <-lu<U+03B3>-a> could not be used attributively, but it was replaced by the suffix <-taj> that originally derived adjectives denoting possession of the stem from nouns, eg <mori-tai> <U+2018>having a horse<U+2019> became <mor<U+2019>toj> <U+2018>having a horse/with a horse<U+2019>. As this adjective functioned parallel to <<U+00FC>gej> <U+2018>not having<U+2019>, it has been suggested that a <U+201C>privative case<U+201D> (<U+2018>without<U+2019>) has been introduced into Mongolian.<ref>Janhunen 2003c: 27.</ref> There have been three different case suffixes in the dative-locative-directive domain that are grouped in different ways: <-a> as locative and <-dur>, <-da> as dative<ref>Rybatzki 2003: 68.</ref> or <-da> and <-a> as dative and <-dur> as locative,<ref><U+0393>arudi 2002: 101<U+2013>107.</ref> in both cases with some functional overlapping. As <-dur> seems to be grammaticalized from <dotur-a> <U+2018>within<U+2019>, thus indicating a span of time,<ref>To<U+03B3>tambayar 2006: 18<U+2013>35.</ref> the second account seems to be more likely. Of these, <-da> got lost, <-dur> was first reduced to <-du> and then to /d/<ref>To<U+03B3>tambayar 2006: 33<U+2013>34.</ref> and <-a> only survived in a few frozen environments.<ref>Nor<U+010D>in et al. (ed.) 1999: 2217.</ref> Finally, the directive of modern Mongolian <-ruu> has been innovated from <uru<U+03B3>u> 'downwards'.<ref>Sechenbaatar et al. 2005: 228, 386.</ref> Gender agreement was abandoned.<ref>Rybatzki 2003: 73, Svantesson 2003: 166.</ref>

==== Verbal system ====

Middle Mongolian had a slightly greater set of declarative final verb suffix forms<ref>Weiers 1966: 126<U+2013>180, Svantesson 2003: 166.</ref> and a smaller number of participles which were less likely to be used as finite predicates.<ref>Weiers 1966: 181<U+2013>213, Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 86<U+2013>104.</ref> The linking converb <-n> became confined to stable verb combinations,<ref>Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 126, <U+010C>inggeltei 1999: 251<U+2013>252.</ref> while the number of converbs somewhat increased.<ref>Rybatzki 2003: 77, Luvsanvandan (ed.) 1987: 126<U+2013>137</ref> The gender and number distinction exhibited by some final verbs got lost.<ref>The gender issue is fairly commonplace, see eg Rybatzki 2003: 75. A convincing argument for the number distinction between -''ba'' and -''bai'' is made in T<U+00FC>men<U+010D>e<U+010D>eg 1990: 103<U+2013>108. She also argues that this has been the case for other suffixes.</ref>

===Changes in syntax===

Neutral word order in clauses with pronominal subject changed from object<U+2013>predicate<U+2013>subject to subject<U+2013>object<U+2013>predicate, eg

:''K<U+00F6>kse<U+00FC> sabraq <U+00FC>g<U+00FC>.le-run   'ayyi. yeke uge ugu.le-d ta ...' kee-j<U+00FC><U+00FC>.y.''
:K.     s.     speak-converb alas big word speak-Past you say-nonfuture
:'K<U+00F6>kse<U+00FC> sabraq spoke saying "Alas. You speak a great boast. ..."'<ref>Street 1957: 14, ''Secret History'' 190.13v.</ref>

The negation of verbs shifted from negation particles preceding final verbs to a negation particle following participles; thus, as final verbs could no longer be negated, their paradigm of negation was filled by particles.<ref>Yu 1991.</ref> For example, Preclassical Mongolian <ese irebe> 'did not come' vs. modern spoken Mongolian <ireeg<U+00FC>j> (modern written Mongolian <irege <U+00FC>gei>) 'did not come (yet)' or <irseng<U+00FC>j> 'did not come (then)'.
