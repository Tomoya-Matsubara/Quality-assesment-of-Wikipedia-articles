"'''Homer's Enemy'''" is the twenty-third episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]] of the [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It was first broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on May 4, 1997. The episode's plot centers on the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]'s hiring a new employee named [[List of one-time characters in The Simpsons#Season 8|Frank Grimes]]. Despite [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]'s attempts to befriend him, Grimes is angered by Homer's laziness and incompetence and his ability to lead a comfortable life despite these flaws. He eventually declares himself Homer's enemy. Meanwhile, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] buys a run-down factory for a dollar.

"Homer's Enemy" was directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and the script was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], based on an idea pitched by executive producer [[Bill Oakley]]. The episode explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] hired for a job where he has to work alongside a man like Homer. The show's staff worked hard to perfect the character of Frank Grimes. He was partially modeled after [[Michael Douglas]] as he appeared in the film ''[[Falling Down]]''. [[Hank Azaria]] provided the voice of Frank Grimes, and based some of the character's mannerisms on actor [[William H. Macy]]. [[Frank Welker]] guest stars as the voice of the Executive Vice President dog.

In its original broadcast on the Fox network, "Homer's Enemy" acquired a 7.7 [[Nielsen rating]]. It was viewed in approximately 7.5 million homes, finishing the week ranked 56th. "Homer's Enemy" is considered to be one of the darkest episodes of ''The Simpsons'' and is a favorite of several members of the production staff<U+2014>including Bill Oakley, [[Josh Weinstein]], and [[Matt Groening]]<U+2014>and of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' creator [[Ricky Gervais]]. Although Grimes makes his only appearance in this episode, he was later named one of the "Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral characters" by [[IGN]]. Frank Grimes has since been referenced several times in the show, often showing his tombstone, and occasionally mentioning him by name. In the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]] episode "[[The Great Louse Detective]]", it is revealed that he fathered a son named Frank Grimes, Jr., who unsuccessfully tries to kill Homer.

== Plot ==
In a new segment of "Kent's People", [[Kent Brockman]] tells the story of [[List of one-time characters in The Simpsons#Season 8|Frank Grimes]], a man who "had to struggle for everything he ever got" and overcame such disasters as being abandoned by his family and severely injured in a silo explosion to earn a degree in nuclear physics. After seeing the show, Springfield Nuclear Power Plant owner [[Mr. Burns]] is so touched that he asks [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] to hire Grimes as his Executive Vice President. However, the following day, Burns sees a similarly sentimental story concerning a heroic dog (who saved a child from traffic and pushed a wanted criminal into it) and demands that it instead be appointed Executive Vice President. Consequently, Grimes is shuffled into Sector 7G, where he must work alongside [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], and [[Carl Carlson|Carl]]. Grimes takes an instant dislike to Homer, irked by his obnoxious cheerfulness, poor work ethic, and general irresponsibility. Despite his frustration, Grimes prevents Homer from drinking a beaker of [[sulfuric acid]], dramatically slapping it out of Homer's hands into a wall, disintegrating a portion of it. A passing Mr. Burns admonishes Grimes for destroying the "valuable" wall and spilling his "priceless" acid, resulting in Grimes being punished with a reduced salary and status. An angered Grimes marches into Homer's work area and declares that they are now enemies, and a surprised Homer asks "Do I have to do anything?"

In a [[subplot]], Bart becomes bored during a visit to Springfield Town Hall and buys "35 Industry Way" for a [[United States dollar|dollar]] during a foreclosure [[auction]]. It turns out to be a run-down old factory. He and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] spend their days wrecking the factory until one morning Bart returns to find it has collapsed during the night while Milhouse was on watch duty.

Homer attempts to appease Grimes by inviting him to his home for a lobster dinner. Grimes' visit to the Simpson house only fuels his resentment; he is incensed by Homer's ability to live a comfortable life with a wonderful family despite his slothful and ignorant ways while Grimes ends up with his extreme difficulties. Declaring Homer a "fraud" and stating that in any other country on Earth he would have died long ago, a bitter Grimes storms away in anger. The following day, Homer again attempts to earn Grimes' respect by acting as a model employee, but his efforts fail. When Grimes vents his frustration with Homer to Lenny and Carl, they merely tell him to "give Homer a break", so Grimes sets out to prove that Homer has the intelligence of a six-year-old. To prove his point, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to children, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism; Grimes glee at seeing Homer leave to start the contest vanishes when Homer smashes his car into Grimes' vehicle.

At the awards ceremony, Grimes is told to be quiet while heckling Homer's efforts, and Mr. Burns awards Homer first prize. Instead of laughing at Homer, his co-workers applaud and cheer him. This causes Grimes to finally snap and manically he runs through the plant, mimicking Homer's bad habits. Declaring that he does not need safety gloves, Grimes grabs a high voltage cable and is fatally electrocuted. At Grimes' funeral, Homer falls asleep and drowsily tells Marge to change the TV channel, causing the attending mourners to laugh and Lenny to declare "That's our Homer!" as the coffin is lowered into the grave.

"Homer's Enemy"  was written by [[John Swartzwelder]], directed by [[Jim Reardon]] and executive produced by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]]. One of the goals of Oakley and Weinstein was to create several episodes in each season which would "push the envelope conceptually."<ref name="Weinstein"/> The idea for the episode was first conceived by [[Bill Oakley]] who thought that Homer should have an enemy. The thought evolved into the concept of a "real world" co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results.<ref name="Weinstein"/> The result was the character of Grimes, a man who had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

"Homer's Enemy" explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In an essay for the book ''Leaving Springfield'', Robert Sloane describes the episode as "an incisive consideration of ''The Simpsons'''s world. Although ''The Simpsons'' is known for its self-reflectivity, the show had never looked at (or critiqued) itself as directly as it does in ["Homer's Enemy"]."<ref>{{harvnb|Sloane|2003|p=149}}</ref> In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.<ref name="Weinstein"/><ref name="Turner"/> By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering "real American hero,"<ref name=Turner/> is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.<ref name="Turner">{{harvnb|Turner|2004|p=99<U+2013>106}}</ref> In an interview with ''Simpsons'' fan site [[NoHomers.net]], Josh Weinstein said:

{{cquote|We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was "What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?" I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [on NoHomers.net] about the ending<U+2014>we just did that because (a) it<U+2019>s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of "sometimes, you just can't win"<U+2014>the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned.<ref name="NoHomers">[http://www.nohomers.net/showthread.php?t=51876&page=2 Ask Bill & Josh] ''[[NoHomers.net]]''. Published on November 2, 2005, Retrieved on March 26, 2007</ref>}}

The animators and character designers had a lot of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut",<ref name="Reardon">{{cite video | people=Reardon, Jim|date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Enemy"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> but would later be modeled after [[Michael Douglas]] in the movie ''[[Falling Down]]''<ref name="Weinstein"/> and director Jim Reardon's college roommate.<ref name="Reardon"/> [[Hank Azaria]] provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Azaria felt that the role should instead go to [[William H. Macy]]. According to Azaria, "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior.<ref name="Azaria"/> The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution."<ref name="Azaria">{{cite video | people=Azaria, Hank|date=2006|title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode "Homer's Enemy"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Josh Weinstein has expressed regret about killing off Grimes after only one episode, describing him as "such an amazing character."<ref name="Weinstein"/> In an interview with ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'', producer [[George Meyer]] said, "Grimes's cardinal sin was that he shined a light on Springfield. He pointed out everything that was wrongheaded and idiotic about that world. And the people who do that tend to become martyrs. He said things that needed to be said, but once they were said, we needed to destroy that person. I<U+2019>ll admit, we took a certain sadistic glee in his downfall. He was such a righteous person, and that somehow made his demise more satisfying."<ref name="Believer">{{cite news|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200409/?read=interview_meyer|title=Interview with George Meyer|accessdate=2011-01-03|work=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]|date=September 2004}}</ref>

The subplot, where Bart buys a factory, was added so that there would be some lighter scenes to split up the main plot. According to Weinstein, "we wanted to have a Bart or Lisa kids story to contrast the heaviness and reality of Frank Grimes."<ref name="Weinstein"/>

In its original broadcast on the Fox network, "Homer's Enemy" acquired a 7.7 [[Nielsen rating]].

According to Josh Weinstein, when the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered.<ref name="Weinstein"/> Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which he thinks many fans "didn't get."<ref name="Weinstein"/> Weinstein also talks about a "generation gap"<U+2014>he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

Critical opinion of the episode is mixed. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, authors of ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', described the episode as "one of the series' darkest episodes [that] ends on a real downer but is nevertheless also one of the wittiest and cleverest in ages."<ref name=bbc/>  In 2007, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' called "Homer's Enemy" the seventh best episode of ''The Simpsons''. John Orvted said it was, "the darkest Simpsons episode ever... To see [Grimes] fail, and ultimately be destroyed, once he enters Homer's world is hilarious and satisfying."<ref>{{cite news | author = John Orvted | title = Springfield's Best | publisher = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date = 2007-07-05 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/top10simpsons200708 | accessdate=2007-07-13}}</ref> Comedian [[Rick Mercer]] called it a "great episode, and one of the darkest ever produced."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20030201/RVSIMS/Arts/thearts/thearts_temp/5/5/44/|title=My favourite episode|author=Caldwell, Rebecca; Shoalts David|accessdate=2008-09-11|date=2003-03-01|publisher=The Globe and Mail|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930072501/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/PEstory/TGAM/20030201/RVSIMS/Arts/thearts/thearts_temp/5/5/44/ |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Jon Bonn<U+00E9> of [[MSNBC]] used "Homer's Enemy" as an example of a bad episode of the eighth season and wrote "even now [in 2000], when subsequent episodes have debased Homer in new and innovative ways, the Grimes episode stands out as painful to watch."<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341527/|title=<U+2018>The Simpsons<U+2019> has lost its cool|author=Bonn<U+00E9>, Jon|accessdate=2008-09-19|date=2000-10-10|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
Frank Grimes has since been referenced several times in the show, often showing his tombstone, and occasionally mentioning him by name. In the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]] episode "[[The Great Louse Detective]]", it is revealed that he fathered a son named Frank Grimes, Jr., who tries and fails to kill Homer. The footage of Grimes's death is also shown during that episode. Homer doesn't remember Frank Sr. at first, and when he does he enrages Jr. by asking how Sr. is doing. Jr. also reveals that while his dad wasn't married, he was conceived because Sr. "liked hookers, OK?" <ref name="Louse">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/1406.htm|title=The Great Louse Detective|accessdate=2007-05-07|publisher=TheSimpsons.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070505020310/http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/1406.htm |archivedate = 2007-05-05}}</ref> During the nuclear power plant design contest, one of the entrants is [[Ralph Wiggum]], whose entry is rejected by Mr. Burns.
