'''Cao Ang''' (c. 177-197),<ref name="RDC birth and death years" /> [[Chinese style name|style name]] '''Zixiu''', was the eldest son of [[Cao Cao]], a warlord who rose to power towards the [[end of the Han Dynasty]] and laid the foundation of the state of [[Cao Wei]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

==Life==
Cao Ang was the first son of [[Cao Cao]] and his concubine Lady Liu (<U+5289><U+592B><U+4EBA>). Lady Liu also bore Cao Cao another son ([[Cao Shuo (Han Dynasty)|Cao Shuo]]) and a daughter (Princess Qinghe (<U+6E05><U+6CB3><U+516C><U+4E3B>)).<ref>(<U+6B66><U+7687><U+5E1D><U+4E8C><U+5341><U+4E94><U+7537><U+FF1A> ... <U+5289><U+592B><U+4EBA><U+751F><U+8C50><U+610D><U+738B><U+6602><U+3001><U+76F8><U+6BA4><U+738B><U+9460><U+FF0C> ...)

Little was recorded in history about Cao Ang's early life, except that he was nominated as a ''[[xiaolian]]'' (civil service candidate) upon reaching the age of adulthood (around 19 years old).<ref>(<U+8C50><U+610D><U+738B><U+6602><U+5B57><U+5B50><U+8129><U+3002><U+5F31><U+51A0><U+8209><U+5B5D><U+5EC9><U+3002>) Chen Shou.

Zhang Xiu surrendered initially, but later launched a surprise attack on Cao Cao, catching the latter completely off guard. Cao Cao was injured in the right arm by a stray arrow during the battle while his horse, Jueying (<U+7D55><U+5F71>), had been hit in the neck and leg.<ref>(<U+9B4F><U+66F8><U+66F0><U+FF1A><U+516C><U+6240><U+4E58><U+99AC><U+540D><U+7D55><U+5F71><U+FF0C><U+70BA><U+6D41><U+77E2><U+6240><U+4E2D><U+FF0C><U+50B7><U+9830><U+53CA><U+8DB3><U+FF0C><U+5E76><U+4E2D><U+516C><U+53F3><U+81C2><U+3002>) Annotations from the ''Wei Shu'' (<U+9B4F><U+66F8>) to Chen Shou's ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', Volume 5, Biography of Lady Bian.</ref> Cao Ang could not ride, so he offered his own steed to his father, who managed to escape from Wancheng.

In 221, after [[Cao Pi]] (another of Cao Cao's sons) ended the Han Dynasty and established the state of [[Cao Wei]] (which marked the start of the [[Three Kingdoms]] period), he granted Cao Ang the posthumous title of "Duke Dao of Feng" (<U+8C50><U+60BC><U+516C>). Three years later, Cao Ang was posthumously elevated to the status of a prince, so his posthumous title became "Prince Dao of Feng" (<U+8C50><U+60BC><U+738B>). In 229, during the reign of Cao Pi's son [[Cao Rui]], Cao Ang's posthumous title was changed to "Prince Min of Feng" (<U+8C50><U+610D><U+738B>).<ref>(<U+9EC3><U+521D><U+4E8C><U+5E74><U+8FFD><U+5C01><U+FF0C><U+8B1A><U+66F0><U+8C50><U+60BC><U+516C><U+3002> ... <U+4E94><U+5E74><U+FF0C><U+8FFD><U+52A0><U+6602><U+865F><U+66F0><U+8C50><U+60BC><U+738B><U+3002><U+592A><U+548C><U+4E09><U+5E74><U+6539><U+6602><U+8B1A><U+66F0><U+610D><U+738B><U+3002>) Chen Shou. ''Records of the Three Kingdoms'', Volume 20, Biography of Cao Ang.</ref>

==Succession==
Cao Ang had no son to succeed him when he died. However, in 222, Cao Wan (<U+66F9><U+742C>), a son of Cao Ang's half-brother Cao Jun (<U+66F9><U+5747>), was designated as Cao Ang's heir and was enfeoffed as a "Zhongdu Duke" (<U+4E2D><U+90FD><U+516C>). Later that year, Cao Wan was reassigned as a "Zhangzi Duke" (<U+9577><U+5B50><U+516C>). In 254, during the reign of [[Cao Fang]], Cao Wan was promoted to "Prince of Feng" (<U+8C50><U+738B>) and given the princedom "Feng", per Cao Ang's posthumous title. The number of taxable households in his princedom increased through the reigns of [[Cao Mao]] and [[Cao Huan]] until it reached 2,700. After Cao Wan died, he was posthumously honoured as "Prince Gong of Feng" (<U+8C50><U+606D><U+738B>) and was succeeded by his son Cao Lian (<U+66F9><U+5EC9>).<ref>(<U+4E09><U+5E74><U+FF0C><U+4EE5><U+6A0A><U+5B89><U+516C><U+5747><U+5B50><U+742C><U+5949><U+6602><U+5F8C><U+FF0C><U+5C01><U+4E2D><U+90FD><U+516C><U+3002><U+5176><U+5E74><U+5F99><U+5C01><U+9577><U+5B50><U+516C><U+3002> ... <U+5609><U+5E73><U+516D><U+5E74><U+FF0C><U+4EE5><U+742C><U+8972><U+6602><U+7235><U+70BA><U+8C50><U+738B><U+3002><U+6B63><U+5143><U+3001><U+666F><U+5143><U+4E2D><U+FF0C><U+7D2F><U+589E><U+9091><U+FF0C><U+5E76><U+524D><U+4E8C><U+5343><U+4E03><U+767E><U+6236><U+3002><U+742C><U+85A8><U+FF0C><U+8B1A><U+66F0><U+606D><U+738B><U+3002><U+5B50><U+5EC9><U+55E3><U+3002>) Chen Shou.
