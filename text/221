'''Rushcliffe''' is a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]]{{#tag:ref|A [[county constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}} represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 1970 by [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]], a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]].{{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}

==History==
The constituency was formed by the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] (for first use during the election that year). 

Since 1950 it has been a [[safe seat]] for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] whose members have held it without [[marginal seat|marginal majorities]] except for a four-year period when it was held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] from 1966 coinciding with the [[First Wilson Ministry]]. Unlike other constituencies nearby, such as [[Broxtowe (UK Parliament constituency)|Broxtowe]] and [[Gedling (UK Parliament constituency)|Gedling]], which were previously held by the Conservatives, they retained Rushcliffe in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 New Labour landslide]]. This was at the time attributed in part to its more rural nature, but also to the personal popularity of the incumbent MP, Conservative [[Kenneth Clarke]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Boundaries==
The constituency covers the south of [[Nottinghamshire]]. Its boundaries match those of the borough of [[Rushcliffe]], typically to the north by the [[River Trent]] and to the south by the county border.

===Boundary review===
Following their review of parliamentary representation in [[Nottinghamshire]], the [[Boundary Commission for England|Boundary Commission]]'s report approved by Parliament led to minor modifications to the existing constituency{{#tag:ref|The area around Bingham will became part of the [[Newark (UK Parliament constituency)|Newark]].|group= n}} for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] onwards. 

The seat has [[electoral ward]]s:
*Abbey, Compton Acres, Cotgrave, Edwalton Village, Gamston, Gotham, Keyworth North, Keyworth South, Lady Bay, Leake, Lutterell, Manvers, Melton, Musters, Nevile, Ruddington, Soar Valley, Stanford, Tollerton, Trent, Trent Bridge, Wiverton, and Wolds ''in the borough of [[Rushcliffe]]''

==Constituency profile==
The main town in the constituency is [[West Bridgford]], which is part of the [[Greater Nottingham]] urban area, and includes the [[Trent Bridge]] [[cricket]] ground and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.]]. The remainder of the constituency is predominantly rural, although includes the town of [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]] and villages of [[Cotgrave]], [[East Bridgford]], [[East Leake]], [[Sutton Bonington]], [[Keyworth]], [[Radcliffe on Trent]] and [[Ruddington]].

The constituency consists of Census Output Areas of one local government district with a working population whose income is close to the national average and has lower than average reliance upon [[social housing]].<ref>[http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk 2001 Census]</ref>  At the end of 2012 the unemployment rate in the constituency stood as 1.9% of the population claiming jobseekers allowance, compared to the regional average of 3.5%.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/nov/17/unemployment-and-employment-statistics-economics Unemployment claimants by constituency] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref> The borough contributing to the bulk of the seat has a low 15.1% of its population without a car, 16.4% of the population without qualifications and a very high 39.0% with level 4 qualifications or above.  In terms of tenure a high 76.7% of homes are owned outright or on a mortgage as at the 2011 census across the district.<ref>[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html 2011 census interactive maps]</ref>

==Members of Parliament==
;Kenneth Clarke
Since 1970, Rushcliffe's [[Member of Parliament]] has been one of Britain's prominent political figures, [[Kenneth Clarke]] of the Conservative Party.

Clarke was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1993 to 1997, ran to be party leader during opposition under the [[Blair Ministry]], then became Shadow Secretary of State for Business from 2009 to 2010 and then took ''[[de facto]]'' joined role of Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor from 2010 as the Lord Chancellor lost in the previous administration the requirement to be a leading judge and sit in the judiciary's highest court as well as a conventionally apolitical role in the House of Lords, in which the holder no longer sits.{{#tag:ref|Commentators questioned [[Lord Falconer]] its first revised holder whether the title should be abolished.|group= n}}
