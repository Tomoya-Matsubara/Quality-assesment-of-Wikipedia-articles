'''Jonathan Albaladejo''' (born [[October 30]], [[1982]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]]) is a [[Major League Baseball]] [[relief pitcher]] who currently plays for the [[New York Yankees]]. He is on the 60-day [[disabled list]] with a sprained right elbow ligament.

==Career==
Albaladejo was selected by the [[San Francisco Giants]] in the 34th round (1021st overall) of the 2000 amateur entry draft, but didn't sign.  The following year he was selected by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the 19th round (564th overall), and signed on [[June 6]], [[2001]].

He spent a number of years in the minors in the Pirates system as a starting pitcher, and then in 2005 was converted to a reliever.

On [[May 3]], [[2007]] he was signed to a minor league contract by the [[Washington Nationals]], and played most of the season at AA Harrisburg, compiling a 4.17 [[earned run average]] in 21 appearances.  He moved up to AAA Columbus and finished the season extremely well, posting an ERA of 0.78 in 14 appearances.  When rosters expanded in September, the Nationals, then leading the league in innings pitched by relievers, brought him up.

On [[September 4]], [[2007]], Albaladejo made an auspicious debut.  In the top of the third inning, in a game against the Florida Marlins, [[Tim Redding]] was injured by a batted ball and needed to be replaced.  Albaladejo entered the game with two men on and one out, and allowed a ground ball (where an inherited runner scored) and a pop up.  In the fourth inning, Albaladejo struck out the side, and then was relieved<ref>[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/WAS/WAS200709050.shtml September 5, 2007 Florida Marlins at Washington Nationals Box Score and Play by Play - Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

During the 2007-08 offseason, Albaladejo pitched for the [[Tiburones de La Guaira]] in the [[Venezuelan Professional Baseball League]].

He made the Yankees' opening day roster, but would only pitch in 9 games in the 2008 season because of an elbow injury suffered on May 9, 2008.
