With this line-up the group recorded their first two studio albums (1983's ''[[Melissa (Mercyful Fate album)|Melissa]]'' and 1984's ''[[Don't Break the Oath]]''), until 1985 when the band broke-up due to musical differences. In 1993, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited to record the album ''[[In the Shadows (album)|In the Shadows]]'', which was released the same year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Since 1999, Mercyful Fate have been on hiatus, but have reunited on occasion during the 2000s.
