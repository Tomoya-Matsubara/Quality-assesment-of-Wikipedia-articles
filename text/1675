'''''Night Fishing''''' (stylized as '''''NIGHT FISHING''''') is the second [[studio album]] by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] band [[Sakanaction]]. It was released on January 23, 2008 through [[Victor Entertainment]]'s BabeStar Label.<ref name="Tower">{{cite web | url=http://tower.jp/item/2355727/NIGHT-FISHING | title=<U+3010>CD<U+3011>NIGHT FISHING | language=Japanese | accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> The album was the band's second and final album to be recorded in their native Hokkaido. It primarily featured music written by vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi since the release of their debut album ''[[Go to the Future]]'' (2007), and was their first album to be purposely conceived of as an album.

The album was preceded by the digital singles "Word", "Sample" and "Night Fishing Is Good" in December 2007. Out of these, "Sample" was chosen as the main promotional track for the album, receiving high radio play in Hokkaido. ''Go to the Future'' was more commercially successful than ''Go to the Future'', reaching number 53 on the [[Oricon]] singles chart. Critically, the band was praised for their new direction on ''Night Fishing'', with critics praising the album's word-play, melodies and arrangements.

In 2009, the album was made available globally as a digital download, alongside the band's debut and third albums ''Go to the Future'' (2007) and ''[[Shin-shiro (album)|Shin-shiro]]'' (2009). In 2015, the album was reissued on CD, [[LP record]] and [[Lossless compression|lossless]] digital formats.

== Background and development ==

Sakanaction was first formed in 2005 in [[Sapporo]], [[Hokkaido]]. The band gained notoriety in Hokkaido after winning the audition to perform as a newcomer artist at the [[Rising Sun Rock Festival]] in [[Otaru, Hokkaido|Otaru]] in August 2006, and after demos of their songs "Mikazuki Sunset" and "Shiranami Top Water" performed well on College Radio Japan Sapporo.<ref name="OriconRadio">{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/44829/full/ | title=<U+5317><U+6D77><U+9053><U+304B><U+3089><U+5168><U+56FD><U+533A><U+3078>?<U+65B0><U+7A2E><U+30D0><U+30F3><U+30C9><U+201C><U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+201D> | language=Japanese |publisher=Oricon |date=May 22, 2007 | accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> The band were signed to major label [[Victor Entertainment]], and released their debut album ''[[Go to the Future]]'' on May 7, 2007, through Victor's BabeStar Label.

== Writing and production ==
=== Album creation ===
Due to the response to the band's debut album ''Go to the Future'', Sakanaction's [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] team pushed them to quickly follow this up with a second album.<ref name="RockingOn">{{cite web | url=http://ro69.jp/feat/sakanaction_201109?p=2 | title=<U+7279><U+96C6><U+3000><U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3> | language=Japanese |author=Shinji Hyogo |publisher=Rockin' On Japan |year=2011 | accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> Sakanaction felt extremely pressured while creating the album, especially by Sakanaction's Victor Entertainment musical director.<ref name="HMV1st">{{cite web | url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/en/news/article/802050129 | title=<U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3> <U+5C71><U+53E3><U+4E00><U+90CE><U+300E>NIGHT FISHING<U+300F><U+5168><U+66F2><U+89E3><U+8AAC><U+FF01><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC> | language=Japanese |publisher=HMV.co.jp |author=Takehiko Hosaka |date=February 8, 2008 | accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name="RockingOn"/> The song "Word" was inspired by this pressure, and in place of the lyric {{nihongo|''yoru ga bokura o tameshiteru na''|<U+591C><U+304C><U+50D5><U+3089><U+3092><U+8A66><U+3057><U+3066><U+308B><U+306A>||"the night is testing us"}} found on the final cut, in the original Yamaguchi had used the lyric {{nihongo|''kimi ga bokura o tameshiteru na''|<U+541B><U+304C><U+50D5><U+3089><U+3092><U+8A66><U+3057><U+3066><U+308B><U+306A>||"you are testing us"}}, in reference to their director and Victor.<ref name="HMV-Word">{{cite web | url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/en/news/article/802050130 | title=<U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3> <U+5C71><U+53E3><U+4E00><U+90CE><U+300E>NIGHT FISHING<U+300F><U+5168><U+66F2><U+89E3><U+8AAC><U+FF01><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+300C><U+30EF><U+30FC><U+30C9><U+300D> | language=Japanese |publisher=HMV.co.jp |author=Takehiko Hosaka |date=February 8, 2008 | accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>

The majority of the songs present on the album were written specifically for it. The band members felt like ''Night Fishing'' was their first release that they had made together as a five-member band, as opposed to ''Go to the Future'', which Yamaguchi described as feeling like a "business card" due to the inclusion of mostly old material.<ref name="SapporoLife">{{cite web | url=http://www.sapporolife.com/entertainment/interview/sakanaction/index.asp | title=Artist Interview vol.018 <U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3> | language=Japanese |publisher=Sapporo Life |year=2008 | accessdate=February 21, 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080208120012/http://www.sapporolife.com/entertainment/interview/sakanaction/index.asp |archivedate=February 17, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Eonet">{{cite web | url=http://eonet.jp/music/interview/index_080307.html | title=<U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+3000><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC> | language=Japanese |publisher=K-Opticom Corporation |date=March 7, 2008 | accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The material for the album was created based on the response and criticism for their debut album, and the members realization that they should not be frightened to make bold changes.<ref name="Eonet"/><ref name="Shift">{{cite web | url=http://www.shift.jp.org/ja/archives/2008/01/sakanaction.html | title=<U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3> <U+97F3><U+697D><U+306F><U+30A2><U+30FC><U+30C8><U+3002>|author=Madoka Suzuki |publisher=Shift Japan |year=2008 | accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> However, several songs were already written beforehand: "Sample" was originally a song released by Yamaguchi's high school band Dutchman 2002, and "Amsfish" was a song written during Sakanaction's early days in 2005 that did not make the album cut of ''Go to the Future'', because Yamaguchi felt that the song did not fit well on their debut release.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dutchman.jp/music/index.html | title=Discography | language=Japanese |publisher=Ichiro Yamaguchi | accessdate=February 17, 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041211230053/http://dutchman.jp/music/index.html |archivedate=December 11, 2004}}</ref><ref name="HMVAms"/> The band attempted to make a more commercial sound compared to ''Go to the Future'', and attempted to strike a balance between including underground, [[Minimal music|minimal]] electronic music and "high entertainment" popular music.<ref name="Eonet"/> The band did not want to remove the feeling of fun from their music, so added [[progressive rock]] aspects as well as sudden choral singing, and further expanded their sound by incorporating elements of [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[Folk music|folk]] music.<ref name="Shift"/><ref name="HMV1st"/> After performing their first Japanese tour in 2008, Sakanaction put more consideration into chosing arrangements that would work better at live concerts.<ref name="RockingOn"/>

The album was created at a point where each of the band members wanted to put more of their own personalities into the music of Sakanaction, which led to ''Night Fishing'' becoming their most fought-over album.<ref name="SapporoLife"/><ref name="RockingOn"/> Sakanaction also had difficulty between themselves and their record label over deciding which song should have been the leading song.

Lyrically, Yamaguchi worked around a "night" theme, and was inspired by creating film-like imagery for each song.<ref name="Eonet"/> Yamaguchi wanted to compile lyrics featuring introspective feelings of worry and sadness that people primarily felt at night.<ref name="Shift"/> Yamaguchi was further inspired to write more autobiographically, creating a documentary-like non-fiction work.<ref name="SapporoLife"/> He was inspired to create lyrics closer to the style of [[haiku]] than standard pop lyricisim, in order to express many things with as few phrases as possible.<ref name="Shift"/>

Several plans for the album did not come into being. Originally the band had planned for "Ame wa Kimagure" to be the leading song on the album, but after producing the song, Yamaguchi felt that the song's arrangement was too stylish and not easily accessible.<ref name="HMV-Amewa"/> The band had wanted to shoot a video for "Atarashii Sekai" on location in [[Kyoto]], however they had to abandon plans for this.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/>

=== Song inspiration and production ===
[[File:QueenPerforming1977-Brighter.jpg|thumb|The arrangement for the song "Night Fishing Is Good" was inspired by English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]].]]

Despite "Word" being inspired by the pressure by the band's musical director, it was strongly influenced by the album's night theme. Yamaguchi created the image of walking next to a river with a girl as the basis for the song, and wanted to create a song that would make a person cry if they heard it on a winter's night.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/><ref name="HMV-Word"/> Initially he struggled to actualize this, but managed to become inspired after creating the lyric ''yoru ga bokura o tameshiteru na''.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/> When the song was first performed in concert, it originally was given the temporary title {{nihongo|"Techno Word"|<U+30C6><U+30AF><U+30CE><U+30EF><U+30FC><U+30C9>|Tekuno W<U+0101>do}}, and was written as a song to give to former [[Judy and Mary]] vocalist [[Yuki (singer)|Yuki]], however plans did not come to fruition.<ref name="Sanakalocks-rerelease">{{cite web | url=http://www.tfm.co.jp/lock/sakana/index.php?blogid=4&archive=2015-2-12 | title=<U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+521D><U+671F>3<U+4F5C><U+54C1><U+306E><U+518D><U+767A><U+3001><U+30A2><U+30CA><U+30ED><U+30B0><U+76E4><U+30EA><U+30EA><U+30FC><U+30B9> | language=Japanese |author=Ichiro Yamaguchi |publisher=Tokyo FM |date=February 12, 2015 | accessdate=February 24, 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150224090502/http://www.tfm.co.jp/lock/sakana/index.php?blogid=4&archive=2015-2-12 |archivedate=February 24, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/kemurinokuni/47632222.html | title=<U+51E1><U+4EBA><U+3067><U+3054><U+3056><U+3044><U+307E><U+3059><U+3002> | language=Japanese |publisher=Ichiro Yamaguchi |date=June 14, 2007 | accessdate=February 17, 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150217041615/http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/kemurinokuni/47632222.html |archivedate=February 17, 2015}}</ref>

The song "Sample" had many different arrangements initially. As they had not intended for the song to becoming the leading promotional track, they had decided to use an arrangement with strong synthesizer sounds, instead of a more easy to understand, commercial sound.<ref name="

For the song "Night Fishing Is Good", Yamaguchi wanted to create a song that mimicked the emotions of fishing: initially deep in meditative thought that is suddenly broken when a fish gets hooked, and finally experiencing joy at catching the fish.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/><ref name="Eonet"/> Guitarist Motoharu Iwadera was the member who spent the most time contributing to the production of the song, and the band tried to have as much fun as possible with the arrangement.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/><ref name="HMV1st"/> Yamaguchi quickly wrote the song after reading a review in ''Musica'' of [[Clammbon]]'s album ''Musical'' (2007). He had wanted to make a song inspired by [[Musical theatre|musicals]] and [[classical music]], however felt that Clammbon might have beaten him to the punch.<ref name="HMV-NFIG"/> "Night Fishing Is Good" was one of several Sakanaction songs where he created the music and lyrics simultaneously; it was only later that part of the song's title was chosen to become the album's title.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/><ref name="HMV-Amewa"/> The other members of Sakanaction were hesitant about the song first, after hearing how complex it was when Yamaguchi performed it solo on guitar during studio demo sessions, and suggested that they split it into two songs.<ref name="HMV-NFIG"/> Part way through the song's recording, Yamaguchi was suddenly inspired to make the song similar to music of English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], which pianist Okazaki responded well to. Iwadera added Queen-style guitar riffs to the song, and the group decided to add chorus work in the style of Queen.<ref name="HMV-NFIG"/>

Despite the album's track order not being decided until the very end, Yamaguchi had from the start thought that "Ame wa Kimagure", "Malaysia 32" and "Uneri" should be in that order.<ref name="HMV-Amewa"/> After plans for "Ame wa Kimagure" to become the leading song were scrapped, Yamaguchi decided to elaborate on the "oriental" feel of the song.<ref name="HMV-Amewa"/> "Malaysia 32" is the band's first instrumental song, and was based on a synthesizer riff made by Iwadera which was then completed with ideas from everyone in the band.<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/><ref name="HMV-Malaysia">{{cite web | url=http://www.hmv.co.jp/en/news/article/802050134 | title=<U+30B5><U+30AB><U+30CA><U+30AF><U+30B7><U+30E7><U+30F3> <U+5C71><U+53E3><U+4E00><U+90CE><U+300E>NIGHT FISHING<U+300F><U+5168><U+66F2><U+89E3><U+8AAC><U+FF01><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+30BF><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30FC><U+300C><U+30DE><U+30EC><U+30FC><U+30B7><U+30A2><U+FF13><U+FF12><U+300D> | language=Japanese |publisher=HMV.co.jp |author=Takehiko Hosaka |date=February 8, 2008 | accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The song was called "Malaysia" because of how at one point they added a vocal melody that sounded like the name of the city [[Kuala Lumpur]].<ref name="HMV-Malaysia"/> The number 32 in the title is a reference to the fact that the song is based on a synthesizer loop of 32 [[Bar (music)|bars]].<ref name="SpecialSiteNightFishing"/> Originally "Uneri" had been envisioned as a rock song, but the band decided against this after creating "Night Fishing Is Good". The band's musical director suggested that they make the song acoustically instead, which led to the final studio arrangement of "Uneri".<ref name="HMV-Uneri"/>
