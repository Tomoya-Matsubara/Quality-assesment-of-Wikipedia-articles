{{nihongo|'''Mount Kumotori'''|<U+96F2><U+53D6><U+5C71>|Kumotoriyama}} stands at the boundary of [[Tokyo]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], and [[Yamanashi Prefecture]]s on the island of [[Honsh<U+016B>]], [[Japan]]. With an elevation of {{convert|2017|m|ft|0}}, its summit is the highest point in Tokyo. It separates the [[Okutama Mountains]] and the [[Okuchichibu Mountains]]. While it marks the end of the [[Ishione]] (<U+77F3><U+5C3E><U+6839>) mountain ridge that begins near the JR [[Okutama Station]], the highest mountain ridge in Tokyo, its remote location amongst a group of mountains from both mountain ranges makes access difficult.

Kumotori-san features an "emergency" hut sometimes used by hikers as overnight shelter. Hikers not used to the altitude (if coming from Tokyo) may prefer overnighting at a lower elevation. The top of Kumotori-san, in good weather, offers a splendid view of [[Fuji-san]].

The prominence of the mountain in the region resulted in its summit being established as a fixed first-class [[triangulation point]]. As the triangulation point was established in December 1882, this was also one of the earliest ones established in Japan.

Kumotori is one of the [[List of the 100 famous mountains in Japan|100 Famous Mountains of Japan]].
