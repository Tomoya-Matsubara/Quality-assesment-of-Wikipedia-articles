'''LeBron Raymone James''' ({{IPA-en|l<U+0259><U+02C8>br<U+0252>n|pron}}; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Nicknamed "King James", he was a three-time "[[Ohio Mr. Basketball|Mr. Basketball]]" of [[Ohio]] in high school, and was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar while a sophomore at [[St. Vincent<U+2013>St. Mary High School]]. At just 18, he was selected with the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|number one pick]] in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] by the Cavaliers and signed a [[United States dollar|US$]]90 million shoe contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] before his professional debut. Listed as a [[small forward]], James has set numerous [[Career achievements of LeBron James#Youngest player records|youngest player records]] since joining the league. He was named the NBA [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] in [[2003-04 NBA season|2003<U+2013>04]], [[NBA Most Valuable Player]] in [[2008-09 NBA season|2008<U+2013>09]] and [[2009-10 NBA season|2009<U+2013>10]], and has been both [[All-NBA]] and an [[All-Star]] every season since 2005.

The focal point of the Cleveland offense, James has led the team to consecutive [[NBA Playoffs|playoff]] appearances from [[2006 NBA Playoffs|2006]] through [[2010 NBA Playoffs|2010]]. In [[2007 NBA Playoffs|2007]], the Cavaliers advanced to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Conference Finals]] for the first time since 1992 and to the [[2007 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the first time in franchise history. James has been a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA national team]], winning a [[bronze medal]] at the [[Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] and [[gold medal|gold]] at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympics]].

== High school ==
James was born on December 30, 1984 in [[Akron, Ohio]], to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria.  His biological father, Anthony McClelland, was an ex-con who left Gloria to be a single mother.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/James/James_bio.html |title=LeBron James Biography |work=jockbio.com |accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>  James attended [[St. Vincent<U+2013>St. Mary High School]] in Akron, where he became a starter during his [[ninth grade|freshman year]] for the Fighting Irish. He averaged 21 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 6.2 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and led the team to a 23<U+2013>1 record, en route to the Division III state title. [[Keith Dambrot]], now head coach at the [[University of Akron]], was the head coach at St. Vincent<U+2013>St. Mary. Coach Dambrot started working with James doing $1 clinics at a local recreation center.<ref name="nbabio"/> In his [[Tenth grade|sophomore year]], James averaged 25.2 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.8 [[assist (basketball)|assists]] and 3.8 [[steal (basketball)|steals]].<ref name="nbabio"/> He led the team to a 26<U+2013>1 record and a Division III state title for the second straight season.<ref name="nbahigh"/> He was the first sophomore to be named Ohio's "Mr. Basketball" and became the first sophomore ever selected to the ''[[USA Today]]'' All-USA First Team.<ref name="nbahigh">{{Cite web |work=NBA.com |accessdate=May 26, 2007 |title=Prospect Profile: LeBron James |url=http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/JamesLeBron.html }}</ref>

In James' [[eleventh grade|junior year]] his stats improved again. He averaged 29.0 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 3.3 steals and was again named Mr. Basketball of Ohio.<ref name="nbahigh"/> He earned a spot on the All-USA First Team, and was named the 2001<U+2013>2002 boys' basketball [[Gatorade National Player of the Year]]. It was at this time that his nickname "King James" became a household staple in Ohio.

James appeared in ''[[SLAM Magazine]]'', which began his nationwide exposure. The St. Vincent<U+2013>St. Mary basketball team did not defend its state title when increased enrollment forced the team to move up to the more challenging Division II (Ohio high school basketball has four divisions based on annual enrollment figures) and lost to [[Roger Bacon High School]] ([[Cincinnati]]). James considered declaring for the [[2002 NBA Draft|2002 draft]] after the season ended by petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA's draft eligibility rules, which at the time required prospective players to have at least completed high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/books/09garner.html|title=An N.B.A. Giant and How He Grew|accessdate=2010-05-03|date=2009-09-09|page=C1|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Garner, Dwight}}</ref> The petition was unsuccessful, but it ensured him an unprecedented level of nation-wide attention as he entered his senior year. By then, James had already appeared on the covers of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]''. His popularity forced his team to move their practices from the school gym to the nearby [[James A. Rhodes Arena]] at the University of Akron. NBA stars such as [[Shaquille O'Neal]] attended the games, and a few of James' high school games were even televised nationally on [[ESPN2]] and regionally on [[pay-per-view]].

James's mother, Gloria James, created a firestorm of controversy when a bank took her son's future earning power into consideration, resulting in an approval of a loan used to buy an $80,000 [[Hummer H2]] for her son's 18th birthday. The event prompted an investigation by the [[Ohio High School Athletic Association]] (OHSAA). Under the OHSAA guidelines, no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance.<ref>{{Cite web |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=March 8, 2009 |date=January 27, 2003 |title=Prep star James can continue drive for state title |url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0127/1499490.html }}</ref> When James later accepted two throwback jerseys of [[Wes Unseld]] and [[Gale Sayers]] worth $845 from NEXT, an urban clothing store in [[Shaker Square]], in exchange for his posing for pictures to be displayed on the store's walls, OHSAA stripped him of his eligibility.<ref>{{Cite web |work=ESPN.com |date=January 31, 2003 |accessdate=March 8, 2009 |title=James ruled ineligible, plans to appeal decision |url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0131/1502001.html }}</ref> James appealed and a judge blocked the ruling, reducing the penalty to a two-game suspension and allowing him to play the remainder of the season. James's team was forced to forfeit one of their wins as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |work=ESPN.com |date=February 5, 2003 |accessdate=March 8, 2009 |title=James must miss one more regular-season game |url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0205/1504308.html }}</ref> That forfeit was the team's only official loss that season.

Despite the distractions, the Irish won a third state title, with James averaging 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists and 3.4 steals on the season.<ref name="nbahigh"/> James was named to the All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third time, and was selected as Mr. Basketball of Ohio for the third year in a row.<ref name="nbahigh"/> He earned MVP honors at the [[McDonald's All-American Game]], the [[EA Sports]] Roundball Classic, and the Jordan Capital Classic. Although it was a foregone conclusion, by participating in more than two high school all-star events, James officially lost his [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] eligibility. James finished his high school career with 2,657 points, 892 rebounds and 523 assists.<ref name="nbahigh"/>

Prior to Cleveland's first-round series versus the [[Washington Wizards]], Wizards guard [[Deshawn Stevenson]] said James was "overrated," prompting James to say that he would not return the insult, as that would be "almost like [[Jay-Z]] [responding to a negative comment] made by [[Soulja Boy Tell 'Em|Soulja Boy]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/12057426597770.xml&coll=2 |title=''Cleveland.com'' <U+2013> Cleveland Cavaliers Insider: LeBron James laughs off DeShawn Stevenson's comments (March 17, 2008) |publisher=Cleveland.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> In response, Soulja Boy himself made an appearance at Game 3 of the series (played in Washington) in support of the Wizards, and his music was played over the PA system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=280424027 |title=''ESPN.com'' <U+2013> Wizards outplay turnover-prone Cavs, get crucial Game 3 win (April 24, 2008) |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> James would later say that he meant no disrespect to Soulja Boy with his comment, and that his young son is a big fan of the rapper.

After a win on March 25 against the New Jersey Nets the Cleveland Cavaliers improved their record to 58<U+2013>13 exceeding their previous franchise best of 57<U+2013>25 set in the 1988<U+2013>89 and 1991<U+2013>92 NBA seasons.

In the playoffs, the Cavaliers swept the Detroit Pistons in the first round of the [[2009 NBA Playoffs]]. James averaged 32.0 points, 11.3 rebounds and 7.5 assists in the series and became just the third player in NBA history to average at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in a postseason series. At the end of the last game, in which he tallied 36 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists on 16<U+2013>17 free throw shooting, there were MVP chants for him in [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]].<ref>NBA.com, [http://www.nba.com/2009/news/features/john_schuhmann/04/26/cavs.pistons.game4/index.html Cavs complete sweep, turn Palace into their house].

On May 22, during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the [[Orlando Magic]]'s [[Hedo T<U+00FC>rko<U+011F>lu]] shot a 12-foot jumper to give the Magic a 2-point lead with 1 second left. Following a Cleveland timeout, Williams inbounded the ball to James, but heavy defense by T<U+00FC>rko<U+011F>lu denied James a chance at a tying layup. James then attempted and successfully made a three-point shot over T<U+00FC>rko<U+011F>lu, giving the Cavs a 96<U+2013>95 victory to tie the series 1<U+2013>1.<ref>{{Youtube|ahENQV1MwQI|LeBron Makes an Amazing Finish to Game 2}}</ref> Following losses in both games 3 and 4, James and the rest of the Cavs scored a victory in Game 5, making it 3<U+2013>2, to send the series back to Orlando. In Game 6, he scored a playoff low 25 points and the Cavaliers lost the series to Orlando.  James's postgame behavior incited some controversy when he left the game floor without shaking hands with his opponents. [[Jalen Rose]], a former NBA player and current [[ESPN]] commentator, said James' actions were "immature and ingracious." James later told reporters "It's hard for me to congratulate somebody after you just lose to them, I'm a winner. It's not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody beats you up, you're not going to congratulate them. ... I'm a competitor. That's what I do. It doesn't make sense for me to go over and shake somebody's hand."

=== 2009<U+2013>10 season ===

== Player profile ==
James has established himself as a legitimate [[triple-double]] threat and has averaged 27.8 points, 7.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds per game for his career in the regular season. <ref name="nbastat"/> As of the [[2009<U+2013>10 NBA season|2009<U+2013>10 season]], he has recorded 34 triple-doubles in his career,<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/sports/ci_7403036 Jazz: Swollen eye doesn't deter James from triple-double]. ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]''. Posted November 8, 2007.</ref> with 28 in the regular season and six in the postseason.<ref name="nbabio"/> On offense, James is known for using his size, strength and quickness to get past defenders, especially in transition, and for absorbing contact while finishing at the basket, with a variety of dunks and skillful lay-ups. In the [[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06 season]], he led the league in completed traditional three point plays.<ref name="nbabio"/> He is a solid rebounder who regularly ranks among the league leaders in rebounds for the small forward position.<ref>espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/statistics?stat=nbarebound&league=nba&split=0&sort=totreb&avg=pg&qual=true&season=2006&seasontype=2&pos=sf NBA Stats 2005<U+2013>2006 Rebounds], accessed May 12, 2007.</ref><ref>espn.com, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/statistics?stat=nbarebound&league=nba&split=0&sort=totreb&avg=pg&qual=true&season=2007&seasontype=2&pos=sf NBA Stats 2006<U+2013>2007 Rebounds], accessed May 12, 2007.</ref> James' most impressive skill however, is perhaps his ability to facilitate and create offense for his teammates, most notably out of double-team situations. He has a remarkable average of 7.0 assists per game for his career, unheard of for a player of his size. His skills have led to many comparisons to NBA legends [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Magic Johnson]], and [[Michael Jordan]].<ref name="comp">Dupree, David, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/playoffs/2006-04-20-james-cover_x.htm King James' next conquest]. Retrieved August 21, 2006.</ref> James was not named to the [[NBA All-Defensive Team]] until the [[2008<U+2013>09 NBA season|2008<U+2013>09 season]], when he finished second in voting for Defensive Player of the Year. LeBron is a potent wing defender, and amongst the elite help defenders in the NBA. His ability to make chase-down blocks, especially off opposing fastbreaks, has become a staple of his defensive game.

On March 1, 2010, James filed an application to the NBA to wear the #6 starting the 2010/2011 season. <ref>http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4958324</ref> He started a petition saying that no one should be allowed to wear the #23 in the NBA to honor Michael Jordan. It will be the first time James will not be wearing the #23 since his freshman year in high school, when a senior on his team wore it.
