'''World Extreme Cagefighting''' (WEC) is an [[United States|American]] [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial arts (MMA)]] promotion. It is the sister promotion to the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)]], both owned and produced by [[Zuffa]], with a focus on lighter weight classes. The WEC uses the same rules as its older and much larger sibling, but holds its matches in a smaller octagonal cage. 

== History== 
The organization was started in 2001 by Scott Adams and Reed Harris. Between 2001 and 2006, most of their events were held in Lemoore, California and aired on [[HDNet]].

In December 2006, Zuffa purchased the WEC. With the purchase, the WEC continues as a separate promotion with its own roster of fighters. Adams has been retained after the purchase as the organization's matchmaker. Harris and Adams were named co-General Managers and are both active in the new WEC.<ref name="mmaw">{{cite web

Zuffa made several changes to the promotion after the purchase. It discontinued its pentagonal cage for a modified version of the UFC's octagonal arena. The championships of fighters who were contracted UFC fighters were vacated. The promotion moved to focus on lighter weight classes, abandoning their [[Heavyweight (MMA)|heavyweight]] and [[Super Heavyweight (MMA)|super heavyweight]] divisions and championships, and retaining their [[Bantamweight (MMA)|bantamweight]] and [[Featherweight (MMA)|featherweight]] divisions<U+2014>two divisions not currently present in the UFC.<ref name="sher">{{cite web
