The '''Medal of Honor''' is the highest [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decoration]] awarded by the [[United States government]]. It is bestowed on a member of the [[United States armed forces]] who distinguishes himself "conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States."<ref name="regulations"/> Because of the nature of its criteria, the medal is often awarded [[posthumous recognition|posthumously]].

Members of all branches of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]] are eligible to receive the medal, and each service has a unique design with the exception of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard, which both use the Navy's medal. The Medal of Honor is often presented personally to the recipient or, in the case of posthumous awards, to next of kin, by the [[President of the United States]]. Due to its high status, the medal has special protection under U.S. law.<ref name="law">{{cite web |author=[[Office of the Law Revision Counsel]] |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sec_18_00000704----000-.html |title=18USC704(b) |work=US Code Collection |publisher=Cornell Law School |accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref>

The Medal of Honor is one of two military [[neck order]] awards issued by the United States Armed Forces, but is the sole neck order awarded to its members. The other is the Commander's Degree of the [[Legion of Merit]] which is only authorized for issue to foreign dignitaries.<ref name="neckorderLOM">{{cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/LOM1.html |title=Legion of Merit |work=Awards |publisher=Institute of Heraldry |accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref>

The medal is frequently, albeit incorrectly, called the '''Congressional Medal of Honor''', stemming from its award by the Department of Defense "in the name of Congress."<ref>Boatner, ''Military Customs and Traditions''. and Johnson, ''The Oxford Companion to American History''.</ref><ref name=CMOHS_name>The Congressional Medal of Honor Society is so named because that is the name it was given in an act of Congress signed into law by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Eisenhower]] on August 5, 1958 as [[Title 36 of the United States Code|Title 36]], Chapter 33 of the U.S. Code. (See {{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/society/history.htm |title = The Congressional Medal of Honor Society's History |work = Official Site |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-10-01}}.) The law authorizing the society has since been transferred to [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode36/usc_sup_01_36_06_II_08_B_10_405.html Title 36, Chapter 405 of the U.S. Code].</ref>

==Origin==
The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by [[George Washington]] on August 7, 1782, when he created the [[Badge of Military Merit]], designed to recognize "any singularly meritorious action." This decoration is America's first combat award and the second oldest American military decoration of any type, after the [[Fidelity Medallion]].<ref name="regulations"/><ref name="merit">{{cite web |author=U.S. Army Center of Military History |url=http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/reference/PurHrt.htm |title=The Badge Of Military Merit/The Purple Heart |accessdate=2006-07-23}}</ref>

Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the concept of a military award for individual gallantry by members of the U.S. armed forces had been established. In 1847, after the outbreak of the [[Mexican-American War]], a [[Certificate of Merit Medal|Certificate of Merit]] was established for soldiers who distinguished themselves in action. The certificate was later granted medal status as the [[Certificate of Merit Medal]].<ref name="meritmedal">{{cite web |author=Foxfall Medals |url=http://www.foxfall.com/fmd-army-com.htm |title=Certificate of Merit |accessdate=2006-07-25}}</ref>

Early in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a medal for individual valor was proposed by [[Iowa]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James W. Grimes]] to [[Winfield Scott]], the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]]. Scott did not approve the proposal, but the medal did come into use in the Navy. Public Resolution 82, containing a provision for a Navy Medal of Valor, was signed into law by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on December 21, 1861.<ref name="valorhonor">{{cite web |url = http://www.hq.usace.army.mil/history/Vignettes/Vignette_78.htm |title = Two Chief Engineers Were Medal of Honor Recipients? |work = Did You Know? |publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate =2006-07-29}}</ref> The medal was "to be bestowed upon such petty officers, seamen, landsmen, and Marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other seamanlike qualities during the present war."<ref name="pbs">{{cite web |url = http://www.pbs.org/weta/americanvalor/history/ |title = History of the Medal |publisher = Public Broadcasting System |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref> [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]] directed the [[Philadelphia Mint]] to design the new decoration.<ref name="typessecnav">{{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/medal/medal_types.htm |title = Types of the Medal of Honor: 1862 To Present |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society|accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref> Shortly afterward, a resolution of similar wording was introduced on behalf of the Army and was signed into law on July 12, 1862. This measure provided for awarding a Medal of Honor, as the Navy version also came to be called: "to such [[noncommissioned officer]]s and [[Private (rank)|privates]] as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action, and other soldier-like qualities, during the present [[insurrection]]."<ref name="valorhonor"/><ref name="pbs" />

==Appearance==
[[File:NavyMOH.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Early Navy versions of the Medal of Honor.]]
The Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance since its creation in 1862. The present Army medal consists of a gold star surrounded by a wreath, topped by an eagle on a bar inscribed with the word "Valor." The medal is attached by a hook to a light blue [[Moir<U+00E9> pattern|moir<U+00E9>]] [[silk]] neckband that is 1<sup>3</sup><U+2044><small>16</small>&nbsp;inches (30&nbsp;mm) in width and 21<U+00BE>&nbsp;inches (552&nbsp;mm) in length.<ref name="regulations"/><ref name="versions">{{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/medal.htm|title = The Medal |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-07-21}}</ref>

There is a version of the medal for each branch of the [[United States armed forces|U.S. armed forces]]: the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]. Since the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] is administratively a part of the [[Department of the Navy]], Marines receive the Navy medal. Before 1965, when the U.S. Air Force design was adopted, members of the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]], [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], and Air Force received the Army version of the medal.<ref name="typessecnav"/>

The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Medal of Honor, which was distinguished from the Navy medal in 1963, has never been awarded, partly because the U.S. Coast Guard is subsumed into the U.S. Navy in time of declared war. No design yet exists for it. Only one member of the Coast Guard has received a Medal of Honor, Signalman 1st Class [[Douglas Albert Munro|Douglas Munro]], who was awarded the Navy version for action during the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal|Battle of Guadalcanal]].<ref name="cmohsfaq">{{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/medal/medal_faq.htm |title = MOH FAQ |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-07-25}}</ref><ref name="cgmunro">{{cite web |url = http://www.uscg.mil/history/Munro%20Index.html |title = Douglas Albert Munro, USCG |publisher = US Coast Guard |accessdate = 2006-07-25}}</ref>

In the rare cases (19 thus far) where a service member has been awarded more than one Medal of Honor, current regulations specify that an appropriate award device be centered on the Medal of Honor ribbon and neck medal. To indicate multiple presentations of the Medal of Honor, the U.S. Army and Air Force bestow [[oak leaf cluster]]s, while the Navy Medal of Honor is worn with gold [[award star]]s.<ref name="double">{{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/recipients/double.htm |title = Double Recipients |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-07-25}}</ref>

A ribbon which is the same shade of light blue as the neckband, and includes five white stars, pointed upwards, in the shape of an "M" is worn for situations other than full dress uniform. When the ribbon is worn, it is placed alone, <U+00BC>&nbsp;inch (6&nbsp;mm) above the center of the other ribbons. For wear with civilian clothing, a rosette is issued instead of a miniature lapel pin (which usually shows the ribbon bar). The rosette is the same shade of blue as the neck ribbon and includes white stars. The ribbon and rosette are presented at the same time as the medal.<ref name="typessecnav"/>

===Flag===
On October 23, 2003, {{USPL|107|248}} was enacted, modifying {{UnitedStatesCode|36|903}}, authorizing a Medal of Honor flag to be presented to recipients of the decoration.<ref name="flaglaw">{{cite web |year = 23 Oct 2002 |url = http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/36C9.txt |title = Designation of the Medal of Honor Flag |publisher = US Code.gov |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

[[File:Medal of Honor flag.png|thumb|right|Medal of Honor Flag]]
The flag was based on a concept by retired [[U.S. Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] [[First sergeant|1SG]]. Bill Kendall of [[Jefferson, Iowa]],<ref name="Kendall">{{cite web |url = http://www4.army.mil/news/article.php?story=7244|title = Special Forces veteran's idea leads to new Medal of Honor flag |publisher = Army News Service|accessdate = 2006-07-24}}</ref> who designed a flag to honor Medal of Honor recipient Captain [[Darrell Lindsey]], a [[B-26 Marauder|B-26]] pilot killed in World War II who was also from Jefferson. Kendall's design of a light blue field emblazoned with thirteen white five-pointed stars was nearly identical to that of Sarah LeClerc's of the [[U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry|Institute of Heraldry]]. LeClerc's design, ultimately accepted as the official flag, does not include the words "Medal of Honor" and is fringed in gold. The color of the field and the 13 white stars, arranged in the form of a three bar [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]], consisting of two chevrons of 5 stars and one chevron of 3 stars,<ref name="regulations"/> replicate the Medal of Honor ribbon. The flag has no set proportions.<ref name="flag">{{cite web |url = http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Flags_Guidons/MedalOfHonorFlag.htm |title = Medal of Honor Flag |work = The Institute of Heraldry |publisher = US Army |accessdate = 2006-07-21}}</ref>

The first Medal of Honor recipient to receive the official flag was [[Paul R. Smith]]. The flag was cased and presented to his family along with his medal.<ref name="smithflag">{{cite web |last = Cramer |first = Eric W. |date = March 29, 2005 |url = http://www4.army.mil/ocpa/read.php?story_id_key=7085 |title = First Medal of Honor flag to be presented |work = Army News Service |publisher = US Army|accessdate = 2006-07-21}}</ref> A special ceremony presenting this flag to 60 Medal of Honor recipients was held onboard the {{USS|Constitution}} on September 30, 2006.<ref name="flagpresent">{{cite web |year = 2006 |url = http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=25834 |title = "Old Ironsides" Hosts Medal of Honor Recipients |work = Navy Newsstand |publisher = US Navy |accessdate = 2006-10-01}}</ref>

==Awarding the medal==
There are two distinct protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The first and most common is nomination by a service member in the [[chain of command]], followed by approval at each level of command. The other method is nomination by a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]] (generally at the request of a constituent) and approval by a special [[act of Congress]]. In either case, the Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of the Congress.

===Evolution of criteria===
Several months after President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law on December 21, 1861, a similar resolution for the Army was passed. Six [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers who [[Great Locomotive Chase|hijacked the ''General'']], a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[locomotive]] were the first recipients. Raid leader [[James J. Andrews]], a civilian [[hanged]] as a Union [[spy]], did not receive the medal. Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with saving the flag, not just for patriotic reasons, but because the flag was a primary means of battlefield communication. During the time of the Civil War, no other military award was authorized, and to many this explains why some seemingly less notable actions were recognized by the Medal of Honor during that war. The criteria for the award tightened after [[World War I]]. In the post-[[World War II]] era, many eligible recipients might instead have been awarded a [[Silver Star]], [[Navy Cross]] or similar award.

During the Civil War, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] promised a Medal of Honor to every man in the [[27th Maine Regiment|27th Regiment, Maine Infantry]] who extended his enlistment beyond the agreed upon date. Many stayed four days extra, and then were discharged. Due to confusion, Stanton awarded a Medal of Honor to all 864 men in the regiment.<ref name="27thMaine">{{cite web |last=Sterner |first=C. Douglas |year=2004 |url=http://www.homeofheroes.com/moh/corrections/purge_army.html |title = The Purge of 1917 |publisher = homeofheroes.com |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

In 1916, a board of five Army generals convened by law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded. The commission, led by [[Nelson Miles]], recommended that the Army rescind 911 medals. This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine, 29 who served as [[Abraham Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln's]] funeral guard, six civilians (including [[Mary Edwards Walker|Dr Mary Edwards Walker]], the only woman to have been awarded the medal), [[Buffalo Bill|Buffalo Bill Cody]], and 12 others whose awards were judged frivolous. Dr. Walker's medal was restored posthumously by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977.<ref name="27thMaine" /> Cody's award was restored in 1989.<ref name="restorations">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmohs.com/medal/medal_history.htm |title = The Medal's History |publisher = Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref>

Early in the 20th century, the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery. For instance, seven sailors aboard the [[USS Iowa (BB-4)|USS ''Iowa'']] received the medal when a [[boiler]] exploded on January 25, 1904. Aboard the [[USS Chicago (CA-14)|USS ''Chicago'']] in 1901, [[John Henry Helms]] received the medal for saving Ishi Tomizi, the ship's cook, from drowning. Even after World War I, [[Richard Byrd]] and [[Floyd Bennett]] received the medal for exploration of the [[North Pole]].<ref name="floyd">{{cite web |url = http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/bennettf.htm |title = Floyd Bennett |publisher = Arlington National Cemetery |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>
[[Thomas J. Ryan (admiral)|Thomas J. Ryan]] received it for saving a woman from the burning Grand Hotel in [[Yokohama]], Japan following the 1923 [[Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]].<ref name="ryan">{{cite web |url = http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/mohint5.htm |title = Medal of Honor Recipients, Interim Awards 1920<U+2013>1940 |publisher = Center for Military History |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

[[File:Tiffany Cross Medal of Honor.jpg|thumb|right|Tiffany Cross version of the Medal of Honor]]
Between 1919 and 1942, the Navy issued two separate versions of the Medal of Honor, one for non-combat bravery and the other for combat-related acts. Official accounts vary, but generally the non-combat Medal of Honor was known as the Tiffany Cross, after the company that manufactured the medal. The Tiffany Cross was first issued in 1919 but was rare and unpopular, partly because it was presented both for combat and noncombat events.<ref>{{cite book |title=Above and Beyond: The Aviation Medals of Honor |first=Barrett |last=Tillman |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2003 |pages=3}}</ref> As a result, in 1942, the United States Navy reverted to a single Medal of Honor, awarded only for heroism.<ref name="tiffany">{{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/medal/medal_types.htm |title = Types of the Medal of Honor: 1862 To Present |work = Navy Medal of Honor (1913) |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

Since the beginning of World War II, the medal has been awarded for extreme bravery beyond the call of duty while engaged in action against an enemy. Arising from these criteria, approximately 60% of the medals earned during and after World War II have been awarded posthumously.<ref name="mohstats">{{cite web |month = May | year = 2003 |url = http://www.army.mil/cmh/mohstats.htm |title = Medal of Honor Statistics |work = Center for Military History |publisher = US Army |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref> Capt.

===Controversies===
A 1993 study commissioned by the Army investigated racial discrimination in the awarding of medals.<ref name="African">{{cite web |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/mohb.html |title = WWII African American MOH recipients |work = Center for Military History |publisher = US Army |accessdate = 2006-07-20}}</ref> At the time, no Medals of Honor had been awarded to black soldiers who served in World War II. After an exhaustive review of files, the study recommended that several black [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] recipients be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded the medal to seven [[African American]] World War II veterans. Of these, only [[Vernon Baker]] was still alive.<ref name="African"/> A similar study of [[Asian American]]s in 1998 resulted in President [[Bill Clinton]] awarding 21 new Medals of Honor in 2000, including 20 to [[Japanese American]] members of the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], among them Senator [[Daniel Inouye]].<ref name="Asian"/> In 2005, President [[George W.

==Authority and privileges==
The U.S. Army Medal of Honor was first authorized by a joint resolution of Congress on July 12, 1862. The specific authorizing statute was {{UnitedStatesCode|10|3741}}, which states:

{{cquote|The President may award, and present in the name of Congress, a medal of honor of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who while a member of the Army, distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.<ref name="1998code">{{cite web |year = January 26, 1998 |url = http://www.washingtonwatchdog.org/documents/usc/ttl10/subttlB/ptII/ch357/sec3741.html |title = Sec. 3741.

[[File:Jimmie W. Monteith Jr. Gravemarker 03.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The grave of a recipient at the [[Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial]]]]

Later authorizations created similar medals for other branches of the service.

The Medal of Honor confers special privileges on its recipients. By law, recipients have several benefits:<ref name="benefits">{{cite web |url = http://www.tricare.osd.mil/medalofhonor/default.cfm |title = Medal of Honor Recipients |publisher = Tricare |accessdate = 2006-07-24}}</ref><ref name="benefits2">{{cite web |url = http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/navawards/blmoh.htm |title = Navy & Marine Corps Awards and Decorations: Medal of Honor |publisher = usmilitary.about.com |accessdate = July 24 |accessyear = 2006}}</ref><ref name="benefits3">{{cite web |url = http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/Rates/special1.htm |title = Special Benefits and Allowances Table |publisher = Dept. of Veterans Affairs |accessdate = 2006-07-24}}</ref>
*Each Medal of Honor recipient may have his or her name entered on the Medal of Honor Roll ({{UnitedStatesCode|38|1560}}). Each person whose name is placed on the Medal of Honor Roll is certified to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] as being entitled to receive the special [[pension]] of US$1,027 per month above and beyond any military pensions or other benefits for which they may be eligible. As of December 1, 2004, the pension is subject to cost-of-living increases.
[[File:James H Robinson grave.jpg|thumb|250px|Grave of a recipient at the [[Memphis National Cemetery]]]]
*Enlisted recipients of the Medal of Honor are entitled to a supplemental uniform allowance.
*Recipients receive special entitlements to air transportation under the provisions of DOD Regulation 4515.13-R.
*Special identification cards and commissary and exchange privileges are provided for Medal of Honor recipients and their eligible dependents.
*Fully-qualified children of recipients are eligible for admission to the [[List of United States military schools and academies|United States military academies]] without regard to the nomination and quota requirements.
*Recipients receive a 10% increase in retired pay under {{UnitedStatesCode|10|3991}}.
*Those awarded the medal after October 23, 2002 also receive a Medal of Honor Flag. The law also specifies that all 103 living prior recipients also receive the flag.({{UnitedStatesCode|14|505}}).
*As with all medals, retired personnel may wear the Medal of Honor on "appropriate" civilian clothing. Regulations also specify that recipients of the Medal of Honor are allowed to wear the uniform "at their pleasure" with standard restrictions on political, commercial, or extremist purposes; other former members of the armed forces may do so only at certain ceremonial occasions.<ref name="civilian">{{cite web |url = http://www.homeofheroes.com/moh/history/history_images.html |title = Ribbon and Rosette |The Medal of Honor: 1862 to Present |publisher = homeofheroes.com |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref><ref name="AR670">{{cite web |url = http://www.army.mil/symbols/Downloads/r670_1.pdf|format=PDF|title = Army Uniform Regulations AR 670-1 3 Feb 2005 Section 30-5 and 30-6 p.339 |Chapter 30-6 p.339 |publisher = Department of the Army |accessdate = 2006-07-24}}</ref>

Unofficial customs and courtesies:
*It is customary for all ranks to render a salute to a recipient, regardless of the recipient's rank.<ref>It is considered proper to render a salute to a Medal of Honor recipient when otherwise inappropriate, e.g. officer saluting enlisted and enlisted saluting enlisted, although it is not universally prescribed. For example, neither [http://www.apd.army.mil//pdffiles/r600_25.pdf Army Regulation 600-25] or [http://doni.daps.dla.mil/US%20Navy%20Regulations/Chapter%2012%20-%20Flags,%20Pennants,%20Honors,%20Ceremonies%20and%20Customs.pdf Navy Regulations Chapter 12] mention this exception. When rendering a salute in this circumstance, the superior often renders the salute to be simultaneous with the junior, as the salute is being rendered to the Medal itself, and not the recipient's rank.</ref>
*Recipients are greeted and saluted before non-recipients are greeted or saluted.

==Legal protection==
Until late 2006, the Medal of Honor was the only service decoration singled out in federal law to protect it from being imitated or privately sold. The [[Stolen Valor Act of 2005]], enacted December 20, 2006, extended federal protection to include false verbal, written, or physical claims to other military decorations, service medals, or military badges to which a person is not entitled.<ref name="s1998track">{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-1998 |title=S. 1998: Stolen Valor Act of 2005 |work=109th U.S. Congress (2005<U+2013>2006) |publisher=GovTrak.us |accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref><ref>18 U.S.C. 704</ref>
[[File:Moh2.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Medal of Honor on display]]
All Medals of Honor are issued in the original only, by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], to a recipient. Misuse of the medal, including unauthorized manufacture or wear, is punishable by a fine up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to one year pursuant to ({{uscsub|18|704|b}}). After the Army redesigned its medal in 1903, a [[patent]] was issued (United States Patent #D37,236) to legally prevent others from making the medal. When the patent expired, the Federal government enacted a law making it illegal to produce, wear, or distribute the Medal of Honor without proper authority.

HLI Lordship Industries Inc., a former Medal of Honor contractor, was fined in 1996 for selling 300 fake medals for US$75 each.<ref name="hli2">{{cite web |year = December 4, 1996 |url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/04/briefs/medal.html |title = Company fined for selling fake Medals of Honor |work = US News |publisher = CNN |accessdate = 2006-07-21}}</ref>

Also that year, Fort Lauderdale, Florida resident Jackie Stern was convicted of wearing a medal to which he was not entitled; instead of six months in jail, a federal judge sentenced him to serve one year's probation and to write a letter of apology to each of the then-living 171 actual recipients of the medal; the letter was also published in the local newspaper.<ref name="stern">{{cite web |year = December 4, 1996 |url = http://www.cnn.com/US/9612/04/medal.without.honor/ |title = Florida Man wears medal without Honor |work = US News |publisher = CNN |accessdate = 2006-09-30}}</ref>

In 2003, Edward Fedora and Gisela Fedora were charged with violating ({{uscsub|18|704|b}}) - Unlawful Sale of a Medal of Honor.

{{main|List of Medal of Honor recipients}}

In total, 3,465 medals have been awarded to 3,446 different people.<ref name="mohshistory">{{cite web |url = http://www.cmohs.org/society/history.htm |title = The Congressional Medal of Honor Society's History |work = Official Site |publisher = Congressional Medal of Honor Society |accessdate = 2006-10-01}}</ref><ref name="usmcmoh">{{cite web |url = http://www.usmc.mil/moh.nsf/ |title = Marines Awarded the Medal of Honor |publisher = US Marine Corps |accessdate = 2006-07-20}}</ref> Nineteen men received a second award: 14 of these received two separate medals for two separate actions, and five received both the Navy and the Army Medals of Honor for the same action. Since the beginning of World War II, 854 Medals of Honor have been awarded, 528 posthumously. In total, 618 had their medals presented posthumously.<ref name="mohstats"/>

The first Army Medal of Honor was awarded to Private [[Jacob Parrott]] during the American Civil War for his role in the [[Andrews Raid]]. The only female Medal of Honor recipient is [[Mary Edwards Walker]], a Civil War surgeon. Her medal was rescinded in 1917 along with many other non-combat awards, but it was restored by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977.<ref name="walker">{{cite web |url = http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/walk-mar.htm |title = Mary Edwards Walker |publisher = Women in History |accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref>

While current regulations, ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|6241}}), beginning in 1918, explicitly state that recipients must be serving in the U.S. Armed Forces at the time of performing a valorous act that warrants the award, exceptions have been made. For example, [[Charles Lindbergh]], while a reserve member of the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]], received his Medal of Honor as a civilian pilot. In addition, the Medal of Honor was presented to the [[The Unknown Warrior|British Unknown Warrior]] by [[John J. Pershing|General Pershing]] on October 17, 1921; later the [[Tomb of the Unknowns|U.S. Unknown Soldier]] was reciprocally awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], Britain's highest award for gallantry, on November 11, 1921. Apart from these few exceptions, Medals of Honor can only be awarded to members of the U.S. armed forces - although being a U.S. citizen is not a prerequisite. Sixty-one [[Canada|Canadians]] who were serving in the United States armed forces have been awarded the Medal of Honor, with a majority awarded for actions in the American Civil War. Since 1900, only four have been awarded to Canadians.<ref name="cbc">{{cite web |year = July 1, 2005 |url = http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2005/07/01/canadians-usmedal050701.html |title = Canada honours winners of top U.S. medal |publisher = CBC News|accessdate = 2006-07-20}}</ref> In the Vietnam War, [[Peter C.

== Post-Vietnam ==
For actions occurring since the withdrawal of US forces from Vietnam in 1973, the Medal of Honor has been awarded eight times, all of them posthumously. The first two were earned by [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] [[Delta Force]] snipers [[Sergeant First Class]] [[Randy Shughart]] and [[Master Sergeant]] [[Gary Gordon]], who defended downed [[UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopter pilot [[Chief Warrant Officer]] [[Michael Durant]] and his crew during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993.<ref name="Somalia">{{cite web |url = http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/mohsom.htm |title = Medal of Honor Recipients: Somalia |work = Center for Military History |publisher = US Army|accessdate = 2006-07-23}}</ref> Three others were awarded during the [[Iraq War]], to Army Sergeant First Class [[Paul Ray Smith]], Army Private First Class [[Ross A. McGinnis]], and Marine Corps [[Corporal#United States|Corporal]] [[Jason Dunham]]. In 2005, a posthumous Medal of Honor was awarded to Sergeant First Class Smith for actions in [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]; his medal was presented to his survivors. In April 2003, Smith organized the defense of a prisoner of war holding area which was attacked by a company-sized Iraqi force, personally manning a machine gun under enemy fire.<ref name="iraq1">{{cite web |url = http://www.army.mil/cmh-pg/mohiraq.htm |title = Medal of Honor Recipients: Iraq |publisher = Center for Military History|accessdate = 2006-11-10}}</ref> In 2007, [[President]] [[George W.

On October 22, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] presented the award to the family of [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] Lieutenant [[Michael P. Murphy]] for his actions in Afghanistan during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in 2005.

On March 3, 2008, President Bush presented the Medal of Honor posthumously to Master Sergeant [[Woodrow W. Keeble]] for his actions during the [[Korean War]]. His family had waged a long campaign for the medal after the recommendation was twice lost during the conflict. Master Sergeant Keeble, who died in 1982, was the first member of the [[Sioux]] [[List of Native American Tribal Entities|Nation]] to be awarded the medal.<ref>[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=49159 Korean War Hero Receives Posthumous Medal of Honor March 3, 2008]</ref> This was the 49th belated Medal of Honor award since 1979.<ref>''Medal of Honor recipients 1979-2007''.

On April 8, 2008, President Bush posthumously presented the Medal of Honor to the parents of Navy MA2 [[Michael A. Monsoor]] (SEAL), who had jumped onto a live [[grenade]] thrown by a [[Sunni]] [[insurgent]] in order to save the lives of two fellow SEALs who, unlike him, had no route to escape the blast.<ref name="LATimes">Perry, Tony, "Sailor Killed In Iraq Awarded Medal Of Honor", [[Los Angeles Times]], April 1, 2008, Pg. 1.</ref>

On June 2, 2008, President Bush posthumously presented the Medal of Honor to the parents of Army PFC [[Ross A. McGinnis]].
