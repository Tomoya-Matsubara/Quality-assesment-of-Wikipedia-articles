The '''Confederate Memorial''' (also referred to as the '''First Confederate Memorial''') is a [[memorial]] in [[Indian Mound Cemetery]] in [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]], [[West Virginia]]. The memorial commemorates residents of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] who died during the [[American Civil War]] fighting for the [[Confederate States of America]]. The memorial was sponsored by the Confederate Memorial Association, which formally dedicated the monument on September 26, 1867. It is thought to be the first memorial structure erected to memorialize the Confederate dead in the [[United States]]. Romney also claims to have undertaken the first public decoration of Confederate graves on June 1, 1866.

== Confederate Memorial Association ==
Early in the spring of 1866, a meeting took place at the [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]] residence of former Confederate Colonel [[Robert White (politician)|Robert White]] during which the idea to memorialize the men of [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] who had died fighting in the [[Military of the Confederate States of America]] was conceived.<ref name = "Maxwell1">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=692.}}</ref> Present at this engagement were White, his brother [[Christian Streit White]] and his brother's future wife Elizabeth "Bessie" Jane Schultze, and his sister Frances Ann White, who later married [[Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy]].<ref name = "Maxwell1"/> Following this meeting, interest in such a memorialization of the Confederate dead grew among the residents of Romney.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/> Later in the spring of 1866, a group of Hampshire County women held a public meeting and organized the Confederate Memorial Association to honor the men who had died fighting for the Confederacy<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Munske1">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=137.}}</ref><ref name = "FWP2">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=65.}}</ref> and to provide financial aid to their families.<ref name = "HH1">{{Citation | url = http://www.historichampshire.org/civilwar/confed.htm | title =The Confederate Memorial in Indian Mound Cemetery, Romney, W. Va. and The Confederate Memorial Association | work = HistoricHampshire.org | publisher = HistoricHampshire.org, Charles C. Hall | accessdate = November 22, 2013}}</ref> At this public meeting, the association appointed officers, adopted a constitution, and selected committees to arrange for the decoration of Confederate interments.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/>{{efn|name=officers}}

The populace of Hampshire County had been overwhelmingly pro-Confederate in its sympathies during the [[American Civil War]], but the county now lied within [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]] [[West Virginia]].<ref name = "Munske2">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=136.}}</ref> West Virginia's first [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]] Confederate veterans and partisans and forbade them from holding elected office.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Munske2"/> In spite of these impediments and risking the ire of Unionist authorities,<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/> members of the Confederate Memorial Association and their families marched through [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]] to [[Indian Mound Cemetery]] and formally decorated the [[gravestone]]s at the [[burial|interment]] sites of Confederate dead on June 1, 1866.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Munske2"/> Few Hampshire County residents participated in this first decoration of the Confederate graves fearing reproach from Federal authorities,<ref name = "Maxwell1"/> and others who had pledged to take part in the decoration later refused to do so for this reason.<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=693.}}</ref> 

This adornment in Indian Mound Cemetery is purportedly the first such public decoration of Confederate burials,<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/> although this claim is disputed by other cities in the [[Southern United States]].<ref name = "FWP2"/> It is thought that this decoration set a precedence that spread throughout the South during the [[Reconstruction Era]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/> Relatives and loved ones of the Union dead buried in Indian Mound Cemetery also began to follow this precedent by decorating the cemetery's Union headstones.<ref name = "Munske2"/>

== Fundraising ==
Following the first decoration of the graves in 1866, momentum began to build for the erection of a permanent [[monument]] to the Confederate dead at Indian Mound Cemetery.<ref name = "Munske1"/> The Confederate Memorial Association launched a fundraising initiative to raise money for the construction of the memorial, which consisted of a series of [[sewing circle]]s, bazaars, and [[fair]]s.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "FWP1">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=13.}}</ref> Further fundraising efforts were undertaken by Confederate veterans and the general public throughout Hampshire County, including [[entertainment]] shows and [[solicitation]] of funds.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/> In addition to raising funds for the construction of the memorial, the Confederate Memorial Association was also able to provide some of the money raised to the widows and children of the Confederate dead.<ref name = "Munske1"/> By October 15, 1866, the [[Gross (economics)|gross]] receipts returned to the association's treasury amounted to $1,170.91 [[United States dollar|USD]],<ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> of which the Confederate Memorial Association provided $421.58 USD to the Confederate widows and orphaned children.<ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Subsequent fundraising efforts and pubic exhibitions were undertaken until sufficient funds were raised in June 1867.<ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/>

== Design selection  ==
[[File:First_Confederate_Memorial_Romney_WV_2005_9_16_02.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The main inscription ''(pictured)'' etched into the fa<U+00E7>ade of the Confederate Memorial.]]
By June 6, 1867, the Confederate Memorial Association had raised the necessary funds and resolved to proceed with the selection a monument design and the designation of a contractor for its fabrication.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Munske2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Confederate veterans were also closely involved in the monument's design selection process<ref name = "Munske1"/> and citizens from across Hampshire County were called together to inform and select the memorial's design and inscription.<ref name = "FWP2"/> 

In July 1867, a committee of the Confederate Memorial Association narrowed the numerous proposals it had received for the memorial's inscription down to three finalists.<ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> The first proposed inscription spoke of Confederate soldiers as having "died in defense of what they believed to be right," while the second finalist stated "our sons and brothers, who fell as soldiers in the Confederate army."<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> The third proposal of these finalists was adopted by the committee, which read: "The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights."<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "FWP1"/>

== Construction ==
Once the design and inscription had been chosen, the association appointed committees to optate a contractor.<ref name = "FWP2"/> That summer, the Confederate Memorial Association awarded a contract to the Gaddes Brothers firm of [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] for the fabrication of a white [[marble]] monument.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> The memorial was designed, sculpted, and manufactured at a cost of $1,133.63 USD.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> According to [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] historian Mary Bell Foote, the words "Southern Rights" were omitted from the end of the memorial's inscription due to the "bitter" feelings in Baltimore following the American Civil War.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/> After the memorial's components were packaged for shipping to Romney, the words "Southern Rights" were secretly etched into marble before and were quickly boarded over and hurriedly shipped.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/>

The memorial's components was delivered to Indian Mound Cemetery on September 14, 1867,<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "FWP1"/> and it was erected at its present location by male volunteers in Romney.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/> Bob Fisher was paid $5.00 USD for raising the earthen mound around the monument's location, William Sheetz was paid $18.80 USD for building the memorial's foundation atop and the mound, and Sheetz was further paid $4.11 USD for boarding one of the Gaddes brothers at his residence during the monument's erection.<ref name = "HH1"/> Twelve days later on September 26, the Confederate Memorial was formally dedicated in a public ceremony.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/>{{efn|name=special}}

== Location and design ==
[[File:Indian Mound Cemetery Romney WV 2010 04 25 04.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The Confederate Memorial ''(pictured center right)'' is located atop a small mound in [[Indian Mound Cemetery]] just inside the cemetery's entrance.]]
The Confederate Memorial stands upon a raised mound ringed by five [[Buxus|boxwoods]] within the original section of Indian Mound Cemetery, not far from within the cemetery's entrance.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "FWP1"/> The memorial and its circular raised lawn are a centerpiece around which several family interment plots are located.<ref name = "Munske3">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=138.}}</ref> Also adjacent to the memorial's location is the burial ground where Confederate and Union dead were buried during the American Civil War.<ref name = "Munske3"/> 

The Confederate Memorial is made of white Italian [[marble]] in an [[obelisk]] and measures {{convert|4|sqft|m2|lk=in|sigfig=2}} at its base and {{convert|12|ft|m}} in [[height]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "B&O1">{{Citation| last =Riley  | first =Elihu S.  | author-link =| title =The First Confederate Monument | newspaper = Book of the Royal Blue | publication-place = [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] | volume = 10 | issue = | date = December 1906 | publisher =Passenger Department, [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] | page =17<U+2013>18 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-zQOAQAAIAAJ | accessdate = November 22, 2013}}</ref> The structure consists of two major stylized component blocks of white marble, topped by a sculpture of a cloth draped [[urn]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "B&O1"/> Carved into the fa<U+00E7>ade of the smaller top block of the memorial is a [[Relief|high relief]] that represents either Fame or an angel placing a [[laurel wreath]] upon the head of a dying soldier clasping his sword.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "B&O1"/> Below on the fa<U+00E7>ade of the larger block is etched the inscription: "The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights."<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "FWP1"/> The other three sides of the memorial contain the engraved names of 125 Hampshire County men who died for the Confederate cause.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Munske2"/><ref name = "FWP1"/> A number representing the total fallen Confederates was not included in the memorial due to remaining uncertainty at the time of the monument's construction.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/> The memorial's [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] block bears the date of its erection, "1867."<ref name = "B&O1"/>

=== Inscribed names ===
The Confederate Memorial contains the engraved names of 125 Hampshire County men who died for the Confederate cause.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "FWP2"/><ref name = "Munske2"/><ref name = "FWP1"/> These names consist of four captains, seven lieutenants (one of which was a [[chaplain]], three sergeants, and 119 privates.<ref name = "Maxwell2"/><ref name = "B&O1"/> Since the memorial's erection in 1867, several names of Hampshire County's Confederate dead were found to have been omitted from the memorial.<ref name = "FWP3">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=66.}}</ref> These names have been included in a Confederate "roll of honor" along with those names etched in the memorial and the names of Confederate veterans.<ref name = "FWP3"/> Each of these names is recited each Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day.<ref name = "Munske2"/><ref name = "FWP3"/> The following is the list of Confederate dead etched into the Confederate Memorial:<ref name = "Maxwell2"/>

== Restoration ==
In 1984, the Confederate Memorial underwent an extensive [[Architectural conservation|restoration]] to restore its original appearance.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> The monument had darkened due to [[weathering]] and other elements.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> The surfaces of the memorial were [[sanding|sanded]] and sealed for future protection.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> This restoration effort was funded through contributions from interested parties with a shared heritage and preexisting relationships with Indian Mound Cemetery and Confederate memorial endeavors.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> The names of these contributors were inscribed within the same treasurer's book used to record the memorial's inaugural contributions on June 6, 1866.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> The monument's restoration cost totaled $2,850 USD, far exceeding its original price to build.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/>

== Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day ==
The tradition of decorating the Confederate graves in Indian Mound Cemetery has continued annually since June 1, 1866<ref name = "Maxwell1"/>, and occurs on the first Saturday in June, which is known as Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day or June Decoration Day.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "Munske2"/> On this day, participants in the ceremony march down Main Street ([[U.S. Route 50]]) through Romney with [[American Civil War reenactment|American Civil War reenactors]] carrying [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flags]].<ref name = "Munske2"/> A handmade [[evergreen]] [[garland]] measuring {{convert|30|ft|m}} in length is suspended from the Confederate Memorial, along with evergreen [[wreaths]].<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske2"/> Flowers and Confederate flags are also placed at each of the Confederate headstones.<ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske3"/> The decorations are usually placed at the memorial and upon the Confederate gravestones by reenactors.<ref name = "Munske2"/> Throughout the existence of Hampshire County Confederate Memorial Day, renowned [[orator]]s have been invited to speak at this decoration ceremony.<ref name = "Munske3"/> In addition, a [[Roll of Honour|roll of honor]] is recited at the memorial, followed by a [[musket]] salute.<ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "Munske2"/> Descendants of the founding members of the Confederate Memorial Association continue to participate in these traditions at the Confederate Memorial and in Indian Mound Cemetery.<ref name = "Munske1"/>

== Significance ==
The construction of the Confederate Memorial marked the beginning of a post-war revitalization for Hampshire County following the American Civil War.<ref name = "FWP3"/> The memorial became a symbol of the county's restored confidence and embodied its capacity to engage in and complete concerted efforts by its residents.<ref name = "FWP3"/> The citizens of Hampshire County utilized this renewed vigor to reestablish and rebuild their institutions, municipal buildings, and businesses destroyed during the war.<ref name = "FWP3"/>

The memorial is also significant as it is thought to be the first monument erected to memorialize the Confederate dead in the [[United States]].<ref name = "Maxwell1"/><ref name = "Munske1"/><ref name = "HH1"/><ref name = "FWP1"/><ref name = "B&O1"/> Romney's claim as having the first Confederate Memorial is disputed by [[Cheraw, South Carolina|Cheraw]], [[South Carolina]], as its Confederate monument was dedicated two months prior on July 26, 1867.<ref name = "Johnson1">{{Harvnb|Johnson|2009|pp=36<U+2013>38.}}</ref><ref name = "Johnson2">{{Harvnb|Johnson|2009|p=144.}}</ref> However, its memorial omits the mention of "Confederacy," "Confederate," or "Southern."<ref name = "Johnson1"/>
