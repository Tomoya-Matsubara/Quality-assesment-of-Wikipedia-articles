The 11th '''HMS ''Tiger''''' was a [[battlecruiser]] of the [[Royal Navy]], built by [[John Brown and Company]], [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]], and launched in 1913. ''Tiger'' was the most heavily armoured battlecruiser of the Royal Navy at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] although she was still being finished when the war began. The ship was assigned to the [[1st Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battlecruiser Squadron]] (1st BCS) for the duration of the war and participated in the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]] in early 1915 even though she was still [[Shakedown (testing)|shaking down]] and did not perform well. She next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 where she was one of the British battlecruisers most often hit by German shells, although she was only lightly damaged. She spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although she did provide distant cover during the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in 1917.

''Tiger'' was the oldest battlecruiser retained by the Royal Navy after the tonnage limits of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] came into effect in 1922. She became a gunnery training ship in 1924 and then joined the Battlecruiser Squadron in 1929 while its [[flagship]], {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, underwent a lengthy refit. Upon ''Hood''{{'}}s return to service in 1931, ''Tiger'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1932 in accordance with the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]] of 1930.

==Design and description==
''Tiger'' was the sole battlecruiser authorised in the 1911<U+2013>12 Naval Programme, although it has been suggested that a sister-ship named ''Leopard'' was to have been begun in the 1912<U+2013>13 Programme, then was deferred until 1914 as a sixth member of the {{sclass|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|0}}.<ref>Breyer, p. 135</ref> There is no record however of any additional battlecruiser being provided for in any naval estimates before 1914.<ref>Brown, p. 60</ref><ref name=Times1911>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Navy Estimates |section=News |day_of_week=Friday |date=10 March 1911 |page_number=7 |issue=39529 |column=A }}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Navy Estimates |section=News |day_of_week=Friday |date=14 March 1913 |page_number=9 |issue=40159 |column=G }}</ref>

===General characteristics===
''Tiger'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|704|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a mean [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|32|ft|5|in|m}} at [[deep load]]. She normally displaced {{convert|28430|LT|MT|lk=on}} and {{convert|33260|LT|MT}} at deep load. Although ''Tiger'' was only {{convert|4|ft|1}} longer and {{convert|1|ft|5.5|in|m|1}} wider than the previous battlecruiser, {{HMS|Queen Mary}}, she displaced almost {{convert|2000|LT|MT}} more than the older ship. She had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|6.1|ft|1}} at deep load.<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 43, 45</ref>

===Propulsion===
''Tiger'' had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive [[steam turbine]]s housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern turbines, housed in the same casing, driving an inner shaft.<ref>Roberts 1978, p. 88</ref> Her three-bladed [[propeller]]s were {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m}} in diameter.<ref>Roberts 1997, p. 76</ref> The turbines were powered by 39 [[Babcock and Wilcox]] [[water-tube boiler]]s in five boiler rooms at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=b12>Burt, p. 212</ref> The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|85000|shp|lk=on}} and a maximum of {{convert|108000|shp|abbr=on}} when forced, but only achieved {{convert|104635|shp|abbr=on}} during her [[sea trial]]s, although she barely exceeded her maximum designed speed of {{convert|29|kn|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 76, 80</ref>

''Tiger's'' fuel stowage capacity was {{convert|3800|LT|MT}} of [[fuel oil]] and {{convert|3340|LT|MT}} of coal, giving a total bunkerage of {{convert|7140|LT|MT}} tons which compares very favourable to ''Queen Mary''{{'}}s total of {{convert|4800|LT|MT}}. Using the sole (unofficial) figure of ''Tiger's'' daily fuel consumption of {{convert|1245|LT|MT}} tons a day at {{convert|24|kn}},<ref>Parkes, p. 556</ref> it has been calculated that she would have had a maximum endurance of {{convert|3300|nmi|lk=on}}. The equivalent figure for ''Queen Mary'' was roughly {{convert|2400|nmi}}.<ref>Roberts 1978, p. 11</ref> Four [[direct current]] electric [[dynamo]]s with a total capacity of 750 [[kilowatt]]s supplied the common [[ring main]] at 220 [[volt]]s.<ref>Roberts 1978, p. 89</ref>

===Armament===
[[File:HMS Tiger diagrams Brasseys 1923.jpg|thumb||<center>As depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1923. This shows the topmast in the original forward position</center>]]
''Tiger'' mounted eight 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[BL 13.5 inch /45 naval gun|BL 13.5-inch Mark V guns]] in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'Y' from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to <U+2212>3<U+00B0> and elevated to 20<U+00B0>, although the [[rangefinder]]s controlling the turrets were limited to 15<U+00B0> 21' until superelevating prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation.<ref name=c27>Campbell 1978, p. 35</ref> They fired {{convert|1400|lb|kg|adj=on|0}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2582|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; at 14.75<U+00B0>, this provided a maximum range of {{convert|20000|yd|abbr=on|0}} with [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing (AP)]] shells. At 20<U+00B0> elevation, the range was extended to {{convert|23820|yd|m|abbr=on|0}}. The rate of fire of these guns was 1.5<U+2013>2 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_135-45_mk5.htm|title=British 13.5"/45 (34.3 cm) Mark V(L) 13.5"/45 (34.3 cm) Mark V(H)|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=4 March 2010|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref> The ships carried a total of 1040 rounds during wartime for 130 shells per gun.<ref name=b12/>

To defend herself against [[torpedo boat]]s, ''Tiger'' mounted twelve [[BL 6 inch Mk VII naval gun|BL 6-inch Mark VII guns]] in [[casemate]]s.<ref name=r3>Roberts 1997, p. 83</ref> The guns could depress to <U+2212>7<U+00B0> and had a maximum elevation of 14<U+00B0>. They fired {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2775|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}; this gave a maximum range of {{convert|14600|yd|m|abbr=on}} at 20<U+00B0> elevation. Their maximum rate of fire was 5<U+2013>7 rounds per minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_6-45_mk7.htm|title=British 6"/45 (15.2 cm) BL Mark VII 6"/45 (15.2 cm) BL Mark VIII 6"/45 (15.2 cm) BL Mark XXIV |date=21 January 2009|accessdate=13 August 2010|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref> They were provided with 120 rounds per gun.<ref name=b12/> The ship mounted a pair of [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 30 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> Mark I [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns on high-angle Mark II mounts.<ref name=r3/> They had a maximum depression of <U+2212>10<U+00B0> and a maximum elevation of 90<U+00B0>. They fired a {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2500|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 12<U+2013>14 rounds per minute. The gun had a maximum effective ceiling of {{convert|23500|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_3-45_mk1.htm|title=British 12-pdr (3"/45 (76.2 cm)) 20cwt QF HA Marks I, II, III and IV |date=27 February 2007|accessdate=11 November 2009|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref> Originally ''Tiger'' carried 300 rounds per gun, but this was reduced during the war to 150 rounds per gun.<ref name=c36>Campbell 1978, p. 36</ref>

Four {{convert|21|in|adj=on|0}} submerged [[torpedo tube]]s were fitted on the beam, one pair port and starboard forward of 'A' barbette and aft of 'X' barbette.<ref name=c36/> Twenty Mark II*** torpedoes were carried<ref name=r3/> which had a warhead of {{convert|515|lb|0}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]]. They had two speed settings which governed their range; at {{convert|45|kn}} they could reach {{convert|4500|yd}} or {{convert|10750|yd}} at {{convert|31|kn}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTBR_PreWWII.htm|title=British Torpedoes Pre-World War II: 21" (53.3 cm) Mark II***|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=7 March 2010|publisher=Navweaps.com}}</ref>

===Fire-control===
The main guns of ''Tiger'' were controlled from either of the two [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|fire-control director]]s. The primary director was in the [[Top (sailing ship)|fore-top]] on the foremast and the other was mounted on the aft superstructure in the torpedo control tower.<ref name=b12/> Data from a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on|1}} [[rangefinder]] in the armoured hood above the [[conning tower]] were input into a Mark VII* [[Dumaresq]] which sent its data to the Mk IV [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire Control Table]] located in the Transmitting Station (TS) below the [[waterline]] where they were converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns.<ref>Brooks, p. 170</ref> 'B' and 'X' turrets were provided with nine-foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions. A second Transmitting Station was fitted for the ship's secondary armament,<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 91<U+2013>92</ref> although a fire-control director for those guns was not fitted until 1915.<ref name=b19>Burt 1986, p. 219</ref>

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding the First World War and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director officer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.<ref>Roberts 1997, pp. 92<U+2013>93</ref>

During the war ''Tiger''{{'}}s rangefinders had increased in quantity and in size. By the end of the war 'A' and 'Q' turrets mounted {{convert|25|ft|1|adj=on}} rangefinders while 'X' turret, the armoured hood above the conning tower (also known as the gun control tower), and the torpedo control tower had {{convert|15|ft|1|adj=on}} instruments. A {{convert|12|ft|1|adj=on}} rangefinder was fitted in the fore-top and three 9-foot instruments were fitted on 'B' turret, the gun control tower and above the compass platform. A high-angle {{convert|6|ft|6|in|1|adj=on}} rangefinder was mounted above the roof of the fore-top for use by the anti-aircraft guns.<ref>Burt 1986, p. 213</ref>

===Armour===
[[File:HMS Tiger in drydock WWI NAC PA-007106.jpg|left|250px|thumb|''Tiger'' in drydock at Rosyth during her 1916<U+2013>17 refit]]
''Tiger''{{'}}s armour protection was similar to that of ''Queen Mary''; her [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[Krupp armour|Krupp cemented armour]] measured {{convert|9|in|mm|0}} thick amidships. It thinned to four&nbsp;inches towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The depth of the main belt below the waterline was reduced from {{convert|36|to|27|in|mm|0}}, although a [[strake]] of three-inch armour {{convert|3|ft|9|in}} tall was added below the main belt that stretched from the front of 'A' barbette to the rear of 'B' barbette. It was based on that used on the Japanese battlecruiser {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kongo||2}},<ref>Burt 1986, p. 214</ref> the only design influence on ''Tiger'' that can be attributed to the Japanese ship.<ref>Roberts 1978, p. 4</ref>

Like the {{sclass|Lion|battlecruiser|4}} ships and ''Queen Mary'', ''Tiger'' was given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six&nbsp;inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to {{convert|5|in|mm|0}} abreast the end turrets. Unlike those ships, however, ''Tiger'' had an additional strake of 6-inch armour above the upper belt protecting her secondary armament. Four-inch transverse [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s closed off the ends of the [[armoured citadel]]. High-tensile steel was used for the protective decks. They generally ranged from {{convert|1|to|1.5|in|0}} in thickness.<ref name=r23>Roberts 1997, pp. 112<U+2013>13</ref>

The gun turrets had 9-inch front and sides while their roofs were {{convert|2.5|to|3.25|in|mm|0}} thick. The [[barbette]]s were protected by {{convert|8|to|9|in|mm|0}} of armour above the citadel, but it thinned to three to four&nbsp;inches inside the citadel. The main conning tower sides were {{convert|10|in|0}} thick and it had a three-inch roof. The walls of the [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|communication tube]] were three to four&nbsp;inches thick. The after conning tower had 6-inch walls and a 3-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel [[torpedo bulkhead]]s {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|in|mm|0}} thick were fitted abreast the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and shell rooms.<ref name=r23/> After the [[Battle of Jutland]] revealed the ship's vulnerability to plunging shellfire, additional armour, weighing approximately {{convert|295|LT|t}}, was added to the decks over the magazines, turret roofs and for bulkheads to separate the 6-inch guns.<ref name=b19/>

==First World War==
''Tiger'' was laid down at the [[John Brown and Company]] shipyard in [[Clydebank]] on 6 June 1912. She was launched on 15 December 1913 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 3 October 1914.<ref>Roberts 1997, p. 41</ref> The ship was still under construction when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914. On 3 August 1914<ref name=Roberts123>Roberts 1997, p. 123</ref> Captain [[Henry Bertram Pelly]]<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Admiral Sir Henry Pelly |section=Obituaries |day_of_week=Tuesday |date=29 December 1942|page_number=6 |issue=49429 |column=F }}</ref> was appointed to command the incomplete ship. Beatty described Pelly at the time as "a very charming person and, what is more important just now, a very efficient officer".<ref>Beatty, p. 160</ref> After the [[Battle of Coronel]] and the deployment of four battlecruisers to hunt for the [[German East Asia Squadron]], ''Tiger'' was ordered to cut short her firing trials off [[Berehaven]]<ref>Goldrick, p. 173</ref> and was commissioned into the First Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) two months later, on 3 October<ref name=Roberts123/> and began trials and working up. Beatty described ''Tiger'' to the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet [[Jackie Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Lord Fisher of Kilverstone]] as "not yet fit to fight. Three out of her four [[dynamo]]es are out of action for an indefinite period, and her training is impeded by bad weather, which might continue for many weeks at this time of year, and at present is quite unprepared and inefficient."<ref>Fisher, p. 171</ref>

===Battle of Dogger Bank===
{{Main|Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)}}
On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral [[Franz von Hipper]] sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. However, the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty. Contact was initiated at 7:20 a.m.<ref group=Note>The times used in this article are in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is one hour behind [[Central European Time|CET]], which is often used in German works.</ref> on the 24th when the British light cruiser {{HMS|Arethusa|1913|2}} spotted the German light cruiser {{SMS|Kolberg}}. By 7:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at {{convert|20|kn}}, believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to {{SMS|Bl<U+00FC>cher||2}}'s maximum speed of {{convert|23|kn}} if they were British battlecruisers.<ref>Massie, pp. 376<U+2013>84</ref>

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}}, {{HMS|Princess Royal|1911|2}} and ''Tiger'', were doing {{convert|27|kn}} in pursuit and ''Lion'' opened fire at 8:52 at a range of {{convert|20000|yd}}. The other ships followed a few minutes later but, hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility, they did not score their first hit on ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' until 9:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 9:11, at a range of {{convert|18000|yd}}, and concentrated their fire on ''Lion''. At 9:35 Beatty signalled 'Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line', but Captain Pelly, believing that {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|2}} was already engaging ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', fired at {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}, as did ''Lion'', which left {{SMS|Moltke||2}} unengaged and able to continue to engage ''Lion'' without risk.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref>

[[File:SMS Moltke.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A prewar postcard of ''Moltke'' underway]]
In the meantime ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers; her speed had dropped to {{convert|17|kn}} and her steering gear had been jammed. Beatty ordered ''Indomitable'' to attack her at 10:48 AM. Six minutes later Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine [[periscope]] on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90<U+00B0> turn to port to avoid the submarine, although he failed to hoist the 'Submarine Warning' flag because most of ''Lion''{{'}}s signal halyards had been shot away. Almost immediately afterward ''Lion'' lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power. He ordered 'Course Northeast' at 11:02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper. He also hoisted 'Attack the rear of the enemy' on the other halyard although there was no connection between the two signals. This caused Rear-Admiral Sir [[Archibald Moore]], temporarily commanding in {{HMS|New Zealand|1911|2}}, to think that that the signals meant to attack ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', which was about {{convert|8000|yd}} to the northeast. So they turned away from the pursuit of Hipper's main body and engaged ''Bl<U+00FC>cher''. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze.<ref>Massie, pp. 398<U+2013>402</ref>

He transferred his flag to the destroyer {{HMS|Attack|1911|2}} at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' sank and boarded ''Princess Royal'' at 12:20. He ordered the pursuit resumed of the German battlecruisers, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' and Hipper's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. ''Lion'' was headed home at {{convert|10|kn}} when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12:45.<ref>Tarrant, p. 38</ref>

During the action, ''Tiger'' was hit by six German shells, the most significant of which was a {{convert|28|cm|adj=on}} shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's [[Breech-loading weapon|breech mechanism]] and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. ''Tiger''{{'}}s repairs were completed on 8 February.<ref>Campbell 1978, p. 40</ref> Like the rest of the battlecruisers, ''Tiger''{{'}}s own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 {{convert|13.5|in|adj=on}} shells fired. Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy:

Lord Fisher was moved to write: "The ''Tiger''{{'}}s gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to have had a lot of practice."<ref>Fisher, p. 155</ref> and Captain Pelly was described as a "[[wikt:poltroon|poltroon]]".<ref>Quoted in Goldrick, p. 298</ref> In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through ''Tiger''{{'}}s part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them.  My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success."<ref>Beatty, pp. 245<U+2013>48</ref> The ship was given a refit in December 1915.<ref name=Roberts123/>

====Battle of Jutland====
{{Main|Battle of Jutland}}
[[File:Jutland1916.jpg||thumb|400px|Diagram of the Battle of Jutland showing the major movements]]
On 31 May 1916, ''Tiger'' and the 1st BCS had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, under Beatty's overall command, to intercept a sortie by the [[High Seas Fleet]] into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 p.m., but Beatty's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 3:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east south-east, positioning the British ships to cut off the German's line of retreat, and signalled [[action stations]]. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to {{convert|18|kn}} to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, {{convert|60|mi}} behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75</ref>

This began what was to be called the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than {{convert|18000|yd}} away. The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'', had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The 1st BCS was [[Echelon formation|echeloned]] to the right with ''Tiger'' in the rear and the furthest to the west, closest to the Germans. ''Tiger'' missed Beatty's fire distribution order, as had ''Queen Mary'', and Tiger engaged ''Moltke'', instead of ''Seydlitz'' as Beatty intended.<ref>Brooks, pp. 236<U+2013>41</ref> The German fire was accurate from the start, with ''Tiger'' hit six times by ''Moltke'' within the first seven minutes; although two of these hits temporarily disabled both 'Q' and 'X' turrets, she was not seriously damaged.<ref name="Campbell 1978, p. 42">Campbell 1978, p. 42</ref> By 3:54, the range was down to {{convert|12900|yd}}; Beatty ordered a course change two [[Boxing the compass|points]] to starboard to open up the range at 3:57.<ref>Tarrant, p. 83</ref>

The range gradually increased until the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 4:12 and 4:15 to close the range. By 4:25, the range was down to {{convert|14400|yd}} and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, ''Queen Mary'' was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 89<U+2013>91</ref> ''Tiger'', following in ''Queen Mary''{{'}}s wake at a distance of only {{convert|500|yd}}, had to put her helm hard-a-starboard to avoid colliding with the wreckage.<ref>Massie, p. 595</ref> At 4:30, the light cruiser {{HMS|Southampton|1912|2}}, scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Reinhard Scheer]]'s battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north.<ref>Massie, pp. 598<U+2013>600</ref> By this time ''Tiger'' had been hit a total of 17 times, all but one fired by ''Moltke'', but she remained fit to fight.<ref>Tarrant, p. 97</ref>

The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit,<ref>Massie, p. 601</ref> but Beatty's ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then northeast, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the [[Grand Fleet]], and at 5:40 p.m. opened fire again on their German counterparts. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47.<ref>Tarrant, p. 109</ref> Beatty gradually turned towards the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division to manoeuvre away from the Germans. By 6:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180<U+00B0> starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 130<U+2013>38</ref> At 6:44, Beatty turned his ships southeast, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper's force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of ''New Zealand'', while slowing to {{convert|18|kn}} and altering course to the south to stay close to the Grand Fleet. At this moment ''Lion''{{'}}s [[gyrocompass]] failed and she, followed by the rest of the battlecruisers, made a complete circle before her steering was brought back under control.<ref>Tarrant, p. 145</ref> At 6:55, Scheer ordered another 180<U+00B0> turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to [[Crossing the T|cross Scheer's "T"]] and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180<U+00B0> turn at 7:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the trap his manoeuvring caused.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 149, 157</ref>

The British lost sight of the Germans until {{HMS|Castor|1915|6}} spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 8:05 p.m. then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. On hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only {{convert|8500|yd}} away. ''Inflexible'' opened fire at 8:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers.<ref>Tarrant, p. 175</ref> Shortly after 8:30, the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans only fired a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, and disappeared into the mist around 8:40.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 177<U+2013>78</ref> Beatty's battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 2:55 a.m.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 178, 224</ref>

''Tiger'' and the rest of the battlecruisers reached [[Rosyth Dockyard]] in Scotland on the morning of 2 June. The ship was docked the next day for repairs which took until 1 July, the first of the "Splendid Cats" to be repaired. ''Tiger'' was hit a total of 18 times during the battle, mostly by shells fired by ''Moltke''. She suffered 24 men killed and 46 wounded during the battle. The battlecruiser fired 303 shells from her main guns during the battle and is credited with one hit on ''Moltke'' and two on {{SMS|von der Tann||2}}. The ship also fired 136 rounds from her 6-inch guns at the light cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}} and German [[destroyer]]s.<ref name="Campbell 1978, p. 42"/>

After her repairs were completed, ''Tiger'' served as the temporary flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron while ''Lion'' was under repair.<ref name=b20>Burt 1986, p. 220</ref> In the meantime, on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by [[Room 40]] which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers.<ref group=Note>While no sources explicitly state that ''Tiger'' was part of the fleet at this time, of the seven Royal Navy battlecruisers then in commission, ''Indomitable'' was under refit through August and the only one unavailable for action. See Roberts, p. 122</ref> Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again.  Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the [[Harwich Force]] under Commodore [[Reginald Tyrwhitt|Tyrwhitt]]. Having realised their mistake the Germans then shaped course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home, the British having lost two cruisers to submarine attacks and the Germans having a dreadnought damaged by torpedo.<ref>Marder, p. 287<U+2013>96</ref>

The ship received a lengthy refit from 10 November 1916 to 29 January 1917 at Rosyth<ref name=r23/> where her deck and turret roof armour was reinforced and additional rangefinders were added over her conning tower and the rear of 'X' turret.<ref name=b19/> ''Tiger'' had an uneventful time for the rest of the war, conducting patrols of the [[North Sea]] as the [[High Seas Fleet]] was forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces.<ref>Newbolt, p. 169</ref> The same year saw her undergo a minor refit during which a flying-off platform for a [[Sopwith Camel]] was mounted on 'Q' turret and a searchlight platform was added to her third funnel. She underwent a more extensive refit in 1918 which saw her mainmast shifted to the top of the derrick-stump and a more substantial observation platform added to the foremast. Some of her short rangefinders were replaced by longer ones as well.<ref name=b19/> The resulting change in appearance was decried by the editors of the 1919 edition of ''Jane's Fighting Ships'', who wrote that ''Tiger'' had been "a remarkably handsome ship until the present hideous rig was adopted in 1918."<ref>{{cite book|title=Jane's Fighting Ships|url=http://www.pbenyon1.plus.com/Janes_1919/B_Ships/Tiger_64.html|year=1919|publisher=Jane's|location=London|pages=64<U+2013>65|access=21 September 2010}}</ref>

==Postwar Service==
''Tiger'' remained in service with the Royal Navy after the [[Armistice with Germany]] and collided with the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}} in late 1920 while assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]].<ref name=b20/> She survived the culling of older capital ships following the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], although she was placed in [[Wikt:mothball|reserve]] on 22 August 1921.<ref name=Roberts123/> In 1919 a flying-off platform was add on 'B' turret's roof. The ship was refitted in March 1922 with a 25-foot rangefinder fitted on 'X' turret, her original pair of 3-inch AA guns replaced by four {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} guns, and the flying-off platform on 'Q' turret was removed.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 219<U+2013>20</ref> On 14 February 1924, she was recommissioned and became a sea-going training ship, a role she served in throughout the 1920s. Her last major period of activity came in 1929, when the Royal Navy's newest battlecruiser, the ill-fated {{HMS|Hood|51|2}}, went into dockyard hands for a refit. While ''Hood'' was out of commission, ''Tiger'' returned to active service to keep the Royal Navy's three-ship [[British Battlecruiser Squadron|Battlecruiser Squadron]] (normally made up of ''Hood'' plus the smaller {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} and {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}) up to strength. Although by the 1930s ''Tiger'' was still in fair condition and was not a terribly old ship, her death knell was sounded by the [[London Naval Conference]] of 1930, during which ''Tiger'' was sacrificed by the [[Admiralty]] as part of an overall reduction in world battleship fleets. Under the command of Captain [[Kenneth Dewar]] she remained in service with the fleet until ''Hood'' came out of refit in early 1931, at which time she was taken out of commission in accordance with the terms of the [[London Naval Treaty]].<ref>Burt 1993, pp. 23, 51</ref>

''Tiger'' took the cheers of the Atlantic Fleet on 30 March 1931 at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]].<ref>Parkes, p. 557</ref> She [[Ship decommissioning|paid off]] for the last time on 15 May 1931 at Rosyth, before being sold to T. W. Ward of [[Inverkeithing]] for breaking up in February 1932.<ref name=Roberts123/>
