'''Gregory Errol Chamitoff''' (born 6 August 1962 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]) is an [[engineer]] and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. He was assigned to [[Expedition 17]] and flew to the [[International Space Station]] on [[STS-124]], launching 31 May 2008. He was in space 198 days, joining [[Expedition 18]] after Expedition 17 left the station, and returned to Earth 30 November 2008 on [[STS-126]]. Chamitoff served as a mission specialist on the [[STS-134]] mission, which was the last flight of [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]] and delivered the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]].

==Personal==
Chamitoff was born 6 August 1962 in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada to a Jewish family of Russian origin<ref>{{cite web|quote=my whole family<U+2019>s from Montreal, although a generation before that they<U+2019>re from Russia|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition17/exp17_interview_Chamitoff.html|title=Preflight Interview: Gregory Chamitoff|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]}}</ref> and is married to Alison Chantal Caviness, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D. They have two children, Natasha and Dimitri.

On his father's side of the family, he is also related to the owners of the famous Fairmount bagel establishment in Montreal, from which Chamitoff brought bagels into space on his first mission into orbit. 

Chamitoff's recreational interests include [[scuba diving]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[Aviation|flying]], [[skiing]], [[racquetball]], [[Aikido]], [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]] and [[guitar]]. He is a certified [[divemaster]] and instrument rated pilot.  Chamitoff also enjoys [[chess]] and has played games with people on earth while living in the ISS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=4875|title=Chess in Space: Houston, we have a checkmate|date=August 29, 2008|publisher=[[ChessBase]]|accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref>

His education includes:
*Blackford High School, [[San Jose, California]], 1980.
*B.S., Electrical Engineering, [[California Polytechnic State University]], 1984.
*M.S., Aeronautical Engineering, [[California Institute of Technology]], 1985.
*Ph.D., Aeronautics and Astronautics, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], 1992.
*M.S., Planetary Geology (Space Science), [[University of Houston<U+2013>Clear Lake]], 2002.

==Career==
As an undergraduate student at Cal Poly, Chamitoff taught lab courses in circuit design and worked summer internships at Four Phase Systems, Atari Computers, Northern Telecom, and IBM. He developed a self-guided robot for his undergraduate thesis project.  While at MIT and [[Draper Labs]] (1985<U+2013>1992), Chamitoff worked on several NASA projects. He performed stability analyses for the deployment of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], designed flight control upgrades for the Space Shuttle autopilot, and worked on the attitude control system for Space Station Freedom. His doctoral thesis developed a new approach for robust intelligent flight control of hypersonic vehicles. From 1993 to 1995, Chamitoff was a visiting professor at the [[University of Sydney]], Australia, where he led a research group in the development of autonomous flight vehicles, and taught courses in flight dynamics and control. He has published numerous papers on aircraft and spacecraft guidance and control, [[trajectory optimization]], and Mars mission design. Dr Chamitoff is currently the Lawrence Hargrave Professor of Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia.  He is also Professor of Engineering Practice in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University. 

==NASA career==

In 1995, Chamitoff joined the Motion Control Systems Group in the Mission Operations Directorate at the [[Johnson Space Center]], where he developed software applications for spacecraft attitude control monitoring, prediction, analysis, and maneuver optimization.

Selected by NASA for the Astronaut Class of 1998, Chamitoff started training in August 1998 and qualified for flight assignment as a Mission Specialist in 2000. Since then, Chamitoff has worked in the Space Station Robotics branch, been the lead [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] for ISS [[Expedition 9]], acted as Crew Support Astronaut for ISS [[Expedition 6]], and helped develop onboard procedures and displays for Space Station system operations.

In July 2002, Chamitoff was a crew-member on the [[Aquarius (laboratory)|Aquarius]] [[Underwater habitat|undersea research habitat]] for 9 days as part of the [[NEEMO#NEEMO 3: July 15<U+2013>21, 2002|NEEMO 3]] mission (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations).<ref name="three">{{Cite web|url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/scripts/mission/miss.cfm?mis_index=212|title=Life Sciences Data Archive : Experiment|author=NASA|date=April 21, 2011|publisher=NASA|accessdate=September 22, 2011}}</ref>

He served as the backup Expedition 15/16 Flight Engineer 2 and [[STS-117]]/[[STS-120]] Mission Specialist 5 for [[Clayton Anderson]].

Chamitoff served on a long duration mission to the International Space Station. He launched as a Mission Specialist on board Space Shuttle mission [[STS-124]]. He was Flight Engineer 2 and Science Officer on [[Expedition 17]]. He returned home as a Mission Specialist on [[STS-126]], completing a tour that lasted six months.
As part of his personal allowance, Chamitoff brought the first [[bagel]]s into space, 3 bags (18 sesame seed [[Montreal-style bagel|bagels]]) of [[Fairmount Bagel]]s with him, from his cousin's bagel bakery.<ref>CTV.ca [http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080601/montreal_space_bagels_080601/20080601?hub=TopStories Montreal-born astronaut brings bagels into space] Sun.
