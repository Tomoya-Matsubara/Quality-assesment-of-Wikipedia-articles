'''''I'm Your Baby Tonight''''' is the third [[studio album]] by American [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] recording artist [[Whitney Houston]]. It was released by [[Arista Records]] on November 6, 1990. Following the run of this album, Houston continued to achieve widespread commercial success throughout the 1990s, venturing heavily into films<U+2014>while continuing to record via their adjoining soundtrack albums. Subsequently, ''I'm Your Baby Tonight'' would not be followed up with another studio album until 1998's ''[[My Love Is Your Love]]''.

==Background==
Like many artists, Houston's previous efforts featured material mostly chosen by the label. With this project, however, she had more control over the album's content. In addition to working with the previous producers of [[Narada Michael Walden]] and [[Michael Masser]], she also worked with the production team of [[L.A. Reid]] and [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]], as well as singer [[Luther Vandross]], and did a collaboration with [[Stevie Wonder]]. Houston would also produce the song "I'm Knockin'", with tour music director Ricky Minor and co-write the song "Takin' a Chance".

==Music==
''I'm Your Baby Tonight'' features [[funk]] and [[dance music|dance]]-driven [[pop music]]. The Walden-produced songs are divided by contemporary [[dance-pop]] tracks and ornate [[ballad]]s, while Reid and Babyface's productions reappropriate 1970s black pop and danceable funk with aggressive 1980s dance rhythms.<ref name="Hunter"/> According to [[Allmusic]]'s Ashley S. Battel, Houston "attempts to make a larger foray into [[dance music]]" with this album,<ref name="Battel"/> while [[David Browne]] observed light [[synthesizer]] flourishes, thumping drum beats, and "dance-fever settings" throughout.<ref name="Browne"/> James Hunter of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the album as "a [[case study]] in how much [Houston] can get out of her luscious and straightforward vocal gifts within a dancepop framework."<ref name="Hunter"/> [[J. D. Considine]] wrote that Houston's singing on the album features "sultry moans, [[bent note|note-bending]] asides, [and] window-rattling [[Shout Music|gospel shouts]]".<ref name="Considine"/> ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's Jim Macnie said that the album "displayed a slick [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] edge."<ref>{{cite web|last=Macnie|first=Jim|title=Whitney Houston Biography|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/whitney-houston/biography|work=The Rolling Stones}}</ref>
