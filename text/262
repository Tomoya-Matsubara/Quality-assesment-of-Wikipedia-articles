'''SMS ''Von der Tann'''''<ref>"SMS" stands for "Seiner Majest<U+00E4>t Schiff", or "His Majesty's Ship" in  [[German language|German]].</ref> was the first [[battlecruiser]] built for the German [[Kaiserliche Marine]], as well as Germany's first major [[Steam turbine|turbine]] powered warship. At the time of her construction, ''Von der Tann'' was the fastest [[dreadnought]]-type warship afloat, capable of reaching speeds in excess of 28&nbsp;[[Knot (speed)|knots]].<ref name="Staff 9"> Staff, p9 </ref>  Built by [[Blohm + Voss]] in [[Hamburg]],<ref>Weir, p15</ref> ''Von der Tann'' was to be the workhorse of the [[High Seas Fleet]] Scouting Squadron. 

''Von der Tann's'' design set the precedent that survivability was of the utmost importance for all subsequent German battlecruisers; ''Von der Tann'' had much thicker armour than her British rivals, and more of the ship was protected. This was achieved through the use of smaller main guns: {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} compared to the {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns on the [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible'']] and [[Indefatigable class battlecruiser|''Indefatigable'' classes]]. This emphasis on protection, coupled with safer German ammunition handling practices, was to have important ramifications during the naval engagements of the [[World War I|First World War]] when the two battlecruiser concepts were pitted against each other.

The ship participated in several major actions during the First World War, including the [[Battle of Jutland]], where ''Von der Tann'' destroyed the British battlecruiser [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|HMS ''Indefatigable'']] during the first few minutes of the engagement. The ship was hit several times by large calibre shells during the battle, but the damage was quickly repaired and ''Von der Tann'' returned to the fleet within two months. 

Following the end of the war in 1918, ''Von der Tann'', along with the majority of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at [[Scapa Flow]] pending a decision by the Allies as to the fleet's fate. There the ship met her end when she was [[Scuttling|scuttled]] by her crew in 1919, to prevent the ship from falling into British hands. The wreck of ''Von der Tann'' was subsequently raised in 1930, and scrapped at [[Rosyth]] from 1931 to 1934.

{{TOClimit|limit=3}}

==Development==
The preceding German large cruiser design, [[SMS Bl<U+00FC>cher|''Bl<U+00FC>cher'']], was an incremental increase over previous armoured cruisers. ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was armed with 12 {{convert|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, and was designed to counter what the Germans knew at the time about the British [[Invincible class battlecruiser|''Invincible'' class]], which were assumed to be larger iterations of the basic [[armoured cruiser]] type.<ref> Staff, p3ndash;4</ref> Once sufficient information about the new British cruisers had become available, it became obvious that they were not simply an enlargement on previous designs but a whole new type of warship&mdash;the [[battlecruiser]]&mdash;to which ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' was quite inferior. However, there were insufficient funds to alter ''Bl<U+00FC>cher's'' layout, so the cruiser assigned for 1907 would have be of an entirely new design. <ref name="Staff 4"> Staff, p4</ref>

Design of ''Von der Tann'' began in August 1906, under the name "Cruiser ''F''", amid disagreements over the intended role of the new ship. [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral Tirpitz]] advocated a ship similar to the new British battlecruisers of the ''Invincible'' class: heavier guns, lighter armour, and higher speed with the intention of using the ship as a fleet scout and to destroy the opposing fleet's cruisers. Tirpitz had no intention of using the ship in the main battle line.<ref>Staff, p3</ref> [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] however, along with most of the ''Reichsmarineamt'' (Navy Office) was in favour of incorporating the ship into the battle line after initial contact was made, which necessitated much heavier armour.<ref name= "Staff p5">Staff, p5</ref> This insistence upon the capability to fight in the battle line was a result of the numerical inferiority of the German High Seas fleet compared to the British [[Royal Navy]]. <ref> Staff, p3</ref>

Several design proposals were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|34.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} calibres.<ref name="Staff 4" /> However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry would be used instead. The final design therefore used the same {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} double turret used by the [[Nassau class battleship|''Nassau'' class]] [[battleship]]s.<ref>Weir, p82</ref> In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.<ref>Breyer, p270</ref>

At a conference in September 1906, many of the disagreements over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor von Eickstedt argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser hadn't been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design.<ref>Philbin p66</ref> He also argued that guns of {{convert|21|cm|in|abbr=on}} or {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}} calibre would be sufficient to penetrate the armour of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship to be able to engage battleships, the {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} calibre guns were necessary.<ref name="Philbin 67"> Philbin p67</ref> 

Admiral Capelle, the deputy director of the Imperial Navy Office stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns, if the displacement of around {{convert|19000|t|ST|abbr=on}} was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider the possibility of using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of {{convert|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns instead of the {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.<ref name="Philbin 67" />

On [[22 June]] [[1907]], the Kaiser authorised construction of Cruiser ''F'',<ref name= "Staff p5"> </ref> to be named ''Von der Tann'', named after [[Ludwig Freiherr von und zu der Tann-Rathsamhausen]], a Bavarian general who fought in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870. The contract was awarded to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg, on [[26 September]] [[1907]]. The [[keel]] was laid on [[21 March]] [[1908]], and the ship was launched nearly a year later, on [[20 March]] [[1909]]. The ship cost 36.523&nbsp;billion [[German gold mark|Marks]].<ref name= "Staff p5"> </ref>

==Design==
===Armament===
''Von der Tann'' carried eight {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK L/45<ref>In Imperial German Navy gun nomenclature, "SK" (Schiffskanone) denotes that the gun is emplaced on a ship, while the L/45 denotes the length of the gun. In this case, the L/45 gun is 45 [[Calibers#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|calibers]], meaning that the gun is 45 times long as it is in diameter. </ref> guns, mounted in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]: one fore, one aft, and two staggered [[Gun_turret#Wing_turrets|wing turrets]]. The guns were emplaced in the Drh.L&nbsp;C/1907 turntable mount, which was traversed electrically, while the guns themselves used hydraulics to change elevation.<ref name= "Staff p5"> </ref> The guns could be elevated up to 20&nbsp;degrees, which enabled a maximum range of {{convert|18900|m|yd|abbr=on}}. After refit in 1915, this was increased to {{convert|20400|m|yd|abbr=on}}. The main guns fired a {{convert|302|kg|lb|abbr=on}} armoured-piercing shell that had a [[muzzle velocity]] of 875&nbsp;mps; the main [[propellant]] charges were encased in a brass [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]]. A total of 660 these projectiles were stored in four shell rooms, each containing 165 shells.<ref name= "Staff p5"> </ref> The wing turrets were staggered in such a way that all eight guns were able to fire on broadside on a very wide arc.<ref> Hough, p87</ref>

Unlike her British contemporaries, ''Von der Tann'' also carried a heavy secondary battery, consisting of ten {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK&nbsp;L/45  guns, [[casemate]]d in MPL&nbsp;C/06 pivot mounts, each with 150 [[high explosive]] and [[Armour-piercing shot and shell|armoured piercing]] shells. At construction, these guns could fire their {{convert|45.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shells at targets up to {{convert|13500|m|yd|abbr=on}} away; after the 1915 refit, their maximum range was extended to {{convert|16800|m|yd|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Staff p6">Staff, p6</ref> She was also armed with sixteen {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} SK&nbsp;L/45 guns, to defend against [[torpedo boat]]s and [[destroyer]]s. These were also emplaced in pivot mounts, of the MPL&nbsp;C/01-06 type, with a total of 3,200 shells for these guns. These guns fired a {{convert|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} shell at the high rate of 15 rounds per minute, up to a range of {{convert|10694|m|yd|abbr=on}}, which was quite long for a smaller calibre weapon.<ref name="Staff p6" /> In late 1916, following repair work after the damage sustained during the Battle of Jutland, ''Von der Tann'' had her {{convert|8.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} guns removed and the firing ports welded shut. Two 8.8&nbsp;cm flak guns were installed on the aft superstructure.<ref name= "Staff 8"> Staff,  p8</ref>

As was customary of capital ships of the time, ''Von der Tann'' was equipped with four [[torpedo tube]]s, with a total of 11 torpedoes. One was located in the bow, one in the stern, and two on the [[broadside]]. The torpedoes carried an {{convert|110|kg|lb|abbr=on}} warhead, and had an effective range of {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} when set for a speed of {{convert|32|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|1.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|36|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name= "Staff p6"> </ref>

===Armour===
Because the ''Von der Tann'' was designed to fight in the [[Line of battle|battle line]], her armour was much thicker than that of the British battlecruisers. ''Von der Tann'' weighed over 2,000&nbsp;tonnes more than than the [[Indefatigable class battlecruiser|''Indefatigable'' class]],<ref>Butler, p50</ref> and used 10% more of her weight for armour than her eventual opponents at the [[Battle of Jutland]].<ref name= "Staff p6"> </ref>

''Von der Tann'''s armour consisted of [[Krupp]] cemented and nickel steel. The main belt armour was {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}}-{{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick forward, {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick over the ship's citadel, and was {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick aft. The forward [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}}, while the aft conning tower was protected by {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The four turrets had {{convert|230|mm|in|abbr=on}} faces, {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} sides, and {{convert|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the roofs. The horizontal armour measured {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and the sloping deck armour was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.<ref> Staff, p6&ndash;7</ref> Like the [[armoured cruiser]] [[SMS Bl<U+00FC>cher|''Bl<U+00FC>cher'']] before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. It was set back a distance of {{convert|4|m|ft|0}} from the outer hull skin, the space in between being used to store coal.<ref name= "Staff p7"> Staff, p7</ref>

===Machinery===
''Von der Tann'' was powered by 18 naval double boilers, separated into five boiler rooms. The boilers produced steam at a pressure of 235&nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (16 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]]).<ref name= "Staff p7"> </ref> ''Von der Tann'' was the first large German warship to use turbine propulsion. The ship used two sets of turbines: high pressure turbines, which ran the outer two shafts, and low pressure turbines, which powered the inner two shafts. Each shaft had a propeller {{convert|3.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. The ship was designed to have a power output of 42,000 shaft horsepower (31,000&nbsp;kW) at a speed of 300&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], which enabled a top speed of 
{{convert|24.8|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}. However, as was the case with all later German battlecruisers, the ship could be run dramatically higher. During [[Sea trial|trials]], the turbines provided 79,802&nbsp;shp (59,508&nbsp;kW) at 339&nbsp;rpm for a top speed of {{convert|27.75|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref name= "Staff 8"> </ref> 
The ship had two parallel rudders, which were controlled by steam-powered engines. ''Von der Tann's'' electrical plant consisted of six steam turbo generators that had a total output of {{convert|1200|kW|hp|abbr=on}}.<ref name= "Staff 8"> </ref>

Like many German capital ships<ref>The higher quality coal was generally reserved for the smaller craft, whose crews were less able to clean the boilers at the increased rate demanded by the low-quality coal. As a result, German capital ships were often supplied with poor coal, in the knowledge that their larger crews were better able to perform the increased maintenance requirement.</ref> ''Von der Tann'' had chronic problems with the often low-quality coal available for the ship's boilers. Following the end of the raid on Scarborough, ''Von der Tann's'' commander, Captain Max von Hahn remarked that "the inadequacy of our coal and its burning properties results in heavy smoke clouds and signals our presence."<ref>Philbin, p56</ref> During the battle of Jutland, the ship was unable to maintain fires in all of her boilers after 16:00, due to the poor quality coal.<ref>Philbin, p56&ndash;57</ref> Many other German ships suffered the same difficulties during the battle, including [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']] and [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']].<ref>Philbin, p57</ref> After 1916, the coal firing in the boilers was supplemented by spraying [[Coal tar|tar-oil]] on the coal, which made the coal burn better. <ref name= "Staff 8" />

===Other characteristics===
Like all the German battlecruisers that would follow her, she was considerably faster than her design speed of 
{{convert|24|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}. In one instance, the ship averaged 
{{convert|27|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} during a cruise from [[Tenerife]] to Germany, reaching a maximum speed of 
{{convert|28|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}. In fact, at the time of her launch she was the fastest [[dreadnought]] afloat.<ref name="Staff 4"/>

Frahm [[Ship_stability#Antiroll_Tanks|anti-roll tanks]] were fitted during construction, but these later proved to be ineffective;<ref name= "Staff p7"> </ref> the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%.<ref name= "Staff 45"> Staff, p45 </ref> [[Bilge keel]]s were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage.<ref name="Hore battleships"> Hore, p71 </ref> The ship was able to carry an additional {{convert|180|t|ST|abbr=on}} of coal in the anti-roll tanks.<ref> Gardiner, Gray, and Budzbon, p151</ref> ''Von der Tann's'' hull was comprised of 15 watertight compartments, and a [[double bottom]] extended for 75% of the ship's length. <ref name= "Staff p5"/> The ship was known to have good manoeuvring characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] of 8&nbsp;degrees at full rudder.<ref name= "Staff p7"> </ref>

The ship's crew compartments were arranged such that the officers were accommodated in the [[forecastle]]. This arrangement was found to be unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes.<ref name= "Staff 45"/> ''Von der Tann'' was designed to be fitted with a [[lattice mast]], but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, [[seaplane]] trials were conducted on ''Von der Tann'', and a crane was attached on the aft deck to lift the seaplane aboard the ship. ''Von der Tann'' had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916.<ref name= "Staff 8"> </ref>

==Service record==
===Peace-time===
In May 1910, ''Von der Tann'' sailed from the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg to receive her final fitting-out in the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|Imperial Dockyard]] at [[Kiel]]. The German Navy was chronically short of crews at the time, so dockyard workers had to bring the ship to Kiel. On [[1 September]] [[1910]], the ship was commissioned into the German Navy, with a crew composed largely of crew-members from the dreadnought [[SMS Rheinland|''Rheinland'']].<ref name="Staff 9" /> During trials, an average speed of {{convert|27|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} was attained over a six-hour period, with a top speed of {{convert|28.124|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} with the engines at full tilt.<ref name="Staff 9" />

The ''Von der Tann'' made several long distance voyages after completion. She visited [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Puerto Belgrano|Puerto Militar]], and [[Bah<U+00ED>a Blanca]] in South America in early 1911, returning to Kiel, Germany on [[6 May]] [[1911]]. On [[8 May]] [[1911]], ''Von der Tann'' joined the Unit of Reconnaissance Ships. In June 1911 ''Von der Tann'' attended the [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]], for the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].

===World War I===
At the outbreak of [[World War I]], ''Von der Tann'' was serving as the [[flagship]] of the 3rd Admiral of Reconnaissance Forces, Konteradmiral Tapken. She took part in the unsuccessful search for British battlecruisers after the [[Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in August 1914.<ref name="Hore battleships" /> 

====Battle of Heligoland Bight====
During the Battle of Heligoland Bight, ''Von der Tann'' had been stationed in [[Wilhelmshaven]] Roads, and had been ordered to raise steam as early as 08:20, to assist the German cruisers under attack in the [[Heligoland Bight|Heligoland Bight]]. At 08:50, [[Franz von Hipper|Rear Admiral Hipper]] requested permission from Admiral [[Friedrich von Ingenohl|von Ingenohl]], the commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet, to send ''Von der Tann'' and [[SMS Moltke|''Moltke'']] to relieve the beleaguered German cruisers.<ref> Massie, p107 </ref> ''Von der Tann'' was ready to sail by 10:15, more than an hour before the British battlecruisers arrived on the scene. However, the ship was held up by the low tide, which prevented the battlecruisers from crossing the [[Shoal|bar]] at the mouth of the [[Jadebusen|Jade Estuary]]. At 14:10, ''Von der Tann'' and ''Moltke'' were able to cross the Jade bar, and Hipper ordered the German [[light cruiser]]s to fall back on the two heavy ships, while Hipper himself was about an hour behind in the battlecruiser [[SMS Seydlitz|''Seydlitz'']]. At 14:25, the remaining light cruisers, [[SMS Strassburg|''Strassburg'']], [[SMS Stettin|''Stettin'']], [[SMS Frauenlob|''Frauenlob'']], [[SMS Stralsund|''Stralsund'']], and [[SMS Ariadne|''Ariadne'']] rendezvoused with the battlecruisers,<ref>Strachan, p417</ref> while ''Seydlitz'' arrived on the scene by 15:10, while ''Ariadne'' succumbed to battle damage and sank. Hipper ventured forth cautiously, to search for the two missing light cruisers, [[SMS Mainz|''Mainz'']] and [[SMS K<U+00F6>ln (1909)|''K<U+00F6>ln'']]. By 16:00, the German flotilla turned around to return to the Jade Estuary, returning at approximately 20:23.<ref> Massie p114 </ref>

====Bombardments of Yarmouth and Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby====
Later that year she was present at the [[Raid on Yarmouth]], on 2&ndash;3&nbsp;November. At 16:30 on the 2nd, ''Von der Tann'', along with ''Seydlitz'' (Hipper's flagship), ''Moltke'', the armoured cruiser ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', and the four light cruisers ''Strassburg'', [[SMS Graudenz|''Graudenz'']], [[SMS Kolberg|''Kolberg'']], and ''Stralsund'' departed the Jade Estuary, bound for the English coast with the intent to lay minefields in British sea lanes. At 18:00, two dreadnought battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet departed to provide support. Hipper's force veered north in an arc to avoid [[Heligoland]] and the British submarines stationed there, and then increased speed to 18&nbsp;knots.<ref> Massie p310 </ref> At approximately 06:30 the following morning, Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British minesweeper ''Halcyon'', and opened fire, which drew the attention of the destroyer [[HMS Lively (1901)|''Lively'']]. Hipper realised that he was wasting time, and that further pursuit would run his ships into a known minefield, so he ordered his ships back to sea. As the flotilla was turning away, the battlecruisers fired several salvos at Yarmouth, to little effect. By the time the British Admiralty was fully aware of the situation, the German force had retreated back to home waters.

''Von der Tann'' also participated in the [[raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby]], on 15&ndash;16&nbsp;December.<ref name="Hore battleships" /> The raid was another attempt to lure out a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole of the High Seas Fleet standing by in support. ''Von der Tann'' delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth the I&nbsp;Scouting Group at anything less than full strength, and ''Von der Tann'' was undergoing routine repairs in early December.<ref name= "Strachan 428"> Strachan, p428</ref> The I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers ''Kolberg'', ''Strassburg'', ''Stralsund'', and ''Graudenz'', and two [[torpedo boat]] flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. <ref> Scheer, p68 </ref> Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef light vessel, at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast.<ref>Tarrant, p31</ref> The main battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet left in the late afternoon of the 15th. During the night of [[15 December]], the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers, and fearing the prospect of a night-time torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.

"d" shows the positioning of the British II Battle Squadron, and "e" denotes the location of Beatty's battlecruisers.]] 

Upon nearing the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. ''Seydlitz'', ''Moltke'', and ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' went north to shell Hartlpool, while ''Von der Tann'' and ''Derfflinger'' went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. The two ships destroyed the coast guard stations in both towns, along with the signalling station in Whitby. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and began to retreat eastward. <ref> Scheer, p70 </ref> Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's withdrawal, and following the bombardment of the target cities, turned back to rendezvous with the German fleet. By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper's chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted ''Stralsund'', and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however, they were some {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} ahead. The Harwich Force, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions.<ref>Beatty had intended on retaining only the two light cruisers from [[William Goodenough|Goodenough's]] squadron; however, [[HMS Nottingham (1913)|''Nottingham'']] misinterpreted the signal, thinking that it was intended for the whole squadron, and thus transmitted it to Goodenough.</ref> This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the north east of the British forces and made good their escape.

''Von der Tann'' was being refitted at the time of the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], and so she missed this action. She was replaced by the armoured cruiser ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'', which was sunk during the battle.<ref>Hawkins, p73 </ref> In 1915 the ship took part in operations in the North and Baltic Seas. On [[10 August]] [[1915]], ''Von der Tann'' shelled the island fortress at [[Ut<U+00F6>, Finland|Ut<U+00F6>]], in the eastern Baltic.<ref> Tucker, p180</ref> She also engaged the Russian armoured cruiser [[Russian cruiser Bayan|''Bayan'']] and five destroyers, during which action ''Von der Tann'' was struck by a shell through the funnel, which caused no casualties.<ref name= "Staff 10"> Staff, p10</ref> On 3&ndash;4&nbsp;February 1916, ''Von der Tann'' participated in the fleet advance to welcome home the commerce raider [[SMS M<U+00F6>we|''M<U+00F6>we'']]. The ship was also present during the fleet sorties of 5&ndash;7&nbsp;March, 17&nbsp;April, 21&ndash;22&nbsp;April, and 5&nbsp;May.<ref name="Hore battleships"> </ref>

====Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft====
''Von der Tann'' also took part in the [[Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft|bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]] on 24&ndash;25&nbsp;April. Hipper was away on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Konteradmiral [[Friedrich B<U+00F6>dicker]]. The German battlecruisers, ''Derfflinger'', ''L<U+00FC>tzow'', ''Moltke'', ''Seydlitz'' and ''Von der Tann'', left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24&nbsp;April, and were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas.<ref name= "Tarrant 52"> Tarrant, p52 </ref> The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for B<U+00F6>dicker's ships. The British [[Admiralty]] was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German [[wireless]] signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50. 

By 14:00, B<U+00F6>dicker's ships had reached a position off [[Norderney]], at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of [[Terschelling]]. At 15:38, ''Seydlitz'' struck a [[Naval mine|mine]], which tore a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube, which allowed {{convert|1400|t|ST|abbr=on}} of water to enter the ship.<ref name="Tarrant 52" /> ''Seydlitz'' turned back, with the screen of light cruisers, at a speed of 15 knots. The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, ''Seydlitz'' was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow B<U+00F6>dicker to disembark. The torpedo boat ''V28'' brought B<U+00F6>dicker to ''L<U+00FC>tzow''

At 04:50 on the 25th, the German battlecruisers were approaching Lowestoft when the light cruisers [[SMS Rostock|''Rostock'']] and [[SMS Elbing|''Elbing'']], which had been covering the southern flank, spotted the light cruisers and destroyers of Admiral [[Reginald Tyrwhitt|Tyrwhitt's]] [[Harwich Force]].<ref name="Tarrant 53"> Tarrant p53</ref> B<U+00F6>dicker refused to be distracted by the British ships, and instead trained his ships' guns on Lowestoft. The two {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} shore batteries were destroyed, along with other damage to the town. [[Captain at Sea|KzS]] Zenker, ''Von der Tann's'' commanding officer, later wrote:
<blockquote>
Mist over the sea and the smoke from the ships ahead made it difficult for us to make out our targets as we steered for Lowestoft. But after we turned [to the north], the Empire Hotel offered us an ample landmark for effective bombardment. At 05:11 we opened fire with our heavy and medium calibres on the harbour works and swing bridges. After a few "shorts" the shooting was good. From the after-bridge a fire in the town, and from another vantage point a great explosion at the entry [to the harbour] were reported.<ref name="Tarrant 53" />
</blockquote>

At 05:20, the German raiders turned north, towards Yarmouth, which they reached by 05:42. The visibility was so poor that the German ships fired one [[salvo]] each, with the exception of ''Derfflinger'', which fired fourteen rounds from her main battery. The German ships turned back south, and at 05:47, encountered the Harwich Force a second time, which had by then been engaged by the six light cruisers of the screening force. B<U+00F6>dicker's ships opened fire from a range of {{convert|13000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Tarrant 54">Tarrant, p54</ref> Tyrwhitt immediately turned his ships around and fled south, but not before the cruiser [[HMS Conquest (1915)|''Conquest'']] sustained severe damage. Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks, B<U+00F6>dicker broke off the chase, and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the Grand Fleet's sortie from Scapa Flow, turned back towards Germany. <ref name="Tarrant 54" />

====Battle of Jutland====
:''It should be noted that the times mentioned in this section are in [[Central European Time|CET]], which is congruent with the German perspective. This is one hour ahead of [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], which is the time zone commonly used in British works.''
[[Image:HMS Indefatigable sinking.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Indefatigable'' sinking after having been struck by shells from ''Von der Tann'']]
''Von der Tann'' participated in the [[Battle of Jutland]], as part of Hipper's First Scouting Group. ''Von der Tann'' was the rearmost of five battlecruisers in Hipper's line.<ref name="Bennett 183"> Bennett, p183</ref> Shortly before 1600&nbsp;hours, Hipper's force encountered Vice Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty's]] battlecruiser squadron. The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately {{convert|15000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Bennett 183" /> At 16:49, ''Von der Tann'' fired her first shot at [[HMS Indefatigable (1909)|HMS ''Indefatigable'']]. Fourteen minutes of firing later,<ref>Hough xiv</ref> ''Von der Tann'' had scored five hits on ''Indefatigable'' out of 52 heavy shells fired<ref name= "Staff 10"> </ref>, one of which caused ''Indefatigable'' to explode and sink.<ref name="Hore battleships" /> An observer on the battlecruiser [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|HMS ''New Zealand'']], which was directly ahead of ''Indefatigable'', later remarked that he saw:

<blockquote>
the ''Indefatigable'' hit by two shells from the ''Von der Tann'', one on the fore turret. Both appeared to explode on impact. Then there was an interval of thirty seconds; at the end the ship blew up. Sheets of flame were followed by dense smoke which obscured her from view.<ref> Bennett, p184<U+2013>5 </ref>
</blockquote>

Following the destruction of ''Indefatigable'', Beatty turned his force away, while the British 5th Battle Squadron closed in on the German battlecruisers, opening fire from approximately {{convert|19000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Bennet 185"> Bennett p185</ref> ''Von der Tann'' and ''Moltke'', the two rearmost of Hipper's squadron, came under fire from the three lead British battleships of the 5th BS: [[HMS Barham (04)|''Barham'']], [[HMS Valiant (1914)|''Valiant'']], and [[HMS Malaya (1915)|''Malaya'']].<ref> Massie, p594 </ref> The German battlecruisers began zig-zagging to avoid the gunfire from the British ships. At 17:09<ref name= "Staff 10"> </ref>, six minutes after sinking ''Indefatigable'', ''Von der Tann'' was hit by one {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} shell from ''Barham'', which struck beneath the waterline and dislodged a section of the belt armour, causing ''Von der Tann'' to take in 600&nbsp;tons of water.<ref name="Bennet 185" /> This hit temporarily damaged the ship's steering gear, and combined with ''Von der Tann's'' zig-zagging cause her to fall out of line to port. The German Official History commented that

<blockquote>
...the greatest calamity of a complete breakdown of the steering gear was averted, otherwise, ''Von der Tann'' would have been delivered into the hands of the oncoming battleships as in the case of  ''Bl<U+00FC>cher'' during the Dogger Bank action. <ref>Tarrant, p97</ref>
</blockquote>

''New Zealand'', which had been engaging ''Von der Tann'' following ''Indefatigable's'' destruction, lost sight of her target and shifted fire to ''Moltke''.<ref>Brooks, p244</ref> Shortly thereafter, ''Von der Tann'' registered a hit on ''Barham''.<ref> Brooks, p246 </ref> At 17:23, the ship was hit again by a {{convert|13.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} shell from [[HMS Tiger (1913)|HMS ''Tiger'']], which struck near the C&nbsp;turret. The C&nbsp;turret was temporarily disabled, and the starboard rudder engine room was damaged. Twenty-one minutes later, at 17:51, another {{convert|13.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} shell from ''Tiger'' struck the barbette of ''Von der Tann's'' A turret. A chunk of armour plate was dislodged from inside the turret, and struck the turret training gear, which jammed the turret at 120&nbsp;degrees. This put the turret out of action for the duration of the engagement. <ref> Tarrant, p99</ref>

At approximately 18:20, D turret failed, leaving the ship without any working main armament. Regardless, the ship remained in the battle line to distract the British gunners.<ref name= "Staff 10"> </ref> By 18:53, the ship's speed fell from {{convert|26|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} to {{convert|23|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}. Over an hour and a half after having failed due to mechanical difficulties, D&nbsp;turret was repaired and again ready for action. ''Von der Tann'' sustained her fourth and final heavy shell hit at 20:19, when one {{convert|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} shell from [[HMS Revenge (06)|HMS ''Revenge'']] struck the aft conning tower, putting it out of action. Eleven minutes later, at 20:30, B&nbsp;turret was again clear for action, and by 21:00, C&nbsp;turret was also in working order.<ref name="Staff 11"> Staff, p11 </ref>

During the course of the battle, two of her main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets suffered mechanical failures.<ref> Gardiner, Gray, and Budzbon, p152</ref> The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns became so overheated that they jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to working order.<ref>Massie p604</ref>''Von der Tann'' was without her main battery for 11 hours, although three turrets were restored to working order before the end of the battle;<ref> Staff, p10&ndash;11 </ref> D turret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches - afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded.<ref name="Staff 11" />  During the battle ''Von der Tann'' fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary calibre shells.<ref>Tarrant, p292</ref>

====Later actions====
After Jutland, she underwent repairs from [[2 June]] until [[29 July]].<ref name="Staff 11" /> After returning to the fleet, ''Von der Tann'' took part in several unsuccessful raids into the North Sea in 1916, including the advances on 18&ndash;19&nbsp;August, 25&ndash;26&nbsp;September, 18&ndash;19&nbsp;October, 23&ndash;24&nbsp;October, as well as the advance on 23&ndash;24&nbsp;March 1917.<ref name="Staff 11" /> 

[[Image:Glocke des BV im Marine-Ehrenmal in Laboe.jpg|thumb|right|''Von der Tann's'' bell, at the [[Laboe Naval Memorial]]]]
During the fleet advance on 18&ndash;19&nbsp;August, ''Von der Tann'' was one of two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition (along with ''Moltke''), so three dreadnoughts were assigned to the I&nbsp;Scouting Group for the operation: [[SMS Markgraf|''Markgraf'']], [[SMS Gro<U+00DF>er Kurf<U+00FC>rst (1913)|''Gro<U+00DF>er Kurf<U+00FC>rst'']], and [[SMS Bayern|''Bayern'']]. The I&nbsp;Scouting Group was to bombard the coastal town of [[Sunderland]], in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind, providing cover.<ref> Massie, p682 </ref> The British were aware of the German plans, and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.<ref> Massie, p683 </ref>

''Von der Tann'' served as the flagship of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter|von Reuter]] during the fleet advance to Norway on 23&ndash;25&nbsp;April 1918, as well as in the sortie on 8&ndash;9&nbsp;July.<ref name="Staff 11" />

===Fate===
''Von der Tann'' was to have taken part in what amounted to the "death ride" of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of the First World War. While the High Seas Fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war weary sailors began deserting en masse. As ''Von der Tann'' and [[SMS Derfflinger|''Derfflinger'']] passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven's inner harbour and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore.<ref> Massie, p775</ref>

The vessel was surrendered with the rest of the [[High Seas Fleet]] on [[24 November]] [[1918]] and interned at [[Scapa Flow]], under the command of ''Kapit<U+00E4>n-Leutnant'' Wollante.<ref>Reuter, p154</ref> Believing that the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had been signed and his fleet about to be seized by the British (both erroneous conclusions), Rear Admiral von Reuter ordered the scuttling of the High Seas Fleet on [[21 June]] [[1919]], while the British Grand Fleet was away on exercises.  The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes.<ref>Reuter, p153</ref> ''Von der Tann'' was raised on [[7 December]] [[1930]]<ref name="Staff 11" /> with some difficulty and scrapped at [[Rosyth]] between 1931 and 1934.<ref name="Hore battleships" />
