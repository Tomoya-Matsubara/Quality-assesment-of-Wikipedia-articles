'''Laurentia Tan Yen Yi''' ({{pronounced|l<U+0252><U+02E1>r<U+025B>n<U+0283><U+0259>}}, {{respelled|lo-<small>REN</small>-sh<U+0259>}}; {{zh-cp|c=<U+9648><U+96C1><U+4EEA>|p=Ch<U+00E9>n Y<U+00E0>ny<U+00ED>}}<U+FF0C>{{pronounced|t<U+0283><U+0259>n i<U+025B>n i}}, {{respelled|ch<U+0259>n yen yee}}) (born 24 April 1979) is a [[United Kingdom]]-based [[Singapore]]an [[equestrianism|equestrienne]]. Born with [[cerebral palsy]] and a profound [[hearing impairment]], Tan moved to the United Kingdom with her parents at the age of four. She took up horse riding at five years as a form of [[physiotherapy]]. She subsequently completed her [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] at the [[Mary Hare Grammar School]], a [[boarding school|residential]] [[special school]] for the deaf, and graduated with an honours degree from [[Oxford Brookes University]] in [[hospitality management]] and tourism.

In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at [[Hartpury College]] in [[Hartpury]], [[Gloucester]], in England in July that year. At this event, her first international competition, she did well enough to qualify for the 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the [[Hong Kong]] Olympic Equestrian Centre at [[Sha Tin]], she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class IA). These were Singapore's first Paralympic medals and Asia's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games. On 20 September 2008, Tan was conferred the ''[[Pingat Bakti Masyarakat]]'' (Public Service Medal) by the [[President of Singapore]].

==Early years and education==

==Sporting career==
In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) contacted Tan and invited her to join the Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships, which were a qualifier for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]].<ref name="BT 20080913">{{citation|author=Siow Li Sen|title=Grooming disabled riders|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sub/whatsin/story/0,4574,296779,00.html?|newspaper=[[Business Times]] (Singapore)|date=13 September 2008}}.</ref> The event, Tan's first international competition, was held at [[Hartpury College]] in [[Hartpury]], [[Gloucester]], in England from 18 to 22 July 2007. She achieved 63% or higher in both her Team and Individual Tests, qualifying her to be selected for the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]]. In the Freestyle to Music Test, she was placed fourth in a field of 18&nbsp;riders with a best score of 67.94%.<ref>{{citation|title=Dressage rider Laurentia Tan qualifies for the 2008 Hong Kong Para Olympics &#91;sic&#93;!|url=http://www.rdasingapore.org/?p=15|publisher=Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore|date=22 August 2007|accessdate=2008-09-11}}.</ref>

===2008 Summer Paralympics===
In October 2007, Tan came to Singapore to train daily at RDA with volunteer coach Sally Drummond, who later went to the United Kingdom in April 2008 for two weeks to help her in her [[Paralympic Games|Paralympic]] d<U+00E9>but.<ref name="BT 20080913"/> Tan also resigned her job in June 2008 to train full-time with her coach Penny Pegrum and overcome muscle [[spasticity]].<ref name="Today 20080912"/><ref name="ST 20080910"/> Her first event was the para-[[dressage]] Individual Championship Test (grade IA). Riders in this event are categorized into grades I to IV, those in grade I having the most severe disabilities. On 9 September, riding a 20-year-old [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] [[gelding]] loaned to her named Nothing to Lose (also known as Harvey) at the [[Hong Kong]] Olympic Equestrian Centre in [[Sha Tin]], Tan scored 68.80% to claim the [[bronze medal]] behind the United Kingdom's Anne Dunham (73.10%) and Sophie Christiansen (72.80%). She thus became the first Singaporean to win a Paralympic medal, and the holder of Asia's first Paralympic equestrian medal. She will also receive [[Singapore dollar|S$]]25,000 from the Singapore National Paralympic Council's Athletes Achievement Awards scheme.<ref name="ST 20080910"/><ref>{{citation|title=Roundup: British, German riders become biggest winners in Para-equestrian Freestyle|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/12/content_9935260.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 September 2008}}; {{citation|title=First Paralympian for Singapore emerges today <U+2013> Laurentia Tan|url=http://www.sdsc.org.sg/news_and_media/media_detail/595/|publisher=Singapore Disability Sports Council|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=2008-09-13}}; {{citation|author=Low Lin Fhoong|title=Tan aims for No 2: One bronze in the bag, equestrian ace could taste more glory today|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275268.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=11 September 2008|page=49}} (archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5bF4lqmNw).

Two days after achieving the first medal, Tan collected her second bronze with a score of 70.167% for the Individual Freestyle Event, in which she and her horse performed to music.<ref name="ST 20080912">{{citation|author=Jeanette Wang|title=Bronze once again: Tan can't hear must but she and horse 'dance' their way to 2nd medal|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Sport)|date=12 September 2008|page=B21}}.</ref> The president of the Equestrian Federation of Singapore, Melanie Chew, described her performance as "beyond our expectations", and that the wins would aid in promoting local awareness of the sport.<ref>{{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Paralympics: Singapore's Laurentia Tan wins second Equestrian bronze|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/375273/1/.html|newspaper=[[Channel NewsAsia]]|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref>

Tan's win sparked discussion about the recognition given to Paralympians in Singapore. A correspondent to the ''[[The Straits Times|Straits Times]]'' criticized the fact that the newspaper had not elaborated on Tan's performance or what was involved in the event, but had "focused almost primarily on her disability".<ref>{{citation|author=Liang Kaicheng|title=So proud, but why focus on disability?|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Forum)|date=12 September 2008}}.</ref> Another letter writer to ''[[my paper]]'' expressed disappointment that less publicity had been given to Tan's achievement compared to the silver medals won by the [[Singapore at the 2008 Summer Olympics|Singapore women's table tennis team]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref>{{citation|author=Yong Ming Han|title=Why so little attention paid to Paralympic bronze?|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Mailbox/Story/A1Story20080912-87350.html|newspaper=[[my paper]] (reproduced at AsiaOne)|date=12 September 2008|page=A28}}.

He felt that she should receive even more than them, given what she had achieved in spite of her disabilities.<ref>{{citation|author=Chua Sin Bin|title=She deserves even more|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/275473.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=12 September 2008|page=38}} (archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5bF5E8A4i).</ref> The President of the Society for the Physically Disabled commented that the disparity between the cash awards given to able-bodied and disabled sportspeople was "disconcerting" and looked forward to a single common scheme, because:

{{quote|If we persist in having two different standards, we reinforce the erroneous perception that disabled people are different, and strengthen the barriers against building an inclusive society. We cannot build a gracious inclusive society if we continue to deny the achievements of those perceived to be different and less able than we.<ref>{{citation|author=Chia Yong Yong|title=Offer them equal treatment|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] (Forum)|date=17 September 2008|page=A23}}.

On 16 September, [[Nominated Member of Parliament]] [[Eunice Olsen]] asked in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] if there was a difference in the amount of funding given to Olympians and Paralympians, and why Paralympians receive a much smaller cash reward for medals won compared to Olympians. [[Teo Ser Luck]], Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Community Development, Youth and Sports), said that on a ''[[per capita]]'' basis disabled sportspeople received about S$106,000 in the current financial year compared to $54,000 for each able-bodied sportsperson as there were 794&nbsp;registered able-bodied sportspeople but only 16&nbsp;disabled ones. Teo attributed the disparity in the cash rewards to the fact that Olympians faced higher levels and a larger scale of competition, since disabled sportspeople compete within disability classes. Further, cash rewards were provided by the private sector and Singapore Totalisator Board and were not paid out of state funds. The scheme for Olympians had also been in place for a number of years, while cash rewards for Paralympians were only introduced recently.<ref>{{citation|author=Jeremy Au Yong|title=Top disabled athletes get far more funding|newspaper=[[The Straits Times]]|date=17 September 2008|page=B9}}.</ref><ref name="Today 20080917">{{citation|author=Tan Yo-Hinn|title=Paralympic hopefuls in line for more support|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/276353.asp|newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|date=17 September 2008|page=43}} (archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5bF5RWJcu).
