In the [[history of astronomy]], '''Islamic astronomy''' or '''Arabic astronomy''' refers to the [[astronomical]] developments made in the [[Islamic world]], particularly during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th<U+2013>15th centuries),<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Harv|Saliba|1994b|pp=245, 250, 256<U+2013>257}}</ref> and mostly written in the [[Arabic language]]. These developments mostly took place in the [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]], [[Al-Andalus]], and [[North Africa]], and later in the [[Far East]] and [[History of India|India]]. It closely parallels the genesis of other [[Islamic science]]s in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science with [[Islam]]ic characteristics.

A significant number of [[star]]s in the [[sky]], such as [[Aldebaran]] and [[Altair]], and astronomical terms such as [[alhidade]], [[azimuth]], and [[almucantar]], are still referred to by [[List of Arabic star names|their Arabic names]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icoproject.org/star.html|title=Arabic Star Names|date=2007-05-01|accessdate=2008-01-24|publisher=Islamic Crescents' Observation Project}}</ref> A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, many of which have not been read or catalogued.

==Islam and astronomy==
[[Islam]] has affected astronomy directly and indirectly. A major impetus for the flowering of astronomy in Islam came from religious observances, which presented an assortment of problems in mathematical astronomy, specifically in [[spherical geometry]].<ref name=Gingerich/>

===Background===
In the 7th century, both [[Christian]]s and [[Jew]]s observed holy days, such as [[Easter]] and [[Passover]], whose timing was determined by the [[phases of the moon]]. Both communities had confronted the fact that the approximately 29.5-day lunar months are not commensurable with the 365-day [[solar year]]. To solve the problem, Christians and Jews had adopted a scheme based on a discovery made in ''circa'' 430 BC by the [[Athenian]] astronomer [[Meton]]. In the 19-year [[Metonic cycle]], there were 12 years of 12 lunar months and seven years of 13 lunar months. The periodic insertion of a 13th month kept calendar dates in step with the seasons.<ref name=Gingerich/>

On the other hand, [[astronomer]]s used [[Ptolemy]]'s way to calculate the place of the [[moon]] and [[star]]s. The method Ptolemy used to solve [[spherical triangle]]s was a clumsy one devised late in the 1st century by [[Menelaus of Alexandria]]. It involved setting up two intersecting [[right triangle]]s; by applying [[Menelaus' theorem]] it was possible to solve one of the six sides, but only if the other five sides were known. To tell the time from the [[sun]]'s [[altitude]], for instance, repeated applications of Menelaus' theorem were required. For medieval Islamic astronomers, there was an obvious challenge to find a simpler [[trigonometric]] method.<ref name=Gingerich/>

===Islamic attitude towards astronomy===
{{See also|Islamic cosmology}}

Islam advised [[Muslim]]s to find ways of using the stars. The [[Qur'an]] says: "And it is He who ordained the stars for you that you may be guided thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea."<ref>{{cite quran|6|97|style=ref}}</ref> On the basis of this advice Muslims began to develop better observational and navigational instruments, thus most [[navigational stars]] today have Arabic names.<ref name=Gingerich/>

Other influences of the Qur'an on Islamic astronomy included its "insistence that the Universe is ruled by a single [[Physical law|set of laws]]" which was "rooted in the Islamic concept of ''[[Tawhid|tawh<U+00EE>d]]'', the unity of God", as well its "greater respect for [[empirical]] [[data]] than was common in the preceding Greek civilization" which inspired Muslims to place a greater emphasis on empirical [[observation]],<ref>{{citation|first=I. A.|last=Ahmad|title=The impact of the Qur'anic conception of astronomical phenomena on Islamic civilization|journal=Vistas in Astronomy|volume=39|issue=4|year=1995|pages=395<U+2013>403|doi=10.1016/0083-6656(95)00033-X}}</ref> in contrast to ancient [[Greek philosophers]] such as the [[Platonists]] who expressed a general distrust towards the [[sense]]s and instead viewed [[reason]] alone as being sufficient to understanding nature. The Qur'an's insistence on observation, reason and [[contemplation]] ("see", "think" and "contemplate"), on the other hand, led Muslims to develop an early [[scientific method]] based on these principles, particularly empirical observation. [[Muhammad Iqbal]] writes:<ref>{{citation|first=I. A.|last=Ahmad|contribution=The Rise and Fall of Islamic Science: The Calendar as a Case Study|title=Faith and Reason: Convergence and Complementarity|publisher=[[Al Akhawayn University]]|date=June 3, 2002|url=http://images.agustianwar.multiply.com/attachment/0/RxbYbQoKCr4AAD@kzFY1/IslamicCalendar-A-Case-Study.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref>

{{quote|<U+201C>The general empirical attitude of the Qur'an which engendered in its followers a feeling of reverence for the actual, and ultimately made them the founders of modern science. It was a great point to awaken the empirical spirit in an age that renounced the visible as of no value in men's search after God.<U+201D>}}

Several [[hadith]]s attributed to [[Muhammad]] also show that he was generally [[Muslim views on astrology|opposed to astrology]] as well as [[superstition]] in general. An example of this is when an [[eclipse]] occurred during his son [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad]]'s death, and rumours began spreading about this being God's personal condolence. Muhammad is said to have replied:<ref>{{citation|first=James A.|last=Michene|title=Islam: The Misunderstood Religion|journal=[[Reader's Digest]]|date=May 1955|pages=68<U+2013>70}}</ref>

<blockquote>"An eclipse is a phenomenon of nature & has no relation to the death or birth of a human being."</blockquote>

From the 12th century onwards, Islamic astronomy began becoming a science primarily dependant upon observation rather than philosophy, primarily due to religious opposition from [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologians]] of the [[Ash'ari]] school, most prominently [[Al-Ghazali]], who opposed the interference of [[Aristotelian physics]] and [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian cosmology]] in astronomy, opening up possibilities for an astronomy unrestrained by [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy.<ref name=Ragep/><ref name=Ragep2/> For example, the Ash'ari doctrine influenced the theologian [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (1149<U+2013>1209) to reject the Aristotelian notion of the [[Geocentric model|Earth's centrality]] within the [[universe]] and instead propose the notion of a [[multiverse]] consisting of countless [[world]]s and universes, "such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has." Al-Razi also criticized the Aristotelian notion of solid [[celestial spheres]] and suggested these may be "merely the abstract orbit traced by the stars."<ref name=Setia/> Later in the century, the [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologian]] Adud al-Din al-Iji (1281<U+2013>1355), under the influence of the [[Ash'ari]] doctrine of [[occasionalism]], which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God's will, rejected the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian principle]] of an innate principle of circular motion in the heavenly bodies,<ref name=Huff-175>{{Harv|Huff|2003|p=175}}</ref> and maintained that the celestial spheres were "imaginary things" and "more tenuous than a spider's web".<ref name=Ragep2/> Under such influences, [[Ali Qushji]] (d. 1474) rejected Aristotelian physics and completely separated it from astronomy, allowing astronomy to become a purely [[empirical]] and mathematical science. This allowed him to explore alternatives to the Aristotelian notion of a stationery Earth, as he explored the idea of a [[Earth's rotation|moving Earth]]. He concluded, on the basis of empirical evidence rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory and that it is not possible to empirically deduce which theory is true (see ''[[#Astronomical physics and Earth's motion|Astronomical physics and Earth's motion]]'' section below).<ref name=Ragep/><ref name=Ragep2/>

===Islamic rules===
[[File:Irakischer Maler von 1287 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arabic language|Arabic]] [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] from the 12th century [[Common Era|CE]] showing various historical figures and [[scholars]] in medieval [[Islam]]]]
There are several rules in Islam which lead Muslims to use better astronomical calculations and [[observation]]s.

The first issue is the [[Islamic calendar]]. The [[Qur'an]] says: "The number of months in the sight of Allah is twelve (in a year) so ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred; that is the straight usage."<ref name=Gingerich/><ref>{{cite quran|9|36|style=ref}}</ref> Therefore Muslims could not follow the [[Liturgical year|Christian]] or [[Hebrew calendar]]s and they thus had to develop a new one.

The other issue is moon sighting. Islamic months do not begin at the astronomical [[new moon]], defined as the time when the moon has the same [[celestial longitude]] as the sun and is therefore invisible; instead they begin when the thin [[crescent moon]] is first sighted in the western evening sky.<ref name=Gingerich/> The Qur'an says: "They ask you about the waxing and waning phases of the crescent moons, say they are to mark fixed times for mankind and [[Hajj]]."<ref>{{cite quran|2|189|style=ref}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://www.almizan.org/Tafseer/Volume3/Baqarah47.asp|chapter=Volume 3: Surah Baqarah, Verse 189|author=Syed Mohammad Hussain Tabatabai|title=Tafsir al-Mizan|accessdate=2008-01-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
This led Muslims to find the phases of the moon in the sky, and their efforts led to new mathematical calculations and observational instruments, as well as a special science being formed specifically for moon sighting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chowk.com/site/articles/index.php?id=4026|title=The Science of Moon Sighting|author=Khalid Shaukat|date= September 23, 1997|accessdate=2008-01-24}}</ref>

Muslims are also expected to pray towards the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]] and orient their [[mosque]]s in that direction. Thus they need to determine the direction of Mecca from a given location.<ref>{{cite quran|2|144|style=ref}}</ref><ref>{{cite quran|2|150|style=ref}}</ref> Another influencing factor is the [[Salat times|time of Salah]]. Muslims need to determine from [[celestial bodies]] the proper times for the prayers at [[sunrise]], at [[Noon|midday]], in the [[afternoon]], at [[sunset]], and in the [[evening]].<ref name=Gingerich/><ref name=Tabatabai>{{citation|url=http://www.almizan.org/Tafseer/Volume2/Baqarah32.asp|author=Syed Mohammad Hussain Tabatabai|work=Tafsir al-Mizan|chapter=Volume 2: Surah Baqarah, Verses 142<U+2013>151|accessdate=2008-01-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

===Necessity of spherical geometry===
{{See also|Islamic mathematics}}
[[File:Lunar eclipse al-Biruni.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[al-Biruni]]'s [[Persian language|Persian]] book. It shows different [[phases of the moon]].]]

Predicting just when the crescent moon would become visible is a special challenge to Islamic mathematical astronomers. Although [[Ptolemy]]'s theory of the complex lunar motion was tolerably accurate near the time of the new moon, it specified the moon's path only with respect to the [[ecliptic]]. To predict the first visibility of the moon, it was necessary to describe its motion with respect to the [[horizon]], and this problem demands a more sophisticated [[spherical geometry]].<ref>''The history of the telescope'' Henry C. King, Harold Spencer Jones, Courier Dover Publications, 2003 ISBN	0486432653, 9780486432656</ref> Finding the direction of [[Mecca]] and the time of [[Salah]] are the reasons which led to Muslims making advances in spherical geometry. Solving any of these problems involves finding the unknown sides or angles of a triangle on the [[celestial sphere]] from the known sides and angles. A way of finding the time of day, for example, is to construct a triangle whose [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] are the [[zenith]], the north [[celestial pole]], and the sun's position. The observer must know the altitude of the sun and that of the pole; the former can be observed, and the latter is equal to the observer's [[latitude]]. The time is then given by the angle at the intersection of the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] (the [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] through the zenith and the pole) and the sun's [[hour circle]] (the arc through the sun and the pole).<ref name=Gingerich/><ref name=Tabatabai/>

==History==
[[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]n knowledge of [[star]]s was [[empirical]]; their knowledge was what they observed regarding the rising and setting of stars. The rise of [[Islam]] is claimed to have provoked increased [[Arab]] thought in this field.<ref name=Dallal162>{{Harv|Dallal|1999|p=162}}</ref> The foundations of Islamic astronomy closely parallel the genesis of other Islamic sciences in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science that was essentially Islamic. These include [[Indian astronomy|Indian]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] works which were [[translation|translated]] and built upon.

The science historian [[Donald Routledge Hill]] has divided the history of Islamic astronomy into the four following distinct time periods in its history:<ref name=Dallal162/>
*Assimilation and [[syncretism|syncretization]] of earlier Hellenistic, Indian and Sassanid astronomy (700<U+2014>825 [[Anno Domini|AD]])
*Vigorous investigation, and acceptance and modification to the [[Ptolemaic system]] (825<U+2014>1025 [[Anno Domini|AD]])
*Flourishing of a distinctive Islamic system of astronomy (1025<U+2014>1450 [[Anno Domini|AD]])
*Stagnation, where few significant contributions were made (1450<U+2014>1900 [[Anno Domini|AD]])

===610<U+2013>700===
From the beginning, Muslim community in Medina sight [[new moon]] to determine the lunar months especially Ramadan and holy days.

In approximately 638 A.D, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] introduced a new [[lunar calendar]] based on the Islamic viewpoint. This calendar has twelve lunar months, the beginnings of which are determined by the sighting of the crescent moon. This calendar is about 11 days shorter than the solar year. This calendar is still in use for religious purposes among Muslims.<ref name=Gingerich/><ref>[http://islam.about.com/cs/calendar/a/hijrah_calendar.htm What is the Hijrah Calendar?]</ref>

===700<U+2013>825===
This period was most notably the period of assimilation and syncretization of earlier Hellenistic, Indian and Sassanid astronomy occurred during the 8th and early 9th centuries.

====Impetus====
Historians point out several factors that fostered the growth of Islamic astronomy. The first was the proximity of the [[Muslim world]] to the world of ancient learning. Much of the ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Middle Persian]] texts were translated into [[Arabic]] during the 9th century. This process was enhanced by the tolerance towards scholars of other religions.<ref name=Gingerich>{{Harv|Gingerich|1986}}</ref>

Another impetus came from Islamic religious observances, which presented a host of problems in mathematical astronomy. In solving these religious problems the Islamic scholars went far beyond the Greek mathematical methods.<ref name=Gingerich/>

====Ancient influences and translation movement====
During this period, a number of [[Sanskrit]] and [[Middle Persian]] texts were first translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The most notable of the texts was ''[[Zij|Zij al-Sindhind]]'',<ref>This book is not related to al-Khwarizmi's ''Zij al-Sindh''. On ''zijes'', see {{Harv|Kennedy|1956}}</ref> based on the ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' and the works of [[Brahmagupta]], and translated by [[Muhammad al-Fazari]] and [[Yaq<U+016B>b ibn T<U+0101>riq]] in 777. Sources indicate that the text was translated after an [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]] visited the court of [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in 770. The most notable Middle Persian text translated was the ''Zij al-Shah'', a collection of astronomical tables compiled in Sassanid Persia over two centuries.

Fragments of text during this period indicate that Arabs adopted the [[Trigonometric function|sine function]] (inherited from [[Indian mathematics|Indian trigonometry]]) instead of the [[chord (geometry)|chord]]s of [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] used in Hellenistic mathematics.<ref name=Dallal162/> Another Indian influence was an approximate formula used for [[time]]keeping by Muslim astronomers.<ref>{{Harv|King|2002|p=240}}</ref>

[[File:Almagest.jpg|thumb|A page from Ptolemy's ''Almagest''.]]
Islamic interest in [[astronomy]] ran parallel to the interest in mathematics. Especially noteworthy in this regard was the ''[[Almagest]]'' (c. 150) of the astronomer [[Ptolemy]] (c. 100<U+2013>178). The ''Almagest'' was a landmark work in its field, assembling, as [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' had previously done with geometrical works, all extant knowledge in the field of astronomy that was known to the author. This work was originally known as ''The Mathematical Composition'', but after it had come to be used as a text in astronomy, it was called ''The Great Astronomer''. The Islamic world called it ''The Greatest'' prefixing the Greek work ''megiste'' (greatest) with the article ''al-'' and it has since been known to the world as ''Al-megiste'' or, after popular use in [[Western world|Western]] translation, ''Almagest''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Greek Astronomy|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_astro.html |accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> though much of the ''Almagest'' was incorrect, even in premise, it remained a standard astronomical text in both the Islamic world and [[Europe]] until the [[#Maragha Revolution|Maragha Revolution]] and [[Copernican Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/Almagest.html|title=Almagest|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref> Ptolemy also produced other works, such as ''Optics'', ''[[Harmonica]]'', and some suggest he also wrote ''Tetrabiblon''.

The ''Almagest'' was a particularly unifying work for its exhaustive lists of astronomical phenomena. He drew up a list of chronological tables of [[Assyria]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] kings for use in reckoning the lapse of time between known astronomical events and fixed dates. In addition to its relevance to calculating accurate calendars, it linked far and foreign cultures together by a common interest in the stars and astrology. The work of Ptolemy was replicated and refined over the years under [[Arab]], [[Persian people|Persian]] and other [[Muslim]] astronomers and astrologers.

===825<U+2013>1025===
The period throughout the 9th, 10th and early 11th centuries was one of vigorous investigation, in which the superiority of the [[Ptolemaic system]] of astronomy was accepted and significant contributions made to it. Astronomical research was greatly supported by the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Mamun]]. [[Baghdad]] and [[Damascus]] became the centers of such activity. The caliphs not only supported this work [[financial]]ly, but endowed the work with formal prestige.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Sinan|title=Abu Said Sinan ibn Thabit ibn Qurra|date=November 1999|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

====Early observational astronomy====
[[File:Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Musa al-Khwarizmi.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>|Al-Khwarizmi]], the father of [[algebra]] and [[algorithm]]s and a Persian Astronomer, wrote the ''Zij al-Sindh'', the first original [[Zij]] in Islamic astronomy.]]

In [[observational astronomy]], the first major original Muslim work of astronomy was ''Zij al-Sindh'' by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>|al-Khwarizimi]] in 830. The work contains tables for the movements of the sun, the moon and the five planets known at the time. The work is significant as it introduced Indian and Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic sciences. This work also marked the turning point in Islamic astronomy. Hitherto, Muslim astronomers had adopted a primarily research approach to the field, translating works of others and learning already discovered knowledge. Al-Khwarizmi's work marked the beginning of non-traditional methods of study and calculations.<ref>{{Harv|Dallal|1999|p=163}}</ref>

Between 825 to 835, [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]] conducted various observations at the Al-Shammisiyyah [[observatory]] in Baghdad, where he estimated a number of geographic and astronomical values.<ref name=Langermann>{{citation|title=The Book of Bodies and Distances of Habash al-Hasib|last=Langermann|first=Y. Tzvi|journal=[[Centaurus (journal)|Centaurus]]|year=1985|volume=28|pages=108<U+2013>128 [112]|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1985.tb00831.x}}</ref> He compiled his results in ''The Book of Bodies and Distances'', in which many of his estimates come closer to modern values than any of his predecessors. For example, he estimated the Moon's diameter as 3,037&nbsp;km (equivalent to 1,519&nbsp;km radius) and its distance from the Earth as 215,209 miles, which come close to the currently accepted values of 1,735&nbsp;km radius and 238,857 miles distance, respectively.<ref>{{citation|title=The Book of Bodies and Distances of Habash al-Hasib|last=Langermann|first=Y.

In 850, [[Alfraganus|al-Farghani]] wrote ''Kitab fi Jawani'' ("''A compendium of the science of stars''"). The book primarily gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography. However, it also corrected Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' based on findings of earlier Iranian astronomers. Al-Farghani gave revised values for the [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the [[ecliptic]], the [[precession]]al movement of the [[apogee]]s of the sun and the moon, and the circumference of the earth. The books were widely circulated through the Muslim world, and even translated into [[Latin]].<ref>{{Harv|Dallal|1999|p=164}}</ref>

[[Muhammad ibn J<U+0101>bir al-Harr<U+0101>n<U+012B> al-Batt<U+0101>n<U+012B>]] (Albatenius) (853<U+2013>929) produced "improved tables of the orbits of the sun and the moon" that "contained his great discovery that the direction of the sun's [[Orbital eccentricity|excentric]] ... , as recorded by Ptolemy, was changing."<ref>{{Harv|Singer|1959|p=151}}</ref> Among other things, he worked on timing the first appearance of the moon's crescent following a [[new moon]], the lengths of the [[solar year|solar]] and [[sidereal year|sidereal]] years, the prediction of [[eclipse]]s, and the phenomenon of [[parallax]].<ref>{{Harv|Wickens|1976|pp=[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=jhwV3qLrmmUC&pg=PA117 117<U+2013>18]}}</ref> Around the same time, Yahya Ibn Abi Mansour carried out extensive observations and tests, and wrote the ''Al-[[Zij]] al-Mumtahan'', in which he completely revised the ''Almagest'' values.<ref>{{citation|title=23rd Annual Conference on the History of Arabic Science|date=October 2001|publisher=[[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]}} ([[cf.]] {{Harv|Zaimeche|2002}})</ref>

In 1006, the [[Egypt]]ian astronomer [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] observed [[SN 1006]], the brightest [[supernova]] in recorded history, and left a detailed description of the temporary star. He says that the object was two to three times as large as the disc of [[Venus]] and about one-quarter the brightness of the [[Moon]], and that the star was low on the southern horizon.

====Universal cosmology====
{{Main|Islamic cosmology}}
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

In contrast to ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] who believed that the [[universe]] had an infinite past with no beginning, [[Medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] and [[Theology|theologians]] developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning (see [[Temporal finitism]]). This view was inspired by the [[creation myth]] shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the first such argument against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past. His arguments were adopted by many most notably; [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Islamic theology|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel). They used two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the "argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite", which states:<ref name=Craig>{{citation|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165<U+2013>170 [165<U+2013>6]|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165}}</ref>

:"An actual infinite cannot exist."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite."
:"An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist."

The second argument, the "argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition", states:<ref name=Craig/>

:"An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition."
:"The temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite."

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became more famous after it was adopted by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his thesis of the first antimony concerning [[time]].<ref name=Craig/>

====Physical cosmology====
[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mustansiriya University]] in [[Baghdad]] (the minaret in the background was used for astronomical purposes)]]
In the 9th century, the eldest [[Ban<U+016B> M<U+016B>s<U+0101>]] brother, [[Ja'far Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> ibn Sh<U+0101>kir]], made significant contributions to [[Islamic physics|astrophysics]] and [[celestial mechanics]]. He was the first to hypothesize that the heavenly bodies and [[celestial spheres]] are subject to the same [[Physical law|laws of physics]] as [[Earth]], unlike the ancients who believed that the celestial spheres followed their own set of physical laws different from that of Earth.<ref>{{Harv|Saliba|1994a|p=116}}</ref> 
In the 10th century, [[Muhammad ibn J<U+0101>bir al-Harr<U+0101>n<U+012B> al-Batt<U+0101>n<U+012B>]] (Albatenius) (853<U+2013>929) introduced the idea of [[Experiment|testing]] "past observations by means of new ones".<ref>{{Harv|Huff|2003|p=57}}</ref> This led to the use of exacting [[empirical]] observations and experimental techniques by Muslim astronomers from the 11th century onwards.<ref>{{Harv|Huff|2003|p=326}}</ref>

In the early 11th century, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) wrote the ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'') some time before 1021. This was the first attempt successful at combining mathematical astronomy with [[physics]] and the earliest attempt at applying the [[Scientific method|experimental method]] to astronomy and [[astrophysics]]. He disproved the universally held opinion that the [[moon]] reflects [[sunlight]] like a [[mirror]] and correctly concluded that it "emits light from those portions of its surface which the [[sun]]'s light strikes." In order to prove that "light is emitted from every point of the moon's illuminated surface," he built an "ingenious [[experiment]]al device." Ibn al-Haytham had "formulated a clear conception of the relationship between an ideal mathematical model and the complex of observable phenomena; in particular, he was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the [[radiance|intensity]] of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[aperture]]s onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up."<ref name=Toomer>{{citation|first=G.

Ibn al-Haytham, in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021), also maintained that the [[celestial spheres]] do not consist of [[solid]] matter, and that the heavens are less dense than the air. These views were later repeated by [[Witelo]] and had a significant influence on the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] and [[Tychonic system]]s of astronomy.<ref>{{Harv|Rosen|1985|pp=19<U+2013>20 & 21}}</ref>

Ibn al-Haytham also refuted [[Aristotle]]'s view on the Milky Way galaxy. Aristotle believed the Milky Way to be caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition takes place in the upper part of the [[atmosphere]], in the [[Sublunary sphere|region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions]]."<ref name=Montada>{{cite web|author=Josep Puig Montada|title=Ibn Bajja|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-bajja|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> Ibn al-Haytham refuted this by making the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's [[parallax]],<ref>{{citation|title=Great Muslim Mathematicians|first=Mohaini|last=Mohamed|year=2000|publisher=Penerbit UTM|isbn=9835201579|pages=49<U+2013>50}}</ref> and he thus "determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it was very remote from the [[earth]] and did not belong to the atmosphere."<ref>{{cite web|title=Popularisation of Optical Phenomena: Establishing the First Ibn Al-Haytham Workshop on Photography|author=Hamid-Eddine Bouali, Mourad Zghal, Zohra Ben Lakhdar|publisher=The Education and Training in Optics and Photonics Conference|year=2005|url=http://spie.org/etop/ETOP2005_080.pdf|accessdate=2008-07-08|format=PDF}}</ref>

===1025<U+2013>1450===
During this period, a distinctive Islamic system of astronomy flourished. It was Greek tradition to separate mathematical astronomy (as typified by [[Ptolemy]]) from philosophical cosmology (as typified by [[Aristotle]]). Muslim scholars developed a program of seeking a physically real configuration (''hay'a'') of the universe, that would be consistent with both [[mathematics|mathematical]] and [[physics|physical]] principles. Within the context of this ''hay'a'' tradition, Muslim astronomers began questioning technical details of the [[Ptolemaic system]] of astronomy.<ref>{{Harv|Sabra|1998|pp=293<U+2013>8}}</ref> Most of these criticisms, however, continued to follow the Ptolemaic astronomical [[paradigm]], remaining within the [[geocentrism|geocentric]] framework.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dennis Duke|url=http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/arabmars.html|title=Arabic Models for outer Planets and Venus|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> As the historian of astronomy, [[A. I. Sabra]], noted:

{{quote|"All Islamic astronomers from [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] in the ninth century to [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the fourteenth, and all natural philosophers from [[al-Kindi]] to [[Averroes]] and later, are known to have accepted what Kuhn has called the "[[Two Sphere Universe|two-sphere universe]]" ...<U+2014>the Greek picture of the world as consisting of two spheres of which one, the [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]] made up of a special element called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], concentrically envelops the other, where the [[classical elements|four elements]] of earth, water, air, and fire reside."<ref>{{Harv|Sabra|1998|pp=317<U+2013>18}}</ref>}}

Some Muslim astronomers, however, most notably [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] and [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]], discussed whether the Earth moved and considered how this might be consistent with astronomical computations and physical systems.<ref>{{Harv|Ragep|Teresi|Hart|2002}}</ref> Several other Muslim astronomers, most notably those following the [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha school]] of astronomy, developed non-Ptolemaic planetary models within a geocentric context that were later adapted by the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] in a [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] context.

====Refutations of astrology====
{{See also|Islamic astrology}}

The study of astrology was refuted by several Muslim writers, including [[al-Farabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>|Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] and [[Averroes]]. Their reasons for refuting astrology were often due to both scientific (the methods used by astrologers being [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]]) and religious (conflicts with orthodox [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]]) reasons.<ref>{{Harv|Saliba|1994b|pp=60 & 67<U+2013>69}}</ref>

[[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] (1292<U+2013>1350), in his ''Miftah Dar al-SaCadah'', used [[empirical]] arguments in astronomy in order to refute the practice of astrology and [[divination]].<ref>{{citation|title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation|first=John W.|last=Livingston|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=91|issue=1|year=1971|pages=96<U+2013>103|doi=10.2307/600445|url=http://jstor.org/stable/600445|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 91, No. 1}}</ref> He recognized that the [[star]]s are much larger than the [[planet]]s, and that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] is the smallest planet known to them, and thus argued:<ref name=Livingston>{{citation|title=Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: A Fourteenth Century Defense against Astrological Divination and Alchemical Transmutation|first=John W.|last=Livingston|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=91|issue=1|year=1971|pages=96<U+2013>103 [99]|doi=10.2307/600445|url=http://jstor.org/stable/600445|publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 91, No. 1}}</ref>

{{quote|"And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?"}}

Al-Jawziyya also recognized the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] as "a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars" and thus argued that "it is certainly impossible to have knowledge of their influences."<ref name=Livingston/>

====Astrophysics and celestial mechanics====
In [[astrophysics]] and [[celestial mechanics]], [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] described the Earth's [[gravitation]] as:
{{quote|"The attraction of all things towards the centre of the earth."}}

Al-Biruni also discovered that gravity exists within the [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] and [[celestial spheres]], and he criticized the [[Aristotelian theory of gravity|Aristotelian]] views of them not having any [[Aristotelian_theory_of_gravity#Gravity|levity or gravity]] and of [[circular motion]] being an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate property]] of the heavenly bodies.<ref>{{Harv|Iqbal|Berjak|2003}}</ref>

Also in the 12th century, [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] participated in the debate among Islamic scholars over whether the [[celestial spheres]] or orbits (''falak'') are "to be considered as real, concrete physical bodies" or "merely the abstract circles in the heavens traced out year in and year out by the various stars and planets." He points out that many astronomers prefer to see them as solid spheres "on which the stars turn," while others, such as the Islamic scholar Dahhak, view the celestial sphere as "not a body but merely the abstract orbit traced by the stars." Al-Razi himself remains "undecided as to which [[Celestial mechanics|celestial models]], concrete or abstract, most conform with external reality," and notes that "there is no way to ascertain the characteristics of the heavens," whether by "observable" evidence or by authority (''al-khabar'') of "[[Qur'an|divine revelation]] or [[Sunnah|prophetic traditions]]." He concludes that "astronomical models, whatever their utility or lack thereof for ordering the heavens, are not founded on sound rational proofs, and so no intellectual commitment can be made to them insofar as description and explanation of celestial realities are concerned."<ref name=Setia/>

====Beginning of hay'a program====
[[File:Ibn al-Haytham.png|thumb|[[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen) was a pioneer of the Muslim ''haya'' tradition of astronomy, presented the first critique and reform of [[Ptolemy]]'s model, and introduced [[experiment]]ation to [[astrophysics]].]]

Between 1025 and 1028, [[Ibn al-Haytham]] ([[Latin]]ized as Alhazen), began what has been called the ''hay'a'' tradition of Islamic astronomy with his ''Al-Shuku ala Batlamyus'' (''Doubts on Ptolemy''). The ''hay'a'' tradition was concerned with accommodating mathematical hypotheses within "a configuration (''hay'a'') of physical orbs and spheres each of which turning {{sic|hide=yes}} uniformly about its own axis," thereby producing "a ''physically'' plausible ... description of what actually took place in the heavens."<ref>{{Harv|Sabra|1998|pp=294<U+2013>5}}</ref> While maintaining the physical reality of the [[geocentric model]], he was the first to criticize [[Ptolemy]]'s astronomical system, which he criticized on [[empirical]], [[observation]]al and [[experiment]]al grounds,<ref>{{Harv|Sabra|1998|p=300}}</ref> and for relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:
{{quote|"Ptolemy assumed an arrangement that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist."<ref>{{citation|url=http://setis.library.usyd.edu.au/stanford/entries/copernicus/index.html
|contribution=Nicolaus Copernicus|title=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|year=2004|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>}}

Ibn al-Haytham developed a physical structure of the Ptolemaic system in his ''Treatise on the configuration of the World'', or ''Maq<U+00E2>lah f<U+00EE> ''hay'at'' al-<U+201B><U+00E2>lam'', which became an influential work in the ''hay'a'' tradition.<ref>{{Harv|Langermann|1990|pp=25<U+2013>34}}</ref> In his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', he insisted that the heavenly bodies "were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]."<ref>{{Harv|Duhem|1969|p=28}}</ref>

In 1038, Ibn al-Haytham described the first non-Ptolemaic configuration in ''The Model of the Motions''. His reform was not concerned with [[cosmology]], as he developed a systematic study of celestial [[kinematics]] that was completely [[geometry|geometric]]. This in turn led to innovative developments in [[infinitesimal]] [[geometry]].<ref>{{Harv|Rashed|2007}}</ref> His reformed model was the first to reject the [[equant]]<ref>{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=20 & 53}}</ref> and [[Deferent|eccentrics]],<ref>{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=33<U+2013>4}}</ref> separate [[natural philosophy]] from astronomy, free celestial kinematics from cosmology, and reduce physical entities to geometrical entities. The model also propounded the [[Earth's rotation]] about its axis,<ref>{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=20 & 32<U+2013>33}}</ref> and the centres of motion were geometrical points without any physical significance, like [[Johannes Kepler]]'s model centuries later.<ref>{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=51<U+2013>2}}</ref> Ibn al-Haytham also describes an early version of [[Occam's razor]], where he employs only minimal hypotheses regarding the properties that characterize astronomical motions, as he attempts to eliminate from his planetary model the [[cosmology|cosmological]] hypotheses that cannot be observed from [[Earth]].<ref>{{Harv|Rashed|2007|pp=35<U+2013>6}}</ref>

[[File:Al-Biruni Afghan stamp.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ab<U+016B> al-Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>|Al-Biruni]] was the first to conduct elaborate [[experiment]]s related to astronomical phenomena, and he introduced the analysis of the [[acceleration]] of planets, discovered that the motions of the [[Apsis|solar apogee]] and [[precession]] are not identical, discussed the possibility of [[heliocentrism]], and suggested that the [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis would be consistent with his astronomical parameters.]]

====Early alternative models====
In 1030, [[Ab<U+016B> al-Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] discussed the [[Indian astronomy|Indian planetary theories]] of [[Aryabhata]], [[Brahmagupta]] and [[Varahamihira]] in his ''Ta'rikh al-Hind'' (Latinized as ''Indica''). Biruni stated that [[Brahmagupta]] and others consider that the [[Earth's rotation|earth rotates]] on its axis and Biruni noted that this does not create any mathematical problems.<ref>{{Harv|Nasr|1993|p=135, n. 13}}</ref>

Abu Said [[al-Sijzi]], a contemporary of al-Biruni, suggested the possible heliocentric movement of the Earth around the Sun, which al-Biruni did not reject.<ref name=Baker>{{Harv|Baker|Chapter|2002}}</ref> Al-Biruni agreed with the [[Earth's rotation]] about its own axis, and while he was initially neutral regarding the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] and [[geocentric model]]s,<ref>{{Harv|Marmura|1965}}</ref> he considered heliocentrism to be a philosophical problem.<ref name=Saliba/> He remarked that if the Earth rotates on its axis and moves around the Sun, it would remain consistent with his astronomical parameters:<ref name="G. Wiet, V. Elisseeff 1975 p. 649"/>
{{quote|"Rotation of the earth would in no way invalidate astronomical calculations, for all the astronomical data are as explicable in terms of the one theory as of the other. The problem is thus difficult of solution."}}

In 1031, al-Biruni completed his extensive astronomical encyclopaedia ''Kitab al-Qanun al-Mas'udi'' ([[Latin]]ized as ''Canon Mas<U+2019>udicus''),<ref name=Covington>{{Harv|Covington|2007}}</ref> in which he recorded his astronomical findings and formulated astronomical tables. In it he presented a geocentric model, tabulating the distance of all the [[celestial spheres]] from the central Earth, computed according to the principles of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]''.<ref>{{Harv|Nasr|1993|p=134}}</ref> The book introduces the mathematical technique of analysing the [[acceleration]] of the planets, and first states that the motions of the [[Apsis|solar apogee]] and the [[precession]] are not identical. Al-Biruni also discovered that the distance between the Earth and the Sun is larger than [[Ptolemy]]'s estimate, on the basis that Ptolemy disregarded annular eclipses.

In 1070, [[Juzjani, Abu Ubaid|Abu Ubayd al-Juzjani]], a pupil of [[Avicenna]], proposed a non-Ptolemaic configuration in his ''Tarik al-Aflak''. In his work, he indicated the so-called "[[equant]]" problem of the Ptolemic model, and proposed a solution for the problem. He claimed that his teacher Avicenna had also worked out the equant problem.<ref>{{Harv|Sabra|1998|pp=305<U+2013>306}}</ref>

====Andalusian Revolt====

In the 11th<U+2013>12th centuries, astronomers in [[al-Andalus]] such as [[Al-Majriti]] and [[Ibn al-Saffar]] introduced various works and used various instruments. Later [[Abu al-Salt]] is credited to have introduced the early astronomical works of [[Al-Andalus]] to [[North Africa]] where they have been preserved. Their students took up the challenge earlier posed by Ibn al-Haytham, namely to develop an alternate non-Ptolemaic configuration that evaded the errors found in the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic model]].<ref>{{Harv|Saliba|1981|p=219}}</ref> Like Ibn al-Haytham's critique, the anonymous Andalusian work, ''al-Istidrak ala Batlamyus'' (''Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy''), included a list of objections to Ptolemic astronomy. This marked the beginning of the Andalusian school's [[revolt]] against Ptolemaic astronomy, sometimes called the "Andalusian Revolt".  Among the major figures of Andalusian astronomy was [[Jabir ibn Aflah]], who invented the [[Torquetum]].<ref>{{citation|first=A. I.|last=Sabra|author-link=A. I.

In the 12th century, under the influence of [[Ibn Tufail]], the philosopher, [[Averroes]] and the astronomer, [[al-Bitruji]], rejected the [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles and eccentrics]] introduced by [[Ptolemy]]. They considered the [[Ptolemaic model]] to be inconsistent with [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] physical principles and argued for a strictly concentric model of the universe. Al-Bitruji failed in his attempt to make an accurate model of the motions of the planets employing [[homocentric spheres]].<ref>Bernard R. Goldstein, ed., ''Al-Bi<U+0163>r<U+016B>j<U+012B>: On the Principles of Astronomy'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1971), pp. 6<U+2013>14.</ref> Averroes wrote the following criticism of the Ptolemaic model of planetary motion:<ref name=Gingerich/>

{{quote|"To assert the existence of an eccentric sphere or an epicyclic sphere is contrary to nature. [...] The astronomy of our time offers no truth, but only agrees with the calculations and not with what existsUm."}}

Averroes' contemporary, [[Maimonides]], wrote the following on the planetary model proposed by [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace):

{{quote|"I have heard that Abu Bakr [Ibn Bajja] discovered a system in which no [[Deferent and epicycle|epicycles]] occur, but [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentric]] spheres are not excluded by him. I have not heard it from his pupils; and even if it be correct that he discovered such a system, he has not gained much by it, for eccentricity is likewise contrary to the principles laid down by Aristotle....

Ibn Bajjah also proposed the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]] to be made up of many stars but that it appears to be a continuous image due to the effect of [[refraction]] in the [[Earth's atmosphere]], citing his observation of the [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of Jupiter and Mars in 500 [[Islamic calendar|AH]] (1106/1107 AD) as evidence.<ref name=Montada/>

====Maragha School====
{{See|Maragheh observatory}}
{{See also|Zij-i Ilkhani}}

The "Maragha school" was an astronomical tradition beginning in the [[Maragheh observatory]] and continuing with astronomers from the [[Umayyad Mosque|Damascus mosque]] and [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|Samarkand observatory]]. Like their Andalusian predecessors, the Maragha astronomers attempted to solve the [[equant]] problem and produce alternative configurations to the [[Ptolemaic model]]. They were more successful than their Andalusian predecessors in producing non-Ptolemaic configurations which eliminated the equant and eccentrics, were more accurate than the Ptolemaic model in numerically predicting planetary positions, and were in better agreement with [[empirical]] [[observation]]s.<ref name=Saliba-1994>{{Harv|Saliba|1994b|pp=233<U+2013>234 & 240}}</ref> The most important of the Maragha astronomers included [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] (d. 1266), [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] (1201<U+2013>1274), [[Najm al-D<U+012B>n al-Qazw<U+012B>n<U+012B> al-K<U+0101>tib<U+012B>]] (d. 1277), [[Qotb al-Din Shirazi]] (1236<U+2013>1311), Sadr al-Sharia al-Bukhari (c. 1347), [[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304<U+2013>1375), [[Ali Qushji]] (c. 1474), [[al-Birjandi]] (d. 1525) and Shams al-Din al-Khafri (d. 1550).<ref>{{Harv|Dallal|1999|p=171}}</ref>

[[File:Al-Tusi Nasir.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] resolved significant problems in the [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic system]] with the [[Tusi-couple]], which later played an important role in the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]].]]

Some have described their achievements in the 13th and 14th centuries as a "Maragha Revolution", "Maragha School Revolution", or "[[Scientific Revolution]] before the [[Renaissance]]". An important aspect of this revolution included the realization that astronomy should aim to describe the behavior of [[Physical body|physical bodies]] in [[Islamic mathematics|mathematical]] language, and should not remain a mathematical [[hypothesis]], which would only save the [[phenomena]]. The Maragha astronomers also realized that the [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian]] view of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in the universe being only circular or [[linear]] was not true, as the [[Tusi-couple]] showed that linear motion could also be produced by applying [[circular motion]]s only.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Unlike the ancient Greek and Hellenistic astronomers who were not concerned with the coherence between the mathematical and physical principles of a planetary theory, Islamic astronomers insisted on the need to match the mathematics with the real world surrounding them,<ref>{{citation|first=George|last=Saliba|author-link=George Saliba|date=Autumn 1999|title=Seeking the Origins of Modern Science?|journal=BRIIFS|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.riifs.org/review_articles/review_v1no2_sliba.htm |accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> which gradually evolved from a reality based on [[Aristotelian physics]] to one based on an empirical and mathematical [[physics]] after the work of Ibn al-Shatir. The Maragha Revolution was thus characterized by a shift away from the philosophical foundations of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian cosmology]] and [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] and towards a greater emphasis on the empirical observation and [[Islamic mathematics|mathematization]] of astronomy and of [[nature]] in general, as exemplified in the works of Ibn al-Shatir, Qushji, al-Birjandi and al-Khafri.<ref>{{Harv|Saliba|1994b|pp=42 & 80}}</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Ahmad|last=Dallal|year=2001<U+2013>2002|title=The Interplay of Science and Theology in the Fourteenth-century Kalam|publisher=From Medieval to Modern in the Islamic World, Sawyer Seminar at the [[University of Chicago]] |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/institute/sawyer/archive/islam/dallal.html |accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{Harv|Huff|2003|pp=217<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Other achievements of the Maragha school include the first empirical observational evidence for the [[Earth's rotation]] on its axis by Tusi and Qushji,<ref name=Ragep/> the separation of [[natural philosophy]] from astronomy by Ibn al-Shatir and Qushji,<ref name=Ragep2>{{Harv|Ragep|2001b}}</ref> the rejection of the Ptolemaic model on empirical rather than [[philosophical]] grounds by Ibn al-Shatir,<ref name=Saliba-1994/> and the development of a non-Ptolemaic model by Ibn al-Shatir that was mathematically identical to the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric Copernical model]].<ref>{{Harv|Saliba|1994b|pp=254 & 256<U+2013>257}}</ref>

[[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] (d. 1266) was the first of the Maragheh astronomers to develop a non-Ptolemaic model, and he proposed a new theorem, the "Urdi lemma".<ref>{{Harv|Saliba|1979}}</ref> [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] (1201<U+2013>1274) resolved significant problems in the Ptolemaic system by developing the [[Tusi-couple]] as an alternative to the physically problematic [[equant]] introduced by Ptolemy.<ref name=Gill>{{Harv|Gill|2005}}</ref> Tusi's student [[Qotb al-Din Shirazi]] (1236<U+2013>1311), in his ''The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens'', discussed the possibility of [[heliocentrism]]. Al-Qazw<U+012B>n<U+012B> al-K<U+0101>tib<U+012B> (d. 1277), who also worked at the Maragheh observatory, in his ''Hikmat al-'Ain'', wrote an argument for a heliocentric model, though he later abandoned the idea.<ref name=Baker/> 

[[File:Ghotb2.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval manuscript by [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]] depicting an epicyclic planetary model.]]

[[Ibn al-Shatir]] (1304<U+2013>1375) of [[Damascus]], in ''A Final Inquiry Concerning the Rectification of Planetary Theory'', incorporated the Urdi lemma, and eliminated the need for an equant by introducing an extra epicycle (the Tusi-couple), departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way that was mathematically identical to what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] did in the 16th century. Unlike previous astronomers before him, Ibn al-Shatir was not concerned with adhering to the theoretical principles of [[natural philosophy]] or Aristotelian [[cosmology]], but rather to produce a model that was more consistent with [[empirical]] observations. For example, it was Ibn al-Shatir's concern for observational accuracy which led him to eliminate the epicycle in the Ptolemaic [[Sun|solar]] model and all the eccentrics, epicycles and equant in the Ptolemaic [[Lunar theory|lunar model]]. His model was thus in better agreement with empirical [[observation]]s than any previous model,<ref name=Saliba-1994/> and was also the first that permitted empirical [[Experiment|testing]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Faruqi | first1 = Y.

An area of active discussion in the Maragheh school, and later the [[Samarkand]] and [[Istanbul]] observatories, was the possibility of the [[Earth's rotation]]. Supporters of this theory included [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]], Nizam al-Din al-Nisaburi (c. 1311), al-Sayyid al-Sharif al-Jurjani (1339<U+2013>1413), Ali Qushji (d. 1474), and Abd al-Ali [[al-Birjandi]] (d. 1525). Al-Tusi was the first to present empirical observational evidence of the Earth's rotation, using the location of [[comet]]s relevant to the Earth as evidence, which Qushji elaborated on with further empirical observations while rejecting Aristotelian [[natural philosophy]] altogether. Both of their arguments were similar to the arguments later used by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in 1543 to explain the Earth's rotation (see [[#Astronomical physics and Earth's motion|Astronomical physics and Earth's motion]] section below).<ref name=Ragep>{{Harv|Ragep|2001a}}</ref>

However, it remains a fact that the Maragha school never made the big leap to heliocentrism.<ref name="Huff">Toby E.Huff(1993): [http://books.google.com/books?id=DLxRGjr1gYQC&pg=PA58 ''The rise of early modern science: Islam, China, and the West'']</ref> In addition, the influence of the Maragha school on [[Copernicus]] remains speculative, since there is no documentary evidence to prove it. The possibility that Copernicus independently developed the Tusi couple remains open, since no researcher has yet proven that he knew about Tusi<U+00B4>s work or the Maragha school.<ref name="Huff" /><ref>N.K. Singh,M. Zaki Kirmani, [http://books.google.com/books?id=lKa9khFcKmQC&pg=PA808 ''Encyclopaedia of Islamic science and scientists'']</ref>
It has been argued that, given some differences between the two models, it is more likely that Copernicus could have taken the ideas found in the Tusi couple from [[Proclus|Proclus's]] ''Commentary on the First Book of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Veselovsky | first1 = I.

====Multiversal cosmology====
{{Main|Islamic cosmology}}

[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] (1149<U+2013>1209), in dealing with his [[Physics in medieval Islam|conception of physics]] and the physical world in his ''Matalib'', discusses [[Islamic cosmology]] and astronomy. He criticizes the idea of the [[geocentric model|Earth's centrality]] within the universe and "explores the notion of the existence of a [[multiverse]] in the context of his commentary" on the [[Qur'an]]ic verse, "All praise belongs to God, Lord of the Worlds." He raises the question of whether the term "[[world]]s" in this verse refers to "multiple worlds within this single [[universe]] or [[cosmos]], or to many other universes or a multiverse beyond this known universe." In volume 4 of the ''Matalib'', Al-Razi states:<ref name="Setia"/>

{{quote|It is established by evidence that there exists beyond the world a void without a terminal limit (''khala' la nihayata laha''), and it is established as well by evidence that God Most High has power over all contingent beings (''al-mumkinat''). Therefore He the Most High has the power (''qadir'') to create a thousand thousand worlds (''alfa alfi 'awalim'') beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has of the throne (''al-arsh''), the chair (''al-kursiyy''), the heavens (''al-samawat'') and the earth (''al-ard''), and the sun (''al-shams'') and the moon (''al-qamar''). The arguments of the philosophers (''dala'il al-falasifah'') for establishing that the world is one are weak, flimsy arguments founded upon feeble premises.}}

Al-Razi rejected the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] and [[Avicennism|Avicennian]] view of the impossibility of multiple worlds or universes. He describes the main Aristotelian arguments against the existence of multiple worlds or universes, pointing out their weaknesses and refuting them. This rejection arose from his affirmation of [[atomism]], as advocated by the [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Islamic theology]], which entails the existence of vacant space in which the atoms move, combine and separate. He discussed more on the issue of the [[Vacuum|void]] in greater detail in volume 5 of the ''Matalib''.<ref name=Setia/> He argued that God has the power to fill the [[vacuum]] with an infinite number of universes.<ref>{{citation|title=al-Razi, Fakhr al-Din (1149<U+2013>1209)|work=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|author=John Cooper|year=1998|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ip/rep/H044.htm|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref>

====Observational astronomy====

[[File:Sughrat.jpg|left|thumb|An Arabic manuscript from the 13th century depicting Astronomers]]

The [[transit of Venus]] and [[transit of Mercury]] were claimed to have been observed by medieval Islamic astronomers. In the 11th century, the Persian polymath [[Avicenna]] claimed to have observed the transit of Venus across the Sun. He took this as evidence that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun (in the Ptolemaic cosmology).<ref>{{citation|title=Ibn S<U+012B>n<U+0101>: Ab<U+016B> <U+02BF>Al<U+012B> al<U+2010><U+1E24>usayn ibn <U+02BF>Abdall<U+0101>h ibn S<U+012B>n<U+0101>|author=Sally P.

The astronomical tradition established by the Maragha school continued at the [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]] at [[Samarkand]], in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]. Founded by [[Ulugh Beg]] in the early 15th century, the observatory made considerable progress in observational astronomy. In the ''[[Zij-i Sultani]]'', Beg determined the length of the [[sidereal year]] as 365<sup>d</sup> 5<sup>h</sup> 49<sup>m</sup> 15<sup>s</sup>, which has an error of +25<sup>s</sup>, making it more accurate than [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]' estimate which had an error of +30<sup>s</sup>. Beg also determined the Earth's [[axial tilt]] as 23.52 degrees, which remains the most accurate measurement to date. It was more accurate than later measurements by Copernicus and [[Tycho Brahe]], and matches the currently accepted value precisely.<ref name=Thurston>Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 194, ISBN 0-387-94107-X.</ref>

====Islamic astronomy in the Far East====
{{See also|Chinese astronomy|Islam in China|Islam in Korea}}

Muslim astronomers were brought to [[China]] in order to work on calendar making and astronomy since the [[Abbasid]] period the first major introduction of Islamic [[Mathematics]] and [[Astronomy]] occurred during the [[Song dynasty]]. 

[[Ma Yize]] (ca. 910 <U+2013> 1005) was an important Chinese Muslim ([[Hui people|Hui]]), Islamic astronomer and astrologist who worked as the chief official of the astronomical observatory for the [[Song dynasty]]. In the early 10th Century, the Chinese emperor of the Song dynasty encouraged the advancement of the study of astronomy and its related disciplines. In 961, the Emperor [[Taizu]] (r. 960<U+2013>976) appointed [[Ma Yize]] (910?<U+2013>1005) as the chief official to take charge of the government observatory. After compiling several important astrological works, including the [[Yingtianli]] (Calendar of Corresponding Heavens). His job was to provide observation, and computation of the regularities in celestial phenomena, using the Islamic methods. His findings were used by Wang Chuna in the compilation of Yingtianli, which was completed in 963. The calculation, based on a 7-day week system similar to that in the Islamic calendar, was first adopted in this document, which was the most important occurrence in the Chinese history of calendrical methods.

Ma Yize might have consulted many works of Islamic mathematical astronomy into Chinese, including:

*Kitab al-Zij, 880, by Abu'Abdallah [[al-Battani]] (858<U+2013>929)
*[[al-Zij al-sabi]], [[The Sabian Tables]]
*Kitab Matali' al-Buruj, On the Ascensions of the Signs of the Zodiac
*Kitab Aqdar al- Ittisalat, On the Quantities of the Astrological Applications

It is possible that Ma was influenced by [[Al-Battani]] and [[Al-Hamdani]]. Owing to Ma's contribution to the compilation of 'Yingtianli', Ma was made a hereditary noble and his sons later succeeded his position with the Imperial Observatory.

This period was considered the period of stagnation, when the traditional system of astronomy continued to be practised with enthusiasm, but with decreasing innovation.<ref name=Dallal162/> It was believed there was no innovation of major significance during this period, but this view has been rejected by historians of astronomy in recent times, who argue that Muslim astronomers continued to make significant advances in astronomy through to the 16th century and possibly after this as well.<ref name=Ragep2/><ref name=Saliba-2000>{{Harv|Saliba|2000}}</ref> After the 16th century, there appears to have been little concern for [[Astrophysics|theoretical astronomy]], but [[observational astronomy]] in the Islamic tradition continued in the three Muslim [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder empires]]: the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Persia, and the [[Mughal Empire]] of India.

====Astronomical physics and Earth's motion====
{{See also|Islamic cosmology}}
[[File:Ali Ku<U+015F><U+00E7>u Portre.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ali Qushji]] provided [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] for the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's motion]] and developed an [[Astrophysics|astronomical physics]] independent from [[Aristotelian physics]] and [[natural philosophy]].]]

The work of [[Ali Qushji]] (d. 1474), who worked at [[Samarkand]] and then [[Istanbul]], is seen as a late example of innovation in Islamic theoretical astronomy and it is believed he may have possibly had some influence on [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] due to similar arguments concerning the [[Earth's rotation]]. Before Qushji, the only astronomer to present [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation was [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] (d. 1274), who used the phenomena of [[comet]]s to refute [[Ptolemy]]'s claim that a stationery Earth can be determined through observation. Al-Tusi, however, eventually accepted that the Earth was stationery on the basis of [[On the Heavens|Aristotelian cosmology]] and [[natural philosophy]]. By the 15th century, the influence of [[Aristotelian physics]] and natural philosophy was declining due to religious opposition from [[Islamic theology|Islamic theologians]] such as [[Al-Ghazali]] who opposed to the interference of [[Aristotelianism]] in astronomy, opening up possibilities for an astronomy unrestrained by philosophy. Under this influence, Qushji, in his ''Concerning the Supposed Dependence of Astronomy upon Philosophy'', rejected Aristotelian physics and completely separated natural philosophy from astronomy, allowing astronomy to become a purely [[empirical]] and mathematical science. This allowed him to explore alternatives to the Aristotelian notion of a stationery Earth, as he explored the idea of a moving Earth. He also observed comets and elaborated on al-Tusi's argument. He took it a step further and concluded, on the basis of empirical evidence rather than speculative philosophy, that the moving Earth theory is just as likely to be true as the stationary Earth theory and that it is not possible to empirically deduce which theory is true.<ref name=Ragep/><ref name=Ragep2/><ref>Edith Dudley Sylla, "Creation and nature", in Arthur Stephen McGrade (2003), pp. 178<U+2013>179, [[Cambridge University Press]], ISBN 0521000637.</ref>

His predecessor al-Tusi had previously realized that "the monoformity of falling bodies, and the uniformity of celestial motions," both moved <U+201C>in a single way,<U+201D> though he still relied on Aristotelian philosophy to provide "certain principles that only the natural philosophers could provide the astronomer." Qushji took this concept further and proposed that "the astronomer had no need for Aristotelian physics and in fact should establish his own physical principles independently of the natural philosophers." Alongside his rejection of Aristotle's concept of a stationary Earth,<ref>{{citation|first=F.

However, it is likely that they both may have arrived at similar conclusions due to using the earlier work of al-Tusi as a basis.

This can be considered as evidence that not only was Copernicus influenced by the mathematical models of Islamic astronomers, but may have also been influenced by the astronomical physics they began developing and their views on the Earth's motion.<ref>{{citation|first=F. Jamil|last=Ragep|title=Copernicus and his Islamic Predecessors: Some Historical Remarks|journal=Filozofski vestnik|volume=XXV|issue=2|year=2004|pages=125<U+2013>142 [137<U+2013>9]}}</ref>

In the 16th century, the debate on the Earth's motion was continued by [[Al-Birjandi]] (d. 1528), who in his analysis of what might occur if the Earth were moving, develops a hypothesis similar to [[Galileo Galilei]]'s notion of "circular [[inertia]]",<ref>{{Harv|Ragep|2001b|pp=63<U+2013>4}}</ref> which he described in the following observational test (as a response to one of [[Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi]]'s arguments):

{{quote|"The small or large rock will fall to the Earth along the path of a line that is perpendicular to the plane (''sath'') of the horizon; this is witnessed by experience (''tajriba''). And this perpendicular is away from the tangent point of the Earth<U+2019>s sphere and the plane of the perceived (''hissi'') horizon. This point moves with the motion of the Earth and thus there will be no difference in place of fall of the two rocks."<ref>{{Harv|Ragep|2001a|pp=152<U+2013>3}}</ref>}}

====Planetary theory====
[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb||300px|right|A manuscript written during the Abbasid Era.]]
It was traditionally believed that Islamic astronomers made no more advances in planetary theory after the work of [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the 14th century, but recent studies have shown that there were several significant advances in planetary theory through to the 16th century. [[Ali Qushji]], for example, improved on al-Tusi's planetary model and presented an alternative planetary model for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].<ref>{{citation|last=Saliba|first=George|author-link=George Saliba|title=Arabic planetary theories after the eleventh century AD|pages=123<U+2013>4}}, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=58<U+2013>127}}</ref> He also rejected the Aristotelian notion of the planets moving in [[uniform circular motion]].<ref name=Savage-Smith-541/> [[George Saliba]] also studied the works of a 16th century astronomer, Shams al-Din al-Khafri (d. 1550), a [[Safavid]] commentator on earlier [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha astronomers]]. Saliba wrote the following on al-Khafri's work:

{{quote|By his sheer insight into the role of mathematics in describing natural phenomena, this astronomer managed to bring the hay'a tradition to such unparalleled heights that could not be matched anywhere else in the world at that time neither mathematically nor astronomically. By working on the alternative mathematical models that could replace those of Ptolemy, and by scrutinizing the works of his predecessors who were all searching for unique mathematical models that could describe the physical phenomena consistently, this astronomer finally realized that all mathematical modeling had no physical truth by itself and was simply another language with which one could describe the physical observed reality. He also realized that the specific phenomena that were being described by the Ptolemaic models did not have unique mathematical solutions that were subject to the same restraints. Rather there were several mathematical models that could account for the Ptolemaic observations, yield identical predictive results at the same critical points used by Ptolemy to construct his own models (thus accounting for the observations as perfectly as Ptolemy could) and still meet the consistency requirement that was imposed by the Aristotelian cosmology which was adopted by the writers in the ''hay'a'' tradition.<ref name=Saliba-2000/>}}

[[File:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|right|A model of the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric system]] attributed to [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].]]

====Ottoman observational astronomy====
{{See also|Science and technology in the Ottoman Empire}}

Another notable 16th century Muslim astronomer was the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] astronomer [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]], who built the [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] in 1577, where he carried out astronomical observations until 1580. He produced a [[Zij]] (named ''Unbored Pearl'') and [[astronomical catalog]]ues that were more accurate than those of his contemporaries, [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Taqi al-Din was also the first astronomer to employ a [[Decimal separator|decimal point]] notation in his [[observation]]s rather than the [[sexagesimal]] fractions used by his contemporaries and predecessors.<ref name=Tekeli>Sevim Tekeli, "Taqi al-Din", in Helaine Selin (1997), ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]], ISBN 0792340663.</ref> He also invented a variety of astronomical instruments, including accurate mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s from 1556 to 1580.

After the destruction of the Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din in 1580, astronomical activity stagnated in the Ottoman Empire, until the introduction of [[Copernican heliocentrism]] in 1660, when the Ottoman scholar Ibrahim Efendi al-Zigetvari Tezkireci translated No<U+00EB>l Duret's French astronomical work (written in 1637) into Arabic.<ref>{{citation|last=Zaken|first=Avner Ben|year=2004|title=The heavens of the sky and the heavens of the heart: the Ottoman cultural context for the introduction of post-Copernican astronomy|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|volume=37|pages=1<U+2013>28}}</ref>

====Islamic astronomy in India====
{{See also|Indian astronomy|Islam in India}}

In the [[Mughal Empire]], the 16th and 17th centuries saw a synthesis between Islamic and [[Indian astronomy]], where Islamic observational techniques and instruments were combined with [[Indian mathematics|Hindu computational]] techniques. While there appears to have been little concern for theoretical astronomy, Muslim and [[Hindu]] astronomers in [[History of India|India]] continued to make advances in [[observational astronomy]] and produced nearly a hundred ''[[Zij]]'' treatises. [[Humayun]] built a personal observatory near [[Delhi]], while [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]] were also intending to build observatories but were unable to do so. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, however, it was a Hindu king, [[Jai Singh II of Amber]], who attempted to revive the Islamic tradition of astronomy in India. In the early 18th century, he built several large observatories called [[Yantra Mandir]]s in order to rival the famous Samarkand observatory, and in order to update [[Ulugh Beg]]'s ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'' with more accurate observations. The instruments and observational techniques used at the observatory were mainly derived from the Islamic tradition, and the computational techniques from the Hindu tradition.<ref name=Sharma>{{citation|title=Sawai Jai Singh and His Astronomy|first=Virendra Nath|last=Sharma|year=1995|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publ.|isbn=8120812565|pages=8<U+2013>9}}</ref><ref name=Baber>{{citation |title=The Science of Empire: Scientific Knowledge, Civilization, and Colonial Rule in India |first=Zaheer |last=Baber |year=1996 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0791429199 |pages=82<U+2013>9}}</ref> In particular, one of the most remarkable astronomical instruments invented by Muslims in Mughal India is the seamless celestial globe (see [[#Globes|Globes]] below).

Jai Singh also invited European [[Jesuit]] astronomers to his observatory, who had bought back the astronomical tables compiled by [[Philippe de La Hire]] in 1702. After examining La Hire's work, Jai Singh concluded that the techniques and instruments used in the European tradition were inferior to the Islamic and Indian traditions. It is uncertain whether Islamic astronomers in India were aware of the [[Copernican Revolution]] via the Jesuits, but it appears they were not concerned with theoretical astronomy, hence the theoretical advances in Europe did not interest them at the time.<ref>{{citation |title=The Science of Empire: Scientific Knowledge, Civilization, and Colonial Rule in India |first=Zaheer |last=Baber |year=1996 |publisher=[[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0791429199 |pages=89<U+2013>90}}</ref> They did, however, employ the use of [[telescope]]s. In the ''Zij-i Muhammad Shahi'', Jai Singh states: "telescopes were constructed in my kingdom and using them a number of observations were carried out."<ref name=Ansari>{{citation|title=History of oriental astronomy: proceedings of the joint discussion-17 at the 23rd General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, organised by the Commission 41 (History of Astronomy), held in Kyoto, August 25<U+2013>26, 1997|author=S.

Following the arrival of the British [[East India Company]] in the 18th century, Islamic astronomy was slowly displaced by European astronomy, though there were attempts at harmonizing the two traditions. For example, the Indian Islamic scholar Mir Muhammad Hussain had travelled to England in 1774 to study Western science and, on his return to India in 1777, he wrote a Persian treatise on astronomy. He wrote about the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model, and argued that there exists an infinite number of [[universe]]s (''awalim''), each with their own planets and stars, and that this demonstrates the [[omnipotence]] of God, who is not confined to a single universe. Hussain's idea of a universe resembles the modern concept of a [[galaxy]], thus his view corresponds to the modern view that the universe consists of billions of galaxies, each one consisting of billions of stars.<ref>{{citation|title=History of oriental astronomy: proceedings of the joint discussion-17 at the 23rd General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, organised by the Commission 41 (History of Astronomy), held in Kyoto, August 25<U+2013>26, 1997|author=S.

The treatise incorporated the heliocentric system into the ''Zij'' tradition.<ref>{{citation|title=History of oriental astronomy: proceedings of the joint discussion-17 at the 23rd General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, organised by the Commission 41 (History of Astronomy), held in Kyoto, August 25<U+2013>26, 1997|author=S.

==Observatories==
Islamic astronomers had based their work largely on actual observations of the heavens, far more so than earlier Greek astronomers who relied heavily upon abstract calculation.<ref>{{citation|title=The Astronomical Manuscripts of Na<U+1E63><U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n <U+1E6C><U+016B>s<U+012B>|author=Ute Ballay|journal=[[Arabica (journal)|Arabica]]|volume=37|issue=3|date=November 1990|pages=389<U+2013>392 [389]|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4057148|accessdate=2010-03-29|doi=10.1163/157005890X00050}}</ref> This led to the emergence of the modern astronomical [[observatory]] as a [[research institute]]<ref name=Kennedy-1962/> (as opposed to a private [[observation post]] as was the case in ancient times)<ref name = "Micheau-992-3">{{citation|last=Micheau|first=Francoise|contribution=The Scientific Institutions in the Medieval Near East|pages=992<U+2013>3}}, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=985<U+2013>1007}}</ref> being first introduced by medieval Muslim astronomers, who produced accurate [[Zij]] treatises using these observatories.

Islamic observatories were also the first to employ enormously large astronomical instruments in order to greatly improve the accuracy of their observations.<ref name=Kennedy-1962>{{Harv|Kennedy|1962}}</ref>

The medieval Islamic observatories were also the earliest institutions to emphasize group research (as opposed to individual research) and where "theoretical investigations went hand in hand with observations." In this sense, they were similar to modern scientific research institutions.<ref>{{citation|last=Prof. Bakar|first=Osman ([[Georgetown University]])|publisher=CIC's annual Ottawa dinner|url=http://www.al-huda.com/Article_5%205.htm|title=Islam's Contribution to Human Civilization: Science and Culture|date=October 15, 2001|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

===Early observatories===
The first systematic observations in Islam are reported to have taken place under the patronage of [[al-Ma'mun]], and the first Islamic observatories were built in the 9th century [[Iraq]] under his patronage. In many private observatories from [[Damascus]] to [[Baghdad]], [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] degrees were measured, solar parameters were established, and detailed observations of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planets]] were undertaken. One of these early observatories in Baghdad was the Al-Shammisiyyah observatory, where between 825 to 835, [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]] conducted various observations and estimated a number of geographic and astronomical values.<ref name=Langermann/>

In the 10th century, the [[Buwayhid]] dynasty encouraged the undertaking of extensive works in Astronomy, such as the construction of a large scale instrument with which observations were made in the year 950. We know of this by recordings made in the ''zij'' of astronomers such as Ibn al-Alam. The great astronomer [[Abd Al-Rahman Al Sufi]] was patronised by prince [['Adud al-Dawla]], who systematically revised [[Ptolemy]]'s catalogue of [[star]]s. [[Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi]] also constructed an observatory in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], Iran where he is known to have constructed the first huge [[sextant (astronomical)|mural sextant]] in 994 AD.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Al-Khujandi|title=Abu Mahmud Hamid ibn al-Khidr Al-Khujandi}}</ref> [[Sharaf al-Daula]] also established a similar observatory in [[Baghdad]]. Reports by [[Ibn Yunus]] and [[al-Zarqall]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] indicate the use of sophisticated instruments for their time.

[[File:Maragheh Observatory.jpg|thumb|right|Current status of [[Maragheh observatory]].]]

It was [[Malik Shah I]] who established the first large observatory, probably in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]. It was here where [[Omar Khayy<U+00E1>m]] with many other collaborators constructed a [[zij]] and formulated the [[Iranian calendar|Persian solar calendar]], a.k.a. the ''jalali calendar'', the most accurate [[solar calendar]] to date. A modern version of this calendar is still in official use in [[Iran]] today.

===Late medieval observatories===
{{See|Maragheh observatory|Ulugh Beg Observatory|Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din}}

The more influential observatories, however, were established beginning in the 13th century. The [[Maragheh observatory]] was founded by [[Nas<U+012B>r al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] under the patronage of [[Hulegu Khan]] in the 13th century. Here, al-Tusi supervised its technical construction at [[Maragheh]]. The facility contained resting quarters for [[Hulagu Khan]], as well as a library and mosque. Some of the top astronomers of the day gathered there, and their collaboration resulted in important alternatives to the [[Ptolemaic model]] over a period of 50 years. The observations of al-Tusi and his team of researchers were compiled in the ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]''.

[[File:Soviet Union stamp 1987 CPA 5876.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ulugh Beg]], founder of the large [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]] in [[Samarkand]], honored on this [[Soviet]] stamp.]]

In 1420, prince [[Ulugh Beg]], himself an astronomer and mathematician, founded another large observatory, the [[Ulugh Beg Observatory]], in [[Samarkand]]. The remains of the observatory were excavated in 1908 by Russian teams. Ulugh Beg, alongside his team of researchers that included [[Jamsh<U+012B>d al-K<U+0101>sh<U+012B>]] and [[Ali Qushji]], compiled the results of their observations in the ''[[Zij-i-Sultani]]'' (1437).

[[File:Istambul observatory in 1577.jpg|thumb|[[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] in 1577.]]

In 1577, [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf]] founded a large [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din|observatory in Istanbul]]. This was on the same scale as those in Maragha and Samarkand as well as that of his contemporary [[Tycho Brahe]].

In the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Humayun]] built a personal observatory near [[Delhi]] in the 16th century, while [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]] were also intending to build observatories but were unable to do so. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Hindu king [[Jai Singh II of Amber]] built several large observatories called [[Yantra Mandir]]s inspired by the famous Samarkand observatory. The instruments and observational techniques used at the observatory were mainly derived from the Islamic tradition, and the computational techniques from the Hindu tradition.<ref name=Sharma/><ref name=Baber/>

==Instruments==

Modern knowledge of the instruments used by Muslim astronomers primarily comes from two sources. First the remaining instruments in private and museum collections today, and second the treatises and manuscripts preserved from the Middle Ages.

Muslims both made many improvements to instruments already in use before their time, such as adding new scales or details and significantly enlarging them to improve accuracy,<ref name=Thurston/> and invented many of their own new instruments. Islamic astronomers were also the first to build enormously large scientific instruments in order to greatly improve the accuracy of observations.<ref name=Kennedy-1962/> Their contributions to astronomical instrumentation are abundant. Many of these instruments were often invented or designed for [[Islam]]ic purposes, such as the determination of the [[Qibla]] (direction to [[Mecca]]) or the [[Salat times|times of Salah]] prayers.

===Astrolabes and planisphere===
Brass [[astrolabe]]s were developed in much of the [[Islamic]] world, often as an aid to finding the [[qibla]]. The [http://www.soas.ac.uk/visitors/gallery/previous/islamicpatronage/popup25732.html earliest known example] is dated 315 [[Islamic calendar|AH]], (927/8 CE). The first person credited for building the Astrolabe in the Islamic world is reportedly [[Al-Fazari, Mohammad|Fazari]].<ref>[[Richard Nelson Frye]], ''Golden Age of Persia'', p. 163.</ref> Though the first astrolabe to chart the stars was invented in the [[Hellenistic civilization]], Fazari made several improvements to the device, such as the introduction of angular scales to the astrolabe,<ref>{{citation|title=Surveying and navigational instruments from the historical standpoint|author=L.

In the 10th century, [[Al-Sufi]] first described over 1,000 different uses of an astrolabe, in areas as diverse as astronomy, [[Islamic astrology|astrology, horoscopes]], [[Mariner's astrolabe|navigation]], [[surveying]], [[time]]keeping, [[Qibla]], [[Salah]], etc.

;''Large astrolabe''

[[Ibn Yunus]] in the 10th century accurately observed more than 10,000 entries for the sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe with a diameter of nearly 1.4 meters.<ref name=Zaimeche/>

;''Mechanical geared astrolabe''

The first [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] astrolabes with [[gear]]s were invented in the Muslim world, and were perfected by Ibn Samh (c. 1020). One such device with eight [[gear]]-wheels was also constructed by [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] in 996. These can be considered as an ancestor of the [[mechanical clock]]s developed by later Muslim engineers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/woi_knowledge.html|title=Islam, Knowledge, and Science|publisher=[[University of Southern California]]|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref>

;''Universal astrolabe (Saphaea)''

The first astrolabe instruments were used to read the rise of the time of rise of the [[Sun]] and fixed stars. The first universal astrolabes were later constructed in the Islamic world and which, unlike their predecessors, did not depend on the [[latitude]] of the observer and could be used anywhere on the Earth. The basic idea for a latitude-independent astrolabe was conceived in the 9th century by [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi]] in Baghdad and the topic was later discussed in the early 11th century by [[Al-Sijzi]] in Persia.<ref>{{citation|title=The history of cartography|volume=2|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=0226316351|page=29|author=John Brian Harley, David Woodward}}</ref>

The first known universal astrolabe to be constructed was by Ali ibn Khalaf al-Shakkaz, an [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic herbalist]] or [[apothecary]] in 11th century [[Al-Andalus]]. His instrument could solve problems of spherical astronomy for any geographic latitude, though in a somewhat more complicated fashion than the standard astrolabe. Another, more advanced and more famous, universal astrolabe was constructed by [[Ab<U+016B> Ish<U+0101>q Ibr<U+0101>h<U+012B>m al-Zarq<U+0101>l<U+012B>]] (Arzachel) soon after. His instrument became known in Europe as the "Saphaea".<ref>{{citation|title=The history of cartography|volume=2|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=0226316351|pages=28<U+2013>9|author=John Brian Harley, David Woodward}}</ref> It was a universal lamina (plate) which "constituted a universal device representing a stereographic projection for the terrestrial equator and could be used to solve all the problems of spherical astronomy for any latitude."<ref name=King-1983-533/>

;''Zuraqi''

The Zuraqi is a unique astrolabe invented by [[Al-Sijzi]] for a [[heliocentric]] planetary model in which the [[Earth's rotation|Earth is moving]] rather than the sky.<ref name=Nasr>{{Harv|Nasr|1993|pp=135<U+2013>136}}</ref>

;''Planisphere''

In the early 11th century, [[Ab<U+016B> Rayh<U+0101>n al-B<U+012B>r<U+016B>n<U+012B>]] invented and wrote the first treatise on the [[planisphere]], which was an early [[analog computer]].<ref>[[Will Durant]] (1950). ''[[The Story of Civilization]] IV: The Age of Faith'', p. 239-45.</ref> The astrolabe was a predecessor of the modern planisphere.

;''Linear astrolabe''

A famous work by [[Sharaf al-D<U+012B>n al-T<U+016B>s<U+012B>]] is one in which he describes the linear astrolabe, sometimes called the "staff of al-Tusi", which he invented.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-342088/linear-astrolabe|contribution=Linear astrolabe|title=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]|year=2007|accessdate=2008-01-22|publisher=[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica Inc.]]}}</ref>

===Analog computers===
Various [[analog computer]] devices were invented to compute the [[latitude]]s of the Sun, Moon, and planets, the [[ecliptic]] of the Sun, the time of day at which [[planetary conjunction]]s will occur, and for performing [[linear interpolation]].

;''Equatorium''

The [[Equatorium]] was an [[analog computer]] invented by [[Ab<U+016B> Ish<U+0101>q Ibr<U+0101>h<U+012B>m al-Zarq<U+0101>l<U+012B>]] (Arzachel) in [[al-Andalus]], probably around 1015 CE. It is a mechanical device for finding the [[longitude]]s and positions of the [[Moon]], [[Sun]], and [[planet]]s, without calculation using a geometrical model to represent the [[celestial body]]'s mean and anomalistic position.<ref>{{Harv|Hassan}}</ref>

;''Mechanical geared calendar computer''

In the 15th century, [[al-Kashi]] invented the Plate of Conjunctions, a computing instrument used to determine the time of day at which [[planetary conjunction]]s will occur,<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1947|p=56}}</ref> and for performing [[linear interpolation]].<ref name=Kennedy/>

;''Planetary computer''

In the 15th century, [[al-Kashi]] also invented a mechanical planetary computer which he called the Plate of Zones, which could graphically solve a number of planetary problems, including the prediction of the true positions in [[longitude]] of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]],<ref name=Kennedy>{{Harv|Kennedy|1950}}</ref> and the [[planet]]s in terms of [[elliptical orbit]]s;<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1952}}</ref> the [[latitude]]s of the Sun, Moon, and planets; and the [[ecliptic]] of the Sun. The instrument also incorporated an [[alhidade]] and [[ruler]].<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1951}}</ref>

===Astronomical clocks===
The Muslims constructed a variety of [[astronomical clock]]s for use in their observatories.<ref>{{Harv|Ajram|1992}}</ref>

;''Water-powered astronomical clocks''

[[Al-Jazari]] devised monumental [[Water clock|water-powered]] [[astronomical clock]]s which displayed moving models of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[star]]s. His largest astronomical clock was the "castle clock".<ref name="Ancient Discoveries"/>

;''Mechanical observational clock''

[[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] invented the "observational clock", which he described as "a mechanical [[clock]] with three [[Dial (measurement)|dials]] which show the [[hour]]s, the [[minute]]s, and the [[second]]s." This was the first clock to measure time in seconds, and he used it for astronomical purposes, specifically for measuring the [[right ascension]] of the [[star]]s. This is considered one of the most important innovations in 16th-century practical astronomy, as previous clocks were not accurate enough to be used for astronomical purposes.<ref name=Tekeli/> He further improved the observational clock, as described in his ''Sidrat al-muntaha'', using only one dial to represent the hours, minutes and seconds. He describes this observational clock as "a mechanical clock with a dial showing the hours, minutes and seconds and we divided every minute into five seconds."<ref name=Sayili>{{citation|first=Aydin|last=Sayili|authorlink=Aydin Sayili|title=The Observatory in Islam|year=1991|pages=289<U+2013>305|isbn=0405139519}}</ref>

===Dials===
Muslim astronomers and engineers invented a variety of [[Sundial|dials]] for [[timekeeping]], and for determining the times of the [[Salat|five daily prayers]].

;''Sundials''

Muslims made several important improvements to the theory and construction of [[sundial]]s, which they inherited from their [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] predecessors. [[Al-Khwarizmi]] made tables for these instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations. Sundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the [[Salat times|time of prayer]]. One of the most striking examples was built in the 14th century by the ''muwaqqit'' (timekeeper) of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], [[Ibn al-Shatir]].<ref>{{Harv|King|1999a|pp=168<U+2013>9}}</ref> Muslim astronomers and engineers were the first to write instructions on the construction of vertical sundials and polar sundials.<ref name=King-Astronomy>{{citation|first=David A.|last=King|contribution=Astronomy and Islamic society|pages=163<U+2013>8}}, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=128<U+2013>184}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}

Since ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines, they indicated unequal hours <U+2014> also called temporary hours <U+2014> that varied with the seasons, since every day was divided into twelve equal segments; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. Abu'l-Hasan [[Ibn al-Shatir]] was aware that "using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year." His fragments of his sundial in a Damascus museum is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept later appeared in Western sundials from at least 1446.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the sundial|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.353|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=The Sundial And Geometry|first=Lawrence|last=Jones|journal=North American Sundial Society|volume=12|issue=4|date=December 2005}}</ref>

;''Navicula de Venetiis''

This was a universal horary [[Sundial|dial]] invented in the 9th century [[Baghdad]]. It was used for accurate timekeeping by the Sun and Stars, and could be observed from any [[latitude]].<ref>{{Harv|King|2005}}</ref> This was later known in Europe as the "Navicula de Venetiis",<ref>{{Harv|King|2003}}</ref> which was considered the most sophisticated timekeeping instrument of the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=King/>

;''Compass dial''

In the 13th century, [[Ibn al-Shatir]] devised a [[time]]keeping device incorporating both a universal [[sundial]] and a magnetic [[compass]] for the purpose of finding the times of [[Salah]] prayers.<ref>{{Harv|King|1983|pp=547<U+2013>548}}</ref>

===Globes===
[[File:Armillary sphere.png|thumb|right|An [[armillary sphere]].]]
;''Armillary sphere''

An [[armillary sphere]] had similar applications to a [[celestial globe]]. No early Islamic armillary spheres survive, but several treatises on <U+201C>the instrument with the rings<U+201D> were written.

[[File:Spherical astrolabe.jpg|thumb|left|The [[spherical astrolabe]] was invented by Islamic astronomers.]]

;''Spherical astrolabe''

The [[spherical astrolabe]] was first produced in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]].<ref>Emilie Savage-Smith (1993). "Book Reviews", ''Journal of Islamic Studies'' '''4''' (2): 296<U+2013>299.
{{quote|"There is no evidence for the Hellenistic origin of the spherical astrolabe, but rather evidence so far available suggests that it may have been an early but distinctly Islamic development with no Greek antecedents."}}</ref> It was an Islamic variation of the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, of which only one complete instrument, from the 14th century, has survived.

;''Celestial globes''

[[Celestial globe]]s were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the sun, or the [[Right Ascension]] and [[Declination]] of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] ring of the [[globe]].

In the 12th century, [[Jabir ibn Aflah]] (Geber) was "the first to design a portable celestial sphere to measure and explain the movements of celestial objects."

;''Seamless celestial globe''

The [[Seam (metallurgy)|seamless]] [[celestial globe]] invented by Muslim metallurgists and instrument-makers in [[Mughal India]], specifically [[Lahore]] and [[Kashmir]], is considered to be one of the most remarkable feats in [[metallurgy]] and [[engineering]]. All [[globe]]s before and after this were seamed, and in the 20th century, it was believed by metallurgists to be technically impossible to create a metal globe without any [[Seam (metallurgy)|seams]]. It was in the 1980s, however, that Emilie Savage-Smith discovered several celestial globes without any seams in Lahore and Kashmir. The earliest was invented in Kashmir by the Muslim metallurgist [[Ali Kashmiri ibn Luqman]] in 998 AH (1589<U+2013>90 CE) during [[Akbar the Great]]'s reign; another was produced in 1070 AH (1659<U+2013>60 CE) by the [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] Astronomer [[Muhammad Salih Tahtawi]] with Arabic and Persian inscriptions during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]]. 21 such globes were produced, and these remain the only examples of seamless metal globes. These Mughal metallurgists developed the method of [[lost-wax casting]] in order to produce these globes.<ref>{{citation|first=Emilie|last=Savage-Smith|title=Islamicate Celestial Globes: Their History, Construction, and Use|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C.|year=1985}}</ref>

These seamless celestial globes are considered to be an unsurpassed feat in metallurgy, hence some consider this achievement to be comparable to that of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] which was considered an unsurpassed feat in [[architecture]] until the 19th century.

===Optical instruments===
;''Observation tube''
The first reference to an "observation tube" is found in the work of [[al-Battani]] (Albatenius) (853<U+2013>929), and the first exact description of the observation tube was given by [[al-Biruni]] (973<U+2013>1048), in a section of his work that is "dedicated to verifying the presence of the new crescent on the horizon." Though these early observation tubes did not have [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], they "enabled an observer to focus on a part of the sky by eliminating [[light]] interference." These observation tubes were later adopted in [[Latin]]-speaking Europe, where they influenced the development of the [[telescope]].<ref>Regis Morelon, "General Survey of Arabic Astronomy", pp. 9<U+2013>10, in {{Harv|Rashed|Morelon|1996|pp=1<U+2013>19}}</ref>

;''Experimental device with apertures''
In order to prove that "[[light]] is emitted from every point of the [[moon]]'s illuminated surface," [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) built an "ingenious [[experiment]]al device" showing "that the [[radiance|intensity]] of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[aperture]]s onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up."<ref name=Toomer/>

;''Magnifying lens''
The first [[Optics|optical]] research to describe a [[magnifying lens]] used in an instrument was found in a book called the ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021) written by [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen).<ref name= Sabra2>Sabra, A.

(2003), The Enterprise of Science in Islam: New Perspectives, MIT Press, pp. 85<U+2013>118, ISBN 0262194821</ref> His descriptions were fundamental to the development of the telescope and helped set the parameters in [[Europe]] for the later advances in telescopic technology.<ref>O. S. Marshall (1950). "Alhazen and the Telescope", Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets 6, p. 4</ref> His additional work in light [[refraction]], [[parabolic mirror]]s, as well as the creation of other instruments such as the [[camera obscura]], also helped spark the [[Scientific Revolution]].<ref name="Sabra2"/><ref>[[Richard Powers]] (University of Illinois), Best Idea; Eyes Wide OpenNew York Times, April 18, 1999.</ref>

===Quadrants===
A number of [[mural instrument]]s, including several different [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]] and [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]]s, were invented by Muslim astronomers and engineers.

[[File:Tycho instrument augsburg quadrant 20.jpg|thumb|The [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] was invented by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>]]. This illustration was drawn by [[Tycho Brahe]].]]

;''Sine quadrant''

The sine [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], invented by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>]] in the 9th century [[Baghdad]], was used for astronomical calculations.<ref name=King-2002/> Also known as the "Sinecal Quadrant" (the Arabic term for it is "Rubul Mujayyab"), it was used for solving trigonometric problems and taking astronomical observations. It was developed by al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century and remained prevalent until the 19th century. Its defining feature is a [[graph paper]] like grid on one side that is divided into sixty equal intervals on each axis and is also bounded by a 90 degree graduated arc. A cord was attached to the apex of the quadrant with a bead at the end of it to act as a plumb bob. They were also sometimes drawn on the back of astrolabes.<ref name=King-1987>{{citation|last=King|first=David A.|year=1987|title=Islamic Astronomical Instruments|publisher=Variorum|publication-place=London|isbn=1558997989}}</ref>

;''Horary quadrant''

The first horary quadrant for specific [[latitude]]s, was invented by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>]] in the 9th century Baghdad, center of the development of quadrants.<ref name=King-2002/> It was used to determine time (especially the times of prayer) by observations of the Sun or stars.<ref>{{Harv|King|1999a|pp=167<U+2013>8}}</ref> The horary quadrant could be used to find the time either in equal or unequal (length of the day divided by twelve) hours. Different sets of markings were created for either equal or unequal hours. For measuring the time in equal hours, the horary quadrant could only be used for one specific latitude while a quadrant for unequal hours could be used anywhere based on an approximate formula. One edge of the quadrant had to be aligned with the sun, and once aligned, a bead on the end of a plumbline attached to the centre of the quadrant showed the time of the day.<ref name=King-1987/>

;''Universal horary quadrant (Quadrans Novus)''

The universal horary quadrant was an ingenious mathematical device invented by [[al-Khwarizmi]] in the 9th century [[Baghdad]] and which was later known as the "Quadrans Vetus" (Old Quadrant) in medieval Europe from the 13th century. It could be used for any [[latitude]] on Earth and at any time of the year to determine the time in hours from the [[altitude]] of the Sun. This was the second most widely used astronomical instrument during the [[Middle Ages]] after the astrolabe. One of its main purposes in the Islamic world was to determine the times of [[Salah]].<ref name=King-2002>{{Harv|King|2002|pp=237<U+2013>238}}</ref>

;''Astrolabic/Almucantar quadrant (Quadrans Vetus)''

The astrolabic or [[almucantar]] quadrant was invented in the medieval Islamic world, and it employed the use of [[trigonometry]]. The term "almucantar" is itself derived from Arabic.<ref>Elly Dekker (1995), "An unrecorded medieval astrolabe quadrant from c. 1300", ''Annals of Science'' '''52''' (1): 1<U+2013>47 [6].</ref> The almucantar quadrant was originally modified from the [[astrolabe]].<ref name=King-Astronomy/> It was invented in [[Egypt]] in the 11th or 12th century, and was later known in Europe as the "Quadrans Vetus" (New Quadrant).<ref>{{Harv|King|Cleempoel|Moreno|2002|p=333}}</ref> It was intended as a simplified alternative to the astrolabe serving a specific latitude. According to David King:<ref name=King-1983-533>{{Harv|King|1983|p=533}}</ref>

{{quote|"This was an invention of some consequence, for the astrolabe, fitted with a series of plates for different latitudes, was neither a practical device nor an accurate observational instrument. Also, being made of brass, it was expensive. The almucantar quadrant, on the other hand, could be made of wood and was an extremely practical device with which one could solve all the problems solvable with an astrolabe, for a particular latitude. The back of such a quandrant could carry a trigonometric grid called a sine quadrant for solving all manner of computational problems."}}

;''Universal quadrant (Shakk<U+0101>z<U+012B>ya)''

The universal (shakk<U+0101>z<U+012B>ya) quadrant was used for solving astronomical problems for any latitude. These quadrants had either one or two sets of shakk<U+0101>z<U+012B>ya grids and were developed in the 14th century in [[Syria]]. Some astrolabes are also printed on the back with the universal quadrant like an astrolabe created by Ibn al-Sarr<U+0101>j.<ref name=King-1987/> The Shakkaziya quadrant produced by Jamal al-Din al-Maridini was an [[analog computer]] for solving problems of spherical astronomy.<ref>{{citation|last=King|first=David A.|year=1974|title=An analog computer for solving problems of spherical astronomy: The Shakkaziya quadrant of Jamal al-Din al-Maridini|journal=Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences (International Archives on the History of Science)|volume=24|pages=219<U+2013>42}}</ref> By the time of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]], Muslim astronomers "developed the quadrant to all conceivable limits; it virtually replaced the astrolabe in Syria and Egypt in Mamluk and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] times."<ref name=King-1983-533/>

===Sextants===
;''Mural sextant''

The first [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]] was constructed in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], Iran, by [[Abu-Mahmud al-Khujandi]] in 994. It was a very large [[Mural instrument|mural]] sextant that achieved a high level of accuracy for [[astronomy|astronomical]] measurements, which he described his in his treatise, ''On the obliquity of the ecliptic and the latitudes of the cities''.<ref>{{MacTutor|id=Al-Khujandi|title=Al-Khujandi}}</ref>

;''Fakhri sextant''

In the 15th century, [[Ulugh Beg]] constructed the Fakhri sextant, which had a radius of approximately 36 meters. Constructed in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]], the arc was finely constructed with a staircase on either side to provide access for the assistants who performed the measurements.

;''Framed sextant''

At the [[Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din]] between 1577 and 1580, [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] invented the ''mushabbaha bi'l manattiq'', a framed sextant with cords for the determination of the [[equinox]]es similar to what [[Tycho Brahe]] later used.<ref name=Tekeli>{{cite encyclopedia|first = Sevim|last = Tekeli|title = Taqi al-Din|year = 1997|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|publisher = [[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]|isbn = 0792340663|url = http://www.springer.com/philosophy/philosophy+of+sciences/book/978-1-4020-4425-0}}</ref>

===Other instruments===
Various other astronomical instruments were also invented in the Islamic world:

*'''[[Alhidade]]''': The alhidade was invented in the Islamic world, while the term "alhidade" is itself derived from Arabic.
*'''[[Compendium]] instrument''': A compendium was a multi-purpose astronomical instrument, first constructed by the Muslim astronomer [[Ibn al-Shatir]] in the 13th century. His compendium featured an [[alhidade]] and polar [[sundial]] among other things. Al-Wafa'i developed another compendium in the 15th century which he called the "equatorial circle", which also featured a horizontal sundial. These compendia later became popular in [[Renaissance]] Europe.<ref name=King-Astronomy/>
*'''[[Orthogonality|Orthogonal]] and [[regular grid]]s''': Islamic [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrants]] used for various astronomical and timekeeping purposes from the 10th century introduced [[orthogonal]] and [[regular grid]]s and markings that are identical to modern [[graph paper]].<ref>Josef W. Meri (2006), ''Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia'', p. 75, [[Taylor and Francis]], ISBN 0415966914.</ref><ref>{{Harv|King|1999b|p=17}}</ref>
*'''[[Qibla]] indicators''': In the 17th century [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Persia]], two unique [[brass]] instruments with [[Mecca]]-centred [[world map]]s engraved on them were produced primarily for the purpose of finding the [[Qibla]]. These instruments were engraved with [[Cartography|cartographic]] [[Grid reference|grids]] to make it more convenient to find the direction and distance to Mecca at the centre from anywhere on the Earth, which may be based on cartographic grids dating back to 10th century [[Baghdad]].<ref name=King>{{Harv|King|2004}}</ref> One of the two instruments, produced by Muhammad Husayn,<ref>{{Harv|Iqbal|2003}}</ref> also had a [[sundial]] and [[compass]] attached to it.<ref>{{Harv|King|1997|p=62}}</ref>
*'''[[Shadow square]]''': The shadow square was an instrument used to determine the linear height of an object, in conjunction with the [[alidade]], for angular observations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/search/lightbox.cfm/category/90286|title=Shadow square|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=2008-01-22}}</ref> It was invented by [[Muhammad ibn M<U+016B>s<U+0101> al-Khw<U+0101>rizm<U+012B>]] in the 9th century Baghdad.<ref>{{Harv|King|2002|pp=238<U+2013>239}}</ref>

===Almanacs===
The word "[[Almanac]]" is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word.<ref>{{Harv|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=29}}</ref> The modern almanac differs from earlier astronomical tables (such as the earlier [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian]], Ptolemaic and [[Zij]] tables) in the sense that "the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation", in contrast to the more common "auxiliary astronomical tables" based on Ptolemy's ''Almagest''. The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the ''Almanac of Azarqueil'' written in 1087 by [[Ab<U+016B> Ish<U+0101>q Ibr<U+0101>h<U+012B>m al-Zarq<U+0101>l<U+012B>]] (Latinized as Azarqueil) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Al-Andalus]]. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun, moon and planets for four years from 1088 to 1092, as well as many other related tables. A [[Latin]] translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the ''[[Tables of Toledo]]'' in the 12th century and the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' in the 13th century.<ref>{{Harv|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=30}}</ref>

===Treatises on instruments===
In the 12th century, [[al-Khazini]] wrote the ''Risala fi'l-alat'' (''Treatise on Instruments'') which has seven parts describing different [[scientific instrument]]s: the [[Triquetrum (astronomy)|triquetrum]], [[dioptra]], a "triangular instrument", the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], the astrolabe, and instruments involving [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].<ref>Robert E. Hall (1973). "al-Kh<U+0101>zin<U+012B>", ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', Vol. VII, p. 338b.</ref>

In the 14th century [[Egypt]], Najm al-Din al-Misri (c. 1325) wrote a treatise describing over 100 different types of scientific and astronomical instruments, many of which he invented himself.<ref name=King/>

In 1416, [[al-Kashi]] wrote the ''Treatise on Astronomical Observational Instruments'', which described a variety of different instruments, including the [[Triquetrum (astronomy)|triquetrum]] and [[armillary sphere]], the [[Equinox|equinoctial]] armillary and [[Solstice|solsticial]] armillary of [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]], the [[sine]] and [[versine]] instrument of Urdi, the [[Sextant (astronomical)|sextant]] of [[al-Khujandi]], the Fakhri sextant at the [[Samarqand]] observatory, a double quadrant [[Azimuth]]-[[altitude]] instrument he invented, and a small armillary sphere incorporating an [[alhidade]] which he invented.<ref>{{Harv|Kennedy|1961|pp=104<U+2013>107}}</ref>

==Arabic star names==
{{Main|List of Arabic star names}}

Many of the modern names for numerous [[star]]s and [[constellation]]s are derived from their [[Arabic language]] names. Examples include: [[Acamar]], [[Aldebaran]], [[Algol]], [[Altair]], [[Theta Pegasi|Baham]], [[Baten Kaitos]], [[Caph]], [[Dabih]], [[Edasich]], [[Furud]], [[Gienah]], [[Beta Centauri|Hadar]], [[Epsilon Bo<U+00F6>tis|Izar]], [[Jabbah]], [[Keid]], [[Lesath]], [[Epsilon Bo<U+00F6>tis|Mirak]], [[Nashira]], [[Okda]], [[Phad]], [[Rigel]], [[Gamma Cygni|Sadr]], [[Tarf]], and [[Vega]], as well as a number of other stars. Some of these names originated in the pre-Islamic [[Arabian Peninsula]], but many came later, some as translations of [[ancient Greek]] descriptions and others of unknown origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astro.isi.edu/reference/starnames.txt|title=Arabic Star names}}</ref>
