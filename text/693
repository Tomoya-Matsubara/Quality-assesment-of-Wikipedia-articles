[[Oghuz Turks]] began migrating into the area now called Turkey (derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia'', i.e. "Land of the Turks") in the 11th century. The process was greatly accelerated by the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]] victory over the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/turkey/5.htm |title=Turkey <U+2013> Turkish Origins |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref> Several small [[Anatolian beyliks|beyliks]] and the [[Sultanate of R<U+00FB>m|Seljuk Sultanate of R<U+00FB>m]] ruled Anatolia until the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion. Starting from the 13th century, the [[Ottomans|Ottoman beylik]] united Anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of Southeastern Europe, Western Asia and North Africa. After the [[Ottoman Empire]] collapsed following its defeat in [[World War I|World War&nbsp;I]], parts of it were occupied by the victorious [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. A cadre of young military officers, led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk]] and his colleagues, organized a successful resistance to the Allies; in 1923, they would establish the modern Republic of Turkey with Atat<U+00FC>rk as its first president.

Turkey is a [[democracy|democratic]], [[secular state|secular]], [[unitary state|unitary]], [[constitutional republic]] with an ancient cultural heritage. Turkey has become increasingly integrated with the [[Western world|West]] through membership in organisations such as the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], [[OECD]], [[OSCE]] and the [[G-20 major economies]]. Turkey began [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|full membership negotiations]] with the [[European Union]] in 2005, having been an [[Ankara Agreement|associate member]] of the [[European Economic Community]] since 1963 and having reached a [[European Union <U+2013> Turkey Customs Union|customs union agreement]] in 1995. Turkey has also fostered close cultural, political, economic and industrial relations with the Middle East, the [[List of Turkic states and empires|Turkic states]] of Central Asia and the African countries through membership in organisations such as the [[Turkic Council]], [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Economic Cooperation Organisation]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Turkey}}

The name of Turkey, ''T<U+00FC>rkiye'' in the [[Turkish language]], can be divided into two components: the [[ethnonym]] ''[[Turkic peoples|T<U+00FC>rk]]'' and the abstract suffix ''<U+2013>iye'' meaning "owner", "land of" or "related to" (derived from the [[Arabic grammar#Nisba|Arabic suffix]] ''<U+2013>iyya'', which is similar to the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] suffixes ''<U+2013>ia''). The first recorded use of the term "T<U+00FC>rk" or "T<U+00FC>r<U+00FC>k" as an [[exonym and endonym|autonym]] is contained in the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon inscriptions]] of the [[G<U+00F6>kt<U+00FC>rks]] (''Celestial Turks'') of Central Asia (c. 8th century). The English word "Turkey" is derived from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia'' (c. 1369).<ref name="TurkEtymology">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Turk|title=Turk|first=Douglas|last=Harper|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2011-05-24|year=2001}}</ref> The Greek [[cognate]] of this name, ''[[Tourkia]]'' ({{lang-el|<U+03A4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BA><U+03AF><U+03B1>}}) was originally used by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] to [[Holy Crown of Hungary#Corona Gr<U+00E6>ca|describe medieval Hungary]]<ref group=dn>On the right side of the ''[[Holy Crown of Hungary#Corona Gr<U+00E6>ca|Corona Gr<U+00E6>ca]]'' in the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], there is a picture of the Hungarian King [[G<U+00E9>za I]] (1074<U+2013>1077), with the Byzantine Greek inscription: "<U+0393><U+0395><U+03A9><U+0392><U+0399><U+03A4>Z<U+0391>C <U+03A0><U+0399><U+03A3><U+03A4><U+039F>C <U+039A><U+03A1><U+0391><U+039B><U+0397>C <U+03A4><U+039F><U+03A5><U+03A1><U+039A><U+0399><U+0391>C" (''Ge<U+014D>vitzas pist<U+00F3>s kr<U+00E1>l<U+0113>s Tourk<U+00ED>as'', meaning "[[G<U+00E9>za I]], faithful [[kralj]] of the [[Hungary|land of the Turks]]").

Similarly, the medieval [[Khazars|Khazar Empire]], a Turkic state on the northern shores of the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] seas, was referred to as ''[[Tourkia]]'' (''Land of the Turks'') in Byzantine sources. However, the Byzantines later began using this name to define the [[Sultanate of Rum|Seljuk]]-controlled parts of [[Anatolia]] in the centuries that followed the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.

The settlement of [[Troy]] started in the Neolithic and continued into the [[Iron Age]]. Through recorded history, Anatolians have spoken [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and [[Kartvelian languages]], as well as many languages of uncertain affiliation. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European [[Hittite language|Hittite]] and [[Luwian language|Luwian]] languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical center from which the Indo-European languages radiated.<ref name="AnatoliaIndoEuropean">{{Cite journal|last=Balter|first=Michael|title=Search for the Indo-Europeans: Were Kurgan horsemen or Anatolian farmers responsible for creating and spreading the world's most far-flung language family?|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=303|issue=5662|page=1323|date=2004-02-27|doi=10.1126/science.303.5662.1323|pmid=14988549}}</ref> The [[Hattians]] were an ancient people who inhabited the Central Anatolia, noted at least as early as  ca. 2300.

The first major empire in the area was founded by the [[Hittites]], from the eighteenth through the 13th century BC. The [[Assyria]]ns colonized parts of southeastern Turkey as far back as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC, when the Assyrian Empire was conquered by the [[Chaldea|Chaldean dynasty]] in [[Babylon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.uakron.edu/ziyaret/timeline_3period.html |title=Ziyaret Tepe <U+2013> Turkey Archaeological Dig Site |publisher=uakron.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/assyrianidentity.pdf |title=Assyrian Identity In Ancient Times And Today' |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-04}}</ref> Following the Hittite collapse, the [[Phrygia]]ns, an Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy until their kingdom was destroyed by the [[Cimmerians]] in the 7th century BC.<ref name="TroyHittiteEmpirePhrygians">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/03/waa/ht03waa.htm|title=Anatolia and the Caucasus, 2000<U+2013>1000 B.C. in ''Timeline of Art History.''|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|authorlink=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2006-12-21|month=October|year=2000}}</ref> The most powerful of Phrygia's successor states were [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]].

Starting around 1200 BC, the coast of [[Anatolia]] was heavily settled by [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] and [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Greeks]]. Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists, such as [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Smyrna]] (modern [[<U+0130>zmir]]), and [[Byzantium]] (later [[Constantinople]] and [[Istanbul]]). The first state established in Anatolia that was called [[Armenia]] by neighboring peoples ([[Hecataeus of Miletus]] and [[Behistun Inscription]]) was the state of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Orontid dynasty]]. Anatolia was conquered by the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the 6th and 5th centuries BC and later fell to [[Alexander the Great]] in 334 BC.<ref name="PersiansInAsiaMinor">{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/GREECE/PERSIAN.HTM|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uNLYWJA2|archivedate=2010-11-20|title=Ancient Greece: The Persian Wars|author=Hooker, Richard|publisher=Washington State University, Washington, United States|accessdate=2006-12-22|date=1999-06-06}}</ref> Anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic kingdoms]] (including [[Bithynia]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Pergamon|Pergamum]], and [[Pontus]]), all of which had succumbed to the [[Roman Republic]] by the mid-1st century BC.<ref name="AlexanderToRome">{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/04/waa/ht04waa.htm|title=Anatolia and the Caucasus (Asia Minor), 1000 B.C. <U+2013> 1 A.D. in ''Timeline of Art History.''|author=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York|authorlink=Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2006-12-21|month=October|year=2000}}</ref> 

In 324, the Roman emperor [[Constantine I]] chose [[Byzantium]] to be the new capital of the [[Roman Empire]], renaming it [[New Rome]] (later [[Constantinople]] and [[Istanbul]]).

In the 11th century, the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homelands towards the eastern regions of Anatolia, which eventually became the new homeland of Oghuz Turkic tribes following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The victory of the Seljuks gave rise to the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]]; which developed as a separate branch of the larger [[Seljuk Empire]] that covered parts of Central Asia, Iran, Anatolia and [[Southwest Asia]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford History of Byzantium|first=Cyril|last=Mango|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=2002|isbn=0-19-814098-3}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], causing the Seljuk empire's power to slowly disintegrate. In its wake, one of the Turkish principalities governed by [[Osman I]] would, over the next 200 years, evolve into the [[Ottoman Empire]], expanding throughout [[Anatolia]], the [[Balkans]] and the [[Levant]].<ref name="Ottomans">{{Cite book|title=The Ottoman Centuries: The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire|first=Patrick|last=Kinross|publisher=Morrow|year=1977|isbn=0-6880-3093-9}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} In 1453, the Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine Empire by capturing its capital, [[Constantinople]].

The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].  The empire was often at odds with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in its steady advance towards [[Central Europe]] through the Balkans and the southern part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="Ottoman_Turkey">{{Cite book|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|first=Stanford|last=Jay Shaw|coauthors=Kural Shaw, Ezel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=0-5212-9163-1}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=July 2011}} At sea, the empire contended with the Holy Leagues, composed of [[Habsburg Spain]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Knights of St. John]], for control of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. In the [[Indian Ocean]], the Ottoman navy frequently confronted [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fleets in order to defend its traditional monopoly over the maritime trade routes between [[East Asia]] and [[Western Europe]]; these routes faced new competition with the Portuguese discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488.  In addition, the Ottomans were occasionally at war with Persia over territorial disputes or caused by religious differences between 16th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Short History of the Middle East| first=George E. |last=Kirk|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|year=2008|page=58|isbn=1443725684}}</ref>

During nearly two [[Decline of the Ottoman Empire|centuries of decline]], the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, military power, and wealth. It entered World War I on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated.

The [[occupation of Constantinople]] and [[Occupation of Smyrna|Smyrna]] by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the [[establishment of the Turkish national movement]].<ref name="Ottoman_Turkey" /> Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Mustafa Kemal]] [[Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres.<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk"/>

By September 18, 1922, the occupying armies were expelled, and the new Turkish state was established. On November 1, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|newly founded parliament]] formally abolished the [[Sultan]]ate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] of July 24, 1923, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed "Republic of Turkey" as the [[successor state]] of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923, in the new capital of [[Ankara]].<ref name="Ottoman_Turkey" />

Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first [[President of Turkey|President]] and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past.<ref name="Ottoman_Turkey" /> With the [[Surname Law (Turkey)|Surname Law]] of 1934, the [[Turkish Parliament]] bestowed upon Mustafa Kemal the honorific surname "Atat<U+00FC>rk" (''Father of the Turks''.)<ref name="Atat<U+00FC>rk" />

[[Human rights in Turkey]] have been the subject of much controversy and international condemnation. Between 1998 and 2008 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly the right to life and freedom from torture.

In line with its traditional Western orientation, relations with Europe have always been a central part of Turkish foreign policy.

Since 1974, Turkey has not recognized the (essentially Greek Cypriot) [[Republic of Cyprus]] as the sole authority on the island, but instead supports the [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish Cypriot community]] in the form of the de facto [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] which is recognized only by Turkey.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6170749.stm |title=Turkey's EU membership bid stalls|first=Mark|last=Mardell|authorlink=Mark Mardell|work=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-17|date=2006-12-11}}</ref>

The other defining aspect of Turkey's foreign relations has been its ties with the United States. Based on the common threat posed by the Soviet Union, Turkey joined NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington throughout the [[Cold War]]. In the post<U+2013>Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Balkans]]. In return, Turkey has benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key issues such as the country's bid to join the European Union.

The independence of the [[Turkic states]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into [[Central Asia]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Turkish Foreign Policy In Post Cold War Era|first=Idris|last=Bal|publisher=Universal Publishers|location= |year=2004|isbn=1-5811-2423-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vDzjkrTDKjYC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&dq=turkey+cold+war }}</ref> thus enabling the completion of a multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from [[Baku]] in [[Azerbaijan]] to the port of [[Ceyhan]] in Turkey.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|List of regions of Turkey|Provinces of Turkey|Districts of Turkey|List of cities in Turkey}}
{{Turkey Labelled Map|float=right}}

The [[capital city]] of Turkey is [[Ankara]]. The territory of Turkey is subdivided into 81 provinces for administrative purposes. The provinces are organized into 7 [[Regions of Turkey|regions]] for [[Census#Turkey|census]] purposes; however, they do not represent an administrative structure. Each province is divided into districts, for a total of 923 districts.

Provinces usually bear the same name as their provincial capitals, also called the central district; exceptions to this custom are the provinces of [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] (capital: [[Antakya]]), [[Kocaeli Province|Kocaeli]] (capital: [[<U+0130>zmit]]) and [[Sakarya Province|Sakarya]] (capital: [[Adapazar<U+0131>]]). Provinces with the largest populations are [[Istanbul]] (13 million), [[Ankara Province|Ankara]] (5 million), [[<U+0130>zmir Province|<U+0130>zmir]] (4 million), [[Bursa Province|Bursa]] (3 million) and [[Adana Province|Adana]] (2 million).

The biggest city and the pre-Republican capital [[Istanbul]] is the financial, economic and cultural heart of the country.<ref name="USLC_TRGeo" /> An estimated 75.5% of Turkey's population live in urban centers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Turkish Statistical Institute|authorlink=Turkish Statistical Institute|publisher=Turkish Statistical Institute|url=http://www.turkstat.gov.tr/PreHaberBultenleri.do?id=6178|title=2009 Census, population living in cities |accessdate=2010-01-25|year=2010}}</ref> In all, 19 provinces have populations that exceed 1 million inhabitants, and 20 provinces have populations between 1 million and 500,000 inhabitants.

The European section of Turkey, [[East Thrace]], forms the borders of Turkey with Greece and Bulgaria. The Asian part of the country, [[Anatolia]], consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the K<U+00F6>ro<U+011F>lu and [[Pontic Mountains|Pontic]] mountain ranges to the north and the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the south. Eastern Turkey has a more mountainous landscape and is home to the sources of rivers such as the [[Euphrates]], [[Tigris]] and [[Aras River|Aras]], and contains [[Lake Van]] and [[Mount Ararat]], Turkey's highest point at 5,165 metres (16,946&nbsp;ft).<ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=4996|title=Mount Ararat (A<U+011F>r<U+0131> Da<U+011F><U+0131>), Turkey|author=NASA <U+2013> Earth Observatory|authorlink=NASA|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2006-12-27|year=2001}}</ref> [[Lake Tuz]], Turkey's third-largest lake, is a macroscopically visible feature in the middle of the country.

The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.<ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism">{{cite web|url=http://www.turizm.net/turkey/info/geography.html|title=Geography of Turkey|author=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|publisher=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|accessdate=2006-12-13|year=2005}}</ref>

Turkey's varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent [[earthquake]]s and occasional [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. The [[Bosporus]] and the [[Dardanelles]] owe their existence to the [[geologic fault|fault lines]] running through Turkey that led to the creation of the Black Sea. There is an earthquake fault line across the north of the country from west to east, which caused [[1999 <U+0130>zmit earthquake|a major earthquake]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/civil_eng/structural_lab/eq-rp/seismicity.html|title=Brief Seismic History of Turkey|publisher=University of South California, Department of Civil Engineering|accessdate=2006-12-26|date=}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate of Turkey|Environmental issues in Turkey}}

The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea have a [[temperate]] [[Mediterranean climate]], with hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet winters. The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Black Sea have a temperate [[Oceanic climate]] with warm, wet summers and cool to cold, wet winters. The Turkish Black Sea coast receives the greatest amount of precipitation and is the only region of Turkey that receives high precipitation throughout the year. The eastern part of that coast averages 2,500 millimetres annually which is the highest precipitation in the country.

The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Sea of Marmara (including Istanbul), which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate Oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow does occur on the coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but it usually lies no more than a few days. Snow on the other hand is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.

Conditions can be much harsher in the more arid interior. Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian plateau of the interior of Turkey a [[continental climate]] with sharply contrasting [[season]]s.

Winters on the plateau are especially severe. Temperatures of <U+2212>30 [[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] to <U+2212>40 <U+00B0>C (<U+2212>22 <U+00B0>[[Fahrenheit|F]] to <U+2212>40 <U+00B0>F) can occur in eastern Anatolia, and snow may lie on the ground at least 120 days of the year. In the west, winter temperatures average below 1 <U+00B0>C (34 <U+00B0>F). Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures generally above 30 <U+00B0>C (86 <U+00B0>F) in the day. Annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] averages about 400 millimetres (15 [[inch|in]]), with actual amounts determined by elevation. The driest regions are the Konya plain and the Malatya plain, where annual rainfall frequently is less than 300 millimetres (12&nbsp;in). May is generally the wettest month, whereas July and August are the driest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20080419130806/http://www.meteor.gov.tr/2006/english/eng-climateofturkey.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070110140758/http://www.meteor.gov.tr/2006/english/eng-climateofturkey.aspx|archivedate=2007-01-10|title=Climate of Turkey|author=Turkish State Meteorological Service|authorlink=Turkish State Meteorological Service|publisher=Turkish State Meteorological Service|accessdate=2006-12-27|year=2006}}</ref>

Turkey has taken advantage of the [[European Union <U+2013> Turkey Customs Union]], signed in 1995, to increase its industrial production destined for exports, while at the same time benefiting from EU-origin foreign investment into the country.

Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of the [[Turkic peoples|O<U+011F>uz Turkic]], [[Anatolia]]n, [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (which was itself a continuation of both [[Greco-Roman]] and [[Islamic]] cultures) and [[Western culture]] and traditions, which started with the [[Tanzimat|Westernisation of the Ottoman Empire]] and still continues today. This mix originally began as a result of the encounter of Turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during [[Turkic migration|their migration]] from Central Asia to the West.<ref name="TR_culture" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turks.org.uk/index.php?pid=8|title=Turks <U+2013> A Journey of a Thousand Years: 600<U+2013>1600|author=Royal Academy of Arts|authorlink=Royal Academy of Arts|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|accessdate=2006-12-12|year=2005}}</ref>

As Turkey successfully transformed from the religion-based former Ottoman Empire into a modern nation-state with a very strong separation of state and religion, an increase in the modes of artistic expression followed. During the first years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts; such as museums, theatres, opera houses and architecture. Diverse historical factors play important roles in defining the modern Turkish identity. Turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a "modern" Western state, while maintaining traditional religious and historical values.<ref name="TR_culture">{{Cite book|title=Social Theory and Later Modernities: The Turkish Experience|first=<U+0130>brahim|last=Kaya|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-8532-3898-7|url=http://books.google.com/?id=0Iy7pJBRgjYC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=Turkish+culture}}</ref>

[[File:DolmabahceMainGate.JPG|thumb|One of the main entrance gates of the [[Dolmabah<U+00E7>e Palace]] in Istanbul.]]
[[Music of Turkey|Turkish music]] and [[Turkish literature|literature]] form great examples of such a mix of cultural influences, which were a result of the interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe, thus contributing to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkmusikisi.com/osmanli_musikisi/the_ottoman_music.htm|title=The Ottoman music|author=Cinu<U+00E7>en Tanr<U+0131>korur|authorlink=Cinu<U+00E7>en Tanr<U+0131>korur|publisher=www.turkmusikisi.com|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=}}</ref> Turkish literature was heavily influenced by [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Arabic literature]] during most of the Ottoman era, though towards the end of the Ottoman Empire, particularly after the [[Tanzimat]] period, the effect of both Turkish folk and European literary traditions became increasingly felt. The mix of cultural influences is dramatized, for example, in the form of the "new symbols [of] the clash and interlacing of cultures" enacted in the works of [[Orhan Pamuk]], winner of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|work=BBC|accessdate=2006-12-12|date=2006-10-12}}</ref> According to Konda public opinion researchers, 70% of Turkish citizens never read books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97615 |title=70 percent of Turkish citizens never read book |author=Azeri-Press Agency (APA)|date=23 Feb 2009  |work= |publisher= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref>

Architectural elements found in Turkey are also testaments to the unique mix of traditions that have influenced the region over the centuries. In addition to the traditional [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine elements]] present in numerous parts of Turkey, many artifacts of the later [[Ottoman architecture]], with its exquisite blend of local and Islamic traditions, are to be found throughout the country, as well as in many former territories of the Ottoman Empire. [[Mimar Sinan]] is widely regarded as the greatest architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture. Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by Western styles, and this can be particularly seen in Istanbul where buildings like [[Dolmabah<U+00E7>e Palace|Dolmabah<U+00E7>e]] and [[<U+00C7><U+0131>ra<U+011F>an Palace]]s are juxtaposed next to numerous modern skyscrapers, all of them representing different traditions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Ottoman Architecture|first=Godfrey|last=Goodwin|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2003|isbn=0-5002-7429-0|url=}}</ref>

[[File:Atat<U+00FC>rk Olympic Stadium Istanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Atat<U+00FC>rk Olympic Stadium]] hosted the [[2005 UEFA Champions League Final]].]]

The most popular sport in Turkey is [[Association football]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/sports.htm|title=Sports in Turkey|author=Burak Sansal|publisher=allaboutturkey.com|accessdate=2006-12-13|year=2006}}</ref> Turkey's top teams include [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]], [[Fenerbah<U+00E7>e S.K.|Fenerbah<U+00E7>e]], [[Trabzonspor]] and [[Be<U+015F>ikta<U+015F> J.K.|Be<U+015F>ikta<U+015F>]].

Other mainstream sports such as [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] are also popular. Turkey hosted the finals of [[EuroBasket 2001]] and the finals of the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]], winning second place on both occasions; while [[Efes Pilsen S.K.]] won the [[Kora<U+0107> Cup]] in 1996, finished second in the [[Saporta Cup]] of 1993, and made it to the Final Four of [[Euroleague]] and [[Suproleague]] in 2000 and 2001.<ref>[http://en.efesbasket.org/the_clup/icerik.aspx?SectionId=103 Historic achievements of the Efes Pilsen Basketball Team]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> Turkish basketball players such as [[Mehmet Okur]] and [[Hidayet T<U+00FC>rko<U+011F>lu|Hedo Turkoglu]] have also been successful in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].
