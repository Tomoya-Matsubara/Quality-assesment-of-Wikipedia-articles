'''Frederick Emmons Terman''' (June 7, 1900 in [[English, Indiana]] <U+2013> December 19, 1982) was an [[United States|American]] academic. He is widely credited (together with [[William Shockley]]) with being the father of [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>[http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanfordresearchpark.html Palo Alto History Project]</ref>

==Education==
Terman completed his undergraduate degree in [[chemistry]] and his master's degree in [[electrical engineering]] at [[Stanford University]]. His father [[Lewis Terman]], the man who popularized the [[IQ test]] in [[United States|America]], was a professor at Stanford. Terman went on to earn an [[ScD]] in electrical engineering from [[MIT]] in 1924. His advisor at MIT was [[Vannevar Bush]], who first proposed what became the [[National Science Foundation]].

==Academic career==
He returned to Stanford in 1925 as a member of the engineering faculty. From 1925 to 1941 Terman designed a course of study and research in electronics at Stanford that focused on work with vacuum tubes, circuits, and instrumentation. He also wrote ''Radio Engineering'' (first edition in 1932; second edition, much improved, in 1938; third edition in 1947 with added coverage of new technologies developed during World War II; fourth edition in 1955 with a new title, ''Electronic and Radio Engineering''), one of the most important books on electrical and radio engineering, and to this day a good reference on those subjects. Terman's students at Stanford included [[Oswald Garrison Villard, Jr.]], [[William Reddington Hewlett|William Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]]. He encouraged his students to form their own companies and personally invested in many of them, resulting in firms such as [[Litton Industries]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Terman was president of the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Frederick_Terman |title=Frederick Terman |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=09 August 2011}}</ref>

During World War II, Terman directed a staff of more than 850 at the [[Radio Research Laboratory]] at [[Harvard University]]. This organization was the source of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Radar jamming and deception|jammers]] to block enemy [[radar]], tunable receivers to detect radar signals, and aluminum strips (<U+201C>chaff<U+201D>) to produce spurious reflections on enemy radar receivers. These [[countermeasure]]s significantly reduced the effectiveness of radar-directed [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]].

After the war Terman returned to Stanford and was appointed [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the School of Engineering. In 1951 he spearheaded the creation of Stanford Industrial Park (now [[Stanford Research Park]]), whereby the University leased portions of its land to high-tech firms.<ref>[http://otl.stanford.edu/about/documents/JSstanfordpark.pdf Sandelin, John, ''The Story of the Stanford Industrial/Research Park'', 2004]</ref> Companies such as [[Varian Associates]], Hewlett-Packard, [[Eastman Kodak]], [[General Electric]], and [[Lockheed Corporation]] moved into Stanford Industrial Park and made the mid-Peninsula area into a hotbed of innovation which eventually became known as [[Silicon Valley]].

He served as [[provost (education)|Provost]] at Stanford from 1955 to 1965. During his tenure, Terman greatly expanded the science, statistics and engineering departments in order to win more research grants from the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. These grants, in addition to the funds that the patented research generated, helped to catapult Stanford into the ranks of the world's first class educational institutions, as well as spurring the growth of [[Silicon Valley]]. 

In 1964, Dr. Terman became a [[List of founding members of the National Academy of Engineering|founding member]] of the [[National Academy of Engineering]].

==Quote==
Looking back on his creation in his declining years, Frederick Terman reflected, "When we set  out  to  create  a  community  of  technical scholars  in  Silicon  Valley, there wasn't much here and the rest of the world looked awfully big.  Now a lot of the rest of the world is here."<ref>[http://www.paloaltohistory.com/stanfordresearchpark.html Palo Alto History Project]</ref>
When once asked whether he wanted his university [Stanford] to be a teaching institution or a research institution, he replied that "it should be a learning institution".

==Recognition==
* He was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor|IRE Medal of Honor]] in 1950 for "his many contributions to the radio and electronic industry as teacher, author, scientist and administrator". 
* The Frederick Emmons Terman Award was established in 1969 by the [[American Society for Engineering Education]], Electrical and Computer Engineering Division. It is sponsored by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and is bestowed annually upon an outstanding young electrical engineering educator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asee.org/member-resources/awards/full-list-of-awards/professional-and-technical-division-awards |title=Professional and Technical Division Awards |publisher=[[American Society for Engineering Education]] |accessdate={{Start date|2010|11|3}}}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asee.org/member-resources/awards/full-list-of-awards/awards-archive/past-division-award-winners-2#Electrical_and_Computer_Engineering_Division |title=Past Frederick Emmons Terman Award Winners |publisher=[[American Society for Engineering Education]] |accessdate={{Start date|2010|11|3}}}}</ref>
* The Frederick Emmons Terman Engineering Scholastic Award is presented to the students that rank academically in the top five percent of the graduating senior class from the [[Stanford University]] School of Engineering.<ref>[http://soe.stanford.edu/about/terman_scholastic_awards.html Stanford Scholastic Awards]</ref>
* Stanford's Frederick Emmons Terman Engineering Center is named in his honor.
* [[Terman Middle School]], in [[Palo Alto]], California is named after Terman and his father.
* In the [[KAIST]], the most famous Korean university of science, Terman Hall is named after Terman as he made the fundamental report called 'Terman Report', for the purpose of founding the university.
