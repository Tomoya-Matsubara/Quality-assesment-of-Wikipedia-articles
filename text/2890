==Career==
===Sweden===
Demir played youth football with [[Malm<U+00F6> FF]], making his professional debut in the [[Svenska Cupen]] against [[Kristianstads FF|Kristianstads]]. He scored the first goal in what would become a 3-2 win to Malm<U+00F6>.<ref>http://www.football-lineups.com/match/23654/</ref> A move to [[IF Limhamn Bunkeflo|LB07]] was next as it became apparent he would not break into the Malm<U+00F6> first team. At the start of 2011, Demir moved back into the [[Allsvenskan]] with [[Trelleborgs FF|Trelleborg]]. Despite finishing fifteenth and in a relegation spot, Demir was nominated for Allsvenskan Newcomer of the Year.<ref>http://svenskfotboll.se/svensk-fotboll/historia/fotbollsgalan/arets-nykomling/</ref> His impressive season attracted interest from Swedish side [[Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg<U+00E5>rden]] and unnamed teams in Turkey, the country of his origins.<ref>http://www.trelleborgsallehanda.se/sport/article1585941/Erdin-Demir-nara-Brann.html</ref>
