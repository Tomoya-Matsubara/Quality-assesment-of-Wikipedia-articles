'''Hippasus''' ({{lang-grc|<U+1F3D><U+03C0><U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ''H<U+00ED>ppasos''; 5th century BC) of [[Metapontum]] in [[Magna Graecia]], was a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[philosopher]]. Little is known about his life or his beliefs, but he is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of [[irrational numbers]].

==Life==
Little is known about the life of Hippasus. He may have lived in the late 5th century BC. He probably came from [[Metapontum]] in [[Italy]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), although the nearby city of [[Crotone|Croton]] is also mentioned as his birthplace.<ref>Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 18 (81)</ref> [[Iamblichus]] states that he was the founder of a sect of the Pythagoreans called the ''Mathematici'' ({{lang-el|<U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03B8><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03AF>}}) in opposition to the ''Acusmatici'' ({{lang-el|<U+1F00><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03AF>}});<ref>Iamblichus, ''De Communi Mathematica Scientia'', 76</ref> but elsewhere he makes him the founder of the ''Acusmatici'' in opposition to the ''Mathematici''.<ref>Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 18 (81); cf. Iamblichus, ''In Nic.'' 10.20; ''De anima'' ap. Stobaeus, i.49.32</ref>

==Doctrines==
[[Aristotle]]  speaks of Hippasus as holding the element of [[fire (classical element)|fire]] to be the cause of all things;<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaph.'' i. 3 cf. Simplicius, ''Commentary on the Physics'', 23.33-24.4</ref> and [[Sextus Empiricus]] contrasts him with the Pythagoreans in this respect, that he believed the ''[[arche]]'' to be material, whereas they thought it was incorporeal, namely, number.<ref>Sextus Empiricus, ''ad Phys.'' i. 361</ref> [[Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius]] tells us that Hippasus believed that "there is a definite time which the changes in the universe take to complete, and that the universe is limited and ever in motion."<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, viii. 84 cf. Simplicius, ''Commentary on the Physics'', 23.33-24.4</ref> According to one statement, Hippasus left no writings,<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, viii. 84</ref> according to another he was the author of the ''Mystic Discourse'', written to bring [[Pythagoras]] into disrepute.<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, viii. 7</ref>

A [[scholium]] on [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' notes him as an early experimenter in [[music theory]], claiming that he made use of [[bronze]] disks to discover the fundamental musical ratios, 4:3, 3:2, and 2:1.<ref>Scholium on Plato's ''Phaedo'', 108D</ref>

===Irrational numbers===
Hippasus is sometimes credited with the discovery of the existence of [[irrational numbers]], following which he was [[drown]]ed at sea. Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is confused.

[[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning.<ref>Pappus, ''Commentary on Book X of Euclid's Elements''. A similar story is quoted in a Greek [[scholium]] to the tenth book.</ref> [[Iamblichus]] gives a series of inconsistent reports. In one story he explains how a Pythagorean was merely expelled for divulging the nature of the irrational; but he then cites the legend of the Pythagorean who drowned at sea for making known the construction of the regular [[dodecahedron]] in the [[sphere]].<ref name="iamblichus246">Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 34 (246)</ref> In another account he tells how it was Hippasus who drowned at sea for betraying the construction of the dodecahedron and taking credit for this construction himself;<ref>Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 18 (88), ''De Communi Mathematica Scientia'', 25</ref> but in another story this same punishment is meted out to the Pythagorean who divulged knowledge of the irrational.<ref>Iamblichus, ''Vita Pythagorica'', 34 (247)</ref> Iamblichus clearly states that the drowning at sea was a punishment from the [[Greek gods|gods]] for impious behaviour.<ref name="iamblichus246"/>

These stories are usually taken together to ascribe the discovery of irrationals to Hippasus, but whether he did or not is uncertain.<ref>Wilbur Richard Knorr, (1975), ''The Evolution of the Euclidean Elements: A Study of the Theory of Incommensurable Magnitudes and its Significance for Early Greek Geometry'', pages 21-2, 50-1. Springer.</ref> In principle, the stories can be combined, since it is possible to discover irrational numbers when constructing dodecahedrons. Irrationality, by infinite reciprocal subtraction, can be easily seen in the [[Golden ratio]] of the regular [[pentagon]].<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], (1972), ''Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism'', page 459. Harvard University Press</ref>

Some modern scholars prefer to credit Hippasus with the discovery of the irrationality of [[Square root of 2|<U+221A>2]]. [[Plato]] in his ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'',<ref>Plato, ''Theaetetus'', 147D ff</ref> describes how [[Theodorus of Cyrene]] (c. 400 BC) proved the irrationality of <U+221A>3, <U+221A>5, etc. up to <U+221A>17, which implies that an earlier mathematician had already proved the irrationality of <U+221A>2.<ref>[[T. L. Heath|Thomas Heath]], (1921) ''A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid'', p. 155.</ref> A simple proof of the irrationality of <U+221A>2 is indicated by [[Aristotle]], and it is set out in the proposition interpolated at the end of [[Euclid]]'s Book X,<ref>Thomas Heath, (1921) ''A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid'', p. 157.</ref> which suggests that the proof was certainly ancient.<ref name="heath168">Thomas Heath, (1921) ''A History of Greek Mathematics, Volume 1, From Thales to Euclid'', p. 168.</ref> The proof is one of [[reductio ad absurdum]], and the method is to show that, if the diagonal of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] is [[commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] with the side, then the same number must be both odd and even.<ref name="heath168"/>

In the hands of modern writers this combination of vague ancient reports and modern guesswork has sometimes evolved into a much more emphatic and colourful tale. Some writers have Hippasus making his discovery while on board a ship, as a result of which his Pythagorean shipmates toss him overboard;<ref>[[Morris Kline]], (1990), ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', page 32. Oxford University Press</ref> while one writer even has [[Pythagoras]] himself "to his eternal shame" sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing "that <U+221A>2 is an irrational number."<ref>[[Simon Singh]], (1998), ''Fermat's Enigma'', page 50</ref>

===Proof of the irrationality of <U+221A>2===
The ''reductio ad absurdum'' proof of the irrationality of <U+221A>2 is as follows:<ref>David Berlinski (2005) ''Infinite Ascent'', pp. 9-10</ref>

# Take a right triangle whose sides are 1 unit in length
# By the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal is <U+221A>2
# Suppose that <U+221A>2 is a natural number, or that it is the ratio of two natural numbers. In both cases, it can be represented as the ratio of two natural numbers, <U+221A>2=m/n
# Suppose that m/n has been reduced to its lowest common form by division
# It follows that either m and n are both odd, or that m is odd and n is even, or that m is even and n is odd (if not, we could reduce m/n even further by dividing both numbers by 2)
# Square both sides of <U+221A>2=m/n, so that 2=m<sup>2</sup>/n<sup>2</sup>
# Then 2n<sup>2</sup>=m<sup>2</sup>, so that m<sup>2</sup> is even, and therefore m is even
# If m is even, then m=2x, where x is some other natural number
# Squaring this, it follows that m<sup>2</sup>=4x<sup>2</sup>=2n<sup>2</sup>
# It follows that n<sup>2</sup>=2x<sup>2</sup>, and therefore n<sup>2</sup> is even, which means that n, being a natural number, must be even
# So we've reached a contradiction: although we assumed that m and n cannot both be even, it now turns out they both are. It therefore follows that <U+221A>2 cannot be expressed as the ratio of two natural numbers, and must therefore be in another class of numbers
