'''Joanna Clare "Jo" Yeates''' (19 April 1985 <U+2013> 17 December 2010) was a 25-year old [[landscape architect]] from [[Hampshire]], England, who went [[missing person|missing]] on 17 December 2010 in [[Bristol]] after an evening out with colleagues. Following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries, her body was discovered on 25 December 2010 in [[Failand]], [[North Somerset]]. After a [[Autopsy|post-mortem examination]] it was determined that she had been [[strangling|strangled]].

The murder inquiry, named Operation Braid, was one of the largest ever police investigations in the Bristol area. The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates' family sought assistance from the public through [[social networking service]]s and press conferences. Rewards amounting to <U+00A3>60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates' death. The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord, who lived in a flat in the same building as she.

Vincent Tabak, a 32-year-old [[Dutch people|Dutch]] engineer and neighbour of Yeates, was arrested on 20 January 2011. Media attention at the time centred on the filming of a re-enactment of her disappearance for the [[BBC]]'s programme, ''[[Crimewatch]]''.  After two days of questioning, he was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates' murder. On 5 May 2011, Tabak pleaded guilty to Yeates' [[manslaughter]], but denied murdering her. His trial started on 4 October 2011; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011, and sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life imprisonment]] with a recommendation he serve at least 20 years.

The nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to the instigation of legal proceedings against a number of UK newspapers. [[Defamation|Libel]] action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest, resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages. The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' were found guilty of [[Contempt of court#England|contempt of court]] for reporting information that could prejudice a trial. A memorial service was held for Yeates at the parish church in the Bristol suburb where she lived; her funeral took place near the family home in Hampshire. Several memorials were planned, including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in Bristol.

At approximately 8:00&nbsp;pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon returned home from a weekend visit to [[Sheffield]] to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon had been trying to contact her by [[Telephone|phone]] and [[SMS|text]], but did not find it "completely out of character" that she did not respond.

===DNA tests===

DNA tests were carried out by [[LGC Forensics]], a private company which undertakes forensic analysis for criminal investigations. Lindsey Lennen, a body fluids and DNA specialist member of the team that analysed DNA samples from Yeates' body said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak, they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated. The team deployed a method known as DNA SenCE, which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration: "We couldn't say whether the DNA was from saliva, or semen, or even touch. But we could say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion."<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jan/17/csi-oxford-lgc-forensics|title= CSI Oxford: behind the scenes at Britain's top forensic lab|publisher= Guardian Media Group|newspaper= The Guardian|first= Jon|last= Henley|date= 17 January 2012|accessdate= 10 February 2012}}</ref>

===Murder charge and plea===
After questioning during 96 hours of detention, Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with the murder of Joanna Yeates. He made a brief appearance at Bristol [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]] on 24 January and was remanded in custody.<ref name="BBC-20110124">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-12262194|title=Jo Yeates murder accused Vincent Tabak in court|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=24 January 2011|accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> Tabak, legally represented by Paul Cook, declined to request bail during a hearing the following day.

Tabak initially maintained he was not responsible for Joanna Yeates' death, claiming that DNA evidence linking him to the crime had been fabricated by corrupt officials.

===Vincent Tabak===
Vincent Tabak (born 10 February 1978) was a Dutch engineer<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/24/vincent-tabak-court-joanna-yeates-murder-charge|title= Vincent Tabak in court on Joanna Yeates murder charge|first= Steven|last= Morris|publisher= Guardian Media Group|work= The Guardian|date= 24 January 2011|accessdate= 24 December 2011}}</ref> who had lived and worked in the United Kingdom since 2007.<ref name=Guardian28102011>{{cite news|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/28/vincent-tabak-porn-searches-jury|title= Vincent Tabak and the porn searches the jury did not hear about|publisher= Guardian Media Group|work= The Guardian|first= Steven|last= Morris|date= 28 October 2011|accessdate= 3 December 2011}}</ref> The son of Gerald and Sonja Tabak,<ref name="DailyMail-20110122-split"/> and the youngest of five siblings,<ref name=Guardian28102011/> he was raised in [[Uden]], 21 miles (34&nbsp;km) north of [[Eindhoven]].<ref name=BBC28102011>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-15259135|title= Vincent Tabak: Neighbour remembers 'introverted' child|publisher= BBC|work= BBC News|date= 28 October 2011|accessdate= 3 December 2011}}</ref> Tabak's childhood next-door neighbour, John Massoeurs, described him after the trial as an intelligent "introverted" loner. Tabak studied at [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] from 1996, graduating with an [[Master of Science|MSc]] in architecture, building and planning in 2003, then began a [[PhD]] in which his thesis was a study of how people use space in office buildings and public areas. The paper was published in 2008.<ref name=Guardian28102011/><ref name=BBC28102011/>

Leaving university in 2007, he moved to the United Kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of Buro Happold, an engineering consultancy firm in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and settled in a flat in the town. He worked as a "people flow analyst", a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools, airports and sports stadiums. While living in Bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian's]]'' online dating website ''Soulmates''. She was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis: "I am very happy she entered my life." The couple moved to a flat in Canynge Road, Bristol, in June 2009.<ref name=Guardian28102011/> Though Joanna Yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in Canynge Road in the autumn of 2010, she and Tabak did not meet prior to 17 December.<ref name=BBC28102011/>

In the months leading up to Yeates' death, Tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States, and contacted several prostitutes by phone.<ref>{{cite news|last=Evans |first=Martin |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8847825/Vincent-Tabak-regularly-contacted-prostitutes.html |title=Vincent Tabak 'regularly contacted prostitutes' |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=11 March 2012}}</ref>  He also viewed violent [[internet pornography]] that depicted women being controlled by men, showing images of them being bound and gagged, held by the neck and choked. During the murder investigation, police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates. In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts. When Yeates was discovered, she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top.<ref name=Guardian28102011/> At Tabak's trial, prosecuting barrister Nigel Lickley QC, argued that the evidence of Tabak's activities should be provided to the jury: "It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life."<ref name=Guardian28102011/> Details of Tabak's viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution's case since the judge believed it did not prove that Tabak had acted with [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kelly |first=Chris |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-14904647 |title=Vincent Tabak 'viewed violent web porn' |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref> After the trial it was disclosed that images of [[child pornography]] had been found on Tabak's laptop.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morris |first=Steven|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/nov/01/child-porn-found-vincent-tabak |title=Images of child sexual abuse found on Vincent Tabak's laptop |work=The Guardian|publisher= Guardian Media Group |date=1 November 2011 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref>

Evidence was presented that Tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body.<ref name="Guardian-2011-10-11"/> The court heard that [[DNA]] swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak.<ref name=bbc11Oct2011/> Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car.

In his defence, Tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated,<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated1 /> and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed when he tried to kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a "flirty comment" and invited him to drink with her.

==Media controversy==
The nature in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the British media led to one television broadcaster being temporarily banned from attending press conferences,<ref name="Journalism-20110107-reward"/> and the instigation of legal proceedings against several newspapers by both Yeates' former landlord,<ref name=Guardian-2011-04-21/> and the Attorney General.<ref name=BBC-2011-05-12/>

Following a television news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised the handling of the investigation, [[ITN]] reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case.<ref name="Guardian-20110105-banned">{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/05/itv-news-joanna-yeates-investigation|title=ITV News banned from Joanna Yeates press conference|newspaper=The Guardian|publisher= Guardian Media Group|date=5 January 2011|accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref> The item, presented by journalist [[Geraint Vincent]] claimed police had made little progress with their investigation, and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods.
