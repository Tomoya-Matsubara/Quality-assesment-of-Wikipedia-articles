[[Image:Halo 3 Nasdaq.jpg|thumb|right|''Halo 3''{{'}}s release was celebrated by more than 10,000 launch parties around the world, like this one at the [[NASDAQ]] building in [[New York City]].]]
The [[first person shooter]] video game ''[[Halo 3]]'' was the focus of an extensive marketing campaign which began with the game's developer, [[Bungie]], announcing the game via a trailer at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in May 2005. [[Microsoft]], the game's publisher, planned a five-pronged marketing strategy to maximize sales and to appeal to casual and hard-core gamers. Bungie produced trailers and video documentaries to promote the game, partnering with firms such as [[Digital Domain]] and [[Weta Workshop]]. Licensed products including action figures, toys, and ''Halo 3''-branded soda were released in anticipation of the game; the franchise utilized more than forty licensees to promote the game, and the advertising campaign ultimately cost more than $40 million.

While ''Halo 2''{{'}}s release had set industry records, the mainstream press was not fully involved in covering the game; part of Microsoft's strategy was to fully involve casual readers and the press in the story. The saturation of advertising and promotions led ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' to state: "The release of ''Halo 3'' this week was an event that stretched far beyond our little gaming world. Everyone from the ''[[New York Times]]'' to ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' wanted to cover it."<ref name="wired mainstream">{{cite web|author=Kohler, Christ|date=2007-08-27|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/09/halo-3-the-main.html|title=Halo 3: The Mainstream Press Responds|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>

Released on September 25, 2007, ''Halo 3'' became the biggest entertainment debut in history, earning more than $170 million in a few days and selling a record 3,300,000 copies in its first week of sales alone.<ref name="1up-3.3mil">{{cite web|author=Klepeck, Patrick|date=2007-10-18|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3163779|title= September NPD: Halo 3 Sells 3.3M|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> ''Halo 3''{{'}}s marketing won several awards, and was cited as evidence of the increasing mainstream popularity of games.

==Development==
Jerret West, a global group product manager from Microsoft, said at a marketing conference that ''[[Halo 3]]''{{'}}s marketing team had a mandate from Microsoft executive [[Peter Moore]]: "Don't screw up."<ref name="gamedaily-transcend">{{cite web|author=Zelfdan, Evan|date=2008-04-10|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/mi6-halo-3-transcended-pop-culture/|title=MI6: Halo 3 'Transcended Pop Culture'|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=2008-10-17}}</ref> Much of the marketing organization was handled by Microsoft's former corporate vice president of global marketing, Jeff Bell.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bulik, Beth Snyder|date=2007-11-12|title='Halo 3', Jeff Bell|work=[[Advertising Age]]|page=S6}}</ref> A key challenge the team identified early on was that core gamers knew the game was coming out, but there was "a perception problem... we wanted to invite people into the console and into Xbox 360 and to play ''Halo 3'' as a mass-market entertainment product," according to product manager Chris Lee.<ref name="gamasutra-analysis">{{cite web|author=Nutt, Christian|date=2008-04-11|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18213|title=Analysis: Microsoft On The Secrets Of Marketing Halo 3|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref> Since ''Halo 3'' was released as an Xbox 360 exclusive, part of the marketing push was to sell more Xbox consoles, which had encountered sluggish sales.<ref>{{cite news|author=Todd, Tyler|date=2007-08-18|title=Warning; do not read while consuming Game Fuel|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]|page=I4}}</ref>

Microsoft planned advertising and promotions to appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers in a five-pronged marketing strategy.<ref name="brandweek-onslaught">{{cite web|author=Hein, Kenneth|date=2007-09-07|url=http://www.brandweek.com/bw/magazine/current/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003637129|title=Strategy: Anatomy Of An Onslaught: How Halo 3 Attacked|work=[[Brandweek]]|accessdate=2008-09-01}}</ref> The first stage was to kick off marketing via a television commercial. The second stage was a beta test of the game to drive preorders and press attention. The third stage was the start of an [[alternate reality game]]. The fourth phase was partner promotions, capped off with a final advertising campaign, titled "Believe".<ref name="brandweek-onslaught"/>

Though Microsoft used forms of [[viral marketing]] for promotion (including the alternate reality game or ARG),<ref>{{cite news|author=Ling, Toh|date=2007-10-08|title=Net Value: Creating the Halo effect |work=[[The Edge (Malaysia)|The Edge]]|page=1}}</ref> the main focus of the company's efforts was traditional media outlets.  Because there already was interest in the title among the gaming community, Microsoft did not feel the need to run a social media campaign, instead banking on the gaming community to spread the word itself. The focus on traditional media would help expand the fan base beyond established gamers and convince the public that the game was a cultural milestone. To build public interest, Microsoft made public statements that ''Halo 3'' would surpass media sales records, including the July 2007 record of $166 million set by the launch of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Bush, Michael|date=2007-10-01|title='Halo 3' push focuses on traditional media outlets|work=PR Week|page=1}}</ref>

==Promotional videos==
A significant form of marketing was done by the release of videos. While Bungie often partnered with other companies to create advertisements, they also produced their own video documentaries, or "ViDocs", detailing the behind-the-scenes development of aspects of ''Halo 3'', including redesigning enemy [[Covenant (Halo)#Brutes|Brutes]], additions to multiplayer, and other game features.<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff|date=2007-04-10|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/108531/bungie-devs-outline-new-multiplayer-features-in-halo-3-trailer/|title=Bungie devs outline new multiplayer features in Halo 3 trailer|work=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref> The first ViDoc was released shortly after the game's announcement and was a "[[making-of]]" style video, while the final ViDoc made its debut on September 20, 2007.
===Trailers and shorts===
''Halo 3'' was officially announced via a cinematic trailer rendered in real-time, shown at [[Microsoft]]'s press conference at [[E3 Media and Business Summit|E3]] 2006 on May 9.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ocampo, Jason|date=2006-05-09|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/halo3/news.html?sid=6149725|title=E3 06: Halo 3 announced, plot details revealed|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref> The trailer is set in the dry plains of Africa, with the ruins of a [[space elevator]] and other damage visible. The [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] is slowly revealed walking through smoke and dust, occasionally obscured by distorted images of the artificial intelligence [[Cortana]] transmitting a message composed of portions of the character's lines in the [[Cortana Letters]], as well as a line from the poem "[[The Hollow Men]]".<ref name="trailerfaq">{{cite web |author=O'Connor, Frank|date=2006-05-12|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=weeklyupdatemay1206 |title=Bungie Weekly Update: May 12, 2006| publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|accessdate=2006-05-12}}</ref> The distorted voice of Cortana was a deliberate clue to the character's predicament in ''[[Halo 3]]'', with a Bungie staff member stating, "We don't know what has happened to her...We don't know it's Cortana.

Advertising company [[McCann-Erickson]] created a second trailer that was aired only once on December 4, 2006.<ref name="wireless-2nd trailer">{{cite press release |title=Bungie Studios Readies 'Halo 3' - ESPN to Carry Ad 'Preview' Spot on December 4 |url= |publisher=Wireless News |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=}}</ref> The video used a mix of computer-created graphics and live action;<ref name="hbo-irc">{{cite web |author=O'Connor, Frank; HBO|url=http://carnage.bungie.org/haloforum/halo.forum.pl?read=765343 |date=2006-12-05|title=Frankie's Q&A from #HBO IRC |accessdate=2006-12-05|publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org|Bungie.org]]}}</ref> computer graphics were produced by [[Digital Domain]] and directed by Joseph Kosinski.<ref name=cgw>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgw.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=news&mod=News&mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&tier=3&nid=A047A473A6B844D981874C31C5DFDCD4|title=Digital Domain Joins Forces with Microsoft to Announce Upcoming Halo Sequel|publisher=Computer Graphics World|accessdate=2008-04-13|author=Staff|date=2006-12-21}}</ref> The spot, dubbed "Starry Night", was seen by 7.9 million viewers in its broadcast and watched more than 3.5 million times on YouTube by September 2007.<ref name="globe-play's the thing">{{cite news|author=Hartley, Matt|date=2007-09-22|title=The Play's The Thing|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=B3}}</ref> The final trailer, shown during [[E3 2007]] on July 11, consisted of actual campaign cinematics and gameplay.

The video teasers for ''Halo 3'' included a series of videos directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]], the proposed director of a possible ''[[Halo (film)|Halo]]'' film produced by [[Peter Jackson]]. Unlike previous trailers and videos, the shorts were the first to depict the ''Halo'' universe in a live-action setting. The production was a collaboration between [[Weta Workshop]], [[Neill Blomkamp]] and [[Bungie Studios]]. When asked about the shorts, Neill said that he hoped that it would help to interest movie studios in his currently [[Halo (series)#Film adaptation|inactive movie project]], since it lost its studio support in October 2006. [[GameTrailers]] released a compilation of the three videos edited together, titling it ''Landfall''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/player/27234.html|title=Landfall|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date=2007-10-30|accessdate=2007|10-30}}</ref>

The first live action video, titled ''Arms Race'', was originally shown at [[E3 2007|Electronic Entertainment Expo 2007]]. It was followed up by another short, ''Combat'', which featured Covenant and human vehicles and weapons. The final video in the series aired on [[October 4]], [[2007]] and was used by [[Discovery Channel]] to promote their [[reality show]] ''[[Last Man Standing (UK TV series)|Last One Standing]]''.<ref>{{web cite|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/last-one-standing/halo-sweeps/halo-sweeps.html|title=Halo Exclusive Video and Sweepstakes|publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]|date=2007-09-25|accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref> The short ties the events depicted to the beginning of ''Halo 3'', which begins as the Master Chief plummets to Earth.

==="Believe" campaign===
[[Image:Halo3-believe-shot.png|thumb|right|The marines featured in the "Believe" ads were based on the facial expressions of real people.]]
The last major advertising campaign before and during ''Halo 3''{{'}}s release was a series of videos marketed with the tagline "Believe", beginning September 11, 2007. These videos, with an estimated cost of $10 million,<ref name="brandweek-onslaught"/> were directed by Rupert Sanders (known for video game advertisements) and made to depict a generic representation of a single battle in ''Halo 3''. Live-action videos featured elderly war veterans at the "Museum of Humanity" reminiscing about the Human-Covenant war and the role the Master Chief played. A [http://halo3.com/believe "Believe" web site] allowed visitors to pan the length of a massive [[diorama]] over {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} in size and over twelve feet tall, with handcrafted human and Covenant figures represented at one-twelfth scale.<ref name="creativity-diorama">{{cite news|author=Aditham, Kiran|date=2007-10-01|title=The Diorama Deconstructed; Modeling mayhem|work=[[Creativity (magazine)|Creativity]]|page=46}}</ref> According to Microsoft, the unusual presentation of a model rather than computer graphics was chosen to look at "the themes that lie at the heart of the ''Halo'' trilogy&mdash;war, duty, sacrifice, and most importantly the heroism of Master Chief."<ref>{{cite web|author=Elliot, Phil|date=2007-09-12|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/halo-3-uk-tv-ad-detailed|title='Halo 3' UK ad detailed|publisher=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry.biz]]|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref>

The diorama was built through a collaboration between Lost Angeles, California-based [[New Deal Studios]] and [[Stan Winston Studios]]. Director Rupert Sanders had actors stand in for the marines, capturing their facial expressions and using them as the basis of the miniatures. Character assets from Bungie, including alien models and armor, were  recreated and rebuilt for reuse.<ref name="creativity-diorama"/> The twisted city ruins the diorama is set in were inspired by bombed-out [[Afghanistan]] suburbs. Special attention was paid to creating a photo-realistic setting which was recognizably ''Halo''.<ref name="creativity-diorama"/>

==Public beta testing==
On April 10, 2007, Bungie announced that a beta test of the multiplayer component of ''Halo 3'' would run from May 16 to June 6, open to select members of the public. Players could enter the beta in several ways. Testers were selected from those who signed up on the Halo3.com website following the "Starry Night" commercial, or from the first 13,333 players to register after playing three hours of ''[[Halo 2]]'' on [[Xbox Live]]. Players could also buy a specially-marked copy of the Xbox 360 title ''[[Crackdown]]'', which allowed players to download the beta upon its release.<ref>{{cite web |author=Klepek, Francis|date=2007-02-07|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3157101|title=Crackdown disc required to play Halo 3 Beta |publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=2007-02-08}}</ref>

The public portion of the beta consists of matchmaking play on three multiplayer maps: Valhalla, High Ground and Snowbound.<ref>{{cite web |author=Staff|date=2007-02-16|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&link=h3betaz |title=Halo 3 Beta FAQ |publisher=[[Bungie.net]]|accessdate=2007-02-06}}</ref> The public beta also contained a limited version of the "saved films" feature, which allows players to save and watch their played games. The day the public beta began, problems were reported from owners of ''Crackdown'' that they could not download the beta. Bungie announced that the Microsoft team found a solution and that the issue would be resolved shortly;<ref name=crackdownfix>{{cite web |author=Jarrard, Brian|date=2007-05-16|url=http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=news&cid=12468 |title=Halo 3 Beta Downloads via Crackdown are fixed! |accessdate=2007-05-16|publisher=[[Bungie.net]]}}</ref> a patch was distributed for ''Crackdown'' that fixed the problem. Bungie also extended the beta until June 10 to compensate for the issue.<ref name=crackdownfix /> According to Jerret West, global group product manager, allowing users into the beta created "a psychological investment" in the game. "The idea was basically to make the beta launch huge and let the tastemakers make the launch for you... to really drive it beyond the gaming press." The beta caused a spike in preorders for the retail version of the game.<ref name="gamasutra-analysis"/>

==Alternate reality game==
A component of ''Halo 3''{{'}}s marketing was an [[alternate reality game]] or ARG called "Iris". Alternate reality games, which involve cross-media gameplay and player participation, had been previously used for the promotion of ''Halo 2'' in the form of the influential and award-winning ''[[I Love Bees]]''. Soon after the ''Halo 3'' public beta ended, a user named "AdjutantReflex" appeared in the official ''Halo 3'' forums on [[Bungie.net]] and began posting.<ref name="teamxbox-iris">{{cite web|author=Berardini, C<U+00E9>sarz|date=2007-01-15|url=http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/13719/Halo-3-ARG-in-Full-Swing-Official-Web-Site-Updated/|title=Halo 3 ARG in Full Swing, Official Web Site Updated|publisher=[[TeamXbox]]|accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> A Circuit City advertisement was leaked onto the web days earlier, revealing the web address of an interactive comic which could be manipulated to reveal the [[IP address]]es of another series of sites.

==Merchandise and promotions==
[[Image:WarthogActionClix.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Warthog (Halo)|Warthog]] from the ActionClix game]]
The launch of ''Halo 3'' coincided with the release of various games, action figures, and collectible toys. [[Wizkids]] developed a [[collectible miniatures game]] entitled ''Halo ActionClix'' which was released on September 18, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wizkidsgames.com/ |title=WizKids Game Calendar (Bottom of Page)|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref> The tabletop game features miniature figures from the ''Halo'' universe, including characters and vehicles. ''Halo ActionClix'' figures were occasionally bundled with the game in promotional packs, and [[Gamestation]] stores in the United Kingdom offered a Master Chief figurine to the first 1000 pre-orders of the ''Halo 3'' [[Halo 3#Versions|Legendary Edition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfarlanes-figures.com/halo-3.html|title=Halo 3 Becomes The World's Biggest Selling Game|publisher=McFarlanes Figures|date=2007-09-25|accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>

While previous ''Halo'' action figure series were produced by Joyride Studios, [[Todd McFarlane]] produced several sets of ''Halo 3''-related action figures. In addition to articulated figures released throughout 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox360fanboy.com/2007/10/30/mcfarlane-planning-lots-of-halo-figures-in-2008/|title= McFarlane planning lots of Halo figures in 2008|accessdate=2007-10-30}}</ref> McFarlane also released 12" inarticulate and more detailed figurines in November.<ref>{{cite web|author=Plunkett, Luke|date=2008-04-30|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/games/2008/04/30/newer_better_halo_3_toys-2.html|title=Newer, Better Halo 3 Toys|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=2008-10-18}}</ref> Other companies which produced ''Halo 3'' figures and statues include Kotobukiya, a Japanese company specializing in high-end statues and replicas, and Weta Collectibles, a division spawned from the famed physical effects company [[Weta Workshop]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|date=|url=http://www.wetanz.com/collectibles/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=13|title=Weta Collectibles, Exclusive Polystone Collectibles|publisher=[[Weta Workshop]]|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref> Weta Collectibles auctioned four of the statues in their lineup, specially cast in solid sterling silver, for auction on [[eBay]] during August.<ref>{{cite web|author=|date=|url=http://www.wetanz.com/holics/index.php?itemid=753&catid=21#more|title=Halo 3 collectibles: Only One in the Universes|publisher=[[Weta Workshop]]|accessdate=2008-11-02}} </ref>
