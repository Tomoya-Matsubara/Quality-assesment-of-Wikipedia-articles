The city has seen relatively steady growth since the beginning. The population doubled between the time of Oklahoma statehood and the 1910 census and even increased during the [[Great Depression]].<ref name="surv"/> An irrigation project in the 1940s and World War II led to further growth in the town as the nearby air field was used to train military pilots.<ref name="surv"/>

Altus was an important city on the defunct [[Wichita Falls and Northwestern Railway]], one of the [[Frank Kell]] and [[Joseph A. Kemp]] properties, which stretched from [[Wichita Falls, Texas|Wichita Falls]], [[Texas]], to [[Forgan, Oklahoma|Forgan]] in [[Beaver County, Oklahoma|Beaver County]] in far northwestern Oklahoma. It was later purchased by the [[Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad]] and since 1991 is operated by the [[Wichita, Tillman and Jackson Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqw10|title=Donovan L.
