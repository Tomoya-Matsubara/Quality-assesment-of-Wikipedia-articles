'''Mercury''', also called '''quicksilver''', is a [[chemical element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the symbol '''Hg''' (from the Latinized Greek '''''hydrargyrum''''', for ''watery'' [or ''liquid''] ''silver'') and [[atomic number]] 80. A heavy, silvery [[transition metal]], mercury is one of five elements that are [[liquid]] at or near standard room temperature (the others are the metals [[caesium]], [[francium]], and [[gallium]], and the [[nonmetal]] [[bromine]]). Mercury is used in [[Dental fillings|dental amalgam]] as well as [[thermometer]]s, [[barometer]]s and other scientific apparatus, although the use of mercury in thermometers has been largely phased out in clinical and scientific environments (in favor of [[alcohol]]-filled, digital or [[thermistor]]-based replacements) due to concerns about the element's toxicity. Mercury is mostly obtained by reduction from the [[mineral]] [[cinnabar]]. 

==Applications==
Mercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some [[thermometer]]s, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures (In the United States, non-prescription sale of mercury fever thermometers was banned by a number of different states and localities). Other uses:
*Mercury [[sphygmomanometer]]s.
*Mercury [[barometer]]s, [[diffusion pump]]s, [[Mercury coulometer|coulometers]], and many other laboratory instruments.  As an opaque liquid with a very high density, it is ideal for this role. 
*The [[triple point]] of mercury, -38.8344 <U+00B0>C, is a fixed point used as a temperature standard for the International Temperature Scale ([[ITS-90]]).
*In some gaseous [[Gas filled tube|electron tubes]], [[mercury arc rectifier]]
*Gaseous mercury is used in [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s and some "[[neon sign]]" type advertising signs and [[fluorescent lamps]].
*Liquid mercury was sometimes used as a [[coolant]] for [[nuclear reactor]]s. However [[sodium]] is proposed for reactors cooled with liquid metal, because the high density of mercury requires much energy for circulating the coolant.
*Mercury was once used in the [[amalgamation]] process of refining [[gold]] and [[silver]] [[ore]]s. This polluting practice is still used by the ''garimpeiros'' (gold miners) of the [[Amazon basin]] in [[Brazil]].
*Mercury is still used in some cultures for [[folk medicine]] and ceremonial purposes which may involve [[ingestion]], [[injection]], or the sprinkling of elemental mercury around the home.  It must be emphasized that the former two procedures, especially, are extremely hazardous.
*[[Alexander Calder]] built a [[mercury fountain]] for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 [[World's Fair]] in Paris.
*Used in [[electrochemistry]] as part of a secondary reference [[electrode]] called the [[Mercury(I) chloride|calomel electrode]] as an alternative to the [[Standard hydrogen electrode|Standard Hydrogen Electrode]]. This is used to work out the [[electrode potential]] of [[half cell]]s.

'''Miscellaneous uses:''' [[mercury switch]]es, [[electrode]]s in some types of [[electrolysis]], [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] ([[mercury battery|mercury cells]], including for [[sodium hydroxide]] and [[chlorine]] production, and [[alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]]), [[catalyst]]s, [[insecticide]]s, [[dental amalgam]]s/preparations and [[liquid mirror]] telescopes.
*[[Thiomersal]], (called ''Thimerosal'' in the United States), an [[organic compound]] used as a [[preservative]] in [[vaccine]]s (this use is disappearing<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.html FDA]</ref> and [[Thiomersal controversy]]).

'''Historical uses:''' preserving wood, developing [[daguerreotype]]s, [[silvering]] [[mirror]]s, anti-fouling paints (discontinued in 1990), [[herbicide]]s (discontinued in 1995), cleaning, and in-road leveling devices in cars. Mercury compounds have been used in [[antiseptic]]s, [[laxative]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, and [[Syphilis|antisyphilitics]].  It was also allegedly used by [[Western Allies|allied spies]] to sabotage [[Nazi Germany|German]] planes. A mercury paste was applied to bare [[aluminium]], causing the metal to rapidly [[Corrosion|corrode]].  This would cause mysterious structural failures.

In [[Islamic Spain]] it was used for filling decorative pools and for fountains.<ref>[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/197605/the.city.of.al-zahra.htm Saudiaramcoworld]</ref><ref>[http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/draper05.htm positiveatheism]</ref>

In some applications, mercury can be replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive [[galinstan]] [[alloy]].

A new type of [[atomic clock]], using mercury instead of [[caesium]], has been demonstrated. Accuracy is expected to be within one second in
100 million years.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1435488.stm BBC]</ref><ref>[http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/update/upd010723.htm#Time NIST]</ref>

==History==
[[Image:HG-alchemical.PNG|left]]
Mercury was known to the ancient [[China|Chinese]] and [[Hindu]]s  and was found in [[Egypt]]ian tombs that date from 1500 BC.{{fact}} In [[China]], [[India]] and [[Tibet]], mercury use was thought to prolong life, heal fractures, and maintain generally good health. China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang Di, is said to have been buried in a tomb that contained rivers of flowing mercury, representative of the rivers of China.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]]s used mercury in ointments and  the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] used it in [[cosmetics]]. By 500 BC mercury was used to make [[amalgams]] with other metals. 
The Indian word for [[alchemy]] is ''[[Rasav<U+0101>tam]]'' which means <U+2018>the way of mercury.<U+2019> Alchemists often thought of mercury as the first [[matter]] from which all metals were formed. Different [[metals]] could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of [[sulfur]] contained within the mercury. An ability to transform mercury into any metal resulted from the essentially mercurial quality of all metals. The purest of these was [[gold]], and mercury was required for the [[transmutation]] of base (or impure) metals into gold. This was a primary goal of alchemy, either for material or spiritual gain.

Hg is the modern [[chemical symbol]] for mercury. It comes from ''hydrargyrum'', a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''`<U+03A5><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03B3><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>'' (''hydrargyros''), which is a compound word meaning 'water' and 'silver' &mdash; since it is liquid, like water, and yet has a silvery metallic sheen. The element was named after the Roman god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], known for speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. The astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal (above left). Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.

From the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, a process called "carroting" was used in the making of [[felt hats]]. Animal skins were rinsed in an orange solution of the mercury compound [[mercuric nitrate]], Hg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><U+00B7>2H<sub>2</sub>O. This process separated the fur from the pelt and matted it together. This solution and the vapors it produced were highly toxic. Its use resulted in widespread cases of [[mercury poisoning]] among hatters. Symptoms included [[tremor]]s, [[emotional lability]], [[insomnia]], [[dementia]] and [[hallucination]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] banned the use of mercury in the felt industry in December 1941. The psychological symptoms associated with mercury poisoning may have inspired the phrase "mad as a hatter"; see the [[hatter]] article on the origin of the phrase.

===Dentistry===
Elemental mercury is the main ingredient in [[amalgam|dental amalgams]]. Controversy over the [[health effects]] from the use of mercury amalgams began shortly after its introduction into the western world, nearly 200 years ago. In 1843, The American Society of Dental Surgeons, concerned about mercury poisoning, required its members to sign a pledge that they would not use amalgam. In 1859, The [[American Dental Association]] was formed by dentists who believed amalgam was "safe and effective." The ADA, "continues to believe that amalgam is a valuable, viable and safe choice for dental patients," as written in their statement on dental amalgam.<ref>[http://www.ada.org/prof/resources/positions/statements/amalgam.asp statement on dental amalgam]</ref> In 1993, the [[United States Public Health Service]] reported that, "amalgam fillings release small amounts of mercury vapor," but in such a small amount that it, "has not been shown to cause any <U+2026> adverse health effects." This position is not shared by all governments and there is an ongoing [[dental amalgam controversy]].

===Medicine===
Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine for centuries, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely known and understood.

[[Mercury(I) chloride]] (also known as [[calomel]] or mercurous chloride) has traditionally been used as a [[diuretic]], topical [[disinfectant]], and [[laxative]]. [[Mercury(II) chloride]] (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat [[syphilis]] (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat (Pimple 2004); it was also used as a disinfectant. [[Blue mass]], a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the [[1800s]] for numerous conditions including, constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/07/0717_lincoln.html National Geographic]</ref> In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. 

Some [[vaccine]]s have contained the preservative [[Thimerosal]] (partly [[ethyl mercury]]) since the [[1930s]] FDA report.<ref>[http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccine/thimerosal.htm FDA report]</ref> It has been widely speculated that this mercury-based preservative can trigger [[autism]] in children who are already genetically predisposed to it;<ref name="autism090204">{{Cite web|url=http://www.autisticsociety.org/autism-article341.html|title=Mercury: Scientists suggest mercury-autism link, recommend action|accessdate=2006-05-07|publisher=Times Record News|year=2004|author=Lowy, Joan}}</ref> however, medical evidence in recent studies has revealed that there is no link.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/87/99457.htm|title=Experts Reject Vaccine-Autism Link|acccessdate=2006-08-18|publisher=WebMD Medical News|year=2004|author=Zwillich, Todd}}</ref>


Mercury in the form of one of its common ores, [[cinnabar]], remains an important component of [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|Chinese]], [[Tibetan medicine|Tibetan]], and [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] medicine.  As problems may arise when these medicines are exported to countries that prohibit the use of mercury in medicines, in recent times, less toxic substitutes have been devised.

Today, the use of mercury in medicine has greatly declined in all respects, especially in developed countries. [[Mercury-in-glass thermometer|Thermometer]]s and [[sphygmomanometer]]s containing mercury were invented in the early 18th and late 19th centuries, respectively. In the early 21st century, their use is declining and has been banned in some countries, states and medical institutions. In [[2002]], the [[U.S. Senate]] passed legislation to phase out the sale of [[Medical prescription|non-prescription]] mercury thermometers. In [[2003]], [[Washington]] and [[Maine]] became the first states to ban mercury blood pressure devices.<ref>[http://www.noharm.org/details.cfm?type=document&ID=782 HCWH News release]</ref> Mercury compounds are found in some [[over-the-counter drug]]s, including topical [[antiseptics]], stimulant [[laxative]]s, [[diaper rash|diaper-rash]] [[ointment]], [[eye drops]], and [[nasal spray]]s. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] (FDA) has <U+201C>inadequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness,<U+201D> of the mercury ingredients in these products.<ref>[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=310.545&SearchTerm=mercury Code of federal regulations]</ref> Mercury is still used in some diuretics, although substitutes now exist for most therapeutic uses.

In the [[European Union]], [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]] legislation being introduced will ban mercury from certain products, and limit the amount of mercury in other products to less than 1000 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (except for certain exemptions).

==Mineral occurrence==
[[Image:MercuryOreUSGOV.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury ore]]
Mercury is an extremely rare element in the earth's crust, having an average crustal abundance by mass of only 0.08 parts per million. However, because it does not blend [[geochemistry|geochemically]] with those elements that comprise the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be extraordinarily concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). This makes mercury ore the most easily depleted of all metal ores. Depletion of mercury ores has been a major concern since the 1960s and it is now almost certain that the last mineable deposits were discovered in [[Algeria]] in the mid-1970s. Since the early 1970s, total world production of mercury has fallen from 9,000 [[tonne]]s to 1,600 tonnes due to depletion of reserves.

It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in [[cinnabar]], [[corderoite]], [[livingstonite]], and other [[mineral]]s with cinnabar (Hg[[sulfur|S]]) being the most common ore. Mercury ores usually occur in very young orogenic belts where rock of high density are forced to the crust of the Earth, often in hot springs or other [[volcano|volcanic]] regions. Most present-day production occurs in [[Spain]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[China]] and [[Tajikistan]]. Over 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of [[Huancavelica]], [[Peru]], over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563; mercury from Huancavelica was crucial in the production of silver in colonial Spanish America. Many former ores in [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] which once produced a large proportion of the world's supply have now been completely mined out. The metal is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor. The equation for this extraction is
:HgS + O<sub>2</sub> <U+2192> Hg + SO<sub>2</sub>

==Compounds==
The most important salts are:
*[[Mercury(I) chloride]] (AKA [[calomel]]) is sometimes still used in [[medicine]] and acousto-optical filters
*[[Mercury(II) chloride]] (which is very [[corrosion|corrosive]], [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]]s and is a violent poison)
*[[Mercury fulminate]], (a [[detonator]] widely used in [[explosive]]s),
*[[Mercury(II) oxide]], the main [[oxide]] of mercury 
*[[Mercury(II) sulfide]] (AKA [[cinnabar]] mercuric ore still used in oriental medicine, or [[vermilion]] which is a high-grade [[paint pigment]]),
*[[Mercury(II) selenide]] a [[semiconductor]],
*[[Mercury(II) telluride]] a [[semiconductor]], and
*[[Mercury cadmium telluride]] and [[mercury zinc telluride]], [[infrared detector]] materials. 

Laboratory tests have found that an electrical discharge causes the [[noble gases]] to combine with mercury vapor. These compounds are held together with [[van der Waals force]]s and result in HgNe, HgAr, HgKr, and HgXe. Organic mercury [[Chemical compound|compound]]s are also important.  [[Methylmercury]] is a dangerous compound that is widely found as a [[pollution|pollutant]] in water bodies and streams.

See also ''[[:Category:Mercury compounds]]''.

==Isotopes==
There are seven stable [[isotope]]s of mercury with Hg-202 being the most abundant (29.86%). The longest-lived [[radioisotope]]s are Hg-194 with a [[half-life]] of 444 years, and Hg-203 with a half-life of 46.612 days. Most of the remaining radioisotopes have half-lifes that are less than a day.

==Occurrence in the environment==

[[Image:Mercury fremont ice core.png|thumb|right|320px|Amount of atmospheric mercury deposited at Wyoming's Fremont Glacier over the last 270 years.]]
[[Abundance of the chemical elements|Abundance]]
*Crustal ~7<U+00D7>10<sup>-2</sup> mg/kg
*Oceans ~3<U+00D7>10<sup>-5</sup> mg/l

Preindustrial deposition rates of mercury from the atmosphere may be in the range of 4 ng/L in the western USA.  Although that can be considered a natural level of exposure, regional or global sources have significant effects.  Volcanic eruptions can increase the atmospheric source by 4&ndash;6 times.<ref>[http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-051-02/]</ref>

Mercury enters the environment as a pollutant from various industries:
*	coal-fired power plants are the largest source (40% of USA emissions in 1999).<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/mercury/faq.htm#14]</ref>
*	industrial processes
**	[[chlorine]], [[steel]], [[phosphate]] & [[gold]] production
**	metal [[smelting]]
**	manufacture & repair of weather and electronic devices
**     [[incineration]] of municipal waste streams
*       medical applications, including vaccinations
**	[[dentistry]]
**	cosmetic industries
*	laboratory work involving mercury or [[sulfur]] compounds

Mercury also enters into the environment through the disposal (e.g., landfilling, incineration) of certain products. Products containing mercury include: auto parts, [[batteries]], fluorescent bulbs, medical products, thermometers, and thermostats.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/reduce/epr/products/mercury.htm]</ref> Due to health concerns (see below), [[waste management|toxics use reduction]] efforts are cutting back or eliminating mercury in such products. For example, most [[thermometer]]s now use pigmented [[alcohol]] instead of mercury. Mercury thermometers are still occasionally used in the medical field because they are more accurate than alcohol thermometers, though both are being replaced by electronic thermometers. Mercury thermometers are still widely used for certain scientific applications because of their greater accuracy and working range.

One of the worst [[industrial disasters]] in history was caused by the dumping of mercury compounds into [[Minamata]] Bay, Japan. The [[Chisso Corporation]], a [[fertilizer]] and later petrochemical company, was found responsible for polluting the bay from 1932&ndash;1968. It is estimated that over 3,000 people suffered various deformities, severe mercury poisoning symptoms or death from what became known as [[Minamata disease]].

==Health and Environmental Effects==
See [[mercury poisoning]]

==Precautions and regulation==

[[Image:Skull and crossbones.svg|left|40px]]
Mercury should be handled with care. Containers of mercury should be securely sealed to avoid spills and evaporation. Heating of mercury, or compounds of mercury that may decompose when heated, should always be carried out with adequate ventilation in order to avoid human exposure to mercury vapor.

===Occupational exposure===

Due to the health effects of mercury exposure, industrial and commercial uses are regulated in many countries. The [[World Health Organization]], [[OSHA]], and [[NIOSH]] all treat mercury as an occupational hazard, and have established specific occupational exposure limits. Environmental releases and disposal of mercury are regulated in the U.S. primarily by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].

===Mercury in fish===

[[Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have a natural tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often in the form of [[methylmercury]], a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the [[food chain]], such as [[shark]], [[swordfish]], [[king mackerel]], [[albacore tuna]], and [[tilefish]] contain higher concentrations of mercury than others.  This is because mercury is stored in the muscle tissues of fish, and when a predatory fish eats another fish, it assumes the entire body burden of mercury in the consumed fish. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the [[food chain]] amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher, or more, than the species they consume.  This process is called [[biomagnification]]. The complexities associated with mercury fate and transport are relatively succinctly described by USEPA in their 1997 Mercury Study Report to Congress.  Because methylmercury and high levels of elemental mercury can be particularly toxic to unborn or young children, organizations such as the [[U.S. EPA]] and FDA recommend that women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the next one or two years, as well as young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces (one average meal) per week.  In the United States the FDA has an action level for methyl mercury in commercial marine and freshwater fish that is 1.0 parts per million (ppm), and in Canada the limit for the total of mercury content is 0.5 (ppm) [1,2]. 

Species with characteristically low levels of mercury include [[shrimp]], [[tilapia]], [[salmon]], [[pollock]], and [[catfish]] (FDA March 2004). The FDA characterizes shrimp, catfish, pollock, salmon, and canned light tuna as low-mercury seafood, although recent tests have indicated that up to 6 percent of canned light tuna may contain high levels.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/health/chi-0601270193jan27,1,7450296.story Chicago Tribune]</ref>

The effects of consuming fish high in mercury is in dispute with the University of Rochester's study of people in the Republic of the Seychelles.  While there is no doubt high level exposure to methyl mercury is definitely toxic, low level exposure isn't.<ref>[http://www.rochester.edu/pr/releases/med/mercury.htm]</ref>  A recent Harvard Medical School study of mothers and their infants suggests that the nutritional benefits of fish outweigh the effects of mercury.<ref>[http://www.ehponline.org/members/2005/8041/8041.pdf Maternal Fish Consumption, Hair Mercury, and Infant Cognition in a U.S. Cohort]</ref>  In the HMS study, each additional weekly serving of fish consumed by the mother during pregnancy was associated with an increase in infant cognition.

===Release of mercury into the environment===
[[Image:Compact-Flourescent-Bulb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The environmental consideration of mercury use in a particular product can sometimes be complicated. For instance [[compact fluorescent]] light bulbs, which use a very small amount of mercury (in 2004 two-thirds of CFL lamps sold contained 5 mg Hg or less per bulb, while 96 percent contained 10 mg or less), due to their far higher efficiency over [[incandescent bulb]]s actually emit less mercury to the environment when they are powered using energy from a [[coal power plant]].]]
[[Image:CFL bulb mercury use environment.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Mercury use of compact fluorescent bulb vs. incandescent bulb when powered by electricity generated from [[coal]].]]
The primary sources of mercury to the environment are [[fossil fuel]] burning (primarily [[coal]]) and solid waste [[incineration]] (Nriagu & Pacyna, 1988). Power plants in the U.S., according to U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], are one of the main emitters of mercury <U+2014> 48 tonnes a year

The United States [[Clean Air Act (1990)|Clean Air Act]], passed in 1990, put mercury on a list of toxic pollutants which need to be controlled to the greatest possible extent.  Thus, certain industries that emit mercury into the environment must install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT).  However, a March 2005 EPA rule<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/air/mercuryrule/]</ref> took power plants off the list of sources which must reduce mercury to the maximum extent.  Instead, a [[emissions trading|cap and trade]] rule was issued, with most of the reductions in mercury pollution from power plants beginning in the year 2018.  States were also given until November, 2006 to to impose stricter controls, and several states are doing so.  The rule was being subjected to legal challenges from several states in 2005.

===Mercury and aluminium===

Mercury readily combines with [[aluminium]] to form an [[amalgam]] when the two pure metals come into contact.  However, when the amalgam is exposed to air, the aluminium oxidizes, leaving behind mercury.  The oxide flakes away, exposing more mercury amalgam, which repeats the process.  This process continues until the supply of amalgam is exhausted, and since it releases mercury, a small amount of mercury can <U+201C>eat through<U+201D> a large amount of aluminium over time, by progressively forming amalgam and relinquishing the aluminium as oxide.

Aluminium in air is ordinarily protected by a molecule-thin layer of its own oxide (which is not porous to oxygen). Mercury coming into contact with this oxide does no harm.  However, if any elemental aluminium is exposed (even by a recent scratch), the mercury may combine with it, starting the process described above, and potentially damaging a large part of the aluminium before it finally ends (Ornitz 1998).

For this reason, restrictions are placed on the use and handling of mercury in proximity with aluminium.  In particular, mercury is not allowed aboard aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.
