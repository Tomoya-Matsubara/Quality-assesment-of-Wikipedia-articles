== Biography ==

'''Courtland Hector Hoppin''' was born March 12, 1906, the only child of Dorothy Rockhill and Joseph Clark Hoppin. His was a family of wealth and prestige. His paternal grandfather, for whom he was named, was owner of a vast [[Connecticut]] estate with a manor house known as "Courtlands". This estate in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]], became a private boarding school (the [[Pomfret School]]) and the Hoppin family is known to have owned much of what is part of the [[Pomfret Street Historic District]]. Courtland Hoppin the elder (1834--1876) was a physician and practitioner of [[homeopathy]]. Courtland the younger was called by his middle name, Hector, and some of his surviving artwork is signed simply "Hector". Hector's maternal grandfather, [[William Woodville Rockhill]], was a diplomat<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|date= November 27, 1901|title=Hoppin&mdash;Rockhill| quote=WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -- Miss Dorothy Rockhill of this city and Joseph Clarke Hoppin of Boston were married at noon to-day in St. John's Episcopal Church.

== Pioneer work in animation ==

While living in Paris in the 1930s, Hoppin collaborated on several animated films with print-maker and painter [[Anthony Gross]], providing his skill as an artist and photographer as well as the capital for the projects. The first animated film of the company they titled "HG Productions" was ''Une Journ<U+00E9>e en Afrique''. Completed in 1932, it was followed by ''Les Fun<U+00E9>railles'' and, in 1934, with their most popular and successful work, ''La Joie de Vivre''. Hoppin and Gross hired Hungarian composer [[Tibor Harsanyi]] to compose music for the sound track of the film. ''La Joie de Vivre'' is described as a break from the "limiting comic tradition of the 1930s cartoon animation", and its free, decorative style and vague politics permitted its re-release in France during the early 1940s by the Vichy government.<ref name="Neupert2011">{{cite book|author=Richard Neupert|title=French Animation History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AvD7olaX74sC&pg=PT73|date=8 March 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-9257-9|pages=73<U+2013>}}</ref>

The nine-minute film is described in the Internet Movie Database<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286736/</ref>as "A tone poem [in which] two woodland sprites dance about, atop power lines and among flowers and leaves, while being pursued. Everyone spends some time pulling levers to switch trains, too." [[File:Hector Hoppin 1961.jpg|thumb|right|C.H. Hoppin in his Sarasota, Florida, home, December 1961]]

Following the success of this film, the pair produced works titled ''The Storm'' and ''Fox Hunt''.<ref>Art Adoo Galleries biography of Anthony Gross at [http://www.artadoo.com/en/display/artist/name/anthony-gross/id/76370]</ref><ref>''Film & Media at Stephens College'' may be found at [http://stephensfilm.blogspot.com/2009/10/more-animation-joie-de-vivre-1934.html]</ref>''Fox Hunt'' received praise for its use of color "with freedom and beauty quite outside Mr. Disney's picture-book range."<ref name="Greene1994">{{cite book|author=Graham Greene|title=The Graham Greene Film Reader: Reviews, Essays, Interviews & Film Stories|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cC3w5Cwr7X0C&pg=PA155|year=1994|publisher=Applause Theatre Book Publishers|isbn=978-1-55783-188-0|pages=155<U+2013>}}</ref>
In 1938, Hoppin and Gross began their most ambitious work, ''Around the World in Eighty Days'', a color feature based on the [[Jules Verne]] novel financed by [[Alexander Korda]] of London Films.
The project, however, was interrupted by World War II; all traces of the film were thought to have been lost, but in 1956 some negatives were discovered in a projection room at the National Film Theatre in London and efforts were made to piece-together a portion of the original work. The restored section has a running-time of eighteen minutes.<ref name="angelfire">http://www.angelfire.com/film/splodge/vault2/5aug02tintin.html</ref>
:''"A reel of negatives from the London lab of [[Technicolor]] was all that remained. With the assistance of the [[British Film Institute]]'s Experimental Production Fund, contributing some transitional scenes-- such as animated diagrams of the voyage through the Suez Canal-- it was possible to construct a usable, coherent, even vivacious film of great beauty. Hoppin & Gross were innovators. Only the informed eye of a painter could have chosen the colour-pallet;the characters are intelligently animated, caricatured with distinction. Of all the film projects that year arising from producers keen to follow the success of Disney's Snow White, ''Around The Word In 80 Days'' shines like a beacon turned towards the future. Despite some technical weaknesses and its truncated form, the film is a substantial achievement."<ref name="angelfire" />

The [[New York Public Library]] has a copy of this film, titled ''Around the World in Eighteen Minutes'', published by McGraw-Hill in 1962.<ref>information found on line via WorldCat at [http://www.worldcat.org/title/around-the-world-in-eighteen-minutes/oclc/317379424]</ref>
