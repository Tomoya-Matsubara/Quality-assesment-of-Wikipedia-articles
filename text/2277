'''Troilus of Elis''' was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[sportsperson|athlete]] from [[Elis]] who participated at the [[ancient Olympic Games]]. He gained controversy by being a [[referee]] who won two [[equestrianism|equestrian]] events at the [[372 BC]] [[Ancient Olympic Games]]. After that a law banned referees from competing. His story has at times been used to show the ancient games had a "win at any cost" mindset quite different from the modern Olympic ideal.
