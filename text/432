'''Pope Benedict XVI''' ([[Latin]]: ''Benedictus PP. XVI''; [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Benedetto XVI''; [[German language|German]]: ''Benedikt XVI''; born '''Joseph Alois Ratzinger''' on [[16 April]] [[1927]]) is the [[List of popes|265th]] and reigning [[Pope]], by virtue of his office of [[Bishop of Rome]], the spiritual head  of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and as such, [[monarch|Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]].<ref>The precise number of popes has been a matter for scholarly debate for centuries. John A. Hardon's ''Modern Catholic Dictionary'' (1980) lists Pope John Paul II (1978&ndash;2005) as 264th Pope, making Benedict XVI the 265th. </ref> He was elected on [[19 April]] [[2005]] in a [[papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]], celebrated his [[Papal Inauguration]] [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] on [[24 April]], [[2005]], and took possession of his cathedral, the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], on [[7 May]] [[2005]]. Pope Benedict XVI has both German and Vatican [[citizenship]]. He succeeded [[Pope John Paul II]].
 
Benedict XVI is a well-known [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Theology|theologian]] and a prolific [[author]], a defender of traditional Catholic [[doctrine]] and values. He served as a [[professor]] at [[Talk:Pope Benedict XVI/German universities affiliated with Pope Benedict XVI|various German universities]] and was a theological consultant at the [[Second Vatican Council]] before becoming [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]. At the time of his election as Pope, Benedict had been [[Prefect]] of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] ([[Roman Curia|curial]] heads lose their positions upon the death of a pope)<ref>John Paul II, Ap. Const. ''Pastor Bonus'', I, General Norms, Art 6, June 28, 1988</ref> and was [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]].

During his papacy, Benedict XVI has emphasized what he sees as a need for Europe to return to fundamental [[Christian values]] in response to increasing de-[[Christianization|Christianisation]] and [[secularism|secularisation]] in many [[Developed country|developed countries]]. For this reason, he proclaims [[relativism]]'s denial of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective truth]]<U+2014>and more particularly, the denial of moral truths<U+2014>as the central problem of the 21st century. He teaches the importance for the Catholic Church and for humanity of contemplating [[God]]'s salvific love and has reaffirmed the "importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work."

==Overview==
[[Image:Pope Benedictus XVI january,20 2006 (2) mod.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI at a private audience on January 20, 2006.]]
Benedict XVI was [[Papal election|elected]] Pope at the age of 78. He is the [[List of ages of Popes|oldest person to have been elected Pope]] since [[Pope Clement XII]] (1730&ndash;40). He had served longer as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] than any Pope since [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1724&ndash;30). He is the ninth German Pope, the eighth having been the Dutch-German [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522&ndash;23) from [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. The last Pope named Benedict was [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], an [[Italy|Italian]] who reigned from 1914 to 1922, during [[World War I]] (1914&ndash;18).

Born in 1927 in [[Marktl am Inn]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], Ratzinger had a distinguished career as a university [[theology|theologian]] before being appointed [[Archbishop of Munich and Freising]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] (1963&ndash;78). Shortly afterwards, he was made a cardinal in the [[consistory]] of [[June 27]], [[1977]]. He was appointed Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and was also assigned the honorific title of the [[cardinal bishop of Velletri-Segni]] on [[April 5]], [[1993]]. In 1998, he was elected sub-dean of the [[College of Cardinals]]. And on [[November 30]], [[2002]], he was elected dean, taking, as is customary, the title of Cardinal bishop of the suburbicarian diocese of [[Bishop of Ostia|Ostia]]. He was the first Dean of the College elected Pope since [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] (1555&ndash;59) and the first [[cardinal bishop]] elected Pope since [[Pope Pius VIII|Pius VIII]] (1829&ndash;30).

Even before becoming Pope, Ratzinger was one of the most influential men in the [[Roman Curia]], and was a close associate of  John Paul II. As Dean of the College of Cardinals, he presided over the [[funeral of John Paul II]] and over the Mass immediately preceding the 2005 conclave in which he was elected. During the service, he called on the assembled cardinals to hold fast to the doctrine of the faith. He was the public face of the church in the ''[[sede vacante]]'' period, although, technically, he ranked below the ''[[camerlengo]]'' in administrative authority during that time. Like his predecessor, Benedict XVI maintains the traditional Catholic doctrines on artificial [[birth control]], [[abortion]] and [[homosexuality]].

As well as his native [[German language|German]], Benedict XVI fluently speaks [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Latin]], and has a knowledge of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. He can read [[Ancient Greek]] and biblical [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite web|last=[[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]|title=Pope Benedict XVI: Quick Facts|url=http://www.usccb.org/comm/popebenedictxvi/benedictfacts.shtml|accessdate=2007-11-04}}</ref> He has stated that his first foreign language is French. He is a member of a large number of academies, such as the French ''[[Acad<U+00E9>mie des sciences morales et politiques]]''. He plays the [[piano]] and has a preference for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]].<ref>{{cite web | last = [[BBC News]] | title = Pope Benedict's creature comforts | date = 13 May 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4539613.stm  | accessdate = 2007-05-13 }}</ref>

{{main|Early life of Pope Benedict XVI}}
Joseph Alois Ratzinger was born on [[16 April]], [[Holy Saturday]], 1927 at Schulstra<U+00DF>e 11, at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in [[Marktl am Inn]], [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]]. He was baptized the same day. He was the third and youngest child of [[Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.]], a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (n<U+00E9>e Peintner). His mother's family was originally from [[South Tyrol]]. Pope Benedict XVI's brother, [[Georg Ratzinger]], a priest and former director of the [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] choir, is still alive. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991. Their great-uncle was the German politician [[Georg Ratzinger (politician)|Georg Ratzinger]].

The pope's relatives agree that his priestly vocation was apparent from boyhood.{{Fact|date=January 2008}} At the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting [[Archbishop of Munich|Cardinal Archbishop of Munich]] with flowers. Struck by the Cardinal's distinctive garb, he later announced the very same day that he wanted to be a cardinal.

Following his fourteenth birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the [[Hitler Youth]] <U+2014> as membership was required for all 14-year old German boys after December 1939<ref>The Third Reich in Power, Richard J Evans, 2005, pg 272</ref> <U+2014> but was an unenthusiastic member and refused to attend meetings.<ref>{{cite web | last = [[The New York Times]] | title = New Pope Defied Nazis As Teen During WWII | date = 23 April 2005 | url = http://bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/texts/cjrelations/topics/new_pope_defied_nazis.htm  | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}</ref> His father was a bitter enemy of [[Nazism]], believing it conflicted with the Catholic faith, according to biographer [[John L. Allen, Jr.]] In 1941, one of Ratzinger's cousins, a 14-year-old boy with [[Down syndrome]], was killed by the Nazi regime in its campaign of [[eugenics]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Allen |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Anti-Nazi Prelate Beatified |url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word101405.htm#five |work=The Word from Rome |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2008-04-15 }}</ref> In 1943 while still in seminary, he was drafted at age 16 into the German anti-aircraft corps. Ratzinger then trained in the German infantry, but a subsequent illness precluded him from the usual rigours of military duty. As the Allied front drew closer to his post in 1945, he deserted back to his family's home in Traunstein after his unit had ceased to exist, just as American troops established their headquarters in the Ratzinger household. As a German soldier, he was put in a POW camp but was released a few months later at the end of the War in summer 1945. He reentered the seminary, along with his brother Georg, in November of that year. 

Following repatriation in 1945, the two brothers entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein, later studying at the [[Ducal Georgianum]] (''Herzogliches Georgianum'') of the [[Ludwig-Maximilian University]] in Munich. They were both ordained in [[Freising]] on [[June 29]], [[1951]] by Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] of Munich. Joseph Ratzinger's dissertation (1953) was on [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and was entitled "The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church". His [[Habilitation]] (which qualified him for a professorship) was on [[Bonaventure]]. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of [[Freising]] College in 1958.

==Pre-papal career==
===Academic career (1951&ndash;1977)===

Ratzinger became a professor at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1959; his inaugural lecture was on "The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy." In 1963, he moved to the [[University of M<U+00FC>nster]], where his inaugural lecture was given in a packed lecture hall, as he was already well known as a theologian{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. 

During this period, Ratzinger participated in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962&ndash;1965). Ratzinger served as a ''[[peritus]]'' (theological consultant) to [[Josef Frings|Josef Cardinal Frings of Cologne]]. He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with radical [[Modernism|Modernist]] theologians like [[Hans K<U+00FC>ng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]]. Ratzinger became an admirer of [[Karl Rahner]], a well-known academic theologian of the [[Nouvelle Th<U+00E9>ologie]] and a proponent of church reform.

In 1966, Joseph Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of T<U+00FC>bingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans K<U+00FC>ng]]. In his 1968 book ''Introduction to Christianity'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. He also wrote that the Church of the time was too centralized, rule-bound and overly controlled from Rome {{Fact|date=February 2007}}. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of T<U+00FC>bingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalized, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings.<ref name="sobene">David Van Biema, ''[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050502/sobenedict.html The Turning Point]'', [[Time (magazine)|Time]], [[April 24]], [[2005]]</ref> Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.<ref>Daniel J Wakin, "[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/international/worldspecial2/24ratzinger.html?position=&incamp=article_popular_5&pagewanted=print&position= Turbulence on Campus in 60's Hardened Views of Future Pope]", ''New York Times'', [[April 24]] [[2005]] (accessed [[June 8]] [[2005]])</ref>

Some voices, among them Hans K<U+00FC>ng, deem this a turn towards [[Conservatism]], while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, "I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]".<ref>Time Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979775-1,00.html Keeper of the Straight and Narrow] [[December 6]], [[1993]]</ref> Ratzinger has continued to defend the Council against criticism, including ''[[Nostra Aetate]],'' the document on respect of other religions, [[ecumenism]] and the declaration of the right to [[freedom of religion]]. (Later, as the [[Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which also talks about the Roman Catholic way to engage in ''[[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue''.)

During his years at T<U+00FC>bingen University, Ratzinger publicized articles in the reformist theological journal ''[[Concilium]]'', though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as [[Hans K<U+00FC>ng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]].

In 1969, he returned to [[Bavaria]], to the [[University of Regensburg]]. He founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'', with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Kasper]] and others, in 1972. ''Communio,'' now published in seventeen languages, including [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], has become a prominent [[journal]] of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as Pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors.

===Archbishop of Munich and Freising (1977&ndash;1982)===
[[Image:Palais Holnstein Munich.JPG|thumb|left|[[Palais Holnstein]] in [[Munich]], the residence of Benedict as Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]
On [[March 24]], [[1977]], Ratzinger was appointed [[Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. He took as his episcopal [[motto]] ''Cooperatores Veritatis'' (Co-workers of the Truth) from [[Third Epistle of John|3 John]] 8, a choice he comments upon in his autobiographical work, ''Milestones''.
In the [[consistory]] of the following [[June 27]], he was named [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal Priest]] of ''[[Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino]]'' by [[Pope Paul VI]]. By the time of the 2005 Conclave, he was one of only fourteen remaining cardinals appointed by Paul VI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80. Of these, only he and [[William Wakefield Baum]] took part in the conclave.<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502405.htm Catholic News, John Thavis and Cindy Wooden]</ref>

=== Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (1981&ndash;2005) ===
{{main|Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith}}
[[Image:Ratzinger Szczepanow 2003 6.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cardinal Ratzinger in [[2003]].]]
On [[November 25]], [[1981]], Pope John Paul II named Ratzinger Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], formerly known as the [[Holy Office]], the historical [[Inquisition]]. Consequently, he resigned his post at Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the [[College of Cardinals]] to become Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993, was made the College's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002.

In office, Ratzinger fulfilled his institutional role, defending and reaffirming Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as [[birth control]], [[homosexuality]], and inter-religious dialogue. During his period in office, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] took disciplinary measures against some outspoken [[Liberation theology|liberation theologians]] in [[Latin America]], condemning liberation theology twice (in 1984 and 1986), accusing it of Marxist tendencies and of inciting hate and violence{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. [[Leonardo Boff]], for example, was suspended, while others were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of [[Jesuit]] priest [[Anthony de Mello (priest)|Anthony de Mello]] were the subject of a ''notification''.  Ratzinger and the Congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (''i.e.'', Christ was "one master alongside others"). 

The Congregation is best known for its authority over the teaching of Church doctrine, but it also has jurisdiction over other matters, including cases involving the seal of the confessional, clerical sexual misconduct and other matters, in its function as what amounts to a court. In his capacity as Prefect, Ratzinger's 2001 letter <U+201C>Crimen Sollicitationis<U+201D> which clarified the confidentiality of internal Church investigations into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including [[sexual abuse]], became a target of controversy during the [[Roman Catholic sex abuse cases|sex abuse scandal]].<ref>Jamie Doward, ''[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1469055,00.html Pope 'obstructed' sex abuse inquiry]'', [[The Observer]], [[2005-04-24]]; Accessed [[2007-07-14]]</ref> While bishops hold the secrecy pertained only internally, and did not preclude investigation by civil law enforcement, the letter was often seen as promoting a coverup.<ref>{{cite web | title=UK Bishops Angered by BBC Attack on Pope | date=2006-10-02 | accessdate=2008-04-14 | url= http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=71831 | publisher=Catholic News Agency}}</ref>

On [[March 12]], [[1983]] Ratzinger as prefect and cardinal notified the lay faithful and the [[clergy]] that [[archbishop]] [[Pierre Martin Ngo Dinh Thuc]] had incurred the [[excommunication]] [[latae sententiae]] for [[valid but illicit|illicit]] [[ordination|episcopal consecrations]] without the apostolic mandate.

===Health===

Because of age-related health problems, and in order to have free time to write, he had hoped to retire, and submitted his resignation three times, but had continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In the early 1990s, Ratzinger suffered a [[stroke]], which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily. This was known to the Conclave that elected him Pope. In August 1992, on a vacation in the [[Alps]], he fell and struck his head against a radiator. In May 2005, the Vatican revealed that he had subsequently suffered another mild stroke; it did not reveal when, other than that it had occurred between 2003 and 2005. [[France]]'s [[Philippe Cardinal Barbarin]] further revealed that since the first stroke, Ratzinger had been suffering from a heart condition as a result of his age, and is currently on medication. It is also notable that he appears to be in far better health than his predecessor was at the age of 79.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1592856,00.html "Pope has had second stroke"], ''The Sunday Times'', (London) [[May 1]] [[2005]].</ref> In late November 2006, an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, and that the [[bronchitis]] suffered by the Pope has put undue pressure on the Pope's heart.<ref>[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5510527.asp?gid=74 Vatican: Pope Benedict's gaffes result of high tension]</ref>

==Papacy==

===Election to the papacy===
{{main|Papal conclave, 2005}}
====Prediction====
On [[January 2]], [[2005]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] should the pope die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7&ndash;1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by ''Time'' magazine. While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near [[Regensburg]] and dedicate himself to writing books.

Piers Paul Read wrote in ''[[The Spectator (1828)|The Spectator]]'' on [[March 5]], [[2005]]:

{{cquote|There can be little doubt that his courageous promotion of orthodox Catholic teaching has earned him the respect of his fellow cardinals throughout the world. He is patently holy, highly intelligent and sees clearly what is at stake. Indeed, for those who blame the decline of Catholic practice in the developed world precisely on the propensity of many European bishops to hide their heads in the sand, a pope who confronts it may be just what is required. Ratzinger is no longer young&mdash;he is 78 years old: but Angelo Roncalli, who revolutionized Catholicism by calling the Second Vatican Council was almost the same age (76) when he became pope as [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. As Jeff Israely, the correspondent of ''Time'', was told by a Vatican insider last month, "The Ratzinger solution is definitely on."}}

Though Ratzinger was increasingly considered the front runner by much of the international media, others maintained that his election was far from certain since very few papal predictions in modern history had come true. The elections of both [[John Paul II]] and his predecessor, [[John Paul I]] had been rather unexpected. Despite being the favorite (or perhaps because he was the favorite), it was a surprise to many that he was actually elected, as traditionally the frontrunners are passed over by the conclave for someone else.

==== Election ====
On [[April 19]], [[2005]], Cardinal Ratzinger was elected as the successor to Pope John Paul II on the second day of the [[Papal conclave, 2005|papal conclave]] after four ballots. Cardinal Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that "At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me."<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/25/pope.monday/ http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/25/pope.monday/] Quote from a CNN Interview, [[April 25]] [[2005]].</ref> Coincidentally, [[April 19]] is the feast of St. [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]], the most important German pope of the [[Middle Ages]], known for instituting major reforms during his pontificate.

Before his first appearance at the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] after becoming pope, he was announced by [[Jorge Medina Est<U+00E9>vez]], protodeacon of the College of Cardinals. Cardinal Medina Est<U+00E9>vez first addressed the massive crowd as "dear(est) brothers and sisters" in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional ''[[Habemus Papam]]'' announcement in Latin.

At the balcony, Benedict's first words to the crowd, given in Italian before he gave the traditional ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing in Latin, were:
{{cquote|Dear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the Cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord. The fact that the Lord knows how to work and to act even with insufficient instruments comforts me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers. In the joy of the Risen Lord, confident of his unfailing help, let us move forward. The Lord will help us, and Mary, His Most Holy Mother, will be on our side. Thank you.<ref>Official translation taken from [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/index_en.htm www.vatican.va]</ref>}}

On [[April 24]], he celebrated the [[Papal Inauguration|Papal Inauguration Mass]] in [[St. Peter's Square]], during which he was invested with the [[Pallium]] and the [[Ring of the Fisherman]]. Then, on [[May 7]], he took possession of his Cathedral church, the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]].

===Choice of name===
Ratzinger chose the [[regnal name|pontifical name]] Benedict, which in Latin means "the blessed", in honor of both [[Pope Benedict XV]] and [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]]. Pope Benedict XV was Pope during the [[World War I|first World War]], during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine Order) and the author of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity.

Benedict XVI explained his choice of name during his first [[General Audience]] in St. Peter's Square, on April 27, 2005:

{{cquote|Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember [[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war. In his footsteps I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples. Additionally, I recall [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-[[Patron saint|patron]] of [[Europe]], whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe. I ask him to help us all to hold firm to the centrality of Christ in our Christian life: May Christ always take first place in our thoughts and actions!<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20050427_en.html Pope Benedict XVI's General Audience Speech], The Vatican, April 27, 2005.</ref>}}

=== Tone of papacy ===
[[Image:Benedikt XVI im Papamobil.jpg|thumb|200px|Pope Benedict XVI's first trip in the [[Popemobile]]]]

During his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the Pope was replaced by having twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly [[confirmation|confirmed]] people, greet him. (The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He has begun using an open-topped [[Popemobile|papal car]], saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict has continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptizes several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of every year, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.

[[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict's coat of arms]] has omitted the [[papal tiara]], which traditionally appears in the background to designate the Pope's position as a worldly ruler like a king, replacing it with a simple [[mitre]], emphasizing his spiritual authority.<ref name="Vatican-COA">[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html Coat of Arms of His Holiness Benedict XVI], The Vatican.</ref> Although some papal documents since his inauguration appear to include the papal tiara, this is because the arms of the [[Holy See]] itself (as opposed to his personal arms) continue to use the tiara and crossed keys, as can be observed, for example, on the website of the Holy See and other official publications. Because it is the shield alone (regardless of its background elements) which is unique to the individual Pope, varying backgrounds are possible for a single shield, though this is rarely done.  Pope Benedict XVI also included a traditional [[pallium]] beneath his shield as a background element for his arms, emphasizing his pastoral powers.

====Beatifications====
On [[May 9]], [[2005]], Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, [[Camillo Ruini]], [[Vicar General]] of the [[Holy See|Diocese of Rome]] and the official responsible for promoting the [[Canonization|cause for canonization]] of any person who dies within that diocese, cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. The "exceptional circumstances" apparently refer to the cries of "Santo subito!" ("Saint now!") during  pontiff's funeral (saints can be declared by popular acclaim, although this is rare). Therefore, the Pope waived the five year rule "so that the cause of Beatification and Canonization of the same Servant of God can begin immediately."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html Vatican.va - Canonisation of Pope John Paul II]</ref> The decision was announced on [[May 13]], [[2005]], the Feast of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=70889 Canonization process]</ref> John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fatima for preserving him on that day. Cardinal Ruini inaugurated the diocesan phase of the cause for beatification in the Lateran Basilica on [[June 28]], [[2005]].<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=73395 Inauguration of beatification process]</ref>

The first beatification under the new Pope was celebrated on [[May 14]], [[2005]], by [[Jos<U+00E9> Cardinal Saraiva Martins]]. The new Blesseds were [[Mother Marianne Cope]] and [[Mother Ascensi<U+00F3>n Nicol Go<U+00F1>i]]. [[Mariano de la Mata]] was beatified in November 2006 and [[Rosa Eluvathingal]] was beatified December 3 of that year, and Fr. [[Basil Moreau]] is scheduled to be beatified by next year. In October 2008 the following beatifications will take place: [[Celestine of the Mother of God]], [[Giuseppina Nicoli]], [[Hendrina Stenmanns]], [[Maria Rosa Flesch]], [[Marta Anna Wiecka]], [[Michal Sopocko]], [[Petrus Kibe Kasui and 187 Companions]], [[Susana Paz-Castillo Ramirez]].

Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a Cardinal. On [[September 29]], [[2005]], the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued a communiqu<U+00E9> announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the Pope, usually the Prefect of that Congregation.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_comunicato_en.html Vatican.va - Communiqu<U+00E9> on beatification process]</ref>

==== Canonizations ====
Pope Benedict XVI celebrated his first canonizations on [[October 23]], [[2005]] in [[St. Peter's Square]] when he canonized [[Josef Bilczewski]], [[Saint Alberto Hurtado|Alberto Hurtado SJ]], [[Zygmunt Gorazdowski]], [[Gaetano Catanoso]], and [[Felice da Nicosia]]. The canonizations were part of a Mass that marked the conclusion of the [[Synod of Bishops]] and the [[Year of the Eucharist]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20051023_canonizations_en.html First Canonizations]</ref> Pope Benedict XVI canonized [[Rafael Guizar Valencia|Bishop Rafael Guizar y Valencia]], [[Theodore Guerin|Mother Theodore Guerin]], [[Filippo Smaldone]], and [[Rosa Venerini]] on [[October 15]], [[2006]].

During his visit to Brazil in 2007, Pope Benedict XVI presided over the canonization of [[Frei Galv<U+00E3>o]] on May 11, while [[George Preca]], founder of the Malta based MUSEUM, [[Szymon of Lipnica]], [[Charles of Mount Argus]], and [[Marie-Eug<U+00E9>nie de J<U+00E9>sus]] were canonized in a ceremony held at the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] on [[June 3]] 2007.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/vnews/getstory.asp?number=76178 Canonizations in May-June 2007]</ref> Preca is the first Maltese saint since the country's conversion to Christianity in [[Anno Domini|A.D. 60]] when St. Paul converted the inhabitants. {{Fact|date=May 2007}} In October 2008 the following canonizations will take place: [[Alphonsa Muttathupadathu|Saint Alphonsa of India]],<ref>[http://www.oecumene.radiovaticana.org/en1/Articolo.asp?c=190137 Pope Announces Canonisation of India's First Native Woman Saint] from [[Vatican Radio]]</ref> [[Gaetano Errico]], [[Narcisa de Jesus Martillo Moran]], [[Mar<U+00ED>a Bernarda B<U+00FC>tler]]

===Curia reform===
{{Politics of the Vatican City}}
Pope Benedict began downsizing the [[Roman Curia]] when he merged four existing pontifical councils into two in March 2006. The [[Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples|Pontifical Council for Migrants]] was merged with the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]] headed by [[Renato Martino|Cardinal Martino]]. Likewise, [[Paul Poupard|Cardinal Poupard]], who headed the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]], now also oversees the operations of what had been the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], though both Councils maintained separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged. In May 2007 it was decided that Interreligious Dialogue would again become a separate body under a different President.

===Teachings===
{{seealso|Theology of Pope Benedict XVI}}

As Pope, Benedict XVI's main role is to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith, a role that he can play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in [[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI]].

===="Friendship with Jesus Christ"====
[[Image:Ratzinger Szczepanow Derivative.png|left|thumb|140px|Benedict XVI:  "The Eucharist is the enduring presence of Jesus' self-oblation." (''[[Deus Caritas Est]]'')]]
According to commentators, during the Inaugural Mass, the core of the Pope's message, the most moving and famous part, is found in the last paragraph of his homily where he referred to both [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] and John Paul II. After referring to John Paul II's well-known words, "Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!", Benedict XVI said:

{{cquote|Are we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to Him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us?...And once again the Pope said: No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation....When we give ourselves to Him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ <U+2013> and you will find true life.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html Vatican.va - Homily on Christ]</ref>}}

"Friendship with Jesus Christ" is a frequent theme of his preaching.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/B16CLERO.HTM Address to the priests of Rome]</ref><ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/pope/words/conclave_homily.asp Address to cardinals pre-conclave]</ref><ref>[Address to the public]</ref>  He stressed that on this intimate friendship, "everything depends."<ref name=JON/> He has also said: "We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is all we have to do is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history."<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfjosma.htm ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (9 October 2002) "St. [[Josemar<U+00ED>a Escriv<U+00E1>]] and [[Opus Dei]]: God is very much at work in our world today".]</ref> Thus, in his book ''Jesus of Nazareth'', his main purpose was "to help foster [in the reader] the growth of a living relationship" with Jesus Christ.<ref name=JON>[http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=105964 Jesus of Nazareth]</ref>

He took up this theme in his first encyclical ''[[Deus Caritas Est]]''. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: "If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them."<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=84108 Address on Friendship with God]</ref> Thus, he said that [[prayer]] is "urgently needed...It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work."

===="Dictatorship of Relativism"====
Continuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he has often referred to as the "central problem of our faith today",<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM Address on Dictatorship of relativism] accessed August 5 2006.</ref> on [[June 6]],  [[2005]] Pope Benedict also said:
{{cquote|Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that [[relativism]] which, recognizing nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own ego.<ref> [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html Inaugural Address at the Ecclesial Diocesan Convention] accessed April 27, 2007.</ref>}}

He said that "a dictatorship of [[relativism]]"<ref>[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm Dictatorship of relativism]</ref> was the core challenge facing the church and humanity. At the root of this problem, he said, is [[Kant]]'s "self-limitation of reason". This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of [[science]], whose excellence is based on the power of [[reason]] to know the [[truth]]. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as [[terrorism]] and pathologies of science such as [[List of environmental disasters|ecological disasters]].<ref name=TT>Ratzinger, ''Truth and Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions'', Ignatius Press, 2004</ref> Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent [[ideologies]] of the twentieth century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides. He said "Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called [[totalitarianism]]."<ref>[[Benedict XVI]], [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050820_vigil-wyd_en.html Address to the World Youth Day], Cologne, August 20, 2005</ref>

In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of [[St. John Lateran]] [[June 6]], [[2005]], Benedict remarked on the issues of [[same sex marriage]] and [[abortion]]:
:The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born.<ref>[http://www1.wsvn.com/news/articles/world/DBB1185/ "Pope Condemns Same-Sex Unions As 'Pseudo-Matrimony,' Reaffirms Opposition To Abortion"], WSVN-TV, [[June 6]] [[2005]].</ref>

====Christianity as the Religion according to Reason====

In the discussion with [[secularism]] and [[rationalism]], one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the "Crisis of Culture" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the Religion of the [[Word]] (the original Greek, [[Logos]], meaning reason, meaning, or intelligence). He said:
{{cquote|From the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the ''Logos'', as the religion according to reason...It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the Enlightenment is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development<U+2014>or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the ''Logos'', from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=74864 Address on Christianity as the Religion according to Reason]</ref>}}

Benedict thus endorses creative reason, manifested in the crucified God as love, which contrasts with the strict rationality of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Pope Benedict has to date written two [[encyclical]]s, [[Deus Caritas Est]] ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "God is Love"), and [[Spe Salvi]] ("Saved by Hope").  

In his first encyclical, "God is love", he said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, is able to practice [[love]]: to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]), by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation ([[eros]]). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them in [[Jesus Christ]].<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html Pope Benedict XVI, papal encyclical, Deus Caritas Est.]</ref>

The encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs.  The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in [[German language|German]], his [[mother tongue]], in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by his predecessor, [[Pope John Paul II]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2009408,00.html Pope's first encyclical is disquisition on love and sex] (''[[The Times]]'', [[25 January]], [[2006]])</ref>  The document was signed by Pope Benedict on [[Christmas Day]], [[25 December]] [[2005]].<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0507411.htm The pope needs a theologian?

Pope Benedict's second encyclical titled [[Spe Salvi]] ("Saved by Hope"), about the virtue of [[hope]], was released on [[November 30]] [[2007]].<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=26059  BREAKING: People need God to have hope, pope says in new encyclical]</ref><ref>Website of the [[Holy See|Vatican]]:[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/index_en.htm Encyclicals] [[Spe Savli]]</ref> 
His third encyclical will be social in nature, and reportedly an extension of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s encyclical [[Populorum Progressio]], and will be title Caritas in Veritate (charity in truth).<ref>[http://whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com/2007/08/populorum-progressio-part-deux.html Populorum Progressio, Part Deux ]</ref>

====Post-synodal apostolic exhortation====

''[[Sacramentum Caritatis]]''  (The Sacrament of Charity) signed [[22 February]] [[2007]], released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, and Polish. It was made available in various languages [[March 13]] [[2007]] in Rome. The English edition from ''Libera Editrice Vaticana'' is 158 pages. This exhortation "seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the recent Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops..." which was held in 2006.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20070222_sacramentum-caritatis_en.html Sacramentum Caritatis] 5</ref>

====Motu proprio on Tridentine Mass====
{{seealso|Summorum Pontificum}}
[[Image:unchurch.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-1969 [[Latin Rite]] altar with [[reredos]].<br><small> The [[high altar]] of a church was usually preceded by three steps, below which were said the [[Prayers at the Foot of the Altar]]. Side altars usually had only one step.</small>]]
On [[7 July]] 2007, Benedict XVI issued the ''[[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]]'', declaring that upon "the request of the faithful", celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] according to the [[Tridentine Mass|Missal of 1962]] (commonly known as the [[Tridentine Mass]]), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest.<ref name="Afica Latin">{{cite news|title=Pope Allows Worldwide Use of Old Latin Mass|publisher=Catholic Information Service for Africa|date=10 July 2007|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707101009.html}}</ref> While ''Summorum Pontificum'' directs that pastors should provide the [[Tridentine Mass]] upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish.<ref name="letter Motu">{{cite web|title=Letter of His Holiness Benedict Xvi to the Bishops on the Occasion of the Publication of the Apostolic Letter ''Motu Proprio Data'' Summorum Pontificum, On the Use of the Roman Liturgy Prior To The Reform of 1970|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html|author=Pope Benedict XVI}}</ref> For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.<ref>Article 5 <U+00A7>4 of the motu proprio</ref> 

In an accompanying letter, the Pope outlined his position concerning questions about the new guidelines,<ref name="letter Motu"/> emphasizing that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the [[Second Vatican Council]], and that the [[Mass of Paul VI]] would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass in that form. He pointed out that use of Tridentine Mass "was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted."<ref name="letter Motu"/> The letter also decried "deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the new Missal" as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen "as authorizing or even requiring creativity", mentioning his own experience.<ref name="letter Motu"/> 

The Pope also considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request it was a means to prevent [[schism]], stating that, on occasions in past history, "not enough was done by the Church<U+2019>s leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity" and that this "imposes an obligation on us today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew.<ref name="letter Motu"/> Many feel the decree aimed at ending the schism between the Holy See and traditionalist groups such as the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX). [[Dar<U+00ED>o Castrill<U+00F3>n Hoyos|Dar<U+00ED>o Castrill<U+00F3>n Cardinal Hoyos]], the president of the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission that oversees the Tridentine Mass]] stated that the decree "opened the door for their return," and said "I wouldn't understand if they don't come back." Bishop Bernard Fellay, superior general of the SSPX, expressed "deep gratitude to the Sovereign Pontiff for this great spiritual benefit."<ref name="Afica Latin"/>, but also said that the group "had to iron out doctrinal differences with the Vatican before a reconciliation could take place."

Some Jewish groups criticized the move because of [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews|petitions]] for the conversion of the Jews included in the Tridentine Good Friday liturgy, which had been reworded by the liturgical reforms.<ref name="Jason">{{cite news|title=Criticism over return of Latin Mass|author=Jason Burke|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070955601600.htm|publisher=The Hindu International}}</ref> Some Catholic voices feared that the move would entail a reversal of the Second Vatican Council.<ref name="Jason"/>

====Unicity and Salvific Universality of the Church====
Near the end of June 2007, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] issued a document approved by Benedict XVI "because some contemporary theological interpretations of [[Vatican II]]'s ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt."<ref name="WINFIELD">{{cite news|title=Pope: Other Christians not true churches |author=NICOLE WINFIELD|publisher=Associated Press|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070710/ap_on_re_eu/pope_other_christians}}</ref> The document has been seen as restating "key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, ''Dominus Iesus''."<ref name="WINFIELD"/>

The document issued on June 29, 2007 stated in part that "oriental Churches [i.e. [[Eastern Christianity]]] ...[merit the title sister Churches] Because these Churches, although separated, have true [[sacrament]]s and above all <U+2013> because of the [[apostolic succession]] <U+2013> the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] and the [[Eucharist]], by means of which they remain linked to us [Roman Catholicism] by very close bonds. ...However, since [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] with the Catholic Church, the visible head of which is [[Pope|the Bishop of Rome and the Successor of Peter]], is not some external complement to a particular Church but rather one of its internal constitutive principles, these venerable Christian communities lack something in their condition as particular churches."<ref name="Levada">William Cardinal Levada, Angelo Amato, S.D.B.; ratified and confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI, ''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church], [[June 29]], [[2007]].</ref>
{{Quote_box |width=35% |align=left|quote="These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called "Churches" in the proper sense."|source=Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith<ref name="Levada"/>}}
The document went on to say "[[Protestantism|Christian Communities born out of the Reformation of the sixteenth century]]... do not enjoy apostolic succession in the sacrament of Orders, and are, therefore, deprived of a constitutive element of the Church. These ecclesial Communities which, specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood, have not preserved the genuine and integral substance of the Eucharistic Mystery cannot, according to Catholic doctrine, be called "Churches" in the proper sense."<ref name="Levada"/>

The document stated that "the full identity of the Church of Christ" is the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name="Levada"/> It said that the Catholic Church notes "that there are 'numerous elements of sanctification and of truth' which are found outside her structure, but which 'as gifts properly belonging to the Church of Christ, impel towards Catholic Unity'. It follows that these separated churches and Communities, though we believe they suffer from defects, are deprived neither of significance nor importance in the mystery of salvation. In fact the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as instruments of salvation, whose value derives from that fullness of grace and of truth which has been entrusted to the Catholic Church."<ref name="Levada"/>

The approval of the document drew some criticism, such as the statement by the [[World Alliance of Reformed Churches]] which said "It makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for Christian unity."<ref name="WINFIELD"/> The statement continued that the document "makes us question the seriousness with which the Roman Catholic Church takes its dialogues with the Reformed family and other families of the church". The leading [[Lutheran]] cleric in Germany Bishop Wolfgang Huber wondered why no attempt was made to use more diplomatic language saying, "it would also be completely sufficient if it were to be said that the reforming churches are 'not churches in the sense required here' or that they are 'churches of another type' <U+2014> but none of these bridges is used" in the Vatican document."<ref name="WINFIELD"/> Others, such as Rev. Sara MacVane, of the [[Anglican]] Centre in Rome, saw it as in line with the previous position of the Church but questioned the timing of its release, saying "I don't know what motivated it at this time."<ref name="WINFIELD"/> The [[Russian Orthodox Church]], however, called the document "honest", noting that it contains nothing new and was conducive to "an  honest  theological dialogue."<ref>{{cite web|title=Vatican's honest position furthers dialogue - Metropolitan Kirill|url=http://www.interfax.com/3/291728/news.aspx}}</ref> The issuing of this document and the recent allowance made by Benedict XVI for more widespread use of the traditional [[Tridentine Mass]] was seen by some of his critics as a move towards conservatism, some even "raised questions about Benedict<U+2019>s commitment to the changes made during the Second Vatican Council."<ref>{{cite news|title=Pope, Restating 2000 Document, Cites 'Defects' of Other Faiths|author=IAN FISHER|date=July 11, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/world/europe/11pope.html?_r=1&ref=world&oref=slogin}}</ref><br />

====Consumerism====
{{section-stub}}
Benedict XVI has condemned excessive [[consumerism]], especially among youth.  He stated in [[December 2007]] that "[A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/08/europe/EU-GEN-Vatican-Youth-Consumerism.php|title=Pope: ever-younger children led by adults into consumerism|publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=[[December 8]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref>

===Ecumenical efforts===

Speaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on [[7 June]] [[2006]], Pope Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. "Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ," said Pope Benedict. "Let us pray so that the primacy of Peter, entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us." The Catholic Church teaches that the Pope has a leading role among Christians because as Bishop of Rome he is successor to the apostle Peter who first held the office. The role of the papacy remains a source of controversy, not only for [[Protestant]] denominations but also for [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches, who likewise do not accept Petrine primacy as defined at the [[First Vatican Council]].<ref>[http://www.eni.ch/articles/display.shtml?06-0459 Benedict's call on papacy will increase divisions, says Italian Protestant]</ref>

====Dissident Catholics====

On [[August 29]], [[2006]], Pope Benedict XVI met with [[Bernard Fellay|Bishop Bernard Fellay]] of the traditionalist [[Society of St. Pius X]], an international society of traditionalist Roman Catholic priests, which since 1975 has existed in a state of dispute with the leadership of the Roman Catholic Church.  Bishop Fellay had previously issued a statement welcoming the election of Cardinal Ratzinger as Pope.<ref>[http://www.sspx.org/superior_generals_ltrs/papal/on_the_election_of_pope_benedict_xvi.htm SSPX PRESS                COMMUNIQU<U+00C9>: On the election of Pope Benedict XVI]</ref>

====Orthodox====

The bishops of the Ecumenical [[Orthodox]] [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] have expressed concern over Pope Benedict XVI's decision to strike out "patriarch of the West" from his official titles in the Vatican yearbook. In a [[June 8]], [[2006]] statement, the chief secretary of the [[Orthodox]] bishops' synod said dropping "patriarch of the West" while retaining the titles "vicar of Jesus Christ" and "supreme pontiff of the universal church" is "perceived as implying a universal jurisdiction of the bishop of Rome over the entire church, a claim that the [[Orthodox]] have never accepted." The statement was issued after synod members discussed the change during their early June meeting. [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Walter Kasper]], president of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]], said in a March statement that dropping the title of patriarch in reference to the pope does not minimize the importance of the patriarchal office, particularly in relation to the ancient Eastern churches. "Even less can this suppression be seen as implying new claims" of power or authority on the part of the Vatican, he said. However, members of the Orthodox synod disagreed. From their point of view, "the geographical limits of each ecclesiastical jurisdiction" have been a key part of the structure of the church from the earliest days of Christianity. The church as a whole is "a unity of full local churches" and not a monolith divided into local units simply for the sake of easier governance. The [[Orthodox]] synod's statement said that, with the international Catholic-Orthodox theological dialogue set to begin again in September with plans to deal with the "thorny problem" of papal primacy, it would have been better not to have removed the title without consultation.<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603382.htm Orthodox express concern about 'patriarch of the West' title]</ref>

A leading [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Muscovite Orthodox]] spokesman has said that a visit to [[Ukraine]] by Pope Benedict XVI would be "untimely", according to the country's RISU news service. "If Pope Benedict is a moral and a spiritual person and wants only good for Ukraine and its people, he will never take such an unreasonable step," said Valentyn Lukianyk, the head of the Union of Orthodox Brotherhoods of Ukraine. He was responding to the news that Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] has invited the Pope to visit the country. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] there have been numerous clashes between [[Orthodox]] and Catholic believers over the ownership of parish properties that were confiscated by the [[Communists]] and handed over to the Russian Orthodox Church. At the same time, Orthodox leaders have complained that Catholics are engaged in "proselytism", seeking converts among Orthodox believers. In his statement opposing a papal visit, Lukianyk said that relations between Catholics and Orthodox in Ukraine are now "warming." A visit by Pope Benedict, he said, would place an undue burden on those sensitive ties.<ref>[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=44743 Ukrainian Orthodox spokesman opposes papal visit]</ref>

[[Christodoulos|Archbishop Christodoulos]], Archbishop of Athens, visited Pope Benedict XVI at  the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]] on [[December 13]], [[2006]].  It was the first official visit by a Church of Greece leader to the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].  Archbishop Christodoulos was present for the funeral of Pope [[John Paul II]].  The [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Bartholomew I]], with other Orthodox prelates also were present for the funeral Mass, but did not participate liturgically.

====Protestants====
In 2005, Pope Benedict sent a message to the national synod of the [[Reformed Church of France]], the country<U+2019>s main Protestant community, who thanked the Pontiff for this <U+201C>gesture of consideration.<U+201D>  

In more general terms, Pope Benedict addressed Protestant churches in a speech during his trip to Cologne, Germany in 2005, discussing a "renewed sense of our brotherhood" and "a more open and trusting climate between Christians belonging to the various Churches and Ecclesial Communities."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050819_ecumenical-meeting_en.html APOSTOLIC JOURNEY TO COLOGNE ON THE OCCASION OF THE XX WORLD YOUTH DAY ECUMENICAL MEETING ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XVI]</ref>

According to [[John L. Allen, Jr.]]'s ''Cardinal Ratzinger'', the Pope, a German himself, feels a bond towards [[Lutherans]] and has Lutheran friends. Allen, in fact, compares the then Cardinal Ratzinger's feelings towards Lutherans to the feelings John Paul had for Orthodox Christians in that both men wanted a divided Christendom to be reunited. The Pope is said to be rather ambivalent towards [[Martin Luther]].

In Autumn 2006 Pope Benedict met with [[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and spiritual head of the [[Anglican Communion]].  They issued a Common Declaration, highlighting the previous 40 years of dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans while also acknowledging "serious obstacles to our ecumenical progress."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061123_common-decl_en.html COMMON DECLARATION OF POPE BENEDICT XVI AND THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HIS GRACE ROWAN WILLIAMS]</ref>  In January 2008, he also met with [[John Sentamu]], [[Archbishop of York]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jan/29/religion.catholicism|title=Sentamu stands the Pope a beer|first=Riazat|last=Butt|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=[[January 29]] [[2008]]|accessdate=2008-03-19}}</ref>

The June 2007 clarification of [[Dominus Iesus]], approved by the Pope, restated the Catholic Church's position that because of their lack of bishops in the historic episcopate, Protestant faith communities "are not true Churches," as contrasted with Orthodox communities, which have bishops in the apostolic line and are therefore are considered true, if deficient, Churches.<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=24660 Catholic Church alone is one, true church, says Vatican congregation]</ref><ref name="WINFIELD" /><ref name="Levada" />

Regarding the pope's comment, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Denmark issued the statement: "However, it has a destructive effect on ecumenical relations if one church deprives another church of the right to be called a church. It is just as destructive as if one Christian denies another Christian the right to be called a Christian."<ref>[http://www.interchurch.dk/dok/703dom-iesus-eng.htm Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark's reply to the Roman Catholic Church]</ref>

The Pope's claim that Protestant faith communities "are not true Churches", was described by [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Adventists]] as "nothing more than tradition".<ref>[http://news.adventist.org/data/2007/1184170928/index.html.en Adventists Call Catholic Claim Nothing More Than Tradition]</ref>

===Dialogue with other religions===

Pope Benedict is open to dialogue with other religious groups, and has sought to improve relations with them throughout his pontificate. He has, however, generated certain controversies in doing so.

====Judaism====
The [[World Jewish Congress]] "welcomed" {{Fact|date=November 2007}} his election to the pontificate, noted "his great sensitivity to the Jewish history and the [[Holocaust]]", and quoted the Pope in its press release:
:Even if the most recent, loathsome experience of the Shoah (Holocaust) was perpetrated in the name of an anti-Christian ideology, which tried to strike the Christian faith at its Abrahamic roots in the people of Israel, it cannot be denied that a certain insufficient resistance to this atrocity on the part of Christians can be explained by an inherited anti-Judaism present in the hearts of not a few Christians. 
However, Pope Benedict XVI's meeting with a Polish priest who has been accused of making anti-Jewish comments has shocked Jewish groups. The European Jewish Congress said that it was "shocked" in a letter to the Vatican.<ref>[http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1340881.php/Jewish_group_protests_popes_meeting_with_anti-Semitic_priest Jewish group protests pope's meeting with anti-Semitic priest]</ref> Benedict XVI has made two visits to synagogues to meet with their congregants, however. <ref>New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/us/nationalspecial2/19synagogue.html?ref=us]</ref><ref>The Vatican, [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050819_cologne-synagogue_en.html]</ref> This is notable because there had only been one known Papal visit to a synagogue before Benedict XVI's administration, and that was by his predecessor, [[John Paul II]].<ref>New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/us/nationalspecial2/18cnd-pope.html?hp]</ref><ref>New York Times, [http://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/14/international/europe/14POPE.html]</ref>

====Islam====
{{main|Pope Benedict XVI and Islam}}

Pope Benedict's relations with Islam have been at times strained. On [[12 September]] [[2006]] Pope Benedict XVI delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the [[University of Regensburg]] in [[Germany]]. The pope had previously served as professor of [[theology]] at the university, and his lecture was entitled "Faith, Reason and the University<U+2014>Memories and Reflections".
The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many [[Islamic world|Islamic politicians and religious leaders]] registered their protest against what they said was an insulting mischaracterization of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion. Muslims were particularly angry at<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm BBC Article.

According to the German text, the Pope's original comment was that the emperor "addresses his interlocutor in an astoundingly harsh <U+2014> to us surprisingly harsh <U+2014> way" ''(wendet er sich in erstaunlich schroffer, uns <U+00FC>berraschend schroffer Form).''<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20060912_university-regensburg_ge.html "Lecture of the Holy Father - Faith, Reason and the University Memories and Reflections"], ''Libreria Editrice Vaticana'', [[12 September]], [[2006]] {{de icon}}</ref> Pope Benedict apologised for any offence he had caused and made a point of visiting Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, and praying in its Blue Mosque.

====Tibetan Buddhism====

The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] congratulated Pope Benedict XVI upon his election,<ref>"[http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=9643&article=His+Holiness+the+Dalai+Lama+Greets+New+Pope His Holiness the Dalai Lama Greets New Pope]", Phayul.com, [[April 20]] [[2005]]; [http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200504/200504200016.html Korean Catholics Welcome New Pontiff]", English.chosun.com, [[April 20]] [[2005]]</ref> and visited him in October 2006 in the Vatican City.

While visiting [[Brazil]] in May 2007, "the pope sparked controversy by saying that native populations had been 'silently longing' for the Christian faith brought to [[South America]] by colonizers."<ref name="softenc">{{Cite news | last=Fisher| first=Ian| author-link=Ian Fisher| title=Pope softens comments on S.

{{Main|List of journeys of Pope Benedict XVI}}
[[Image:Popemobile May 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Pope Benedict XVI in a [[Mercedes-Benz]] popemobile in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]]]
Pope Benedict has not made as many pastoral trips outside the Vatican as his predecessor. Nevertheless, Benedict has visited nine countries to date: his homeland, [[Germany]], which he has visited twice, once for [[World Youth Day]] and once to visit the towns of his childhood. He has also visited [[Poland]] and [[Spain]], where he was enthusiastically received. His visit to [[Turkey]], an overwhelmingly [[Islam|Muslim]] nation two months after his visit to [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] was initially overshadowed by the [[Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy|controversy about a lecture he had given at Regensburg]]. His visit was met by nationalist and Islamic protesters<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/26/AR2006112600191.html "Turks Protest Pope's Coming Visit"]</ref> and was placed under unprecedented security measures.<ref>[http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/story.asp?j=202552106&p=zxz55z8yz IOL | Massive security for Pope's Turkey visit<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  However, the trip went ahead and Benedict made a joint declaration with [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I]] in an attempt to begin to heal the rift between the Catholic and Orthodox churches.

In 2007, Pope Benedict visited Brazil in order to address the Bishops' Conference there and canonise [[Frei Galv<U+00E3>o|Friar Ant<U+00F4>nio Galv<U+00E3>o]], an 18th century Franciscan.

The Pope also met privately with victims of sexual abuse by priests. On April 18, the pope addressed the [[General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] in [[New York City|New York]]. The following day, he presided over the first [[Papal Mass]] ever held in New York's [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]]. Later in the day he traveled to [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie]] in [[Yonkers, NY]] where he met with disabled children and their families and attended an event for Catholic youth, where he addressed the 25,000 young people in attendance.<ref>[http://washingtontimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080420/NATION/168699792/1001 Duin, Julia.

===Attire===
[[Image:BentoXVI-29-10052007.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI in [[choir dress]] with the red summer [[papal mozzetta]], embroidered red [[stole]], and the red [[papal shoes]].]]
Pope Benedict XVI has re-introduced several [[papal garments]] which had previously fallen into disuse. Pope Benedict XVI resumed the use of the traditional red [[papal shoes]], which had not been used since early in the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house [[Prada]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the shoes were provided by the pope's personal [[shoemaker|cobbler]].<ref name="WSJ">[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114591920439834611-OtBN7F_qbGxt2YstGeEXX1WoMzQ_20060524.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top ''Does The Pope Wear Prada?''] April 25, 2006 in the [[Wall Street Journal]]. Accessed January 19, 2007</ref><!-- papal taylor: [[Ditta Annibale Gammarelli]]--> 

On [[December 21]], [[2005]], the pope began wearing the [[camauro]], the traditional red papal hat usually worn in the winter. It had not been seen since the pontificate of [[Pope John XXIII]] (1958<U+2013>1963). On [[September 6]], [[2006]] the pope began wearing the red [[cappello romano]] (also called a saturno), a wide-brimmed hat for outdoor use. Rarely used by [[John Paul II]], it was more widely worn by his predecessors.

Pope Benedict XVI has also restored the use of all three forms of the [[papal mozzetta]]. While only the red satin summer mozzetta was used by John Paul II, Benedict XVI has also made use of the winter papal mozzetta and the paschal mozzetta, both of which were last worn by [[Pope Paul VI]] The winter papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with white ermine, and the paschal mozzetta, worn only during the [[Eastertide]], is of white damask silk trimmed with white ermine. 

During his installment address, Pope Benedict XVI spoke at length about the significance of the [[pallium]], and he has returned to an ancient version of the vestment, an Eastern design, used by the popes of the first millennium. Benedict XVI has also returned to wearing traditional forms of other liturgical [[vestments]] to emphasize the continuity of the papacy and the church.<ref>[http://thenewliturgicalmovement.blogspot.com/2007/12/benedict-xvi-liturgical-pope.html Tribe, Shawn. "Benedict XVI: The Liturgical Pope?". ''The New Liturgical Movement''. 20 Dec 2007]</ref>

One item that Benedict has not worn to date is the [[papal tiara]]. Like his two immediate predecessors, Benedict chose not to be crowned with the tiara during his Inauguration Mass, nor has he worn it since that time. Unlike them, however, he has emphasized this decision by breaking with prior tradition in using a [[mitre]] instead of the tiara in his coat of arms. Other traditional [[pontifical vestments]] remain unused as well, including the [[fanon]], the [[pontifical gloves]], and the [[papal slippers]].

[[Franco Zeffirelli]], the famed Italian film director of numerous lavish productions, criticized the Pontiff's vestments as being too "showy."  He said that, "These are not times of high-tailored church wear."  Zeffirelli believes that Pope Benedict's garments are "too sumptuous" and make the pontiff appear cold and removed from his surroundings.<ref>[http://www.examiner.com/a-1106916~Zeffirelli__Pope_Benedict_Needs_Makeover.html?cid=sec-promo ''Zeffirelli: Pope Benedict Needs Makeover''] December 15, 2007 in the [[Cleveland Examiner]]. Accessed December 27, 2007.</ref> The Vatican explained Benedict's use of traditional vestments such as older, much taller miters during his "[[Urbi et Orbi]]" Christmas greeting by pointing to the need "to underline the continuity of today's liturgical celebration with that which characterized the life of the church in the past."  The Pope's liturgist likened the use of vestments worn by previous popes to annotations in papal documents, where "a pope cites the pontiffs who preceded him in order to indicate the continuity of the church's magisterium."<ref>[http://www.examiner.com/a-1106916~Zeffirelli__Pope_Benedict_Needs_Makeover.html?cid=sec-promo ''Papal use of old vestments connects with past, Vatican liturgist says''] December 26, 2007 in [[Catholic News Service]]. Accessed December 27, 2007.</ref><br />

==Titles==
The official title of the Pope is '''His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI'''; in Latin, '''Benedictus XVI''', '''Episcopus Romae'''. However, his rarely-used full title is "His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI, [[Bishop of Rome]], Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, [[Supreme Pontiff]] of the Universal Church, [[Primate (religion)|Primate]] of Italy, [[Archbishop]] and [[metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the Roman province, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City, [[Servant of the Servants of God]]."

Before [[1 March]] [[2006]], the list of titles also used to contain that of a "[[Patriarch]] of the West", which traditionally appeared in that list of titles before "Primate of Italy." The title of "Patriarch of the West" was first adopted in the year 642 by [[Pope Theodore I]], but was rarely used since the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054. From the Orthodox perspective, authority in the Church could be traced to the five patriarchates of Rome, [[Constantinople]], [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], and [[Jerusalem]]. However, some Catholic theologians have argued that the term "Patriarch of the West" has no clear historical or theological basis and was introduced into papal court in 1870, at the time of the [[First Vatican Council]]. Pope Benedict chose to remove the title at a time when discussions with the Orthodox churches have centered on the issue of papal primacy. It has also been suggested that "the West" is a misnomer as the modern [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]] is today global in its extent. [[Pope John Paul II]] reportedly considered dropping the title during his own pontificate.

==Political positions==
===Turkey===
{{main|Accession of Turkey to the European Union}}
In an 2004 ''[[Le Figaro]]'', Ratzinger said that [[Turkey]], which is demographically [[Muslim]] but governmentally [[Secularism|secular]] by virtue of its state constitution (see [[Secularism in Turkey]]), should seek its future in an association of [[Muslim world|Muslim nations]] rather than the [[European Union]], which Ratzinger has stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been "in permanent contrast to [[Europe]]" and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake.<ref>Jim Bencivenga, "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0422/dailyUpdate.html Navigating a clash of civilizations: Examining the new pope's old comments on Turkey's entry into the European Union]," ''Christian Science Monitor''. 22 April 2005.</ref>

Later visiting the country to "reiterate the solidarity between the cultures," it was reported that he made a counter-statement backing Turkey's bid to join the EU. [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdo<U+011F>an]], after meeting the pope upon his arrival in [[Ankara]], the pope's first visit to a majority Muslim country, said that the pope told him that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires Turkey's membership in the EU.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&refer=europe Pope Benedict Backs Turkey's European Union Bid]</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6192770.stm Pope calls for religious exchange]</ref> However, the Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] implied that support for Turkey's membership in the European Union would be contingent on the establishment of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] in Turkey:<ref>[http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idcategory=34&idSub=160&idArticle=6852 "Pope did not change stance on Turkey and EU"], ''Spero News'', 30 November 2006</ref> "In every step towards unification, minorities must be protected, with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion."<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061130_dichiarazione-comune_en.html "Common Declaration by His Holiness Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I"], 30 November 2006</ref> The Declaration also reiterates Pope Benedict XVI's call for Europe to preserve its Christian roots.

===Birth control and HIV/AIDS===
It was widely reported in April 2006 that the Vatican had launched a commission to investigate and prepare a document regarding the question of whether there are any cases when a married person may use condoms to protect against infection from their spouse. Though no conclusions have yet been reached, the investigation has surprised many Catholics in the wake of [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II's]] consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to [[AIDS]] and the widespread belief that his successor shared this view.<ref>[http://www.breakingnews.ie/2006/04/24/story255648.html Protection against AIDS]</ref> In November 2005 the Pope had listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts with no mention of condoms. However, Time Magazine reported in its [[April 30]] [[2006]] edition that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials "flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use."<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060508-1189193,00.html Time article "Condom Fight: The Vatican Strikes Back"]</ref>

===Korea===
On November 13, 2006, Benedict said the dispute over the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea nuclear weapons program]] should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. "The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearization of the [[Korean Peninsula]]." Benedict said in a speech to the new Japanese ambassador to Vatican.<ref>[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20061113/410100000020061113220217E1.html Pope urges talks to make Korean Peninsula nuclear free]</ref>

In a message released November 14, 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of World Day for Migrants and Refugees, the pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, [[exile]]s, [[Emergency evacuation|evacuees]], and [[internally displaced person]]s. "The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families," the pope said. "Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done."<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001 Pope Benedict XVI message for 93rd World Day of Migrants and Refugees]</ref>

Pope Benedict has also promoted various [[UN]] events, such as [[World Refugee Day]], on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees' human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help.<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603503.htm Pope offers prayers to refugees for United Nations' World Refugee Day]</ref>

===China===
{{main|Roman Catholicism in China}}
On June 28, 2006, for the first time in more than five years, an official Vatican delegation visited [[China]] and met with government officials, signaling a warming between the two nations that had previously been locked in conflict. "This is a real gesture by the Vatican and its diplomats," said the Reverend Bernardo Cervellera, director of AsiaNews, a Catholic missionary news service with close links to the Vatican. In sending diplomats to [[Beijing]], the Vatican, under Pope Benedict XVI, is publicly expressing interest in improving relations with China despite the recent conflicts.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/06/28/news/vat.php Beijing receives Vatican delegation, signaling a thaw]</ref>

In 2007 Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the church's relationship with China's leadership. The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the Patriotic Association and the Communist government.<ref name="Letter">[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070527_china_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to Chinese Catholics, May 27, 2007]</ref>
