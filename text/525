==Early life in Poland==

In 1930, he tied for 6th-7th at the Warsaw Championship, an event won by [[Paulino Frydman]]. In 1931, he took second in Warsaw, behind Frydman. In 1932, he tied for 9th-10th in Warsaw.

Najdorf represented Poland in four pre-war [[Chess Olympiads]]. In August 1935, he played third board in the [[6th Chess Olympiad]] in Warsaw (+9 <U+2013>2 =6). In August 1936, he was second board in [[3rd unofficial Chess Olympiad]] organised by the German Chess Federation in [[Munich]] (+14 <U+2013>2 =4). In June/July 1937, he played at second board in the [[7th Chess Olympiad]] in [[Stockholm]] (+5 <U+2013>3 =7).<ref>[http://www.olimpbase.org/players/c6mc60wj.html OlimpBase :: Men's Chess Olympiads :: Miguel Najdorf]</ref>

==Move to Argentina==
In August/September 1939, the outbreak of World War II found him in [[Buenos Aires]], where he was playing the [[8th Chess Olympiad]], representing Poland at second board. Najdorf was of Jewish origin (as were two of his team-mates, Tartakower and Frydman. He decided to stay in [[Argentina]] (as did many players, both Jew and [[Gentile]]), suffering considerable personal and familial loss as a result, but escaping the [[Holocaust]]. He achieved a score of (+12 <U+2212>2 =4).

In September 1939, after the 8th Olympiad, Najdorf tied for first with [[Paul Keres]] at Buenos Aires (Circulo); the two scored 8.5/11. In 1941, he took second, after [[Gideon St<U+00E5>hlberg]] at [[Mar del Plata chess tournaments|Mar del Plata]], with 12.5/17. Later in 1941, he finished equal first with Stahlberg at Buenos Aires, the two scoring 11/14. In 1942, he won at Mar del Plata, with 13.5/17, ahead of St<U+00E5>hlberg. In 1943, he was second at Mar del Plata, behind St<U+00E5>lhberg, scoring 10/13. In 1943, he won at [[Rosario]]. In 1944, he won at [[La Plata]], with 13/16, ahead of St<U+00E5>hlberg. In 1944, he tied for first with [[Herman Pilnik]] at Mar del Plata, with each scoring 12/15. In 1945, he won at Buenos Aires ([[Roberto Grau]] Memorial), with 10/12, ahead of St<U+00E5>hlberg and [[Carlos Guimard]]. He took second place at [[Vi<U+00F1>a del Mar]] 1945, with 10.5/13, behind Guimard, then won Mar del Plata 1945 with 11/15, ahead of St<U+00E5>hlberg, and repeated at Mar del Plata 1946 with 16/18, ahead of Guimard and St<U+00E5>hlberg. He also won at [[Rio de Janeiro]] 1946.<ref>[http://www.brasilbase.pro.br BrasilBase]</ref> 

After World War II ended, organized chess resumed in the international arena, particularly in war-stricken Europe. In 1946, Najdorf tied for 4th-5th with [[L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Szab<U+00F3> (chess player)|L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Szab<U+00F3>]] at [[Groningen 1946 chess tournament|Groningen]], with 11.5/19; the event was won by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]. He then won at [[Prague]], with (+9 -1 =3), ahead of [[Petar Trifunovi<U+0107>]], [[Gosta Stoltz]], [[Svetozar Gligori<U+0107>]], and [[Jan Foltys]]. He also won at [[Barcelona]] 1946, with 11.5/13, ahead of [[Daniel Yanofsky]]. In 1947, he took second place at Buenos Aires/La Plata (Sextangular), with 6.5/10, behind St<U+00E5>hlberg, but ahead of [[Max Euwe]]. In 1947, he won at Mar del Plata. In 1947, he finished second, after [[Erich Eliskases]], at [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]].

In 1948, Najdorf placed second at [[New York]] with 6/9, two points behind [[Reuben Fine]]. He tied for 4th-5th with [[Hector Rossetto]] at Mar del Plata, with 10/17, behind Eliskases, St<U+00E5>hlberg, and Medina Garcia. Najdorf won at Mar del Plata 1948 with 14/17, ahead of St<U+00E5>hlberg (13.5), Eliskases (12), and Euwe (10.5). He was second at Buenos Aires 1948, with 8/10, behind St<U+00E5>hlberg. Najdorf won at [[Venice]] 1948, with 11.5/13, ahead of [[Gideon Barcza]], Esteban Canal, and Euwe. In 1949, he tied for first with St<U+00E5>hlberg at Buenos Aires. In 1950, he won at [[Amsterdam]], with 15/19, ahead of [[Samuel Reshevsky]] (14), St<U+00E5>hlberg (13.5), Gligori<U+0107> (12), [[Vasja Pirc]] (12), and Euwe (11.5). He also won at Bled in 1950.<ref>[http://www.rogerpaige.me.uk Roger Paige Chess Site]</ref>

==Olympiad performances==
He played eleven times for Argentina in Chess Olympiads from 1950 to 1976. He played first board in the [[9th Chess Olympiad]] at [[Dubrovnik]] 1950 (+8 <U+2013>0 =6), as well as at [[Helsinki]] 1952 (+11 <U+2013>2 =3), [[Amsterdam]] 1954, [[Moscow]] 1956, [[Leipzig]] 1960, [[Varna]] 1962, [[Havana]] 1966, [[Lugano]] 1968, [[Siegen]] 1970, and [[Haifa]] 1976. Only during the Olympiad at [[Nice]] 1974, he played on third board.
 
Najdorf took eleven Olympic medals (seven for teams Poland and Argentina <U+2013> four silver, three bronze, and four individuals <U+2013> gold in 1939, 1950, and 1952, as well as one silver in 1962).

==World Championship contender==
Najdorf's string of successes from 1939 to 1947 had raised him into the ranks of the world's top players. According to [[Chessmetrics]], he was ranked second in the world from mid 1947 to mid 1949.<ref>[http://db.chessmetrics.com/CM2/Summary.asp?Params=194510SSSSS3S000000000000111000000000000010100 Chessmetrics Summary for  1945 - 1955], [[Chessmetrics]]</ref> Despite his strong results, Najdorf was not invited to the [[World Chess Championship 1948|1948 World Championship tournament]] as a replacement for Fine.

Although not a full-time chess professional (for many years he worked in the [[insurance]] business), he was one of the world's leading chess players in the 1950s and 1960s and he excelled in playing [[blindfold chess]]. In 1950, [[FIDE]] made him one of the inaugural [[International Grandmaster]]s. In the same year he played at [[Budapest]] in the [[Candidates Tournament]] to select a challenger for the [[world chess championship]], and finished fifth. Three years later, in the [[Z<U+00FC>rich]] Candidates Tournament in 1953, he finished sixth, and never succeeded in qualifying for the Candidates again. The closest he would come in the remainder of his career was in the following cycle, when he narrowly failed to qualify from the 1955 [[Interzonal]], held at [[Gothenburg]], [[Sweden]].<ref>[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/5557$iix.htm 1955 Goteborg Interzonal Tournament], Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref>

==Later career==
Najdorf won important tournaments such as [[Mar del Plata chess tournaments|Mar del Plata]] (1961) and [[Havana]] (1962 and 1964). He also played in both [[Piatigorsky Cup]] tournaments, held in 1963 and 1966. Just before his 60th birthday, he participated in the 1970 [[Russia (USSR) vs Rest of the World|USSR vs. Rest of the World]] match, achieving an even score against the former world champion [[Mikhail Tal]].  

Najdorf's lively personality made him a great favorite among chess fans, as he displayed an aptitude for witty sayings, in the manner of his mentor Tartakower. An example: commenting on his opponent at the 1970 USSR-vs-World match, he remarked, "When [then-world-champion Boris] [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]] offers you a piece, you might as well resign then and there. But when Tal offers you a piece, you would do well to keep playing, because then he might offer you another, and then another, and then ... who knows?"

Najdorf remained active in chess to the end of his life. At age 69, he tied for second place in a very strong field at [[Buenos Aires]] 1979, with 8/13, behind winner [[Bent Larsen]] (11/13), though ahead of former world champions [[Tigran Petrosian]] and [[Boris Spassky]]. At Buenos Aires 1988, he made a score of 8.5/15 for fourth place at age 78. The next year in the 1989 [[Argentine Chess Championship|Argentine Championship]], with several other GMs in the field, he tied for 4th-6th places, with 10/17. His last national championship was in 1991 at age 81, where he finished with a minus score. Najdorf was an exceptional blitz (five-minute) player, remaining a strong player into his eighties.

Najdorf's enthusiasm for, and virtuosity in conducting, the attack against the enemy King is well shown here, in a game praised by [[David Bronstein]] in his famous book on the tournament. It is also a good example of learning from one's defeats.  Earlier that year, Gligori<U+0107> had beaten Najdorf with the same system. ([http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1101261, Miguel Najdorf vs Svetozar Gligoric, Mar del Plata 1953]).
