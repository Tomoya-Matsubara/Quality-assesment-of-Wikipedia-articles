'''USS ''Gazelle'' (1863)''' was a side-wheel steamer acquired by the [[Union Navy]] for duty with the [[Mississippi River Squadron]]. She was the first ship to be named ''Gazelle'' by the Navy after being purchased at [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], [[21 November]] [[1863]], as the ''Emma Brown''. She was commissioned February [[1864]] at [[Cairo, Illinois]]., with Acting Master Charles Thatcher in command.

== Civil War operations ==
 
''Gazelle'' reached the mouth of the [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] in time to join Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]]<U+2019>s joint Army-Navy expedition of [[12 March]]-[[22 May]] [[1864]]. The operation was part of the campaign against [[Texas]] designed to gain a strong foothold there and to thwart the [[France|French]] intervention in [[Mexico]]. 

Serving between the mouth of the Red River and [[Grand Ecore]], [[Louisiana]], ''Gazelle'' engaged enemy shore units, convoyed [[Union Army]] transports, and patrolled the river while Union Navy [[gunboats]] assisted in the capture of [[Fort De Russy]]. 

For the next year the ship patrolled between the mouth of the Red River and [[Morganza, Louisiana]], and convoyed transports. On [[24 May]] [[1865]] she embarked Confederate Generals [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.]], and [[Sterling Price]] at the mouth of the Red River and brought them to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], to negotiate a surrender with General [[Edward Canby]]. Subsequently, following repairs at [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], ''Gazelle'' steamed upriver to [[Mound City, Illinois]]., arriving [[25 June]].

== Decommissioning ==

She decommissioned there [[7 July]] [[1865]]; she was sold [[17 August]] [[1865]] to Henry Scott et al. She was redocumented as ''Plain City'' [[23 October]] and operated until abandoned in [[1869]].
