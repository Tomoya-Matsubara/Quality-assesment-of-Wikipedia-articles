The '''[[Portugal|Portuguese]] national football team''' is governed by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] (FPF), finishing 4th at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. The first  appearance in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] saw them reach the  semifinal, losing 2<U+2013>1 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] to the eventual world champions [[England national football team|England]]. Portugal finished in third place and [[Eus<U+00E9>bio]] was considered the best player of the tournament. The next two times Portugal qualified for the World Cup were [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], with Portugal going out in the first round both times. In the 1986 tournament, players [[Saltillo Affair|went on strike]] over prize-money and refused to train between their first and second games. 

In 2003, the Portuguese Football Federation decided to hire [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], the [[Brazil]]ian who had led the [[Brazil national football team]] to win the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. Scolari led Portugal to the final of [[UEFA Euro 2004]], where they lost to the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]], and to their second World Cup semi-final in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. Scolari left after the Euro 2008 championships to manage [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Carlos Queiroz was appointed the new manager of Portugal in 2008.

==History==
===Early years===
The Portuguese Football Federation was formed in 1914 with the name '''Uni<U+00E3>o Portuguesa de Futebol''' (by 1926, they changed to its current name) and the aim of creating national tournaments (since it only existed regional championships) and promoting games in which a Portuguese representative team would play against other teams from various parts of the globe, but unfortunately, due to the [[World War I]], the dream was not made possible for the next seven years.

Portugal<U+2019>s first game was on the 18th December 1921 against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], the game ended in a defeat for the national team (3<U+2013>1). The following year, the inaugural edition of the [[Ta<U+00E7>a de Portugal|Campeonato de Portugal]] (a knock-out tournament, precursor of the <U+2019><U+2019>[[Ta<U+00E7>a de Portugal]]<U+2019><U+2019>) was contested, the winner was defined as the <U+201C>Portuguese Champion<U+201D>.

===1928 Olympic Tournament===
After years of playing friendly games, Portugal was invited to enter the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics Football Tournament]], which was, at that time, contested by the best national "A" teams in the world and, therefore, considered to be the best international footballing tournament until the [[FIFA World Cup]] started, two years later, in 1930.

The Portuguese team was drawn in the preliminary round against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] for a place in the first round. After falling 2<U+2013>0 behind, Portugal scored four goals, winning the game 4<U+2013>2 in what was their first win away from home soil. After their fantastic win against Chile, they faced off [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and won 2<U+2013>1 thanks to a late goal in the 90th minute.

[[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] was the team that followed in the quarter finals. Here the Portuguese adventure ended after a 2<U+2013>1 defeat. In the following games, the Egyptians lost against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (6<U+2013>0) in the semi-final and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (11<U+2013>3) for the bronze medal match, which bittered the players. Nevertheless, it was a bright start in international tournaments for the team.

===Early World Cup attempts===
Portugal was not invited to the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]], which only featured a final stage and no [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification round]]. The team took part in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 2|1934 FIFA World Cup qualification]], but failed to eliminate their Spanish opponents, aggregating two defeats in the two-legged round, first  (9<U+2013>0) in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] and 2<U+2013>1 in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] in the second game for a total of 11<U+2013>1.

In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 2/Group 3/Group 5)#Group 5|1938 qualification]], the ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o'' played one game against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in a neutral ground, held in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], losing 2<U+2013>1 against the Swiss, ending with the qualification prospects.

Because of the international conflict due to the [[World War II]], there was no [[FIFA World Cup]] held until the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 competition]] and subsequently, the national team made very few games against other teams. A 10<U+2013>0 away friendly defeat against [[England national football team|England]], two years after the War, was the proof of how the irregularity of the games had taken its effects on the squad, this result still stands as their biggest ever defeat.

===1950s and early 1960s===
On the restart of the tournament, the Portuguese team [[1950 FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 6|was to play]] a two-legged round against Spain, just like in the 1934 qualification. After a 5<U+2013>1 defeat in Madrid, they managed to draw in the second game 2<U+2013>2 and so the qualification ended with a 7<U+2013>3 aggregate score.

For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 5/Group 6/Group 9)#Group 5|qualification of the 1954 World Cup]], the team would play [[Austria]]. The Austrians won the first game with a humiliating 9<U+2013>1 result. The best the national team could do was held the Central European team to a goalless draw in [[Lisbon]] and the round ended with a 9<U+2013>1 defeat.

In the [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 8)|1958 qualification]], Portugal finished last in the group stage that also featured [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and Italy, only the first-placed team would qualify. They started with a draw (1<U+2013>1) against the Irish team, but lost in Belfast by 3<U+2013>0. After that, they won 3<U+2013>0 against Italy and lost 3<U+2013>0 in Milan. Finishing with three points, the were two away from group winners Northern Ireland.

The year 1960 was the year that UEFA created the [[European Football Championship]], a football tournament similar to the FIFA World Cup, but for European nations. The [[Euro 1960|first edition]] was a knock-out tournament, the last four teams participating in final stage that only featured one leg while the older stages had two legs. For the first round, the ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o das Quinas'' won 2<U+2013>0 against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] and 3<U+2013>2 in [[Porto]] for the second leg, finishing with a 5<U+2013>2 two-legged win. The quarter-final opponent was Yugoslavia. Despite winning the first game 2<U+2013>1, they lost the second leg 5<U+2013>1 in [[Belgrade]], and lost 6<U+2013>3 on aggregate.

England and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] were the [[1962 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 6)|1962 FIFA World Cup qualification]] adversaries of the national team. Portugal ended second in the group with three points, behind England (with seven points). They started well with a home win (6<U+2013>0) against Luxembourg and a home draw (1<U+2013>1) against the British nation, but lost the following games, first (4<U+2013>2) against Luxembourg and second (2<U+2013>0) against England. Like in the previous World Cup qualification, only the first in the group would qualify.

The [[Euro 1964|1964 European Championship]] shared the same format as the 1964 edition. Portugal played against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] in the first round. The Portuguese lost 3<U+2013>1 in Sofia and won 3<U+2013>1 in Lisbon. With the round tied 4<U+2013>4, a replay was needed in a neutral ground. In [[Rome]], Portugal lost 1<U+2013>0 with a late goal from the Bulgarians.

In 1964, the [[Ta<U+00E7>a das Na<U+00E7><U+00F5>es|Nations' Cup]] was held in [[Brazil]]. The event celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Brazilian Football Confederation. Three international teams were invited: Argentina, Portugal, and England, for the competition which was played in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] during late May and early June with an all [[round-robin]] format. Portugal ended with one point (five behind winners Argentina) and joint third place with England after two defeats (4<U+2013>1 with Brazil and 2<U+2013>0 with Argentina) and a 1<U+2013>1 tie against the British team.

===1966 World Cup and 1970s===
In the [[1966 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA - Group 4)|1966 World Cup qualification]], Portugal was drawn into the same group as [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. They topped the group with only one draw and one defeat during all the six games and finally qualified for a FIFA World Cup, that year the final stage would be held in [[England]]. Notable results were both 1<U+2013>0 away wins against Czechoslovakia and Turkey and a 5<U+2013>1 home win against the Turks.

The team started out with three wins in the group stage where they were in Group C when they beat [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 3<U+2013>1, Bulgaria 3<U+2013>0, and two-time defending champions [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 3<U+2013>1. Secondly, they beat surprise quarter-finalist [[Korea DPR national football team|North Korea]] 5<U+2013>3, with [[Eus<U+00E9>bio]] getting four markers to overturn a 3<U+2013>0 deficit. Later, they reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by hosts England 2<U+2013>1; in this game, Portugal would have played in [[Liverpool]], but as England were the hosts, FIFA decided that the game should have been in [[London]], which led the Portuguese team travel unexpectedly from Liverpool to London. Portugal then defeated the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] 2<U+2013>1 in the third place match for their best World Cup finish to date. Eus<U+00E9>bio was the top scorer of the World Cup with nine goals.

For the [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying#Group 2|Euro 1968 qualifying]], the ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o'' played against Bulgaria, [[Norway national football team|Norway]], and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. They finished second after Bulgaria, with six points, four behind the first. Portugal only managed to get two wins and two ties; both wins came from 2<U+2013>1 results against Norway.

After their tremendous success in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, Portugal [[FIFA World Cup qualification#Group 1|tried to qualify]] for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]], which was to be held in [[Mexico]]. They finished fourth and last in their group, behind [[Greece national football team|Greece]], Romania and Switzerland. With only four points (from one win and two ties), Portugal were four behind group winner<U+2019>s Romania.

To be able to participate in [[UEFA Euro 1972]], Portugal had to win its [[UEFA Euro 1972 qualifying#Group 5|group that comprised]] the teams of [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. Portugal finished second to Belgium with seven points (two less than the Belgians). The three wins the Portuguese had were against Denmark (1<U+2013>0 away, 5<U+2013>0 home) and Scotland in a 2<U+2013>0 home win.

Also in the year 1972, Portugal participated in the [[Brazilian Independence Cup]], a tournament that marked the 150th birthday since [[Brazil]] got its independence from Portugal. Winning both group stages (in the first stage, with wins against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3<U+2013>0), [[Iran national football team|Iran]] (3<U+2013>0), Chile (4<U+2013>1) and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] (2<U+2013>1) and in the second stage winning against Argentina (3<U+2013>1), drawing [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] (1<U+2013>1) and a 2<U+2013>1 win over the Soviet Union) they qualified for the final with Brazil in the [[Maracan<U+00E3> Stadium]]. The Brazilian star [[Jairzinho]] scored in the 89th minute to give Brazil the win.

[[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 6|Along with]] Bulgaria, [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], and Northern Ireland, Portugal faced tough competition on winning the spot that would ensure them a place in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Argentina]]. They finished second place bellow Bulgaria, with seven points (three away from the Bulgarians). The only country Portugal managed to defeat was Cyprus, winning 4<U+2013>0 and 1<U+2013>0 in [[Nicosia]].

===1980s and early 1990s===
[[UEFA Euro 1980 qualifying Group 2|The national team was put]] alongside Austria, Belgium, Norway, and Scotland to fight for the first spot in the group, which would allow them to go to the final stage of [[UEFA Euro 1980]]. With nine points, Portugal took third place with nine points, three points behind first-placed Belgium. Out of their four wins, the most important were the away win against second-placed Austria (2<U+2013>1) and a home win against Scotland (1<U+2013>0).

For the [[1982 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)# UEFA Group 6|1982 qualification]] the Portuguese team had to face [[Israel national football team|Israel]], Northern Ireland, Scotland and Sweden for the top two group places. Portugal finished in fourth place with seven points, less four than the first, with wins over group winners Scotland (2<U+2013>1), second-placed Northern Ireland (1<U+2013>0) and last-placed Israel (3<U+2013>0), all in home ground.

During [[UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying#Group 2|the campaign for Euro 1984]], Portugal  had to play with [[Finland national football team|Finland]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and, highly favourites, Soviet Union. Portugal won the group with a dramatic win over USSR in the last game by a score of 1<U+2013>0 in home ground. With ten points and five wins, the Portuguese had beaten the Soviet Union by one point.

Portugal ended in group B, alongside Spain, West Germany and Romania. In the first two games, they tied 0<U+2013>0 and 1<U+2013>1 against [[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] and Spain, respectively. A 1<U+2013>0 win over Romania gave them second place in the group, which was enough to go through to the knockout stage. [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s [[Tamagnini Nen<U+00E9>]] scored the winner.

They played against the hosts, [[France national football team|France]], and eventual champions, in one of the most exciting matches in European Championship history. France scored first, but Portugal equalised almost an hour later. The game was tied after 90 minutes and went into extra time. Portugal made the score 2<U+2013>1 in the first 15 minutes, with both teams having numerous quality scoring chances. In the second half of extra time, France scored in the 114th and 119th minutes to eliminate Portugal 3<U+2013>2 and go through to the final.

[[1986 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 2|For the 1986 tournament]], the ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o'' played against Czechoslovakia, [[Malta national football team|Malta]], Sweden, and West Germany for the two spots that would guarantee them a ticket to Mexico. Needing a win in the last game against West Germany in [[Stuttgart]], manager [[Jos<U+00E9> Augusto Torres|Jos<U+00E9> Torres]] famously said to the press, after being severally doubted that his team would qualify for Mexico 1986, "Let me dream!" Portugal went on to win the game 1<U+2013>0 to become the first team to beat West Germany at their home ground in an official match.

Portugal was a fan-favourite to make a good campaign because of their [[UEFA Euro 1984]] tournament. The team exited early in the group stages after a win and two losses. They started with a 1<U+2013>0 win to England. Later, they were beaten by Poland and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], 1<U+2013>0 and 3<U+2013>1, respectively. Their staying in Mexico was marked by a doping case, an injured player and, most significantly, by the [[Saltillo affair]], where players refused to train in order to win more prizes from the Football Federation.

Wanting to keep present at the major international football tournaments, the Portuguese team attempted to top their [[UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying#Group 2|qualifying group]] in a tight group with favourites Italy, Malta, Sweden and Switzerland. Still, they only managed to win two games in a total of eight disputed, ending in third with eight points, five behind first-placed Italy. Both games were won away from home, in [[Malta]] (1<U+2013>0) and in Sweden against second-placed team (also 1<U+2013>0).

The [[1990 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 7|1990 World Cup qualification]] was widely seen as a possibility to go back to the international stage. Along with Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Luxembourg and Switzerland, Portugal fought until the last game to get one of the first two spots of the group. Playing at home against Czechoslovakia, they failed to score and the game ended in a 0-0 allowing the East Europeans to get the second place with twelve points (the same as winner's Belgium) with two points ahead of Portugal, who came with the first place. Notable results are the wins against Switzerland, 3<U+2013>1 in Portugal and 2<U+2013>1 in [[Neuchatel]].

During the draws for the [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 6|Euro 1992 qualifying]], [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] was seen as the strongest team besides Portugal. Greece, Finland and Malta were the other teams. With five wins and eleven points, the Portuguese ended second behind the Dutch, who had two more points than Portugal. A famous result in this campaign was the 1<U+2013>0 home win against the Dutch.

They participated in the friendly [[1992 U.S. Cup]] along with the host, USA, Italy and Ireland in a round robin tournament. Portugal finished last with one point (six behind winners United States) from a draw with Italy (0<U+2013>0). The other two games were defeats with USA (1<U+2013>0) and the Republic of Ireland (2<U+2013>0).

For the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 1|<U+2019>94 World Cup qualification]], Portugal played in the same group as [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Italy, Malta, Scotland and Switzerland for the two highest places. They disappointed, ending in third with fourteen points and six wins, just two points behind winner<U+2019>s Italy and one behind second-placed Switzerland. In the last game of the round, Portugal were defeated by Italy in Milan. The ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o'' managed to win 1<U+2013>0 against Switzerland and 5<U+2013>0 against the Scots, both were home wins. The then manager, [[Carlos Queiroz]], blamed the Football Federation for this failure, saying that "They should clean the mess that the Federation has."

=== Golden generation===
[[File:Magalhaes Pessoa.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] playing [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] on 19 November 2003 at [[Est<U+00E1>dio Dr. Magalh<U+00E3>es Pessoa]]. Portugal beat Kuwait 8-0 which stands as a record for Portugal as there highest ever win in international football.]]
Portugal was invited to play at the [[SkyDome Cup]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] against the then-European Champions Denmark and [[Canada national football team|Canada]]. With a draw against the Canadians (1<U+2013>1) and a win against the Danes, Portugal went to win the trophy, which remains to date as their only win at senior level.

[[UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying#Group6|Portugal managed to reach]] the Euro 1996, by topping their group with twenty-three points, six more than second-placed Republic of Ireland. Their group consisted of [[Austria national football team|Austria]], [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]], Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. In the qualification, Portugal trashed Liechtenstein 8<U+2013>0 (home, a record) and 7<U+2013>0 (away) and defeated Northern Ireland 2<U+2013>1 in away grounds.

In the final tournament, Portugal drew 1<U+2013>1 with European Champions Denmark, won 1<U+2013>0 to Turkey and 3<U+2013>0 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], finishing first in their group. In the quarter-finals, they lost 1<U+2013>0 to eventual runners-up [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], due to a marvelous [[Karel Poborsk<U+00FD>]] second-half lob over goalkeeper [[V<U+00ED>tor Ba<U+00ED>a]]. This marked the beginning ot the [[Golden Generation]], a group of youngsters who had won the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]] an [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991]] and were now leading the national senior squad.

The team [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)#Group 9|almost qualified for the tournament]] that was to be hosted by [[France]]. However, during a qualifier in [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Rui Costa]] was controversially sent off for taking too long to walk off the field while Portugal was leading 1<U+2013>0. Germany drew the crucial game and was thus able to qualify. This incident is regarded as one of the darkest in Portugal's football history, with FIFA being accused of favouritism in support of Germany, who were the defending Euro '96 champions. The group was made of [[Albania national football team|Albania]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], Germany, Northern Ireland and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], Portugal ended in third place with 19 points and six wins. Germany finished first with 22 points and Ukraine with twenty, with the Slavics winning a place in the final play-offs. Portugal tied both games with Germany (0<U+2013>0 home and 1<U+2013>1 away).

In the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying#Group 7|qualifications for the 2000 Euro]], Portugal faced [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]], Hungary, Liechtenstein, Romania and [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. Portugal gained twenty-three points, just one short of first place Romania, with seven wins. Having not qualified directly into the event, the Portuguese team had the best performance by any runner-up and therefore qualified for the final tournament. Major wins against Azerbaijan (7<U+2013>0) and Liechtenstein (8<U+2013>0) are the most remembered today.

Captained by [[Fernando Couto]] in the [[Euro 2000|final stage]], they defeated England (3<U+2013>2, recovering from a 2<U+2013>0 disadvantage), Romania (1<U+2013>0) with a late header from [[Costinha]] in [[injury time]], and Germany (3<U+2013>0, from a [[S<U+00E9>rgio Concei<U+00E7><U+00E3>o]] hat-trick), the last one using the B team, since they were already qualified in first of the group after the other two games, to finish atop their group and then defeated Turkey in the quarter-finals (2<U+2013>0, with both goals from [[Nuno Gomes]]).

In the semi-final meeting with World Cup holders France, Portugal scored first and nearly scored again due to an [[Abel Xavier]]'s header after France equalised. Portugal were eliminated in extra time by a [[golden goal]] when [[Zinedine Zidane]] converted a [[penalty kick|penalty]]. [[Austria]]n referee [[Gunter Benko]] awarded the spot kick for a handball after Abel Xavier blocked a shot from [[Sylvain Wiltord]] (Benko initially gave France a corner but changed his mind after consulting with [[Slovakia|Slovak]] linesman Igor Sramka). Xavier, Nuno Gomes (one of the top scorers in the tournament with four goals), and [[Paulo Bento]] were all given lengthy suspensions for shoving the referee.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/portugal/default.stm UEFA suspends Portuguese trio]</ref> The final result was 2<U+2013>1.

During the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 2|World Cup 2002 qualification]], Portugal made a crucial win against the Netherlands (2<U+2013>0 in [[Rotterdam]]) and ties against Republic of Ireland (1<U+2013>1 in both games) and the Netherlands (2<U+2013>2 in Porto), in Porto, after falling 2<U+2013>0 behind and scoring in the dyeing minutes of the game. Portugal won the group with seven wins and three ties with no defeats and 24 points (the same as the Republic of Ireland), but with a better goal average.

While the 2002 World Cup qualifying stage was unusually smooth, several problems and poor judgment decisions occurred during the preparation and tournament itself <U+2013> shopping sprees by players, this time in [[Macau]], were widely reported in the Portuguese press. Questionable managing choices and some amateurism, including the same lack of agreement on prizes. [[V<U+00ED>tor Ba<U+00ED>a]] replaced in-form [[Ricardo Pereira|Ricardo]] in [[goalkeeper|goal]], [[Roberto Severo|Beto]] played out of position at [[right back]], [[Lu<U+00ED>s Figo]] was in very poor physical condition, and [[Hugo Viana]] was called as a last-minute replacement for [[Daniel Kenedy]] (who tested positive in a [[doping]] control test) <U+2013> as Portugal underachieved and ended third in its group stage, subsequently eliminated. The manager [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Lu<U+00ED>s Alves Ribeiro Oliveira|Oliveira]] was fired after the World Cup.

Portugal entered the tournament as favourites to win Group D. However, they were upset 3<U+2013>2 by the [[USA national football team|United States]], at one point being three goals down in the match. They then rebounded with a 4<U+2013>0 smashing Poland, with [[Pauleta]] netting a [[hat-trick]]. 

Needing a draw to advance, they lost the final group game to hosts [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. [[Argentinian]] referee [[<U+00C1>ngel S<U+00E1>nchez (referee)|<U+00C1>ngel S<U+00E1>nchez]] sent off [[Jo<U+00E3>o Vieira Pinto]] for a tackle on [[Park Ji-Sung]]. [[Roberto Severo|Beto]] was ejected for his second yellow card of the match, reducing Portugal to nine men, and Park scored the winner to allow the Koreans to advance.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/portugal/newsid_2047000/2047782.stm FIFA suspends Pinto]</ref>

The next major competition, the [[UEFA Euro 2004]], was decided to be held in Portugal. On the preparation, the Football Federation made a contract with [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] to manage the team until the tournament ended. Despite the disappointed friendly matches, the Portuguese team entered the tournament being a favourite to win it.

[[Image:Portugiesische Fans bei der Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|Portuguese fans during Euro 2004]]
The host nation lost the first game against Greece 1<U+2013>2, an upset. They got their first win against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] 2<U+2013>0 and also beat a strong Spain side 1<U+2013>0, with the latter eventually knocked out in the group stages.

They went through and went on to play against England, in an entertaining 2<U+2013>2 draw that went into penalties, where [[Ricardo Pereira|Ricardo]] proved decisive, with an epic attitude taking off his goalkeeping gloves, saving a penalty and scoring right after the winner himself. Portugal beat the Netherlands 2<U+2013>1 in the semi-final with a [[Maniche]] strike from outside the box. They were eventually beaten by heavy underdog outsiders Greece 1<U+2013>0, credited to [[striker]] [[Angelos Charisteas]], marking the first time in the history of the competition that the final featured the same two teams as the opening match. The match was considered a huge upset win for Greece.

After the tournament ended, a lot of players belonging to the ''Gera<U+00E7><U+00E3>o de Ouro'' (Golden Generation), abandoned their international footballing careers, with only Lu<U+00ED>s Figo remaining in the team, despite a temporary retirement. While Portugal was playing in the competition, Scolari agreed in a new two-year deal with the Federation.

Portugal finished first in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 3|qualifying round for the 2006 World Cup]] with 30 points, nine games won, three draws, and no defeats. The second-placed Russia finished with seven points less. The ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o'' played with Estonia, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Russia, and Slovakia. Famous results include a home (7<U+2013>1) against Russia and an away tie with Liechtenstein (2<U+2013>2, after being winning 2<U+2013>0 at half-time).

Portugal finished first place in Group D of the WC finals, with victories over [[Angola national football team|Angola]] (1<U+2013>0, goal from Pauleta, the leading goalscorer in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifiers]]), Iran (2<U+2013>0, scored by [[Deco]], and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]) and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] (2<U+2013>1, goals from [[Maniche]] and [[Sim<U+00E3>o Sabrosa|Sim<U+00E3>o]]). Only Mexico's [[Francisco Fonseca]] was able to score against Portugal.

Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1<U+2013>0 in the Round of 16 on 25 June in [[Frankenstadion|Nuremberg]]. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match marked by 16 yellow cards, with four players ([[Khalid Boulahrouz]], [[Costinha]], Deco, and [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]) being sent off. (See the [[Battle of Nuremberg]].)

On 1 July at [[Veltins-Arena|Gelsenkirchen]], Portugal drew 0<U+2013>0 after extra-time with England, but won 3<U+2013>1 on [[penalty shootout|penalties]] to reach their first World Cup semi-final since 1966. The game was marred by a violent challenge on Portuguese defender [[Ricardo Carvalho]] by England's [[Wayne Rooney]], which resulted in him being sent off. Rooney later denied that it was intentional.

Portugal lost 1<U+2013>0 against France in the semi-finals on 5 July at [[Allianz Arena|Munich]]. Two players had been forced to sit out due to accumulated bookings from the round of 16 and quarter-finals. It did not help that the team faced a hostile crowd of English and French fans; they relentlessly booed Ronaldo for his perceived unsportsmanlike behavior in the previous round. As in the semi-finals of Euro 2000, Portugal were narrowly defeated by France, with the decisive goal being a penalty scored by [[Zinedine Zidane]] after [[Thierry Henry]] was awarded a penalty from a foul committed by Ricardo Carvalho.

Portugal faced Germany in the third place play-off match on 8 July in [[Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion|Stuttgart]]. The match was notable for being Pauleta's last game for the national team so as captain Lu<U+00ED>s Figo's last before retirement from international football <U+2013> though, surprisingly, he was not selected to start the game, coming on as a substitute near the end and setting up Portugal's goal in a 3<U+2013>1 defeat. All three German goals had the direct participation of [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], who scored twice and had another shot turned into an own goal by Portugal's [[Petit (Portuguese footballer)|Petit]]. Ultimately, the team won the "Most Entertaining Team" award for their play during the World Cup, in an award always organized through public participation in a poll. Once again Scolari was asked to accept a new deal with the Federation that would maintain with as the manager until the end of the next competition.

===Euro 2008 and beyond===
After the successes of the Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Portugal was seen as a major contender to win the [[Euro 2008]], but [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group A|their qualification]] wasn't easy. The national team faced some problems in the last games, in addition, Scolari was suspended for three games, being substituted by his assistant manager. Portugal ended with seven wins and twenty-seven points (one less than first-placed Poland). Armenia. Azerbaijan, Belgium, Finland, [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]], Poland and Serbia were the opponents. With important triumphs against Azerbaijan (2<U+2013>0 in [[Baku]]), Kazakhstan (2<U+2013>1 in [[Almaty]]) and Belgium (4<U+2013>0 in Lisbon and 2<U+2013>1 in [[Brussels]]), they managed to qualify for the final stage.

The Portuguese team was a featured part of TV network [[ESPN]]s ad campaign promoting their coverage of the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] tournament.<ref>[http://youtube.com/watch?v=2_7fKzasYjA&feature=related Euro 2008 promotional video, on YouTube]</ref> The first game was against Turkey and it was won 2<U+2013>0, with first-ever scoring achievements for internationals [[Pepe (footballer born 1983)|Pepe]] and [[Raul Meireles]]. Their second game was against the Czech Republic, a 3<U+2013>1 success. With assured qualification to the knockout stage, as first in group A, they played with the reserve team against Switzerland, and lost 2<U+2013>0, with two [[Hakan Yakin|Hakan Yak<U+0131>n]] goals. During the group stage, Scolari announced to the squad that it would be his last spell as the Portuguese manager, ending a five-year era full of prosperity.

On 19 June 2008, Portugal played against Germany, and were beaten 2<U+2013>3 after falling behind 0<U+2013>2 within the first half an hour. Portugal proceeded to score, followed by another German goal, a [[Michael Ballack]] header. Portugal scored a consolation goal in the final minutes of normal time, courtesy of [[H<U+00E9>lder Postiga]], but was eventually knocked out of Euro 2008 at the quarterfinal stage.

Portugal [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 1|participated in the qualifying stages]] with new manager [[Carlos Queiroz|Carlos Queir<U+00F3>s]] (who had already coached the team in older times), for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which is due to take place in [[South Africa]]. The team had a qualifying campaign that almost turned disastrous and just sneaked into second place by a single point over [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], a group where [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] finished first, one point ahead from Portugal. Portugal was drawn to play against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Second Round|european zone play-offs]]. With two wins (1<U+2013>0 in the first leg, in Lisbon; and 1<U+2013>0, in [[Zenica]]), the team gained its right to participate in the World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=284575&cc=5739|title=Meireles winner seals progress|date=2009-11-18|work=ESPN|accessdate=2009-11-19}}</ref>

Having qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the ''Selec<U+00E7><U+00E3>o das Quinas'' had it's most successful decade up to date, having qualified for all the editions of the World Cup and Euro Cup (Euro 2000, World Cup 2002, Euro 2004, World Cup 2006, Euro 2008, and World Cup 2010), along with [[Spain National Football Team|Spain]], [[Italy National Football Team|Italy]], [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]], and [[France National Football Team|France]], the only other four teams to have done so.
