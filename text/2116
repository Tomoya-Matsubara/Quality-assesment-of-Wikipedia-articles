'''''<U+00C6>on Flux''''' is a [[science fiction film]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Lakeshore Entertainment]]. It was released on [[December 2]] [[2005]]. The film is a loose adaptation of the [[animation|animated]] [[science fiction]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[<U+00C6>on Flux]]'', which was created by animator [[Peter Chung]] (who had a minor role in this film version of his work). The film stars [[Charlize Theron]] as the title character.

==Plot summary==
<!-- {{spoiler}} As written, this is not a spoiler, if more spoiling details are added, then remove this comment, and the one below with endspoiler -->

The film takes place 400 years into a post-apocalyptic future, after a virus has wiped out ninety-nine percent of the Earth's 2011 population. The survivors inhabit Bregna, a walled [[city-state]], which is ruled by a [[technocracy|congress of scientists]]. <U+00C6>on Flux is an assassin-member of the 'Monicans,' an underground rebel organization led by The Handler. When <U+00C6>on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader, [[Trevor Goodchild]] ([[Marton Csokas]]), she uncovers that she is the unwitting part of a secret [[coup]]. This discovery brings into question the origin and destiny of everyone in Bregna; and in particular, <U+00C6>on's personal connection to the man she has been sent to assassinate.

The film incorporates numerous elements from episodes of the TV series, most notably the episode "A Last Time For Everything," as well as from ''<U+00C6>on Flux: the Herodotus File'', a [[graphic novel]] that was based upon the series.

==Production==
The screenplay was written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (writers of teen drama<U+2013>romance ''[[Crazy/Beautiful]]'' and action<U+2013>comedy ''[[The Tuxedo]]''), and directed by [[Karyn Kusama]] (''[[Girlfight]]''). The character of <U+00C6>on Flux was played by [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winner [[Charlize Theron]]. 

In the early stages of production, actress [[Michelle Rodriguez]] was considered for the part of <U+00C6>on. This was perhaps due to her previous partnership with director Kusama in ''Girlfight''.

Karyn Kusama had originally suggested filming in [[Bras<U+00ED>lia]], [[Brazil]] because the architecture of that city fit with her vision of Bregna.  The idea was rejected because Bras<U+00ED>lia lacked the infrastructure and technical expertise to facilitate a major film production. After scouting several cities around the world, [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] was chosen as the location for filming.  This was also appropriate as the original comic series also featured a divided city. Berlin had several locations that fit into the organic yet structured world of ''<U+00C6>on Flux''.  The crew was able to gain access to several locations that had never allowed filming before including the Treptow Crematorium, the Trudelturm [[wind tunnel]] facility and the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]] ("House of the World's Cultures"). Additional locations include the handler space, a dissection theatre built in 1790 to train [[veterinarian|vets]] and the government buildings, set in the Berlin animal shelter <ref>''<U+00C6>on Flux'' DVD, ''The Locations of'' <U+00C6>on Flux ''featurette''.</ref>.

Filming was temporarily suspended for a month during [[September 2004]] while Theron recovered from a neck injury she suffered during [[stunt]]-work on the tenth day of shooting  while performing a back [[handspring (gymnastics)|handspring]].  She was hospitalized in Berlin for five days and it took about six weeks of [[physiotherapy]] to recover.

==Criticism==
[[Image:Aeonfluxfilmpicture1.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Charlize Theron]] as <U+00C6>on, in a fight scene from the film.]]
[[Paramount Pictures]] chose not to allow critics to review this film until two hours before it opened. This move, which made it impossible for critics to include reviews in the next day's paper, made some critics expect a bad film. The vast majority of reviews were negative. Some critics were surprised to change their prior assumptions.[http://www.slate.com/id/2130909/] The film took in only [[U.S. dollar|US$]]13.1 million in its opening weekend.

A number of people have criticized the marketing of this film, questioning the wisdom of releasing a science fiction action film during the holiday season (where light family-fare is the norm) with a minimum of promotion and sandwiched between two sure-fire box office dominators (''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'').

In many early and post-release interviews, Peter Chung was cautiously optimistic or evasive in his opinion of the film, in the following month he publicly criticized the movie in an interview [http://community.livejournal.com/monican_spies/44607.html]. Phil Hay, one of the [[scriptwriter]]s for the film, gave a response on the same website [http://community.livejournal.com/monican_spies/45470.html].  Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] described a visit from Peter Chung to the set in her DVD commentary (at 1:06:49), "And this is also when Peter Chung visited the set... and it was great to have him there, and have him feel that Charlize was bringing <U+00C6>on Flux to life the way that he had envisioned an actor would be able to.  And that he thought that the world of Bregna that we had created in the film was what he hoped it would be."  This seems at odds with Chung's public statement that the film is a "travesty" and seeing it in a theater made him feel "helpless, humiliated and sad."

Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi mentioned in an interview [http://dvdfile.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5430&Itemid=26] on dvdfile.com, conducted on [[May 5]], [[2006]], that the film was recut by the studio prior to release and that original director's cut contains nearly 30 minutes of additional footage. Hay and Manfredi praised Kusama's original version over the theatrically-released film.

==Comic book prequel==
In late 2005, [[Dark Horse Comics]] published a four-issue [[comic book]] [[limited series]] tying in with the movie. The storyline serves as a prequel to the film and is a mixture of Peter Chung's original TV series designs and characters combined with the setting and story elements of the movie. (There are some alterations: the [[comic book]] version of <U+00C6>on only loosely resembles Theron, while her colleague Sithandra, played by a black actress in the film, is depicted as a caucasian in the comic book). The first issue sets up <U+00C6>on Flux's mission for the miniseries: [[wikt:sabotage|sabotage ]] the Bregnan government's plan to destroy the forest outside of Bregna's walls. The last two issues of the limited series were published after the film had been released, and by the time the final issue came out, the film had already ended its run in most areas. Dark Horse has not announced if any further ''<U+00C6>on Flux''-based comics will be published.

==Video game==
{{main|<U+00C6>on Flux (video game)}}
On [[November 15]], [[2005]], a [[video game]] adaptation of the [[<U+00C6>on Flux (video game)|same name]] was released in [[North America]].

==Trivia==
*The film contains a [[Wilhelm Scream]], heard in a firefight as a Breen soldier falls off a roof.

*Una, portrayed as <U+00C6>on's little sister in the film, is also the name of a young female character in the episode "Isthmus Crypticus" from the animated series. However, in that episode the nature of Una's relation to <U+00C6>on is not detailed.
