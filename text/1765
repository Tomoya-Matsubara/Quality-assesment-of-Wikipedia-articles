'''United Airlines Flight 93''' was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark International Airport]], in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to [[San Francisco International Airport]]. It was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by four men as part of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Over 40 minutes into the flight the hijackers breached the cockpit, overpowered the pilots and took over control of the aircraft, diverting it toward [[Washington, D.C.]] Several passengers and crew members made telephone calls aboard the flight and learned about the attacks on the [[World Trade Center]] and [[the Pentagon]]. As a result, the passengers decided to mount an assault against the hijackers and wrest control of the aircraft.

The plane crashed in a field just outside [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], about {{convert|150|mi|km}} northwest of Washington, D.C., killing all 44 people aboard, including the hijackers. Many witnessed the impact from the ground and news agencies began reporting on the event within an hour. The plane fragmented upon impact, leaving a crater, and some debris was blown miles from the crash site. The remains of everyone on board the aircraft were later identified. Subsequent analysis of the [[flight recorder]]s revealed how the actions taken by the passengers prevented the aircraft from reaching either the [[White House]] or [[United States Capitol]]. A permanent memorial is planned for construction on the crash site. The chosen design has been the source of criticism and is scheduled to be dedicated in 2011.

The hijackers on these three flights had waited no more than 30&nbsp;minutes to commandeer the aircraft, most likely striking after the seat belt sign had been turned off and cabin service had begun.<ref name="Staff" /> It is unknown why the hijackers on Flight&nbsp;93 decided to wait approximately 46&nbsp;minutes to begin the assault. The flight suddenly dropped {{convert|685|ft|m}} in half a minute.<ref name="Staff" /> At 09:28:17, a crew member in the cockpit began shouting, "[[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]! Mayday!

Officials believe the hijackers assaulted the cockpit and moved the passengers to the rear of the plane at the same time to minimize any chance of either the crew or the passengers from interfering with the attack.<ref name="Staff" /> While the other hijacked flights were taken by five-man teams, Flight&nbsp;93 only had four hijackers, leading to speculation of a possible [[20th hijacker]]. The [[9/11 Commission]] believes that [[Mohamed al-Kahtani]] was the likely candidate for this role but was unable to participate as he was denied entry into the United States a month before.<ref name="Chap1" /> As many passengers on board later reported seeing only three hijackers, the 9/11 Commission believes Jarrah remained seated until the crew were overpowered and then took over the flight controls out of sight from any of the passengers.<ref name="Chap1" />
