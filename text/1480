}}'''Long Churn Cave''' is a cave in the [[Ingleborough]] area of the [[Yorkshire Dales]] caving area. First explored in 1870, it has become a popular location for beginner cavers and it contains the most famous squeeze in the Dales, the "Cheesepress". It is near Selside, about 15 km north of [[Ingleton, North Yorkshire]]. Access is by permission from the landowner at Selside Farm after payment of a nominal fee.

==Geology==
Created in limestone by the slow corrosion of slightly acidic rainwater over millions of years, the cave is split into two parts, "Lower Long Churn" and "Upper Long Churn", each active with a stream and is connected to the nearby [[Alum Pot]] and [[Diccan Pot]].<ref name=Caving/> Upper Long Churn can be entered via descent of a {{convert|4|m|ft|adj=on}} waterfall into "Dr Bannister's Handbasin", a moderately deep pool of water, and comprises a single long passage.<ref name=Reviewer>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/caves/caving-upper-amp-lower-long-churn/12686/|accessdate=07/04/2013|title=Caving Upper & Lower Long Churn|publisher=World Reviewer}}</ref> Lower Long Churn leads to an exit into Diccan Pot, followed by the "Cheesepress", a narrow squeeze which is notorious for its tightness but which can be bypassed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grough.co.uk/magazine/category/magazine/?p=2198|title=Try Caving? We did, and we loved it|accessdate=07/04/2013}}</ref><ref name=Reviewer/> The following part of the passage used to be aided by artificial aids (over the so-called "Plank Pool") but is no longer. The end of the Lower Long Churn is a chamber which opens on a window into Alum Pot, which is much more technically difficult to descent (or ascend).<ref name=Reviewer/>

The cave was first explored in 1870 by W. Boyd-Dawkins.<ref name=Caving>{{cite book

}}</ref> The system was written about by the outdoors author [[Alfred Wainwright]];
<blockquote>It is quite possible and in fact easy to die a horrible death by straying off route. The dangers of Alum Pot are manifestly obvious. Other deathtraps, unseen, occur in the black interiors of some of the caves.</blockquote>The cave is commonly used as in introduction to caving for novice and inexperienced cavers, although in stormy weather it fills with water and can prove dangerous; in 2007  a man and woman both drowned in the same incident,<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Guardian|title=Man and woman found drowned in flooded cave|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/dec/29/uknews4.mainsection3|accessdate=07/04/2013}}</ref> and in 2008 two separate groups were trapped in the cave during storms, although no lives were lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lessonslearned.org.uk/docs/Case%205%20Long%20Churn.pdf|title=Case 5 - Long Churn|accessdate=07/04/2013}}</ref>
