{{Seven Summits Map|caption=Map of the Seven Summits (actually nine, depending on definition).}}
The '''Seven Summits''' are the highest [[mountain]]s of each of the seven [[continent]]s. Summiting all of them is regarded as a [[mountaineering]] challenge, first postulated as such and achieved on April 30, 1985 by [[Richard Bass]] (Bass ''et al.'' 1986).

==Definition==
The Seven Summits are composed of each of the highest mountain peaks of each of the seven continents. Different lists include slight variations, but generally the same core is maintained throughout.

==Australia==
The highest mountain in the [[Australia|Australian mainland]] is [[Mount Kosciuszko]], {{Convert|2228|m|ft|0|link=on}} [[above sea level]]. However, the highest mountain in the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] which includes [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] is [[Puncak Jaya]], {{Convert|4884|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level,{{efn|1=A higher elevation of {{Convert|5030|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} still appears on some maps and sites, but is accepted by neither Indonesia nor the mountaineering community, nor is it supported by modern surveys. High resolution [[IFSAR]] data supplied by [http://www.intermap.com/ Intermap] shows no cell higher than {{Convert|4863|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. See also [http://www.papuaweb.org/dlib/bk/hope1976/index.html Australian Universities' Expedition] (section 2, page 4).}} in the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua, Indonesia|Papua]] on the island of [[New Guinea]] which lies on the Australian continental shelf. Puncak Jaya is also known as Carstensz Pyramid.

Some sources claim [[Mount Wilhelm]], {{Convert|4509|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, as the highest mountain peak in [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], on account of [[Indonesia]] being part of [[Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].<ref>[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/ljetopis/2007/51-bind.pdf Statistical Yearbook of Croatia, 2007]</ref> (See [[List of Southeast Asian mountains]], which includes Puncak Jaya and other mountains in [[Papua, Indonesia|Papua]], [[Indonesia]].) However, such a definition is political, not geophysical. The peak belongs to the [[Bismarck Range]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Europe==

The generally accepted highest summit is [[Mount Elbrus]] ({{Convert|5642|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], appearing on both the Bass and Mesner lists. However, because the location of the boundary between Asia and Europe is [[Boundary between Europe and Asia|not universally agreed upon]], its inclusion in Europe is disputed: if the [[Kuma<U+2013>Manych Depression|Kuma-Manych depression]] is used as geological border between Asia and Europe, Caucasus and Elbrus lie wholly in Asia. If the [[Greater Caucasus|Greater Caucasus watershed]] is used instead, Elbrus' peaks are wholly in Europe, albeit close to the border with Asia. [[Mont Blanc]] ({{Convert|4810|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) in the [[Graian Alps]] is seen by some to be the highest mountain in Europe, lying on the border between [[France]] and [[Italy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.8000ers.com/cms/7-summits-mainmenu-199.html |title=The Seven Summits |publisher=8000ers.com}}</ref>

==The ''Bass'' and ''Messner'' lists==
The first ''Seven Summits'' list as postulated by Bass (The ''Bass'' or ''Kosciusko'' list) chose the highest mountain of mainland Australia, Mount Kosciuszko ({{Convert|2228|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}), to represent the Australian continent's highest summit. [[Reinhold Messner]] postulated another list (the ''Messner'' or ''Carstensz'' list) replacing Mount Kosciuszko with [[Indonesia]]'s [[Puncak Jaya]], or Carstensz Pyramid ({{Convert|4884|m|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}). Neither the ''Bass'' nor the ''Messner'' list includes [[Mont Blanc]]. From a mountaineering point of view the ''Messner'' list is the more challenging one. Climbing Carstensz Pyramid has the character of an expedition, whereas the ascent of Kosciuszko is an easy hike. Indeed, [[Pat Morrow]] used this argument to defend his choice to adhere to the ''Messner'' list. "Being a climber first and a collector second, I felt strongly that Carstensz Pyramid, the highest mountain in Australasia ... was a true mountaineer<U+2019>s objective."{{sfn|Hamill|2012|p=284}}

==Mountaineering challenge==
The mountaineering challenge to climb the ''Seven Summits'' is traditionally based on either the ''Bass'' or the ''Messner'' list. (It is assumed that most of the mountaineers who have completed the ''Seven Summits'' would have climbed [[Mont Blanc]] as well.) As of January 2010, approximately 275 climbers climbed all seven of the peaks from either the ''Bass'' or the ''Messner'' list; about 30% of those have climbed all of the eight peaks required to complete both lists.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

===History===
[[Richard Bass]], a businessman and amateur mountaineer, set himself the goal of climbing the highest mountain on each of the seven continents, including mainland Australia. He hired [[David Breashears]] to guide him up [[Mount Everest]], the most difficult of his Seven, and completed his Everest summit on April 30, 1985.  He then co-authored the book ''Seven Summits'', which covered the undertaking (Bass ''et al.'' 1986).

[[Reinhold Messner]] revised Bass's list by using the broader definition of Oceania and including [[Puncak Jaya|Carstensz Pyramid]]  rather than Australia's [[Mount Kosciuszko]]. [[Pat Morrow]] first met Messner's challenge, finishing with climbing Carstensz Pyramid on May 7, 1986, shortly followed by Messner himself climbing [[Vinson Massif|Vinson]] on December 3, 1986. Morrow was also the first to complete all eight summits from both lists.

In 1990, [[Rob Hall]] and Gary Ball became the first to complete the "Seven Summits" in seven months. Using the ''Bass'' list, they started with Everest on May 10, 1990, and finished with Vinson on December 12, 1990, hours before the seven-month deadline.{{sfn|Krakauer|1997|pp=44<U+2013>45}}

In 1992 [[Junko Tabei]] became the first woman to complete the "Seven Summits".<ref name="si1996">{{cite magazine | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008036/index.htm | title = No Mountain Too High For Her: Junko Tabei defied Japanese views of women to become an expert climber | first = Robert last = Horn | magazine = [[Sports Illustrated]] | date = 29 April 1996 }}</ref>

[[Mary "Dolly" Lefever]] became the first American woman to climb the "Seven Summits" on March 11th, 1993, when she climbed Australia's [[Kosciusko]]. <ref>http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/dollylefever.htm</ref> <ref>http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/Mountaineering--One-Per-Continent.html</ref> She had previously climbed the others. <ref>http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/Mountaineering--One-Per-Continent.html</ref> Earlier in 1993 she had become the oldest surviving woman to have reached the summit of Mt. Everest; she was 47 years old. <ref>http://www.everesthistory.com/climbers/dollylefever.htm</ref>

In May 2002, [[Susan Ershler]] and her husband, Phil, became the first married couple to climb the "Seven Summits" together.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ershlers First Couple to Climb the Seven Summits|publisher=International Mountain Guides|url=http://www.mountainguides.com/pop_ershlers_everest.shtml}}</ref> The first person to complete Seven Summits without the use of supplemental oxygen on Mount Everest is Reinhold Messner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carstenszpapua.com/7summits-history.html |title=History of Seven Summits|publisher=carstenszpapua.com}}</ref> Miroslav Caban is probably the only other climber (besides Messner) as of October 2005 to finish the project without supplemental oxygen on Everest (finished in 2005 with Carstensz) (Ed Viesturs also summitted all peaks without supplemental oxygen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/10/19/czech-climber-tops-seven-summits.php|title=Czech climber tops seven summits|publisher=The Prague Post}}</ref>).

In January 2010, the Spanish climber [[Carlos Soria Font<U+00E1>n]] completed the seven summits (''Messner'' list), at the age of 71, after reaching the summit of Kilimanjaro. He had climbed the first one in 1968.<ref name="7cims">[http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20100128/deportes/carlos-soria-culmina-siete-cumbres-casi-71-anos.html?not=2010012802385768&idnot=2010012802385768&dia=20100128&seccion=deportes&seccion2=masNavarra&chnl=20 Carlos Soria culmina las "Siete Cumbres" casi a los 71 a<U+00F1>os] {{Es icon}}</ref>

On 23 May 2010, [[AC Sherpa]] summited [[Mt. Everest]] as his last and final conquest of the Seven Summits (''Bass'' list).  In doing this, he set a new record by climbing the seven summits within 42 climbing days. Additionally, when climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro (via Marangu) he summited in just 16 hours and 37 minutes, easily beating the previous record of 18 hours.

As of 24 December 2011, it is reported that only 118 people have climbed the Seven Summits if one assumes "full" completion of the quest requires climbing the "Eight Summits" across both the Bass and Messner lists (climbing both Carstenz Pyramid and Kosciusko in addition to the other six "undisputed" summits such as Everest). 231 persons have climbed the Messner list, while 234 have completed the Bass list. 348 have done either the Bass or Messner list.<ref>Harry Kikstra's 7Summits database at www.7summits.com</ref>

In 2012, [[Rohan Freeman]] became the first African-American and Jamaican to climb the Seven Summits.<ref>http://www.hartfordbusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121210/PRINTEDITION/312069966/1004&utm_source=enews&utm_medium=HBJ%2BToday&utm_campaign=Monday</ref><ref>http://landing.newsinc.com/shared/video.html?freewheel=91060&sitesection=wtic_mrn_590&VID=23908472</ref>

In 2013, [[Vanessa O'Brien]] became the fastest female to complete the Seven Summits (including Carstenz Pyramid), finishing in 10 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/culturedesk/2013/04/18/climber/QE0KzoLvVoOYpdvZSIJvUO/story.html |title=Boston's Vanessa O'Brien Completes 'Explorer's Grand Slam' in Record Time |publisher=Boston.com|date=April 2013}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Alpinism author [[Jon Krakauer]] (1997) wrote in ''[[Into Thin Air]]''{{sfn|Krakauer|1997|p=24}} that it would be a bigger challenge to climb the second-highest peak of each continent, known as the [[Seven Second Summits]]<U+2014>a feat that was not accomplished until January 2012. This is especially true for Asia, as [[K2]] (8,611 m) demands greater technical climbing skills than [[Mount Everest|Everest]] (8,848 m), while altitude-related factors such as the thinness of the atmosphere, high winds and low temperatures remain much the same. Some of those completing the seven ascents are aware of the magnitude of the challenge. In 2000, in a foreword to Steve Bell et al., ''Seven Summits'', Morrow opined with humility "[t]he only reason Reinhold [Messner] wasn<U+2019>t the first person to complete the seven was that he was too busy gambolling up the [[Eight-thousander|14 tallest mountains in the world]]."<ref>Morrow, Pat [http://courses.csusm.edu/lbst361bby/~DATA/~EVEREST-site/0_history/1985_7summits/00_Everest_7summits.pdf "Foreword"], ''Seven Summits'', pdf at courses.csusm.edu.
