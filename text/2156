'''James Fisher Robinson''' ([[October 4]], [[1800]] - [[October 31]], [[1882]]) was the twenty-second [[Governor of Kentucky]], serving the remainder of the unfinished term of Governor [[Beriah Magoffin]]. Magoffin, a Confederate sympathizer, became increasingly ineffective after the elections of [[1861]] yielded a [[supermajority]] to pro-Union forces in both houses of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]]. Magoffin agreed to resign the governorship, provided he could select his successor. He selected Robinson.

Politically, Robinson opposed both [[Secession#Confederate_States_of_America|secession]] and [[Abolitionism|abolition]].<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D. Clark]], [[Lowell H. Harrison]], and James C. Klotter |title=''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'' |year=1992 |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |isbn=0813117720 |chapter=Robinson, James Fisher}}</ref> Though he had Union sympathies, he was considered a moderate,<ref name=eok /> opposing both fugitive slave laws and the enlistment of [[African American|black]] soldiers.<ref name=kye /> As a state senator, he supported the [[Crittenden Compromise]] and opposed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=kye /> As governor, he drew criticism from the administration of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] for opposing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=eok />

==Early life==
Robinson was born to Jonathan and Jane Black Robinson in [[Scott County, Kentucky]] on [[October 4]], [[1800]].<ref name=powell>{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Robert A. |title=''Kentucky Governors'' |publisher=Bluegrass Printing Company |location=[[Danville, Kentucky]] |year=1976 |isbn=B0006CPOVM |chapter=James Fisher Robinson}}</ref> His early studies were done under a private tutor, then under [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister Robert Marshall.<ref name=powell /> He attended Forest Hill Academy and [[Transylvania University]], graduating in 1818.<ref name=nga /> His brother, [[John M. Robinson|John McCracken Robinson]] graduated in the same class and moved to [[Illinois]], where he eventually served two terms as a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]].<ref name=egle>{{cite book |last=Egle |first=William Henry |title=Pennsylvania Genealogies: Scotch-Irish and German |publisher=Lane S. Hart |location=[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] |year=1886 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d7_akH9VO_cC&dq=%22james+fisher+robinson%22 |pages=p. 553}}</ref> James Robinson studied law under [[William T. Barry]], and was admitted to the [[Bar association|bar]], beginning his practice in [[Georgetown, Kentucky]].<ref name=powell /> 

On [[December 29]], [[1821]], Robinson married Susan Mansell of Georgetown, the first of his three wives.<ref name=powell /> Mansell and Robinson had two children, a son and a daughter, before Mansell died in 1835.<ref name=egle /> Robinson married Willina S. Herndon of Scott County on [[March 21]], [[1839]].<ref name=powell /> The couple had eight children, seven of whom survived to adulthood.<ref name=egle /> Herndon died in 1861.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://firstlady.ky.gov/first+lady+dolls/First+Ladies+-+13th+-+22nd/pic10.htm |title=First Ladies: 13th through 22nd |publisher=Commonwealth of Kentucky |date=2005-08-25 |accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref>

==Political career==
Robinson's political career began in 1851, when he was elected to the [[Kentucky Senate]] as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]<ref name=kye /> without opposition.<ref name=powell /> He did not immediately seek re-election,<ref name=eok /> but was again elected to the state Senate in 1861 over challenger [[James B. Beck]].<ref name=powell /> He was elected Speaker of the Senate on [[September 2]], [[1861]], but resigned the post only a few days later.<ref name=harrison>{{cite book |title=''Kentucky's Governors'' |editor=[[Lowell H. Harrison]] |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]] |year=2004 |isbn=0813123267 |chapter=James F. Robinson}}</ref>

Robinson again assumed the position as Speaker of the Senate on [[August 16]], [[1862]] as part of a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor [[Beriah Magoffin]].<ref name=powell /> Magoffin's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[Linn Boyd]], had died in office in [[1859]], and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in line for the governorship, to succeed him.<ref name=powell /> Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in line for the governorship.<ref name=powell /> This was done, and at 10:00 a.m. on [[August 18]], [[1862]], Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation.<ref name=powell />

The [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was ongoing during Robinson's administration. During Robinson's tenure, the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] made its major advance into the Commonwealth.<ref name=kye /> In an attempt to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth, Robinson raised taxes in an effort to revive Kentucky's state [[militia]].<ref name=harrison /> He was also concerned with the effect the war had on public education in the state.<ref name=harrison /> He asked the General Assembly to investigate the condition of state schools, especially in war-ravaged areas, and encouraged them to accept the Lincoln administration's offer of land to establish an agricultural and mechanical college.<ref name=harrison />

Robinson proudly noted that by [[January 1]], [[1863]], a divided Kentucky had still managed to send 44,000 soldiers &ndash; fifty-one regiments &ndash; to aid the Union cause.<ref name=harrison /> At the same time, he lamented what he perceived as poor treatment of the state as disloyal by the Federal government.<ref name=harrison /> He cited examples such as the declaration of [[martial law]] in the Commonwealth and the suspension of the right of [[habeus corpus]] for its citizens.<ref name=harrison /> He answered President Lincoln's contention "that military necessity is not to be measured by Constitutional limits" by warning "If military necessity is not to be measured by Constitutional limits, we are no longer a free people."<ref name=harrison />

On completion of his term, Robinson supported his eventual successor, [[Thomas E. Bramlette]].<ref name=harrison /> The constitutional questions Robinson raised during his administration shaped much of the political debate for Bramlette's term.<ref name=harrison />

==Later life and death==
Following his term as governor, Robinson retired to "Cardome," his family farm in Scott County.<ref name=powell /> Politically, he became more distant from the national administration, supporting [[George B. McClellan]] for president in [[1864]].<ref name=kye /> He served as president of the Farmers' Bank of Georgetown and chair of the [[Georgetown College]] Board of Trustees.<ref name=nga /> On [[December 1]], [[1873]], he married his third wife, Caroline "Carrie" Hening of Georgetown, who was 36 years his junior.<ref name=powell /> He died on [[October 31]], [[1882]], and is buried in the Georgetown Cemetery in [[Georgetown, Kentucky]].<ref name=nga />
