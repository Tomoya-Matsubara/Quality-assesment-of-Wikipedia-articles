The '''2011 Canadian Grand Prix''', formally the '''Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada 2011''',<ref name="GP du"/> was the seventh round of the [[2011 Formula One season]] and was held on 12 June 2011 at the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fia.com/en-GB/mediacentre/pressreleases/wmsc/2010/Pages/wmsc_031110.aspx|title=World Motor Sport Council: 03/11/2010|work=fia.com|publisher=[[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]|date=3 November 2010|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> It was the 48th Canadian Grand Prix, and the 32nd to be held at the circuit since its d<U+00E9>but on the calendar in {{F1|1978}}.

The race was won by McLaren driver Jenson Button who overtook Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel on the last lap, making a total of 34 passes throughout the race. The race made new records with it being the [[List_of_Formula_One_records#Race_records|longest in F1 history lasting 4 hours 4 minutes and 39 seconds]] after the race was red flagged for approximately two hours due to heavy rain. The safety car was also deployed six times, [[List_of_Formula_One_records#Race_records|which broke the record for the most times a safety car has been deployed]] in a single race.

==Report==
===Background===
In the week leading up to the {{F1 GP|2011|Spanish}}, FIA race director [[Charlie Whiting]] announced that the Canadian Grand Prix would see the introduction of a secondary Drag Reduction System (DRS) activation zone, with the first being used on the long back straight and the second along the front straight.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/91556|title=Double DRS zone from Canadian GP|first=Edd|last=Straw|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymaret Publications]]|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> The plan for a secondary DRS zone would be continued at the {{F1 GP|2011|European}}, with future use depending on its success in Montreal and Valencia.

===Practice===
In the first free practice session, [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Jenson Button]] suffered mechanical issues, it was a bad session for both Red Bull and McLaren whilst Mercedes and Ferrari were consistently quicker. Vettel crashed into the "Wall of Champions", so-called because former world champions [[Damon Hill]], [[Michael Schumacher]], [[Jacques Villeneuve]] and [[Jenson Button]] have all crashed at the same spot in the past.<ref name="autosport fp1">{{cite news|last=Elizalde|first=Pablo|title=Rosberg fastest, Vettel crashes in FP1|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/92124|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> 

[[Sergio P<U+00E9>rez]] was still experiencing after-effects of his accident in Monaco during first free practice and he withdrew from the event. Former Sauber driver and McLaren test driver [[Pedro de la Rosa]] replaced him from second free practice onwards.<ref name="autosport">{{cite news|last=Elizalde|first=Pablo|title=De la Rosa replaces unwell Perez|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/92134|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> He reportedly had just ten minutes' warning that he would be racing for Sauber<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/92164 | title = De la Rosa had 10-minute warning | first1 = Jonathan | last1 = Noble | first2 = Pablo | last2 = Elizalde | work = Autosport | publisher = Haymarket Publications | date = {{date|2011-06-10}} | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-11}} }}</ref> and completed the second practice session in his McLaren racing overalls. De la Rosa lost over an hour of the second session while P<U+00E9>rez's car was adapted to his specifications, but still managed to post the 18th fastest time. [[Fernando Alonso]] was fastest, though the session was suspended twice due to separate accidents involving [[Kamui Kobayashi]] and [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me d'Ambrosio]] at the same corner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/92136 | title=Alonso tops interrupted second practice |first = Pablo | last = Elizalde | date={{date|2011-06-10}} | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-11}} | work = Autosport | publisher=Haymarket Publications }}</ref>

In Practice 3, [[Mark Webber]] experienced a KERS issue meaning he was unable to take part in the session, whilst the session's quickest time was recorded by Vettel with 1:13.381, just ahead of Alonso and [[Nico Rosberg]] who at one point set identical fastest times. [[Felipe Massa]] also did well in the session with [[Jenson Button]] suffering braking problems towards the end. During the session, [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]], [[Narain Karthikeyan]], [[Timo Glock]] and d'Ambrosio failed to set times within the 107% rule on the same tyres as the front runners. After Friday's sunny weather, Saturday was more cloudy with some rain. 

===Qualifying===
In the first part of qualifying there was a fight between the Saubers and the Toro Rossos to get through to the second part of the session. Eventually it was [[Jaime Alguersuari]] who was knocked out, missing out on the top 17 drivers by just under a tenth of a second. In the second element of the session, [[Paul di Resta]] was knocked out, only a couple of tenths behind [[Nick Heidfeld]], whilst de la Rosa and [[Rubens Barrichello]] were the slowest two drivers, both outqualified by their team-mates Kobayashi and [[Pastor Maldonado]] by three tenths of a second.

In the final ten-minute session, all the teams other than Mercedes decided to do two flying laps. Vettel set the quickest time on his first timed lap, which ultimately gave him his sixth pole position in seven races in {{F1|2011}}. In the closing moments of the session, Massa and Alonso improved their times to complete the top three drivers, with Alonso just outqualifying his team-mate.

===Race===
The start and the first four laps took place under Safety Car conditions, during which Button got a penalty for speeding while the safety car was deployed. When the Safety Car pulled off the track, Alonso unsuccessfully attacked Vettel whilst Hamilton and Webber made contact between turns 1 and 2. Webber's car was spun around and he dropped to 14th, while Hamilton continued 7th. Then the latter passed Button but dropped behind him on the sixth lap as an overtaking move on Schumacher (5th at the moment) failed to come off at the hairpin. Going across the start/finish line at the end of lap seven Hamilton pulled out to pass Button again, but as Button moved to the left they made contact and Hamilton hit the pit wall. Hamilton retired with a broken left rear wheel and suspension. The race was subsequently [[Racing_flags#The_red_flag|red-flagged]] due to heavy rain on lap 25, for a period of around two hours until the torrential rain in the area had cleared.

As the race went on Button, the Mercedes cars and Alonso made the wrong decision with tyres on the intermediates. Whilst at the time the intermediates were better, Massa and Vettel got free of pit stops by waiting until the rain got heavy again. Kobayashi and de la Rosa were second and ninth when the race was stopped, Heidfeld and Petrov were fourth and fifth and di Resta was sixth.

On the last lap, Vettel made a mistake at turn six and Button overtook him to win the race. Vettel finished second, Webber third with Schumacher in fourth. Behind fifth-placed Petrov, Massa caught Kobayashi and passed him on the finishing line to take sixth place by a four and a half hundredths of a second.
