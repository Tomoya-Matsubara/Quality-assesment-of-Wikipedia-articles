'''James Howard "Jim" Thome''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|t|o<U+028A>|m|i}};<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome Stats|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/2604/jim-thome|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref> born August 27, 1970) is an American [[professional baseball]] [[designated hitter]] and [[first baseman]] who is currently a free agent in [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball (MLB)]]. A five-time [[MLB All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]], he has played for the [[Cleveland Indians]] (1991<U+2013>2002, 2011), [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (2003<U+2013>2005, 2012), [[Chicago White Sox]] (2006<U+2013>2009), [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2009), [[Minnesota Twins]] (2010<U+2013>2011) and [[Baltimore Orioles]] (2012).

In 1996 he won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] and in 2006 the [[Major League Baseball Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year Award]]. His additional accolades include the [[Roberto Clemente Award]] (2002), [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] (2003), and [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]] (2004). In 2011, he became the eighth MLB player to hit [[500 home run club|600 home runs]]. He is currently seventh all-time for most career home runs (612) and 24th all-time for [[runs batted in]] (RBIs) with 1,699.

Thome was part of a Cleveland Indians core which led the franchise to two [[World Series]] appearances in three years during the mid-1990s. The group went to two World Series, but lost both. In [[1995 World Series|1995]], they lost to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in six games while in [[1997 World Series|1997]] they lost to the young [[Florida Marlins]] franchise in seven games. His trademarks include his high socks, which he helped make popular again in the mid-'90s, a time when players wore their pant cuffs down around their ankles; his batting stance, during which he holds the bat out with his right hand and points it at right field before the pitcher comes set; and his consistent positive attitude.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Posnanski|first=Joe|title=Still Going Strong|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=27 September 2010|volume=113|issue=11|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1174607/4/index.htm|accessdate=18 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=Veteran DH Jim Thome won't return to O's until September|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-08-06/sports/bs-sp-orioles-notes-0807-20120806_1_neck-spasms-orioles-manager-jim-thome|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=18 November 2012|date= 6 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=Orioles DH Jim Thome will be out for at least another month|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-08-06/sports/bal-orioles-dh-jim-thome-will-be-out-for-at-least-another-month-20120806_1_stu-pomeranz-orioles-manager-buck-showalter-neck-spasms|accessdate=18 November 2012|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=6 August 2012}}</ref>

==Early life==
Thome was born in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Illinois]] on August 27, 1970, just minutes after twin sister Jenny. The youngest of five children, Thome was born into an athletic family. His grandmother was hired at [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] so she could play for the company softball team. His father also played softball in a circuit known as the Outlaw League, occasionally for pay. Thome's two older brothers, Chuck III and Randy, played baseball at [[Limestone Community High School District 310|Limestone High School]].<ref name=JockBio>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome Biography|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Thome/Thome_bio.html|work=JockBio|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref>

Like his brothers, Thome also attended Limestone.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome <U+2013> Biography|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0859761/bio|work=IMDB|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> He was all-state in both baseball and basketball.<ref name="JockBio"></ref> While at Limestone, Thome played shortstop. He had hoped to be noticed by scouts, but at his relatively small frame ({{convert|6|ft|2|in|m}} {{convert|175|lb|kg}}), he attracted only passing interest. He graduated in 1988. After not being drafted in 1988, Thome enrolled at [[Illinois Central College]] and continued both his baseball and basketball careers.<ref name="JockBio" /> He played one season at Illinois Central before being drafted by the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1989.

==MLB career==
===Cleveland Indians (1991<U+2013>2002)===
Thome was drafted by Cleveland in the 13th round of the [[1989 Major League Baseball Draft]]. He was originally assigned to the Indians' [[Gulf Coast League]] squad, where he played exclusively in 1989 posting a stat line of .237 with no home runs and 22 RBIs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome Career Profile|url=http://www.minorleagueball.com/2011/1/21/1949238/jim-thome-career-profile|work=Minor League Ball|accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref> During his first summer with Cleveland, he first met mentor and later manager [[Charlie Manuel]].<ref name="JockBio"></ref> In 1990, he combined to hit .340 with 16 home runs and 50 RBIs playing at both the Rookie and A levels. After splitting the majority of the 1991 season between AA and AAA where he combined to hit .319 with seven home runs and 73 RBIs, Thome made his Major League debut on September 4, 1991 as a [[third baseman]] against the [[Minnesota Twins]]. In the game he went 2-for-4 and recorded his first hit off pitcher [[Tom Edens]] in the fourth inning. He hit his first career home run on October 4 against [[New York Yankees]] pitcher [[Steve Farr]].

Thome had an injury-riddled 1992 campaign in which he played for both the Indians and the [[Colorado Springs Sky Sox]], the Indians' AAA affiliate at the time. He combined to play 52 games with four home runs and 26 RBIs while hitting .236.<ref name=WWIB>{{cite book|title=Who's Who in Baseball, 2007|year=2007|editor=Palmer, Pete|publisher=Who's Who in Baseball Magazine Co.|location=New York|isbn=0-910692-26-2|pages=169<U+2013>170}}</ref> 

Thome played mostly for the [[Charlotte Knights]], the Indians' new AAA affiliate, in 1993. He hit .332 with 102 RBIs, both of which led the [[International League]]. He also hit 25 home runs. This performance earned him a late season call up in which he hit .266 with seven home runs and 22 RBIs in 47 games.<ref name=WWIB></ref>

In the 1994 offseason, Cleveland made several offseason acquisitions in an attempt to compete after six consecutive sub-.500 seasons. [[Sandy Alomar Jr.]], [[Kenny Lofton]], [[Carlos Baerga]], and [[Mark Clark (baseball)|Mark Clark]] were brought in to work with Thome and 22 year old [[Manny Ramirez]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Kazzie|first=David|title=After 40 years of futility, Tribe will dance to new drum|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mKMcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q28EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5936,6330095&dq=cleveland+indians+1994+offseason&hl=en|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=The Cavalier Daily|date=6 April 1994}}</ref> For the first time in his career, Thome spent the entire year with Cleveland playing in 98 games while hitting .268 with 20 home runs and 52 RBIs.

Despite Thome's statistical improvement in 1994, it was not until {{mlby|1995}} that the Indians' success led to a playoff berth. Thome led the team by hitting .314 with 25 home runs and 73 RBIs. The Indians went 100<U+2013>44 to win the American League Central, though they eventually lost the World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games, who had won ten fewer games in the regular season.<ref name="JockBio" /> Thome hit .211 in the World Series with one home run and two RBIs.<ref name=WWIB></ref>

He then hit 38 home runs in 1996, once hitting a 511-foot (156-m) shot at Cleveland's [[Jacobs Field]]. It is the longest home run ever recorded at a Cleveland ballpark.<ref name="library" />

Originally a third baseman, he was shifted to first base when the Indians traded for [[Matt Williams (third baseman)|Matt Williams]] in 1997.<ref name="library">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Jim_Thome_1970 |title=The Ballplayers <U+2013> Jim Thome |accessdate=8 July 2009 |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com}}</ref>
In 1997, Thome helped the Indians connect for a club record 220 home runs by contributing 40 of them to go along with 33 from [[David Justice]] and 32 from Williams. Thome also totaled an AL high 120 [[base on balls|walks]] to go along with 102 RBIs. Cleveland returned to the [[1997 World Series|World Series]] that year behind their record offense, but they lost to the Florida Marlins in seven games. <ref name="JockBio"></ref> Thome hit .286 with two home runs and four RBIs. <ref name=WWIB></ref>

The next three seasons would not achieve the same level of success for either Thome or the Indians as the previous three had. On July 14, 1998, Thome hit his 24th home run of the season while helping the Indians snap the Yankees' 10 game winning streak.<ref>{{cite news|first=AP|title=Thome powers Indians|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=i7oaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ui4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5888,6562871&dq=jim+thome&hl=en|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 July 1998|page=5C}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=AP|title=Thome, Wright spark Indians by Yankees|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pKxeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yi4MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3092,3327272&dq=jim+thome&hl=en|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=Lewiston Morning Tribune|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=14 July 1998|page=4B}}</ref> On August 8, Thome broke a bone in his right hand and spent five weeks on the disabled list.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cleveland Loses Thome In Victory at Tampa Bay|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/08/sports/american-league-roundup-cleveland-loses-thome-in-victory-at-tampa-bay.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=WWIB></ref> He finished the year with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs while posting a .293 batting average.

On May 31, 1999, in a rematch of the prior year's ALCS, Thome hit a grand slam against the Yankees off of [[Orlando Hernandez]], which powered Cleveland to a 7<U+2013>1 victory.<ref>{{cite news|title=CNN/SI AL Recap (Cleveland-NY Yankees)|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/al/scoreboards/1999/05/31/recap.NYY-CLE.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=CNN/SI|date=31 May 1999}}</ref> In total, he regressed in batting average, falling to .277, but improved both his home run and RBI totals by posting 33 and 108 respectively.

The 2000 season would prove to be a statistical regression for Thome. On June 21, Thome hit his 20th home run of the year against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. This marked the seventh consecutive season in which Thome hit 20 or more home runs.<ref>{{cite news|title=MLB SCOREBOARD: Recap|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/al/recaps/2000/06/21/white.sox_indians/|accessdate=29 October 2012|newspaper=CNN/SI|date=22 June 2000}}</ref> On September 29, while in the midst of a tight race for the wildcard spot, Thome led the Indians to a victory against the [[2000 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] by hitting a two-run home run to lead the Indians to an 8<U+2013>4 victory.

Though the emergence of Howard made Thome less important to the squad, another primary factor to his shipment to Chicago was his family situation.

He also set a major league record by scoring in each of the White Sox's first 17 games. The modern and AL record for consecutive games with a run scored is 18 held by [[Red Rolfe]] (1939) and [[Kenny Lofton]] (2000). For the season, Thome hit 42 home runs, batted in 109 runs, and hit .288.

[[File:Jim Thome 2008.jpg|250px|thumb|Thome in 2008]] 
Thome was one of three [[White Sox]] players (also two coaches) who wore jersey number 42 in recognition of the 60th anniversary of [[Jackie Robinson]]'s Major League debut in the White Sox vs. Indians game in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] on April 15, 2007. Thome pinch-hit for [[Brian Anderson (outfielder)|Brian Anderson]] in the ninth inning and hit an [[infield]] single. On September 16, Thome hit his 500th career home run off [[Los Angeles Angels]] pitcher [[Dustin Moseley]]. The home run was a [[walk-off home run|walk-off]] in the bottom of the ninth inning with one man on base, which gave the White Sox a 9<U+2013>7 victory.<ref name="p22">[[Sports Illustrated]], 24 September 2007, p. 22</ref> Thome became the 23rd major leaguer to reach the milestone and the third in the 2007 season (the others were Frank Thomas and Alex Rodriguez) as well as the first ever to do it with a walk-off shot.<ref name="p22" /> Several family members were on hand to witness the accomplishment, which happened to occur on Thome [[bobblehead]] giveaway day. Thome rounded the bases pointing upward in homage to his mother, who died from breast cancer in January 2005.<ref name="JockBio"></ref>

Two months later on August 14, Thome hit the first of four consecutive home runs by the White Sox. On September 30, he hit a solo shot in the [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|AL Central Tiebreaker game]] which proved to be the difference as the White Sox defeated the Minnesota Twins 1<U+2013>0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHA/CHA200809300.shtml |title=September 30, 2008 Minnesota Twins at Chicago White Sox Play by Play and Box Score |accessdate=8 July 2009|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref>

===Minnesota Twins (2010<U+2013>2011)===
[[File:Thome.jpg|thumb|right|Thome hitting a solo home run off of Cleveland's Fausto Carmona at Target Field, September 21, 2010]] When the Twins opened their [[Target Field]] on April 12, 2010, Thome, for the third time in his career, was a part of an organization that celebrated the grand opening of a new home stadium. The other two openings he was part of were the 1994 Cleveland Indians as they opened Jacobs Field and the 2004 [[Philadelphia Phillies]] as they opened [[Citizens Bank Park]]. He hit his first home run with the Twins on April 8, during the Twins' season-opening road trip. On June 19, Thome returned to his former team, the Phillies, and hit a pinch hit game winning home run in the 11th inning off of [[Danys Baez]]. The Twins won the game 13<U+2013>10.

On July 3, Thome hit his 573rd and 574th home runs. In doing so he displaced fellow Twins player [[Harmon Killebrew]] for number 10 on the all-time home run leaders list. The game was stopped and the Twins played a pre-recorded message from Killebrew congratulating Thome on the accomplishment during which he said, "I'm glad he was able to hit it in a Twins uniform. I only wish I could have been there to see it."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kay|first=Joe|title=Thome hits 600th home run|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/08/16/1415685/rookie-hazing-changing.html#storylink=misearch|work=Baseball - NewsObserver.com|publisher=The News & Observer Publishing Company|accessdate=2 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Thome passes Harmon Killebrew for 10th place on HR list|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/Jim-Thome-passes-Harmon-Killebrew-for-10th-place-on-HR-list-070310|work=MLB News|publisher=Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> 

Thome hit the first [[walk-off]] hit in Target Field on August 17, a 445-foot two-run home run in the bottom of the 10th inning against the [[Chicago White Sox]]. It was the 12th walk-off home run of his career, tying him for first all time (with [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Stan Musial]], [[Frank Robinson]], and [[Babe Ruth]]). On September 4, Thome again hit two home runs in a single game to tie and then pass [[Mark McGwire]] for the ninth spot on the career home run list. Thome passed Robinson on September 11, when he hit his 587th career home run in the top of the 12th inning in Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE201009110.shtml |title=September 11, 2010 Minnesota Twins at Cleveland Indians Play by Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=11 September 2010 |accessdate=14 September 2011}}</ref>

On January 14, 2011, Thome accepted a one-year, $3 million contract with incentives to continue playing for the Twins.

===Second stint with Philadelphia (2012)===
[[File:Jim Thome on June 9, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Thome during his second stint with the Phillies in 2012]]
On November 4, 2011, Thome agreed to a one year, $1.25 million deal with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. He mentioned in his news conference that coming back to Philadelphia was a "no-brainer". He also mentioned that, in light of the Achilles injury to Ryan Howard, he would "spend the offseason preparing himself to play first base once or twice a week", despite not playing in the field since 2007. He started his first game at first base on April 8, 2012, where he started a 3<U+2013>6<U+2013>3 double play. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111104&content_id=25915372&vkey=news_mlb&c_id=mlb#disqus_thread|title=Thome back with Phillies on one-year deal|date=4 November 2011|accessdate=2011-11-05|first=Todd|last=Zolecki|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|work=MLB.com}}</ref> 

Thome experienced stiffness in his lower back in a game against the Chicago Cubs on April 28, and did not finish the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-05-01/news/31519812_1_ryan-howard-charlie-manuel-phillies|title=Jim Thome struggling as pinch-hitter|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=1 May 2012|last=Brookover|first=Bob}}</ref> In May, he was placed by the Phillies on the 15-day disabled list with a strained lower back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/fantasy/injuries/#team143|title=Injury Report|work=MLB.com|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> Thome was only batting .100 at the time.

Thome returned to the club in early June, and prepped for [[Interleague Play]] against the [[Baltimore Orioles]] as the DH. He went 3-for-5 with an RBI in his first game after returning, and hit a home run in the following game. Thome finished the nine-game interleague road trip with four home runs and 14 RBIs. 

On June 17, Thome became the fourth major league player, joining Reggie Jackson, Darrell Evans and Alex Rodriguez, to hit 100 home runs with three different teams. Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off home run in the ninth inning off of [[Jake McGee]] to beat the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] 7<U+2013>6. This was Thome's 609th home run, tying [[Sammy Sosa]] for seventh all time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thome's walk-off caps day of Phils milestones|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_06_23_tbamlb_phimlb_1&mode=recap_home&c_id=phi|date=23 June 2012|accessdate=2012-06-24|first=Jake|last=Kaplan|work=MLB.com|publisher=MLB Advanced Media}}</ref> The home run was also the first pinch-hit home run of Thome's career.

Thome's last game as a Phillie was in an afternoon loss to the [[Miami Marlins]] on June 30. After the game (which coincided with Ryan Howard's return from the disabled list), it was officially announced that Thome had been traded to Baltimore to serve as their designated hitter.

===Baltimore Orioles (2012)===
Thome was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for a pair of minor league players, pitcher [[Kyle Simon]] and catcher [[Gabriel Lino]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://baltimore.orioles.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120630&content_id=34230330&vkey=news_bal&c_id=bal|author=Luca, Greg|title=Orioles acquire Thome for two prospects|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|work=MLB.com|date=June 30, 2012|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> The Orioles cited the need for Thome's veteran experience on a playoff bound team as a primary factor to acquiring him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baltimore Orioles acquire Philadelphia Phillies' slugger Jim Thome|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/8117305/baltimore-orioles-acquire-philadelphia-phillies-slugger-jim-thome|work=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Dan|title=Orioles close to closing deal for Jim Thome|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-06-30/sports/bal-orioles-close-to-closing-deal-for-jim-thome-20120630_1_orioles-trade-orioles-manager-buck-showalter-orioles-executive-vice-president|accessdate=28 November 2012|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=30 June 2012}}</ref> 
He got his first hit, a single, against the [[Seattle Mariners]] on July 2.

After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, "There's a lot memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's.

It was reported on [[ESPN]]'s [[SportsCenter]] that shortly after his nephew, Brandon, was paralyzed in an accident, he asked Thome to hit a home run for him; Thome granted the request by hitting two in the subsequent game.
