'''''The Colbert Report''''' ({{pron-en|ko<U+028A>l<U+02C8>b<U+025B>r r<U+0259><U+02C8>p<U+0254>r}}<U+2014>''t'' is silent in both "Colbert" and "Report") is a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] award-winning American [[news satire|satirical]] [[late night]] [[television program]] that airs Monday through Thursday on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States and on both [[The Comedy Network]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada. It stars political humorist [[Stephen Colbert]], a former [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Daily Show]]''.

''The Colbert Report'' is a [[spin-off]] of and counterpart to ''The Daily Show'' that, like ''The Daily Show'', critiques politics and the media. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] programs, particularly [[Fox News]]' ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/27/060327fa_fact|title=Bill O'Reilly's baroque period.|first=Nicholas|last=Lemann|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2006-03-20|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref name="avclub">{{cite news|url =http://www.avclub.com/articles/stephen-colbert,13970/|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060202094518/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/44705|archivedate=2006-02-02|title = Stephen Colbert interview|first = Nathan|last = Rabin|work = [[The A.V.

The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status [[Idiot (usage)|idiot]]", is a caricature of televised political pundits.<ref name="NYTIMES25Q">{{cite news|first=Deborah|last=Solomon|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/25/magazine/25questions.html|title=Funny About the News|work=[[New York Times Magazine]]|date=2005-09-25|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref name=newsweek2>{{cite web|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060425101629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/|archivedate=2006-04-25|title = The Truthiness Teller|first = Marc|last = Peyser|work = [[Newsweek]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date = February 16, 2006|accessdate = 2006-02-18}}</ref>

''The Colbert Report'' has been nominated for four [[Emmy]]s each in 2006, 2007 and 2008, two [[Television Critics Association]] Awards, and two [[Satellite Awards]]. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, by the [[Tom DeLay]] Legal Defense Trust, and following [[Robert Wexler]]'s interview on the program. ''The Report'' received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's popularizing of the term "[[truthiness]]", which [[dictionary]] [[publisher]] [[Merriam-Webster]] named its 2006 [[Word of the Year]].<ref name="mw">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm|title=Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year 2006|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>
''The Report'' has also coined other [[neologism]]s, such as "freem".

''The Report'' has had cultural influence in a number of ways. In 2006, after Colbert encouraged viewers to vote online to name a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] bridge after him, he won the first round of voting with 17,231,724 votes.<ref name=First_round>{{cite web| url = http://index.hu/gazdasag/magyar/colb060822/ | title = A seggfej Zr<U+00ED>nyi el<U+0151>tt amerikai humorista nyerte a h<U+00ED>dn<U+00E9>vversenyt | accessdate = 2008-09-02 | date = 2006-08-22 | work = Index.hu | language = Hungarian }}</ref> [[Andr<U+00E1>s Simonyi|The Ambassador of Hungary]] presented Mr. Colbert with a declaration certifying him as the winner of the second and final round of voting, though it was later announced that the bridge would be named the [[Megyeri Bridge]].

In 2007, the Democratic Caucus chair, [[Rahm Emanuel]], instructed freshmen Representatives not to appear on the show's "[[Better Know a District]]" segment.<ref name="The Hill">{{cite news | last =Kaplan | first =Jonathan E. | title =Emanuel tells freshmen to avoid Stephen Colbert | publisher =[[The Hill]] | date=  2007-03-13 | url = http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/emanuel-tells-freshmen-to-avoid-stephen-colbert-2007-03-14.html | accessdate = 2008-09-02 }}</ref>

== Production ==

[[File:thecolbertgang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stephen Colbert|Colbert]] on "''The Colbert Gang''"]]
In 2005, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' had won [[Emmy Award]]s, and Comedy Central wanted to expand the franchise.<ref name="NYMag1016">{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/news/politics/22322/ |title=Stephen Colbert Has America By the Ballots |publisher=[[New York Magazine]] |date=2006-10-16 |last=Sternbergh |name=Adam |accessdate=2006-10-10}}</ref> Producers were also looking for a way to hold on to Colbert, ''Daily Show'' correspondent and co-writer for six seasons, after the show's other breakout star, [[Steve Carell]], left the program to pursue a successful career in film and network television. [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Ben Karlin]] (''The Daily Show''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s executive producer) supposedly came up with the idea for ''The Colbert Report'' after watching coverage of the [[sexual harassment]] lawsuit filed against [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]. Jon Stewart's production company, [[Busboy Productions]], developed ''The Report''. Colbert, Stewart, and Karlin pitched the idea of the show (reportedly with one phrase: "our version of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' with Stephen Colbert") to [[Comedy Central]] chief [[Doug Herzog]], who agreed to run the show for eight weeks without creating a pilot.<ref name="USATodayLevin">{{cite news| title=First 'Stewart,' now 'Colbert'| last=Levin| name=Gary | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-10-13-colbert_x.htm| publisher=[[USA Today]]| date=2005-10-13 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

''The Colbert Report'' first appeared in the form of three [[television commercial]]s for itself which aired several times on ''The Daily Show'', although the themes that form the basis for ''The Report'' can be seen in the reports of Colbert's correspondent character on ''The Daily Show''. The show debuted October 17, 2005, with an initial contract for an eight-week run. On November 2, 2005 based on the strong [[Nielsen Ratings|ratings]] for the show's first two weeks, Comedy Central and Colbert announced they had signed for an additional year, through the end of 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/index.jsp?tnews| title=Comedy Central Keeps Colbert| first=Charlie| last=Amter| date=2005-11-02| publisher=[[E!

=== Program format ===
{{see also|Recurring segments on The Colbert Report}}
Typically, Colbert starts each episode with teasers regarding the show's topics and guest, each headline structured to be a deliberate pun, followed by a verbal [[metaphor]] that promotes the show&mdash;for example, "Go out ten yards and [[American football plays#Hook|button-hook]] to the left. I'm going to hit you with a perfect spiral of the truth. This is ''The Colbert Report''." The show's opening title sequence begins with images of flag waving, eagles, Colbert striking poses and words describing Colbert flying by, some of which that have been used as The W<U+00F8>rd. Originally, the last word was ''Grippy'', but it has changed to, among others, "''Megamerican''," "''Lincolnish''," "''Superstantial''," "''Freem''," "''Eneagled''," "''Flagaphile''," "''Warrior-Poet''," "''Good''," "''Gutly''," "''President Bush, Have A Hot Dog With Me''," "''Self-Evident''," "''Multi-Grain''," "''Factose Intolerant''," "''Colmes-Free Since 2009''," "''Juice It!''," and currently "''Purple-Mounted''." It was changed on May 4 2009 to, "''346x''" but returned to ''Purple-Mounted'' on May 5 2009. (The change to ''346x'' was among many hints in the episode planted by [[J. J. Abrams]] about when and where Colbert will be in the [[Persian Gulf]].)." The sequence ends with a computer-generated shrieking eagle swooping toward the foreground.

Following the opening sequence, Colbert proceeds a run-through of the day's headlines, similar to that of ''The Daily Show'' but with a pseudo-[[right-wing politics|right-wing]] spin. The program proper then begins with Colbert addressing a specific topic. That topic will usually lead into a "The W<U+00F8>rd" segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody on ''The O'Reilly Factor'''s "Talking Points Memo";<ref>{{cite news | first = Ryan | last = Nolan | title = Mock News Becomes Very Real Success | url = http://www.longislandpress.com/?cp=224&show=article&a_id=10293 | publisher = [[Long Island Press]] | date = 2006-11-16 | accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> though on occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone having to do with the topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of [[Recurring segments on The Colbert Report|recurring segments]], which may include "[[Better Know a District]]," in which Colbert interviews a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from a certain district of the United States; "Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger," in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; "Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.," a health segment; and "The ThreatDown," in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others.

Sometimes, there is a "''Colbert Report Special Repor-t''" (final "t" pronounced with special emphasis), in which Colbert devotes a section of an episode, and sometimes the entire episode to a special subject. The third segment is almost always an interview with a celebrity guest, often an author or government official.<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = 'Colbert Report' to Get Best-Of DVD | url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/wire/sns-ap-tv-colbert-dvd,0,387970.story?coll=sns-ap-tv-headlines | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071015182340/http://newsday.com/entertainment/tv/wire/sns-ap-tv-colbert-dvd,0,387970.story?coll=sns-ap-tv-headlines | archivedate=2007-10-15 | publisher = [[Newsday]] | date=  2007-07-29 | accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> The interview is, unlike ''The Daily Show'', conducted at a different table on the set. Viewers applaud as Colbert hammily jogs from his desk to the interview area, where his guest awaits. At times, Colbert will give [[high five]]s to the front row of his audience as they stand and clap. This is different from the traditional format, in which the guest enters to applause and joins the already seated host. Afterwards, Colbert ends the show by giving some parting words to the audience.

=== Set ===

[[File:Colbert report.jpg|175px|thumb|right|[[Stephen Colbert|Colbert]] on the set of ''The Colbert Report''. Note the three instances of the show's title.]]
The studio in which ''The Colbert Report'' is taped, located in [[New York City|New York City's]] [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, was used for ''The Daily Show'' until July 2005. NEP Studio 54 on [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] is owned by [[NEP Broadcasting]] which is New York City's largest production facility and also owns ''The Daily Show'' set at NEP Studio 52 two blocks south on [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|52nd Street]].

The set for ''The Colbert Report'' is called "The Eagle's Nest" and reflects and facilitates Colbert's self-aggrandizing style.<ref name="Linda">{{cite news | last =Tischler | first =Linda | title =Telly Visionary | date= November 2006 | url =http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/110/telly-visionary.html | accessdate = 2008-09-02 }}</ref> The set has two main areas: the desk, from which Colbert hosts most of the show, and the guest interview area to camera right, where his guest for the evening is interviewed. Colbert's desk is in the shape of serifed C, standing for Colbert. On one wall, above an artificial fireplace, is a portrait of Colbert; it originally showed Colbert standing in front of the same mantel with another portrait of himself. On the show's first anniversary, the portrait was replaced by one of Colbert standing in front of the mantel with the first portrait above it; the original was auctioned off at a charity event<ref name="Anniversary"/> and currently hangs in the [[Sticky Fingers (restaurant)|Sticky Fingers]] restaurant in Colbert's native [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston, S.C.]]<ref name="StickyFingers">{{cite news |last = White |first = Neil |title = Colbert runs; S.C. smiles |publisher = [[The State (newspaper)|The State]] |date = 2007-10-18 |url = http://www.thestate.com/news/story/203919.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071108000714/http://www.thestate.com/news/story/203919.html |archivedate=2007-11-08}}</ref> Colbert stated that the portrait will be changed every year to add another level of depth. On October 17, 2007, the portrait was removed and replaced with a new one that followed an identical pattern, but changed Colbert's placement in the foreground.[[File:Colbertportraitpicture.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The [[Colbert portrait]] hanging on display near the bathrooms of the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]].]]

On January 16, 2008, the "3-deep" [[Colbert portrait]] was placed on display "right between the bathrooms near the 'America's Presidents' exhibit" at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in [[Washington, DC]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Colbert earns 'appropriate place' at Smithsonian | publisher =CNN | date =2008-01-17 | url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/17/people.colbert.ap/index.html?iref=newssearch | accessdate =2008-01-30}}</ref>  After first being rejected by the National Museum of American History, Colbert petitioned the Smithsonian to display his portrait, who agreed to "go along with the joke", though they stressed that it was only temporary. Colbert said "I don't mean to brag, but as it contains three portraits, my portrait has more portraits than any other portrait in the National Portrait Gallery!" The portrait was then put on display at the Smithsonian until April 13. On October 16, 2008, the 3-deep portrait was officially donated to the permanent collection of the Smithsonian's American Treasures exhibit. At the end of that show, a new 5-deep portrait was unveiled, with the newest Colbert holding his newly-won Emmy with another Emmy and a Peabody by the mantle.[[File:Colbert Report studio.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Outside the studio]]

The graphics used throughout the show and the studio itself are saturated with [[United States flag|American flags]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[Captain America]]'s shield, and other patriotic imagery.<ref>{{cite web | publisher =Studio Daily | title =Verb! brands The Colbert Report | date=  2005-10-28 | url =http://www.studiodaily.com/main/news/f/projects/5614.html | accessdate = 2008-09-02 }}</ref> The set contains many references to Colbert, and on the show's first episode he pointed out several examples: his name, initials and the name of the show appear on the desk's plasma screen, on the rafters above the desk, and the desk itself is shaped like a giant "C".<ref name="Linda"/> In an interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Colbert explained that much of the design for the set was inspired by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]''. "All the architecture of that room points at [[Jesus]]' head, the entire room is a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]", Colbert said. "On the set, I'd like the lines of the set to converge on my head. And so if you look at the design, it all does, it all points at my head...there's a sort of [[solar deity|sun-god]] burst quality about the set around me."<ref name="avclub" /> On the floor to the front stage right of his desk there is an eagle's nest, and a tape outline of where he injured his wrist, akin to those seen at murder scenes on television police procedurals.

For the week of April 14 through April 17, 2008, the program was taped at the [[Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] campus, in advance of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] primary in that state on April 22. This was the first time the program has been taped outside its regular New York City studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weprin|first=Alex|title=Comedy Central<U+2019>s The Colbert Report Hitting the Road|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6542273.html?rssid=193|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=2008-03-18|accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref>

=== Writers' strike ===

Production of new episodes was suspended on November 5, 2007 due to the [[2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike|Writers Guild of America strike]], although a live untaped performance called ''The Colbert Report - On Strike!'' took place on December 3, 2007, with proceeds going towards show staffers.<ref name="On Strike!">{{cite news|last=Weprin|first=Alex|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6509106.html?industryid=47168|title=WGA Strike Coverage: Colbert Report Plans Live Performance|publisher=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=2007-12-04|accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref> The show returned on January 7, 2008, without the writing staff. Upon the show's return, Colbert modified the pronunciation of the show's name, using hard 't's ({{IPA|/<U+02C8>ko<U+028A>lb<U+0259>rt r<U+0259>p<U+0254>rt/}}); a similar move was made by ''The Daily Show'' which returned to air as ''[[A Daily Show]]''. On February 13, in honor of the end of the strike, the original names of both shows were restored.

During the strike, Colbert stopped performing the customary "table of contents" that usually precedes the opening titles, as well as other regular written segments such as The W<U+00F8>rd. As a member of the [[Writers Guild of America, East|Writers Guild of America]], Colbert was barred from writing any material for the show himself which his writers would ordinarily write.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Daily Show to return in January |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7155335.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> As a result, Colbert conducted more guest interviews, although several people turned down invitations to cross the picket line to appear on the show, including [[Katrina van den Heuvel]] and [[Naomi Klein]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Felix Gillette | publisher =[[The New York Observer]] | title =Author Naomi Klein Says 'No' to The Colbert Report | date= 2008-01-04 | url =http://www.observer.com/2008/author-naomi-klein-also-says-no-colbert-report | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref> At one stage, pitched as an effort to fill time on the show, Colbert lashed out at fellow late night host [[Conan O'Brien]], who had also recently returned to air without his writers, for claiming to have elevated the popularity&mdash;or "made"&mdash;presidential candidate [[Mike Huckabee]], which Colbert's character had frequently claimed credit for in the past. In response, [[Jon Stewart]], Colbert's former ''Daily Show'' colleague, claimed that he had introduced O'Brien to the public on [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and thus, by his logic, ''Stewart'' was responsible for Huckabee's success. This sparked a briefly recurring [[Who Made Huckabee?|mock feud]] between Colbert, O'Brien, and Stewart<U+2014>during which they appeared on each other's shows<U+2014>which culminated in a three-way brawl on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on February 4, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Who Created Huckabee?

== Stephen Colbert (character) ==

[[File:Colbertreport.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Stephen Colbert]] as the [[Stephen Colbert (character)|fictional Stephen Colbert]]]]
{{main|Stephen Colbert (character)}}
The Stephen Colbert character is a fictional character portrayed by comedian and actor Stephen Colbert. The character is a caricature of news pundits such as [[Stone Phillips]], [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Sean Hannity]], and [[Geraldo Rivera]], whose shows focus on "bluster and personality".<ref name=newsweek2 /><ref name="USATodayLevin"/> Colbert's character, a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot", is [[right-wing]], [[egomania]]cal, fact-averse ("factose intolerant"), God-fearing, and super-[[patriotic]]. He claims to be an [[independent (voter)|independent]] who is often mistaken for a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], but uniformly despises [[Modern American liberalism|liberals]] and generally agrees with the actions and decisions of [[George W. Bush]] and the Republican Party. This is evidenced by one of the questions that he asks of many of his guests: "George W. Bush: great President, or the ''greatest'' President?"<ref>{{cite news | publisher =Boston Globe | title =Interview with Barney Frank | date= 2005-11-10 | url =http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/11/10/the_interviews/?page=2 | accessdate =2007-07-29 }}</ref>

The character's self-aggrandizing style includes frequent promotion of an extensive range of fictional merchandising and products, including perfumes, [[science fiction|sci-fi]] novels, medications, his own "[[semen|man seed]]", and other products, all of which are either produced or endorsed by Colbert. He has also convinced his viewers, whom he addresses as "the Colbert Nation", to vote for him in various public naming polls: the mascot of the [[Saginaw Spirit]], an [[Ontario Hockey League]] team has been named after him.<ref name="ABC12Spirit">{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=news/sports&id=4615914 |title=Spirit notch victory, unveil mini-mascot |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2008-09-02 |publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC12.com]]}}</ref>

Colbert's character also holds a recurring grudge against everything [[France|French]], including their [[language]]. Ironically, he repeatedly pronounces the "Report" in "The Colbert Report" with a silent T in the traditional French accent. This faux-French way of pronouncing "Report" has started a trend amongst other [[American journalists]], such as [[Bobby Dunbar]], of [[The Colorado Rap Report]]. In an interview on NPR's "Fresh Air" Colbert acknowledged the pronunciation of report referring to the word "rapport": A close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned understand each other's feelings or ideas and communicate well.

Colbert's character has been described as a "caustic right-wing bully".<ref name="NYMag1016"/> On the interview segment of the show, Colbert frequently attempts to nail his guest by using various [[rhetorical device]]s, and often [[logical fallacy|logical fallacies]], to prove them wrong.<ref name="nprgross"/> Despite his bluster, Colbert's character suffers from [[wikt:arctophobia|arctophobia]], the [[phobia|fear]] of [[bear]]s, which he refers to as "giant, marauding, godless killing machines".<ref name="Fox News">{{cite news | publisher =[[Fox News]] | title =Stephen Colbert Enters the No Spin Zone name | date= 2007-01-19 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,244882,00.html | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref> This bear phobia was inspired by Colbert's real-life fear of bears as a child.<ref name="nprgross">{{cite interview|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5040948| title=Bluster and Satire: Stephen Colbert's 'Report'| last=Colbert |first=Stephen |interviewer=[[Terry Gross]] |program=Fresh Air | date=[[2005-12-07]] |callsign=WHYY| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Colbert refers to Bill O'Reilly as "Papa Bear", a title with a double meaning, considering Colbert's fear of bears.<ref>{{cite news | last =Sheppard | first =Noel | title =Bill O<U+2019>Reilly Meets Stephen Colbert | date= 2007-02-19 | url =http://www.newsbusters.org/node/10248 | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref> Colbert displays fear and suspicion of nearly any animal and is quick to declare they are "training" to attack humanity. He is also highly distrustful of technology, particularly robots.<ref name="murph"/> Over the months of May and June in 2007, Colbert begged [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] to give him a free [[iPhone]], and finally received one in July.

''The Colbert Report'' presents various recurring themes that help define the show.

{{main|Truthiness}}
In "The W<U+00F8>rd" segment of the first episode of the ''Report'', Colbert featured the term ''truthiness'', defined as "the quality by which one purports to know something emotionally or instinctively, without regard to evidence or intellectual examination". Colbert said that, "I don't trust books, they're all fact, no heart. And that's exactly what's pulling our country apart today. Let's face it folks, we are a divided nation<U+2026>between those who think with their head and those who know with their heart."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=24039|title=Truthiness|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2005-10-17|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> In December 2005, ''The New York Times'' selected ''truthiness'' as one of nine words that captured the [[zeitgeist]] of the year, and in January 2006, the [[American Dialect Society]] announced that ''truthiness'' was selected as its 2005 Word of the Year.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.americandialect.org/Words_of_the_Year_2005.pdf| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080227151922/http://www.americandialect.org/Words_of_the_Year_2005.pdf| archivedate=2008-02-27|date=2006-01-06| title=Truthiness Voted 2005 Word of the Year by American Dialect Society| format=PDF| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

Colbert has made frequent reference to the spread of the word ''truthiness'' since he introduced it, while carping on media accounts of ''truthiness'' that neglect to identify him as its source.<ref name="Peyser"/> ''Truthiness'' has since been discussed, sometimes repeatedly, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[MSNBC]], [[National Public Radio]], the [[Associated Press]], ''[[Editor & Publisher]]'', ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', [[ABC NewsRadio]]'s ''Word Watch'' with Kel Richards and ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'', and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. In January 2006, ''truthiness'' was featured as a Word of the Week by the website of the [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] English Dictionary.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060213-truthiness.htm| title = Word of the Week Archive:Truthiness| last = Maxwell|first= Kerry| accessdate = 2008-09-02| work = Macmillan English Dictionary|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]}}</ref> In December of the same year, [[Merriam-Webster]] announced that "truthiness" had been voted by visitors to its website to be the #1 Word of the Year for 2006.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/06words.htm| title = Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year 2006| accessdate = 2008-09-02| work = Merriam-Webster Online|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}</ref> On August 27, 2006, the ''[[Global Language Monitor]]'' named ''truthiness'' and ''wikiality''<U+2014>both coined by Colbert on ''The Colbert Report''<U+2014>as the top television buzzwords of 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=televisionNews&storyID=2006-08-27T165048Z_01_N27277446_RTRIDST_0_TELEVISION-EMMYS-WORDS-DC.XML | title="Truthiness", "Wikiality" named TV words of year|publisher=Reuters |date=2006-08-27 | accessdate=2006-08-28}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/?page_id=20 | title='Truthiness' and 'Wikiality' Named Top Television Buzzwords of 2006 Followed by 'Katrina', 'Katie,' and 'Dr. McDreamy' | publisher=[[Global Language Monitor]] |date=2006-08-27 | accessdate=2008-09-02 }}</ref> It was used in [[The New York Times crossword puzzle]] in June 2008,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2008/06/saturday-jun-14-2008-brendan-emmett.html | work=Rex Parker does the NYT crossword puzzle (personal blog) | title=Saturday, Jun. 14, 2008 | author=Parker, Rex | date=2008-06-14 | accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> which Colbert himself mentioned during an exchange with Jon Stewart on an episode of ''The Daily Show''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=173998 | title=The Daily Show Full Episode | date=2008-06-18 | work=Comedy Central | format=video | accessdate=2008-08-22 }}</ref>

=== Relation to ''The O'Reilly Factor'' ===
[[File:colbertoreilly.jpg|225px|thumb|right|[[Stephen Colbert]] appears as a guest on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. January 18, 2007.]]

The Stephen Colbert character and ''The Colbert Report'' are generally parodies of [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' respectively. New episodes of ''The Colbert Report'' are scheduled in the same time slot as rebroadcasts of ''The O'Reilly Factor'', while ''Colbert'' rebroadcasts are scheduled during new ''O'Reilly'' shows.<ref name=showing>{{cite news | first = Nicholas | last = Lemann | title = Fear Factor | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/27/060327fa_fact | format = Free | work = [[The New Yorker]] | date = 2006-03-20 | accessdate = 2008-09-02}}</ref> When O'Reilly appeared on ''The Daily Show'' before the second episode of ''The Colbert Report'' aired, he commented, "Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after you making fun of me?", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'.<ref name=dowd>{{cite news|first=Maureen|last=Dowd|authorlink=Maureen Dowd|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors/page/3|title=America's Anchors|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=2006-11-16|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref name="charlestonian">{{cite news|url=http://colbertsheroes.org/articles/CharlestonPost-Apr29-06.shtml|title=Great Charlestonian? ... Or the Greatest Charlestonian?|first=Bryce|last=Donovan|publisher=The Charleston Post and Courier|date=2006-04-29|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> In a subsequent ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview, O'Reilly said that he "feels it's a compliment" to have Colbert parody him because Colbert "isn't mean-spirited" and does not "use [his] platform to injure people". Later, Colbert replied on-air, "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist."<ref name=newsweek2 />

''The Colbert Report'' features a commentary segment called "The W<U+00F8>rd", similar to O'Reilly's "Talking Points Memo". Like the Memo, The W<U+00F8>rd features the commentator asserting a political point of view with a text screen graphic next to him. However, while O'Reilly's text serves to emphasize his points, Colbert's text generally serves as an ironic counterpoint to his character's position. Other segments that can be juxtaposed with ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' are The Colbert Report's ''Inbox'' (compared to O'Reilly's "Factor Mail"); ''Stephen Colbert's Balls for Kidz'' which, unlike The Factor's "Children at Risk", tends to portray messages and lessons typically considered unsuitable for children; and ''That's The Craziest F#?king Thing I've Ever Heard'', which is comparable to O'Reilly's "The Most Ridiculous Item of the Day". Additionally, Colbert parodies O'Reilly's references to his program as the "no spin zone" by inviting viewers of his show to "take a spin in the no fact zone".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nofactzone.net/?page_id=2|title=About Us|publisher=No Fact Zone|date=2006-06-16|accessdate= 2008-09-02}}</ref> O'Reilly and Colbert each appeared as a guest on the other's show on January 18, 2007. As a souvenir, Colbert "stole" a microwave from the O'Reilly green room<U+2014>in fact, he informed O'Reilly of his intention to take the microwave beforehand<U+2014>later displaying it on his own show. He later sent over a replacement microwave, emblazoned with ''The Colbert Report'' logo.)

=== Green Screen challenges ===

On the August 10, 2006 episode, Stephen Colbert was shown wielding a [[lightsaber]] in front of a [[chroma key|green screen]], a parody of the [[Star Wars Kid]] internet phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web | last =Wu | first =Annie | title =Stephen Colbert's green screen challenge has a winner! | date =2006-10-12 | url =http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/12/stephen-colberts-green-screen-challenge-has-a-winner/ | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref> This was done as part of the "Better Know A District" segment, when Colbert visited [[California's 6th congressional district]], the home of [[Star Wars]] creator [[George Lucas]]. The greenscreen footage was subsequently edited by fans and their results were posted on the [[Internet]], primarily the website [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web | last= McCarthy | first=Caroline | title =Colbert announces Green Screen Challenge winner | date =2006-10-13 | url =http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6125803-7.html | accessdate =2007-07-28 }}</ref> Colbert featured some of these clips on the August 21 episode and issued the "Green Screen Challenge" to the public<U+2014>a contest to create the best video from footage shown in the August 10 episode. Lucas himself made an appearance on the October 11 episode to showcase his own entry.<ref name="Anniversary">{{cite news | agency =Associated Press|publisher=[[MSNBC]] | title =<U+2018>Colbert Report<U+2019> celebrates first anniversary | date =2006-10-16 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15317952/ | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref>

When [[indie rock]] band [[The Decemberists]] shot a [[music video]] for their single "[[O Valencia!]]" in front of a green screen and asked fans to complete the video, Colbert accused them of copying his idea, and started his second green screen challenge, which called for fans to edit Stephen Colbert into The Decemberists unfinished music video. In response, The Decemberists challenged Colbert to a [[guitar]] solo challenge.<ref>{{cite news | agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[MSNBC]] | title =Colbert, Decemberists rattle their light sabers | date= 2006-12-06 | url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16057198/ | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref> For a few weeks, the upcoming contest, which Colbert titled "Rock and Awe: Countdown to Guitarmageddon" ("The I-Rock War: Cut and Strum" and "[[The Iceman Cometh|The Axeman Cometh]]: [[Mourning Becomes Electra|Mourning Becomes Electric]]" were announced as alternate titles; Colbert added that he would find and fire the English major on his staff who created the latter title), became a focus of the show. On December 20, 2006, [[Chris Funk]], lead guitarist for The Decemberists, came on the show for the guitar solo challenge. Once Funk finished playing, Colbert arrived on stage with a five-necked guitar belonging to [[Rick Nielsen]] of [[Cheap Trick]]. Colbert played two notes, pretended to cut his hand, and insisted that he could no longer play, so [[Peter Frampton]] played a solo in Colbert's place. A panel of three judges, then [[New York]] [[governor]] [[Eliot Spitzer]], Rock critic [[Anthony DeCurtis]], and chairman of the [[Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music]] at [[New York University]], Jim Anderson, voted to determine the best solo. DeCurtis voted for the Colbert/Frampton team, Anderson voted for Funk, and Spitzer withdrew himself from judging as Colbert tried to [[bribe]] him during the commercial break. The deciding vote was given to [[Henry Kissinger]], who had briefly appeared earlier in the show. Kissinger said that the American people had won, at which point Colbert declared himself the winner.<ref name="USAtoday">{{cite news | agency =Associated Press|publisher=[[USA Today]] | title =Colbert slays Decemberists in Shred Off | date=2006-12-21 | url =http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-12-21-colbert-contest_x.htm | accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref> As a prize, Colbert received ''[[The Crane Wife]]'', The Decemberists' new album, saying "The Crane Wife by the Decemberists? I love the Decemberists, they rock. In your face, Funk!"

On June 12, 2008, Stephen announced his third green screen challenge, "Stephen Colbert's Make McCain Exciting Challenge!", in which he invited viewers to replace the [[chroma key|green screen]] behind [[John McCain]] during one of his speeches with something more exciting. The show would display entries on a semi-regular basis for the next two months.

On September 5, 2008, Colbert issued a follow up McCain green screen challenge.  He challenged his viewers to alter the footage of McCain's acceptance speech, while Colbert himself took a one week hiatus.

=== Wrist violence and fictional addiction ===

On July 26, 2007, Colbert broke his left wrist while performing his warm-up for the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=90524|title=Stephen's Wrist|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-07-26|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Following the accident Colbert launched a new section of the show entitled "Wrist Watch", featuring news stories about wrists during which the character attacks what he sees as [[Hollywood]]'s glamorization of "wrist violence".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=91798|title=Steven Seagal and Wrist Snuff|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-08-20|accessdate=2007-08-21}}</ref> On August 8, Colbert debuted the "Wriststrong" [[wrist band]], based on [[Lance Armstrong]]'s "[[Livestrong wristband|Livestrong]]" wrist band, in a hope to increase wrist awareness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=91153|title=Wrist Watch - WristStrong|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2007-08-10}}</ref> The wristbands were made available for purchase online and Colbert ordered those wearing the bracelets to give them to anyone they meet who is more famous than themselves.  Colbert has subsequently attempted to pass on bracelets to well-known media figures including [[Katie Couric]] (Stephen gave a Wriststrong bracelet to Katie and she said that she would wear it on air, but didn't), [[Brian Williams]] and [[Matt Lauer]].  All proceeds raised by the sales of the wrist bands are given to the [[Yellow Ribbon Fund]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=91799|title=WristStrong Bracelets|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-08-20|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>  On January 23, 2008, Colbert interviewed the head of the Yellow Ribbon Fund, Marie Wood, and presented her a check for the money raised by WristStrong bracelet sales to date, totaling US$171,525, the profits of over 30,000 bracelet sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=147829|title=Marie Wood|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2008-01-23|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

Colbert had a number of well-known figures autograph his cast, including [[Michael Bloomberg]], [[Mayor]] of [[New York City]]; ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' anchor [[Katie Couric]]; Bill O'Reilly, host of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s ''The O'Reilly Factor''; [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives]]; [[Tim Russert]], host of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet The Press]]''; [[Tony Snow]], former [[White House Press Secretary]]; and ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' anchor [[Brian Williams]]. On August 23 the cast was removed on air,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=91489|title=Rove Resigns|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-08-13|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> and it was announced that Colbert would auction off his cast for the Yellow Ribbon Fund on [[eBay]]. The auction began after that evening's show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Luczak|first=Renata|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2007/082207_colbert_yellowribbon_fund.jhtml|title=Stephen Colbert to announce the eBay auction of his celebrity-signed cast|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-08-22|date=2007-08-23}}</ref> Within minutes of the auction's start, bidding quickly rose to over [[United States dollar|US$]]71,000. However, many bids were canceled because bidders failed to get pre-approved by the seller (which was required in the auction). It was sold for US$17,200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=290153546119|title=Stephen Colbert: Exclusive Cast|publisher=[[eBay]]|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2004-08-24}}{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}</ref>

While Colbert's wrist was in the cast, the character began taking (and subsequently became addicted to) painkillers to deal with his injury, frequently taking absurd doses and displaying exaggerated [[withdrawal]] symptoms of irritability and [[hallucination]]s when they were denied. The cast was removed on television, after which ''The Report'' went on a brief hiatus, and following its return on September 10, Colbert claimed that, with help from a court order and rehab over the break, he had kicked his addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/videos.jhtml?videoId=102500|title=Updates|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2007-09-10|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref>

=== Recurring characters ===
{{main|List of The Colbert Report characters}}

While the show is largely dominated by Colbert, there are a number of recurring characters who appear periodically.  Colbert will frequently address the show's director, Jimmy<U+2014>a reference to real-life ''Colbert Report'' director Jim Hoskinson<U+2014>and will sometimes converse with him. On the rare occasions Jimmy has appeared on screen, he has been portrayed by staff writer [[Peter Gwinn]]. Building manager Tad, portrayed by [[Paul Dinello]], has appeared on the show multiple times to host special segments. Other recurring members of Colbert's fictional staff have included Meg the intern (played by [[Meg DeFrancesco]]), Bobby the stage manager (played by [[Eric Drysdale]]) and Killer (uncredited). Colbert himself has portrayed his character's Cuban [[alter ego]], Esteban Colberto; and his Chinese alter ego, Ching Chong Ding Dong.

Early in the show's run, Stephen occasionally encountered Russ Lieber, a liberal media personality character portrayed by [[David Cross]].  [[Tim Meadows]] has also appeared on the show as P.K. Winsome, a black Republican and hucksterish entrepreneur.

An inanimate character was created in response to [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling to lift the Washington, D.C. gun ban. Sweetness is a black [[pistol]] that Colbert claims he can hear talking to him. He will often converse with Sweetness by holding the gun up to his ear and then relaying what it has supposedly said.

Colbert has also voiced [[Wilford Brimley]] in false phone conversations. Gorlock, Colbert's alien financial adviser, is another recurring character mentioned on the show.

== Reception ==

''The Colbert Report'' drew an unusual amount of media attention prior to its premiere. It was featured in articles in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]'' and ''[[Fresh Air]]'', [[CNN]], and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. ''[[The New York Times]]'' alone ran three articles on the ''Report'' before its debut, and has made repeated references to ''The Colbert Report'' since then.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/04/arts/television/04come.html| title='Daily Show's Personality Gets His Own Platform| first=Jacques| last=Steinberg| date=2005-05-04| publisher=New York Times| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> [[Maureen Dowd]], for instance, referred to Colbert's "Dead To Me" board as a metaphor in her column, saying that [[Oprah Winfrey]] "should take a page from Stephen Colbert and put the slippery [[James Frey]] on her 'Dead to me' list".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/opinion/14dowd.html| title=Oprah!

''The Colbert Report'' drew 1.13 million viewers for its premiere episode, 47 percent greater than the average for that time slot over the previous four weeks, and 98 percent of the viewership of ''The Daily Show'', which has Comedy Central's second-largest viewership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/servlet/an/comedy/2/20051108/TCN_PR_20051108/?hub=ComedyReleases|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061012152228/http://www.thecomedynetwork.ca/servlet/an/comedy/2/20051108/TCN_PR_20051108/?hub=ComedyReleases|archivedate=2006-10-12| title= "Canada, You're on Notice!"| date=2005-11-08| publisher=[[The Comedy Network]]| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Averaged over its opening week, ''The Report'' had 1.2 million viewers per episode, more than double the average for the same time the previous year, when the time slot was occupied by ''[[Too Late with Adam Carolla]]''. The premiere week of ''The Colbert Report'' also coincided with the second-highest-rated week of ''The Daily Show'', behind the week leading up to the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tv.zap2it.com/tveditorial/tve_main/1%2C1002%2C271%7C98227%7C1%7C%2C00.html| title=

''The Colbert Report'' rapidly became an internet phenomenon, with a vast number of clips from the show being posted onto [[YouTube]] by fans. Subsequently references to YouTube were made in jokes on the show, which also launched the first "[[#Greenscreen challenges|green screen challenge]]". On October 27, 2006, however, [[Comedy Central]] asserted its copyright over ''The Colbert Report'' clips, and YouTube removed all clips over 5 minutes in length. In February 2007, at [[Viacom]]'s request, they removed all remaining ''Colbert Report'' clips. Clips of every episode of the show can now be found at [http://www.colbertnation.com/ Colbert Nation.com]<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.colbertnation.com| title=Colbertnation: The Colbert Report Official Site| accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref>

== Presented as non-satirical journalism ==
==== Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust ====

In May 2006, the [[Tom DeLay]] Legal Defense Trust posted a video of ''The Colbert Report'' on its website and sent out a mass email urging DeLay supporters to watch how "Hollywood liberal" [[Robert Greenwald]] "crashed and burned . . . when promoting his new attack on Tom DeLay."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/delay.JPG|title=Defend DeLay|publisher=Think Progress|month=May | year=2006|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> The video featured Colbert asking questions such as, "Who hates America more, you or [[Michael Moore]]?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/2006/05/24/delay-colbert/|title=Desperate for Supporters, DeLay Turns to Stephen Colbert|publisher=Think Progress|date=2006-05-24|accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> The Trust's email describes its content as "the truth behind Liberal Hollywood's" [[The Big Buy: Tom DeLay's Stolen Congress|film about DeLay]], and characterizes the ''Colbert Report'' clip with the headline, "Colbert Cracks the Story on Real Motivations Behind the Movie." On June 8, 2006, Colbert responded by conducting an "Exclusive Fake Interview" on his show with DeLay. Three different interviews with DeLay on different networks were spliced for humorous effect, and Colbert ended the "interview" by saying "I do hope you enjoyed my manipulation of your words." DeLay has since appeared as a guest on the program.

==== Robert Wexler ====

On [http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/182106/july-25-2006/morning-shows| July 25, 2006], Colbert responded to television networks<U+2014>specifically [[Fox News]], NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]''<U+2014>which took comments made by [[Florida]] Congressman [[Robert Wexler]] on ''The Colbert Report'' out of context (e.g.: "I enjoy cocaine and the company of prostitutes because they are a fun thing to do."). Wexler, who ran unopposed in the then-upcoming election, made the comments in response to urging by Colbert that he "say some things that would really lose the election for [Wexler] if [Wexler] were contested."<ref>{{cite news |agency =Associated Press |title =Rep. Wexler Vows He Was Joking When He Made Cocaine Remark |date= 2006-07-24|publisher=[[Fox News]] |url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205314,00.html |accessdate =2008-09-02 }}</ref>.  Colbert effectively criticized the major networks' morning news shows that featured the interview in a misleading and a very negative light, by showing clips from many of the "fluff" pieces they favored instead of "real" news. Colbert subsequently told his viewers to "vote Wexler, the man's got a sense of humor, unlike, evidently, journalists."

== Awards ==

In 2006, ''The Colbert Report'' was nominated for four [[Emmy]]s, one more than its parent, ''[[The Daily Show]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/downloads/images/2006emmys/PrimetimeNoms.php |title=The 58th Primetime Emmy Awards and Creative Arts Emmys Nominations |publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=2008-09-02 |date=2006-08-27}}</ref> However, ''The Colbert Report'' lost two of its Emmy opportunities to ''The Daily Show''<U+2014>Colbert received one as a then-member of ''The Daily Show'''s writing staff. Colbert also lost Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program to [[Barry Manilow]], who was nominated for a one-time [[PBS]] special, as Colbert jokingly noted while presenting an Emmy later that night. Manilow later appeared on the show to sign a peace treaty with Colbert, in which they agreed to [[joint custody]] of the award. The two then sang a duet of Manilow's song "[[I Write the Songs]]".

The show was nominated for:

* Outstanding Directing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Program, Episode #110
* Outstanding Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program, Stephen Colbert
* [[Outstanding Variety, Music Or Comedy Series]]
* Outstanding Writing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Program

Additionally, the show was nominated for two [[Television Critics Association]] Awards:<ref name=awards>{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458254/awards |title=Awards for "The Colbert Report" (2005) | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> Outstanding Individual Achievement in Comedy (Stephen Colbert), and Outstanding New Program of the Year.

==== Other honors ====

Colbert has received several other honors and distinctions. Colbert announced on his March 28, 2006 show that he had been contacted by [[San Francisco Zoo]] officials seeking his permission to name an unhatched [[bald eagle]] after him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/31/DDGU9GJ5T21.DTL |title=Leah Garchik |last=Garchik |first=Leah |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2006-03-31 |accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref> The eagle, affectionately dubbed Stephen Jr. on ''The Report'', was bred to be reintroduced into the wild, as a part of the zoo's California Bald Eagle Breeding Program. Colbert celebrated the chick's birth on the April 17, 2006, program, and has since given updates on the bird's development. He has criticized the bird for migrating to Canada, and has attempted to lure him back to the U.S. On December 24, 2008, Stephen Jr. (tag A-46) was photographed at the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge on the California/Oregon border.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008568404_colberteagle29m.html A Colbert report: Bald eagle Stephen Jr. sighted in Oregon | Seattle Times Newspaper]</ref>

On June 24, 2008, [[Jason Bond|Dr. Jason Bond]], an associate [[professor]] with the Department of [[Biology]] at [[East Carolina University]], appeared on the show because he agreed to name a trapdoor spider after Stephen Colbert.

{{main|I Am America (And So Can You!)}}

A "pure extension" of the show in book form, titled ''I Am America (And So Can You!)'', was released on October 9, 2007. Written by Stephen Colbert and ''The Colbert Report'' writers, the book covers Colbert's opinions on a wide array of topics that he has no time to address on the show. Red [[margin]] notes appear throughout the book, providing humorous reactions and counterpoints to Colbert's arguments in a style comparable to the ''Report'''s W<U+00F8>rd segment. The book draws some influence from the literary endeavors of the character's pundit models, such as [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' (2000) and [[Sean Hannity]]'s ''[[Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism|Deliver Us From Evil]]'' (2004), which Colbert says he "forced" himself to read as a reference.<ref>[[Stephen Colbert|Colbert, Stephen]] (October 16, 2007).
