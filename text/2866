'''Canon law''' is the body of laws and regulations made by or adopted by ecclesiastical authority, for the government of the Christian organization and its members. It is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglican Communion]] of churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09056a.htm|title=Canon law|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[ecumenical council|council]] (From [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CE><U+03BD>, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / <U+05E7><U+05E0><U+05D4>, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

The Roman Catholic Church has the oldest continuously functioning legal system in [[Western world| Western Europe]],<ref>[http://canonlaw.info Canon Law @Canonlaw.info]</ref> predating the common and European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions.  What began with rules ("canons") adopted by the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] in the 1st century has blossomed into a highly complex and original legal system encapsulating not just norms of the [[New Testament]], but some elements of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]), [[Roman law|Roman]], [[Visigoths|Visigothic]], [[Saxon people|Saxon]], and [[Celt]]ic legal traditions spanning thousands of years of human experience.   

In the Roman Church, positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and [[natural law]], or changeable circumstantial and merely [[positive law]], derive formal authority and promulgation from the pope, who as [[Supreme Pontiff]] possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person.  The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but indeed all-encompassing of the human condition.

In the [[Early Christianity|early Church]], the first canons were decreed by [[bishop]]s united in "[[Ecumenical councils|Ecumenical]]" councils (the Emperor summoning all of the known world's bishops to attend with at least the acknowledgement of the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]) or "local" councils (bishops of a region or territory).  Over time, these canons were supplemented with [[decretal]]s of the Bishops of Rome, which were responses to doubts or problems according to the maxim, "''Roma locuta est, causa finita est''" ("Rome has spoken, case is closed").  

Later, they were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official.  The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the [[Camaldolese]] monk [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the 11th century, commonly known as the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' ("Gratian's Decree").  Pope [[Gregory IX]] is credited with promulgating the first official collection of canons called the ''Decretalia Gregorii Noni'' or ''Liber Extra'' (1234).  This was followed by the ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]], the ''Clementines'' (1317) of [[Clement V]], the ''[[Extravagantes Joannis XXII]]'' and the ''[[Extravagantes Communes]]'', all of which followed the same structure as the Liber Extra.  All these collections, with the [[Decretum Gratiani]], are together referred to as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. After the completion of the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'', subsequent [[papal]] legislation was published in periodic volumes called ''[[Bullarium|Bullaria]]''.

By the 19th Century, this body of legislation included some 10,000 norms. Many these were difficult to reconcile with one another due to changes in circumstances and practice.  This situation impelled [[Pope St. Pius X]] to order the creation of the first [[Code of Canon Law]], a single volume of clearly stated laws.  Under the aegis of the Cardinal [[Pietro Gasparri]], the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law was completed under [[Benedict XV]], who promulgated the Code, effective in 1918.  The work having been begun by Pius X, it was sometimes called the "Pio-Benedictine Code" but more often the 1917 Code.  In its preparation, centuries of material was examined, scrutinized for authenticity by leading experts, and harmonized as much as possible with opposing canons and even other Codes, from the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]] to the [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:CIC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the ''1917 Code of Canon Law '' .]]
[[Pope John XXIII]] initially called for a [[Synod]] of the Diocese of Rome, an [[Ecumenical Council]], and an updating to the 1917 Code.  After the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Ecumenical Council]] of the Vatican (Vatican II) closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II.  After multiple drafts and many years of discussion, [[Pope John Paul II]] promulgated the revised Code of Canon Law (CIC) in 1983. Containing 1752 canons, it is the law currently binding on the Latin (western) Roman Church.

The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] promulgated in 1990 by [[Pope John Paul II]].
The institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[Common law]] bear the influences of canon law.  Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon law, says that canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.

Currently, all Roman Catholic seminary students are expected to take courses in canon law (c. 252.3).  Some ecclesiastical officials are required to have the doctorate ([[JCD]]) or at least the licentiate ([[Licentiate of Canon Law|JCL]]) in canon law in order to fulfill their functions:  Judicial Vicars (c. 1419.1), Judges (c. 1421.3), Promoters of Justice (c. 1435), Defenders of the Bond (c. 1435).  In addition, [[Vicars General]] and Episcopal Vicars are to be doctors or at least licensed in canon law or theology (c. 478.1), and canonical advocates must either have the doctorate or be truly expert in canon law (c. 1483).  Ordinarily, Bishops are to have advanced degrees in sacred scripture, theology, or canon law (c. 378.1.5). St. [[Raymond of Penyafort]] (1175-1275), a Spanish Dominican priest, is the patron saint of canonists, due to his important contributions to the science of Canon Law.

== Orthodox Churches ==<!-- This section is linked from [[New Testament]] -->

The Greek-speaking Orthodox have collected canons and commentaries upon them in a work known as the ''P<U+0113>d<U+00E1>lion'' (Greek: <U+03A0><U+03B7><U+03B4><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD>, "Rudder"), so named because it is meant to "steer" the Church. The Orthodox Christian tradition in general treats its canons more as guidelines than as laws, the [[economy (Eastern Orthodox Church)|bishops adjusting them]] to cultural and other local circumstances. Some Orthodox canon scholars point out that, had the [[Ecumenical Councils]] (which deliberated in Greek) meant for the canons to be used as laws, they would have called them ''n<U+00F3>moi/<U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03B9>'' (laws) rather than ''kan<U+00F3>nes/<U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2>'' (rules), but almost all Orthodox conform to them. The dogmatic decisions of the Councils, though, are to be obeyed rather than to be treated as guidelines, since they are essential for the Church's unity.

== Anglican Communion ==
{{main|Canon law (Anglican Communion)}}

In the [[Church of England]], the [[ecclesiastical court]]s that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g., discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards).  Their separate status dates back to the 12th century when the [[Normans]] split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other [[court]]s of England the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, not [[common law]], although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes.  Since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts.  The teaching of canon law at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; thereafter practitioners in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] were trained in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], receiving a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) degree from Oxford, or an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] from Cambridge.  Such lawyers (called "doctors" and "civilians") were centred at "[[Doctors' Commons|Doctors Commons]]", a few streets south of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]], where they monopolized [[probate]], matrimonial, and [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the [[common law]] courts in the mid-19th century.  (Admiralty law was also based on civil law instead of common law, thus was handled by the civilians too.)
[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] repealed Canon Law in 1638 after uprisings of [[Covenanter]]s confronting the Bishops of Aberdeen following the convention at [[Muchalls Castle]] and other revolts across [[Scotland]] earlier that year.

Other churches in the [[Anglican Communion]] around the world (e.g., the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]]) still function under their own private systems of canon law.

==Presbyterian and Reformed Churches==
{{main|Presbyterian polity}}
In Presbyterian and Reformed Churches, canon law is known as "practice and procedure" or  "church order," and includes the church's laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.

==Lutheranism==   
The [[Book of Concord]] is the historic [[doctrinal statement]] of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], consisting of ten [[creed|credal]] documents recognized as authoritative in [[Lutheranism]] since the 16th century.<ref>F. Bente, ed. and trans., ''Concordia Triglotta'', (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), p. i</ref>  However, the Book of Concord is a confessional document (stating orthodox belief) rather than a book of ecclesiastical rules or discipline, like canon law.  Each Lutheran national church establishes its own system of church order and discipline, though these are referred to as "canons."

==The United Methodist Church==

The [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]] contains the laws, rules, policies and guidelines for The United Methodist Church.  Its last edition was published in 2008.
