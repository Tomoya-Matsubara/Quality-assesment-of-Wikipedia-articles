[[File:Lottie Moon House - Present.jpg|thumb|Main fa<U+00E7>ade of the Lottie Moon House - 2011]]
==History==
The [[Lottie Moon]] House, which is located at 220 East High Street in [[Oxford, Ohio]] was completed in 1831. It was not named Lottie Moon House, but rather adopted the name after being inhabited by the Moon family in 1839. The nineteenth century [[architecture]] is a simple design enhanced by a one story wooden [[porch]] that spans most of the entire front of the home. The front of the home is [[symmetrical]] which adds to its simple beauty.

The Lottie Moon House is part of the historic [[neighborhood]] that surrounds [[Miami University]]. The home was built for [[residence]], but after Lottie Moon became famous for being a [[Confederate]] Spy, the home was deemed of historic importance, and it was donated to Miami University to be apart of their campus.
==Lottie Moon==
Cynthia Charlotte Moon, fondly known as Lottie, was a young girl when her family moved into the residency at 220 East High Street. Lottie became famous as a Confederate [[Spy]]. She rode the battle lines in the South in [[President Abraham Lincoln]]'s personal [[carriage]]. Lottie was disguised as "Lady Hull", a [[rheumatic]] English [[invalid]]. She pretended to be asleep while President Lincoln and [[Secretary of War]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], discussed upcoming strategies.

The two [[Union]] men believed that they were taking Lady Hull to the South for a [[hot springs | warm springs]] treatment for her sickness. Little did they know they were delivering the infamous Confederate Spy, Lottie Moon, into the expectant hands of [[Jefferson Davis]].

Stanton offered $10,000 for the capture of Lottie Moon after realizing Lady Hull was Lottie Moon.

==Past Residents==
The Moon family was the first and most famous family to reside at 220 East High Street. [[Robert Moon]], Lottie's father, moved his family into the home in 1839, and they lived as a family in the home until 1849. In 1849, Robert Moon offered the home as a gift to Lottie upon the announcement of her [[engagement]] to [[James Clark]]. However, Lottie moved to the South to be closer to the [[Civil War | war]] and better able to relay messages.

Dr. John Hall, president of Miami University from 1855 to 1866, moved into the home with his family. They lived in this home until his [[resignation]] from presidency.

Sutton C. Richey bought the home from Milo Sawyer in 1873. Richey was a [[druggist]]. His wife, Rella, and their three children lived in the home. Richey had a practice in the McCullough Building located at 20 East High Street from 1859 until 1891. When Mr. Richey died, Rella lived in the home with their daughter, Jeannie, until Rella's son, Samuel Webster Richey, took the home for himself. He passed it on to his son. It was upon the death of Samuel Webster Richey Jr. that the home was donated to Miami University by his sons.
