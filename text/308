'''''Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages''''' is a 1996 [[science fiction]] [[adventure game]] developed by Epic Multimedia Group and published by [[Inscape (publisher)|Inscape]].  The game propounds the [[conspiracy theory]] that all of [[human history]] is a lie and the human race's development and evolution were aided by [[extra-terrestrials]].  The player attempts to uncover the truth through the course of the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.

''Drowned God'' is based on a forged manuscript written by [[Harry Horse]] in 1983. After facing legal trouble and fines when he attempted to sell the text, Horse shelved it until playing ''[[Myst]]'' and ''[[7th Guest]]'' in the mid 1990s, whereupon he decided a [[first person video game|first person]] adventure game would be the best way to tell the manuscript's story.

Producer Algy Williams hired a team of multimedia artists and programmers to help Horse develop ''Drowned God''. Upon its release, the game sold well, but quickly faded in popularity due to bugs and a lack of patches.  ''Drowned God''{{'}}s concept and visuals were widely praised, while its gameplay, audio, and puzzles received more varied responses.  A planned sequel never came to fruition.

==Plot==
===Background===
''Drowned God'''s concept centers around the idea that human history has been manipulated to cover up certain facts.<ref name=gs-interview/>  The true history, according to the game, is that aliens from the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] area of space seeded humanity on Earth thousands of years ago and have since guided its development.<ref name=gs-preview/>  An ancient, highly developed civilization was lost millennia ago in the [[Great Flood]].<!-- gs-interview -->  The library of Alexandria housed much of what game writer [[Harry Horse]] called "forbidden knowledge" before it was destroyed.<!-- gs-interview -->  The [[Knights Templar]], whose membership included luminaries such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Isaac Newton]], preserved the information for centuries.<!-- gs-interview -->  In the 20th century, the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] opened a gateway into another dimension, first freeing the aliens Horse refers to as "the Legion".<!-- gs-interview -->  An independent government group spent the subsequent decades in contact with the aliens following the [[Roswell UFO incident]].<ref name=gs-interview/>

===Story===
The game's plot begins in a chamber containing the Bequest Globe,<!-- quandary --> a device which the player has recently inherited.  The Globe is a giant brass cylinder full of gears, fronted by a clock face made of sliding and rotating plates comprising twenty-two Roman numerals, which represent the [[Major Arcana]], with the Jewish [[Kabbalah]] in its center.  A voice welcomes the player and tells them that the Globe is a gift, then explains that the player must unlock the secret of the drowned god.

The player initially must enter their name into the device,<!-- quandary --> which then displays a series of past lives the player has lived.  The name is also converted into its [[numerology|numerological]] equivalent.<!-- quandary -->  Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called [[Kether]] and [[Malchut]], respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task.<!-- quandary -->  The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky,<ref name=quandary/> although it becomes clear they are acting in opposition to each other.<ref name=newsweek/>  Both masks refer to the player by their assigned number.

The player must enter four different worlds<ref name=boot>{{cite journal | author=Brown, Michael | work=[[Maximum PC|Boot]] | page=84 | volume=2 | year=1997 | month=February | publisher=Imagine Pub.}}</ref> through the Bequest Globe, each of which is an amalgamation of historical and fantastical elements and named after one of the [[sephirot]] on the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|kabbalistic Tree of Life]]. The player seeks to recover four lost artifacts: the Rod of [[Osiris]], the [[Holy Grail]], the [[Philosopher's Stone]], and the [[Ark of the Covenant]].<ref name=gs-preview/>  According to Horse, "The relics you're searching for are not what you think they are".<ref name=boot/>  The first world, [[Binah (Kabbalah)|Binah]], includes aspects of [[King Arthur|Arthurian legend]], including [[Morgan Le Fey]] and the [[Knights Templar]], as well as [[Stonehenge]].<!-- just -->  The second, [[Chesed]],<ref name=just/> features [[Aztec]] ruins and a [[submarine]] interior.<ref name=quandary/>  The third, [[Din (Kabbalah)|Din]],<!-- just --> centers around an underground [[transit system]], a [[steampunk]] [[carnival]], and a mechanical [[maze]].  The final world, [[Chokhmah (Kabbalah)|Chokmah]],<ref name=just/> takes place outside [[Area 51]].

Throughout the game, the player finds and uses [[Tarot]] cards<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Inscape+expands+development,+production+and+marketing+efforts%3B+10...-a018192876 | title=Inscape Expands Development, Production and Marketing Efforts | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=April 16, 1996 | accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref> to unlock new areas and gain more information about the true history of the world. Upon returning to the Bequest Globe between worlds, the player sees the Roman numerals in its display light up in relation to the cards that have been recovered. After recovering three of the lost artifacts, the player fails to recover the last one, the Ark of the Covenant, which takes the form of a [[nuclear warhead]].  The player is able to choose one of three endings, depending on whether they decide to enter a final doorway in the chambers of one of the two opposing factions represented by Kether and Malchut, or enter a new central chamber via the Bequest Globe.

Choosing either of the two doors results in an ending in which the player is trapped in a [[dystopia]]n world: either Kether's, a technological police state, or Malchut's, a society of forced genetic manipulation.  Both have ominous [[men in black]] overseeing the proceedings.  If the player instead chooses to open the central chamber, a scene with a group of [[grey aliens]] approaching is briefly shown, wherein they say, "We are coming, for we are Legion."  All three options lead to the same ending credits, which feature a voice-over describing the [[Osiris myth|murder of Osiris]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Drowned God Einstein Newton.png|thumb|left|alt=There is a pedestal in the center of a room with a sculpture of Albert Einstein's head on it, facing forward.  On the front of the pedestal is a clock-like panel with a large button labeled "NOW" in its center.  In the background, there are an image of a partially eaten apple to the left, two white doors in the center, and a chalkboard to the right.|The [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Isaac Newton]] dialogue puzzle, described as "brilliant" by critics<ref name=just/><ref name=gs-review/>]]
''Drowned God'' uses a [[point-and-click]] interface and [[first person perspective]] typical of games similar to ''[[Myst]]'' of the mid- to late-1990s.<ref name=gs-review/>  The player navigates and interacts with the game world by clicking the mouse on different parts of the screen.<!--quandary-->  The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an [[Eye of Providence]] for activating or interacting with objects in the environment.  Frequent [[cutscene]]s provide background information and advance the storyline.<ref name=quandary/>

The game is filled with a variety of puzzles that must be solved to advance the story.  These include memory games and mazes.<ref name=gs-review/>  Others involve competing against a computer-controlled opponent, completing a sequence in a limited number of moves, operating mechanisms, or using an inventory item.<ref name=just/>  Puzzles do not all have to be completed in a precise order; there is some flexibility in terms of being able to move through game areas and work on different challenges.<ref name=quandary/>

One of the best received puzzles in the game involves arranging the pieces of a dialogue between the sculpted heads of Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein.<ref name=just/><ref name=gs-review/><!-- manual -->  The player listens to the randomly ordered statements made by each head, then decides how to chronologically arrange the statements to form a coherent conversation based on context.<ref name=manual>{{cite book | title=Drowned God ''Manual'' | page=XXX | publisher=[[Inscape (publisher)|Inscape]] | year=1996}}</ref>

==Development==
[[Harry Horse]] conceived the game's ancient planetwide conspiracy. Horse had previously written several children's books and received the [[Scottish Arts Council]] Writer of the Year award for his 1983 book, ''[[The Ogopogo <U+2013> My Journey with the Loch Ness Monster]]''.<!-- gs-interview -->  He began forging documents that same year as a way to earn money.<ref name=gs-interview>{{cite interview | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/harryhorse/ | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000819070822/http://www.gamespot.com/features/harryhorse/ | last=Horse | first=Harry | subjectlink=Harry Horse | title=Alien Tongue: An Interview with Drowned God creator Harry Horse | interviewer=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CNET]] | archivedate=August 19, 2000 | accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>  The story which became the basis for ''Drowned God'' was originally a phony manuscript Horse wrote in 1983, ostensibly describing events after the destruction of the lost city of [[Atlantis]].<ref name=gs-preview>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/drowned-god/previews/drowned-god-preview-2558625/ | title=Drowned God Preview | publisher=[[GameSpot]]. [[CNET]] | date=May 1, 1996 | accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>  The manuscript, dated 1846, was said to have been written by the English poet [[Richard Henry Horne|Richard Horne]], who shares Horse's birth name.<!-- gs-interview -->  Horse's initiation into the concept of an alternate history came in the early 1980s, when he first encountered professor Ian Halpke, who explained to him that information from the Kabbalah and ancient Jewish texts "hide and [[cipher|encipher]] the secret", namely, that human evolution was aided by extraterrestrial intelligence.<!-- gs-interview -->  According to Horse, Halpke also believed that the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was a nuclear device, and that humans and pigs shared compatible [[gene]]s.<ref name=gs-interview/>

Initially, experts determined the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched the time period Horne had been alive and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests.<!-- gs-interview -->  Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of these details.<ref name=gs-interview/>  After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played ''[[Myst]]'' and ''[[7th Guest]]'' and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his [[conspiracy theory]]-inspired ideas.<ref name=gs-preview/>  He later said that while the story of ''Myst'' did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on ''Drowned God'' in 1994.<ref name=gs-interview/><ref name=herald/>

The game was originally commissioned by a division of [[Time Warner]] and was later taken over by Inscape when that division closed.<!-- gs-interview -->  Horse worked with Inigo Orduna and Anthony McGaw for six months designing the game, then cooperated with the game's artists and modelers until the project's completion.<ref name=gs-interview/> The game's producer, Algy Williams, hired puzzle expert [[Chris Maslanka]], whose output he called "fiendishly difficult", to design the game's puzzles together with John Morris.<!-- moby-credits --><ref name=gs-preview/> Williams also employed sculptor Greg Boulton, who had previously worked on the [[Peter Gabriel]] video "[[Sledgehammer (song)|Sledgehammer]]".<ref name=moby-credits>{{cite web | url= http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/drowned-god-conspiracy-of-the-ages/credits | title=Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages Credits | publisher=[[MobyGames]].

''Drowned God'' received mixed to positive reviews, with many critics complimenting the game's ideas and imagery while giving a less favorable response to its audio, puzzles, and execution.  [[GameSpot]] reviewer Vince Boardy wrote that the game sounded very promising, and might "also raise awareness of the thread of deception that runs throughout recorded history."<ref name=gs-review/> Steve Ramsey of ''Quandary'' said ''Drowned God'' presented its massive assortment of conspiracy theories in an entertaining way.<ref name=quandary>{{cite web | url=http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=335 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080622125027/http://www.quandaryland.com/jsp/dispArticle.jsp?index=335 | title=Drowned God Review | work=Quandary | author=Ramsey, Steve | date=December 2000 | archivedate=June 22, 2008 | accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>  Ray Ivey of [[Just Adventure]] called ''Drowned God'' "the strangest, creepiest, most psychedelic adventure game I've yet to come across."<!-- just --> Although Ivey did not understand much of the game, he still enjoyed it because "it made sense to the game's characters and creators."<ref name=just>{{cite web | url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Drowned_God/Drowned_God.shtm | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090101163757/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Drowned_God/Drowned_God.shtm | title=Review: Drowned God | author=Ivey, Ray | publisher=[[Just Adventure]] | archivedate=January 1, 2009 | accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>

T. Liam McDonald of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' wrote that he was "fascinated by the strong sense of style and the intellectual approach to terrific subject matter".<ref name=pc-gamer>{{cite journal | author=McDonald, T. Liam | work=[[PC Gamer]] | page=110 | publisher=[[Future Publishing]] | month=February | year=1997}}</ref>  Steven Levy and Patricia King of ''[[Newsweek]]'' found the game to be "richly detailed and original".<ref name=newsweek>{{cite journal | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1996/11/24/some-games-to-keep-you-mystified.html | title=Some Games to Keep You Mystified | last1=Levy | first1=Steven | last2=King | first2=Patricia | work=[[Newsweek]] | date=November 25, 1996<!--date is for original print--> | volume=128 | issue=22 | page=89 | accessdate=June 15, 2012}} ([http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/product-reviews/9611187981/some-games-keep-you-mystified article details])</ref>  In 2012, Andy Hughes of [[Topless Robot]] put the game at the top of his list of "9&nbsp;Surprising Literary References In Videogames".<!-- topless -->  Hughes wrote that the game was one that could be played from start to finish "without having any idea what the hell's going on", noting its references to a wide variety of subjects, including [[Egyptian mythology]], ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask]]'', and the [[Bermuda Triangle]].<ref name=topless>{{cite web | url=http://www.toplessrobot.com/2012/01/9_surprising_literary_references_in_videogames.php | author=Hughes, Andy | title=9 Surprising Literary References In Videogames | publisher=Topless Robot. [[Village Voice Media]] | date=January 23, 2012 | accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>

Boardy complimented the graphics, writing, "''Drowned God'' is loaded with freaky animations and unexpected visual twists".<ref name=gs-review>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/drowned-god/reviews/drowned-god-review-2540084/ | author= Broady, Vince | title=Drowned God Review | publisher=[[GameSpot]]. [[CNET]] | date=December 23, 1996 | accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>  Ramsey praised the visuals and the audio, considering both to contribute to the game's "shadowy and secretive feelings".<!-- quandary -->  His one significant criticism was that dialogue was difficult to hear, and that there was no option to display text for it.<ref name=quandary/>  Regarding the game's audio aspect, Boardy said, "The soundtrack is less impressive, primarily because of overuse: The background effects drone on mercilessly, and many of the game's narratives (which are universally well-written and finely acted) must be listened to over and over again."<ref name=gs-review/>

The puzzles, according to Boardy, were of uneven quality.  He called some "hopelessly difficult" and others extremely derivative.  By contrast he considered the [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Isaac Newton]] dialogue puzzle "brilliant", but also said, "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen far too many times already."<ref name=gs-review/> Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing "on almost every occasion I felt that I was making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost."<!-- quandary -->  He considered the puzzles to be mostly well-integrated, and found that those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment.<ref name=quandary/> Ivey remarked, "For puzzle lovers, ''Drowned God'' is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative."<ref name=just/>

Boardy panned the navigation for being confusing, counter-intuitive, and requiring the player to revisit locations multiple times.<!-- gs-review --> He concluded his review by saying, "The net effect is that the story<U+2014>which made this game so intriguing in the first place<U+2014>is almost totally lost, and that is a shame."<ref name=gs-review/>  GameSpot considered the game one of the most disappointing of 1996 in their annual recap, writing "the great premise is buried like the mysteries of the ages themselves under a mediocre ''Myst'' clone".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/bestworst96/disappointing.html | title=1996 Best & Worst Awards: Most Disappointing | publisher=[[GameSpot]].

Liam | work=[[PC Gamer]] | page=110 | publisher=[[Future Publishing]] | month=February | year=1997}}</ref>  Hughes called the pace of the game and its puzzles both "tedious" and "ponderous", but said it "had ambition out the genetically modified ears."<ref name=topless/>
