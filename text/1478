'''Chemical Bank''' was a bank with headquarters  in [[New York City]] from 1823 until 1996.  The bank operated as the primary subsidiary of the '''Chemical Banking Corporation''', a [[bank holding company]] established in 1988.  

Beginning in 1920 but accelerating in the 1980s and 1990s, Chemical was a leading consolidator of the banking industry in the United States, acquiring [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], [[Manufacturers Hanover]], [[Texas Commerce Bank]] and [[Corn Exchange Bank]] among others.  Following Chemical's acquisition of Chase, the bank adopted the venerable [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] brand.  What had been Chemical Bank, is at the core of what today is [[JPMorgan Chase]].

Chemical Bank was headquartered in [[New York City]].

==History==
===Founding and early history===
[[File:Certificate of Stock of Chemical Mfg Company 1824.png|thumb|200px|right|Certificate of Stock of the Chemical Manufacturing Company, ca. 1824]]
The company was founded in 1823 as the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company in [[Greenwich Village]].  It produced [[chemical]]s such as [[blue vitriol]], [[alum]], [[nitric acid]], [[camphor]] and [[saltpeter]], as well as medicines, paints, and [[dye]]s.<ref>[http://www.scripophily.net/chemnatbanof.html scripophily.net - Retrieved November 8, 2007]</ref>

[[File:Chemical bank Note 1835.png|thumb|200px|left|Chemical Bank $5 note, ca. 1835]]

Chemical's charter was amended in 1824 to allow banking practices and in 1844, when New York Chemical Manufacturing Company's original charter expired, the chemical company was liquidated and the company was reincorporated as a bank only, becoming the Chemical Bank of New York in 1844.  The company sold all remaining inventories from the chemical division as well as real estate holdings by 1851.

During the [[Panic of 1857]], Chemical Bank earned the nickname "Old Bullion" by redeeming bank notes in [[specie]] after most of the other banks, which had been hit hard, had turned to issuing paper promissory notes.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748374,00.html Business & Finance: Old Bullion's Team].  Time Magazine, Jan. 28, 1935</ref> While hundreds of banks closed, including 18 banks in New York in a single day, Chemical developed a reputation for stability.  This reputation proved extremely important in Chemical's growth during subsequent recessions during the 1860s.  Chemical received its [[national charter]] as the Chemical National Bank of New York in 1865 and, by the early 1870s, Chemical had deposits in excess of $6 million.

===1900-1958===
[[File:Chemical National Bank 270 Broadway.png|thumb|135px|right|Chemical National Bank offices at 270 Broadway, ca. 1913]]

By the first decade of the 20th century, Chemical was in decline, losing accounts each year.  Unlike many of its peers, Chemical had been reuluctant to expand into securities and other businesses and had not paid interest on bank accounts.  In 1917, Chemical named a new president of the bank, Herbert Twitchell,<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9503E5DA133AE433A25754C1A9619C946696D6CF TO HEAD CHEMICAL BANK.; Herbert K. Twitchell Elected Successor to Joseph B. Martindale]. New York Times, July 17, 1917</ref> who completed a major turnaround of Chemical, setting up a trust business.  Chemical's reversal of its interest bearing account policy, resulted in an increase in deposits from $35 million to $81 million by 1920.<ref name=chemcitizens /> 

[[File:Chemical National Bank Interior 270 Broadway.png|thumb|135px|left|Interior of Chemical National Bank offices at 270 Broadway, ca. 1913]]

In 1920, Chemical completed its first major acquisition, merging with Citizens National Bank.  The acqusition of Citizens National, a small New York commercial bank, increased Chemical's assets to more than $200 million with  more than $140 million of deposits.<ref name=chemcitizens>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950DE4DE173AEE32A2575AC1A9659C946195D6CF Chemical Bank to Absorb Citizens].  New York Times, March 19, 1920</ref>  In 1923 Chemical established its first branch and by the end of the 1920s had opened a dozen branches in Manhatttan and Brooklyn as well as a branch in London, its first international presence.

In 1929, Chemical reincorporated as a state bank in New York as Chemical Bank & Trust Company and merged with the United States Mortgage & Trust Company, headquartered on the [[Madison Avenue]] and [[74th Street (Manhattan)|74th Street]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/realestate/25scapes.html Depression-Era Alternatives to the Mattress Stash].

During this period, Chemical also established Chemical National Company a securities underwriting business. 

The bank began a series of mergers in the late 1940s and 1950s.  In 1947, Chemical merged with Continental Bank and Trust Company.  Chemical completed its largest acquisition to that point, merging with the [[Corn Exchange Bank]] to become the '''Chemical Corn Exchange Bank''' in 1954.  Founded in 1853, the Corn Exchange Bank was based in [[New York City]], but had built a network of branches in other states through the acquisition of community banks.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/realestate/streetscape-corn-exchange-bank-noble-monument-thrift-with-unusually-modern-air.html The Corn Exchange Bank; A 'Noble Monument to Thrift' With an Unusually Modern Air].  New York Times, November 1, 1987</ref>  The merger with the Corn Exchange Bank added 98 additional branches to Chemical's system largely in the New York City.

===1959 - 1979===
[[File:Chemical_New_York_1967_logo.png|thumb|right|210px|Chemical New York logo, ca. 1967, in use until the bank's reorganization as Chemical Banking Corporation in 1968]]
In 1959, the bank, now known as Chemical Corn Exchange Bank, merged with New York Trust Company, which had a large trust and wholesale-banking business.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892707,00.html Banking: Helm at the Helm].  Time Magazine, Jun. 15, 1959</ref>  At the time of the merger, Chemical Corn was the fourth largest bank in New York and New York Trust was the ninth largest bank and the merger created the third largest bank in New York, and the fourth largest in the U.S. with $3.8 billion of assets.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/09/nyregion/hulbert-aldrich-87-banking-executive-led-new-york-trust.html Hulbert Aldrich, 87; Banking Executive Led New York Trust].  New York Times, January 9, 1995</ref>  Following the merger, the bank dropped the usage of the "corn exchange" from the corporate name.  

In 1968, Chemical reorganized itself as a [[bank holding company]] which allowed for more rapid expansion.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A1EFD3C54157493C2AA178AD95F4C8685F9 New Status for Chemical Bank].  New York Times, November 30, 1968</ref>  Throughout the early 1960s Chemical had begun to expand into New York's suburbs, opening branches on [[Long Island]] and in [[Westchester County]].  However by the late 1960s and early 1970s, Chemical was focused on building its international business.  In these years, Chemical opened new offices in the [[Frankfurt, Germany]] (1969), [[Zurich, Switzerland]] (1971), [[Brussels, Belgium]] (1971), [[Paris, France]]  (1971) and [[Tokyo, Japan]] (1972).  

In 1975, Chemical acquired Security National Bank, which had a branch network on [[Long Island]].<ref name=chemicalking />

===1980s===
[[File:Chemical Bank 1971 logo.png|thumb|right|210px|Chemical Bank logo, ca. 1971, in use until the bank's merger with [[Manufacturers Hanover]]]]
Chemical continued pursuing acquisitions, throughout the 1980s notably its acquisitions of [[Texas Commerce Bank]] (1986) and [[Horizon Bancorp]] (1986) as well as its attempted takeover of [[Florida National Bank]] (1982).  

Chemical and [[Florida National Bank]] agreed, in 1982, to enter into a merger, after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted, giving Chemical an option to acquire the business.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E2D71238F933A15756C0A964948260 Florida Bank's Special Meeting].

[[Image:Texas Commerce Bancshares Logo.png|210px|thumb|right|[[Texas Commerce Bank]], acquired by Chemical in 1986 in the largest interstate banking merger at that time]]

Chemical completed its largest transaction of the 1980s in December 1986, when the bank agreed to acquire [[Texas Commerce Bank]].  The $1.1 billion transaction represented the largest interstate banking merger in U.S. history to that time.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/16/business/chemical-is-buying-a-big-texas-bank.html Chemical is Buying a Big Texas Bank].

New York Times, March 31, 1988</ref>  Texas Commerce, which was officially acquired in May 1987, was one of the largest bank holding companies in the Southwestern U.S., with a strong presence in corporate banking for small and medium sized businesses.  Chemical did not seek [[FDIC]] backing for its acquisition of Texas Commerce although other large Texas banks, [[First RepublicBank Corporation]] (Acquired by [[NationsBank]]) and [[MCorp Bank]] (acquired by [[Bank One]]), received over $5 billion of support.  Ultimately Chemical contributed $300 million to shore Texas Commerce as it continued to suffer losses.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/business/profile-marc-j-shapiro-this-banker-may-be-too-big-for-texas.html This Banker May Be Too Big for Texas].

Also in 1986, Chemical agreed to a merger with New Jersey-based [[Horizon Bancorp]], although the merger was not completed until 1989, due again to interstate banking rules.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/06/business/jersey-banks-await-mergers.html Jersey Banks Await Mergers].  New York Times, June 6, 1987</ref>  

The bank's holding company, which had been the Chemical New York Corporation was renamed the '''Chemical Banking Corporation''' in 1988 following its series of out of state mergers and acquisitions, including [[Texas Commerce Bank]] and [[Horizon Bancorp]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/17/business/company-news-chemical-s-name.html Chemical's Name].  Reuters, March 17, 1988</ref>  

It was during this period, in the 1980s and early 1990s, that Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of [[leveraged buyout]] transactions.  By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a [[leveraged finance|syndicated leveraged finance]] business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker, [[James B. Lee, Jr.|Jimmy Lee]].<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3522103.arc.htm JIMMY LEE'S GLOBAL CHASE].

New York Times, August 11, 1995</ref>  It was not until 1993 that Chemical would permission to underwrite corporate bonds, however within a few years, Chemical (and later Chase) became a major underwriter of below-investment-grade debt under Lee.  Additionally, in 1984, Chemical launched [[Chemical Venture Partners]] to invest in [[private equity]] transactions alongside various [[financial sponsor]]s.<ref>[http://media.www.harbus.org/media/storage/paper343/news/2003/02/10/News/Interview.With.Jeff.Walker.Managing.Partner.Of.Jp.Morgan.Partners-365198.shtml Interview with Jeff Walker, Managing Partner of JP Morgan Partners].

===1990s===
[[File:Manufacturers Hanover logo.png|210px|thumb|right|[[Manufacturers Hanover]], acquired by Chemical in 1991 in the largest banking merger at that time]]

In July 1991, Chemical announced that it would acquire [[Manufacturers Hanover Corporation]] in a $135 billion merger transaction.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/16/business/the-bank-merger-manny-hanny-a-name-for-history-books.html  'Manny Hanny': A Name for History Books].  New York Times, July 16, 1991</ref>  At the time of the merger, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover were the sixth and ninth largest banks, respectively, by assets.  The transaction, when it closed at the end of 1991, made the combined bank, which retained the Chemical name, the second largest bank in the U.S., behind [[Citicorp]] both in terms of assets and customers (approximately 1.2 million household accounts in 1991).<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/16/business/the-bank-merger-big-bank-merger-to-join-chemical-manufacturers.html The Bank Merger; Big Bank Merger To Join Chemical, Manufacturers].  New York Times, July 16, 1991</ref>  Chemical adopted Manufacturers Hanover's logo design and moved into its headquarters at [[270 Park Avenue]] in New York.  In corporate banking, Manufacturers Hanover was better established with larger, blue-chip companies, whereas Chemical had been stronger with small- and medium-sized businesses.<ref name=chemicalking>[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/11/business/a-market-where-chemical-is-king.html A Market Where Chemical is King].  New York Times, January 11, 1987</ref>  

Nationally, the combined Chemical bank became one of the largest lenders to U.S. companies and was the arguably the leader in loan syndications globally.  Additionally, Chemical took a leading role providing foreign exchange, interest rate and currency swaps, corporate finance services, cash management, corporate and institutional trust, trade services and funds transfer. Chemical operated one of the nation's largest bank credit card franchises and was a major originator and servicer of home mortgages.<ref>[http://www.chasealum.org/article.html?aid=197 The History of Chemical Bank].  JPMorgan Chase Archives</ref>

In 1996, Chemical acquired [[The Chase Manhattan Corporation]] in a merger valued at $10 billion to create the largest financial institution in the United States.  Although Chemical was the acquirer, the bank adopted the [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] brand, which was considered to be better known, particularly internationally.  Chase, which had been the largest bank in the U.S. had fallen to sixth, while Chemical was the third largest bank at the time of the merger.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/29/us/banking-s-new-giant-deal-chase-chemical-agree-merge-10-billion-deal-creating.html Banking's New Giant: The Deal; Chase and Chemical Agree to Merge in $10 Billion Deal Creating Largest U.S. Bank].

New York Times, March 29, 1996</ref>

The bank continued to operate under the Chase brand until the bank acquired [[J.P. Morgan & Co.]] in December 2000 to form [[JPMorgan Chase & Co.]]  Throughout all of these acquisitions, Chemical's original management team remained in charge of both the bank and its private equity investment group, JP Morgan Partners, until acquiring [[Bank One]] in 2004.
