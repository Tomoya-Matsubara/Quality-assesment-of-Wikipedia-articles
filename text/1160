ELF waves have been used in very few manmade communications systems because of the difficulty of building efficient antennas for such long waves.  Ordinary types of antenna ([[half-wave antenna|half-wave dipoles]] and [[monopole antenna|quarter-wave monopoles]]) cannot be built for such extremely long waves because of their size.  A [[half wave dipole]] for 80&nbsp;Hz would be 1162 miles long.  So even the largest practical antennas for ELF frequencies are very [[Electrical length|electrically short]], very much smaller than the wavelength of the waves they radiate.<ref name="Barr" />  The disadvantage of this is that the efficiency of an antenna drops as its size is reduced below a wavelength.<ref name="Barr" />  An antenna's  [[radiation resistance]], and the amount of power it radiates, is proportional to ('''''L'''''/'''''<U+03BB>''''')<sup>2</sup> where '''''L''''' is its length and '''''<U+03BB>''''' is the wavelength.  So even physically large ELF antennas have very small radiation resistance, and so radiate only a tiny fraction of the input power as ELF waves; most of the power applied to them is dissipated as heat in various ohmic [[Electrical resistance|resistances]] in the antenna.<ref name="Jones" />  ELF antennas must be tens to hundreds of kilometers long, and must be driven by powerful [[transmitter]]s in the [[megawatt]] range, to produce even a few watts of ELF radiation.  Fortunately, the attenuation of ELF waves with distance is so low (1 - 2 [[Decibel|dB]] per 1000&nbsp;km)<ref name="Jones" /> that a few watts of radiated power is enough to communicate worldwide.<ref name="NavyFactSheet" />

A second problem stems from the required [[polarization]] of the waves.  ELF waves only propagate long distances in [[vertical polarization]], with the direction of the [[magnetic field]] lines horizontal and the [[electric field]] lines vertical.<ref name="Barr" />  Vertically oriented antennas are required to generate vertically polarized waves.  Even if sufficiently large conventional antennas could be built on the surface of the Earth, these would generate horizontally polarized, not vertically polarized waves.

It consists of two widely separated electrodes ''(G)'' buried in the ground, connected by overhead transmission cables to a transmitter ''(P)'' located between them.    The [[alternating current]] from the transmitter ''(I)'' travels in a loop through one transmission line, kilometers deep into bedrock from one ground electrode to the other, and back through the other transmission line.  This creates an alternating magnetic field ''(H)'' through the loop, which radiates ELF waves.  The axis of the magnetic field produced is horizontal, so it generates vertically polarized waves.  The [[radiation pattern]] of the antenna is directional, with two lobes (maxima) in the plane of the loop, off the ends of the transmission lines.<ref name="Wolkoff" /><ref name="Jones" />  In the U.S. installations two ground dipoles are used, oriented perpendicular to each other, to allow transmission in all directions. 

The amount of power radiated by a loop antenna is proportional to ('''''IA''''')<sup>2</sup>, where '''''I''''' is the AC current in the loop and '''''A''''' is the area enclosed,<ref name="Jones" />  To radiate practical power at ELF frequencies, the loop has to carry a current of hundreds of amperes and enclose an area of at least several square miles.<ref name="Jones" />   Christofilos found that the lower the [[electrical conductivity]] of the underlying rock, the deeper the current will go, and the larger the effective loop area.<ref name="NavyFactSheet" /><ref name="Jones" />  Radio frequency current will penetrate into the ground to a depth equal to the ''[[skin depth]]'' of the ground at that frequency, which is inversely proportional to the square root of ground conductivity '''''<U+03C3>'''''.  The ground dipole forms a loop with effective area of '''''A''''' = '''''L<U+03B4>''''' / &radic;2, where '''''L''''' is the total length of the transmission lines and '''''<U+03B4>''''' is the [[skin depth]].<ref name="Jones" /><ref name="Fraser-Smith" />    So ground dipoles are sited over low conductivity underground rock formations (this contrasts with ordinary radio antennas, which require ''good'' earth conductivity for a low resistance [[ground (electricity)|ground]] connection for their transmitters).

The Republic facility had two 14 mi. dipoles oriented east-west, and one 28 mi. dipole oriented north-south.]]   

After initially considering several larger systems ([[Project Sanguine]]), the U.S. Navy constructed two ELF transmitter facilities, one at [[Clam Lake, Wisconsin]] and the other at [[Republic, Michigan]], 145 miles apart.<ref name="NavyFactSheet" /><ref name="Altgelt" /> They could operate independently, or phase synchronized as one antenna for greater output power.<ref name="Altgelt" />   The Clam Lake site, the initial test facility,  transmitted its first signal in 1982<ref name="Altgelt" /> and began operation in 1985, while the Republic site became operational in 1989.  

The Clam Lake antenna consisted of two perpendicular 14 mile (24&nbsp;km) ground dipole transmission lines in the shape of a cross, with the transmitter station at their intersection.<ref name="Altgelt" /><ref name="Heppenheimer" />  The Republic antenna consisted of three ground dipoles, two 14 mile and one 28 mile transmission line,<ref name="Altgelt" /> in the shape of the letter "F" (the shape is not significant and was dictated by land availability).<ref name="Heppenheimer" />  The lines, made of 1.5&nbsp;cm aluminum cable supported on insulators on 40&nbsp;ft. wooden poles, resembled ordinary power transmission lines.<ref name="Jones" />  The ends of the transmission lines were grounded by 1 to 3 miles of buried copper cable and ground rods,<ref name="Jones" />  later replaced by arrays of electrodes in deep 300&nbsp;ft. boreholes,<ref name="Altgelt" /> to reduce surface ground currents to address environmental concerns.

The transmitters operated at a frequency of 76&nbsp;Hz, with an alternate frequency capability of 45&nbsp;Hz.<ref name="Jones" />  Each Clam Lake ground dipole was normally driven with a current of 300 amperes, from a 1.2 MW peak power transmitter powered from a 4160 V utility line with diesel backup.<ref name="Jones" />    Each loop had a resistance of 5 ohms and an inductance of 50 millihenries, which could be tuned out by capacitor banks.<ref name="Jones" />    The transmitter synthesized the sinusoidal output waveform with banks of high power [[silicon controlled rectifier|SCR]]s.<ref name="Sueker" />   The relative amplitude and [[phase]] of the drive current in each of the perpendicular loops could be controlled to radiate in a specific direction, or equally in all directions.<ref name="Jones" />     

As with all ELF radiators, the antennas were extremely inefficient, with almost all of the input power dissipated as heat in ground resistance.   At an input power of 450&nbsp;kW, each of the Clam Lake dipoles radiated less than 1 watt of ELF waves, giving an efficiency of 2<U+00D7>10<sup><U+2212>6</sup>.<ref name="Jones" />  The total output power of both sites working together was 8 watts.<ref name="NavyFactSheet" />  However due of the low attenuation of ELF waves this tiny radiated power was able to communicate with submarines over about half the Earth's surface.<ref name="Blair" >{{cite book

==Russian Navy ZEVS antennas==
The Russian Navy operates an ELF transmitter facility, named ZEVS ("Zeus"), to communicate with its submarines, located northwest of [[Murmansk]] on the [[Kola peninsula]] in northern Russia.<ref name="Bashkuev" /><ref name="Trond" />  Signals from it were detected in the 1990s at Stanford University and elsewhere.<ref name="Trond" /><ref name="Fraser-Smith" />  It normally operates at 82&nbsp;Hz, using MSK (minimum shift keying) modulation.<ref name="Trond" /> although it reportedly can cover the frequency range from 20 to 250&nbsp;Hz.<ref name="Bashkuev" /><ref name="Fraser-Smith" />   It reportedly consists of two parallel ground dipole antennas 60&nbsp;km long, driven at currents of 200 to 300 amperes.<ref name="Trond" /><ref name="Fraser-Smith" />  Calculations from intercepted signals indicate it is 10 dB more powerful than the U.S. transmitters.<ref name="Fraser-Smith" />  Unlike them it is used for geophysical research in addition to military communications.<ref name="Bashkuev" /><ref name="Trond" />

==Radiated power==
The total power radiated by a ground dipole is<ref name="Jones" />
:<math>P = \frac {\pi^2 f^2 I^2 L^2}{2 c^2 h \sigma} \,</math>
where
:'''''f''''' is the frequency
:'''''I''''' is the RMS current in the loop
:'''''L''''' is the length of the transmission line
:'''''c''''' is the [[speed of light]]
:'''''h''''' is the height above ground of the [[ionosphere]] D layer
:'''''<U+03C3>''''' is the ground [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]]

The radiated power of an electrically small loop antenna normally scales with the fourth power of the frequency, but at ELF frequencies the effects of the ionosphere result in a less severe reduction in power proportional to the square of frequency.

==Receiving antennas==
Ground dipoles are not needed for reception of ELF signals.   The requirements for receiving antennas at ELF frequencies are less stringent than transmitting antennas, because the [[signal to noise ratio]] in ELF [[Radio receiver|receivers]] is dominated by the large atmospheric noise in the band.  The level of signal strength at the antenna is far above the noise in the receiver circuit, so small inefficient receiving antennas can be used.  Various types of coil and ferrite loop antennas have been used for reception.
