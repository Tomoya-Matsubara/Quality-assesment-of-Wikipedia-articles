'''St. Paul's Episcopal Church''' in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York, United States, is located at Third (northbound [[U.S. Route 4 in New York|US 4]]) and State streets. It is home to one of the oldest congregations in the city. In 1979, the church and two outbuildings were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Seven years later, when the [[Central Troy Historic District]] was created and added to the Register, it was listed as a [[contributing property]].

It was built in the mid-1820s as a direct copy of [[Ithiel Town]]'s Trinity Church in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], making it one of the earliest churches in America to embrace [[Gothic Revival]] elements. Today, due to changes in the original, St. Paul's is closer to Trinity's original appearance than Trinity itself. During renovations in the late 1890s, [[stained glass]] and other interior work by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] was added.

==Church complex==

There are three buildings on the church's [[lot (real estate)|lot]]. The church is supplemented by the Guild House to the east, and  the Martha Memorial House attached to the northeast corner serves as the [[parish]] offices.

The church itself is rectangular in shape, five [[bay (architecture)|bays]] long by three wide. It is faced in [[limestone]] blocks laid in a random [[ashlar]] pattern with dressed [[pilaster]]s at the corners. There are five [[lancet window]]s along the south profile and four along the north. Both the west and east [[facade]]s have three similar windows apiece. A horizontal [[course (architecture)|course]] connects all the north and south windows at the lancet's spring. The roofline is marked by a [[ornament (architecture)|decorated]] wooden [[cornice]]. A hundred-foot-high (30 m) [[tower]] rises from 12 feet (4 m) above the main entrance on the western facade. Inside its [[crenellation|crenellated]] top is a {{convert|2200|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Bell (instrument)|bell]].<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The front entrance doubles as the Wayside Chapel. Inside the [[plate glass]] doors, the church's [[sanctuary]] divides its [[pew]]s with three [[aisle]]s. [[Chandelier]]s illuminate each section, and a colored -glass lamp hangs over the [[altar]]. The high ceiling is supported with wooden [[truss]]es; they and the [[clerestory]] screens are carved and decorated with gold-tone [[aluminum]] leaf.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The Guild House, originally the Parish House, is a three-story three-bay limestone building meant to be sympathetic to the church to its west. Its interior woodwork and windows are original, although other renovations have taken place. The Martha Memorial House is similar in size and shape but faced in [[brick]]. It has been more extensively modernized, but a second-floor chapel is intact as are its windows, woodwork and a staircase.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

===Aesthetics===
The building's original decoration was believed at the time to be consistent with a house of worship. It also shows the influence of 16th-century English churches and, in its rough surfacing and irregular [[masonry]], a touch of the contemporary [[Picturesque]] styling.<ref name="Church history" />

It resembles Town's Trinity Church in every way save the use of a different stone in a different color. Since Trinity's tower has been replaced since it was built, it now reflects the original appearance of Trinity more than Trinity itself does.<ref name="NRHP nom" /><ref name="Church history" />

==History==
[[File:St Pauls Old Downsampled.png|thumb|left|The original church at Third and Congress Streets]]
[[File:St Pauls New Downsampled.png|thumb|left|Engraving of the current church in 1876]]
The congregation was organized in 1795, not long after the city itself was first [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]]. With financial support from [[New York City]]'s [[Trinity Church, New York|Trinity Church]], and the leadership of its first rector, the Rev. David Butler, it built its first church in 1804 at what is now the intersection of Third and Congress streets. That building was noted in 1818 as having the city's only [[pipe organ|organ]].<ref name="Church history">{{cite web|title=St. Paul's Church in Troy, NY - History|url=http://www.stpaulstroy.org/history.html|publisher=St. Paul's Episcopal Church|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref>  In 1826, its membership swelling due to the rapid growth of what was now a [[Administrative divisions of New York#City|city]], the congregation commissioned the new building.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The [[contract]] specified that the new church was to be a copy of [[Ithiel Town]]'s Trinity Church in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], finished in 1817, except where otherwise noted. The only significant difference between the two was their facing: Trinity used brown [[granite]] whereas St. Paul's used blue-gray limestone [[quarry|quarried]] in nearby [[Amsterdam (town), New York|Amsterdam]]. Ground was broken in 1826; the church was in use two years later.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

In the years after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the church began renovations, starting with the Parish House, now the Guild House, in 1869. The [[battlement]]s and [[pinnacle]]s on the cornices were removed, and the bell tower modified, when a new bell was installed in the 1870s. In 1881, the construction of Martha House (to which a second story was added six years later), originally a residence for the [[nun]]s associated with the church, cost it the easternmost window on the northern profile. Otherwise, the exterior is as it originally was.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

On the inside, a [[brass]] [[pulpit]] and new [[marble]] were added later in the 1880s. These led to the major renovations to the interior early in the 1890s, after money was raised to fix structural problems from the original construction.<ref name="Church history" /> Hidden [[steel]] pillars shored up the church, and the ceiling was opened up, its trusses now visible. The rector at the time had recently returned from a tour of Europe's great Gothic churches, and so [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]]'s company was hired to redecorate the interior afterwards, adding much of the glass and woodwork done by local craftsmen to Tiffany's designs. The stained glass windows were added shortly afterwards.<ref name="NRHP nom" />

The 20th century saw a few more changes. A third story was added to Guild House in 1914. The church itself got its current organ in 1921,<ref name="Church history" /> the Wayside Chapel in the 1940s, and the glass doors in the 1960s.<ref name="NRHP nom" />
