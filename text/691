'''Earl W. Hebner''' (born [[May 17]] [[1949]], in [[Richmond, Virginia]]) is a [[professional wrestling]] [[referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] currently working for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]. He is perhaps best known from his time as the senior referee for the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment and later on in the same role on their ''[[WWE Raw|RAW]]'' [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] from 2002-2005. As Senior Referee, Hebner officiated most main events, including the infamous "[[Montr<U+00E9>al Screwjob]]" during the main event of the [[Survivor Series (1997)|1997 ''Survivor Series]]''. In all, his WWF/E career lasted from 1988-2005

==Career==
===Early career===
Hebner officiated matches for Jim Crockett Promotions during much of the 1980s. He was the referee during the famous "I Quit" match at ''[[Starrcade#1985|StarrCade 1985]]'' between [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Magnum T.A.]] as well as the final match of the Bunkhouse Stampede tournament in January [[1988]]. Just days after that match, Hebner debuted in the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] as a referee during a [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] match pitting champion [[Hulk Hogan]] against challenger [[Andr<U+00E9> the Giant]], which aired live on [[February 5]], 1988, on [[NBC]]'s ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]''. In the storyline, Hebner's twin brother [[Dave Hebner]] was the assigned official, but unbeknownst to Hogan, Andr<U+00E9>'s [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[Ted DiBiase]] had bribed Earl to take his brother's place. Earl then counted Andr<U+00E9>'s [[Pinfall (professional wrestling)|pin]] against Hogan, even though Hogan's shoulders were clearly off the mat. As Andr<U+00E9> and DiBiase were celebrating (with Andr<U+00E9> quickly "selling" his title to an overjoyed DiBiase), Dave (whom DiBiase had locked in a closet prior to the match) ran to the ring and confronted Earl. The two brothers argued, and then they fought each other in the middle of the ring  then Earl knocked his brother down. Hulk Hogan, figuring out that Dave's "evil twin" had jobbed him out, picked Earl up and gorilla press slammed him over the ropes and onto the aisleway (missing DiBiase). This match helped set up a fourteen-man elimination tournament at ''[[WrestleMania IV]]'', since WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] declared the title "vacant" a week after ''The Main Event'' match as the WWF Championship "cannot be bought or sold," where the winner would win the WWF Championship. [[Vince McMahon]] paid both Hebners a bonus of $2,500 [[USD]] for participating in the angle and Earl quickly became a regular WWF referee, where he counted Randy Savage to victory and the Federation championship at ''WrestleMania IV.''

===The Montr<U+00E9>al Screwjob===
{{main|Montr<U+00E9>al Screwjob}}
Perhaps the most infamous event in Hebner's career&mdash;and possibly in the history of professional wrestling in North America&mdash;came during the main event of the [[Survivor Series (1997)|1997 ''Survivor Series'']] in what has since been dubbed the "Montr<U+00E9>al Screwjob." During a match for the WWF Championship between then-champion [[Bret Hart]] and challenger [[Shawn Michaels]], Hebner signaled for the timekeeper to ring the bell (signifying the end of the match) while Michaels had Hart in a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] hold&mdash;Hart's long-established signature move&mdash;even though Hart visibly had not submitted. Michaels had thus "won" the WWF Championship. This was not the match ending that Hart had asked for. Hebner had, at the behest of [[Vince McMahon]], "screwed" Hart out of the title. The reason for the "screwjob" was that Hart, who would be leaving the company a day later to join rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]], was unwilling to lose the title to Michaels in [[Montr<U+00E9>al]]&mdash;Montr<U+00E9>al is, in many estimations, one of the richest venues in Canadian wrestling history, aside from [[Calgary, Alberta|Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. Though Hart claimed that he was willing to lose to anyone but Michaels the next night on ''RAW'', McMahon feared that Hart would leave the company with the title, take the belt to WCW, and disrespect it as [[Debra Miceli|Madusa]] had done in [[1995]] with the [[WWE Women's Championship|WWF Women's Championship]], throwing the belt into a garbage can during a live [[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]] show. He therefore decided to forcibly remove the title from Hart by instructing Hebner (who had previously promised Hart "on his children's lives" that he would not betray him) to signal an end to the bout when Michaels had Hart in a submission hold. The fallout of the [[screwjob (professional wrestling)|screwjob]] led to a large degree of antagonism towards Hebner, McMahon, and Michaels, especially in [[Canada]], where fans often chant "You screwed Bret!" at the offending parties. In the same vein, Earl's son [[Brian Hebner|Brian]], a former WWE referee on the ''[[WWE Friday Night SmackDown!|SmackDown!]]'' brand, received chants of "Your dad screwed Bret!" at shows in Canada.

===Later WWE Career===
Hebner had several health episodes during his WWE career. Hebner was hospitalized with a heart problem shortly before ''[[WrestleMania XII]]''. Then, prior to the ''[[WrestleMania XIV]]'' [[pay-per-view]], Hebner was in a [[hotel]] lobby in [[British Columbia]] when he felt sharp pains in his neck. Once he returned to his room, he looked in the mirror and found his eyes bloodshot. He hurriedly called his brother Dave, who came up to help him. He was then taken to a British Columbia hospital where he remained until after the event. 

Hebner was involved in several [[angle (professional wrestling)|storylines]]. He spearheaded the ([[kayfabe]]) referee's [[Strike action|strike]] in [[1999]], resulting in referees being given the authority to defend themselves if physically provoked by wrestlers. In early [[2000]], he cost [[Triple H]] his WWF Championship by quick-counting during a match between Triple H and [[Chris Jericho]] following weeks of abuse by Triple H. Triple H eventually forced Hebner to reverse the decision, promising never to lay his hands on Hebner as long as Hebner was a WWF employee. After Hebner took the title from Jericho and gave it back to Triple H, Triple H "fired" Hebner and promptly [[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Pedigreed]] him and beat him unconscious. Hebner was reinstated by [[Linda McMahon]] thirteen days later, replacing corrupt guest referee [[Shane McMahon]] during a title match between Triple H and [[The Rock (entertainer)|The Rock]] at ''[[WWE Backlash#2000|Backlash 2000]]'' and counting the fall when the Rock covered Triple H for the pin. In late [[2001]], during [[The Invasion (pro wrestling)|the Invasion]], Hebner [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuded]] with WCW Head Referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]].

Hebner was released from WWE on [[July 18]], [[2005]], allegedly for selling WWE merchandise without permission. Hebner's brother Dave was also released on [[July 19]] in connection with these events. These activities would have been conducted from a store that Earl Hebner had partial ownership in the [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] based Pro Shirt Shop. To avoid negative publicity, the controlling owner of the Pro Shirt Shop Nick Ridenour bought out Hebner's share in the company and released a press statement which claimed that the company only received merchandise from "licensed distributors."

Since his release, he and his brother Dave have been working on a tell all book about WWE and the McMahons.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===
On [[February 12]], [[2006]], Hebner debuted for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] at the ''[[TNA Against All Odds#2006|TNA Against All Odds 2006]]'' pay-per-view. He officiated the main event, which saw the Canadian [[Jason Reso|Christian Cage]] defeat [[Jeff Jarrett]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. During the match, commentators [[Mike Tenay]] and [[Don West (sportscaster)|Don West]] alluded to the Montr<U+00E9>al Screwjob on several occasions, urging Hebner not to call for the bell when Jarrett placed Cage in a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|sharpshooter]]. Despite the concerns of the commentators, Hebner was an impartial referee.  However, he once again caused controversy based on his actions at the ''[[TNA Slammiversary (2006)|TNA Slammiversary 2006]]'' pay-per-view.  During the King of the Mountain match, he assisted Jeff Jarrett in winning the match by pushing a ladder over with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and then-champion Christian Cage on it.  This led to the new head of management [[Jim Cornette]] taking the belt from Jarrett as the show ended, leaving the status of the belt in question as to who would be the champion. On the [[June 22]] episode of ''[[TNA Impact!|TNA iMPACT!]]'', Cornette vacated the title. On the [[June 30]] episode, he awarded the title to Jarrett, but fired ([[kayfabe]]) Hebner. Hebner was then reinstated by Cornette due to Jarrett's polygraph test saying that Hebner was not involved.  Earl recently competed in a Hair vs Hair match against his son [[Brian Hebner]].

==Outside of wrestling==
Hebner played himself in the episode "Sixteen Candles and Four-Hundred Pound Men" of ''[[Boy Meets World]].'' Stock footage of one of his WWF matches was also featured in the motion picture ''[[Encino Man]].''
