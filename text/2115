The live-band lineup has changed consistently throughout the band's history, with Reznor remaining the only constant on vocals and lead guitar.

Between major tours, live band members have on occasion contributed instrumental performances to official Nine Inch Nails releases, though creative control and direction has always been the responsibility of Reznor.  Nine Inch Nails has released one album and three videos featuring the live band: ''[[Closure (video)|Closure]]'' (1997), a double-[[VHS]] set featuring live performances from the Self-Destruct tour; ''[[And All That Could Have Been]]'' (2000), released in [[CD]] and [[DVD]] formats featuring performances from the Fragility tour; and ''[[Beside You in Time]]'' (2007), a DVD featuring performances from the Live: With Teeth tour.
