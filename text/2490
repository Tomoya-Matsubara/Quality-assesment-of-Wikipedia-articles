The '''1968 Illinois earthquake''' (or "'''New Madrid event'''"){{sfn|Hough|2002|p=209}} was the largest recorded earthquake in the U.S. [[Midwestern]] state of [[Illinois]]. Striking at 11:02&nbsp;a.m. on November&nbsp;9, it measured 5.4 on the [[Richter scale]].<ref name=IllinoisEarthquakeInfo>{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/index.php?regionID=13|title=Illinois Earthquake Information|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=July 16, 2008|accessdate=November 9, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081216063935/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/index.php?regionID=13| archivedate= 16 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Although there were no fatalities, the event caused considerable structural damage to buildings, including the toppling of chimneys, and shaking in the region's largest city [[Chicago]]. The earthquake was one of the most widely felt in U.S. history, affecting 23&nbsp;states over an area of {{convert|580000|sqmi|km2}}. In studying its cause, scientists discovered the [[Harrisburg, Illinois#Cottage Grove Fault System|Cottage Grove Fault]] in the [[Southern Illinois]] [[Geology of Illinois#Illinois Basin|Basin]].

Within the region, millions felt the rupture. Reactions to the earthquake varied: some people near the epicenter did not react to the shaking, while others panicked. A future earthquake in the region is extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6<U+2013>7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the [[Wabash Valley Seismic Zone|Wabash Valley seismic zone]] on the Illinois<U+2013>Indiana border, or the [[New Madrid fault zone]].

A [[focal mechanism|fault plane solution]] for the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes (one is always a [[fault plane]], the other an auxiliary plane) striking north<U+2013>south and dipping approximately 45 degrees to the east and to the west. This faulting suggests [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|dip slip reverse motion]] and a horizontal east<U+2013>west axis of confining stress.<ref name=BSSA/> At the time of the earthquake, no faults were known in the immediate epicentral region (see below), but the motion corresponded to movement along the [[Wabash Valley Fault System]] roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|...}} east of the region.<ref name=BSSA/> The rupture also partly occurred on the [[New Madrid Fault]], responsible for the great [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|New Madrid earthquakes]] in 1812.

Various theories were put forward for the cause of the rupture. Donald Roll, director of seismology at [[Loyola University Chicago]], proposed that the quake was caused by massive amounts of [[silt]] being deposited by rivers, generating a "seesaw" effect on the plates beneath. "The weight of the silt depressed one end of the block and tipped up the other," he said.<ref name=NYT2/> However, scientists eventually realized the cause was a then-unknown fault, the [[Cottage Grove Fault]], a small tear in the Earth's rock in the Southern Illinois Basin near the city of [[Harrisburg, Illinois]]. 

The fault, which is aligned east&ndash;west, is connected to the north&ndash;south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end.<ref name=Bristol1979>{{cite paper|last=Bristol|first=Hubert M.|coauthor=Treworgy, Janis D.|title=The Wabash Valley fault System in Southeastern Illinois|year=1979|publisher=Illinois Institute of Natural Resources|version=Circular 509|url=http://library.isgs.uiuc.edu/Pubs/pdfs/circulars/c509.pdf|format=PDF|location=Urbana, Illinois|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref> Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed [[monocline]]s, [[anticline]]s, and [[syncline]]s, all of which suggest deformation during the [[Paleozoic era]], when [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip faulting]] took place nearby.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002NC/finalprogram/abstract_31987.htm

Damage was confined to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa,<ref name=USGS1/> and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed [[parapet]]s, and overturned tombstones. In one home in [[Dale, Illinois]], near [[Tuckers Corners, Illinois|Tuckers Corners]] and southwest of [[McLeansboro, Illinois|McLeansboro]], the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys.<ref name="McLeansboro Times">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcleansboro.net/history/quake.php|title=It's Official-County was Center of Earthquake|publisher=''McLeansboro Times-Leader''|accessdate=February 13, 2009}}</ref> Using a type of [[victim study]], the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking ([[Mercalli intensity scale|MM VII]]) took place in the [[Wabash Valley]], [[Ohio Valley]], and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands.<ref name=BSSA2/> Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the [[Gateway Arch]] were reported to authorities.<ref name=BSSA2/><ref name=Dispatch/> 

McLeansboro in particular experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its local high school reported 19&nbsp;broken windows in the girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The [[facade]] of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. [[Hamilton County, Illinois|Hamilton County]] Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to further damage.<ref name=McLean/>

Most of the buildings that experienced chimney damage were 30 to 50&nbsp;years old. The City Building in [[Henderson, Kentucky]], {{convert|50|mi|km|...}} east-southeast of the epicenter, sustained considerable structural damage. Moderate damage<U+2014>including broken chimneys and fractured walls<U+2014>occurred in towns in south-central Illinois, southwest Indiana, and northwest Kentucky. For instance, a concrete-brick [[cistern]] caved in {{convert|6.2|mi|km|...}} west of Dale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1968_11_09.php|title=Historic Earthquakes:Southern Illinois|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=July 16, 2008|date=November 14, 1968}}</ref>

In Lineville, Iowa, about {{convert|80|mi|km|...}} south of Des Moines on the Missouri border, the quake was felt as a long shaking.  The quake damaged the town's water tower which began to leak {{convert|300|USgal|L}} of water an hour.<ref>Times-Republican Newspaper; Corydon, Iowa; November 14, 1968</ref> 

Donald Roll correctly predicted the earthquake would have no aftershocks. He later said, "That was kind of a safety valve. The pressure which has been built up has been released." He also described the earthquake as "a very rare occurrence".<ref name=NYT2>{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=3&res=F70B13F73E54157493C3A8178AD95F4C8685F9|title=No Further Tremors Foreseen Following Quakes in 22 States|publisher=New York Times|date=November 11, 1968|accessdate=November 25, 2008 | format=PDF}}</ref>

=== Response ===
Millions in the area experienced the earthquake, the first major seismic event in decades. Following the tremor, businesses in the area emptied. Many residents did not believe that the earthquake was over magnitude 5. Others did not realize an earthquake was taking place, for example, some residents thought their furnaces had exploded,<ref name=McLean>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcleansboro.net/history/damage.php|title=Earthquake Damage Probable at 90% of county Buildings|publisher=McLeansboro Times Leader|date=November 14, 1968|accessdate=February 13, 2009}}</ref> and one man thought that the shaking was caused by his son "jumping up and down".<ref name=Reaction>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcleansboro.net/history/reaction.php|title=Some Took Quake Calmly, Others Shook For Hours|publisher=''McLeansboro Times-Leader''|accessdate=April 17, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090503074209/http://www.mcleansboro.net/history/reaction.php| archivedate= 3 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> At the Suntone Factory in McLeansboro, {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} from the epicenter, workers rushed out of the building, thinking a {{convert|1100|USgal|l|-2|adj=on}} [[water tank]] inside had fallen.<ref name=Reaction/>

People's reactions varied: some described themselves as "shocked"; others admitted to being "shaky" or nervous for the rest of the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving."<ref name=Reaction/> One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a "bomb".<ref name=Reaction/> Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The [[Window blind#Venetian|Venetian shades]] began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared."<ref name=Reaction/> People in the community of [[Mount Vernon, Illinois|Mount Vernon]] were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was "in a car&nbsp;... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".<ref name=Reaction/>

Douglas Wiens, a professor of earth and planetary sciences, reported: "The strongest earthquakes in the last few years have come from the Wabash Valley Fault",<ref name=Wabash/> and said the fault needs more scientific observation. Steven Obermeir of the [[United States Geological Survey]] is one of several scientists who have found sediments suggesting Wabash Valley Fault earthquakes around magnitude 7 on the Richter scale.<ref name=Wabash/> Michael Wyssession, an associate professor of earth and planetary sciences, denigrated the Madrid fault zone and said, "in 20&nbsp;years there have been three magnitude&nbsp;5 or better earthquakes on the Wabash Valley Fault. There is evidence that sometime in the past the Wabash Valley Fault has produced as strong as magnitude&nbsp;7 earthquakes. On the other hand, the New Madrid Fault has been very quiet for a long time now. Clearly, the Wabash Valley Fault has gotten our deserved attention."<ref name=Wabash/>
