{{History of Portugal|

The '''Portuguese First Republic''' ({{lang-pt|Primeira Rep<U+00FA>blica}}) spans a complex 16 year period in the [[history of Portugal|history of]] [[Portugal]], between the end of the [[History of Portugal (1834-1910)|Constitutional Monarchy]] marked by the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] and the [[28 May coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] of 1926. The last movement instituted a [[military dictatorship]] known as ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) that would be followed by the [[Corporatism|corporatist]] ''[[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]'' (New State) regime of [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar]].

==The republic==
The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] First Republic has, over the course of the recent past, lost many [[historians]] to the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|New State]]. As a result, it is difficult to attempt a global synthesis of the republican period in view of the important gaps that still persist in our knowledge of its political history. As far as the October 1910 Revolution is concerned, a number of valuable studies have been made <ref>Wheeler, 1972</ref>, first among which ranks Vasco Pulido Valente<U+2019>s polemical thesis. This historian posited the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] and urban nature of the revolution carried out by the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] (PRP) and claimed that the PRP had turned the republican regime into a de facto dictatorship <ref>Pulido Valente, 1982</ref>. This vision clashes with an older interpretation of the First Republic as a progressive and increasingly democratic regime which presented a clear contrast to [[Ant<U+00F3>nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]<U+2019>s ensuing [[dictatorship]] <ref>Oliveira Marques, 1991</ref>.

A republican [[Constitution]] was approved in 1911, inaugurating a parliamentary regime with reduced presidential powers and two chambers of parliament <ref>Miranda, 2001</ref>. The Republic provoked important fractures within Portuguese society, notably among the essentially monarchist rural population, in the trade unions, and in the Church. Even the PRP had to endure the secession of its more moderate elements, who formed conservative republican parties like the [[Evolutionist Party]] and the [[Republican Union (Portugal)|Republican Union]]. In spite of these splits the PRP, led by [[Afonso Costa]], preserved its dominance, largely due to a brand of clientelist politics inherited from the monarchy <ref name="Lopes, 1994">Lopes, 1994</ref>. In view of these tactics, a number of opposition forces resorted to violence in order to enjoy the fruits of power. There are few recent studies of this period of the Republic<U+2019>s existence, known as the <U+2018>old<U+2019> Republic. Nevertheless, an essay by Vasco Pulido Valente should be consulted <ref>1997a</ref>, as should the attempt to establish the political, social, and economic context made by M. Villaverde Cabral (1988).  

The Republic repelled a [[royalist attack on Chaves]] in 1912.  

{{See also|Portugal in World War I}}

The PRP viewed the outbreak of the [[First World War]] as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime and even around the party <ref>Teixeira, 1996a</ref>. These domestic objectives were not met, since participation in the conflict was not the subject of a national consensus and since it did not therefore serve to mobilise the population. Quite the opposite occurred: existing lines of political and ideological fracture were deepened by Portugal's intervention in the First World War <ref>Ribeiro de Meneses, 2000</ref>. The lack of consensus around Portugal<U+2019>s intervention in turn made possible the appearance of two dictatorships, led by General [[Pimenta de Castro]] (January-May 1915) and [[Sid<U+00F3>nio Pais]] (December 1917-December 1918).

[[Sidonismo]], also known as ''Dezembrismo'' ([[English language|Eng.]] ''Decemberism''), aroused a strong interest among historians, largely as a result of the elements of modernity that it contained <ref>Jos<U+00E9> Brand<U+00E3>o, 1990</ref><ref>Ramalho, 1998</ref><ref>Ribeiro de Meneses, 1998</ref><ref>Armando Silva, 1999</ref><ref>Samara, 2003</ref><ref>Santos, 2003</ref>. Ant<U+00F3>nio Jos<U+00E9> Telo has made clear the way in which this regime predated some of the political solutions invented by the [[totalitarian]] and [[fascist]] [[dictatorships]] of the 1920s and 1930s <ref>Teixeira, 2000, pp. 11-24</ref>. Sid<U+00F3>nio Pais undertook the rescue of traditional values, notably the ''P<U+00E1>tria'' ([[English language|Eng.]] ''Homeland''), and attempted to rule in a charismatic fashion. A move was made to abolish traditional political parties and to alter the existing mode of national representation in parliament (which, it was claimed, exacerbated divisions within the ''P<U+00E1>tria'') through the creation of a [[corporativism|corporative]] [[Senate]], the founding of a [[single party]] (the [[Partido Nacional Republicano|National Republican Party]]), and the attribution of a mobilising function to the Leader. The State carved out an economically interventionist role for itself while, at the same time, repressing working-class movements and leftist republicans. Sid<U+00F3>nio Pais also attempted to restore public order and to overcome, finally, some of the rifts of the recent past, making the Republic more acceptable to [[monarchists]] and [[Catholics]].

The vacuum of power created by Sid<U+00F3>nio Pais' assassination <ref>Medina, 1994</ref> on 14 December 1918 led the country to a brief [[civil war]]. The monarchy<U+2019>s restoration was proclaimed in the north of Portugal on 19 January 1919 and, four days later, a monarchist insurrection broke out in [[Lisbon]]. A republican coalition government, led by [[Jos<U+00E9> Relvas]], coordinated the struggle against the monarchists by loyal army units and armed civilians. After a series of clashes the monarchists were definitively chased from [[Porto]] on 13 February 1919. This military victory allowed the PRP to return to government and to emerge triumphant from the elections held later that year, having won the usual absolute majority.

It was during this restoration of the "old" Republic that an attempted reform was carried out in order to provide the regime with greater stability. In August 1919 a conservative President was elected <U+2013> [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Jos<U+00E9> de Almeida]] (whose Evolutionist party had come together in wartime with the PRP to form a flawed, because incomplete, Sacred Union) <U+2013> and his office was given the power to dissolve Parliament. Relations with the [[Holy See]], restored by Sid<U+00F3>nio Pais, were preserved. The President used his new power to resolve a crisis of government in May 1921, naming a [[Partido Liberal|Liberal]] government (the Liberal party being the result of the postwar fusion of Evolutionists and Unionists) to prepare the forthcoming elections. These were held on 10 July 1921 with victory going, as was usually the case, to the party in power. However, Liberal government did not last long. On 19 October a military ''pronunciamento'' was carried out during which <U+2013> and apparently against the wishes of the coup's leaders <U+2013> a number of prominent conservative figures, including [[List of Prime Ministers of Portugal|Prime Minister]] [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Granjo]], were assassinated. This event, known as the "night of blood" <ref>Brand<U+00E3>o, 1991</ref> left a deep wound among political elites and public opinion. There could be no greater demonstration of the essential fragility of the Republic's institutions and proof that the regime was democratic in name only, since it did not even admit the possibility of the rotation in power characteristic of the elitist regimes of the nineteenth century.

A new round of elections on 29 January 1922 inaugurated a fresh period of stability, since the PRP once again emerged from the contest with an absolute majority. Discontent with this situation had not, however, disappeared. Numerous accusations of corruption, and the manifest failure to resolve pressing social concerns wore down the more visible PRP leaders while making the opposition<U+2019>s attacks more deadly. At the same time, moreover, all political parties suffered from growing internal faction-fighting, especially the PRP itself. The party system was fractured and discredited <ref name="Lopes, 1994"/><ref>Jo<U+00E3>o Silva, 1997</ref>. This is clearly shown by the fact that regular PRP victories at the ballot box did not lead to stable government. Between 1910 and 1926 there were forty-five governments. The opposition of [[List of Presidents of Portugal|presidents]] to single-party governments, internal dissent within the PRP, the party's almost non-existent internal discipline, and its constant and irrational desire to group together and lead all republican forces made any government's task practically impossible. Many different formulas were attempted, including single-party governments, coalitions, and presidential executives, but none succeeded. Force was clearly the sole means open to the opposition if it wanted to enjoy the fruits of power <ref>Schwartzman, 1989</ref><ref name="Pinto, 2000">Pinto, 2000</ref>.

By the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour another authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Since the opposition's constitutional route to power was blocked by the various means deployed by the PRP to protect itself, it turned to the army for support. The armed forces, whose political awareness had grown during the war, and whose leaders had not forgiven the PRP for sending them to a war they did not want to fight, seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of "order" against the "chaos" that was taking over the country. Links were established between conservative figures and military officers, who added their own political and corporative demands to the already complex equation. The [[28th May 1926 coup d'<U+00E9>tat|Revolution of 28 May 1926]] enjoyed the support of most army units and even of most political parties. As had been the case in December 1917, the population of Lisbon did not rise to defend the Republic, leaving it at the mercy of the army <ref>Ferreira, 1992a</ref>. There are few global and up-to-date studies of this turbulent third phase of the Republic<U+2019>s existence <ref>Marques, 1973</ref><ref>Telo, 1980 & 1984</ref>. Nevertheless, much has been written about the crisis and fall of the regime and the 28 May movement <ref>Cruz, 1986</ref><ref>Cabral, 1993</ref><ref>Rosas, 1997</ref><ref>Martins, 1998</ref>;<ref name="Pinto, 2000"/><ref>Afonso, 2001</ref>. The First Republic continues to be the subject of an intense debate which is impossible to summarise in these paragraphs <ref>Armando Malheiro da Silva, 2000</ref>. Nevertheless, one can distinguish three main interpretations. For some historians, the First Republic was a progressive and increasingly democratic regime. For others, it was essentially a prolongation of the liberal and elitist regimes of the nineteenth century. A third group, finally, chooses to highlight the regime's revolutionary, Jacobin, and dictatorial nature.
