The story describes the young [[widow]] Dou E from Chouzhou (<U+695A><U+5DDE>) whose husband Cai (<U+8521>) died two years after marrying. Dou was wrongfully accused by Zhang L<U+00FC>r (<U+5F35><U+9A62><U+5152>, literally "The Mule Zhang") of the murder of his father, when Dou E refused to marry Zhang L<U+00FC>r. Before her [[execution (legal)|execution]] (scene: <U+65AC><U+7AC7><U+5A25> "Zhai Dou E"), Dou E swore that her innocence would be proven when :
# dripping [[blood]] did not land on the ground;
# [[snow]] fell in the midst of summer and
# a three-year [[drought]] befell Chouzhou

All three, including the eerie "Snow in June" (scene: <U+516D><U+6708><U+96EA> "Liu Yue Xue") did occur. After the [[ghost]] of Dou E revealed the injustice to her father - Dou Tianzhang (<U+7AC7><U+5929><U+7AE0>), who eventually became a ''liangjunliefangshi'' inspector (<U+5169><U+6DEE><U+5EC9><U+8A2A><U+4F7F>) - Inspector Dou killed the corrupt officials and Zhang L<U+00FC>r.

The story was repeatedly used and modified by later [[dramatist]]s.
