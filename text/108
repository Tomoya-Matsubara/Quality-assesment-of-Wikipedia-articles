A '''mail transfer agent''' (MTA) (also called a ''mail transport agent'', ''message transfer agent'', or ''smtpd'' (short for [[SMTP]] [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]])), is a [[computer program]] or [[software agent]] that transfers [[electronic mail]] messages from one computer to another.

The term '''mail server''' is also used to mean a [[computer]] acting as an MTA that is running the appropriate software. The term '''mail exchanger''' (MX), in the context of the [[Domain Name System]] formally refers to an [[IP address]] assigned to a device hosting a ''mail server'', and by extension also indicates the server itself.

== Overview ==
An MTA receives mail from another MTA (relaying) or from a [[mail user agent]] (MUA). The MTA works behind the scenes, while the user usually interacts with the MUA. Every time an MTA receives an e-mail, it will add a "Received:" trace header field to the top of the message.  In this way, there is a record of which MTAs handled the e-mail and in which order.  Upon final delivery, the "Return-Path:" header will also be added to record the [[return path]].

The delivery of e-mail to a user's mailbox typically takes place via a [[mail delivery agent]] (MDA); many MTAs have basic MDA functionality built in, but a dedicated MDA like [[procmail]] can provide more sophisticated functionality.

According to one survey, [[sendmail]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]], and [[Exim]] together control over 85% of market share for SMTP service.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}<!-- This site wants 500 USD for this information <ref>Security Space [http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.200707/mxsurvey.html Mail (MX) Server Survey], 1st Aug 2007.</ref> -->

Another survey suggests a more balanced playing field, though it included hosted e-mail services such as [[Postini]].<ref name="oreilly">MailChannels [http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/sysadmin/2007/01/05/fingerprinting-mail-servers.html Mail Server Survey], 2006</ref>
