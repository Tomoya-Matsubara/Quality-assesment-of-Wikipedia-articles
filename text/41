==History==
In 1960, Brian Lloyd and Alastair Macleod, two experienced shipping managers and [[shipbroking]] partners, began formulating plans to take over an existing airline as part of a [[diversification]] [[strategic management|strategy]] into the airline business. After months of unsuccessfully trying to raise capital for their planned acquisition, financial backing was finally obtained the following year from [[Bolivia]]n tin magnate J. Ortiz-Pati<U+00F1>o<ref name="Lloyd_grounding"/> and [[Greece|Greek]] shipping magnate Nicholas Mavroleon to set up a new airline from scratch. This airline was to specialise in Far East "tramping", concentrating on ships' crews and freight. The founders chose the name ''Lloyd'' for their new venture. J. Ortiz-Pati<U+00F1>o and Nicholas Mavroleon became the respective [[chairman|chairmen]] of the airline and of [[Hong Kong]]-[[incorporation (business)|incorporate]]d Far East Aviation Company Ltd, a group [[holding company]].<ref name="Lloyd_61"/><ref>''Aeroplane <U+2014> Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, pp. 20, 23, Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref><ref name="ownership1">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200262.html ''Flight International'', 22 February 1968, ''Air Transport ...'', ''Looking into Lloyd'', p. 256]</ref><ref name="ownership2">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200302.html ''Flight International'', 29 February 1968, ''Air Transport ...'', ''Lloyd reorganisation'', p. 296]</ref>

Lloyd International Airways commenced operations in 1961 with a Douglas DC-4 acquired from [[Iceland]]ic airline [[Loftlei<U+00F0>ir]].<ref name="Lloyd_start"/> Its first engagement was a series of charter flights carrying ship crews between the [[United Kingdom]] and several destinations in the Far East.<ref name="Lloyd_69"/><ref name="BUA_Britannias">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%200101.html ''Flight International'', 16 January 1969, ''Lloyd increases Britannia fleet'', p. 83]</ref> It soon found other charter work for the aircraft, which led to the acquisition of two more DC-4s in 1962.

Lloyd International's first two years of operations were unprofitable, mainly as a result of uneconomic charter rates caused by excess capacity. Other contributing factors included an expensive emergency [[aircraft lease|lease]] of a replacement aircraft for a [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4]] destroyed in a refuelling fire and high [[full cost accounting#Overhead and indirect costs|overhead]]s due to a top-heavy administrative structure.<ref name="Supertramp_20">''Aeroplane <U+2014> Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, p. 20 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref>

[[Budget]]ing and [[management accounting|cost control]], introduced in 1963, ensured that charterers were only quoted profitable rates. This resulted in a partial withdrawal from the cut-throat British [[inclusive tour]] (IT) market and the opening of an office in Hong Kong to capture a greater share of lucrative Far East cargo traffic.<ref name="Supertramp_20"/>

To ensure every single operation showed a clear profit on a [[full cost accounting|full costing]] basis, ie inclusive of all [[operating cost#overhead (business)|overhead cost]]s, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The [[managing director]]'s authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, ie excluding overheads, was outweighed by the risk of having an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared [[cost accounting|actual cost]]s and [[cost accounting#revenue|revenue]]s with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring [[pilot in command|aircraft commander]]s to pay for all [[operating expense]]s other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as [[aircraft ground handling|ground handling]] fees, technical support services and catering supplies.<ref>''Aeroplane <U+2014> Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, pp. 20, 22 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref>

In addition, the principle of strict cost control was also applied to [[aircraft maintenance]] and flight operations. This entailed [[outsourcing]] all engineering work as the fleet was too small to warrant Lloyd International setting up its own maintenance department. It furthermore involved "buying" flying hours at a fixed rate.<ref name="Supertramp_22">''Aeroplane <U+2014> Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, p. 22 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref> Moreover, through [[Wheelock|Wheelock Marden]], Lloyd International was indirectly associated with the [[HAECO|Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company]]. This enabled it to draw on that company's extensive spares pool in Hong Kong.<ref name="Supertramp_23">''Aeroplane <U+2014> Biography of a Supertramp'', Vol. 112, No. 2863, p. 23 Temple Press, London, 1 September 1966</ref> (Other than Hong Kong, Lloyd International pursued a policy of not stationing any spares along regular routes flown by its aircraft. Instead each aircraft carried its own spares kit <U+2014> usually consisting of a spare wheel and brake <U+2014> and a ground engineer.<ref name="Supertramp_23"/>)

In the context of Lloyd International's management's firm belief in exercising tight control over ist costs regarding all aspects of the airline's operations, it is of interest to note that flightdeck crews were instructed to operate their aircraft in high-speed cruise mode despite the resulting higher [[operating cost]]s due to increased fuel consumption. In an era of low [[aviation fuel#Jet fuel|jet fuel]] prices, this was the most economical option when taking into account the then statutory limit for [[aircrew]] to fly up to 115 hours in 28 days, the fact that engineering costs were charged on a flat hourly basis and that there were generally few opportunities to take advantage of differentials in fuel prices at different stations served by the airline.<ref name="Supertramp_23"/>

In 1964, Brian Lloyd, one of the airline's founders, sold out while well-established Far East trading company Wheelock Marden bought into the company by acquiring a 33% stake in the business. The latter transaction put Wheelock Marden's sales offices in [[Bangkok]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Singapore]] and [[Tokyo]] at the airline's disposal. The same year, Lloyd International acquired its first [[Douglas DC-6]] (an A/B series model), the airline's first [[cabin pressurization|pressurise]]d aircraft. This was also the year the airline's operating base moved from [[Cambridge Airport|Cambridge]] to [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]].<ref name="Supertramp_20"/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200913.html ''Flight International'', 2 April 1964, ''World Airline Survey ...'', p. 518]</ref>

In January 1965, Lloyd International decided to acquire two Bristol Britannia 312s turboprops from [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and to have them fitted with special doors and stronger floors to allow the carriage of large-size palletised freight consignments. The first aircraft joined the fleet in April of that year. [[Aviation Traders]] won the contract to convert the Britannias into freighters. This involved fitting the aircraft with large forward cargo doors and strengthening the cabin floors. Conversion began during the 1965/6 winter season. This enabled the company to concentrate on long-haul charters, especially between [[Europe]] and the Far East. While these aircraft were primarily intended for freight operations, they were also used to transport passengers.<ref name="Lloyd_reequipment"/><ref name="Supertramp_20"/><ref name="ATL_Conversions">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200494.html ''Flight International'', 24 February 1966, ''Far East freighting prospects'', p. 299]</ref>

In 1966, the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) awarded Lloyd International Airways (Hong Kong) Freighters, an associate company of Lloyd International, a licence to operate twice-weekly all-cargo services between Hong Kong and [[London]]. The licence was valid from 1 April 1966, for five years. The same month, the airline sold the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]]A/B that had been acquired 18 months earlier. Nineteen sixty-six was also the year Neckermann und Reisen, the [[tour operator]] of [[West Germany|West German]] mail-order concern [[Arcandor|Neckermann]], contracted Lloyd International to launch a series of weekday IT flights from [[Berlin-Tegel Airport#Other operators|Tegel Airport]] in what used to be [[West Berlin|West Berlin's French sector]] in the days prior to [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]]. These flights were operated with Britannias.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/photo/Lloyd-International-Airways/Bristol-175-Britannia/1238224/L/ Bristol 175 Britannia 312F aircraft (picture)]</ref> They served principal [[Europe]]an holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the [[Canary Islands]]. The combination of these flights with a similar series of weekend IT flights from [[Scotland]] on behalf of a British tour operator fully utilised one Britannia for that summer season.<ref name="Supertramp_22"/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1966/1966%20-%200570.html ''Flight International'', 3 March 1966, ''Lloyd's West German IT deal'', p. 339]</ref>

In 1967, Lloyd International shifted its main operating base from Gatwick to [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]]. The latter also became the location of the airline's headquarters, which had been located in [[Central London]] since its inception.<ref name="Lloyd_69"/>

In 1968, Lloyd International and its associated companies underwent a reorganisation. This resulted in the creation of Lloyd International Airways (Holding) as the group's [[holding company]] with J. Ortiz-Pati<U+00F1>o as chairman. Lloyd International Airways (Holding) acquired the entire share capital of Lloyd International Airways, Lloyd Aircraft Services, Brokaloyd and other associated companies. Effectively, this constituted a transfer of shares from Aviation Management, a company based in Hong Kong, to the new British holding company.<ref name="ownership1"/><ref name="ownership2"/>

In 1969, Lloyd International purchased two former [[British United Airways]] (BUA) Britannia 307s. This doubled the size of the airline's Britannia fleet to four aircraft. These aircraft were fully convertible, with large freight doors. They could either be operated as pure freighters, in a mixed passenger/cargo configuration or as all-passenger aircraft seating up to 132 passengers. The addition of these aircraft gave the airline greater flexibility in its core long-distance charter operation, which mainly consisted of ''ad hoc'' passenger/seamen and cargo flights between Europe and the Far East, primarily to and from Hong Kong. Lloyd International also developed additional sales and promotional facilities on the Europe <U+2014> Hong Kong route in association with the Ben Line, a well-known [[Far East]]ern [[shipping line]],<ref>[http://www.benlineagencies.com/aboutus.asp ''Ben Line Agencies'' - About us]</ref><ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/ben.htm ''The Ships List'', The Fleets, Ben Line / William Thomson & Co.]</ref> to increase air cargo volumes.<ref name="Lloyd_69"/><ref name="BUA_Britannias"/>

Lloyd International's first [[jet aircraft]], an ex-[[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Boeing 707]]-321, entered service in 1970. Lloyd's new long-haul jet operated affinity group flights across the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as well as passenger and freight charters to the Far East.<ref name="Lloyd_69"/><ref name="FarEast_charters"/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200539.html ''Flight International'', 26 March 1970, ''World Airlines 1970'', p. 489]</ref>

In January 1971, Lloyd International entered into an agreement with [[East African Airways]] Corporation (EAAC) to operate scheduled all-cargo services on the latter's behalf between London, [[Dar es Salaam|Dar-es-Salaam]], [[Nairobi]], [[Entebbe]] and [[Lusaka]]. This was also the year the airline acquired two more [[Boeing 707|707]]s, another -321 and a -324C. The latter was a convertible aircraft that could either be operated in an all-passenger, all-cargo or mixed passenger/cargo configuration. It was also the company's first [[turbofan]]-powered jet.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200720.html ''Flight International'', 6 May 1971, ''World Airlines'', p. 635]</ref>

In early-1972 Lloyd International increased its Far East Britannia freight services from six to eight a month, resulting in a twice-weekly operation to Singapore and Hong Kong. The increase in flight frequencies would have boosted annual available cargo capacity to 3.25[[million|m]] [[kilogram|kg]]. This compared with an actual freight volume of 1.5m kg the previous year, representing an average load factor of 79% eastbound and 71% westbound. There was also a plan to operate all Far East freight services with an all-jet fleet entirely composed of convertible, turbofan-powered 707-320Cs by 1975.<ref name="FarEast_boost"/><ref name=Lloyd_72>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%201291.html ''Flight International'', 18 May 1972, ''World Airline Directory'', p. 31]</ref>

Lloyd International's rapidly deteriorating financial performance as a result of cancellations and overcapacity in the low-[[yield (finance)|yield]] [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] affinity group market,<ref>''Fly me, I'm Freddie!'', Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, p. 139</ref> as well as the [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]]'s refusal to direct the [[BAA Limited|British Airports Authority]] (BAA) to reduce airport user charges at Stansted and its preferential treatment of [[British Caledonian#Inception|British Caledonian]] by making it the private sector's "chosen instrument" as part of the official "Second Force" policy, compelled it to cease all operations on 16 June 1972 and to go into [[liquidation]].<ref name="Lloyd_grounding"/><ref name="Lloyd_bankruptcy"/><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%201676.html ''Flight International'', 29 June 1972, ''Sticking up for Stansted'', p. 961]</ref>

==Accidents and incidents==
There is one recorded non-fatal accident involving Lloyd International Airways.<ref name="Lloyd_accident">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%201489.html ''Flight International'', 12 October 1961, ''Air Commerce'', ''Derby Aviation DC-3 accident'', p. 593]</ref><ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=5752 Aviation Safety Network database <U+2013> Lloyd International Airways accidents/incidents]</ref>

On 8 October 1961 a Lloyd International Airways Douglas C-54A-1-DC (registration: G-ARLF) burnt out at [[M<U+00E1>laga Airport]] following the explosion of a petrol tanker during refuelling. The aircraft had arrived at [[M<U+00E1>laga]] from [[Tanger]] and was due to depart to [[Manchester]]. Although it was destroyed as a result of the explosion, none of the 34 passengers who had arrived on board the ill-fated aircraft and the other 32 who were due to join the flight were injured because they were waiting inside the airport building at the time of the accident. However, those who had started their journey in Tanger lost all their luggage.<ref name="Lloyd_accident"/><ref>[http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19611008-0 ASN Aircraft accident description Douglas C-54A-1-DC G-ARLF - M<U+00E1>laga Airport (AGP)]</ref>
