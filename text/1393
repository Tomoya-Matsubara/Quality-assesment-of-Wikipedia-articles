'''Alexander''' ({{lang-el|<U+1F08><U+03BB><U+03AD><U+03BE><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C2>}}, ''Al<U+00E9>xandros''; 1 August 1893 <U+2013> 25 October 1920{{efn|name=dates}}) was [[List of kings of Greece|King]] of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] from 11 June 1917 until his death from the effects of a monkey bite at the age of 27.

The second son of [[Constantine I of Greece]], Alexander was born in the summer palace of [[Tatoi Palace|Tatoi]], on the outskirts of [[Athens]]. He succeeded his father in 1917, during [[World War I]], after the [[Entente Powers]] and the followers of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] pushed Constantine I, and his eldest son [[George II of Greece|Crown Prince George]], into exile. Having no real political experience, the new king was stripped of his powers by the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]] and effectively imprisoned in his own palace. Venizelos, as prime minister, was the effective ruler with the support of the Entente. Though reduced to the status of a puppet king, Alexander supported Greek troops in the war against [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under his reign the territorial extent of Greece considerably increased, following the victory of the Entente and the start of the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919<U+2013>22]].

Alexander controversially married the commoner [[Aspasia Manos]] in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced the couple to leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic [[Barbary macaque]] and died of [[septicemia]]. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival and contributed to the fall of the Venizelist regime. After a [[Greek legislative election, 1920|general election]] and a [[Greek referendum, 1920|referendum]], Constantine I was restored.

==Early life==
Alexander was born at [[Tatoi Palace]] on 1 August 1893 (20 July in the [[Julian calendar]]), the second son of [[Constantine I of Greece|Crown Prince Constantine of Greece]] and his wife [[Sophia of Prussia|Princess Sophia of Prussia]]. He was related to royalty throughout Europe. His father was the eldest son and heir apparent of [[George I of Greece|King George I of Greece]] by his wife [[Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia]]; his mother was the daughter of [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III of Germany]] and his wife [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria, Princess Royal of Great Britain]].<ref>Montgomery-Massingberd, p. 327.</ref> Constantine was a grandson of [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX of Denmark]] and a cousin of both [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]]. Sophia was the sister of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany]], and was also a cousin of King George V through her grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Carter, p. xi</ref>

Clockwise from far left: [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Princess Helen]] (future queen of [[Romania]]), [[George II of Greece|Prince George]] (future King George II), Prince Alexander (future King Alexander), [[Paul of Greece|Prince Paul]] (future King Paul) and [[Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta|Princess Irene]] (future queen of [[Croatia]]). ([[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]] was born after this photograph was taken.)]]

Alexander's early life alternated between the [[Presidential Mansion, Athens|Royal Palace]] in [[Athens]], and Tatoi Palace in the city's suburbs. With his parents he undertook several trips abroad and regularly visited [[Schloss Friedrichshof]], the home of his maternal grandmother, Victoria, Dowager Empress of Germany, who had a particular affection for her Greek grandson.<ref name=vdk62>Van der Kiste, p. 62.</ref>

Though he was very close to his younger sister, [[Helen of Greece and Denmark|Princess Helen]], Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother [[George II of Greece|George]], with whom he had little in common.<ref name="sdm174">S<U+00E1>inz de Medrano, p. 174.</ref> While his elder brother was a serious and thoughtful child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother [[Paul of Greece|Paul]] were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into bramble.<ref name="vdk62"/>

==Military career==
As his father's second son, Alexander was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, George. His education was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany,<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 83.</ref> Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious [[Evelpidon Military Academy]], where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity.<ref name="sdm174"/> He was passionate about cars and motors, and was one of the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.<ref name="vdk113">Van der Kiste, p. 113.</ref>

He distinguished himself in combat during the [[Greece in the Balkan Wars|Balkan Wars]] of 1912<U+2013>13.<ref name="sdm174"/> As a young officer, he was stationed, along with his elder brother, in the field staff of his father; and he accompanied the latter at the head of the [[Army of Thessaly]] during the capture of [[Thessaloniki]] in 1912.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 72.</ref> King George I was assassinated in Thessaloniki soon afterwards, and Alexander's father ascended the throne as Constantine I.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 74<U+2013>75.</ref>

===Courtship of Aspasia Manos===
In 1915, at a party held in Athens by court marshal Theodore [[Ypsilantis]], Alexander became re-acquainted with one of his childhood friends, [[Aspasia Manos]]. She had just returned from education in [[France]] and [[Switzerland]], and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances.<ref name="sdm176">S<U+00E1>inz de Medrano, p. 176.</ref> She was the daughter of Constantine's [[Master of the Horse]],<ref name="vdk117">Van der Kiste, p. 117.</ref> Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten,<ref name="sdm176"/> and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of [[Spetses]] where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons.<ref name="sdm176"/> Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. For King Constantine I and Queen Sophia, however, and much of European society, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.<ref name="sdm177">S<U+00E1>inz de Medrano, p. 177.</ref>

===World War I===
[[File:Constantineiofgreece.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander's father, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], in the uniform of a German field marshal, c. 1913]]
During [[World War I]], Constantine I followed a formal policy of neutrality, yet he was openly benevolent towards [[German Empire|Germany]], which was fighting alongside [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] against the [[Triple Entente]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also become something of a Germanophile following his military training in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the [[Balkans]]. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a [[Movement of National Defence|parallel government to that of the king]].<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 89<U+2013>101.</ref>

Parts of Greece were occupied by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the [[Venizelism|Venizelists]]. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved [[Princess Katherine of Greece and Denmark|Princess Katherine]] by carrying her through the woods for more than two kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 96<U+2013>98.</ref>

Finally on 10 June 1917, [[Charles Jonnart]], the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine to give up his power.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 106.</ref> On the threat of Entente forces landing in [[Piraeus]], the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while determined to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father.<ref name="vdk107">Van der Kiste, p. 107.</ref> Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George]],<ref>Bertin, pp. 215, 220.</ref> but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of [[Crete]] between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne.<ref>Bertin, p. 220.</ref> So, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.<ref name="vdk107"/>

==Reign==
===Accession===
The dismissal of Constantine was not unanimously supported by the Entente powers; while France and Britain did nothing to stop Jonnart's actions, the [[Russian provisional government]] officially protested to Paris.<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, pp. 305<U+2013>307.</ref> [[Petrograd]] demanded that Alexander should not receive the title of king but only that of regent so as to preserve the rights of the deposed sovereign and the Crown Prince. Russia's protests were brushed aside and Alexander ascended the Greek throne.<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, p. 306.</ref>
[[File:<U+0395><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C5><U+03B8><U+03AD><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+0392><U+03B5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03B6><U+03AD><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eleftherios Venizelos]], Greek revolutionary and prime minister, c. 1919]]
Alexander swore the oath of loyalty to the Greek constitution on the afternoon of 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the [[Archbishop of Athens]], Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, [[Alexandros Zaimis]], attended.<ref name="vdk108">Van der Kiste, pp. 107<U+2013>108.</ref> There were no festivities.<ref name="vdk107"/> The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration.<ref name="vdk108"/> He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.<ref name="vdk107"/>

In the evening, after the ceremony, the royal family decided to leave their palace in Athens for [[Tatoi]], but city residents opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 108<U+2013>109.</ref> At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 109.</ref> It was the last time that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family.<ref name="vdk113"/> The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of [[Oropos]] and set off into exile.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 110<U+2013>111.</ref>

===Puppet king===
With his parents and siblings in exile, Alexander found himself isolated. The royals remained unpopular with the Venizelists, and Entente representatives advised the king's aunts and uncles, particularly [[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Prince Nicholas]], to leave. Eventually, they all followed Constantine into exile.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 115.</ref> Royal household staff were gradually replaced by enemies of the former king, and Alexander's allies were either imprisoned or distanced from him. Portraits of the royal family were removed from public buildings, and Alexander's new ministers openly called him the "son of a traitor".<ref name="vdk112">Van der Kiste, p. 112.</ref>

On 26 June 1917, the king was forced to name the republican Eleftherios Venizelos as head of the government. Despite promises given by the Entente on Constantine's departure, the previous prime minister, Zaimis, was effectively forced to resign as Venizelos returned to Athens.<ref name="vdk113"/> Alexander immediately opposed his new prime minister's views and, annoyed by the king's rebuffs, Venizelos threatened to remove him and set up a regency council in the name of Alexander's brother Prince Paul, then still a minor. The Entente powers intervened and asked Venizelos to back down, allowing Alexander to retain the crown.<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, p. 312.</ref> Spied on day and night by the prime minister's supporters, the monarch quickly became a prisoner in his own palace, and his orders went ignored.<ref name="vdk112"/>

Alexander had no experience in affairs of state. However, he was determined to make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could.<ref name="vdk112"/> Effecting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber stamped them.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 114.</ref> His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the [[Macedonian front]] to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the [[Central Powers]], and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.<ref name="vdk119">Van der Kiste, p. 119.</ref>

===Greek expansion===
[[File:Greek history from 1832.GIF|thumb|right|Territorial expansion of Greece between 1832 and 1947]]
By the end of World War I, Greece had grown beyond its 1914 borders, and the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine|treaties of Neuilly]] (1919) and [[Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres|S<U+00E8>vres]] (1920) confirmed the Greek territorial conquests. The majority of [[Thrace]] (previously split between Bulgaria and Turkey) and several [[Aegean Islands]] (such as [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]]) became part of Greece, and the region of [[Smyrna]], in [[Ionia]], was placed under Greek [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]].<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, pp. 382<U+2013>384.</ref> Alexander's kingdom increased in size by around a third. Venizelos took most of the credit, and left for Paris to take part in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace negotiations]] with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Upon his return to Greece in August 1920, Venizelos received a laurel crown from the king for his work in support of [[panhellenism]].<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, p. 387.</ref>

Despite their territorial gains following the Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped to achieve the ''[[Megali Idea]]'' and annex [[Constantinople]] and larger areas of Ottoman [[Asia Minor]]; they invaded [[Anatolia]] beyond Smyrna and sought to take [[Ankara]], with the aim of destroying the Turkish resistance led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat<U+00FC>rk|Mustafa Kemal]] (later known as Atat<U+00FC>rk).<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, p. 386.</ref> Thus began the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919<U+2013>22)]]. Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atat<U+00FC>rk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.{{efn|name=Lausanne|The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923 redrew the boundary between Turkey and Greece back in favor of Turkey.<ref>Driault and Lh<U+00E9>ritier, pp. 433<U+2013>434.</ref>}}

==Marriage==
===Controversy===
On 12 June 1917, the day after his accession, Alexander revealed his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait until the end of the war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 117<U+2013>118.</ref> In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated.<ref name="vdk113"/> Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.<ref name="vdk118"/>

The ruling dynasty of Greece was of German-Danish origin and Constantine and Sophia were seen as far too German by the Venizelists, but even though the marriage of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms that it was a foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner.<ref name="ls136">Llewellyn Smith, p. 136.</ref> Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos,<ref name="sdm176"/> the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular in the eyes of the people.<ref name="vdk118">Van der Kiste, p. 118.</ref>{{efn|name=opinions|According to [[Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark]], Venizelos "encouraged the marriage [of Alexander and Aspasia] to acquire political advantage for himself and his party by bringing the royal family thus into disrepute."<ref>Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, "Comments by HRH Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark" in: Fleming, Patricia H. (June 1973). "The Politics of Marriage Among Non-Catholic European Royalty". ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 14, no. 3, p. 246.</ref> However, [[Philip Noel-Baker, Baron Noel-Baker#Private life|Irene Noel Baker]] told her father-in-law, British MP [[Joseph Allen Baker]], that Venizelos was "personally in favour of the marriage [but] is sincerely convinced that it will be extremely unpopular".<ref>Quoted in Llewellyn Smith, p. 357</ref>}}

When [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], visited Athens in March 1918, to confer the [[Order of the Bath]] upon the king, Alexander feared that a marriage between him and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Princess Mary of the United Kingdom]] would be discussed as part of an attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself.<ref name="vdk118"/> For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive.<ref name="sdm177"/> The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.<ref name="ls136"/>

Alexander's parents were not so happy about the match. Sophia disapproved of her son marrying a commoner, while Constantine wanted a delay but was prepared to be his son's best man if Alexander would be patient.<ref name="vdk118"/> Alexander visited Paris at the end of 1918, raising hopes among his family that they would be able to contact him once he was outside Greece. When Queen Sophia attempted to telephone her son in his Parisian hotel, a minister intercepted the call and informed her that "His Majesty is sorry, but he cannot respond to the telephone".<ref name="vdk117"/> He was not even informed that she had called.<ref name="vdk117"/>

===Public scandal===
[[File:King Alexander of Greece and Aspasia Manos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aspasia Manos]] and King Alexander depicted at the wheel of his [[Packard]] in a contemporary lithograph]]
With the help of Aspasia's brother-in-law, Christo Zalocostas, and after three unsuccessful attempts, the couple eventually married in secret before a royal chaplain, [[Archimandrite]] Zacharistas, on the evening of 17 November 1919.<ref name="sdm177"/> After the ceremony, the archimandrite was sworn to silence but soon broke his promise by confessing to the Archbishop of Athens, [[Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople|Meletius Metaxakis]].<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 118<U+2013>119.</ref> According to the Greek constitution, members of the royal family had to obtain permission to marry from both the sovereign and the head of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 120<U+2013>121.</ref> By marrying Aspasia without the permission of the Archbishop, Alexander was to cause a major scandal.<ref name="vdk119"/>

Despite his disapproval of the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia and her mother to move into the Royal Palace on condition that the marriage remain secret.<ref name="sdm177"/> The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they did not attend official functions together.<ref name="vdk119"/> On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near [[Fontainebleau]], the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car,<ref>"The King in a Motor Accident", ''[[The Times]]'', 29 May 1920, p. 13.</ref> while Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.<ref>"[http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1707255 Narrow Escape While Motoring]", ''[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]'', 31 May 1920, p. 8.</ref>{{efn|name=kergariou|Count Alain de Kergariou (died 29 May 1920 aged 38) was an officer in the [[French Air Service]] during World War I.<ref>"Count de Kergariou Dead", ''The Times'', 31 May 1920, p. 13.</ref> He was motoring with his wife and two stepsons, the princes de Tonnay-Charente, when the accident happened.

The government allowed the couple to return to Greece in mid-1920. Although their marriage was legalized, Aspasia was not recognized as queen, but was instead known as "Madame Manos".<ref name="vdk119"/> At first, she stayed at her sister's house in the Greek capital before transferring to Tatoi,<ref>S<U+00E1>inz de Medrano, p. 178.</ref> and it was during this period that she became pregnant with Alexander's child.<ref name="vdk119"/>

Alexander visited the newly acquired territories of [[West Thrace]], and on 8 July 1920 the new name for the region's main town<U+2014>[[Alexandroupoli]] (meaning "city of Alexander" in Greek)<U+2014>was announced in the king's presence. The city's previous name of Dedeagatch was considered too Turkish.<ref>Kargakos, pp. 325<U+2013>331</ref> On 7 September, Venizelos, counting on a surge of support in the wake of the signing of the Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres and the expansion of Greek territory, announced a general election for early November.<ref>Llewellyn Smith, p. 135.</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Queen Sofia of Greece.jpg|thumb|Alexander's mother, [[Queen Sophia of Greece]], by [[Georgios Jakobides]], 1915]]
On 2 October 1920, Alexander was injured while walking through the grounds of the Tatoi estate. A domestic [[Barbary macaque]] belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's [[German Shepherd]], Fritz,{{efn|name=dog|The dog had been found in an enemy trench during World War I by a British officer, who had presented it to Alexander as a gift.<ref name="vdk119"/>}} and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. In doing so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys (which were later destroyed),<ref>"Monkey Bites King of Greece", ''[[The Portsmouth Herald]]'', 14 October 1920, p.1; Van der Kiste, p. 122.</ref> and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not [[cauterize]]d. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 122<U+2013>123.</ref>

That evening, his wounds became infected; he suffered a strong fever and [[septicemia]] set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished to take responsibility for so drastic an act.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 123.</ref> On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Olga]], widow of George I of Greece and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of [[sepsis]] twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 123<U+2013>124.</ref> The other members of the royal family received the news by telegram that night.{{efn|name=death|[[Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark|Prince Nicolas]] received the news first but did not communicate it to Alexander's parents until the next morning because he did not wish to disturb their rest.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 124.</ref>}}

Two days later, Alexander's body was conveyed to [[Athens Cathedral]] where it lay in state, until his funeral on 29 October. Once again, the Greek royals were refused permission to return to Greece, and Queen Olga was the only member of the family who attended (except Aspasia<ref>S<U+00E1>inz de Medrano, p. 179.</ref>).<ref name="vdk125"/> Foreign powers were represented by the [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Prince Regent of Serbia]] with his sister [[Princess Helen of Serbia|Princess John Constantinovich of Russia]], the [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince of Sweden]] with his uncle [[Prince Eugen, Duke of N<U+00E4>rke|Prince Eugene, Duke of Nericia]], and Rear-Admirals [[George Hope (Royal Navy officer)|Sir George Hope]] of Britain and Dumesnil of France, as well as members of the Athens diplomatic corps.<ref>"Royal Funeral in Athens", ''The Times'', 2 November 1920, p. 11.</ref>

After the cathedral service, Alexander's body was interred on the grounds of the royal estate at Tatoi.<ref name="vdk125">Van der Kiste, p. 125.</ref> The Greek royal family never regarded Alexander's reign as fully legitimate. In the royal cemetery, while other monarchs are given the inscription "King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark", Alexander's reads "Alexander, son of the King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark. He ruled in the place of his father from 14 June 1917 to 25 October 1920."<ref name="vdk125"/> According to Alexander's favorite sister, Queen Helen of Romania, this feeling of illegitimacy was also shared by Alexander himself; a sentiment that helps explain his m<U+00E9>salliance with Aspasia Manos.<ref name="vdk118" />

[[File:Laszlo - Queen Olga of Greece.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander's paternal grandmother, [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga of Greece]], by [[Philip Alexius de L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3>]], 1914. She acted as regent between his death and the restoration of his father.]]
Alexander's death raised questions about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage{{efn|name=marriage|Here "unequal marriage" refers to the union between a person of royal rank with an individual of a "lower" social status. This is similar to the [[morganatic marriage]]s of other European countries, though this concept did not exist in Greece.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 120.</ref>}} his descendants were not in the line of succession.{{efn|name=succession|The restored King Constantine did not recognize Alexander's only child, [[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Alexandra]], as a member of the House of Greece until July 1922. However, as the Greek succession was governed by [[Salic law]] until the beginning of the reign of [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]], she would not have been eligible as a female anyway.<ref>S<U+00E1>inz de Medrano, pp. 180, 238, 402.</ref>}} The [[Hellenic Parliament]] demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting under the direction of the Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul.<ref>Van der Kiste, pp. 125<U+2013>126.</ref> Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.<ref>Llewellyn Smith, p. 139; Van der Kiste, p. 126.</ref>

The throne remained vacant and the [[Greek legislative election, 1920|legislative elections of 1920]] turned into an open conflict between the Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine.<ref>Llewellyn Smith, pp. 144<U+2013>148; Van der Kiste, p. 126.</ref> On 14 November 1920, with the war with Turkey dragging on, the monarchists won, and [[Dimitrios Rallis]] became prime minister; Venizelos (who lost his own parliamentary seat) chose to leave Greece in self-exile. Rallis asked the widowed Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine's return.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 126.</ref> Under the restored King Constantine I, whose return was endorsed overwhelmingly in a [[Greek referendum, 1920|referendum]], Greece went on to lose the Greco-Turkish War with heavy military and civilian casualties. The territory gained on the Turkish mainland during Alexander's reign was lost. Historians postulate that Alexander's death in the midst of an election campaign helped destabilize the Venizelos regime and the resultant loss of Allied support contributed to the failure of Greece's territorial ambitions.<ref>Fry, Goldstein and Langhorne, p. 201; Goldstein, p. 49.</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] wrote, "it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite."<ref>Churchill, p. 409, quoted (for example) in Pentzopoulos, p. 39.</ref>

===Issue===
Alexander's daughter by Aspasia Manos, [[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark]] (1921<U+2013>1993), was born five months after his death. Her mother, Madame Manos, was granted the style "Princess Alexander" by the restored King Constantine at Queen Sophia's insistence.<ref>Van der Kiste, p. 132.</ref> Alexandra married King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia]] (1923<U+2013>1970), and had one child by him: [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia]] (born 1945).<ref>Montgomery-Massingberd, pp. 327, 536, 544</ref>
