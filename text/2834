'''The history of universities in Scotland''' includes the development of all universities and university colleges in Scotland, between their foundation between the fifteenth century and the present day. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, or to the Continent. This situation was transformed by the founding of [[St John's College, St Andrews]] in 1418 by [[Henry Wardlaw]], bishop of St. Andrews. [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews|St Salvator's College]] was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the [[University of Glasgow]] being founded in 1451 and [[King's College, Aberdeen]] in 1495. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen. International contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century.

[[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]] was founded in Aberdeen in 1511 and St John's College as [[St Mary's College, St Andrews]] was re-founded in 1538, as a Humanist academy for the training of clerics. Public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s would eventually become the University of Edinburgh in 1582. After the Reformation, Scotland's universities underwent a series of reforms associated with [[Andrew Melville]], who was influenced by the anti-Aristotelian [[Pierre Ramus]]. In 1617 James IV decreed that the town college of Edinburgh should be known as King James's College. In 1641, the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (r. 1625-49), to form the "King Charles University of Aberdeen". Under the [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] (1652<U+2013>60), the universities saw an improvement in their funding. After the [[Restoration in Scotland|Restoration]] there was a purge of Presbyterians from the universities, but most of the intellectual advances of the preceding period were preserved. The colleges at St. Andrews were demerged. The five Scottish university colleges recovered from the disruption of the civil war years and Restoration with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high-quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry.

In the eighteenth century the universities went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres at the forefront of Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Chairs of medicine were founded at all the university towns. By the 1740s Edinburgh medical school was the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic world. Access to Scottish universities was probably more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the [[European Enlightenment]]. Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications. The curriculum was dominated by divinity and the law and there was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum, particularly by introducing degrees in the physical sciences and the need to reform the system to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. The result of these reforms was a revitalisation of the Scottish university system, which expanded to 6,254 students by the end of the century and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. After the [[Robbins Report]] of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. New universities included the [[University of Dundee]], [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]], [[Heriot-Watt University|Heriot-Watt]], [[University of Stirling|Stirling]]. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector and by the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], the distinction between universities and colleges was removed, creating new universities at [[Abertay University|Abertay]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[Napier University|Napier]], [[Paisley University|Paisley]] and [[Robert Gordon University|Robert Gordon]].

====Background====
[[File:John Mair.jpg|thumb|[[John Mair]], one of the most successful products of the Medieval Scottish educational system]]
From the end of the eleventh century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine.<ref>I. Wei, "The rise of universities" in A. MacKay, ed., ''Atlas of Medieval Europe'' (London: Routledge, 1997), ISBN 0415019230, pp. 241<U+2013>3.</ref> Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> Among the destinations [[University of Paris|Paris]] was the most important, but also [[University of Cologne|Cologne]], [[University of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Orl<U+00E9>ans]], [[University of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], [[Old University of Leuven|Louvain]] and [[University of Vienna|Vienna]].<ref name=Wormald1991pp68-72>J.

Among these travelling scholars, the most important intellectual figure was [[John Duns Scotus]] (c. 1266<U+2013>1308), who studied at Oxford, Cambridge and Paris. He probably died at Cologne in 1308, after becoming a major influence on late medieval religious thought.<ref name=Websterp119>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0-333-56761-7, p. 119.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Wars of Independence]] (1296<U+2013>1357), with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant.<ref name=Websterpp124-5>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0-333-56761-7, pp. 124<U+2013>5.</ref> Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. At Paris, this included [[John de Rait]] (died c.  1355) and [[Walter Wardlaw]] (died c. 1387) in the 1340s and 1350s, William de Tredbrum in the 1380s and Laurence de Lindores (1372<U+2013>1437) in the early 1500s.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish [[nominalists]] at Paris in the early sixteenth century, of which [[John Mair]] (1467<U+2013>1550) was the most important figure. He had probably studied at a Scottish grammar school and then Cambridge, before moving to Paris where he matriculated in 1493.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/>

====First Scottish universities====
[[File:Henry Wardlaw.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bust of Bishop [[Henry Wardlaw]], founder of St. Andrews University]]
This situation was transformed by the founding of [[St John's College, St Andrews]] in 1418. [[Henry Wardlaw]], bishop of St. Andrews, petitioned the anti-Pope [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] during the later stages of the [[Western Schism|Great Western Schism]], when Scotland was one of his few remaining supporters. Wardlaw argued that Scottish scholars in other universities were being persecuted for their loyalty to the anti-Pope.<ref>P. Daileader, "Local experiences of the Great Western Schism", in J. Rollo-Koster and T. M. Izbicki, eds, ''A Companion to the Great Western Schism (1378<U+2013>1417)'' (BRILL, 2009), ISBN 9004162771, p. 119.</ref> [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews|St Salvator's College]] was added to St. Andrews in 1450.

Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), ISBN 0-19-211696-7, pp. 610<U+2013>12.</ref> St. Andrews was deliberately modelled on Paris, and although Glasgow adopted the statues of the [[University of Bologna]], there, like Aberdeen, there was an increasing Parisian influence, partly because all its early regents had been educated in Paris.<ref>A. Broadie, ''A History of Scottish Philosophy'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), ISBN 0748616284, p. 34.</ref> Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars still needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, Scottish scholars continued to visit the Continent and returned to English universities after they reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/>

By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioning some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifesting itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language.<ref>W. R<U+00FC>egg, "The rise of Humanism", in Hilde de Ridder-Symoens, ed., ''A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), ISBN 0521541131, pp. 452<U+2013>9.</ref> However, in this period, Scottish universities largely had a Latin curriculum, designed for the clergy, [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[canon law|common lawyers]]. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new Humanist scholarship, focusing on [[metaphysics]] and putting a largely unquestioning faith in the works of [[Aristotle]], whose authority would be challenged in the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=Wormald1991pp183-4>J.

He transferred to St. Andrews in 1523 and in 1533 he was made Provost of St Salvator's College. While in Scotland his students included [[John Knox]] and [[George Buchanan]].<ref>A.

Reid was also instrumental in organising the public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s on law, Greek, Latin and philosophy, under the patronage of the queen consort [[Mary of Guise]]. These developed into the "Tounis College" of the city, which would eventually become the University of Edinburgh.<ref name=Thomas2012pp196-7/>

====Reformation====
{{See also|Scottish Reformation}}
In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a [[Protestant Reformation]] that rejected Papal authority and many aspects of Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] national church, known as the [[Church of Scotland|kirk]], which was strongly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them.<ref>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470<U+2013>1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0748602763, pp. 102-4.</ref> After the Reformation, Scotland's universities underwent a series of reforms associated with [[Andrew Melville]], who returned from Geneva to become principal of the University of Glasgow in 1574. A distinguished linguist, philosopher and poet, he had trained in Paris and studied law at [[University of Poitiers|Poitiers]], before moving to Geneva and developing an interest in Protestant theology. Influenced by the anti-Aristotelian [[Pierre Ramus]], he placed an emphasis on simplified logic and elevated languages and sciences to the same status as philosophy, allowing accepted ideas in all areas to be challenged.<ref name=Wormald1991pp183-4/> He introduced new specialist teaching staff, replacing the system of "regenting", where one tutor took the students through the entire arts curriculum.<ref>J.

King James IV's major contribution to the universities was to combat militant [[Presbyterian]]ism by insisting that the catechism ''God and the King'' must be read in the schools and universities. He also decreed, in 1617, that the town college of Edinburgh should be known as King James's College.<ref>J.

Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures.<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/> The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] (1694<U+2013>1746), who held the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1729 to 1746. He was a moral philosopher who produced alternatives to the ideas of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. One of his major contributions to world thought was the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] and [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] principle that virtue is that which provides, "the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers". Much of what is incorporated in the [[scientific method]] (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between [[science]] and [[religion]] were developed by his prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s [[David Hume]] (1711<U+2013>76) and [[Adam Smith]] (1723-90).<ref name="Denby">{{Citation | last= | title = The Scottish enlightenment and the challenges for Europe in the 21st century; climate change and energy  | journal = The New Yorker | date = 11 October 2004 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/10/11/041011crat_atlarge| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5z3E5hVjt| archivedate =17 May 2011}}.</ref> [[Hugh Blair]] (1718<U+2013>1800) was a minister of the Church of Scotland and held the Chair of Rhetoric and [[Belles Lettres]] at the University of Edinburgh.

====Nineteenth century====

[[File:Marischalcollege1.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Marischal College with the new front under construction; c. 1900]]
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had about 3,000 students between them.<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/> They had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications.<ref name=Anderson2003p224/> Although Scottish universities had gained a formidable reputation in the eighteenth century, the curriculum was dominated by divinity and the law and there was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum, particularly by introducing degrees in the physical sciences and the need to reform the system to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions.<ref name=Anderson2003p224/> The result was two commissions of inquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858|1858]] and [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1889|1889]].<ref name=Anderson2003p224/>

The curriculum and system of graduation were reformed. Entrance examinations that were equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered three-year ordinary and four-year honours degrees.<ref name=Anderson2003p224>R. Anderson, "The history of Scottish education pre-1980", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), ISBN 0-7486-1625-X, p. 224.</ref> There was resistance among professors, particularly among chairs of divinity and classics, to the introduction of new subjects, especially the physical sciences. The crown established [[Regius Professor|Regius chair]]s, all in the sciences, including medicine, chemistry, natural history and botany. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow was the first of its kind in the world. By the 1870s the physical sciences were well established in Scottish universities, whereas in England the battle to modernise the curriculum would not be complete until the end of the century.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50>O.

They were given [[University Court|Courts]], which included external members and who oversaw the finances of the institution.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/> [[Students' Representative Council]]s were founded in 1884 and ratified under the 1889 act.<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/> Under this act new arts subjects were established, with chairs in Modern History, French, German and Political Economy.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/>

[[File:University, Glasgow, Scotland, ca. 1895.jpg|thumb|left|The new buildings of the [[University of Glasgow]] at Gilmorehill, c. 1895]]
The University of St Andrews was at a low point in its fortunes in the early part of the century. It was restructured by commissioners appointed under the 1858 act and began a revival.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/> It pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the [[Lady Literate in Arts]] (LLA) in 1882, which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could all admit and graduate women, with St Andrews the first to do so, and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased from this point until the early twentieth century.<ref name=Rayner-Canham2008>M.

L. Robertson, "The Development of an Urban University: Glasgow, 1860<U+2013>1914", ''History of Education Quarterly'', Winter 1990, vol. 30 (1), pp. 47-78.</ref> It moved from the city centre to a new set of grand [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] buildings, paid for largely by public subscription, at Gilmorehill in 1870.<ref name=Devine1996p249>T. M. Devine, ''Glasgow: 1830 to 1912'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1996), ISBN 0719036925, p. 249.</ref> The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1860. Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/> Unlike the other Medieval and ecclesiastical foundations, because the [[University of Edinburgh]] was a civic college it was relatively poor. In 1858 it was taken out of the care of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/>

The result of these reforms was a revitalisation of the Scottish university system, which expanded to 6,254 students by the end of the century<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/> and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow became highly distinguished under its second incumbent [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] (1820<U+2013>72), who held the position from 1859 to 1872 and became the leading figure in [[heat engine]]s and founder president of the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]].<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/> [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]] (1773<U+2013>1852) was the first Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow and in 1831 founded the Shuttle Street laboratories, perhaps the first of their kind in the world. His students founded practical chemistry at Aberdeen soon after. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy at Glasgow aged only 22. His work included the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]]. By 1870&nbsp;Kelvin and Rankine had made Glasgow the leading centre of science and engineering education and investigation in Britain.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/>

At Edinburgh, major figures included [[David Brewster]] (1781<U+2013>1868), who made contributions to the science of optics and to the development of photography. [[Fleeming Jenkin]] (1833<U+2013>85) was the first professor of engineering at the university and among wide interests helped develop ocean telegraphs and mechanical drawing.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989pp147-50/> In medicine [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] (1827<U+2013>1912) and his student [[William Macewen]] (1848<U+2013>1924), pioneered antiseptic surgery.<ref name=Checkland&Checkland1989p151>O.

====Twentieth century to the present====
{{Main|Education in Scotland in the twentieth century}}
[[File:University of Stirling from Wallace Monument.jpg|thumb|left|The purpose-built modern buildings of the [[University of Stirling]]]]
From 1901 large numbers of students received bursaries from the [[Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland|Carnegie Trust]].<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/> By 1913 there were 7,776 students in Scottish universities. Of these 1,751 (23 per cent) were women. By the mid-1920s it had risen to a third. It then fell to 25-7 per cent in the 1930s as opportunities in school teaching, virtually the only careers outlet for female graduates in arts and sciences, decreased. No woman was appointed to a Scottish professorship until after 1945.<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/> The fall in numbers was most acute among women students, but it was part of a general trend. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment to subjects in which Scotland had been traditionally strong, such as science and engineering. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the number of full-time students fell from 10,400 in 1924 to 9,900 in 1937. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.<ref name=Harvie1998pp78-9>C. Harvie, ''No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-Century Scotland'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 3rd edn., 1998), ISBN 0-7486-0999-7, pp. 78-9.</ref>

Before the First World War relationships between male and female students tended to be very formal, but in the inter-war years there was an increase in social activities, such as [[dance hall]]s, cinemas, cafes and public houses. From the 1920s much drunken and high spirited activity was diverted into the annual charity gala or [[Rag (student society)|rag]]. Male centred activities included the Student's Union, Rugby Club and [[Officers' Training Corps#Scotland|Officers' Training Corps]]. Women had their own unions and athletics clubs. Universities remained largely non-residential, although a few women's halls of residence were created, most not owned by the universities.<ref name=Anderson2001pp612-14/>

[[Image:abertaylib.jpg|thumb|right|The student library at [[Abertay University]]]]
After the [[Robbins Report]] of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. The [[University of Dundee]] was demerged from St. Andrews, [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] and [[Heriot-Watt University|Heriot-Watt]] developing from technical colleges and the [[University of Stirling|Stirling]] was begun as a completely new university on a [[greenfield land|greenfield]] site in 1966. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector of educational and technical colleges, which were cheaper because they undertook little research. By the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], the distinction between universities and colleges was removed.<ref name=Paterson2001pp614-5>L. Paterson, "Universities: 3. post-Robbins", in M. Lynch, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), ISBN 0-19-211696-7, pp. 614-5.</ref> This created new universities at [[Abertay University|Abertay]], [[Glasgow Caledonian University|Glasgow Caledonian]], [[Napier University|Napier]], [[Paisley University|Paisley]] and [[Robert Gordon University|Robert Gordon]].<ref>R. Shaw, "Institutional and curricular structures in the universities of Scotland" in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), ISBN 0-7486-1625-X, pp. 664-5.</ref> Despite the expansion the number of male students experienced a downturn in growth from 1971 to 1990. The growth in female student numbers was much larger and continued until, by 1999 and 2000, the numbers of women students exceeded male students for the first time.<ref>C. G.

After devolution, in 1999 the new [[Scottish Executive]] set up an Education Department and an [[Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department (Scotland)|Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department]], which together took over its functions.<ref name=Fairley2003>J.

In 2008-09, approximately 231,000 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56 per cent were female and 44 per cent male.<ref>Scottish Government, [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/03/18144043/1 Statistics Publication Notice Lifelong Learning Series: Students In Higher Education At Scottish Institutions]'' (2001), retrieved 25 May 2011.</ref>
