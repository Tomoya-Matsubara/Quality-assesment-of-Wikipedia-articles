Prior to signing with a [[record label]], Rihanna was discovered by record producer [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Evan Rogers]], who helped Rihanna record [[Demo (music)|demo tapes]] which could be sent out to potential record labels. After Rihanna was signed by [[Jay-Z]], the former [[Chief executive officer]] (CEO) and president of Def Jam, she continued to work with Rogers and his production partner [[Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers|Carl Sturken]], as well as working with other producers for her debut album. ''Music of the Sun'' was recorded between 2004 and 2005. The album features vocals from artists including [[Kardinal Offishall]], [[J-Status]], and [[Vybz Kartel]]. As an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] album, ''Music of the Sun'' incorporates musical elements of [[dance-pop]] and [[caribbean music]] genres such as [[dancehall]] and [[reggae]].

The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented its dancehall and Caribbean-inspired songs, while others criticized some of the production. ''Music of the Sun'' debuted at number 10 on the United States (U.S.) [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number six on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. The album peaked in the top-40 of album charts in Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] praised ''Music of the Sun'' and awarded it 3.5 stars out of 5; Birchmeier commented that the album presents Rihanna as "winsome rather than [a] wannabe," as well as how she managed to set herself apart from other dance-pop artists such as [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]], [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] and [[Ciara]].<ref name="Allmusic1"/> Birchmeier further stated that "''Music of the Sun'' descends into faceless slow jams after a while, overall consistency not being among its attributes, but thankfully it picks up the pace toward the end&nbsp;... the result is one of the more engaging urban dance-pop albums of the year."<ref name="Allmusic1"/> Chantal Jenoure of ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'' gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5, and praised the dancehall and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] composition on several of the songs, including "Pon de Replay", "Rush", "Let Me", "Music of the Sun" and "That La La La", writing that they make the listener feel "happy" and "carefree".<ref name="Jenoure"/>

Kelefa Sanneh of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave ''Music of the Sun'' a "mixed" rating; Sanneh praised Rihanna for combining dancehall and reggae genres with that of more popular and mainstream ones, noting that the combination between dancehall and [[Pop music|pop]] resulted in "[Pon de Replay being] one [of] the summer's biggest and most seductive club tracks."<ref name="Sanneh"/> However, Sanneh noted that Rihanna sounds "stranded" when there is not a beat to sing along to.<ref name="Sanneh"/> Liam Colle praised the album and its Caribbean infused beats and gave ''Music of the Sun'' a rating of 5 out of 10.<ref name="Colle"/> Barry Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated it 2.5 out of 5 stars and described the album as lacking the replay value, ingenuity and rhythm of the single with "generic [[vocal hiccups]] and frills" of US R&B inflecting upon her "Caribbean charm".<ref name="Walters"/> Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] awarded the album 2.5 stars out of 5, describing the album as a "glut of teen R&B chanteuses" and described the lead single "Pon de Replay" as "a dancehall-pop mixture that owes plenty of its sweat and shimmy to Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles' "[[Baby Boy (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Baby Boy]]".<ref name="Cinquemani"/> Evan Serpick of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was critical of ''Music of the Sun'' and rated it as a C grade album, writing "The 17-year-old's vibrant vocals lift tracks like 'That La La La' and 'Let Me,' but this bland dancehall/R&B debut is filled with chintzy production and maudlin arrangements that block out the Music of the Sun."<ref name="Serpick"/>
