{{nihongo|'''Lucario'''|<U+30EB><U+30AB><U+30EA><U+30AA>|Rukario|}} is a [[List of Pok<U+00E9>mon|Pok<U+00E9>mon species]] in [[Nintendo]] and [[Game Freak]]'s ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'' franchise. Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Lucario first appeared in the video games [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], also appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Lucario is voiced by [[Daisuke Namikawa]] in Japanese, and [[Bill Rogers (voice actor)|Bill Rogers]] in English.

Known as the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew#Aura|Aura]] Pok<U+00E9>mon it can track energy called Aura, which is given off by all living creatures. It is featured on the boxart for [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]], and has a staring role in the film ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''. Lucario is also featured as a playable character in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. [[IGN]] called its presence in ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' "a bit on the head scratching side", although another editor stated that it would make sense for ''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' to be represented by a fighting-type Pok<U+00E9>mon.

==Concept and creation==
The design and art direction for Lucario was provided by [[Ken Sugimori]], a friend of the creator of the [[Pokemon video game series|''Pok<U+00E9>mon'' games]], [[Satoshi Tajiri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965 |title=Game Freak on Pok<U+00E9>mon! |author=Stuart Bishop |publisher=CVG |date=2003-05-30 |accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT|archivedate=2008-02-08}}</ref> The species first appeared in the [[Nintendo DS]] games, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl]]'', released in [[Japan]] in 2006. In an interview, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon Diamond and Pearl]]'' director [[Junichi Masuda]] noted Lucario's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/previews/209340/pokemon-platinum-developer-interview-pt-2/ |publisher=''[[GamePro]]'' |title=Pokemon Platinum: Developer Interview! |date=2009-03-23 |accessdate=2009-06-09 |author=Noble, McKinley}}</ref>

Lucario is a [[bipedal]], [[jackal]]-like Pok<U+00E9>mon that is around four feet in height. Lucario's forepaws are black and have one white spike on each arm on the upper-side of its wrists. In addition, there is a third spike on Lucario's chest. Lucario's snout and ears have also grown longer since its evolution from Riolu. Lucario also has a furry yellow torso, and its thighs are in the shape of what looks like blue shorts. It has the ability to sense the aura in all living things, and the one featured in the film is capable of telepathic human speech,<ref name="dexlucario1">'''Pok<U+00E9>dex:''' It has the ability to sense the Auras of all things.

DOJO!! http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/hidden06.html</ref> Lucario can use moves such as Aura Sphere, Force Palm, ExtremeSpeed, Double Team, and his "Final Smash", Aura Storm. When using its Final Smash, it launches a powerful Aura attack in which you have to change its angle.<ref>Lucario's All-Star Mode trophy information in Super Smash Bros Brawl.</ref> Lucario's fighting style revolves around Aura manipulation and the concept of "high risk, high return"; the more damage Lucario has taken, the stronger it and its attacks become.

===In the anime===
Lucario's main role in the anime is his appearance in the eighth Pok<U+00E9>mon movie, ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''. In the movie, Lucario is a servant to a nobleman named [[Sir Aaron]] in a [[Renaissance]]-themed city called Cameron Palace. Aaron had trained this Lucario to manipulate aura. Lucario thinks of Sir Aaron as both his master and close friend. After Aaron traps him in a magic staff at the film's outset, Lucario begins questioning any [[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]-human relationship. Lucario demonstrates an adeptness to [[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew#Aura|Aura]]. The Lucario in the movie, voiced by [[Sean Schemmel]], can also speak human languages without telepathy, the fifth speaking non-legendary Pok<U+00E9>mon after [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]]'s [[Meowth]]. Lucario sacrificed himself in order to save the Tree of Beginning, though the credits showed him with Sir Aaron eating a chocolate bar.<ref name="Lucario and the Mystery of Mew">{{cite video|date=July 18, 1998|title=[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]|format=DVD|publisher=[[VIZ Media]]|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref><!-- This references the entire pharagraph -->
