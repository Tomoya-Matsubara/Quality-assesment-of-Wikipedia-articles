'''German submarine ''U-203''''' was a [[German Type VIIC submarine]] [[U-boat]] built for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[Kriegsmarine]] for service during [[World War II]].<ref name="uboat.net"/> 

Built as 'Werk' 632 of [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] AG in [[Kiel]], she was laid down on 28 March 1940, launched on 4 January 1941 and commissioned on 18 February under ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' Rolf M<U+00FC>tzelburg.

''U-203'' carried out eleven patrols with the first flotilla and is credited with sinking 21 ships for 94,270 [[Gross Register Tonnage|GRT]] and damaging a further three for 17,052 GRT. She was a member of eleven [[Wolf pack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s.

She was sunk by British carrier-borne aircraft and a British warship southeast of [[Greenland]] in April 1943.

==Service Record==
===1st, 2nd and 3rd patrols===
On 24 June 1941, nineteen days into her first patrol while ''en route'' from [[Kiel]] to [[St. Nazaire]] in France, ''U-203'' attacked and sank the GRT 4,956 GRT British merchant ship ''Kinross'', which was part of [[List of World War II convoys|Convoy OB-336]]. Later that day, she attacked the 4,402 GRT Norwegian vessel ''Sol<U+00F8>y'', which was with [[List of World War II convoys|Convoy HX-133]].<br>

Arriving at St. Nazaire on 29 June, the crew of ''U-203'' stayed ashore for another eleven days before the boat made her second patrol. Seventeen days into it, she attacked [[List of World War II convoys|Convoy OG-69]] which was sailing to Gibraltar. On the 27th, ''U-203'' sank the 2,475 GRT British merchant ship ''Hawkinge''. The British ''Lapland'' and the Swedish ''Norita'', also OG-69 merchant ships, were sunk the following day, adding a further 1,330 GRT and 1,516 GRT respectively to the U-boat's record.

Six days into her third patrol, on 26 September, the British ships ''Avoceta'', ''Lapwing'' and the Norwegian ''Varanberg'' of [[List of World War II convoys|Convoy HG-73]] were sunk, destroying another 7,362 GRT of shipping.

===4th, 5th and 6th patrols===
Sixteen days into her fourth patrol, on 3 November, ''U-203'' attacked and sank the ''[[List of Empire ships (G)#Empire Gemsbuck|Empire Gemsbuck]]'' (5,626 GRT)  and the ''Everoja'' (4,830 GRT), British merchant ships of [[List of World War II convoys|Convoy SC-52]].

Twenty-one days into her fifth patrol on 15 January 1942, ''U-203'' sank a small (632 GRT) Portuguese ship, the ''Catalina''. Two days later, the Norwegian ship ''Octavian'' would also be sunk. Four torpedoes were fired at the Canadian ship ''North Gaspe'', which survived the attack. One torpedo detonated close to the ship, but none actually hit.

''U-203''{{'}}s sixth patrol resulted in a total loss of 14,232 GRT to the Allies and two additional ships damaged, including the British merchant vessels ''San Delfino'' and ''[[List of Empire ships (Th<U+2013>Ty)#Empire Thrush|Empire Thrush]]''. Damaged were the American tanker ''Henry F. Sinclair, Jr.'' and the Panamanian flagged tanker ''Stanvac Melbourne''.

===7th, 8th and 9th patrols===
A seventh patrol beginning 4 June 1942, resulted in 32,985 GRT of shipping destroyed. The Brazilian ''Pedrinhas'' and the British ''Putney Hill'' were sent to the bottom on 26 June. Two days later the American [[Liberty Ship]] ''Sam Houston'' was torpedoed and then finished off with 43 rounds from the [[deck gun]]. The British ''Cape Verde'' was sunk on 9 July and the Panamanian tanker ''Stanvac Palembang'' on 11 July bringing the tally to five victories on this successful patrol.

The next 23 day sortie was unfruitful; however, the U-boat's commander, Rolf M<U+00FC>tzelburg, died during this patrol on 11 September. Taking the opportunity to go swimming in the Atlantic southwest of the [[Azores]], he dived from the conning tower and struck the deck with his head and shoulder when the U-boat lurched suddenly in the swell. The doctor from ''[[German submarine U-462|U-462]]'', a 'Milk Cow' supply submarine, arrived the next day, but too late. Rolf M<U+00FC>tzelburg was buried at sea on 12 September 1942 in position {{coord|36|14|N|31|21|W}}. He was replaced by ''Kptlt.'' Hermann Kottman, who served as captain for the remainder of ''U-203''{{'}}s career.

Her ninth patrol, beginning 15 October 1942 and terminating 6 November, yielded two further ships sunk. The British merchantmen ''Hopecastle'' and ''Corinaldo'' (5,178 and 7,131 GRT, respectively) were sunk on 29 October and 30 October while traveling with [[List of World War II convoys|Convoy SL-125]].

==Loss==
''U-203'' undertook two more patrols, both unsuccessful. On 25 April 1943 while south of [[Cape Farewell, Greenland|Cape Farewell]], [[Greenland]] she was sunk by depth charges in position {{coord|55|05|N|42|25|W}}. She had been attacked by [[Fairey Swordfish]] aircraft operating from the British escort carrier {{HMS|Biter|D97|6}} and the British destroyer {{HMS|Pathfinder}}. Ten men were killed, there were 38 survivors.

==Summary of raiding history==
''U-203'' sank 21 ships and damaged three others for a total of 111,322 GRT.
