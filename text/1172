==History==

The founder, [[Anders Sandvig]], collected from old houses and farmyards within the [[Gudbrandsdalen]] valley to provide a sample of Norwegian culture and history in a museum. He first started in his backyard, but when his collection grew, in 1901, the town council offered him a permanent site for the museum. In 1904, the city of Lillehammer set aside an area already known as Maihaugen and bought Sandvig's collection and established ''Sandvigske Samlinger'' (Sandvig Collections), the formal name for Maihaugen. Sandvig was at first hired as unpaid curator, but was later appointed the museum's first director. The new site of the museum had been used as a picnic and meeting place for the townspeople. People had met here to celebrate the [[Norwegian Constitution Day]] and to light bonfires for Midsummer eve.<ref>[http://www.visitnorway.com/en/Product/?pid=74947 ''Maihaugen Museum''(visitnorway)]</ref>

Maihaugen tells the history of how people have been living in the valley of Gudbrandsdalen from the Middle Ages until today. Social Institutions such as a church, school, post office, railway station, shops, prisons and military facilities are all represented at the museum. The museum has a rich collection of artifacts, furniture, tools and ornaments, ranging in age from the Middle Ages.<ref>[http://www.norway.com/directories/d_company.asp?id=239 ''Maihaugen Museums'' (Norgate Online AS)]</ref>

The [[Garmo stave church]] is one of the main attractions. In 1882, the church was disassembled and sold to Anders Sandvig, who brought it to Lillehammer, where it was re-erected at Maihaugen in 1920-1921.<ref>[http://www.stavkirke.org/stavkirker/garmo.html ''Garmo  church''  (stavkirke.org)]</ref>

Maihaugen also includes a large photography archive and an indoor museum. Constructed in 1959, they were extended in preparation for the Lillehammer [[1994 Winter Olympics]].  Maihaugsalen concert hall, with over 700 seats and a large exhibition space, was opened in September 1967.<ref>[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/lillehammer/A29292.html ''Lillehammer (Frommer's Norway, 3rd Edition)]</ref>
