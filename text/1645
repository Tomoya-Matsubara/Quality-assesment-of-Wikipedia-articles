'''IVB meteorites''' are a group of [[ataxite]] [[iron meteorite]]s classified as [[achondrites]].<ref name="Weisberg 2006">{{cite book|last=Binze|first=D.S. Lauretta, H.Y.

==Description==
The IVB meteorites are composed of [[meteoric iron]] ([[kamacite]], [[taenite]] and [[tetrataenite]]). The chemical composition is low in volatile elements and high in Nickel and refractory elements. Although IVB meteorites are [[ataxite]]s ("without structure"), they show microscopic [[widmanst<U+00E4>tten pattern]]s. The lamella are smaller than 20{{nbsp}}<U+00B5>m wide and lie in a matrix of [[plessite]].<ref name="Yang 2010">{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jijin|coauthors=Goldstein, Joseph I.; Michael, Joseph R.; Kotula, Paul G.; Scott, Edward R.D.|title=Thermal history and origin of the IVB iron meteorites and their parent body|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=31 July 2010|volume=74|issue=15|pages=4493<U+2013>4506|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2010.04.011}}</ref>

==Parent body==
IVB meteorites formed the core of a parent body that was later destroyed, some of the fragments falling on earth as meteorites.<ref name="Yang 2010" /> Models about the IVB parent body have to take into account the extreme chemical composition, especially the depletion of volatile elements (Gallium, Germanium) and the enrichment in refractory elements (Iridium) compared to other [[iron meteorite]]s.<ref name="Campbell 2005" />

The history of the parent body has been worked out in detail. The IVB parent body formed from material that condensed at the highest temperatures while the solar nebula cooled off. The enrichment in refractory elements was caused by less than 10{{nbsp}}% of the condensible material going into the parent body.<ref name="Campbell 2005" /> The high Nickel concentrations were caused by oxidizing physical conditions. The chemical variation of IVB specimen can be explained as different stages of the fractional crystallization of the convecting core of the parent body.<ref name="Yang 2010" /> The exact size of the parent body is still debated. Modelling of cooling rates suggest that it had a 140 <U+00B1> 30 km radius with a 70 <U+00B1> 15 km radius core. The fast cooling rates are explained by a graze-shot-collision of the parent body with a larger asteroid. This removed the mantle from the parent body, leaving the shattered iron core behind to rapidly cool.<ref name="Yang 2010" />

==Notable specimen==
As of December 2012, 14 specimen of IVB meteorites are known.<ref name="Meteoritical Bulletin Database">{{cite web|title=Meteoritical Bulletin Database|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/metbull.php|publisher=Meteoritical Society|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> A notable specimen is the [[Hoba meteorite]], the largest known meteorite.
