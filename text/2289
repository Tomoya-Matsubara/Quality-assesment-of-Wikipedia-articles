== Ruskin ==
The School can trace its origins to 1871 when [[John Ruskin]] founded a drawing school in the University Galleries (subsequently the [[Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology]]) to encourage artisanship and technical skills. The Ruskin remained at the Ashmolean until 1974 when it moved to 74 [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]]. It also occupies a further building at 128 Bullingdon Road.

The School was originally called the Ruskin School of Drawing. Fine Art was added as a discrete focus in 1945.

The [[Slade School of Fine Art]] relocated to the Ruskin for the duration of the [[Second World War]].
