'''Hyperkinesia''' (and also '''hyperkinesis''') refers to an increase in muscular activity that can result in excessive abnormal movements, excessive normal movements, or a combination of both.<ref name=hyperkinesia>{{cite book|last=Anthoney|first=Terence|title=Neuroanatomy and the Neurologic Exam:  A Thesaurus of Synonyms, Similar-Sounding Non-Synonyms, and Terms of Variable Meaning|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press LLC|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=0-8493-8631-4|pages=293-294|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=whrU2XEvGFIC&pg=PA293&dq=hyperkinesia&hl=en&ei=vCuiTfQF5bXRAcWmwIEF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=hyperkinesia&f=false}}</ref> The word hyperkinesis comes from the Greek ''hyper'', meaning increased, and ''kinein'', meaning to move. Hyperkinesia is a state of excessive restlessness which incorporates a large variety of disorders that affect the ability to control motor movement such as [[Huntington<U+2019>s disease]]. It is the opposite of [[hypokinesia]], which refers to decreased bodily movement, as commonly manifested in [[Parkinson's disease]]. Often, hyperkinesia is paired with [[hypotonia]], a decrease in muscle tone.<ref name=fundamentals>{{cite book|last=Mumenthaler|first=Marco|title=Fundamentals of Neurology: An Illustrated Guide|year=2006|publisher=Georg Thieme Verlag|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58890-450-4|pages=75, 132-135|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ktEPPiLeiWoC&pg=PA131&dq=hyperkinesia&hl=en&ei=Z0CiTfK8E-fp0gGZzrigBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=hyperkinesia&f=false}}</ref> Many hyperkinetic disorders are psychological in nature and are typically prominent in childhood.<ref name=HM />

==Signs and symptoms==

There are various terms which refer to specific movement mechanisms which contribute to the differential diagnoses of hyperkinetic disorders.  

As defined by Hogan and Sternad, <U+201C>posture<U+201D> is a nonzero time period during which bodily movement is minimal. When a movement is called <U+201C>discrete,<U+201D> it means that a new posture is assumed without any other postures interrupting the process. <U+201C>Rhythmic<U+201D> movements are those that occur in cycles of similar movements. <U+201C>Repetitive,<U+201D> <U+201C>recurrent,<U+201D> and <U+201C>reciprocal<U+201D> movements feature a certain bodily or joint position that occur more than once in a period, but not necessarily in a cyclic manner.<ref name=childhood /> 

Overflow refers to unwanted movements which occur during a desired movement. It may occur in situations which the individual<U+2019>s motor intention spreads to either nearby or distant muscles, taking away from the original goal of the movement.  Co-contraction refers to a voluntary movement performed to suppress the involuntary movement, such as forcing one<U+2019>s wrist toward the body to stop it from involuntarily moving away from the body.<ref name=childhood /> 

In evaluating these signs and symptoms, one must consider the frequency of repetition, whether or not the movements can be suppressed voluntarily (either by cognitive decisions, restraint, or sensory tricks), the awareness of the affected individual during the movement events, any urges to make the movements, and if the affected individual feels rewarded after having completed the movement. The context of the movement should also be noted; this means that a movement could be triggered in a certain posture, while at rest, during action, or during a specific task. The movement<U+2019>s quality can also be described in observing whether or not the movement can be categorized as a normal movement by an unaffected individual, or one that is not normally made on a daily basis by unaffected individuals.<ref name=childhood />

==Diagnosis==

Basic hyperkinetic movements can be defined as any unwanted, excess movement.<ref name=HM>{{cite journal|last=Sanger|first=Terence D.|coauthors=Daofen Chen, Darcy L. Fehlings, Mark Hallett, Anthony E. Lang, and Johnathan W. Mink|title=Definition and Classification of Hyperkinetic Movements in Childhood|journal=Movement Disorders|date=11 Nov. 2010|volume=25|pages=1538-1549|accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref> Such abnormal movements can be distinguished from each other on the basis of whether or not, or to what degree they are, rhythmic, discrete, repeated, and random. In evaluating the individual with a suspected form of hyperkinesia, the physician will record a thorough medical history including a clear description of the movements in question, medications prescribed in the past and present, family history of similar diseases, medical history including past infections, and any past exposure to toxic chemicals.<ref name=legal>{{cite book|last=Wishik|first=Jeffrey|title=Medical and Legal Aspects of Neurology|year=2005|publisher=Lawyers and Judges Publishing Co., Inc.|location=Tuscon, AZ|isbn=1-930056-30-3|pages=306-310|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zIbFGayrlUgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=hyperkinetic&f=false}}</ref> Hyperkinesia is a defining feature of many childhood movement disorders. Several forms of hyperkinetic movements include:

===Ataxia===

The term [[ataxia]] refers to a group of progressive neurological diseases that affect coordination and balance. Ataxias are often characterized by poor coordination of hands and eye movements, speech problems and a wide-based and unsteady gait. Ataxia can result from stroke, tumor, infection, trauma or degenerative changes in the cerebellum. They are generally classified into two groups: hereditary and sporadic ataxias. Hereditary ataxias affect the cerebellum and spinal cord and are passed from one generation to the next through a defective gene. A common hereditary ataxia is Friedreich's (recessive) ataxia. Sporadic ataxias occur spontaneously in individuals with no known family history of ataxia.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Athetosis===

[[Athetosis]] is defined as a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture. These are continuously smooth, nonrhythmic movements. They mainly involve the distal extremities, but can also involve the face, neck, and trunk.<ref name=HM />

===Chorea===

[[Chorea]] is an ongoing, random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. These movements can involve the face, trunk, neck, tongue, and extremities. Unlike dystonic movements, chorea-associated movements are often more rapid, random and unpredictable. Movements are repeated, but not rhythmic in nature. Children with chorea appear fidgety and will often try to hide the random movements by voluntarily turning the involuntary, abnormal movement into a seemingly more normal, purposeful motion.<ref name=HM />

===Dystonia===

[[Dystonia]] is defined as a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting or repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Such abnormal postures include foot inversion, wrist ulnar deviation, or lordotic trunk twisting<ref name=HM />. They can be localized to specific parts of the body or be generalized to many different muscle groups. These postures are often sustained for long periods of time and can be combined in time. Dystonic movements can augment hyperkinetic movements, especially when linked to voluntary movements.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Blepharospasm]] is a type of dystonia marked by involuntary contraction of the eyelid muscles. Symptoms may range from intermittent, increased frequency of blinking to constant, painful eye closure leading to functional blindness.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Oromandibular dystonia]] is a type of distonia characterized by forceful contractions of the lower face causing the mouth to open or close. Chewing and unusual tongue movements may also occur.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Laryngeal dystonia]] or [[spasmodic dysphonia]] is a type of dystonia due to abnormal contraction of muscles in the voice box producing changes in the voice. Patients may have a strained-strangled quality to their voice or in some cases a whispering/breathy quality.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Cervical dystonia]] (CD) or [[spasmodic torticollis]] is marked by muscle spasms of the head and neck may be painful and cause the neck to twist into unusual positions or postures.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Writer's cramp]] and musician<U+2019>s cramp is a task-specific dystonia, meaning that it only occurs when performing certain tasks. Writer<U+2019>s cramp is a contraction of hand and/or arm muscles that happens only when a patient is writing. It does not occur in other situations, such as when a patient is typing or eating. Musician<U+2019>s cramp occurs only when a musician plays his/her instrument. For example, pianists may experience cramping of their hands when playing, while brass players may have cramping or contractions of their mouth muscles.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Hemiballismus===

Typically caused by damage to the subthalamic nucleus or nuclei, [[hemiballismus]] movements are nonrhythmic, rapid, nonsuppressible, and violent. They usually occur in an isolated body part, such as the proximal arm.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web|last=Eidelberg|first=David|title=Movement and Cerebellar Disorders|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/sec16/ch221/ch221a.html|work=Neurologic Disorders|publisher=Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Hemifacial spasm===

[[Hemifacial spasm]] (HFS) is characterized by involuntary contraction of facial muscles. HFS usually occurs only on one side of the face. Like blepharospasm, the frequency of contractions in hemifacial spasm may range from intermittent to frequent and constant. The unilateral blepharospasm of HFS may be particularly troublesome, interfering with routine tasks such as driving. In addition to medication, patients may respond well to treatment with [[Botox]]. HFS may be due to vascular compression of the nerves going to the muscles of the face. For these patients, surgical decompression may result in long-lasting improvement of symptoms.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Myoclonus===

[[Myoclonus]] is defined as a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. These movements may be asynchronous, in which several muscles contract variably in time, synchronous, in which muscles contract simultaneously, or spreading, in which several muscles contract sequentially. It is characterized by a sudden, unidirectional movement due to muscle contraction, followed by a relaxation period in which the muscle is no longer contracted. However, when this relaxation phase is decreased, as when muscle contractions become faster, a mytoclonic tremor results.<ref name=HM />

===Stereotypies===

[[Stereotypies]] are repetitive, rhythmic, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. Like tremors, they are typically back and forth movements, and most commonly occur bilaterally. They often involve fingers, wrists, or proximal portions of the upper extremities. Although, like tics, they can stem from stress and excitement, there is no underlying urge to move associated with stereotypies and these movements can be stopped with distraction. When aware of the movements, the child can also suppress them voluntarily.<ref name=HM /> Stereotypies are quite common in preschool-aged children and for this reason are not necessarily indicative of neurological pathology on their own.<ref name=childhood />

===Tardive dyskinesia / tardive dystonia===

[[Tardive dyskinesia]] or ''tardive dystonia'', both referred to as "TD," refers to a wide variety of involuntary sterotypical movements caused by the prolonged use of dopamine receptor-blocking agents. The most common dopamine receptor-blocking agents are antipsychotics and anti-nausea agents. The classic form of TD refers to stereotypic movements of the mouth, where patients look like they are chewing gum. However, TD can take the form of other involuntary movements such as [[chorea]], [[dystonia]] or [[tics]].<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Tics===

A [[tic]] can be defined as a repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. These movements are predictable, often triggered by stress, excitement, suggestion, or brief voluntary suppressibility. Many children say that the onset of tics can stem from the strong urge to move. Tics can be either muscular (alter normal motor function) or vocal (alter normal speech) in nature and most commonly involve the face, mouth, eyes, head, neck or shoulder muscles.<ref name=HM /> 

When both motor and vocal tics are present and persist for more than one year, a diagnosis of [[Tourette syndrome]] (TS) is likely. TS is an inherited neurobehavioral disorder characterized by both motor and vocal tics. Many individuals with TS also may develop obsessions, compulsions, inattention and hyperactivity. TS begins in childhood.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Up to 5% of the population suffers from tics, but at least 20% of boys will have developed tics at some point in their lifetimes.<ref name=childhood />

===Tremor===

A [[tremor]] can be defined as a rhythmic, back and forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tremors are symmetric about a midpoint within the movement, and both portions of the movement occur at the same speed. Unlike the other hyperkinetic movements, tremors lack both the jerking associated movements and posturing.<ref name=HM /> 

[[Essential tremor]] (ET), also known as ''benign essential tremor'', or familial tremor, is the most common movement disorder. It is estimated that 5 percent of people worldwide have this condition. It can affect people of any age and tends to run in families. ET is a tremor that usually affects the hands and arms but can also affect the head, voice, chin, trunk and legs. Both sides of the body tend to be equally affected. The tremor is called an action tremor, meaning that the tremor typically becomes noticeable in the arms when they are being used. Patients often report that the tremor in ET improves significantly with alcohol. First-line medical treatments for ET are [[beta-blockers]]. For patients in otherwise good health who fail to respond adequately to medication, [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[thalamotomy]] can be highly effective.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Volitional hyperkinesia===

Volitional hyperkinesia refers to any type of involuntary movement described above that interrupts an intended voluntary muscular movement.  These movements tend to be jolts that present suddenly during an otherwise smoothly coordinated action of skeletal muscle.<ref name=children>{{cite book|last=Fernandez-Alvarez|first=Emilio|title=Movement Disorders in Children|year=2001|publisher=Mac Keith Press|location=London WC1V 6RL, England|isbn=1-898-68323-9|pages=232|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j1FsFT45vP8C&pg=PA232&dq=%22volitional+hyperkinesia%22&hl=en&ei=IxeaTfDvF-O90QGV8Lj2Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22volitional%20hyperkinesia%22&f=false}}</ref>

==Causes==
[[File:Brain structure.gif|thumb|Brain structure|The basal ganglia are located in the midbrain.]]
The causes of the majority of the above hyperkinetic movements can be traced to improper modulation of the [[basal ganglia]] by the subthalamic nucleus. In many cases, the excitatory output of the subthalamic nucleus is reduced, leading to a reduced inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia. Without the normal restraining influence of the basal ganglia, upper motor neurons of the circuit tend to become more readily activated by inappropriate signals, resulting in the characteristic abnormal movements.<ref name=NeuroBook>{{cite book|last=Purves|first=Dale|title=Neuroscience|year=2008|publisher=Sinaeur Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, MA|pages=468-469}}</ref> Hyperkinesia occurs when dopamine receptors, and norepinephrine receptors to a lesser extent, within the cortex and the brainstem are more sensitive to dopamine or when the dopaminergic receptors/neurons are hyperactive. Hyperkinesia can be caused by a large number of different diseases including metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, heritable disorders, vascular disorders, or traumatic disorders. Other causes include toxins within the brain, autoimmune diseases, and infections, which include meningitis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical and molecular characterisation of hereditary dopamine transporter deficiency syndrome: an observational cohort and experimental study.|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X3F-51JM46N-2&_user=521319&_coverDate=01%2F31%2F2011&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000026018&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=521319&md5=9fc1f843fa7edbdda8728f5965e0c920&searchtype=a|work=The Lancet Neurology|accessdate=3 March 2011|author=Manju A. Kurian, et al|pages=54-62|month=January|year=2011}}</ref>

Since the basal ganglia often have many connections with the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain, hyperkinesia can be associated with neurobehavioral or neuropsychiatric disorders such as mood changes, [[psychosis]], anxiety, disinhibition, cognitive impairments, and inappropriate behavior.<ref name=legal />

In children, primary dystonia is usually inherited genetically. Secondary dystonia, however, is most commonly caused by dyskinetic [[cerebral palsy]], due to [[hypoxic]] or [[ischemic]] injury to the basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus during the prenatal or infantile stages of development. Chorea and ballism can be caused by damage to the [[subthalamic nucleus]]. Chorea can be secondary to [[hyperthyroidism]]. Athetosis can be secondary to sensory loss in the distal limbs; this is called ''pseudoathetosis'' in adults but is not yet proven in children.<ref name=childhood>{{cite journal|last=Sanger|first=Terence|coauthors=et al.|title=Definition and Classification of Hyperkinetic Movements in Childhood|journal=Movement Disorders|date=29|year=2010|month=June|volume=25|issue=11|pages=1538-1549|doi=10.1002/mds.23088|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.bc.edu/doi/10.1002/mds.23088/full|accessdate=4 April 2011}}</ref>

==Diseases presenting with hyperkinesia==

Diseases that feature one or more hyperkinetic movements as prominent symptoms include: 

* Huntington's disease
* Wilson's disease
* Restless leg syndrome 

===Huntington's disease===

Hyperkinesia is the hallmark symptom of [[Huntington<U+2019>s disease]], formerly referred to as ''Huntington<U+2019>s chorea''. Appropriately, chorea is derived from the Greek word, ''khoros'', meaning <U+201C>dance.<U+201D> The extent of the hyperkinesia exhibited in the disease can vary from solely the little finger to the entire body, resembling purposeful movements but occurring involuntarily. In children, rigidity and seizures are also symptoms.<ref name=NeuroBook />
Other hyperkinetic symptoms include:

* Head turning to shift eye position
* Facial movements, including grimaces
* Slow, uncontrolled movements
* Quick, sudden, sometimes wild jerking movements of the arms, legs, face, and other body parts
* Unsteady gait 
* Abnormal reflexes
* <U+201C>prancing,<U+201D> or a wide walk<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dugdale|first=David C.|coauthors=Daniel B. Hoch|title=Huntington's disease|journal=PubMed Health|date=24 June 2009|year=2011|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001775/|accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>  

The disease is characterized further by the gradual onset of defects in behavior and cognition, including dementia and speech impediments, beginning in the fourth or fifth decades of life. It is a progressive disorder, leading to death within 10-20 years. It is caused by the [[Huntingtin]] gene, which is a mutation that causes unstable triple repeats, which code for the amino acid [[glutamine]]. Typically, this CAG sequence is repeated 10-35 times in normal cells, but, with Huntington<U+2019>s, between 36 and 120 repeats found. Proteins with longer stretches of glutamine are associated with patients whose symptoms begin at a younger age, implying that the disease is in fact attributable to this mutated portion of the protein. This mutation eventually contributes to selective atrophy of the [[Caudate nucleus]] and [[Putamen]], especially of [[GABAergic]] and acetylcholinergic neurons, with some additional degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices of the brain. There is no known cure for Huntington<U+2019>s Disease, yet there is treatment available to minimize the hyperkinetic movements. Dopamine blockers, such as [[haloperidol]], [[tetrabenazine]], and [[amantidine]], are often effective in this regard.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Physiology of Behavior|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=Boston, MA|pages=537-538}}</ref>

===Wilson's disease===
[[File:Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson.jpg|thumb|[[Samuel Alexander Kinnier Wilson]], the neurologist most known for his description of what came to be known as [[Wilson's disease]].]]

[[Wilson<U+2019>s disease]] (WD) is a rare inherited disorder in which patients have a problem with copper metabolism. In patients with WD, copper accumulates in the liver and then in other parts of the body, particularly the brain, eyes and kidneys. When the copper starts to accumulate in the brain, patients may experience [[tremor]], speech problems, incoordination, dystonia gait difficulties and swallowing problems. Psychiatric disturbances such as irritability, impulsiveness, aggressiveness and mood disturbances are also common. UMHS has a research protocol for patients with [[Wilson<U+2019>s disease]].<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Restless leg syndrome===

[[Restless leg syndrome]] is a disorder where patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations occur usually in the evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down and relaxing. Patients feel like they have to move their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, this can lead to [[insomnia]] and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age.<ref name=UMHS>{{cite web|title=Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/md/patient/conditions-hyper.htm|work=Movement Disorders Program|publisher=Regents of the University of Michigan|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>

===Post-stroke repercussions===

A multitude of movement disorders have been observed after either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.  Some examples include athetosis, chorea with or without hemiballismus, tremor, dystonia, and segmental or focal myoclonus, although the prevalence of these manifestations after stroke is quite low.  The amount of time that passes between stroke event and presentation of hyperkinesia depends on the type of hyperkinetic movement since their pathologies slightly differ.  Chorea tends to affect older stroke victims while dystonia tends to affect younger ones.  Men and women have an equal chance of developing the hyperkinetic movements after stroke.  Strokes causing small, deep lesions in the basal ganglia, brain stem and thalamus are those most likely to be associated with post-stroke hyperkinesia.<ref name=MDAS />

==Treatment==
===Medical therapy===

''Athetosis, chorea and hemiballismus''

Before prescribing medication for these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations have pointed to improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses.  Pharmacological treatments include the typical [[neuroleptic]] agents such as [[fluphenazine]], [[pimozide]], [[haloperidol]] and [[perphenazine]] which block dopamine receptors; these are the first line of treatment for hemiballismus.  [[Quetiapine]], [[sulpiride]] and [[olanzapine]], the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced [[parkinsonism]] and tardive dyskinesia.  Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism.  Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases.<ref name=MDAS />

''Essential tremor''

The medical treatment of essential tremor at the Movement Disorders Clinic at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] begins with minimizing stress and tremorgenic drugs along with recommending a restricted intake of beverages containing [[caffeine]] as a precaution, although caffeine has not been shown to significantly intensify the presentation of essential tremor.  [[Alcohol]] amounting to a blood concentration of only 0.3% has been shown to reduce the amplitude of essential tremor in two-thirds of patients; for this reason it may be used as a prophylactic treatment before events during which one would be embarrassed by the tremor presenting itself.  Using alcohol regularly and/or in excess to treat tremors is highly unadvisable, as there is a purported correlation between tremor and alcoholism.  Alcohol is thought to stabilize neuronal membranes via potentiation of [[GABA receptor]]-mediated chloride influx.  It has been demonstrated in essential tremor animal models that the food additive 1-[[octanol]] suppresses tremors induced by [[harmaline]], and decreases the amplitude of essential tremor for about 90 minutes.<ref name=Joseph />

Two of the most valuable drug treatments for essential tremor are [[propranolol]], a [[beta blocker]], and [[primidone]], an [[anticonvulsant]].  Propranolol is much more effective for hand tremor than head and voice tremor.  Beta-adrenergic blockers (beta blockers) are not lipid soluble and therefore cannot cross the [[blood-brain barrier]], but can still act against tremors; this indicates that this drug<U+2019>s mechanism of therapy may be influenced by peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors.  Primidone<U+2019>s mechanism of tremor prevention has been shown significantly in controlled clinical studies.  The [[benzodiazepine]] drugs such as [[diazepam]] and [[barbiturates]] have been shown to reduce presentation of several types of tremor, including the essential variety.  Controlled clinical trials of [[gabapentin]] yielded mixed results in efficacy against essential tremor  while [[topiramate]] was shown to be effective in a larger double-blind controlled study, resulting in both lower Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor scale ratings and better function and disability as compared to placebo.<ref name=Joseph />

''Dystonia''

Treatment of primary dystonia is aimed at reducing symptoms such as involuntary movements, pain, contracture, embarrassment, and to restore normal posture and improve the patient<U+2019>s function.  This treatment is therefore not [[neuroprotective]].  According to the European Federation of Neurological Sciences and Movement Disorder Society, there is no evidence-based recommendation for treating primary dystonia with [[antidopaminergic]] or [[anticholinergic]] drugs although recommendations have been based on empirical evidence.   Anticholinergic drugs prove to be most effective in treating generalized and segmental dystonia, especially if dose starts out low and increases gradually.  Generalized dystonia has also been treated with such [[muscle relaxants]] as the benzodiazepines.  Another muscle relaxant, [[baclofen]], can help reduce [[spasticity]] seen in [[cerebral palsy]] such as dystonia in the leg and trunk.  Treatment of secondary dystonia by administering levodopa in [[dopamine-responsive dystonia]], copper [[chelation]] in Wilson<U+2019>s disease, or stopping the administration of drugs that may induce dystonia have been proven effective in a small number of cases.  Physical therapy has been used to improve posture and prevent contractures via braces and casting, although in some cases, immobilization of limbs can induce dystonia, which is by definition known as peripherally induced dystonia.  There are not many clinical trials that show significant efficacy for particular drugs, so medical of dystonia must be planned on a case-by-case basis.<ref name=Joseph />

''Tics''

Treatment of tics present in conditions such as Tourette<U+2019>s syndrome begins with patient, relative, teacher and peer education about the presentation of the tics.  Sometimes, pharmacological treatment is unnecessary and tics can be reduced by behavioral therapy such as habit-reversal therapy and/or counseling.  Often this route of treatment is difficult because it depends most heavily on patient compliance.  Once pharmacological treatment is deemed most appropriate, lowest effective doses should be given first with gradual increases.  The most effective drugs belong to the neuroleptic variety such as monoamine-depleting drugs and dopamine receptor-blocking drugs.  Of the monoamine-depleting drugs, tetrabenazine is most powerful against tics and results in fewest side effects.  A non-neuroleptic drug found to be safe and effective in treating tics is topiramate.<ref name=Joseph />

===Botulinum toxin therapy===

''Essential tremor''

It has been shown in two double-blind controlled studies that injection of [[botulinum toxin]] into muscles used to produce oscillatory movements of essential tremors, such as forearm, wrist and finger flexors, may decrease the amplitude of hand tremor for approximately three months  and that injections of the toxin may reduce essential tremor presenting in the head and voice.  The toxin also may help tremor causing difficulty in writing, although properly adapted writing devices may be more efficient.  Due to high incidence of side effects, use of botulinum toxin has only received a C level of support from the scientific community.<ref name=Joseph />

''Dystonia''

Botulinum toxin B, or [[Myobloc]], has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat cervical dystonia due to level A evidential support by the scientific community.<ref name=Joseph />

''Tics''

Botulinum toxin injection in affected muscles can successfully treat tics; involuntary movements and vocalizations can be reduced, as well as life-threatening tics that have the potential of causing compressive [[myelopathy]] or [[radiculopathy]].<ref name=Joseph />

===Surgical therapy===

''Athetosis, chorea and hemiballismus''

[[Stereotactic]] ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a [[thalamic stimulator]] have been shown to be effective in treating these conditions.<ref name=MDAS />

''Essential tremor''

[[Deep brain stimulation]] toward the [[ventral]] intermediate nucleus of the [[thalamus]] and potentially the [[subthalamic nucleus]] and [[caudal]] [[zona incerta]] nucleus have been shown to reduce tremor in numerous studies.  That toward the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus has been shown to reduce [[contralateral]] and some [[ipsilateral]] tremor along with tremors of the cerebellar outflow, head, resting state and those related to hand tasks; however, the treatment has been shown to induce difficulty articulating thoughts ([[dysarthria]]), and loss of coordination and balance in long-term studies.  Motor cortex stimulation is another option shown to be viable in numerous clinical trials.<ref name=MDAS>{{cite journal|last=Handley|first=Alexandra|coauthors=Medcalf, Pippa; Hellier, Kate; Dutta, Dipankar|title=Movement disorders after stroke|journal=Age and Ageing|date=10 March 2009|year=2009|month=March|volume=38|issue=3|pages=260-266|doi=10.1093/ageing/afp020|url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org.proxy.bc.edu/content/38/3/260.full#content-block|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref> 

''Dystonia''

Surgery known as GPi DBS (Globus Pallidus Pars Interna Deep Brain Stimulation) has come to be popular in treating phasic forms of dystonia, although cases involving posturing and tonic contractions have improved to a lesser extent with this surgery.  A follow-up study has found that movement score improvements observed one year after the surgery was maintained after three years in 58% of the cases.  It has also been proven effective in treating cervical and cranial-cervical dystonia.<ref name=Joseph />

''Tics''

Surgical treatment for disabling Tourette<U+2019>s syndrome has been proven effective in cases presenting with self-injury.  Deep Brain Stimulation surgery targeting the globus pallidus, thalamus and other areas of the brain may be effective in treating involuntary and possibly life-threatening tics.<ref name=Joseph>{{cite journal|last=Jankovic|first=Joseph|title=Treatment of hyperkinetic movement disorders|journal=The Lancet Neurology|date=10 August 2009|year=2009|month=August|volume=8|issue=9|pages=844-856|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70183-8|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.bc.edu/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6X3F-4WYSK74-G&_user=521319&_coverDate=09%2F30%2F2009&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=gateway&_origin=gateway&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_acct=C000026018&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=521319&md5=acd10e76f1a36762e03d5018742619d9&searchtype=a#secx8|accessdate=21 March 2011}}</ref>

==History==

In the 16th century, [[Andreas Vesalius]] and [[Francesco Piccolomini]] were the first to distinguish between white matter, the cortex, and the subcortical nuclei in the brain. About a century later, [[Thomas Willis]] noticed that the [[corpus striatum]] was typically discolored, shrinkened, and abnormally softened in the cadavers of people who had died from paralysis. The view that the corpus striatum played such a large role in motor functions was the most prominent one until the 1800s when electrophysiologic stimulation studies began to be performed. For example, [[Gustav Fritsch]] and [[Eduard Hitzig]] performed them on dog cerebral cortices in 1870, while [[David Ferrier]] performed them, along with ablation studies, on cerebral cortices of dogs, rabbits, cats, and primates in 1876. During the same year, [[John Hughlings Jackson]] posited that the motor cortex was more relevant to motor function than the corpus striatum after carrying out clinical-pathologic experiments in humans. Soon it would be discovered that the theory about the corpus striatum would not be completely incorrect.<ref name=history>{{cite book|last=Lanska|first=Douglas|title=History of Neurology|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|location=New York|pages=501-502|url=https://illiad2.bc.edu/illiad/BXM/illiad.dll?SessionID=F150218026D&Action=10&Form=75&Value=367531}}</ref> 

By the late 1800s, a few hyperkinesias such as Huntington<U+2019>s chorea, post-[[hemiplegic]] choreoathetosis, Tourette<U+2019>s syndrome, and some forms of both tremor and dystonia were described in a clinical orientation.  However, the common pathology was still a mystery.  British neurologist [[William Richard Gowers]] called these disorders <U+201C>general and functional diseases of the nervous system<U+201D> in his 1888 publication entitled ''A Manual of Diseases of the Nervous System''. It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that sufficient animal models and human clinical trials were utilized to discover the specific involvement of the basal ganglia in the hyperkinesia pathology. In 1998, Wichmann and Delong made the conclusion that hyperkinesia is associated with decreased output from the basal ganglia, and in contrast, hypokinesia is associated with increased output from the basal ganglia. This generalization, however, still leaves a need for more complex models to distinguish the more nuanced pathologies of the numerous diverse hyperkinesias which are still being studied today.<ref name=history />

==Research Directions==
[[File:Electromyogram.png|thumb|A healthy, neuropathic, and myopathic electromyogram, respectively.]]

Studies have been done with [[electromyography]] to trace skeletal muscle activity in some hyperkinetic disorders. The electromyogram (EMG) of dystonia sometimes shows rapid rhythmic bursts, but these patterns can almost always be produced intentionally. In the myoclonus EMG, there are typically brief, and sometimes rhythmic, bursts or pauses in the recording pattern. When the bursts last for 50 milliseconds or less they are indicative of cortical myoclonus, but when they last up to 200 milliseconds, they are indicative of spinal or brainstem myoclonus. Such bursts can occur in multiple muscles simultaneously quite quickly, but high time resolution must be used in the EMG trace to clearly record them. The bursts recorded for tremor tend to be longer in duration than those of myoclonus, although some types can last for durations within the range for those of myoclonus. Future studies would have to examine the EMGs for tics, athetosis, stereotypies and chorea as there are minimal recordings done for those movements. However, it may be predicted that the EMG for chorea would include bursts varying in duration, timing, and amplitude, while that for tics and stereotypies would take on patterns of voluntary movements.<ref name=childhood />
