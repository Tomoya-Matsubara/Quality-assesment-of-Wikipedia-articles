'''Joseph Staten''' is a bestselling [[United States|American]] [[writer]] born in [[San Francisco, California]]. The son of a [[Theology|theologian]], Staten originally planned on becoming an actor, but dropped the idea in college. He instead pursued a number of jobs before becoming a staff member at game developer [[Bungie]] in 1998 after meeting some of the developers in online ''[[Myth (computer game series)|Myth]]'' matches.

At Bungie, Staten served as director of cinematics for the studio's games, including the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series; he would write mission scripts and movie dialogue for the titles. He has also been involved in managing the expansion of the ''Halo'' franchise to other game studios and producers, including [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[Wingnut Interactive]]. Though not a published author previously, [[Tor Books]] approached Staten to write the fifth ''Halo'' novelization, ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]''. Released in 2007, the novel reached #3 on ''[[The New York Times]]'' bestseller list in the first week of its release and received positive reviews. Staten's current projects include work on the ''[[Halo 3]]'' expansion, ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]''.

"You need to be efficient and clever to give players the story<U+2014>the context<U+2014>they need. But you don't want to push too hard or they'll reject it." During his work on the games he read science fiction works by [[Iain Banks]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Vernor Vinge]].<ref name="G4feed" /> In addition to his writing contributions, Staten lends his voice to small aliens known as [[Covenant (Halo)#Races|Grunts]] in all three video games.<ref name="northw" />

Though previous ''Halo'' novels had been written by professional writers like [[Eric Nylund]] and [[William C.
