'''Philip Anthony Charnock''' (born 14 February 1975 in [[Southport]]) is an [[English people|English]] former [[Association football|footballer]].

==Playing career==
Charnock began his career with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and made his debut in [[1992<U+2013>93 in English football|1992]] in a [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] game against [[Apollon Limassol]]. Charnock was just 17 years and 9 months old, which made him the youngest player ever to play for the club in European competition, breaking a record previously set by [[Jamie Redknapp]] one year earlier. Despite this promising start, Charnock did not break into the first team at [[Anfield]], instead he spent much of his time in the [[Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserves]] and never appeared for the first time team again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/player_articles_view.asp?article_id=379&player_id=279|title= Charnock eyes the big time!|work=lfchistory.net|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref> With the advent of squad numbers in the [[Premier League]] from the [[1993<U+2013>94 in English football|1993<U+2013>94 season]] onwards, Charnock was issued with the number 18 shirt <U+2013> next worn by [[Michael Owen]], who went on to be one of the club's most highly regarded players ever.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/clubbyclub-guide-the-prospects-the-players-to-watch-the-arrivals-and-departures-1596119.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ian | last=Ridley | title=Club-by-club guide: The prospects, the players to watch, the arrivals and departures | date=13 August 1995}}</ref>
