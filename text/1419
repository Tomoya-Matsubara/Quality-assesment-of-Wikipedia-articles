This is a list of the '''[[island]]s of [[Scotland]]''', the mainland of which is part of the island of [[Great Britain]]. Also included are various other related tables and lists. The definition of an offshore island used in this list is that it is 'land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways'.<ref>Various other definitions are used. For example the General Register Office for Scotland define an island as 'a mass of land surrounded by water, separate from the Scottish mainland' but although they include islands linked by bridges etc. this is not clear from this definition. Haswell-Smith (2004) ''op cit'' uses 'an Island is a piece of land or group of pieces of land which is entirely surrounded by water at Lowest Astronomical Tide and to which there is no permanent means of dry access'. This is widely agreed to be unhelpful as it consciously excludes bridged islands. However, the large numbers of small tidal islets essentially defy categorisation.</ref>

Scotland has over 790 offshore islands, most of which are to be found in four main groups: [[Shetland Islands|Shetland]], [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]], and the [[Hebrides]], sub-divided into the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]].<ref name=Smith>{{cite book| author=Haswell-Smith, Hamish| date=2004| title=The Scottish Islands'| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Canongate| isbn=1-84195-454-3}}</ref> There are also clusters of islands in the [[Firth of Clyde]], [[Firth of Forth]], and [[Solway Firth]], and numerous small islands within the many bodies of [[freshwater]] in Scotland including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Maree]]. 

Many of these islands are swept by strong tides, and the [[Gulf of Corryvreckan|Corryvreckan tide race]] between [[Scarba]] and [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] is one of the largest whirlpools in the world. Other strong tides are to be found in the [[Pentland Firth]] between mainland Scotland and [[Orkney]], and the ''Grey Dog'' between Scarba and [[Lunga, Firth of Lorn|Lunga]].<ref name=Smith/>
The geology and geomorphology of the islands is very varied. Some such as [[Skye]] and [[Mull]] are mountainous whilst others like [[Tiree]] and [[Sanday, Orkney|Sanday]] are relatively low lying. Many have bedrock made from ancient [[Archaen]] Lewisian [[Gneiss]] which was originally laid down 3 billion years ago, [[Shapinsay]] and other Orkney islands are formed from [[Old Red Sandstone]], which is 400 million years old, and others such as [[R<U+00F9>m]] from more recent [[Tertiary]] [[volcanoes]]<ref>McKirdy, Alan Gordon, John & Crofts, Roger (2007) ''Land of Mountain and Flood: The Geology and Landforms of Scotland''. Edinburgh. Birlinn.</ref>

The largest island is [[Lewis with Harris]] which extends to 2,179&nbsp;[[square kilometres]], and there are a further 200 islands which are greater than 40&nbsp;[[hectares]] in area. Of the remainder, several such as [[Staffa]] and the [[Flannan Isles]] have achieved considerable notability despite their small size.<ref name=Smith/>

Some 97 Scottish islands are populated, of which 92 are offshore islands. Many previously inhabited islands such as [[Mingulay]], [[Noss]] and the [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] archipelago have been abandoned during the course of the past century and today only 14 islands are populated by over 1,000 people and 45 by over 100. Between 1991 and 2001, the population of the islands fell by 3 per cent overall, although there were 35 islands whose population increased. The total population of all the islands in 2001 was 99,739.<ref name=GRO>{{cite paper| url=http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/occpapers/occasional-paper-10.html| title=Occasional Paper No 10: Statistics for Inhabited Islands| author=General Register Office for Scotland| date=28 Nov 2003| accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>

The culture of the islands has been affected by the successive influences of [[Celtic language|Celtic]], [[Old Norse language|Norse]] and [[English language|English]] speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Most of the [[Hebrides]] have [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]] derivations, whilst those of the [[Northern Isles]] tend to be derived from the [[Viking]] names. A few have [[Brythonic]], [[Scots language|Scots]] and even perhaps pre-Celtic roots.<ref name=Smith/>

[[Rockall]], is a small rocky islet in the North Atlantic which was declared part of Scotland by the [[Island of Rockall Act 1972]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/21/newsid_4582000/4582327.stm| title=On This Day: 21 September| publisher=[[BBC]]| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970624/text/70624-02.htm| title=House of Lords Hansard| date=24 June, 1997| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref> However, the legality of the claim is disputed by the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]] and it is probably unenforceable in international law.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0268/D.0268.197311010090.html| title=Oral Questions to the Minister of Foreign Affairs| publisher=D<U+00E1>il <U+00C9>ireann| date=1 November, 1973| accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=MacDonald, Fraser| year=2006| title=The last outpost of Empire: Rockall and the Cold War| journal=Journal of Historical Geography| volume=32| pages=627-647| url=http://www.sages.unimelb.edu.au/staff/macdonald.html| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</ref>

==Larger islands==
This is a list of Scottish islands either with an area greater than 40&nbsp;hectares (approximately 100&nbsp;acres) and/or which are inhabited. The 'Groups' which in many cases provide a more useful guide to location than local authority areas are after Haswell-Smith (2004). The main Groups are: [[Firth of Clyde]], [[Islay]], [[Firth of Lorn]], [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], [[Small Isles]], [[Skye]], [[Lewis and Harris]], [[Uist]]s and [[Barra]], [[St Kilda]], [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and [[Firth of Forth]]. In a few cases where the island is either part of recognisable smaller group or archipelago, or is located away from the main groups, an archipelago, local authority or other descriptive name is used instead. "F" designates a freshwater island.

==Former islands==
[[Image:Inchgarvie.JPG|right|thumb|200px||Inchgarvie can be seen just below the [[Forth Bridge (railway)|Forth Bridge]]]]

The following is a list of places which were formerly islands, but by some definitions are no longer so, due to silting up, natural processes and harbour building.

* Inchbroach, now part of [[Montrose]] harbour
* [[Keith Inch]] (not to be confused with [[Inchkeith]]), is now part of [[Peterhead|Peterhead Harbour]], and hence is the [[Extreme points of the United Kingdom|easternmost point]] of 'mainland' [[Scotland]].

==Bridged islands==
[[Image:Skye Road Bridge.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Skye bridge]], [[Isle of Skye]]]]
Many of Scotland's islands are connected to the mainland/other islands by bridge or causeway. Although some people consider these to be no longer islands, they are generally treated as such.

'''Outer Hebrides'''

Many of the islands of the southern Outer Hebrides have been joined to other islands by causeways and bridges. These include:
* [[Baleshare]]
* [[Benbecula]]
* [[Berneray, North Uist|Berneray]]
* [[Eriskay]]
* [[Grimsay]]
* [[North Uist]]
* [[South Uist]]
* [[Vatersay]]

To the north, [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides|Scalpay]] and [[Great Bernera]] are connected to [[Lewis and Harris]].

'''Inner Hebrides'''
* [[Eilean Shona]] is connected to mainland [[Moidart]] by a bridge.

'''Orkney Islands'''
[[Image:Windwick, South Ronaldsay.jpg|thumb|200px|Looking south across Wind Wick, South Ronaldsay.]]
Similarly, four Orkney islands are joined to the [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney Mainland]] by a series of [[causeway]]s known as the [[Churchill Barriers]]. They are:
* [[South Ronaldsay]]
* [[Burray]]
* [[Lamb Holm]]
* [[Glims Holm]]

[[Hunda]] is in turn connected to Burray via a causeway.

There are ideas being discussed to build an undersea tunnel between the archipelago and [[Caithness]], at a length of about 9-10 miles (15-16 km) or (more likely) one connecting Orkney Mainland to Shapinsay,<ref>{{cite news| work=The Times| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1765366,00.html| date=September 5, 2005| title=Islanders see a brighter future with tunnel vision| author=David Lister| accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| date=10 Match 2005| url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=261472005| work=The Scotsman newspaper| title=<U+00A3>100m tunnel to Orkney 'feasible'| author=John Ross| accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref> although little has come of it.

'''Shetland Islands'''
Several Shetland islands are joined to the [[Mainland, Shetland|Shetland Mainland]]:
* [[West Burra]] and [[East Burra]] (via Trondra)
* [[Muckle Roe]]
* [[Trondra]]

There is also a bridge from [[Housay]] to [[Bruray]].

'''Skye'''
The [[Isle of Skye]] is connected to the mainland by the [[Skye Bridge]] which now incorporates [[Eilean B<U+00E0>n, Lochalsh|Eilean B<U+00E0>n]]. 

'''Others'''
Various other islands are also connected by bridges or causeways, to the mainland or other islands, including:
* [[Eilean Donan]] (to mainland)
* [[Eriska]] (to mainland)
* [[Inchgarvie]] (part of [[Forth Bridge (railway)|Forth Bridge]]), thus joined to both [[Fife]] and [[Lothian]] on the Mainland.
* [[Seil]] (to mainland)

==Tidal islands==
[[Image:Oronsay - Hebrides.jpg|thumb|200px|A beach on [[Oronsay, Inner Hebrides|Oronsay]] by [[Colonsay]], looking towards the Paps of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] in the distance.]]
There are a large number of small tidal islets in Scotland. The more notable ones include:
* [[Baleshare]]
* [[Calve Island]]
* [[Cramond Island]]
* [[Danna, Scotland|Danna]]
* [[Davaar Island]]
* [[Eilean Shona]]
* [[Eriska]]
* [[Erraid]]
* [[Isle Ristol]]
* [[Sanday, Inner Hebrides|Sanday]]
* [[Torsa]]

''[[Oronsay]]'' means 'ebb island' and there are several tidal islands of this name.<ref>[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/vli/language/gaelic/pdfs/placenamesK-O.pdf P<U+00E0>rlamaid na h-Alba placenames] Retrieved 16 July 2007.</ref>

[[St Ninian's Isle]] is connected to [[Mainland, Shetland|Mainland Shetland]] by a [[tombolo]]. Although greater than 40 hectares in size it fails to meet the definition of an island used in this list as it is only surrounded by water during occassional [[spring tide]]s and storms.<ref>[http://www.fettes.com/Shetland/tombolo.htm Fettes College Shetland Landscapes] Retrieved 3 August 2007.</ref>

== Places called "island" or "isle" which are not islands == 
[[Image:Burntisland 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Burntisland - not actually an island]]

Some places in Scotland are called islands or isles, but are not.  They include:

| [[Dumfries and Galloway]] 
|}</div><br clear="all">

Lewis and Harris are separated by a range of hills but form one island, and are sometimes referred to as "[[Lewis and Harris]]". Isle of Whithorn and the Black Isle are peninsulas, and Isleornsay is a village which looks out onto the island of [[Ornsay]]. There is no commonly accepted derivation for "Burntisland" which had numerous other forms in the past, such as "Brintilun" and "Ye Brint Eland".<ref>[http://www.burntisland.net/ Burntisland Online] Retrieved 22 June 2007.</ref>

The name "Inch" (''Innis'') can mean island (e.g. [[Inchkenneth]], [[Inchcolm]]), but is also used for dry land in a marsh e.g. [[Markinch]], [[Insch]].

''Eilean'' is [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] for "island". However, Inistrynich, Eilean na Maodail, Eilean Dubh and Liever Island are all [[promontory|promontories]] on [[Loch Awe]] as opposed to islands, despite their names. The Black Isle is also "An t-Eilean Dubh" in Gaelic, while [[Eilean Glas, Scalpay|Eilean Glas]] is part of Scalpay.
