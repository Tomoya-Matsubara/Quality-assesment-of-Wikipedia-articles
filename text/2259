'''UAM ''Creoula'''''{{#tag:ref|UAM: ''Unidades Auxiliares da Marinha'' (Naval Auxiliary Units)<ref>Baker 1999, p. 622.</ref>|group=nb}} is a training ship of the [[Portuguese Navy]], built in 1937 in the [[Companhia Uni<U+00E3>o Fabril]] (CUF) shipyards in [[Lisbon]] for Parceria Geral de Pescas fishing company. From 1938 to 1973 it was used in the Cod fishing campaigns in [[Newfoundland (island)|New Foundland]] and [[Greenland]]. Between 1973 and 1979 remain moored in Lisbon until it was bought in 1979 by the Secretary of State for Fishing to become a fishing museum, but during the repairs it was noticed that the hull was in excellent condition, so it was determined that the ship should sail again, therefore it became a Portuguese Navy training ship.
