'''''Ringo's Rotogravure''''' is the fifth album by [[Ringo Starr]], released in 1976. It would turn out to be the last album featuring active involvement from all four former Beatles before [[John Lennon]]'s death in 1980. Following the end of his contract with [[EMI]], Starr signed on with [[Polydor Records]] worldwide ([[Atlantic Records]] handling US distribution).

==Background and recording==
It was reported in December 1975 that [[ABC Records]] in the US was to sign former-[[Beatle]] [[Ringo Starr]] for a 5-year recording contract, worth $5 million.<ref name=Diary>{{cite book|editor=Miles, Barry; Badman, Keith |title=The Beatles Diary After the Break-Up: 1970-2001|year=2001|publisher=Music Sales Group|location=London|isbn=9780711983076|edition=reprint}}</ref> However, on 26 January 1976, when Starr's recording contract with [[EMI]] ended, he signed with [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] for the US and [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] for the UK, on 10 March.<ref name=RSE122>{{cite book|last=Harry |first=Bill |title=The Ringo Starr Encyclopedia |year=2004 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=9780753508435 |page=122}}</ref> As stated in the deal, Starr was expected to release 7 albums within 5 years, with the first album planned for release in June.<ref name=Diary/> This session would be Lennon's last until 1980.<ref name=Diary/>

{{quote box|quote= Well, Paul asked to write a song. I asked John and [...] eventually he came up with 'You Got Me Cooking'(sic). [...] I also asked George to write one, but there was an old one of his that was never released by anybody that I always loved. [...] I asked him if instead of writing one, could I have that old one? He said fine; it saved him a job. It's called 'I Still Love You', a big ballady thing.<ref name=Diary/>|source= <U+2013> Ringo Starr, upon being asked how he got material from his former-bandmates|width=25%|align=left|style=padding:8px;}}
Two years on from 1974's ''[[Goodnight Vienna]]'', Starr <U+2212> armed with new producer [[Arif Mardin]] <U+2212> again stuck to his tried-and-true formula of having friends write songs and play on the recordings. This time, [[Eric Clapton]] took part, in addition to his old friend [[Harry Nilsson]], and [[Peter Frampton]], [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Dr. John]], and former Beatles [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]].<ref name=FAQ37/> Sessions began in April at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]] in Los Angeles,<ref name=Diary/> and eventually moved on 12 June to [[Cherokee Studios|Cherokee Recording Studios]].<ref name=RSE122/> Starr is joined at this session by Lennon and his wife [[Yoko Ono]], recording "[[A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll]]", which features Lennon on piano,<ref name=RSE122/> and the Lennon-penned "Cookin' (In the Kitchen of Love)".<ref name=FAQ37>{{cite book|last=Rodriguez |first=Robert |title=Fab Four FAQ 2.0: The Beatles' Solo Years, 1970<U+2013>1980 |year=2010 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=New York|isbn=9780879309688 |edition=illustrated |page=37}}</ref><ref name=Diary/> The latter of which was written specifically for Starr.<ref name=RSE176>{{cite book|last=Harry |first=Bill |title=The Ringo Starr Encyclopedia |year=2004 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=9780753508435 |page=176}}</ref>

McCartney, while on break from his [[Wings Over the World|Wings Over America]] tour with [[Wings (band)|Wings]], made the backing track to "Pure Gold" along with his wife [[Linda McCartney]], which McCartney got Starr to sing over,<ref name=FAQ37/> on 19 June.<ref name=RSE122/> The song had been influenced by Starr's then-girlfriend [[Nancy Andrews (actress)|Nancy Andrews]],<ref name=FAQ37/> with whom he co-wrote "Las Brisas".<ref name=RSE9>{{cite book|last=Harry |first=Bill |title=The Ringo Starr Encyclopedia |year=2004 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=9780753508435 |page=9}}</ref> Harrison donated a song too, but because of his commitments to get his album ''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' done on schedule, he couldn't take part in any recording for ''Ringo's Rotogravure''.<ref name=GH/><ref name=FAQ37-38>{{cite book|last=Rodriguez |first=Robert |title=Fab Four FAQ 2.0: The Beatles' Solo Years, 1970<U+2013>1980 |year=2010 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=New York|isbn=9780879309688 |edition=illustrated |pages=37<U+2013>38}}</ref> Harrison's contribution was a song previously known as "[[I'll Still Love You|When Every Song Is Sung]]",<ref name=FAQ37-38/> which he had attempted to record first with [[Ronnie Spector]] [[Try Some, Buy Some#Planned Ronnie Spector solo album|in 1971]], then with [[Cilla Black]] (on which Starr also played), and later still with [[Leon Russell]]'s wife Mary.<ref name=GH>{{cite book|last=Harrison |first=George |title=I Me Mine |year=2002 |publisher=Chronicle Books |location=San Francisco, CA |page=228}}</ref> [[Eric Clapton]] played guitar on the track "This Be Called a Song".<ref name=RSE174>{{cite book|last=Harry |first=Bill |title=The Ringo Starr Encyclopedia |year=2004 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=9780753508435 |page=174}}</ref> Several unreleased tracks were recorded during the sessions: "Where Are You Going", "All Right" and "It's Hard to Be Lovers".<ref name=Diary/>
