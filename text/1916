'''ROKS ''Cheonan'' (PCC-772)''' was a [[South Korea]]n [[Pohang class corvette|Pohang-class]] [[corvette]] of the [[Republic of Korea Navy]] (ROKN), commissioned in 1989.

On 30 March 2010 it was reported that one South Korean naval diver had died after losing consciousness whilst searching for survivors and another had been hospitalised.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8594226.stm|title= Diver dies at South Korean warship rescue site|date=30 March 2010|work=BBC News|accessdate=30 March 2010}}</ref>

On 3 April 2010, South Korean officials said that a private fishing boat involved in the rescue operations had collided with a [[Cambodia]]n freighter, sinking the fishing boat and killing at least two people, with seven reported missing.<ref name=AP-20100403 /> The same day, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said that one body of the 46 missing sailors had been found.<ref name=AP-20100403 /><ref name="BBC fishing boat">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8601540.stm|title=Nine missing as S Korean boat sinks in warship search| work=BBC News Online|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

Later on 3 April 2010 South Korea called off the rescue operation for the missing sailors, after families of the sailors asked for the operation to be suspended for fear of further casualties among the rescue divers. The military's focus then shifted towards salvage operations, which were predicted to take up to a month to complete.<ref name=AP-20100403>{{cite news|url= http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jQydsIWmNQZpwRriADac51u5rx8gD9ERMARG1|title=SKorea stops underwater search for missing sailors|author=Kwang-Tae Kim|date=3 April 2010 |work=The Associated Press|accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref>

====Cause of sinking====
{{Duplication}}
{{Main|ROKS Cheonan sinking#Investigation}}
On 25 April 2010, South Korea's defense minister, [[Kim Tae-Young (R.O.K. Army general)|Kim Tae-Young]], said that the most likely cause of the explosion that sank the ''Cheonan'' was a [[torpedo]]; his statements were the first time that a South Korean official publicly cited such a cause. Kim said that "A [[Naval_mine#Bubble_jet_effect|bubble jet]] caused by a heavy torpedo is thought to be the most likely thing to be blamed, but various other possibilities are also under review." A bubble jet is caused by an underwater explosion which changes the pressure of water, and whose force can cause a ship to break apart. The bubble jet theory was supported by one of the investigators into the incident, who had said that there was no evidence that an explosion had occurred in contact with a ship, and that a non-contact explosion had most likely broken the ship in half.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/world/asia/26korea.html|title=South Korea Cites Torpedo Attack in Ship Sinking| work=The New York Times|date=25 April 2010|accessdate=25 April 2010 | first=Choe | last=Sang-Hun}}</ref>

On 20 May 2010, an international commission investigating the sinking of ''Cheonan'' presented its findings, and said that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack.<ref name="BBC 20 May">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10129703.stm|title='North Korean torpedo' sank South's navy ship - report| work=BBC News |date=20 May 2010|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/20_05_10jigreport.pdf|title=Investigation Result on the Sinking of ROKS "Cheonan" by The Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group|date=20 May 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>
The torpedo parts recovered at the site of the explosion by a dredging ship on May 15, which include 5x5 bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, were claimed to perfectly match the schematics of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North Korea for export purposes, but the brochures were never made public. The markings in [[Hangul]], which read "1<U+BC88>" (or No. 1 in English), found inside the end of the propulsion section were said to have been consistent with markings on a previously obtained North Korean torpedo.<ref name="Ministry of National Defense R.O.K. News"/>  However, some have pointed out that in the North, "<U+D638>"(pronounced "ho") is most often used rather than "<U+BC88>"; and that a North Korean torpedo found seven years ago bears the marking "4<U+D638>".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/421856.html|title=Questions Raised Following Cheonan Announcement| work=The Hankyoreh|21 May 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> Russian and Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages.

If a smaller class submarine was involved, there is a bigger question mark."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/05/205_66234.html|title=Questions Raised About 'Smoking Gun'|work=The Korea Times|20 May 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>

One member of the investigative team, Shin Sang-cheol, who would be summoned on charges of spreading unsubstantiated rumors, publicly expressed doubts by saying "The magnified photo of the evidence showed that the marking was written on the rusted surface.  If it were the North who marked it, the marking should have been written on a smooth surface."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2921120|title=Probe member summoned on false rumor allegations|work=JoonAng Daily|date=29 May 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> The Ministry of Defense had earlier tried to remove Shin from the investigative team, saying that "He is not qualified to work as part of the investigation team, as he has been spreading malicious rumors, as well as lacks expertise and has been insincere in his participation in the probe."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/10/116_65828.html|title=Gov't seeks to replace Cheonan investigator| work=The Korea Times| date=13 May 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>

On 13 September 2010, the final report was issued by JIG which concluded that, "The Cheonan was split and sunk due to a shockwave and bubble effect generated by the underwater explosion of a torpedo. The detonation location was three meters to port from the center of the gas turbine room and at a depth of 6-9 meters..."  Their conclusion was that the torpedo did not physically hit the ship, but the explosion was close enough and destructive enough to sink it.<ref name="korea times final report">{{cite news |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/09/205_72997.html|title=Seoul reaffirms North Korea<U+2019>s torpedo attack in final report|publisher=Korea Times|date=13 September 2010|accessdate=13 Sep 2010}}</ref>
