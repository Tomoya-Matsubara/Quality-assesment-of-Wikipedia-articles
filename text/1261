'''Scott Philip Brown''' (born September 12, 1959), an American politician, is the junior [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]]. Brown is a member of the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican Party]]. He previously served as a member of the [[Massachusetts General Court]], first in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|State House of Representatives]] (1998<U+2013>2004) and then in the [[Massachusetts Senate|State Senate]] (2004<U+2013>2010).

Brown faced the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General [[Martha Coakley]], in the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|2010 special election]] to succeed U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown closed the gap in the first weeks of January 2010 before going on to win the election. Brown became the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since [[Edward Brooke]] in 1972.<ref name="elec1">{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/senate/scott-brown-wins-massachusetts-senate-race.html|title=Scott Brown wins Massachusetts Senate special election race|work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 19, 2010}}</ref>

Prior to entering the state legislature, he had experience as a town [[Board of Selectmen|selectman]] and assessor. He is a practicing [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]], concentrating in [[Property law|real estate law]] and serving as defense counsel in the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|Judge Advocate General's Corps]] of the [[Massachusetts Army National Guard]]. Brown is a graduate of [[Wakefield High School (Wakefield, Massachusetts)|Wakefield High School]] (1977), [[Tufts University]] (1981), and [[Boston College Law School]] (1985).

==Non-political career==
===Army National Guard service===
Brown has said the rescue efforts of [[Army National Guard]] during the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978]] impressed him. He joined the [[Massachusetts Army National Guard]] when he was 19, receiving his basic training at [[Fort Dix, New Jersey]],<ref name="dog" /> and attending [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) classes at the campus of [[Northeastern University]].<ref name="key">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/07/guard_service_a_key_to_candidate_brown/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=January 16, 2010|title=Guard service a key to candidate Brown|first=Brian C.|last=Mooney}}</ref> He was trained in [[Infantry Branch (United States)|infantry]], [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|quartermaster]], and [[airborne forces|airborne]] duties, and in 1994 he joined the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] (JAG).<ref name="key" /> He has been active in the Guard for about 30 years and has risen to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]]. As the Army Guard's head [[defense attorney]] in [[New England]], Brown defended Guard members who had disciplinary difficulties such as positive [[drug tests]],<ref name="live" /> and provided [[estate planning]] and [[real estate]] advice to those who are about to deploy to war zones.<ref name="key" /> Brown has not served in [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]], but said in 2009 that he was prepared to go if called. "I go where they order me to go... I'm just proud to serve and be part of the team."<ref name="live" /> He spent ten days to two weeks with the Guard in [[Kazakhstan]] and a week in [[Paraguay]].<ref name="live" />

He was awarded the Army [[Commendation Medal]] for meritorious service in [[homeland security]] shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name="bio" /> He credits his military experience with causing him to focus on [[veteran]]'s issues as well as issues of war and peace.<ref name="live" /> He has served on the Veterans and Federal Affairs Committee, the Hidden Wounds of War Commission, and the Governor's Task Force on Returning Veterans during his career as a legislator.<ref name="live" />

===Modeling===
In June 1982, Brown, then a 22-year-old law student at Boston College, won ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine's "America's Sexiest Man" contest. After two weeks on a [[crash diet]] of "three cans of tuna a day" and intensive workouts<ref name="arsenault20110217">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/02/17/brown_describes_childhood_of_beatings_sexual_abuse/?page=full|title=Brown describes beatings, sexual abuse in childhood|date=2011-02-17|first=Mark and Christopher Rowland|last=Arsenault|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> he was featured in the magazine's [[centerfold]], posing [[nude]] but strategically positioned so that according to Brown, "You don't see anything".

==Early political career==
Brown "caught the political bug" in 1992 when he was elected property [[assessor (property)|assessor]] of [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]].<ref name="live" /> In 1995, he was elected to the Wrentham [[Board of Selectmen]]. 

He successfully ran for the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in 1998, representing the 9th Norfolk District for three terms. Brown again moved up the ladder of state politics to the state Senate in March 2004 when he won a special election to replace Democrat [[Cheryl Jacques]]. Brown was re-elected for a full term in November 2004, and again in November 2006, running without opposition the second time. He won re-election in November 2008, defeating Democratic candidate Sara Orozco by a 59<U+2013>41 percent margin. Following his re-election, Brown was one of five Republicans in the 40-seat Massachusetts senate. In the Massachusetts Senate, Brown served on committees dealing with consumer protection, professional licensing, education, election laws, public safety, and veterans' affairs.<ref name="glance" />

In February 2007, a controversy arose after Brown's appearance at [[King Philip Regional High School]] in [[Wrentham, Massachusetts]] as part of a debate on [[gay marriage]]. The high school students had launched a [[Facebook]] group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, [[Ayla Brown|Ayla]]. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front of a high school audience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/homepage/8998943093096972286|title=Brown on hot seat after quoting 'F' word at school appearance|author=Heather McCarron|work=[[The MetroWest Daily News]] |date=February 10, 2007}}</ref>

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that during six terms in the Legislature, three each in the House and Senate, Brown has a modest record of legislative initiatives, but he has carved out a niche as a leading advocate for [[veterans]]. [[Richard R. Tisei]] of [[Wakefield, Massachusetts]], the leader of the Republican minority in the state Senate, called Brown "the acknowledged expert on veterans' issues."<ref name="www.boston.com">[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/07/guard_service_a_key_to_candidate_brown/ "Guard Service a Key to Candidate Brown"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' January 7, 2010</ref> State Senator [[Jack Hart (state senator)|Jack Hart]], a Democrat of [[South Boston]], said: "He does his homework, he's comprehensive in his approach, and on veterans' issues, he's one of them and has done a very good job on their behalf."<ref name="www.boston.com" />

As a legislator, Brown lists among his achievements his authorship of a 2007 law that created a check-off box on state income tax forms for veterans to indicate whether they served in Iraq or Afghanistan. The state uses the information to notify veterans of available services and benefits, including the Welcome Home Bonus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=veteransterminal&L=2&L0=Home&L1=Returning+Veterans&sid=Eveterans&b=terminalcontent&f=bonuses_gwot&csid=Eveterans |title=Welcome Home Bonus |publisher=Mass.gov |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref> that provides $1,000 for those returning from active duty in Afghanistan or Iraq.<ref name="www.boston.com" />

Brown won a landslide victory in the Republican primary on December 8, 2009, defeating late entrant and [[perennial candidate]] [[Jack E. Robinson III|Jack E.

Brown's opponents in the general election were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and [[independent (politician)|independent]] [[Joseph L. Kennedy]] (no relation to the [[Kennedy family]]). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics.<ref name="Globe 12-08-09">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/12/scott_brown_win.html|title=Scott Brown wins GOP primary, readies for race against Coakley|first=Michael|last=Levenson|date=December 8, 2009|work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.<ref name="myfox 1-18-10">{{cite news|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/politics/local_politics/poll-scott-brown-surges-to-double-digit-lead-over-martha-coakley|date=January 18, 2010|title=Poll: Scott Brown surges to double-digit lead over Martha Coakley|publisher=My Fox Boston}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_MA_45398436.pdf|title=Senate Race Competitive|date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010|publisher=[[Public Policy Polling]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://insidemedford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/ma-senate-poll-results.pdf|title=Senate poll results}}</ref><ref name="parker">{{cite news|work=[[The Washington Post]] |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/08/AR2010010803591.html|title=A Republican Senate upset in Massachusetts?|date=January 10, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2010|authorlink=Kathleen Parker|first=Kathleen|last=Parker}}</ref>

After the amendment failed, Brown did vote for the main bill which, along with other patient rights, requires healthcare workers and hospitals to provide such care.<ref name="daughters">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/coakley_campaig_1.html |title=Brown's daughters call for Coakley to take down ad |date=January 12, 2010 |first=Matt|last=Viser |work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}</ref> Coakley's ad featured a male voice that said, "Brown even favors letting hospitals deny emergency contraception to rape victims," over the ad's graphic which had the words, "Deny care to rape victims."<ref name="daughters" /> Brown's daughter [[Ayla Brown|Ayla]] called the Coakley ad "completely inaccurate and misleading", and stated that her father would never deny care to a rape victim.

==Political positions==
[[File:Barack Obama with Scott Brown.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Brown meets [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in the [[Oval Office]], June 2010.]]
Brown has positioned himself as a [[American conservative|conservative]] counterweight to Massachusetts' previously all-Democratic, 12-member congressional delegation.<ref name="live" /><ref name="dog" /> He describes himself as socially moderate and fiscally conservative. He identifies himself as a "[[Reagan Republican]]". He has said, "I'm going to be the only person down there who is going to be the independent voter and thinker... I've always been the underdog in one shape or form."<ref name="dog" />

===Fiscal policy===
Brown opposes a proposed multi-billion dollar tax on banks to recoup bailout money and prescribing of bank executive compensation. Brown, discussing the proposal through a spokesperson, said that he is "opposed to higher taxes, especially in the midst of a [[recession of 2008|severe recession]]". He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] fees.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/01/brown_criticize.html|title=Mass.

The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]], stating: "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get our economy moving again.<U+2019><U+2019><ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/09/15/senate_oks_tax_breaks_for_small_businesses/ Small-business tax breaks clear a hurdle in the Senate 'Brown decries plan, calling it a new bailout; End of filibuster a win for Obama']. September 15, 2010</ref>

On December 12, 2010, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that "[c]ampaign contributions to [Brown] from the financial industry spiked sharply during a critical three-week period last summer as the fate of the [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Wall Street regulatory overhaul]] hung in the balance and Brown used the leverage of his swing vote to win key concessions sought by firms."<ref name="Globe">Slack, Donovan (2010-12-12) [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2010/12/12/banks_donations_soared_as_brown_negotiated/?page=full Donations poured in as Brown<U+2019>s role grew], ''[[Boston Globe]]''</ref> Brown received more than ten times the amount of contributions from the [[financial services industry]] as [[House Financial Services Committee]] chairman (and author of the legislation) [[Barney Frank]] during the same period.<ref name="Globe" /> According to the ''[[Boston Globe|Globe]]'':

<blockquote>
Brown<U+2019>s efforts benefited large Massachusetts companies such as [[MassMutual Financial Group]], [[Liberty Mutual Insurance]], [[Fidelity Investments]], and [[State Street Corporation|State Street Corp.]], whose executives and [[political action committee]]s contributed $29,000 to Brown during the three-week period he was extracting the concessions from Democrats.

They also benefited major out-of-state institutions such as [[Goldman Sachs]], [[UBS]], and [[JPMorgan Chase]]. Those and other out-of-state financial interests gave Brown a total of $50,000 during the period.<ref name="Globe" />
</blockquote>

===Foreign policy===
Brown supports President Barack Obama's decision to send 30,000 more troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|fight in Afghanistan]]. He cited [[Stanley McChrystal]]'s recommendations as a reason for his support.<ref name="live" /> He also advocates that suspected [[terrorist]]s be tried in [[military tribunal]]s and not civilian courts.<ref name="key" /> He also supports the limited use of "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]", including [[waterboarding]] against non-citizen terrorist suspects.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brown and Coakley clash over terror suspects' rights|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/05/brown_coakley_clash_over_suspected_terrorists_rights/ |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | first=Brian C. | last=Mooney}}</ref> He supports a [[two-state solution]] for the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]] in which Israel and a new, independent [[Palestinian state]] would co-exist side by side.<ref name="caller" />

===Veteran services===
In 2007, Brown wrote a law establishing a check off box on State income tax forms to allow a filer to indicate if he or she is a veteran of the [[Iraq War|Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] wars. The measure's purpose is to locate and inform returning veterans of benefits they qualify for.  Known as the "Welcome Home" bonus, it was passed with [[bipartisan]] support.<ref name="bio" />  Brown also amended the [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], with Senator [[Jack Reed (politician)|Jack Reed]] ([[Rhode Island|RI]]), to create a dedicated military liaison office within the newly formed [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], which aside from defending against unscrupulous lenders, also ensures protection of military families against fraudulent life insurance policies.  The measure passed the [[U.S. Senate]] 99 to 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h4173enr.txt.pdf |title=H.R. 4173 (111th Congress) |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]}}</ref>

===Health care===
Brown supported the 2006 [[Massachusetts health care reform]], which requires all residents to have [[health insurance]], with a state-subsidized plan created for those who cannot afford to insure themselves. Brown does not support President Obama's health care reform plan in its current form as approved by the Democratic-led House and Senate.  He has stated this plan is fiscally unsound, and during his campaign notably pledged to be the 41st vote to [[filibuster]] the bill in the Senate.<ref>{{cite news

Brown voted for a state measure on patients' rights that, among other provisions, requires emergency rooms to provide what is known as the [[emergency contraception|morning-after pill]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/morning-pill-spurs-abortion-controversy/story?id=9700748 |title=Pregnancy Prevention or Abortion?

In consideration of health care workers who might have a religious objection to administering this medication, Brown attached what became known as the Conscientious Objector amendment which would have exempted these workers, as well as religious hospitals, from being required to provide this medication.  However, Brown's amendment also required that all hospitals still had to provide a means for the patient to receive the medication, either by providing another healthcare worker willing to administer the medication, or, in the case of religious hospitals, to provide transportation to another facility, and in a timely manner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/24/nation/la-na-scott-brown24-2010jan24 |title=What makes Scott Brown run? |author=Kathleen Hennessey |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref>  The amendment did not pass.<ref name="Estes">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/01/06/in_debate_senate_candidates_seek_to_define_differences/?page=full |title=In debate, Senate candidates seek to define differences |author=Andrea Estes |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}</ref> Brown remains in favor of allowing religious hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraception on moral or religious grounds, as he stated in the January 5, 2010 candidate debate.<ref name="Estes" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.969bostontalks.com/Podcasts/1466/010510senatedebatepart1.mp3 |title=96.9 Boston Talks podcast of the January 5, 2010 debate |date= |accessdate=2010-07-05}}</ref>

===Energy policy===
He supports expanding [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], and [[nuclear power]], and [[offshore drilling]] exploration as a means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.<ref name="dog" /> Although, when faced with the controversial issue of whether an [[Cape Wind|offshore wind farm]] should be allowed in the waters off the Cape Cod coast in Massachusetts, a major tourist destination and boating location, he expressed opposition due to the fact he believed it would hinder tourism and boating in the area.<ref>{{cite news |author=Seelye, K.
