The '''Bernard SIMB V.2''' was a single-seat, single-engine [[France|French]] [[monoplane]], built in the mid-1920s.  It was originally designed for [[Air racing|racing]] but was adapted for a successful attempt on the world absolute speed record.

==Design and development==
Design of the Bernard V.2 was begun at the same time as that of the [[Bernard V.1]], with the intention of entering both models into the Beaumont Cup competition held in June 1924, but the V.2 was completed too late for entry and the V.1 was destroyed before the competition.<ref name=LironB/>  Bernard then decided to use the V.2 in an attempt on the world airspeed record<ref name=LironB/> held for the [[U.S.A.]] by A.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Williams in a [[Curtiss R-6]] at 429&nbsp;km/h (267&nbsp;mph).<ref name=FlightRec/>  The nickname '''Ferbois''' was often used instead of SIMB, so the V.2 sometimes appears as the '''Bernard-Ferbois V.2.<ref name=FlightRec/>
  
The V.2 was a [[cantilever]] [[wing configuration#Number and position of main-planes|mid wing]] [[monoplane]]. Its all wood wings were built with multicellular construction around two parallel spars and the surfaces [[sand paper|sanded]] and [[lacquer|lacquered]] to reduce [[parasitic drag|friction drag]]. In plan the wings were straight tapered, mostly on the [[trailing edge]], with oblique tips.  The [[ailerons]] were near triangular, reaching to the wing tips; there were no [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]].<ref name=LironB/>  Aluminium [[fairing (aircraft)|fairings]] blended the [[wing root]]s into the [[fuselage]]; similar fairings were used at the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] roots.<ref name=LironB/><ref name=FlightParis24/>  The elevators had straight, swept [[leading edge]]s and were set at the top of the fuselage.  They carried separate elevators with a cut-out for [[rudder]] movement.  The latter was wide and almost rectangular, its upper edge blending into an almost triangular, wide [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] [[fin]].<ref name=LironB/>

The wooden [[monocoque]] fuselage was equally refined and polished, its oval section tapering towards the tail.  Towards the nose the fuselage flattened to accommodate the three four-cylinder blocks of its 340&nbsp;kW (450&nbsp;hp) W-12 [[Hispano-Suiza 12 G]]b engine, driving a low-set two-blade [[propeller]] with a large [[Spinner (aircraft)|spinner]].  This was water-cooled, with under-wing radiators from the root to half span, assisted by a single ventral radiator just aft of the undercarriage.  The fixed, [[conventional undercarriage|tricycle undercarriage]] had unfaired single mainwheels on a single axle, attached by [[bungee cord]] to two flat, [[aircraft fairing|faired]], tapered legs. These legs were cross-braced with streamlined stays.  The open cockpit was at the wing trailing edge.  Because the Hispano engine of the V.2 was mounted lower in the nose than the Lorraine-Dietrich, another W-12, of the V.1, the central cylinder bank did not so completely obscure the pilot's forward view.<ref name=LironB/>

Some modifications, detailed below, were made to the V.2 before its successful attempt on the world speed record.  The '''Bernard (or SIMB) V.3''' was a proposed, unbuilt development with a retractable undercarriage and a Lorraine-Dietricht engine.<ref name=LironB/>

==Operational history==
The V.2 made its first flight from [[Istres]] on  2 October 1924, piloted by Florentin Bonnet.  Five more test flights followed until, despite a few small problems, the aircraft was judged ready for an attempt on the airspeed record. The V.2 returned an average speed of 393&nbsp;km/h (244&nbsp;mph) after four passes of a 3&nbsp;km (1.86&nbsp;mi) track.  This was a new French national record but not the sought after world record.<ref name=LironB/>

During November, several test flights and alterations were made.  The most significant changes were to the wings where two successive span reductions produced a final value of 9.10&nbsp;m (29&nbsp;ft&nbsp;10&nbsp;in) and an area of 10.8&nbsp;m<U+00B2> (112.8 sq&nbsp;ft).  The ailerons were also modified. The dorsal radiator was removed and the engine moved forward under an improved cowling; the wooden propeller was replaced by a metal one made by Levasseur.  The cockpit was raised and moved forward a little to improve the pilot's view.<ref name=LironB/> A second attempt on the speed record was made on 11 December 1924, when an average speed of 448&nbsp;km/h (279&nbsp;mph) was achieved.  After a short delay whilst the FAI rules were debated, this was homologated as the absolute world speed record and stood for almost three years.<ref name=LironB/><ref name=FlightRec/>

Later that December a full size replica of the V.2 appeared at the Paris Aero Show claiming, in anticipation of homologation, that it was the record holder.  The model differed from the real V.2 in several details.  The genuine aircraft did appear once on public display, at the Petit Palace in Paris in November 1933, after which it was scrapped.<ref name=LironB/>
