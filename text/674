The '''Fiat Linea''' is a [[small family car]] released in 2007 by the Italian automaker [[Fiat]] as a [[world car]] in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]] and [[Middle East]]. <ref name="reuters.com"/> It replaced the aging [[Fiat Marea|Marea]] as the largest [[sedan (car)|saloon]] in the Fiat range. It is based on the current [[Fiat Grande Punto]] platform. The Linea was designed by Fiat Style Centre and co-developed by Fiat do Brasil and [[Tofa<U+015F>]] from Turkey.

Linea's size is similar to saloon versions of other small family cars, like the [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]], [[Renault M<U+00E9>gane]] and [[Opel Astra]]. Its wheelbase is {{convert|2603|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, i.e. {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than its sister models, and its total length is {{convert|4560|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} or {{convert|500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer.

Launched in September 2008 in [[Brazil]], the Linea is available with a 1.9&nbsp;L 16v "Torque" engine with {{convert|132|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, flexible for the Brazilian market (capable of using [[petrol]] or [[ethanol]]). Also in [[Brazil]] the Linea is available with a 1.4&nbsp;L 16v T-Jet engine with {{convert|152|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, the same engine used in [[Fiat Grande Punto]] Abarth in [[Europe]], capable of using only petrol, as this engine is imported.

Launched in January 2009 in [[India]], the Linea is available with a {{convert|86|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.3 L Multijet Diesel Engine and {{convert|90|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.4 L "Fire" Petrol Engine.

For the Russian market, the top engine will be the 1.6&nbsp;L [[Chery ACTECO engine|ACTECO]] licensed from [[Chery Automobile|Chery]].

==Car systems==
Linea is equipped with [[Blue&Me]] hands-free system, a Microsoft Windows Mobile based system with multi-language voice recognition and speech functions. Allows to browse mobile phone's book, reads aloud SMS and controls the audio system - using built-in USB port, one can connect PenDrive with music in MP3 and WMA formats.

In Brazil the Linea can be equipped optionally with a Blue&Me Nav system, an enhanced Blue&Me system that has a [[Automotive navigation system|GPS system]] integrated. This GPS system doesn't show maps in a touch screen, but it has a regular display that shows some arrows and directions and you are also guided by voice instructions. You can either enter addresses that you want to go and other instructions by voice instructions just like the regular Blue&Me system or using the controls on the steering whell. The Linea is the first car in Brazil that has an integrated GPS system.
