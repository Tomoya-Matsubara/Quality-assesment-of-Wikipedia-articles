'''"[[Portsmouth (song)|Portsmouth]]"''' is a [[single (music)|single]] released by musician [[Mike Oldfield]] in 1976 (see [[1976 in music]]). It is Oldfield's highest charting single in the [[United Kingdom]], charting at number 3.

== Details ==
In an attempt to repeat the success of his previous year's Christmas hit, "[[In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback|In Dulci Jubilo]]", Mike recorded another traditional folk melody dating from 1701 (first known publication),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/folkdance.geo/page5.html |publisher=Folkdance.geo |title=Folk Dances |accessdate=2009-02-27|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/folkdance.geo/page5.html&date=2009-10-25+22:17:59|archivedate=2009-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pteratunes.org.uk/Music/Music/playford.html |title=Tunes from Playford's Dancing Master |publisher=Pteratunes |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> again using [[Leslie Penning]] on [[recorder]]s.  The single was just as successful as its predecessor, charting at number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=everyHit.com |publisher=everyHit.com |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> and became his first non-album single to be issued in the USA. It also charted at number 19 in [[Irish Singles Chart|Ireland]]. Mike Oldfield plays acoustic guitar, accordion, mandolin, [[ARP String Synthesizer|ARP string synthesiser]], tambourine, kettle drum and [[bodhran]] (Irish drum), and both Oldfield and Penning are credited with "[[step dance|feet]]".<ref name="boxed">''[[Boxed (Mike Oldfield album)|Boxed]]'' album liner notes</ref>

This song, plus two others chosen as the B-side in different countries, had been released the month before as three of four new songs on the compilation album ''[[Boxed (Mike Oldfield album)|Boxed]]''.  They were mixed and encoded for SQ [[quadraphonic]] sound, the only format this album was issued in, and all issues of these songs in vinyl and tape formats have the encoding, even if they only say "stereo" on the label, as do all single releases.

"Argiers" is another traditional folk song, performed by Leslie Penning on recorders and Mike Oldfield on acoustic guitar and [[ARP String Synthesizer|ARP string synthesiser]].  An unusual feature of this arrangement is that it is in a minor key, having been converted from its original major key via [[transposition (music)|diatonic transposition]].  "Portsmouth" and "Argiers" were both recorded in January 1976 at Througham, [[Gloucestershire]], Mike's new home studio, shortly after he moved from his previous home in [[Hergest Ridge]], which was the location of his previous home studio, the Beacon.<ref name="boxed"/>

"Speak (Tho' You Only Say Farewell)" is an old show tune performed by [[David Bedford]] on piano and vocals, and Mike Oldfield on vocals.  It is similar in style to Bedford's earlier work in the [[Coxhill-Bedford Duo]] with [[Lol Coxhill]], and was recorded at the Beacon in November 1974.<ref name="boxed"/>

The song is featured on the [[Mercury Records]] reissue of ''[[Ommadawn]]'', released on 7 June 2010.

The single has been issued 3 times in France, in 1976, 1977 and 1980, with 3 different sleeves.

== Music video ==
A music video was made for this song, and can be found on the DVD, ''[[Elements - The Best of Mike Oldfield (video)|Elements - The Best of Mike Oldfield]]''.  Shot in Mike's Througham studio, it shows four female folk dancers who dance around the studio, while Mike is seen playing various instruments.  As in the video for Mike's previous single, "In Dulci Jubilo", the video emphasizes that Mike plays all the instruments, even though this is not strictly true.

== In popular culture ==
The piece was featured in the 1979 [[NASA]] documentary film by [[Tony Palmer]], ''[[The Space Movie]]''.

The song has become synonymous with English football club, [[Portsmouth F.C.]], who sometimes play the tune before or after games at their home stadium, [[Fratton Park]].  Notably it was played during their victorious [[FA Cup 2007-08|FA Cup 2008]] campaign, including after the final game against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] on 17 May 2008 at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]].

In April 2010 two groups were set up on the social networking site [[Facebook]] to encourage people to download the single "Portsmouth" via sites such as [[iTunes]] in the week commencing 3 May 2010, in a hope to get into the [[UK Singles Chart]], before Portsmouth F.C.'s [[2009<U+2013>10 FA Cup|FA Cup Final]] appearance against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref name="port">{{cite web |url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/people/Tubular-Bells-star39s-joy-as.6272706.jp |title=Tubular Bells star's joy as fans attempt to get his Portsmouth song to No1 |publisher=The News Portsmouth.co.uk |date=2010-05-05 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quayradio.com/minisite/portsmouth-song-chart.php |title=Get Mike Oldfield's 'Portsmouth' back into the chart! |publisher=Quay Radio Portsmouth |date=2010-05-01 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref> Oldfield himself has commented on the campaign.<ref name="port"/><ref>{{youtube|id=Wv0BLgITMC0|title=Mike Oldfield interview on Quay Radio Portsmouth}}</ref> It however did not chart.
