The '''2010 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship''' was the 40th annual single-elimination tournament to determine the national championship for [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's [[college lacrosse]]. Sixteen teams were selected to compete in the tournament based upon their performance during the regular season, and for some, a conference tournament.<ref name=balt/> The championship game took place on May 31, [[Memorial Day]], between the [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse|Duke Blue Devils]] and the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], with the latter making their first appearance in the NCAA final. Duke won in [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], 6<U+2013>5, to capture their first men's lacrosse championship in school history.

==Venues==
[[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] was selected as the host for the final and semifinals, which were held at [[M&T Bank Stadium]], the home field of the [[Baltimore Ravens]] of the [[National Football League]]. The tournament was co-hosted by the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Loyola University Maryland]], and [[Towson University]].<ref name=balt/> [[Stony Brook University]] in [[Stony Brook, New York]] and [[Princeton University]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] hosted the quarterfinals.

In order to host the event, Baltimore competed against [[Boston]]; [[Denver]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; and [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. Baltimore promoted its strong lacrosse heritage and M&T Bank Stadium's close proximity to a wide range of hotels, restaurants, and shopping centers.<ref name=balt>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/lacrosse/bal-sp.ncaalax07feb07,0,6438929.story Baltimore to host lacrosse final four in 2010, 2011], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', February 7, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://blogs.insidelacrosse.com/2009/02/06/ncaa-decision-on-championship-weekend-future-sites-coming-today/ NCAA Decision on Lacrosse Championship Weekend Sites Coming Today], ''[[Inside Lacrosse]]'', February 6, 2009.</ref>

==Selection process==
The championship teams of six conferences were granted automatic tournament berths. Five of those were based upon the results of conference tournaments. The [[ECAC Lacrosse League|Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC) did not hold a conference tournament and granted its automatic qualifier to regular season champions [[Denver Pioneers|Denver]]. Conference tournament champions that automatically qualified were: [[Army Black Knights men's lacrosse|Army]] of the [[Patriot League]], [[Delaware Fighting Blue Hens men's lacrosse|Delaware]] of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]] (CAA), [[Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers|Mount Saint Mary's]] of the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] (MAAC), [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|Princeton]] of the [[Ivy League]], and [[Stony Brook Seawolves|Stony Brook]] of the [[America East Conference]].<ref name=bracket>[http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/09/warrior-may-madness-ncaa-division-i-bracket-here Warrior May Madness: NCAA Division I Bracket is here], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 9, 2010.</ref>

The selection committee granted the other ten tournament teams at-large berths. All four [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) teams received at-large bids for the fourth straight year: [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Virginia]], [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]], [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|North Carolina]], and [[Duke Blue Devils men's lacrosse|Duke]]. Two berths were filled by the [[Big East Conference]]: [[Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse|Syracuse]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse|Notre Dame]]. Ivy League runners-up [[Cornell Big Red men's lacrosse|Cornell]], independent [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]], [[Loyola Greyhounds men's lacrosse|Loyola]] of the ECAC, and [[Hofstra Pride men's lacrosse|Hofstra]] of the CAA were also selected.<ref name=bracket/>

Notable teams considered to be "on the bubble" for selection, but not chosen, included [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]] and [[Villanova Wildcats men's lacrosse|Villanova]] of the Big East, [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale]] and [[Brown Bears men's lacrosse|Brown]] of the Ivy League, and [[Drexel Dragons|Drexel]] and [[UMass Minutemen men's lacrosse|UMass]] of the CAA.<ref name=bracket/> The selection of some at-large teams such as Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins instead of Georgetown, which missed the tournament for the third straight season, was considered a questionable snub by some analysts.<ref>Mark Dixon, [http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/11/mark-dixons-truth-or-fiction-tournament-selection-edition Mark Dixon's Truth or Fiction: Tournament Selection Edition], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 11, 2010.</ref><ref>Geoff Shannon, [http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/09/snubs-and-surprises-mens-di-ncaa-tournament-field Snubs and Surprises from Men's DI NCAA Tournament Field], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 9, 2010.</ref><ref>Trish Lamonte, [http://blog.syracuse.com/sports/2010/05/big_east_lacrosse_syracuse_ran.html Big East Lacrosse: Syracuse ranked No. 2 in final poll; NCAA tournament committee snubs Georgetown], ''[[The Post-Standard]]'', May 10, 2010.</ref>

==Game summaries==
===First round===
The biggest surprise of the first round was Army's double-overtime upset of No. 2 seed Syracuse at the [[Carrier Dome]]. Some analysts ranked it among the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament.<ref>Sean Burns, [http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/17/may-madness-armys-win-over-syracuse-biggest-ncaa-tournament-upset-ever May Madness: Is Army's win over Syracuse the biggest NCAA tournament upset ever?], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 17, 2010.</ref><ref>Patrick Stevens, [http://d1scourse.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/contextualizing-armys-upset-in-a-historical-sense.html Putting Army's upset into context (or, yep, it's pretty big)], D1Scourse, May 17, 2010.</ref><ref>Edward Lee, [http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/lacrosse/blog/2010/05/qa_with_espns_quint_kessenich_3.html Q&A with ESPN's Quint Kessenich], ''The Baltimore Sun'', May 18, 2010.</ref> It was Army's first tournament win since [[1993 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1993]] and just the second home playoff loss for Syracuse since the tournament's inception; the other occurred in the [[1991 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1991]] semifinals.<ref>[http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/17/mens-lacrosse-army-stuns-defending-champions-syracuse-advance-ncaa-quarterfinals Men's Lacrosse: Army stuns defending champions Syracuse to advance to NCAA quarterfinals], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 17, 2010.</ref>

===Quarterfinals===
Notre Dame pulled off a second straight upset over No. 3 Maryland 7-5 after ousting No. 6 Princeton in the first round. The Irish qualified for the semifinals for only the second time in school history. Their only other appearance came in 2001.<ref>[http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/22/mens-lacrosse-notre-dame-tops-maryland-7-5-advance-second-ever-ncaa-semifinals Men's Lacrosse: Notre Dame tops Maryland 7-5 to advance to second ever NCAA semifinals], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 22, 2010.</ref> Duke ran away with a 17-9 win over rival North Carolina after a 6-goal spurt in the second half.

In the first semifinal, Notre Dame once again used its stifling defense led by goalie Scott Rodgers to beat a third straight seeded opponent in No. 7 Cornell. The Irish led 6-3 at half time but two straight goals in the third quarter pulled Cornell to within two at 7-5. It was as close as the Big Red would get, however, as the Irish finished with a flurry to win 12-7. The win marked the first time that an unseeded team had reached the championship game since [[UMass Minutemen men's lacrosse|UMass]] in 2006. It also marked the first time in school history that Notre Dame advanced to the title game.

In the second semifinal, No. 5 Duke upset No. 1 Virginia. After leading 7-5 at halftime, Virginia scored first in the second half to take an 8-5 lead, but Duke responded with a seven-goal blitz that made it 12-8 in favor of the Blue Devils early in the fourth quarter. Virginia would not go quietly, however, as the Cavaliers tied the game at 13 with just over a minute to play. With just 12 seconds left, Duke scored with the familiar combination of Ned Crotty to Max Quinzani to send Duke to its third championship game in six years.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5232692 Notre Dame to face Duke in final], ''ESPN'', May 30, 2010.</ref>

The championship game featured two schools who had never won a national title before, the first time that had happened since [[1973 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1973]]. This guaranteed that a first-time Division I lacrosse champion would be crowned, something that had not happened since Princeton in [[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1992]].<ref>[http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/29/duke-notre-dame-roll-toward-a-historic-title-game Duke, Notre Dame roll toward a historic title game], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 29, 2010.</ref> The game proved to be one of the closest championship contests ever, albeit the lowest scoring one as well. Neither team ever led by more than a single goal throughout the contest. After trailing 3-2 at halftime, Notre Dame took its first lead since the first minute of the game early in the fourth quarter. Duke tied the game a few minutes later, though, and had a chance to win in the final seconds of regulation, but stellar defense by Notre Dame and timely saves by tournament MVP Scott Rodgers sent the game to overtime. The slow pace of regulation did not continue into overtime, as Duke Sophomore CJ Costabile, a long stick midfielder, won the opening faceoff cleanly and sprinted straight downfield to score just 5 seconds into the extra period. The goal set the record for the fastest to start an overtime in NCAA championship history, and gave Duke its first national title in school history.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5236683 Duke edges Irish for first lacrosse title], ''ESPN'', May 31, 2010.</ref>

==Post-tournament honors==
After the championship, Duke attackman Ned Crotty was honored with the [[Tewaaraton Trophy]] for the most outstanding Division I men's lacrosse player.<ref>[http://www.goduke.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=4200&ATCLID=204954915 Crotty Captures 2010 Tewaaraton Trophy], ''Go Duke'', June 3, 2010.</ref> The NCAA announced the All-Tournament team after the championship. Scott Rodgers, goalie for runner-up Notre Dame, was named the Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. The full team included four players from champion Duke, three from runner-up Notre Dame, two from semifinalist Virginia, and one from semifinalist Cornell. The following individuals were named to that team:<ref>[http://insidelacrosse.com/news/2010/05/31/mens-lacrosse-2010-ncaa-all-tournament-team-announced Men's Lacrosse: 2010 NCAA All-Tournament Team Announced], ''Inside Lacrosse'', May 31, 2010.</ref>
