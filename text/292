"'''Irreplaceable'''" is a song written by [[United States|American]] singer-songwriters [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]], and [[Norway|Norwegian]] songwriters Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, [[Espen Lind]], and Amund Bj<U+00F8>rklund for Knowles' second studio album ''[[B<U+2019>Day]]''. Produced by Norwegian production team [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and Beyonc<U+00E9>, the song was released as the album's third [[single (music)|single]] domestically, and the second single outside North America in October 2006. "Irreplaceable" reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on [[December 16]], [[2006]], making it Beyonc<U+00E9>'s eighth ''Billboard'' number-one, and her fourth as a solo artist (her first without a guest rapper). It has sold over two million copies in digital sales.<ref name=B>{{Fact|http://pulsemusic.proboards48.com/index.cgi?board=gmn&action=display&thread=1183848940&page=2}}</ref> It was the last U.S. #1 of 2006 and the first of 2007.

"Irreplaceable" was the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single for ten weeks, and has received world wide critical acclaim. In the United States, it has become the most successful song of her solo career. In December of 2006, a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] version of "Irreplaceable" entitled "Irreemplazable" (which means "Irreplaceable") was released. This remix has peaked on #4 on Billboard's [[Hot Latin Songs]]. It has also been faring fairly well on charts in Latin countries and will be included in her [[Spanish language]] re-release of ''[[B'Day]]''.
In the UK the song was used, along with Beyonce, in TV commercials for the Samsung Ultra Music SGH-F300 cell-phone.

==Writing and inspiration==
What started this song was a musical idea. Stargate Produced the track, using acoustic guitar parts made by  Espen Lind and Amund Bj<U+00F8>rklund, and then making it into a full track with drums, bass and strings. This beat was presented to Ne-Yo who loved the idea, and wrote lyrics and melody on the spot. The song was then played to Beyonce<U+00B4> and she recorded the song for her B<U+00B4>Day album.

According to Beyonc<U+00E9>, "Irreplaceable" is meant to empower her female fans by encouraging them to end bad relationships: "[Irreplaceable] is a secret weapon...It's a celebration of a breakup and makes women feel like they're worth more."<ref name=B>{{cite web | title=PR Inside| work= Beyonc<U+00E9> Creates Break-up Anthem| url=http://www.pr-inside.com/beyonce-creates-breakup-anthem-r35598.htm| accessdate= December 31|accessyear=2006}}</ref>

==Music and structure==
"Irreplaceable" is an R&B song written in the key of [[B flat major|B<U+266D> major]].<ref name="sheet">Sheet music for "Irreplaceable".  Sony/ATV Music Publishing.  2005.</ref>  It is written in [[time signature|common time]] and moves at a moderate 100 [[beats per minute]].<ref name="sheet"/>  Knowles' [[vocal range]] spans nearly an octave and a half, from B<U+266D><sub>3</sub> to E<U+266D><sub>5</sub>.<ref name="sheet"/>

==Critical reception==
The song was well-received by critics. While many of the tracks from ''B<U+2019>Day'' have been upbeat club-bangers, featuring heavy [[Roland TR-808|808]]-driven beats, "Irreplaceable" has been praised by critics for its simple, guitar-driven melody. Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] gave the song four and a half stars, and characterized it as "one of the strongest" tracks from the album. He praised  [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] for the "simple, pop-oriented production" and the "subject matter of female strength and independence."<ref>{{cite web | title=About.com| work= Single Review: Irreplaceable| url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/irreplaceable.htm| accessdate= December 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Lamb ranked "Irreplaceable" the fourth best R&B song of 2006.<ref>{{cite web | title=About.com| work=Top 10 R&B Songs of 2006| url=http://randb.about.com/od/top5lists/tp/2006TopSingles.htm| accessdate= December 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Barry Schwartz of ''[[Stylus Magazine|Stylus]]'' Magazine wrote that "[Irreplaceable] recaptured "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Crazy in Love]]"<U+2019>s near-perfection....[and features] her most genuinely emotional vocal to date, equal parts vulnerable, upset, pissed off, vindictive, resigned, and apathetic."<ref>{{cite web | title=Stylus Magazine| work= Top 50 Singles of 2006| url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/weekly_article/stylus-magazines-top-50-singles-of-2006.htm| accessdate= December 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> 

For ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Jody Rosen said the track was "a lilting tune unlike anything Beyonc<U+00E9> has ever performed,"<ref>{{cite web | title=Entertainment Weekly| work= Album Review: B<U+2019>Day| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,1516025_4_0_,00.html| accessdate= December 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> while ''[[Billboard]]'' magazine praised "Irreplaceable"'s simplicity and 'radio-friendliness,' noting that the "song dilutes the excessive instrumentation of B's first two singles in favor of smooth drum taps and guitar strumming" and "should blast off at radio."<ref>{{cite web | title=Billboard.com| work=Single Review: Irreplaceable| url=http://music.monstersandcritics.com/reviews/article_1219456.php| accessdate= December 28|accessyear=2006}}</ref> In their review of ''B'Day'', the popular [[Indie (music)|indie]]-oriented website [[Pitchfork Media]] declared "Irreplaceable" the album's best song, calling it "(Beyonc<U+00E9>'s) most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date".<ref>{{cite web | title=Pitchfork Media| work= Review: Beyonc<U+00E9> - B'Day| url=http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38328/Beyonc%C3%A9_BDay| accessdate= January 24|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Irreplaceable won the [[Soul Train Music Award]] for "Best R&B/Hip-Hop Single, Female," and the Nickelodeon [[Kid's Choice Award]] for "Favorite Song".

==Chart performance==
"Irreplaceable" has entered various charts around the world, and has become the most successful single from ''B<U+2019>Day''. The single debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on the issue dated [[November 4]], [[2006]] at position eighty-seven, and climbed the charts rapidly because of heavy airplay&mdash; it received the "Greatest Airplay Gainer" certification for seven weeks, six of which were consecutive. It also received the "Greatest Sales Gainer" for three consecutive weeks. It summited the Hot 100 on [[December 16]], [[2006]], making the song Beyonc<U+00E9>'s fourth number one single, and her second in 2006, following [[Check On It]] (featuring [[Slim Thug]]). On the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, the song debuted at position forty-two on which it became her fourth number one single. "Irreplaceable" also became a belated favorite on [[adult contemporary]] radio stations, becoming the first AC chart hit of Beyonce's solo career (she made the AC chart with Destiny's Child once, with the trio's remake of "[[Emotion (song)|Emotion]]" in 2001).

Much of the song's success depended on its considerable airplay. On [[December 11]] [[2006]], following "Check on It," "Irreplaceable" passed the 200 million [[audience impression]]s mark in the United States, according to [[Mediabase]]. This achievement makes Beyonc<U+00E9> one of the only artists to have two songs pass the 200 million impression mark in a single year; the only other artist to achieve this is [[Mariah Carey]], when in [[2005]] "[[We Belong Together]]" and "[[Shake It Off]]" passed the 200 million mark. "Irreplaceable" had major cross-over success, becoming the first song to simultaneously occupy the number-one position on twelve ''Billboard'' charts on the week ending [[December 30]] [[2006]]: the Hot 100, [[Hot 100 Airplay]], Hot 100 Single Sales Chart, [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]], [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay]], Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles Sales Chart, [[Pop 100]], [[Pop 100 Airplay]], the Mainstream Top 40, Rhythmic Top 40, [[Hot Digital Songs]], and the [[Hot Digital Tracks]] charts.  "Irreplaceable" has also the best audience week of Beyonc<U+00E9>'s career and the second-best sum in the chart's history, with 196.3 radio impressions. Only Mariah Carey's "We Belong Together" has bested that total; it garnered 223 million impressions during a week in July 15, 2005.<ref>{{cite web | title=USA Today| work= Carey sets a record| url=http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20050713/d_toplline13.art.htm| accessdate=February 14| accessyear=2006}}</ref>

Internationally, the song has experienced major success as well. It reached number one on the Ariplay Eurochart (based on airplay charts form 17 countries) in January 2007. In the U.K, despite reaching a peak of #4 Irreplaceable became her longest running top 40 single. With sales of 206,000 copies it is her third most successful  single in the U.K. only behind Crazy In Love and Beautiful Liar. On the Irish Singles chart, the song peaked at number one in its second week, making it her second Irish number one after "[[Crazy in Love (song)|Crazy in Love]]". In New Zealand the song jumped to number one during its sixth week on the charts, making the single Beyonc<U+00E9>'s second number one, after "[[Check on It]]" reached number one in early 2006. In Australia, "Irreplaceable" debuted at number eight on the singles chart and has now reached number one on the chart on [[December 31]], becoming her first number one single in Australia and has remained at the top for three consecutive weeks,going Platinum. As of February 2007  the single has sold over 1.900.000 copies in digital downloads and a further 180,000 across various other formats in the United States alone. Irreplaceable sold 267,000 copies in digital download in a week of January 2007, beating [[Shakira]]'s [[Hips Don't Lie]] in June 2006 with 265,000. But, also in January 2007, [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]'s [[Fergalicious]] beating her record, with 295,000 in a single week. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} "Irreplaceable" is the most successful single of 2006 on the Billboard Hot 100 staying at number one for ten weeks, three weeks more than [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[SexyBack]]". Overall, it has had the longest run at number one on the Hot 100 since [[Kanye West]] and [[Jamie Foxx]] held the summit for ten weeks with their single "[[Gold Digger]]" in 2005. The song has also surpassed Beyonce's "Baby Boy" to become her most successful single on the Hot 100 as a solo artist.
