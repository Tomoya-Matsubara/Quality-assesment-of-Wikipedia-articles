'''Sydney Cecil Newman''', [[Order of Canada|OC]] (April 1, 1917 <U+2013> October 30, 1997) was a Canadian film and television producer, who played a pioneering role in British television drama from the late 1950s to the late 1960s. After his return to Canada in 1970, Newman was appointed Acting Director of the Broadcast Programs Branch for the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|Canadian Radio and Television Commission]] (CRTC) and then head of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB). He also occupied senior positions at the [[Telefilm Canada|Canadian Film Development Corporation]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] and acted as an advisor to the [[Secretary of State for Canada]].<ref name="profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/sydney_newman/|title=Sydney Newman|work=NFB Profiles|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref>

During his time in Britain in the 1950s and 60s, he worked first with the [[Associated British Corporation]] (ABC) before moving across to the [[BBC]] in 1962, holding the role of Head of Drama with both organisations. During this phase of his career he was responsible for initiating two hugely popular fantasy series, ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'', as well as overseeing the production of groundbreaking [[Social Realism|social realist]] drama series such as ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'' and ''[[The Wednesday Play]]''.

The website of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] describes Newman as "the most significant agent in the development of British television drama".<ref name="mbc01">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/N/htmlN/newmansydne/newmansydne.htm|title=Newman, Sydney|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|first=Jason|last=Jacobs|accessdate=January 22, 2006}}</ref> Shortly after his death, his obituary in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper declared that "For ten brief but glorious years, Sydney Newman&nbsp;... was the most important [[impresario]] in Britain&nbsp;...

==Early career in Canada==
===Early life and the NFB===
Born in Toronto, Newman was the son of a Russian immigrant father who ran a shoe shop.<ref name="obit01"/> After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the [[Central Technical School]], studying art and design subjects.<ref name="obit01"/><ref name="screenonline"/> He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters.<ref name="obit01" /> However, he found it difficult to earn enough money to make a living from this profession, so instead he switched to working in the film industry itself.<ref name="obit01"/> In 1938 he travelled to [[Hollywood]], where he was offered a role with the [[Walt Disney Company]] on the strength of his graphic design work.<ref name="screenonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/522017/|title=Newman, Sydney (1917<U+2013>1997)|first=Tise|last=Vahimagi|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a [[work permit]].<ref name="timesobit">{{cite news|title=Sydney Newman: Obituary|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=25|date=November 1, 1997}}</ref> Returning to his native country, in 1941 he gained a job as a [[film editor]] at the [[National Film Board of Canada]].<ref name="screenonline"/> He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.<ref name="obit01" />

During the Second World War the head of the NFB, [[John Grierson]], promoted Newman to film producer, working on documentaries and [[propaganda film]]s, including ''[[Fighting Norway]]'', which he directed.<ref name="screenonline"/> In 1944 he was made [[executive producer]] of ''[[Canada Carries On]]'', a long-running series of such films.<ref name="screenonline"/> In 1949 Grierson again assisted Newman's career, entering him into the then-new television industry on a one-year attachment to [[NBC]] television in New York City.<ref name="obit01" /> His assignment there was to compile reports for the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] on American television techniques, focusing on dramas, documentaries and [[outside broadcast]]s.<ref name="screenonline"/>

===CBC Television===
One of Newman's reports on [[outside broadcasting]] was seen and admired by executives at the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC),<ref name="miller">{{cite book|title=Rewind and Search: Conversations With the Makers and Decision-Makers of CBC Television Drama|first=Mary Jane|last=Miller|page=45|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HzwvlHQ7jrAC&pg=PA45|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|year=1996|chapter=2 <U+2013> Producing|ISBN=0773513655}}</ref> and in 1952 he joined the Corporation as their Supervising Director of Features, Documentaries and Outside Broadcasts.<ref name="screenonline"/> There he was involved in producing some of the earliest television editions of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'',<ref name="miller"/><ref name="torontoist">{{cite web|url=http://torontoist.com/2009/07/historicist_the_adventures_of_sydney_newman_1.php|title=Historicist: The Adventures of Sydney Newman|first=Jamie|last=Bradburn|publisher=Torontoist.com|date=July 11, 2009|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> and the first [[Canadian Football League]] game to be shown on television.<ref name="cfl">{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.php?url=http%3A//www.broadcasting-history.ca/sportsonradioandtv/CFL_The_TV_Years.html|title=CFL <U+2013> The Television Years|first=Paul|last=Patskou|publisher=[[Canadian Communications Foundation]]|date=August 2007|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> After his experience of seeing the production of television plays in New York, he was eager to work in drama despite by his own admission "knowing nothing about drama".<ref name="obit01" /> He was nonetheless able to persuade his superiors at CBC to make him Supervisor of Drama Production in 1954.<ref name="miller"/> In this position he encouraged a new wave of young writers and directors, including [[William Kotcheff]] and [[Arthur Hailey]], and oversaw shows such as the popular ''[[General Motors Theatre]]''.<ref name="screenonline"/>

Writing in 1990, the journalist Paul Rutherford felt that during his time at the CBC in the 1950s, Newman had been a "great champion of both realistic and Canadian drama".<ref name="rutherford">{{cite book|title=When Television Was Young: Primetime Canada 1952<U+2013>1967|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mnWfAKizTTAC&pg=PA281|first=Paul|last=Rutherford|chapter=Culture on the Small Screen|year=1990|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|page=281|isbn=080206647X}}</ref> He felt that Newman "came to fulfil the role of the drama impresario with the vision to push people to develop a high-quality and popular style of drama."<ref name="rutherford"/>

Several of the ''General Motors Theatre'' plays, including Hailey's ''[[Flight into Danger]]'', were purchased for screening by the BBC in the United Kingdom.<ref name="screenonline"/> The productions impressed [[Howard Thomas]], who was the managing director of [[Associated British Corporation]] (ABC), the franchise holder for the rival [[ITV]] network in the [[English Midlands]] and the [[North of England|North]] at weekends. Thomas offered Newman a job with ABC as a producer of his own Saturday night [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] series, which Newman accepted, moving to Britain in 1958.<ref name="obit01" /> In 1975, the then-Head of Drama at the CBC, John Hirsch, noted that the fact that so many writers and directors followed Newman to the UK in the 1950s and never returned to work in Canada had made a detrimental impact on the standard of subsequent Canadian television drama.<ref>{{cite news|title=Viewers Should Tell CBC What They Like: Hirsch|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MDk0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=ifUIAAAAIBAJ&pg=1735,2859100|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|page=2|first=James|last=Nelson|date=April 7, 1975}}</ref>

The building sits on the corner of a street, and is seen in bright, sunny weather.|ABC's studios in [[Didsbury]], [[Manchester]], where Newman pioneered ''[[Armchair Theatre]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'']]
Soon after Newman arrived in the UK, ABC's Head of Drama [[Dennis Vance]] was moved into a more senior position with the company, and Thomas offered Newman his position, which the Canadian quickly accepted.<ref name="obit01"/> He was, however, somewhat disparaging of the state in which he found British television drama. "At that time, I found this country to be somewhat class-ridden," he reminisced to interviewers in 1988. "The only legitimate theatre was of the 'anyone for tennis' variety, which on the whole gave a condescending view of working-class people. Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays and invariably about the upper classes. I said 'Damn the upper classes: they don't even ''own'' televisions!'"<ref name="dwm">{{cite journal|title=Chaos and Creation in the Junkyard|first=Benjamin|last=Cook|authorlink=Benjamin Cook|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Special Edition|series=In Their Own Words|issue=12|date=January 12, 2006|page=5|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]}}</ref>

Newman's principal tool for shaking up this established order was a programme which had been initiated before he had arrived at ABC, ''[[Armchair Theatre]]''.<ref name="mbc01"/> This anthology series was networked nationally across the ITV regions on Sunday evenings, and in 1959 was in the top ten of the ratings for 32 out of the 37 weeks it was broadcast, with audiences of over {{Nowrap|12 million}} viewers.<ref name="timesobit"/> Newman used the strand to present plays by writers such as [[Alun Owen]], [[Harold Pinter]] and [[Clive Exton]], also bringing over associates from Canada such as William Kotcheff.<ref name="mbc01"/> Writing in 2000, the television historian [[John Caughie]] stated that "Newman's insistence that the series would use only original material written for television made ''Armchair Theatre'' a decisive moment in the history of British television drama."<ref name="caughie">{{cite book|title=Television Drama: Realism, Modernism, and British Culture|first=John|last=Caughie|authorlink=John Caughie|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2000|pages=74<U+2013>75|isbn=0198742185}}</ref>

In 1960 Newman devised a thriller series for ABC called ''[[Police Surgeon (UK)|Police Surgeon]]'', starring [[Ian Hendry]].<ref name="surgeon">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/550338/index.html|title=Police Surgeon (1960)|first=Anthony|last=Clark|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> Although ''Police Surgeon'' was not a success and was cancelled after only a short run,<ref name="surgeon"/> Newman took Hendry as the star and some of the ethos of the programme to create a new series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name="avengers1">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/473728/index.html|title=Avengers, The (1961<U+2013>69)|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|first=Anthony|last=Clark|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> Debuting in January 1961, ''The Avengers'' became an international success,<ref name="avengers2">{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=avengersthe|title=The Avengers|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|first=Moya|last=Luckett|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.<ref name="avengers1"/>

Newman's great success at ABC had been noted by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], whose executives were keen to revive their own [[BBC television drama|drama department]]'s fortunes in the face of fierce competition from ITV.<ref name="timesobit"/> In 1961 the BBC's Director of Television, [[Kenneth Adam]], met with Newman and offered him the position of Head of Drama at the BBC.<ref name="obit01" /> He accepted the position, eager for a new challenge, although he was forced by ABC to remain with them until the expiration of his contract in December 1962, after which he immediately began work with the BBC.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker; p. 162 and p. 164</ref>

==BBC==
===Arrival and impact===
There was some initial resentment to his appointment within the Corporation, as he was an outsider and he was also earning more than many of the executives senior to him, although still substantially less than he had been paid at ABC.<ref name="obit01" /> As he had done at ABC, he was keen to shake up the staid image of BBC drama and introduce new outlets for the [[kitchen sink drama]] and the "[[Angry Young Men]]" of the era. He also divided the drama department into three separate divisions<U+2014>series, serials and plays,<ref name="indyobit">{{cite news|first=Leonard|last=Miall|authorlink=Leonard Miall|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=November 4, 1997|page=22|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-sydney-newman-1292055.html|title=Obituary: Sydney Newman|accessdate=January 25, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> headed by [[Elwyn Jones (writer)|Elwyn Jones]], [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and [[Michael Bakewell]], respectively, each reporting directly to Newman.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In 1964 he and Kenneth Adam initiated the new anthology series ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', a BBC equivalent of ''Armchair Theatre'', which had great success and critical acclaim with plays written and directed by the likes of [[Dennis Potter]], [[Jeremy Sandford]] and [[Ken Loach]].<ref name="weds">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454700/index.html|title=Wednesday Play, The (1964<U+2013>70)|first=Oliver|last=Wake|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> The strand attracted comment and debate for several of its productions, such as ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'', a [[Tony Garnett]] production of a Jeremy Sandford script, tackling the issue of homelessness.<ref name="weds"/> There were also problems caused by Newman bringing in freelance directors to work on the programme, who sometimes overspent on their plays to try and increase their impact; with staff directors this could be compensated by reducing the budget of a subsequent production, but for a freelancer there would be no such recourse.<ref name="indyobit"/>

[[Shaun Sutton]] was one of the drama producers who worked under Newman at the BBC, and later succeeded the Canadian as Head of Drama. He later wrote that Newman "galvanised television drama&nbsp;... [He created] a climate in which boldness paid."<ref name="sutton01">{{cite book|title=The Largest Theatre in the World <U+2013> Thirty Years of Television Drama|first=Shaun|last=Sutton|authorlink=Shaun Sutton|pages=18<U+2013>19|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|year=1982|isbn=0563200111}}</ref> In contrast, [[Don Taylor (director)|Don Taylor]], who was a director in the drama department at the time, later claimed that he felt Newman was unsuited to the position of Head of Drama, writing: "To put it brutally, I was deeply offended that the premier position in television drama, at a time when it really was the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] of the Air, had been given to a man whose values were entirely commercial, and who had no more than a layman's knowledge of the English theatrical tradition, let alone the drama of Europe and the wider world."<ref name="taylor01">{{cite book|title=Days of Vision <U+2013> Working with David Mercer: Television Drama Then and Now|first=Don|last=Taylor|authorlink=Don Taylor (director)|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing]]|year=1990|pages=185<U+2013>86|isbn=0413615103}}</ref>

Newman's biography at the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] website points out that much of the work Newman is credited for at the BBC was little different to that which had been undertaken by his predecessor [[Michael Barry (television producer)|Michael Barry]], who "also attracted new young original writers&nbsp;... and hired young directors&nbsp;... However, it was the newness and innovation which Newman encouraged in his drama output that is most significant: his concentration on the potential of television as television, for a mass not a middlebrow audience."<ref name="mbc01" /> The academic Madeleine Macmurraugh-Kavanagh has criticised some of the eulogistic views of Newman's time at the BBC, writing that: "When archive and press material emanating from the 1964<U+2013>65 period is examined, an interesting gap appears between what Newman seemed likely to accomplish and what he finally did accomplish&nbsp;... Also relevant to the mythology that has sprung up around Newman is the fact that his favoured dramatic material was interpreted by some as being rather less radical than it seemed."<ref>{{cite book|title=Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RxBJC2U5oRoC&pg=PA155|first=Madeleine|last=Macmurraugh-Kavanagh|pages=155<U+2013>56|chapter=9 <U+2013> The BBC and the Birth of The Wednesday Play, 1962<U+2013>66|editor-first=Janet|editor-last=Thumim|publisher=[[I.

===''Doctor Who''===
In 1963 he initiated the creation of the [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which ran until 1989 in its original form, and after a resumption in 2005 is still in production.<ref name="drwho1">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/454592/|title=Doctor Who (1963<U+2013>89, 2005<U+2013>)|first=Anthony|last=Clark|publisher=[[Screenonline]]|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> The series has been described by the [[British Film Institute]] as having "created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme",<ref name="drwho1"/> and by ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as "quintessential to being British".<ref name="drwho2">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1989181.ece|title=Doctor Who is simply masterful|first=Caitlin|last=Moran|newspaper=[[The Times]]|page=4|date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=January 26, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: "[U]p to the age of 40, I don't think there was a science-fiction book I hadn't read. I love them because they're a marvellous way<U+2014>and a ''safe'' way, I might add<U+2014>of saying nasty things about our own society."<ref name="dwm" />

When BBC Controller of Programmes [[Donald Baverstock]] alerted Newman of the need for a programme to bridge the gap between the sports showcase ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]'' and pop music programme ''[[Juke Box Jury]]'' on Saturday evenings, he decided that a science-fiction drama would be the perfect vehicle for filling the gap and gaining a family audience.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker; p. 166</ref> Although much work on the genesis of the series was done by Donald Wilson, [[C. E. Webber]] and others, it was Newman who created the idea of [[TARDIS|a time machine larger on the inside than the out]] and the character of the mysterious "[[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]", which remain at the heart of the programme.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker; pp. 171<U+2013>72</ref> He is also believed to have come up with the title ''Doctor Who'', although actor and director [[Hugh David]] later credited this to his friend [[Rex Tucker]], the initial "caretaker producer" of the programme.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker; p. 173</ref>

After the series had been conceptualised, Newman initially approached [[Don Taylor (director)|Don Taylor]]<ref name="dawn of knowledge">{{cite journal|last=Hearn|first=Marcus|title=The Dawn of Knowledge|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|issue=207|pages=8<U+2013>18|publisher=[[Marvel UK]]|date=December 22, 1993}}</ref> and then [[Shaun Sutton]]<ref name="dwm2">{{cite journal|first= Marcus |last= Hearn |date=January 14, 1998 |title=A Cross Between Genghis Khan and a Pussy Cat |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|issue=260 |pages=26<U+2013>31}}</ref> to produce it, although both declined. He then decided on his former [[production assistant]] at ABC, [[Verity Lambert]], who had never produced, written or directed but readily accepted his offer. As Lambert became the youngest<U+2014>and only female<U+2014>drama producer at the BBC,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Peter|title=Maiden Voyage|journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]|issue=234|pages=4<U+2013>9|publisher=[[Marvel UK]]|date=January 17, 1996}}</ref> there were some doubts as to Newman's choice, but she became a success in the role. Even Newman clashed with her on occasion, however, particularly over the inclusion of the alien [[Dalek]] creatures on the programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article3196286.ece|title=Verity Lambert|first=Anthony|last=Hayward|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=November 26, 2007|accessdate=January 26, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Newman had not wanted any "[[bug-eyed monster]]s" in the show,<ref name="bems">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/verity-lambert-tribute/|title=

In the 2007 ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]", the Doctor (in human form as "John Smith") refers to his parents Sydney and Verity, a tribute to both Newman and Lambert.<ref name="nature">{{cite episode|title=Human Nature|series=Doctor Who|serieslink=Doctor Who|credits=Writer <U+2013> [[Paul Cornell]]; Producer <U+2013> [[Susie Liggat]]; Director <U+2013> [[Charles Palmer (director)|Charles Palmer]]|network=BBC One|city=[[Cardiff]]|airdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> Verity Newman, a character in  "[[The End of Time]]" is also named after him.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/article2338914.ece | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Jen | last=Blackburn | title=Evans Whos after a Doctor | date=March 25, 2009}}</ref> A similar tip of the hat had appeared in the show's original run: In "The Powerful Enemy", the first episode of the 1965 story "[[The Rescue (Doctor Who)|The Rescue]]", in order to hide the fact that the apparent villain Koquillion is actually another character in disguise, the role is credited to the non-existent actor "Sydney Wilson", an amalgram of the names of Sydney Newman and Donald Wilson.

===Other work and departure===
Newman also had success with more traditional BBC fare such as the [[costume drama]] ''[[The Forsyte Saga (1967 series)|The Forsyte Saga]]'' in 1967, a Donald Wilson project on which Newman had not initially been keen.<ref name="timesobit"/> However, it became one of the most acclaimed and popular productions of his era,<ref name="screenonline"/> watched by {{Nowrap|100 million}} people in 26 countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3575198/Granadas-grand-undertaking.html|title=Granada's Grand Undertaking|first=Sarah|last=Crompton|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=March 27, 2002|accessdate=January 26, 2010 | location=London}}</ref> After also initiating other popular series such as ''[[Adam Adamant Lives!]]'',<ref name="screenonline"/> at the end of 1967 Newman's five-year contract with the BBC came to an end, and he did not remain with the Corporation.<ref name="indyobit"/> Instead, he returned to the film industry, taking a job as a producer with [[Associated British Picture Corporation]]. "I want to get away from my executive's chair and become a creative worker again," he told ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' newspaper of his decision.<ref name="dwm2"/>

However, the British film industry was entering a period of decline, and none of Newman's projects ever went into production. ABPC was taken over by [[EMI]], becoming [[EMI Films]], and at the end of June 1969, Newman was dismissed from the company, later describing his eighteen months there as "a futile waste".<ref name="obit01" /> Despite being offered an [[executive producer]]ship by the BBC, keen to regain his services on the very day he left ABPC,<ref name="dwm2" /> Newman decided to return to Canada. He left the UK on January 3, 1970, leading ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' to comment that "British television will never be the same again."<ref name="dwm2" />

==Return to Canada==
===Chairman of the NFB===
His first post upon returning to his home country was an advisory position with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|Canadian Radio and Television Commission]] (CRTC) in [[Ottawa]], where he battled Canada's private broadcasters, especially [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], over new [[Canadian content]] regulations.<ref name="torontoist"/> This lasted for only a few months, before in August 1970 he became the new Government Film Commissioner, the Chairman of the National Film Board of Canada, returning to the same institution for which he had worked in the 1940s.<ref name="torontoist"/> In this role, he experienced considerable problems in Quebec resulting from the fact that he did not speak French, at a time when the NFB's French Program branch was attracting young [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] filmmakers.<ref name="Evans"/><ref name="torontoist"/> Some staff members also felt that he had been away from the NFB for too long,<ref name="Evans"/> while the filmmaker [[Denys Arcand]] felt that Newman did not understand Quebec culture.<ref name="torontoist"/>

Newman was able to improve the NFB's relations with broadcaster CBC, securing prime time television slots for several productions,<ref name="torontoist"/> although he was criticised by some filmmakers for allowing the CBC to screen NFB films with commercial interruptions.<ref name="platley1">{{cite book|title=Torn Sprockets <U+2013> The Uncertain Projection of the Canadian Film|first=Gerald|last=Pratley|publisher=[[Associated University Presses]]|year=1987|page=107|chapter=8 <U+2013> A Turning Point|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k-d7P4BD-cQC&pg=PA107|isbn=0874131944}}</ref> He also moved the NFB entirely over to [[color film]] production.<ref name="torontoist"/> However, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'''s Martin Knelman felt that Newman was "mired in political warfare and administrative chaos".<ref name="filmref">{{cite web|url=http://filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=46&csid1=3530&navid=46|title=Sydney Newman|publisher=The Film Reference Library|first=Andrew|last=McIntosh|date=June 30, 2005|accessdate=January 25, 2010}}</ref> He was responsible for censoring or banning several productions, including Arcand's ''[[On est au coton]]''<ref name="filmref"/><ref name="spaas">{{cite book|title=The Francophone Film: A Struggle for Identity|first=Lieve|last=Spaas|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=suDmAWP6VzoC&pg=PA92|page=92|chapter=II <U+2013> North America and the Caribbean|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2000|ISBN=0719058619}}</ref> and [[Gilles Groulx]]'s ''24 heures ou plus''.<ref name="spaas"/> These films were concerned, respectively, with the conditions of textile factory workers and critiquing [[consumer society]].<ref name="spaas"/> Such censorship or banning resulted in some critics attacking Newman for being anti working-class<ref name="cine-tracts">{{cite book |last=Burnett| first=Ron|editor-first=Ron| editor-last=Burnett|title=Explorations in Film Theory <U+2013> Selected Essays From Cin<U+00E9>-Tracts |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=roCaWeTFAtIC&pg=PA115|year=1991 |page=115 |chapter=VIII: The Crisis of the Documentary Film in Quebec|isbn=0253312825}}</ref> and pro-capitalist.<ref name="spaas"/>

Newman had a mixed record with French-language films. He defended [[Pierre Perrault]]'s ''Un pays sans bon sens!'' to a committee of parliament in 1971,<ref name="scott">{{cite book|title=Screening Qu<U+00E9>bec|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GA-Lsk8HWz0C&pg=PA161|first=Scott|last=MacKenzie|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=2004|page=161|chapter=6 <U+2013> New technologies, new publics: class, gender, sexuality and social activism|isbn=0719063965}}</ref> but the same year personally rejected the release of [[Michel Brault]]'s film about the [[October Crisis]], ''[[Les ordres]]''.<ref name="scott"/> This was despite the fact that the film had already been approved by the board's French-language committee, and it was not eventually released until Brault personally released it in 1974.<ref name="scott"/>

Newman himself had been regarded as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled the headquarters of the NFB.<ref name="Evans"/> Newman was concerned about the idea of releasing films with [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] themes, such as Groulx's ''24 heures ou plus'', at such a tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nfb.tv/history/1970-1979/#year-1972|title=1972|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref> Although it was Newman's deputy [[Andr<U+00E9> Lamy]] who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nfb.tv/history/1970-1979/#year-1976|title=1976|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}</ref>

When Newman's contract with the NFB came to an end in 1975, it was not renewed.<ref name="torontoist"/> Film historian Gerald Pratley claims that by this point, the NFB was "an almost-forgotten institution" due to "the stupor that had overtaken it".<ref name="platley2">{{cite book|title=Torn Sprockets <U+2013> The Uncertain Projection of the Canadian Film|first=Gerald|last=Pratley|publisher=[[Associated University Presses]]|year=1987|chapter=9 <U+2013> Saving the Industry?|page=117|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k-d7P4BD-cQC&pg=PA117|isbn=0874131944}}</ref> The writer Richard Collins felt that "the very experiences that enabled [Newman] to recognize the nature of the NFB's problem and the need for a change of diction and reorientation to the tastes of Canadians had left him out of touch with Canada."<ref name="collins">{{cite book|title=Culture, Communication, and National Identity: The Case of Canadian Television|first=Richard|last=Collins|year=1990|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wStlj5UGrNYC&pg=PA213|chapter=7 <U+2013> The Intellectuals, Television, and Two Solitudes|page=213|isbn=0802067727}}</ref> For his part, Newman felt that the NFB's French program had not made enough effort to communicate with people in English Canada or to make films that were relevant to "the ordinary men, who have no particular axe to grind".<ref name="ferment">{{cite journal|title=Ferment at the National Film Board|journal=[[Cinema Canada]]|page=10|url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/25/101}}</ref>

Newman went on to become a Special Advisor on Film to the [[Secretary of State for Canada|Secretary of State]],<ref name="screenonline"/> and from 1978 until 1984 he was Chief Creative Consultant to the [[Telefilm Canada|Canadian Film Development Corporation]].<ref name="screenonline"/>

===Later years===
Newman was awarded the [[Order of Canada]] in 1981, the country's highest civilian honour.<ref name="indyobit"/> Shortly thereafter he returned to live in Britain again for some time following the death in 1981 of his wife Elizabeth McRae, to whom he had been married since 1944.<ref name="indyobit"/><ref name="odnb">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/68398|title=Newman, Sydney Cecil (1917<U+2013>1997)|first=Matthew|last=Kilburn|publisher=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|date=May 2006|accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> His main reason for going back to the UK was to attempt, unsuccessfully, to produce a drama series about the [[Bloomsbury Group]] for the new [[Channel 4]] network.<ref name="indyobit"/>

In 1986, the then Controller of BBC One, [[Michael Grade]], unhappy with the current state of ''Doctor Who'', wrote to Newman to enquire whether he had any ideas for reformatting the series, which was at the time struggling in the ratings. Newman wrote back to Grade on October 6 that year with a set of detailed proposals and a suggestion that he take direct control of the series as executive producer. Grade suggested that Newman meet the current Head of Drama, [[Jonathan Powell (producer)|Jonathan Powell]], for lunch to discuss the Canadian's ideas. Newman and Powell did not get on well, however, and nothing came of their meeting.<ref name="eighties">{{cite book|title=Doctor Who <U+2013> The Eighties|first1=David J.|last1=Howe|authorlink1=David J.

Acting Head of Series & Serials [[Ken Riddington]], to whom Newman's request had been referred, wrote to him that "Heads of Department who originate programmes have to be satisfied with the other rewards that flow from doing so."<ref name="eighties" />

Newman returned to Canada again in the 1990s, where he died of a heart attack in Toronto in 1997. He was survived by his three daughters,<ref name="indyobit"/> and by his new partner Marion McDougall.<ref name="odnb"/>
