The '''Calgary Hitmen''' are a [[junior ice hockey|Major Junior]] [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].  The Hitmen play in the [[Western Hockey League]] (WHL).  They play their home games at the [[Pengrowth Saddledome]].  Their name is derived from Calgary-born [[professional wrestling|wrestler]] [[Bret Hart|Bret "The Hitman" Hart]].  Established in 1994, the team has been owned by the [[Calgary Flames]] hockey club since 1997.  They are the third WHL team to represent Calgary, preceded by the [[Calgary Centennials|Centennials]] and [[Calgary Wranglers|Wranglers]].

The Hitmen have twice finished with the [[Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy|best record]] in the WHL, and have qualified for the playoffs every season since 1998.  In 1999, the Hitmen became the first Calgary team to win the [[Ed Chynoweth Cup|President's Cup]] as league champions, and the first to represent Calgary in the [[Memorial Cup]] since the [[Calgary Canadians]] won the national junior title in 1926.  The Hitmen hold numerous WHL attendance records, and in 2004<U+2013>05 became the first team in the [[Canadian Hockey League]] to average 10,000 fans per game.  Twenty-one former Hitmen players have gone on to play in the [[National Hockey League]].

==History==
[[Graham James]] left his position as coach and general manager of the [[Swift Current Broncos]] to found the Hitmen in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Tucker |title=Ice dreams |work=Calgary Sun |date=1995-10-24}}</ref> James organized a group of eighteen investors in the club, including star [[National Hockey League]] players [[Theoren Fleury]] and [[Joe Sakic]] along with [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] wrestler [[Bret Hart]].<ref name="SaleHerald">{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Board |title=Flames take a shot at owning Hitmen |work=Calgary Herald |page=E1-E2 |date=1997-06-14}}</ref>  The [[Calgary Flames]], who had just assumed control of the Olympic Saddledome (now [[Pengrowth Saddledome]]) and were looking to fill extra dates in the building, were receptive to the new team.<ref name="madness">{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Tucker |title=Method to this madness |page=62 |work=Calgary Sun |date=1994-06-24}}</ref>

Calgary had been without a WHL team since 1987, when the [[Calgary Wranglers]] moved south to become the [[Lethbridge Hurricanes]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=Hitmen home run |work=Calgary Sun |date=1995-10-07}}</ref>  The league's expansion into Calgary was met with skepticism, as the league had previously avoided Western Canada's largest markets of [[Vancouver]], [[Edmonton]], Calgary and [[Winnipeg]], because all previous teams there repeatedly failed in each market against the NHL.<ref name="madness" />

===Controversial beginnings===
[[Image:Hitmenlogos.GIF|thumb|250px|right|The controversial original logo of the Hitmen (left), as well as the alternate they chose to use in their first season (right)]]
The club selected its name and logo as an homage to Calgary's Bret "The Hitman" Hart. The team's distinctive pink, grey and black jerseys were also modeled after Hart's ring attire.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=It's the Hitmen! |work=Calgary Sun |page = 41 |date=1994-11-30}}</ref>  The logo proved immensely popular and Hitmen merchandise sold well at many local retailers.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=Fans can't get enough of Hitmen |work=Calgary Sun |page=37 |date=1995-01-11}}</ref>   However, the name and logo were subject to heavy criticism from segments of the public and the business community, who panned both as negative stereotypes of violence within the sport.<ref>{{cite news |first=George |last=Johnson |title=Hitmen under fire |work=Calgary Sun |page=40 |date=1994-12-13}}</ref> Among the chief critics of the new logo was the Flames organization, who argued that they had received calls from concerned business people, who agreed the name and logo brought up connotations of violence.<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Tucker |title='Hit' put on Hitmen |work=Calgary Sun |page=S3 |date=1995-01-14}}</ref>  Struggling to attract corporate sponsors, the Hitmen chose to scrap the "[[Jason Voorhees]]"-style logo in favour of an alternate "starburst" logo just two months after it was unveiled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=Hitmen logo nixed |work=Calgary Sun |page=51 |date=1995-01-16}}</ref> The club brought the original logo back in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070510232710/http://www.brethart.com/column/april30-2004.asp |title=Bret Hart's ''Calgary Sun'' column for April 30, 2004 |author = Hart, Bret |accessdate=2008-04-13 |date=2004-04-30 |work=Calgary Sun'' (via brethart.com)}}</ref>

The Hitmen entered their first season playing in the newly-formed Central Division, and were predicted to finish as high as third in the five-team division.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=And they're off<U+2026> |work=Calgary Sun |page = 61 |date=1995-10-07}}</ref>  Instead, they finished with the second-worst record in the league with an 18&ndash;51&ndash;3 record (18 wins, 51 losses and three ties).<ref>{{cite book |editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie |title=2007<U+2013>08 WHL Guide |publisher=Western Hockey League |pages=158}}</ref>  The Hitmen lost [[Canadian Dollar|CAD$]]250,000 in their first season and saw their season ticket base halved to 700 for the [[1996-97 WHL season|1996<U+2013>97 season]]. The losses lead to questions about the viability of the club.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Keyser |title=Growing pains |work=Calgary Herald |page=D3 |date=1996-09-21}}</ref>

Citing personal reasons, James resigned as coach and general manager on [[September 5]], [[1996]], stunning the organization.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Francis |title=Shocking departure |work=Calgary Sun |page=S6 |date=1996-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author1=Wildon, Suzanne |author2=Francis, eric |title=City police investigating former coach |work=Calgary Sun |page=4 |date=1996-09-07}}</ref> Two days later, the [[Calgary Police Service]] revealed that James was being investigated on allegations he [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] two former players while he was with the Swift Current Broncos.<ref>{{cite news |author=Wilton, Suzanne and Francis, Eric |title=City police investigating former coach |work=Calgary Sun |page=4 |date=1996-09-07}}</ref>  James was eventually charged, and in January 1997, James plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault.<ref>{{cite news |title= Ex-Coach Pleads Guilty |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E3D61439F937A35752C0A961958260 |work=The New York Times |date=1997-01-04 |accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>  Upon James' conviction, and sentencing to 3 1/2&nbsp;years in prison, the Hitmen attempted to distance themselves from their former coach.<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Deacon |title=Hockey Coach Guilty of Sexual Assault |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=M1ARTM0011058 |work=Macleans Magazine''(via The Canadian Encyclopedia) |date=1997-01-13|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>

The Hitmen struggled on the ice as well, again missing the playoffs after falling to a record of 15<U+2013>53<U+2013>4.<ref name="teamrecords">{{cite book |editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie |title=2007<U+2013>08 WHL Guide |publisher=Western Hockey League |pages=40<U+2013>41}}</ref>  The spectre of the Graham James scandal hurt the franchise.<ref name="SaleHerald" /> The original investors, many of whom played for or were otherwise associated with James, sold the team to the Flames for approximately $1.5&nbsp;million in June 1997.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Miller |title=Hitmen finally go up in Flames |work=Calgary Sun |page=S5 |date=1997-06-14}}</ref>  It was widely speculated that the new owners would change the team name, possibly to the ''Junior Flames''.

===WHL championship===

[[Dean Clark]] took over the club early the previous season as head coach, and led the [[1997-98 WHL season|1997<U+2013>98]] Hitmen to a remarkable turnaround.  The team improved to a 40<U+2013>28<U+2013>4 record and first place in the Central Division, and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.<ref name="teamrecords" /> In the playoffs, the Hitmen defeated the [[Saskatoon Blades]]  and [[Swift Current Broncos]] to reach the Eastern Conference final before falling to the [[Brandon Wheat Kings]].<ref>{{cite book |editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie |title=2007<U+2013>08 WHL Guide |publisher=Western Hockey League |pages=156}}</ref>  Clark was awarded the [[Dunc McCallum Memorial Trophy]] as WHL Coach of the Year as well as the [[Canadian Hockey League]]'s [[Brian Kilrea Coach of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whl.ca/records/?id=57 |title=WHL Coach of the Year - Dunc McCallum Memorial Trophy |accessdate=2008-03-21 |publisher=Western Hockey League}}</ref> Calgary improved to 51<U+2013>13<U+2013>8 in [[1998-99 WHL season|1998<U+2013>99]], finishing one point ahead of the [[Kamloops Blazers]] for the [[Scotty Munro Memorial Trophy|regular season title]].<ref name="98<U+2013>99">{{cite book |editor=Flett, Cory and Watts, Jessie |title=2007<U+2013>08 WHL Guide |publisher=Western Hockey League |pages=155}}</ref>  Led by [[Brad Moran (ice hockey)|Brad Moran]], [[Pavel Brendl]] and goaltender Alexandre Fomitchev, the Hitmen lost just five games in the playoffs en route to their first [[Ed Chynoweth Cup|President's Cup]], at home, before a WHL playoff record crowd of 17,139.<ref name="98<U+2013>99" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whl.ca/records/?id=43 |title=WHL team playoff records |accessdate=2008-03-21 |publisher=Western Hockey League}}</ref> The Hitmen became the first Calgary-based team to qualify for the [[Memorial Cup]] since the [[Calgary Canadians]] in [[1926 Memorial Cup|1926]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Randy |last=Sportak |title=Memorial Drive |work=Calgary Sun |page=S2 |date=1999-05-08}}</ref>
