The '''Arctic tern''' (''Sterna paradisaea'') is a [[seabird]] of the [[tern]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Sternidae]]. This [[bird]] has a [[:wiktionary:circumpolar|circumpolar]] breeding distribution covering the [[Arctic]] and sub-Arctic regions of [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[North America]] (as far south as [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]] and [[Massachusetts]]). The [[species]] is strongly [[bird migration|migratory]], seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast. Recent studies have shown average annual roundtrip lengths of about 70,900&nbsp;km (c. 44,300 miles) for birds nesting in [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]<ref name="Arctic terns' flying feat">{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60A4NV20100111|title=Arctic terns' flying feat|accessdate=20 January 2010|work=Reuters | date=11 January 2010}}</ref> and c. 90,000&nbsp;km (c. 55,900 miles) for birds nesting in the [[Netherlands]].<ref name="Dutch terns">Fijn, R.C.; Hiemstra, D.; Phillips, R.A.; van der Winden, J. (2013). 'Arctic Terns ''Sterna paradisaea'' from the Netherlands migrate record distances across three oceans to Wilkes Land, East Antarctica', ''ARDEA'', vol. 101, pp. 3-12 ([http://ardea.nou.nu/ardea_show_abstract.php?lang=uk&nr=4099 abstract]).</ref> These are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom. The Arctic Tern flies as well as glides through the air, performing almost all of its tasks in the air. It nests once every one to three years (depending on its mating cycle); once it has finished nesting it takes to the sky for another long southern migration.

Arctic Terns are medium-sized birds. They have a length of 33<U+2013>39&nbsp;cm (13<U+2013>15&nbsp;in) and a [[wingspan]] of 76<U+2013>85&nbsp;cm (26<U+2013>30&nbsp;in). They are mainly grey and white plumaged, with a red beak (as long as the head, straight, with pronounced [[wikt:gonys|gonys]]) and feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown (streaked white), and white cheeks. The grey mantle is 305&nbsp;mm, and the scapulae are fringed brown, some tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with grey outer webs. The hindcrown to the ear-coverts is black.

Arctic Terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching thirty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine [[invertebrate]]s. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.

== Distribution and migration ==
The Arctic Tern has a continuous worldwide circumpolar breeding distribution; there are no recognized [[subspecies]]. It can be found in coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]] during the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] summer. While wintering during the [[southern hemisphere|southern]] summer, it can be found at sea, reaching the northern edge of the Antarctic ice.<ref name="RSPB">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/birds/guide/a/arctictern/index.asp|author=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]|title=Arctic tern|accessdate=17 August 2006}}</ref>

The Arctic Tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year, the shortest distance between these areas being {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The long journey ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet.<ref name="Cramp">{{Cite book|title=[[Birds of the Western Palearctic]]|editor=S. Cramp|year=1985|pages=87<U+2013>100|isbn=0-19-857507-6}}</ref> One example of this bird's remarkable long-distance flying abilities involves an Arctic Tern [[bird ringing|ringed]] as an unfledged chick on the [[Farne Islands]], [[Northumberland]], UK, in the northern summer of 1982, which in October 1982, just three months from fledging, reached [[Melbourne]], Australia.

A 2010 study using tracking devices attached to the birds showed that the above examples are not unusual for the species. In fact, it turned out, previous research had seriously underestimated the annual distances travelled by the Arctic Tern. Eleven birds that bred in Greenland or Iceland covered {{convert|70,900|km|mi|abbr=on}}&nbsp; on average in a year, with a maximum of {{convert|81,600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The difference from previous estimates is due to the birds' taking meandering courses rather than following a straight route as was previously assumed. The birds follow a somewhat convoluted course in order to take advantage of prevailing winds.<ref name="Arctic terns' flying feat"/> The average Arctic Tern lives about twenty years, and will, based on the above research, travel some 2.4 million km (1.5 million mi) during its lifetime.

A 2013 tracking study of half a dozen Arctic Terns breeding in the [[Netherlands]]<ref name="Dutch terns" /> shows average annual migrations of c. {{convert|90,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. On their way south, these birds roughly followed the coastlines of [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].<ref name="BirdGuides">[http://www.birdguides.com/webzine/article.asp?a=3786 Dutch Arctic Terns migrating to Antarctica via Australia (BirdGuides.com)] (with map).</ref> Having rounded the southern tip of [[Africa]], they then turned east, some flying approximately halfway to [[Australia]] before again turning south to eventually reach [[Wilkes Land]] in the north-eastern [[Antarctic]]. One bird flew several hundred km along the south coast of [[Australia]] before turning south for the [[Antarctic]], while one flew along the entire south coast of [[Australia]], passing between [[Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. Having reached the [[Melbourne]] area, it turned south and flew in an arc to [[Wilkes Land]] in the north-east [[Antarctic]], passing the south-western tip of [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]] en route. Once back in the [[Netherlands]], this bird had journeyed c. {{convert|91,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the longest migration yet recorded for any animal.

Arctic Terns usually migrate sufficiently far offshore that they are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.<ref name="HBW">{{Cite book|editor1-last=Del Hoyo | editor1-first=Josep | editor2-last=Elliott  | editor2-first=Andrew | editor3-last=Sargatal | editor3-first=Jordi |title=[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]] vol. 3|year=1996|publisher=Lynx Edicions|pages=653|isbn=84-87334-20-2}}</ref>

== Description and taxonomy ==
[[File:Arctic Tern 2006 06 08.JPG|left|thumb|An Arctic Tern in [[Finland]]]]
The Arctic Tern is a medium-sized bird around 33<U+2013>36&nbsp;cm (13<U+2013>15&nbsp;in) from the tip of its beak to the tip of its tail. The wingspan is 76<U+2013>85&nbsp;cm.<ref name="HBW"/> The weight is 86<U+2013>127&nbsp;g (3.0<U+2013>4.5&nbsp;oz). The [[beak]] is dark red, as are the short legs and webbed feet. Like most terns, the Arctic Tern has [[bird flight|high aspect ratio wings]] and a tail with a deep fork.<ref name="HBW"/>

The adult [[plumage]] is grey above, with a black nape and crown and white cheeks. The upperwings are pale grey, with the area near the wingtip being translucent. The tail is white, and the underparts pale grey. Both sexes are similar in appearance. The winter plumage is similar, but the crown is whiter and the bills are darker.<ref name="HBW"/>

[[File:Havterne.jpg|right|thumb|An Arctic Tern in flight with wings spread]]

Juveniles differ from adults in their black bill and legs, "scaly" appearing wings, and mantle with dark feather tips, dark carpal wing bar, and short tail streamers.<ref name="HBW"/> During their first summer, juveniles also have a whiter forecrown.<ref name="National Geographic">{{Cite book|author=Steve N.G. Howell|author2=Alvaro Jaramillo|editor=Jonathan Alderfer|title=National Geographic Complete Birds of North America|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2006|pages=272<U+2013>73|isbn=0-7922-4175-4}}</ref>

The species has a variety of [[bird call|calls]]; the two most common being the ''alarm call'', made when possible predators (such as humans or other [[mammal]]s) enter the colonies, and the ''advertising call''.<ref name = "Hatch et al."/> The advertising call is social in nature, made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the [[bird song]] of [[passerine]]s, identifying individuals. Eight other calls have been described, from ''begging calls'' made by females during mating to ''attack calls'' made while swooping at intruders.

While the Arctic Tern is similar to the [[Common Tern|Common]] and [[Roseate Tern]]s, its colouring, profile, and call are slightly different. Compared to the Common Tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the Roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic Tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the Common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the Roseate.<ref name="Olsen">{{Cite book|title=Terns of Europe and North America|author=Klaus Malling Olson|author2=Hans Larsson|year=1995|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-7136-4056-1}}</ref>

This bird's closest relatives are a group of South Polar species, the [[South American Tern|South American]] (''Sterna hirundinacea''), [[Kerguelen Tern|Kerguelen]] (''S. virgata''), and [[Antarctic Tern|Antarctic]] (''S. vittata'') Terns.<ref name="Bridge et al.">

The immature plumages of Arctic Tern were originally described as separate species, ''Sterna portlandica'' and ''Sterna pikei''.<ref>[[Kaufman, Kenn]] (1990) Peterson Field Guides: Advanced Birding, ISBN 0-395-53517-4, Chapter 18, p. 135</ref>

After this, both birds will usually fly and circle each other.<ref name="Firefly p 268"/>

[[File:Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) chick.jpg|thumb|left|An Arctic Tern chick on the Farne Islands, Northumberland, England.]]
Both sexes agree on a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male continues to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this.<ref name="Firefly p 268"/> Breeding takes place in [[seabird colony|colonies]] on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on [[tundra]] near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the [[Common Tern]]. It lays from one to three [[egg (biology)|eggs]] per clutch, most often two.<ref name="HBW"/>

[[File:Arctic tern 8664.jpg|thumb|left|An Arctic Tern protecting nest near Markarfljot river in south Iceland.]]
It is one of the most aggressive terns, fiercely defensive of its nest and young. It will attack humans and large predators, usually striking the top or back of the head. Although it is too small to cause serious injury to an animal of a human's size, it is still capable of drawing blood, and is capable of repelling many raptorial birds and smaller mammalian predators such as foxes and cats.<ref name="Cramp"/> Other nesting birds, such as [[alcid]]s, often incidentally benefit from the protection provided by nesting in an area defended by Arctic Terns.

[[File:Arctic tern nest by Bruce McAdam.jpg|thumb|right|Arctic Tern nest with two eggs, at Thingvellir National Park, Iceland]]The nest is usually a depression in the ground, which may or may not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials.

== Ecology and behaviour ==
The diet of the Arctic Tern varies depending on location and time, but is usually [[carnivore|carnivorous]]. In most cases, it eats small [[fish]] or marine [[crustacean]]s.<ref name="RSPB"/><ref name="HBW"/> Fish species comprise the most important part of the diet, and account for more of the [[biomass]] consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1<U+2013>2-year old) shoaling species such as [[herring]], [[cod]], [[sandlance]]s, and [[capelin]].<ref name="Cramp"/> Among the marine crustaceans eaten are [[amphipod]]s, [[crab]]s and [[krill]]. Sometimes, these birds also eat [[mollusc]]s, marine worms, or [[berry|berries]], and on their northern breeding grounds, [[insect]]s.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

Arctic Terns sometimes dip down to the surface of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding.<ref name="Kaufman"/> It is also thought that Arctic Terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in [[kleptoparasitism]] by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches.<ref name="Kaufman"/> Several species are targeted<U+2014>conspecifics, other terns (like the Common Tern), and some [[auk]] and [[grebe]] species.<ref name="Hatch et al."/>

While nesting, Arctic Terns are vulnerable to predation by cats and other animals.<ref name="RSPB"/> Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger [[American Herring Gull|Herring Gull]] steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites.<ref name="Firefly p 269"/> While feeding, [[skua]]s, gulls, and other tern species will often harass the birds and steal their food.<ref name="Firefly p 271">[[#refPerrins|Perrins (2003)]], p. 271</ref> They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as [[Common Tern|Common]] and [[Sandwich Tern]]s.

== Conservation status ==
[[File:Kuestenseeschwalbe-Kniepsand.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up]]

Arctic Terns are considered threatened or species of concern in certain states. They are also among the species to which the ''[[AEWA|Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds]]'' applies.<ref name="AEWA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep-aewa.org/birds/index.cfm?species=20811|title=African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement Annex II: Species list|author=[[AEWA]]|accessdate=17 August 2006}}</ref> The species reduced population in [[New England]] in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade.<ref name="Hatch et al."/> Exploitation continues today in western [[Greenland]], where the population of the species has been reduced greatly since 1950.<ref name="Hansen">{{Cite journal|title=Threats to wildlife in Greenland|author=K. Hansen|year=2001|journal=Seabird Group Newsletter|volume =89|pages=1<U+2013>2}}</ref>

At the southern part of their range, the Arctic Tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food.<ref name="National Geographic"/> However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.<ref name="Kaufman"/>

Birdlife International has considered the species to be at lower risk since 1988, believing that there are approximately one million individuals around the world.<ref name="Birdlife International"/>

== Cultural depictions ==
The Arctic Tern has appeared on the [[postage stamps]] of several countries and dependent territories. The territories include the [[<U+00C5>land Islands]], [[Alderney]], and [[Faroe Islands]].
