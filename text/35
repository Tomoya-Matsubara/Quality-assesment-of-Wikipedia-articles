{{nihongo|'''''Battle Circuit'''''|BATTLE CIRCUIT|Batoru Saakitto}} is an [[action game|action]] "[[beat 'em up]]" [[video game|game]] developed and published by [[Capcom]] for the [[CPS-2]] [[arcade machine|arcade]] [[hardware]] for [[Japan]] and [[Europe]] in 1997.  Taking place in an alternate future earth, the game revolves around a group of [[bounty hunters]] who must capture the [[mad scientist]] Dr. Saturn and secure a sophisticated computer disc carrying a program known as the "[[Shiva]] System".  The game contains [[comic book|comic]]-like characters in a futuristic [[science fiction]] setting.

==Development==
''Battle Circuit'' was developed by producers Noritaka Funamizo and Yoshiki Okamoto of Capcom's arcade production team in early 1997.<ref name=credits> In-game credits for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref>  While structurally very similar to the company's early scrolling action games like ''[[Final Fight]]'' and ''[[Alien vs. Predator (arcade game)|Alien vs. Predator]]'', ''Battle Circuit'' is set apart stylistically by employing a [[manga]]-style [[science fiction|sci-fi]] approach to story and character artwork.  The art staff, overseen by Ohnishi Hiroki and Yamamoto Kouji,<ref name=credits> In-game credits for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref> created an assortment of characters with features reminiscent of older Capcom characters and superfluous [[comic book]] elements.  

The game saw a speedy translation effort that effectively made the title available in both Japan and parts of Europe on the same day.  Though there are no game play differences between the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[English language]] versions of the game, a few pieces of Japanese dialogue were omitted from the European release.  The game was not released in [[North America|North American]] arcades or any other part of the world after its initial release.<ref name=vgmuseum> "[http://www.vgmuseum.com/images/arcade3/03/3.htm Battle Circuit Arcade Info]" ''VGMuseum''.

==Game play==
[[Image:battle circuit.jpg|left|thumb|225px|In-game screenshot of ''Battle Circuit'' with four players.]]
''Battle Circuit'''s [[arcade cabinet]] provided support for up to four simultaneous players who can each assume the role of five possible characters.<ref name=klov> "[http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7038 Battle Circuit]" ''Killer List of Videogames''. URL Accessed on [[November 19]], [[2006]].</ref>  Players must progress through a number of levels made up of horizontally scrolling screens filled with enemy characters that must be defeated using a combination of attacks and movement abilities each character utilizes.  Every character is given a selection of these abilities that can be expanded as game play progress by purchasing special "upgrade discs" after the completion of each level using coins obtained by defeating enemies.  These techniques are often a combination of either of the two action buttons and the [[joystick]], and can add additional varieties to a given character's arsenal.  A player must attack enemies until their health (indicated by a bar under the player's when the enemy is attacked) is reduced to 0 and they are thus knocked out.  If a player's health bar is depleted, they will also become knocked out and must use up one life to continue.  If all of a player's lives are depleted in this fashion, the game will end unless more credits are purchased.

Special techniques called "Battle Downloads" can be used by pressing both action buttons while jumping, which results in the player and his allies (if any are present) gaining a certain attribute, the effect of which is unique to each character.  Cyber Blue, for example, can use his Battle Download "Power Up" to increase the amount of damage dealt by attacks, while Yellow Iris' "Speed Up" increases attack speed.  A character will start with a stock of two of these techniques to use per life, and can obtain more from capsules scattered throughout the levels, up to a maximum of five.

Various items can be found inside destructible objects such as barrels and crates, and can provide the player with additional health or add points to their total score.  Once a player's score reaches a set amount, they are rewarded with an extra life that will give them another chance to continue from where they were knocked out by an enemy.

==Story==
Taking place in the future year [[21st century|20XX]], ''Battle Circuit'' follows the exploits of a group of super-powered bounty hunters as they apprehend wanted criminals (identified by special serial numbers) in the city of Neo Koba.  The game begins with player attempting to apprehend criminal 9696X, a scientist named Doctor Saturn and his [[blob]]-like [[sidekick]] aboard his [[spaceship]] orbiting Earth.  After the battle, the character selected by the player returns to his employer, Harry, and is promptly given another assignment to capture the leader of the "Delete Gang", Johnny, who holds a valuable [[floppy disc]] in his possession.  The bounty hunter then confronts Johnny at his [[disco]] hideout and learns that the disc contains a malicious [[computer program]] known as the "Shiva System", which is capable of control all the computerized systems in the world.  As one of the characters chosen, player's must travel through various levels and fight through various members of the Delete Gang to obtain the disc and claim their bounty.<ref name=script> In-game script for ''Battle Circuit'', English-language version. 1997</ref>
