'''"Trapped in the Closet"''', the twelfth episode of the [[List_of_South_Park_episodes#Season_9:_2005|ninth season]] of the [[Comedy Central]] series ''[[South Park]]'', originally aired on [[November 16]], [[2005]].  The plot of the episode centers on the ''South Park'' character [[Stan Marsh]], as he joins [[Scientology]] in an attempt to find something "fun and free". After the discovery of his surprisingly high "[[thetan]] levels", he is recognized as the reincarnation of the founder of the church, [[L. Ron Hubbard]].

Though the episode was originally scheduled for rebroadcast in March 2006, the episode "[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]" was shown instead.  Comedy Central representatives stated this change was made as a tribute to Isaac Hayes, however ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] thought otherwise. Stone and Parker issued a satirical statement saying they were "servants of the dark lord [[Xenu]]". [[Isaac Hayes]], the voice of [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]], quit the show shortly before the start of the tenth season. The reason for his departure, as reported by [[Matt Stone]], was due to his faith in Scientology and this episode, which <U+2014> despite initially supporting the show's satirical take on several talk shows <U+2014> he claimed to feel was very offensive.

"Trapped in the Closet" was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] in July 2006, but the ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]" eventually received the award in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]] category. The episode was featured among [[Comedy Central]]'s list of "10 South Parks That Changed The World", spoofed by [[Conan O'Brien]] in the opening segment of the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]], and mentioned in the Scientology critique film, ''[[The Bridge (Scientology film)|The Bridge]]''.

==Plot==
Stan takes a "[[Oxford Capacity Analysis|personality test]]" that is being offered by Scientologists on the street. After answering a long [[questionnaire]], Stan is informed that he is a perfect candidate for Scientology &mdash; they offer to help him out for $240. Back at home, Stan asks his parents for money to help with his depression and his father suggests he use the money he had been saving for a new bike.<ref name="comedycentralsite">{{cite web

There, the president of Scientology determines that, because his reading is so high, Stan must be a reincarnation of [[L. Ron Hubbard]], Scientology's founder and [[prophet]].<ref name="comedycentralsite" />

Back in South Park, a large group of Scientologists, including [[John Travolta]], have gathered outside to celebrate Stan's "second coming". The President of Scientology arrives in a helicopter and talks with Stan's parents. Stan's parents oppose his being in the group, but the president informs [[Randy and Sharon Marsh]] that, "We're not asking him to ''join'' us; we're asking him to ''lead'' us." Randy sends his son Stan, confused and exhausted, to his room where he finds Tom Cruise waiting for him. Cruise, thinking Stan is genuinely Hubbard's reincarnation, asks him whether he enjoyed his acting. When Stan tells Cruise that his acting is not as good as others, Tom locks himself in Stan's bedroom closet, believing he is a failure in the eyes of the "prophet". He refuses to come out, despite Randy, [[Nicole Kidman]], John Travolta and [[R. Kelly]]'s attempts to persuade him to come out of the closet, with R. Kelly's repeated narrative similar to his [[Rap opera|hip-hop opera]] piece [[Trapped in the Closet]]. 

Downstairs, the Scientology president tries to convince Stan's parents to let their son join them. They want to reveal the great secret of life behind their church to Stan. Randy asks his son if he would like to know this information and Stan responds with a "sure". The president tells him a condensed version of the story of [[Xenu]], based directly on the actual Scientology [[Operating Thetan|OT]] III document,<ref name="arp" /> and accompanied by an onscreen caption reading, "this is what Scientologists actually believe". After explaining these beliefs, he tells Stan to continue writing where "L. Ron" left off. On the official Comedy Central Web site for the ''South Park'' episode, it is asserted that this section of "Trapped in the Closet" was not exaggerated: "Nothing about what you see here is exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously."<ref>{{cite web

Stan begins writing and, when Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny come over to invite him to the movie theater, he doesn't have time for them. Kyle is concerned about the cult that Stan has joined, but Stan assures him that Scientology is based on fact. If they can't accept that he has found meaning then they are no longer friends. Stan shows his writings to the Scientology president, who approves of most of his work, but, when Stan says, "to really be a church, [they] can't charge money to help," the president reveals to Stan that the church is a money-making scam.

[[Image:Sp 912.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Stan is presented to the Scientologists]]
Outside the house, the president introduces Stan to his followers, to whom he will read his new [[doctrine]]. However, instead of presenting it to them, Stan reveals that he is actually not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and that: "Scientology is just a big fat global scam." His followers grow angry, and threaten to sue him. Tom Cruise leaves Stan's closet and appear, threatening to sue him. Stan dares them to do so, and the episode ends with the credits listing only "John Smith" and "Jane Smith", a reference to Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology's reputations for litigiousness.<ref name="Hilden">{{cite news|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/hilden/20051206.html|title=

Trey Parker asserts that Isaac Hayes' beliefs had previously kept the show's creators from writing a full-episode which parodies Scientology. However, the decision to ultimately produce a ''South Park'' episode satirizing Scientology was partially inspired by the friendship the show's creators have with [[Penn Jillette]].  Jillette was originally planning to do an episode of ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' based on Scientology, but [[Showtime]] prohibited him from doing so to avoid the possibility of legal action from the Church of Scientology.  Trey Parker stated: {{Quotation|"We're going, That's fucked up.

==Controversy==
===Isaac Hayes' departure===
On [[March 13]], [[2006]], Hayes announced that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, though he didn't specifically mention Scientology in his statement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1731115,00.html|title=Isaac Hayes quits South Park after it satirises Scientology|accessdate=2007-03-06}}</ref> In an interview on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Showbiz Tonight]]'', he added he didn't see the episode itself, but was told about it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Morales|first=Lisa|title=Everyone's in a Stew Over 'South Park' Chef|work=[[The Washington Post]]|pages=The TV Column, p. 2 of 2.|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=[[2006-03-17]]|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/17/AR2006031702158_2.html?nav=hcmodule|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> He reportedly said to Parker and Stone, "Guys, you have it all wrong.

Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone stated "This is 100 percent having to do with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem <U+2014> and he's cashed plenty of checks <U+2014> with our show making fun of Christians {{interp|...}} He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and, to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?news=218421&GT1=7703|title=Isaac Hayes Quits 'South Park'|publisher=entertainment.msn.com|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref> However, recent reports say that Hayes was in no condition to stay, because of a stroke he suffered in January.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188463,00.html|title=Chef's Quitting Controversy|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref> According to a Fox News article, Hayes' agent Christina Kimball, herself a devout Scientologist, was the source of the statements that Hayes quit South Park.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188720,00.html|title=Bruce Willis Gets Lucky, But Not With Model|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref>

This episode was scheduled to rebroadcast on [[March 15]], [[2006]] on Comedy Central, but the airing was canceled without prior notice, and was replaced with "[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]".

While the "South Park" creators didn't directly comment on Comedy Central's decision to pull the episode, they issued a statement to Daily Variety on [[March 17]], [[2006]] indicating the battle is not over, signing the statement, "Trey Parker and Matt Stone, servants of the dark lord [[Xenu]]."

<blockquote>
"So, Scientology, you may have won THIS battle, but the million-year war for earth has just begun!

===Aftermath===
[[Image:South Park Scientology grafitti.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Matt and Trey depicted spray-painting graffiti on the church's [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] headquarters sign as a reference to the controversy]]
A few references have been made by the show and Comedy Central to Scientology as an aftermath of the controversy. On [[August 1]], [[2006]], Comedy Central placed an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' showing the ''South Park'' stars against a background of [[Celebrity Centre|L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology Celebrity Center]], with the headline, "C'mon Jews, show them who ''really'' runs Hollywood."<ref>{{cite news

The network showed its appreciation by running a full-page ad in Variety with the "South Park" boys saying, "C'mon, Jews! Show them who really runs Hollywood." The episode has been rerun many times since.</ref> Although often misunderstood by the public to parody the [[Mel Gibson DUI incident]], the advertisement actually congratulates ''South Park'' on gaining an Emmy nomination for "Trapped in the Closet" and satirizes the cancellation of the episode's rebroadcast in March.<ref>{{cite news|last=Finn|first=Natalie|title="Passion of the Jew" Part 2?

A different reference to Scientology was made accompanying the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover article ''Still Sick, Still Wrong'' celebrating the show's anniversary. The reference portrayed a likely altered photo of Matt and Trey spray-painting graffiti on the church's [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] headquarters sign, which includes "Is dum" and "Hi Tom" messages with a depiction of Cartman's head.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070309/ENTERTAIN/70309020|title=<U+2018>South Park' sticks it to Scientology again|publisher=recordonline.com|first=Robin A.|last=Rothman|coauthors=Tomcho, Sandy|date=2007-03-09|accessdate=2007-03-11}}</ref>

==Reception==
===Reviews===
In a review of ''South Park: The Complete Ninth Season'', [[IGN]] stated that "Perhaps the largest weakness of this season is that the most notorious episodes ''[[Best Friends Forever]]'' and ''Trapped in the Closet'' just don't carry the eye-popping impact that they did when they were ripped from the headlines", giving the DVD a rating of 7.0.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/768/768477p1.html|title=South Park - The Complete Ninth Season|publisher=tv.ign.com|author=Schorn, Peter|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  

''[[The Denver Post]]'' stated the jokes about Tom Cruise "work splendidly and reveal their depth on repeated viewings, much like the show in general."<ref>{{cite news|last=Wenzel|first=John|title="South Park" becomes a gem|work=[[Denver Post]]|date=[[2007-03-19]]|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_5475880|accessdate=2007-10-20}}

===Analysis===
An article in the ''Journal of the American Academy of Religion'' referred to the episode as a "scathing cartoon parody" of the Church of Scientology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|title=Fair Game: Secrecy, Security, and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America|url=http://jaar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/74/2/356 (abstract)|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|volume=74|issue=2|pages=356<U+2014>389|publisher=[[American Academy of Religion]]|date=[[2006-04-26]]|id={{ISSN|1477-4585}}, {{ISSN|0002-7189}}|accessdate=2007-10-20}}

[[University of Delaware]] [[philosophy]] professor [[Richard Hanley]] analyzed the mythology of Scientology as it relates to the episode "Trapped in the Closet," in his 2007 book: ''[[South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating]]''.<ref name="hanley">{{cite book|last=Hanley|first=Richard|title=[[South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating]]|publisher=Open Court|date=[[2007-03-28]]|pages=23, 24, 32, 41, 246, 247, 262, 283|id=ISBN 0812696131}}</ref><ref name="greto">{{cite news|last=Greto|first=Victor|title=I offend, therefore I am: University of Delaware professor aimed for 'rude and crude ' in his book on 'South Park'|work=The News Journal, Delaware Online|publisher=USA Today, Gannett|date=[[2007-04-02]]|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070402/LIFE/304020301/-1/NEWS01|accessdate=2007-10-20}}</ref> Hanley called the [[Xenu|Xenu story]], as presented in the episode, "utterly ridiculous". He compared Scientology's mythology to Christianity's [[Virgin Birth]] and the [[transubstantiation]], stating, "Let's be honest, these beliefs are just as ridiculous as those of Scientology."<ref name="greto" /><ref name="hanley" /> Hanley went on to delve into a philosophical analysis of the "evidential weight" of popularity and tradition in determining the "robustness" of beliefs.<ref name="greto" />

[[Southwest Minnesota State University]] philosophy professor Robert Arp also analyzed the philosophical and cultural aspects of the episode, in his book: ''[[South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today]]''.<ref name="arp">{{cite book|last=Arp|first=Robert (Editor)|coauthors=William Irwin (Series Editor)|title=[[South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today]]|publisher=Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy & Pop Culture Series)|date=[[2006-12-11]]|pages=27, 59, 60, 118, 120, 132, 137, 138, 140, 224|id=ISBN 1405161604 , ISBN 978-1405161602}}</ref>  Arp analyzed [[Comedy Central]]'s reaction to the episode itself, in a section of his book entitled "2005-2006: Comedy Central Caves".<ref name="arp" /> Arp mentions ''South Park's'' usage of the onscreen caption<U+2014>"This is what Scientologists actually believe."<U+2014>in the episode, noting that the same device was used in the episode "[[All About Mormons]]". In referencing this similar use of the onscreen caption device, Arp seemed to point to an inconsistency in the behavior of Comedy Central relative to the episode. He explained, "By a long shot, this show was more kind to Scientology than was "All About the Mormons" to Mormonism."<ref name="arp" /> He noted Comedy Central had suggested it would not rebroadcast the episode for the second time, though it later announced on [[July 12]], [[2006]] that it would.<ref name="arp" />

Robert Arp cited the series' winning a [[Peabody Award]] due to its willingness to criticize intolerance in April 2006 as a: "special concern for criticizing and countering intolerance," and the notion that: "the Church of Scientology suffers from the widely held perceptions that it seeks to silence former members and others who criticize its beliefs and practices," as the motivation behind the episode.<ref name="arp" />

The episode was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] on [[July 6]], [[2006]] in the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]] category,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/downloads/images/2006emmys/PrimetimeNoms.php|title=58th Primetime Emmy Awards|publisher=emmys.org|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref> the show's sixth nomination (one of which they won, for 2005's "[[Best Friends Forever]].")<ref>{{cite news|url=http://animatedtv.about.com/b/a/201869.htm|title="South Park" Finally Wins Emmy|publisher=animatedtv.about.com|accessdate=2006-11-04}}</ref> ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Seemingly Never-Ending Story]]" was the eventual recipient of the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/media/releases/2006/crtvarts2006_rel.pdf|title=Create Arts Emmys winners|publisher=emmys.org|format=[[PDF]]|accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref>  ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Tom O'Neil theorized that the "Emmy Award Winning Series" plot device used in the October 2007 episode "[[More Crap]]" may have been a reference to the missed Emmy win for "Trapped in the Closet."<ref>{{cite news

==Appearances in media==
The scene where Cruise enters the closet is referenced in the ''South Park'' segment of the opening of the [[58th Primetime Emmy Awards]] on [[August 27]], [[2006]], in which [[Conan O'Brien]] is trying to get to the show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him as he runs into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance he exits the closet and says, "There's someone else in there," referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then pops out and closes the door.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-conanthedestroyer,0,1530551.story |title=Conan the Destroyer |accessdate=2006-08-28 |publisher=zap2it.com}}</ref>

There is a scene in the film ''[[The Bridge (Scientology film)|The Bridge]]'' by Brett Hanover, where two young women inquiring about Scientology ask a Scientology volunteer if she has seen "Trapped in the Closet," the ''South Park'' episode.
