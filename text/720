===Buffalo Bills===
Wood was selected with the 28th pick of the [[2009 NFL Draft]] by the [[Buffalo Bills]]. Counted on to start at right guard, Wood joined a completely retooled offensive line that was expected to feature two rookie starters<U+2014>him, and second round pick [[Andy Levitre]] at left guard<U+2014>and no players returning at the same position. On July 28, 2009, Wood signed a five-year contract with the Bills, reportedly worth more than $12 million.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/452/story/747418.html |title=Bills sign latter of first-round picks, lineman Wood |first=Mark |last=Gaughan |newspaper=Buffalo News |date=July 29, 2009 }}</ref>

Wood immediately became the Bills starting right [[offensive guard]] next to center [[Geoff Hangartner]], with Levitre at left guard.<ref>http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2009_roster.htm</ref> On November 22, 2009, in his 10th game, Wood sustained a compound fracture of the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]] in the fourth quarter of an 18<U+2013>15 loss to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in week 11,<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/story/870526.html |title=Broken leg ends Wood's rookie season |first=Allen |last=Wilson |date=November 22, 2009 |newspaper=Buffalo News }}</ref> after Jaguars DT [[Montavious Stanley]] ran into Wood's leg.<ref name="GrahamESPN" /> Wood underwent season-ending surgery in a Jacksonville hospital and did not return to Buffalo with the team. He was placed on the injured reserve list on November 24, 2009.

On March 30, 2010, Wood told the Buffalo Bills that his leg was healing well and that he gave it an 80% chance to be ready for training camp.<ref>{{Citation |first=John |last=Wawrow |date=March 30, 2010 |title=Bills lineman Wood confident leg will be healed in time for training camp |work=The Canadian Press |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gkyDCSb0fRpp0WLX6rN_hf63mUXA }}.</ref>  He eventually started 14 games in the [[2010 NFL season]], missing only [[2010 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] and [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Vikings]] games because of an ankle injury.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5899266 |title=Buffalo Bills juggle starters on injury-ravaged offensive line |work=ESPN |date=December 8, 2010 }}</ref> The Bills were playing the same trio up the middle: Wood at right guard, Hangartner at center, and Levitre at left guard.<ref>http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2010_roster.htm</ref>

However, in 2011, Wood was switched to center, between Levitre and new starting right guard [[Kraig Urbik]].<ref>http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2011_roster.htm</ref> These three have been instrumental in the resurgence in the Bills offense, led by [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] at [[quarterback]] and [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]] at [[running back]].
