The '''Lyell Highway''' (Route '''A10''') is a highway in Tasmania, running from [[Hobart]] to [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]]. The name is derived from [[Mount Lyell (Tasmania)|Mount Lyell]], the mountain peak where copper was found in the late 19th century, the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] was the predominant business in Queenstown for almost 100 years.

== Hobart to Central Highlands section ==
Starting at [[Granton, Tasmania|Granton]] it winds along the southern side of the [[Derwent River, Tasmania|Derwent River]] in a generally north westerly direction to [[New Norfolk, Tasmania|New Norfolk]]. This section has in the past been susceptible to flooding <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26408717 |title=Lyell Highway Flooding. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=8 August 1947 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author1=Tasmania. Dept. of Infrastructure, Energy & Resources | title=Lyell Highway, Granton to New Norfolk | publication-date=2008 | publisher=Department of Infrastructure, Energy & Resources | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/35027270 | accessdate=12 October 2012 }}</ref>

At New Norfolk it crosses the Derwent River and winds its way through hilly terrain to [[Hamilton, Tasmania|Hamilton]].
Just prior to Hamilton is the turnoff to [[Bothwell, Tasmania|Bothwell]] via a sealed route that passes Arthurs Lake and ultimately goes on to [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].

== Central Highlands section ==
After Hamilton, the small town of [[Ouse, Tasmania|Ouse]] is the only other population centre on the highway until the former [[Hydroelectricity]] town of Wayatinah.

When the highway was first constructed, it made use of existing tracks and roads in the Victoria Valley area, directly north of Ouse, leaving the Ouse and Derwent River valleys and climbing the hilly country through the towns of Osterley, Victoria Valley and Dee before rejoining the present highway near Bront<U+00EB>. This route closely skirts Dee Lagoon, and runs close to several other lakes, particularly Lake Echo. 

The road is narrow, and unsealed. When the hydro-electric system was expanding and their works were under construction at Tarraleah in the mid-1940s, the highway was re-aligned to follow the Derwent River until it passed Tarraleah to provide better access to the area for construction vehicles. After Tarraleah the road climbs steeply out of the Derwent River gorge until it re-joins the original route near Bront<U+00EB>.

At Bront<U+00EB> the [[Image:Australian Alphanumeric State Route B11.svg|20px|(B11)]] [[Marlborough Highway]] turns off the main road and leads to the Great Lake, where it joins the Lakes Highway and eventually runs to Deloraine. 

A common short-cut is the '14-Mile Road' (C601), a gravel road which cuts across the Nive Plains just after Tarraleah, by-passing the steep Tarraleah Gorge section, re-joining the highway several kilometres past Bront<U+00EB>. It is not a safe alternative as it is a narrow, unsealed road, and can be frequented by log-trucks. 

In wintry conditions the whole of the Central Highlands section is susceptible to [[black ice]], and it can be exceptionally bad in the heavily forested section west of Ouse, but it can be encountered all the way to the west coast.  Snow is usually encountered in the [[Derwent Bridge, Tasmania|Derwent Bridge]] area during most winters and may force closure of the road occasionally for several days.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26203428 |title=SNOW BENDS POLES ON LYELL HIGHWAY. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=26 August 1946 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> This applies to both the newer Tarraleah section and the older Osterley-Lake Echo-Dee section.

As the highway enters Derwent Bridge it strikes a midpoint between [[Lake St Clair (Tasmania)|Lake St Clair]] to the north, and Lake King William to the south.

== West Coast section ==
This section is usually known as that west of [[Derwent Bridge, Tasmania|Derwent Bridge]] or [[Mount King William]].<ref>{{Citation | author1=Tasmania. Land Information Bureau | author2=Tasmania. Parks and Wildlife Service | title=Lyell Highway map and notes between Derwent Bridge and Strahan, Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area | publication-date=1994 | publisher=Parks and Wildlife Service Tasmania | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/12065195 | accessdate=12 October 2012 }}</ref>

It runs through the [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park]], and through the [[West Coast Range]] before reaching [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]].  There has also been a state reserve along the highway <ref>{{Citation | author1=Tasmania. Parliament | title=Management plan for the Lyell Highway State Reserve, April 1979 | publication-date=1979 | publisher=Govt. Pr | isbn=978-0-7246-0934-5 }}</ref>

The highway did not reach Queenstown until the 1930s and was not properly surfaced for some time after that. In post cards of the 1940s and 1950s it is called the ''West Coast Road''. 

Due to its altitude, the section of the highway over the plateau between Derwent Bridge and Mount King William is often closed during winter due to ice and snow.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article25878019 |title=LYELL HIGHWAY. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=27 August 1941 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>   It can also be affected by rockfalls <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26729264 |title=Landslide Blocks Lyell Highway. |newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury (Hobart, Tas. : 1860 - 1954)]] |location=Hobart, Tas. |date=22 September 1950 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

With the damming of the [[King River (Tasmania)|King River]] and the creation of [[Lake Burbury]], the highway was re-routed to a narrow point where the Bradshaw bridge could be constructed across the lake.
