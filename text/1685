''Half-Life 2'' takes place in a [[dystopia]]n world in which the events of ''Half-Life'' have fully come to bear on human society, which has been enslaved by a [[multiverse|multidimensional]] empire known as the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]]. The game takes place in and around the fictional [[Locations of Half-Life#City 17|City 17]] and follows the adventures of [[scientist]] [[Gordon Freeman]] who must fight against increasingly unfavorable odds in order to survive.

The game garnered near-unanimous positive reviews and received critical acclaim,<ref name="gamerankings">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages4/914642.asp | title = ''Half-Life 2'' PC Reviews | work = GameRankings | dateformat = mdy | accessdate = May 19, 2006}}</ref><ref name="metacritic">{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/halflife2 | title = ''Half-Life 2'' PC Reviews | work = Metacritic | dateformat = mdy |accessdate = May 20, 2006}}</ref> receiving praise for its advances in [[computer animation]], [[sound recording and reproduction|sound]], [[narrator|narration]], [[computer graphics]], [[Game AI|artificial intelligence]] (AI), and [[physics engine|physics simulation]].

Two episodic additions to the game, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'', and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'', were released (respectively) in June 2006 and October 2007 as a continuation of the storyline and the events following the original Half-Life 2, with a third and final episode in the story arc in development.
==Gameplay==
[[Image:Antlions1HL2.jpg| left | 200px | thumb | A screenshot of the player engaging a group of [[List of creatures in the Half-Life series#Antlion|antlions]]. Along the bottom of the screen the player's health, suit damage mitigation level and ammunition are displayed.]]
''Half-Life 2'' is a [[first-person shooter]], following similar mechanics from its predecessor, ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. The gameworld is always presented from Gordon Freeman's perspective. A [[heads-up display]] at the bottom of the screen shows the player's health, energy, and ammunition status, while a toggle screen shows available weapons at the top. Health and energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices.<ref name = "ignguidebasics">{{cite web | url = http://guides.ign.com/guides/492830/page_2.html | title = ''Half-Life 2'' Guide: Basics | last = Clayman | first = Dan | work = IGN | publisher = IGN Entertainment | accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref> The player navigates through a set of levels that advance in the story, fighting off [[transhuman]] troops known as the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] as well as hostile alien creatures. Puzzles and sequences involving vehicles are interspersed throughout the game.<ref name = "gamespotpcreview">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/review.html?page=4 | title = ''Half-Life 2'' for PC Review | last = Ocampo | first = Jason | work = GameSpot | publisher = CNET Networks, Inc. | date = 2004-11-15 | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}</ref>

The player defeats enemies with an assortment of weapons. The game's available arsenal consists of modern-day projectile weapons, including a ubiquitous pistol, shotgun, and submachine gun, though more elaborate, fictional weapons are available, such as a crossbow that shoots hot metal rods, a [[pheromone]] pod that guides certain previously hostile alien creatures, and a pulse rifle that can also launch "Dark energy balls," that disintegrate enemies on contact. The Source engine's physics capabilities extend into combat via a special device called the ''Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator'', or "[[Gravity gun#Half-Life 2 gravity gun|gravity gun]]." Using this device, the player can pick up objects and either hurl them at enemies or hold them in place to create a makeshift shield.<ref name = "ignguideweapons">{{cite web | url = http://guides.ign.com/guides/492830/page_3.html | title = ''Half-Life 2'' Guide: Weapons | last = Clayman | first = Dan | work = IGN | publisher = IGN Entertainment | accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref> The gravity gun can also perform a variety of non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supplies and forming bridges across gaps.<ref name = "ignpcreview">{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/566/566202p5.html |title = ''Half-Life 2'' Review (PC) | accessdate = 2008-09-21 | last = Adams | first = Dan | work = IGN | publisher = IGN Entertainment | date = 2004-11-15}}</ref> The gravity gun is often used for solving puzzles based on the game's [[physics engine]].

==Synopsis==
===Setting===
The original ''Half-Life'' takes place at a remote civilian and military [[laboratory]] called the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]]. During an experiment, researchers at Black Mesa accidentally cause  a "resonance cascade" which rips open a portal to an [[extraterrestrial life|alien world]], [[Xen (Half-Life)|Xen]]. Hostile creatures from Xen flood into Black Mesa via the portal and start killing everyone in sight. The player takes on the role of [[Gordon Freeman]], one of the research scientists who had been involved in the accident and who now must escape the facility. Gordon manages to terminate [[Creatures in the Half-Life series#Nihilanth|Nihilanth]], the creature holding the portal open. At the end of the game, a mysterious figure colloquially known as the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]] extracts Gordon from Black Mesa and "offers" him employment. Gordon is subsequently put into [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]].<ref name=halflife>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life|publisher=Valve|developer=Valve}}</ref> 

Events between the two games are revealed over the course of ''Half-Life 2''. As a direct result of Nihilanth's death, the Earth is invaded and quickly conquered by an extraterrestrial civilization, the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]]. Maintaining a police state across the globe, the Combine isolate the remaining humans into numerous cities, and use an energy field to prevent human reproduction, while using their technology to prevent alien wildlife from investing the cities. The former administrator of Black Mesa, [[Characters of Half-Life#Wallace Breen|Wallace Breen]], responsible for negotiating a peace agreement between the Combine and humans, becomes the ruler of the Earth, working with the Combine to keep the humans in check. However, an underground resistance force, including scientists from Black Mesa, maintains a quiet presence to avoid Combine capture while working on ways to defeat them.<ref name="BME">{{cite web|url=http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HL2Walkthroughs.Detail&id=16&game=3|title=''Half-Life 2'' Walkthrough<U+2014>Chapter 5: Black Mesa East|work=Planet Half-Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> Official sources differ on the actual length of the intermission beteween the two games; a story fragment written by author [[Marc Laidlaw]] for the development team puts the intermission at ten years,<ref name="raisebar">{{cite book | author = Hodgson, David | year = 2004 | title = Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar | publisher = Prima Games | isbn = 0-7615-4364-3}}</ref> while ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'''s website puts this intermission as "nearly two [[decade]]s".<ref name="episode1webpage">{{cite web | url = http://ep1.half-life2.com/story.php | title = Half-Life 2: Episode One | work = Valve Corporation | dateformat = mdy |accessdate = May 19, 2006}}</ref> 

The events of ''Half-Life 2'' takes place in [[City 17]], where Dr. Breen has set up his headquarters inside a sleek towering Combine structure called the [[Locations of Half-Life#City 17|Citadel]], and other nearby locations. The environments in ''Half-Life 2'', in accordance with the game's story, all have a distinct post-apocalyptic theme, yet in design they are varied, and include the [[Eastern Europe]]an-styled City 17, the zombie-infested [[Ravenholm]]; the coastal [[Nova Prospekt]] prison and the alien interiors of the Citadel. Viktor Antonov, the art director of ''Half-Life 2'', who spent his childhood in [[Bulgaria]], wrote that the developers consciously modeled ''Half-Life 2'''s setting on Eastern Europe because they were fascinated by the region's combination of both new and old architecture and desired to infuse City 17 and its environs with the same sense of history.

===Plot===
At the start of the game, the [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]] speaks to Gordon Freeman in a [[hallucination]]-like vision as he pulls Gordon out of stasis and places him on a train going to City 17. When the train arrives, Gordon gets off and proceeds through the Combine's security checkpoints where he is detained by a civil protection officer. Once in an interrogation room, the officer reveals himself to be Freeman's former co-worker and colleague, [[Barney Calhoun]], and helps Freeman to get to [[Dr. Isaac Kleiner]]'s laboratory. After meeting [[Alyx Vance]], Freeman is instructed by Kleiner to step into a makeshift [[teleportation|teleporter]] so that he can be safely extracted to the anti-Combine resistance base [[Black Mesa East]] along with Alyx, headed by her father, [[Dr. Eli Vance]]. However, Kleiner's pet [[headcrab]] [[Headcrab#Lamarr|Lamarr]] disrupts the machine, and Freeman finds himself&nbsp;<U+2014> after briefly appearing in several different locations&nbsp;<U+2014> just outside Kleiner's lab. With the Combine now alerted to his presence, Freeman works his way through the drained canal system,<ref name = "hl2guideII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/redletterday_41/ | title = Chapter II: Red Letter Day | work = Half-Life Fallout | dateformat = mdy|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080606001411/http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/redletterday_41/ |archivedate=2008-06-06| accessdate = 2010-04-06}}</ref> avoiding enemy forces and using the help of human resistance fighters <ref name = "hl2guideIII">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/routekanal_42/ | title = Chapter III: Route Kanal | work = Half-Life Fallout | dateformat = mdy |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080113175851/http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/routekanal_42/ |archivedate=2008-01-13| accessdate = 2010-04-06}}</ref> to safely arrive at Black Mesa East.

Dr. Vance and [[Judith Mossman|Dr. Judith Mossman]] debrief Freeman on events since the incident at Black Mesa.  As Alyx is introducing Freeman to [[Dog (Half-Life 2)|Dog]], her pet [[robot]], and showing him how to use the new Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator ("gravity gun"), the lab is attacked and Dr. Vance is captured.

Together, they discover that Dr. Mossman is a spy for the Combine, but before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Dr. Vance back to the Combine headquarters known as [[Locations of Half-Life#City 17|the Citadel]] using the Combine teleporter.

Freeman and Alyx follow, and the facility is destroyed by a teleporter malfunction. They materialize in Kleiner's lab one week later, discovering that their actions in Nova Prospekt have inspired the human resistance to mount a full-scale rebellion, turning City 17 into a battlefield.<ref name = "hl2guideX">{{cite web | url = http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/entanglement_48/ | title = Chapter X: Entanglement | work = Half-Life Fallout | dateformat = mdy |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080113173820/http://www.hlfallout.net/articles.php/entanglement_48/ |archivedate=2008-01-13| accessdate = 2010-04-06}}</ref>  Alyx helps to assist Dr. Kleiner and civilians to escape the city, while Freeman joins with the human resistance to dispatch the Combine forces.

Dr. Breen fires the Gravity Gun, releasing all the prisioners and escapes to the Dark Energy Reactor at the top of the Citadel and attempts to teleport away from Earth.

He comments on Gordon's successful endeavors and then places him back into stasis.

===Narrative===
Throughout the entirety of ''Half-Life 2'', Gordon never speaks, and the player views the action through his eyes only. There are no [[cut scene]]s, nor are there any discontinuities or jumps in time from the player's point of view. Some critics have criticized these design decisions as narrative holdovers from ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'',<ref name="gamespot">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/review.html | title = Half-Life 2 for PC Review | work = GameSpot | dateformat = mdy | accessdate = October 10, 2005}}</ref> that effectively limit how much of the [[back-story]] is explained. Due to the lack of cut scenes, the player never directly sees what happens in Gordon's absence.

The ending of ''Half-Life 2'' is also very similar to that of the original: after completing a difficult task against seemingly overwhelming odds, Gordon is extracted by the G-Man, who congratulates him and informs him that further assignments should follow. The fates of many of the major characters, such as Alyx, Eli, and Judith, go unexplained. Very few of the questions raised by ''Half-Life'' are answered, and several new ones are presented. The identity and nature of the G-Man still remains a mystery. A number of these issues are addressed, however, in the sequel games, [[Half-Life 2: Episode One|''Episode One'']] and [[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|''Episode Two'']].<ref name=halflife /><ref name=halflife2>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2|publisher=Valve|developer=Valve}}</ref><ref name=episodeone>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2: Episode One|developer=Valve|publisher=Valve}}</ref><ref name=episodetwo>{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2: Episode Two|developer=Valve|publisher=Valve}}</ref>

===Development===
[[Image:HalfLife2 City17 TrainStationSquare.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A square in City 17, showing the Source engine's lighting and shadow effects]]

For ''Half-Life 2'', [[Valve Corporation]] developed a new [[game engine]] called the [[Source engine]], which handles the game's visual, audio, and [[game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] elements. The Source engine comes packaged with a heavily modified version of the [[Havok (software)|Havok physics engine]] that allows for an extra dimension of interactivity in both single-player and online environments.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-23|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/articles/501/501838p1.html|title=Havok's Half-Life 2 Marketing Campaign |publisher=GameSpy|date=2004-03-25|author=Fudge, James }}</ref> The engine can be easily upgraded because it is separated in modules. When coupled with [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]], it becomes easy to roll out new features. One such example is [[high dynamic range rendering]], which Valve first demonstrated in a free downloadable level called ''[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]]'' for owners of ''Half-Life 2''.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-23|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/news.html?sid=6136768|title=Half-Life 2 finds Lost Coast |publisher=GameSpot|date=2005-10-27|author=Surette, Tim }}</ref> HDR is now part of all Valve games. Several other games use the Source engine, including ''[[Day of Defeat: Source]]'' and ''[[Counter-Strike: Source]]'', both of which were also developed by Valve.<ref>{{cite news|title=Impressive add-on to Day of Defeat |work=New Straits Times|date=2005-12-29|author=Tang, Lee Yu}}</ref> Also using Source is Dark Messiah, and the upcoming game ''[[The Crossing (video game)|The Crossing]]'', both developed by [[Arkane Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-26|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/the-crossing/news/what-is-the-crossing/a-2007010912733375024/g-20070109103328574003|title= What is The Crossing?  |publisher=Games Radar|date=2007-01-09|author=Richardson, Ben }}</ref>

Integral to ''Half-Life 2'' on the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows platform]] is the [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]] content delivery system developed by Valve Corporation. All ''Half-Life 2'' players on PC  are required to have Steam installed and a valid account in order to play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/566/566202p1.html |title=IGN: Half-Life 2 Review |publisher=Pc.ign.com |author=Dan Adams |date= |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Steam allows customers to purchase games and other software straight from the developer and have them [[download]]ed directly to their computer as well as receiving "micro updates." These updates also make [[hack (technology slang)|hacking]] the game harder to do and has thus far been somewhat successful in staving off [[cheating in online games|cheats]] and playability for users with [[copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copies]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4041289.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; Technology &#124; Ban hits Half-Life 2 pirates hard |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=Last Updated: |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> Steam can also be used for finding and playing multiplayer games through an integrated server browser and friends list, and game data can be backed up with a standard CD or DVD burner.

The book, ''[[Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar]]'', revealed many of the game<U+2019>s original settings and action that were cut down or removed from the game. ''Half-Life 2'' was originally intended to be a darker game with grittier artwork, where the Combine were more obviously draining the oceans for minerals and replacing the atmosphere with noxious, murky gases. [[Nova Prospekt]] was originally intended to be a small Combine rail depot built on an old prison in the wasteland. Eventually, Nova Prospekt grew from a stopping-off point along the way to the destination itself.<ref name="raisebar" /> ''Half-Life 2'' was also originally intended to be more diverse in settings. The book mentions how originally, the player was to follow a different journey from what is in the final release.

===2003 leak===
''Half-Life 2'' was merely a rumor until a strong impression at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in May 2003 launched it into high levels of hype where it won several awards for best in show. It had a release date of September 2003, but was delayed. This pushing back of ''HL2''<U+2019>s release date came in the wake of the [[security cracking|cracking]] of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s internal network<ref name="leak delays release">{{cite web |url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/31783.html |title=Half Life 2 Source-Code Leak Delays Debut |work=TechNewsWorld |dateformat=mdy |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}</ref> through a null session connection to Tangis which was [[Internet hosting service|hosted]] in Valve's network and a subsequent upload of an [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] shell, resulting in the [[Internet leak|leak]] of the game's [[source code]] and many other files including maps, models and a playable early version of Half-Life Source and Counter-Strike Source in early September 2003.<ref name="source code leak">{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/10/07/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ |title=Playable Version of Half-Life 2 Stolen |work=CNN Money |dateformat=mdy |accessdate=February 14, 2007 | date=2003-10-07}}</ref> On October 2, 2003, Valve CEO [[Gabe Newell]] publicly explained in the [http://www.halflife2.net/forums/showthread.php?threadid=10692 HalfLife2.net] forums the events that Valve experienced around the time of the leak, and requested users to track down the perpetrators if possible.

In June 2004, Valve Software announced in a press release that the [[FBI]] had arrested several people suspected of involvement in the source code leak.<ref name="axel g arrest">{{cite web |url=http://play.tm/story/3764 |title='Phatbot' man linked with Half-Life 2 leak |work=play.tm |dateformat=mdy |accessdate=February 16, 2007}}</ref> Valve claimed the game had been leaked by a German [[hacker (computer security)|black-hat hacker]] named [[Axel Gembe]]. Gembe later contacted Newell through e-mail (also providing an unreleased document planning the E3 events). Gembe was led into believing that Valve wanted to employ him as an in-house security auditor. He was to be offered a flight to the USA and was to be arrested on arrival by the FBI. When the German government became aware of the plan, Gembe was arrested in Germany instead, and put on trial for the leak as well as other computer crimes in November 2006, such as the creation of [[Agobot (computer worm)|Agobot]], a highly successful trojan which harvested users' data.<ref>Infosecurity 2008 Threat Analysis, page 16, ISBN 1597492248 ISBN 978-1597492249</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB116900488955878543-yrMHYlacFyxijV14BxFZfXeU1_8_20070216.html |title=How Legal Codes Can Hinder Hacker Cases&nbsp;<U+2014> WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref><ref>[http://wsjclassroom.com/archive/05feb/onln_hacker.htm Hacker Hitmen - Cyber Attacks Used to Be for Thrill Seekers.

At the trial in November 2006 in Germany, Gembe was sentenced to two years' probation. In imposing the sentence, the judge took into account such factors as Gembe's difficult childhood and the fact that he was taking steps to improve his situation.<ref name="axel g sentencing details">{{cite web |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB116900488955878543-yrMHYlacFyxijV14BxFZfXeU1_8_20070216.html |title=How Legal Codes Can Hinder Hacker Cases |work=Wall Street Journal Online |dateformat=mdy |accessdate=April 12, 2008}}</ref>

===Contract dispute===
On September 20, 2004, the gaming public learned through [[GameSpot]] that [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra's]] parent company, [[Vivendi Universal Games]], was in a legal battle with Valve Software over the distribution of ''Half-Life 2'' to [[Internet cafe|cyber caf<U+00E9>s]]. This is important for the Asian PC gaming market where PC and broadband penetration per capita are much lower (except [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]). Therefore, cyber caf<U+00E9>s are extremely popular for playing online games for large numbers of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/news_6107712.html|accessdate=2008-09-21|title=Valve vs. Vivendi dogfight heats up in US District Court}}</ref>

According to Vivendi Universal Games, the distribution contract they signed with Valve included cyber caf<U+00E9>s. This would mean that only Vivendi Universal Games could distribute ''Half-Life 2'' to cyber caf<U+00E9>s&nbsp;<U+2014> not Valve through the Steam system. On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas S. Zilly, of [[United States district court|U.S. Federal District Court]] in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle, WA]], ruled that Vivendi Universal Games and its affiliates, are not authorized to distribute (directly or indirectly) Valve games through cyber caf<U+00E9>s to end users for [[Pay to Play|pay-to-play]] activities pursuant to the parties' current publishing agreement. In addition, Judge Zilly ruled in favor of the Valve motion regarding the contractual limitation of liability, allowing Valve to recover copyright damages for any infringement as allowed by law without regard to the publishing agreement<U+2019>s limitation of liability clause.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-10-03|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4054643.stm|title=Half-Life 2 maker wins legal case |publisher=BBC|date=2004-11-30 }}</ref>

On April 29, 2005, the two parties announced a settlement agreement. Under the agreement, Vivendi Universal Games would cease distributing all retail packaged versions of Valve games by August 31, 2005. Vivendi Universal Games also was to notify distributors and cyber caf<U+00E9>s that had been licensed by Vivendi Universal Games that only Valve had the authority to distribute cyber caf<U+00E9> licenses, and hence their licenses were revoked and switched to Valve's.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/?area=cybercafespPublisher=Valve|accessdate=2007-03-06|title=VALVE CYBER CAF<U+00C9> PROGRAM}}</ref>

===Soundtrack===
All listed tracks were composed by [[Kelly Bailey]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.soundtrackcollector.com/catalog/soundtrackdetail.php?movieid=73862 | title = Kelly Bailey Soundtrack | work = SoundtrackCollector | accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref> Purchasers of the Gold Package of the game were given (among other things) a CD soundtrack containing nearly all the music from the game, along with three bonus tracks. This CD is available for separate purchase via the Valve online store.

Tracks 16, 18 and 42 are bonus tracks that are exclusive to the CD soundtrack. Tracks 44 to 51 are tracks from the game that did not appear on the soundtrack CD. Many of the tracks were retitled and carried over from the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' soundtrack; The names in parentheses are the original titles. Tracks 34, 41, and 42 are remixes.

===Distribution===
A 1&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] portion of ''Half-Life 2'' became available for pre-load through Steam on August 26, 2004. This meant that customers could begin to download encrypted game files to their computer before the game was released. When the game<U+2019>s release date arrived, customers were able to pay for the game through Steam, unlock the files on their hard drives and play the game immediately, without having to wait for the whole game to download. The pre-load period lasted for several weeks, with several subsequent portions of the game being made available, to ensure all customers had a chance to download the content before the game was released.<ref>{{cite web | last = Adams | first = David | title = Gabe Newell on CS: Source, HL2 Preloads | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2004-08-18 | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/540/540054p1.html | accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref>

''Half-Life 2'' was simultaneously released through Steam, [[compact disc|CD]], and on [[DVD]] in several editions. Through Steam, ''Half-Life 2'' had three packages that a customer could order. The basic version ("Bronze") includes only ''Half-Life 2'' and ''Counter-Strike: Source'', whereas the "Silver" and "Gold" (collector<U+2019>s edition) versions also include ''[[Half-Life: Source]]'' (ports of the original ''Half-Life'' and ''Day of Defeat'' mod to the new engine). The collector<U+2019>s edition/Gold version additionally includes merchandise such as a [[T-shirt]], a [[strategy guide]], and a CD containing the soundtrack used in ''Half-Life 2''. Both the disc and Steam version require Steam to be installed and active for play.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-03|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/half-life-2/554654p1.html|title=Blow Off Some Steam and Pre-Order Half-Life 2 (PC) |publisher=GameSpy|date=2004-10-06|author=Autrijve, Rainier Van }}</ref>

A [[demoware|demo]] version with the file size of a single CD was later made available in December 2004 at the web site of [[graphics card]] manufacturer [[ATI Technologies]], who teamed up with Valve for the game. The demo contains part of the opening level of the game, and also part of the chapter "We Don't Go To Ravenholm." In September 2005, [[Electronic Arts]] distributed the ''Game of the Year'' edition of ''Half-Life 2''. Compared to the original CD-release of ''Half-Life 2'', the ''GOTY'' edition adds ''Half-Life: Source''.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-03|url=http://ati.amd.com/gitg/promotions/halflife2demo/index.html|title= Half-Life 2 Demo now available   |publisher=ATI }}</ref>

On December 22, 2005, Valve released a [[64-bit]] version of the Source game engine that theoretically takes advantage of [[x86-64]] processor-based systems running [[Windows XP editions#Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]], [[Windows Server 2003|Windows Server 2003 x64]], [[Windows Vista|Windows Vista x64]], or [[Windows Server 2008|Windows Server 2008 x64]]. This update, delivered via Steam, enabled ''Half-Life 2'' and other Source-based games to run natively on 64 bit processors, bypassing the [[WOW64|32-bit compatibility layer]]. [[Gabe Newell]], one of the founders of Valve, stated that this is "an important step in the evolution of our game content and tools," and that the game benefits greatly from the update.<ref name="amd64">{{cite web | url = http://store.steampowered.com/news/496/ | title= VALVE UNVEILS 64-BIT SOURCE(TM) GAMING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AMD | work = Steam Powered | dateformat = mdy |accessdate= March 23, 2006}}</ref> The response to the release varied: some users reported huge performance boosts, while technology site Techgage found several stability issues and no notable frame rate improvement.<ref name="techgage">{{cite web |first=Rob |last=Williams| url = http://techgage.com/article/half-life_2_64-bit_-_reason_to_get_excited | title= Review: Half-Life 2: 64-Bit&nbsp;<U+2014> Reason to get excited? | work = Techgage | dateformat = mdy | accessdate= 2006-03-23}}</ref> 64-bit users have widely reported bizarre in-game errors including characters dropping dead, game script files not being pre-cached (i.e., loaded when first requested instead), map rules being bent by AI, and other glitches.<ref name="64-bit problems">{{cite web | url = http://www.planetamd64.com/index.php?showtopic=29521 | title= Latest Steam Update&nbsp;<U+2014> Half-Life 2 x64 Broken| publisher= PlanetAMD64| accessdate = 2008-09-21}}<br/>{{cite news | url = http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life_2:_Episode_One_Error_Reports#A_Bunch_of_Finger_Pointing | title= A Bunch of Finger Pointing|praca= Half-Life 2: Episode One Error Reports| publisher= Valve Developer Community| accessdate = 2008-09-21|date=2006-06-04}}</ref>

An [[Xbox]] [[porting|port]] published by Electronic Arts was released on November 15, 2005.

During Electronic Arts<U+2019>s summer press event on July 13, 2006, [[Gabe Newell]], cofounder of Valve Corporation, announced that ''Half-Life 2'' would ship on next-generation consoles (specifically, the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]]) along with episodes ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|One]]'' and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Two]]'', ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]''<ref name="nextgenconfirmation" /> in a package called ''[[The Orange Box]]''. The [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version was released on October 10, 2007 as both a retail boxed copy, and as a download available through Valve<U+2019>s [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam service]]. The Xbox 360 version was also released on October 10, 2007.

''Half-Life 2'' was selected by readers of The Guardian as the best game of the decade, with praise given especially to the environment design throughout the game. According to the newspaper, it "pushed the envelope for the genre, and set a new high watermark for [[First-person shooter|FPS]] narrative". One author commented: "Half Life 2 always felt like the European arthouse answer to the Hollywood bluster of [[Halo (video game)|Halo]] and [[Call of Duty]]".<ref name="guardian1"/>

''Half-Life 2'' won [[Crispy Gamer]]'s 'Game of the Decade'<ref name="crispygamer1"/> tournament style poll. It also won [[Reviews on the Run]]'s<ref name="reviewsontherun1"/> and [[IGN]]'s<ref name="autogenerated1"/> best game of the decade.

==Expansions and modifications==
{{main|Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Half-Life 2: Episode One|Half-Life 2: Episode Two}}

Since the release of ''Half-Life 2'', Valve Corporation has released an additional level and two additional "expansion" sequels. The level, "[[Half-Life 2: Lost Coast|Lost Coast]]," takes place between the levels "Highway 17" and "Sandtraps" and is primarily a showcase for [[high dynamic range rendering]] (HDR) technology. The first "expansion" sequel, ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One]]'', takes place immediately after the events of ''Half-Life 2'', with the player taking on the role of Gordon Freeman once again and with Alyx Vance playing a more prominent role. ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two]]'' continues directly from the ending of Episode One, with Alyx and Gordon making their way to White Forest Missile base, the latest hideout of the resistance. A further "episode" is set to be released in the future, dubbed ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Three|Episode Three]]''; being the last expansion, "in a trilogy."<ref name="ep2.ep3.confirmation">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2aftermath/news.html?sid=6151796l | title = Half-Life 2: Episode One gold, Two dated, Three announced | work = GameSpot | dateformat = mdy |accessdate = May 25, 2006}}</ref> In an interview with [[Eurogamer]], Gabe Newell revealed that the ''Half-Life 2'' "episodes" are essentially ''Half-Life 3''.<ref name="eps.are.halflife3">{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=65345&page=1 | title = Interview&nbsp;<U+2014> Opening the Valve | work = Eurogamer | dateformat = mdy | accessdate = June 7, 2006}}</ref> He reasons that rather than force fans to wait another six years for a full sequel, Valve Corporation would release the game in episodic installments.<ref name="eps.are.halflife3" /> Newell admits that a more correct title for these episodes should have been "''Half-Life 3: Episode One''" and so forth, having referred to the episodes as ''Half-Life 3'' repeatedly through the interview.<ref name="eps.are.halflife3" />

===Third-party mods===
{{main|List of Half-Life 2 mods}}
Since the release of the Source engine [[Software development kit|SDK]], a large number of [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] (mods) have been developed by the ''Half-Life 2'' community. Mods vary in scale, from fan-created levels and weapons, to partial conversions such as ''Rock 24'', ''Half-Life 2 Substance'' and ''SMOD'' (which modify the storyline and gameplay of the pre-existing game), [[SourceForts]] and [[Garry's Mod]] (which allow the player to experiment with the physics system in a [[sandbox (videogames)|sandbox]] mode), to [[mod (computer gaming)#Total conversion|total conversions]] such as ''[[Dystopia (computer game)|Dystopia]]'', ''[[Zombie Master]]'' or ''[[Iron Grip: The Oppression]]'', the latter of which transforms the game from a first-person shooter into a real-time strategy game.  Some mods take place in the ''Half-Life'' universe; others in completely original settings. Many more mods are still in development, including ''Lift'', ''The Myriad'', ''Operation Black Mesa'', and the [[episodic games|episodic]] single-player mod ''[[MINERVA (mod)|MINERVA]]''. Several multiplayer mods, such as ''[[Pirates, Vikings and Knights II]]'', a predominately sword-fighting game, ''[[Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat]]'', which focuses on realistic modern infantry combat and ''[[Jailbreak Source]]'' have been opened to the public as a beta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pvkii.com/|title=''Pirates, Vikings & Knights II''| publisher=PVKII Team|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref><ref name="insurgencywebpage">{{cite web | url = http://www.insmod.net | title = Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat | work = Insurgency Team | dateformat = mdy |accessdate = February 4, 2008}}</ref> As part of its community support, Valve announced in September 2008 that several mods, with more planned in the future, were being integrated into the [[Steam_(content_delivery)|Steamworks]] program, allowing the mods to make full use of Steam's distribution and update capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://storefront.steampowered.com/Steam/Marketing/message/1843/ |title=Steam News Update Friday, September 26, 2008 |date=2008-09-26|publisher=[[Valve Corporation]]|work=[[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]]|accessdate=2008-09-27}}</ref>
