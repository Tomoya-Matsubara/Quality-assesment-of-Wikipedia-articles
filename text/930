'''Rotavirus''' is the most common cause of [[virus|viral]] [[gastroenteritis]] in infants and all children suffer from at least one rotavirus infection before their fifth birthday. Rotavirus is found all over the world but in the [[developing country|developing countries]] approximately 100 million cases of rotavirus infection occur annually in children under five and around 600,000 die. In the US, rotaviruses cause an estimated one million episodes of gastroenteritis and 150 deaths of children every year.

Rotavirus is an [[RNA virus]] and seven [[species]] have been identified. Rotavirus A is the species that causes over 90% of infections in humans. There are different strains of Rotavirus A and many children suffer from more than one infection during their early years. The infection is spread via the [[fecal-oral route]] and huge numbers of rotaviruses are excreted by infected children. The virus has a triple-layered [[protein]] coat and is very stable outside the body.

All strains of rotavirus infect the cells of [[small intestine]] and produce a powerful [[enterotoxin]] that causes diarhoea which helps to spread the infection rapidly within families and communities.

Rotavirus is also important in veterinary medicine, as it infects the young of many animals. As with [[Influenza]], animals infected by rotavirus may act as a reservoir for new strains of rotavirus that could cause epidemics.

In 2003 the [[World Health Organization]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] established the Rotavirus Vaccine Program to reduce child [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] from diarrhoeal disease by making a vaccine against rotavirus available for use in developing countries.

The name rotaviruses was first suggested in 1977 by [[Thomas Henry Flewett]] because of the resemblance of rotavirus particles to wheels when they are examined by [[transmission electron microscopy]].<ref name="pmid68765">{{cite journal |author=Thouless ME, Bryden AS, Flewett TH, ''et al'' |title=Serological relationships between rotaviruses from different species as studied by complement fixation and neutralization |journal=Arch.

===Rotavirus proteins===
[[Image:Rotavirus Structure.png|right|thumb|300px|A simplified diagram of the location of rotavirus structural proteins]]
There are six  viral proteins, (VP) which form the virus particle ([[virion]]). These are called VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, VP5, VP6 and VP7 and five non-structural proteins that are only produced in cells infected by rotavirus. These are called  [[NSP1(Rotavirus)|NSP1]],  [[NSP2(Rotavirus)|NSP2]],  [[NSP3(Rotavirus)|NSP3]],   [[NSP4(Rotavirus)|NSP4]],  [[NSP5(Rotavirus)|NSP5]] and  [[NSP6(Rotavirus)|NSP6]].
VP1 is located in the core of the virus particle and is an [[RNA polymerase]] [[enzyme]].<ref name="pmid17657346">{{cite journal |author=V<U+00E1>squez-del Carpi<U+00F3> R, Morales JL, Barro M, Ricardo A, Spencer E |title=Bioinformatic prediction of polymerase elements in the rotavirus VP1 protein |journal=Biol.

===Replication===
[[Image:Rotavirus replication.png|thumb|left|400px|A simplified drawing of the rotavirus replication cycle]]
Rotaviruses infect the cells that line the small intestine. Their triple [[protein]] coats make them very resistant to the acidic [[pH]] of the stomach, and also the digestive enzymes (lipases and proteases) in the gut.

They enter cells by endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an ''endosome''. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This causes the breakdown of VP7 [[Trimer (biochemistry)|trimer]]s into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 coats around the viral ds[[RNA]], forming a double-layer particle (DLP).

While the eleven ds[[RNA]] strands are still within the protection of the two protein shells, the viral [[RNA replicase|RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] creates [[mRNA]] transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses called [[RNA interference]] that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA. 

During the infection, rotavirus produces mRNA for both protein translation and genome replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in structures known as [[viroplasm]]s, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasms are electron-dense structures found as early as two hours after virus infection around the cell nucleus. Viroplasms are viral factories and are thought to be formed by two viral non-structural proteins, NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by [[RNA interference]] results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.<ref name="pmid15010218">{{cite journal |author=Jayaram H, Estes MK, Prasad BV |title=Emerging themes in rotavirus cell entry, genome organization, transcription and replication |journal=Virus Res. |volume=101 |issue=1 |pages=67<U+2013>81 |year=2004 |pmid=15010218 |doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2003.12.007}}</ref>

== Pathogenesis==
Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a self-limiting, mild to severe disease characterized by [[vomiting]], watery [[diarrhoea]], and low-grade [[fever]]. The infective dose is 10<U+2013>100 infectious viral particles. Large numbers of virus are in the faeces (10<sup>8</sup><U+2013>10<sup>10</sup> infectious particles per ml), and infection can be readily acquired through contaminated hands, objects, or utensils. 
[[Image:Rotavirus infected gut.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Electron micrograph of a rotavirus infected enterocyte (top) compared to an uninfected cell (bottom). The bar = approx. 500&nbsp;nM]]
The virus infects [[enterocyte]]s of the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] of the [[small intestine]], leading to structural changes of the [[epithelium]] and diarrhea. The result of  this infection is complex,  and it is affected by an interaction of host and viral factors. Rotavirus diarrhoea is caused by several mechanisms which include:  malabsorption that occurs secondary to the destruction of enterocytes, a reduced supply of blood to the cells that line the small intestine,  an activation of the enteric nervous system, and the flow of fluid into the gut from the tissues and blood that is caused by the rotavirus non-structural protein, NSP4, which is an  [[enterotoxin]]. NSP4 causes an age and dose-dependent diarrhoea in young rodents that is similar to the natural infection. NSP4 also  causes  cells to become permeable and damages them.

The incubation period ranges from one to three days. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by four to eight days of diarrhoea. Recovery is usually complete. However, severe diarrhoea ''without'' fluid and electrolyte replacement may result in death.

== Epidemiology==
"Infantile diarrhoea", "winter diarrhoea", "stomach 'flu", "acute nonbacterial infectious gastroenteritis", and "acute viral gastroenteritis" are other names applied to this disease.
Humans of all ages are susceptible to rotavirus infection, but children six months to two years of age, the elderly, and the immunocompromised are particularly susceptible to more severe symptoms. Rotaviruses are transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route]]. Person-to-person spread through contaminated hands is probably the most important means by which rotaviruses are transmitted in close communities such as pediatric and geriatric wards, day care centers and family homes.<ref name="pmid16418157">{{cite journal |author=Leung AK, Kellner JD, Davies HD |title=Rotavirus gastroenteritis |journal=Advances in therapy |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=476<U+2013>87 |year=2005 |pmid=16418157 |doi=}}</ref>
Infected food handlers may contaminate foods that require handling and no further cooking, such as salads, fruits, and hors d'oeuvres. Rotaviruses are quite stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels as high as 1<U+2013>5 infectious particles per gallon. Sanitary measures adequate for [[bacteria]] and [[parasite]]s seem to be ineffective in endemic control of rotavirus, as similar incidence of rotavirus infection is observed in countries with both high and low health standards.<ref name="pmid11052397">{{cite journal |author=Dennehy PH |title=Transmission of rotavirus and other enteric pathogens in the home |journal=Pediatr.

== Diagnosis==
[[Image:Multiple rotavirus particles.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rotavirus particles in the faeces of an infected child]]

Specific diagnosis of the disease is made by identification of the virus in the patient's stool. [[Enzyme immunoassay]] (EIA) is the test most widely used to screen clinical specimens, and several commercial kits are available for group A rotavirus. [[Electron microscopy]] and [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]] are used in some laboratories in addition or as an alternative to EIA.<ref name="pmid3132369">{{cite journal |author=Beards GM |title=Laboratory diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis |journal=Eur.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for rotavirus, so treatment of the disease is aimed at managing the symptoms.  Depending on the severity of these treatment consists of [[Oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]] with water, or fluids containing sugars and salts.<ref name="pmid8855579">{{cite journal |author=Sachdev HP |title=Oral rehydration therapy |journal=Journal of the Indian Medical Association |volume=94 |issue=8 |pages=298<U+2013>305 |year=1996 |pmid=8855579 |doi=}}</ref> About one out of every 40 children develops severe enough dehydration to require hospitalisation.

== Vaccines ==
In 1998 a rotavirus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States. Clinical trials in the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by group A rotavirus, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer of the vaccine, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the vaccine may have contributed to an increased risk for [[Intussusception (medical disorder)|intussusception]], or bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus vaccine.<ref name="pmid16099078">{{cite journal |author=Bines J |title=Intussusception and rotavirus vaccines |journal=Vaccine |volume=24 |issue=18 |pages=3772<U+2013>6 |year=2006 |pmid=16099078 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.07.031}}</ref>

[[Image:Poliodrops.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Child receiving a live vaccine]]
RotaTeq is a live, oral pentavalent vaccine that contains five rotaviruses produced by [[reassortment]]. The rotavirus parent strains of the reassortants were isolated from human and bovine hosts. Four reassortant rotaviruses express one of the outer capsid, VP7, proteins (serotypes G1, G2, G3, or G4) from the human rotavirus parent strain and the attachment protein VP4 (type P7) from the bovine rotavirus parent strain. The fifth reassortant virus expresses the attachment protein VP4, (type P1A), from the human rotavirus parent strain and the outer capsid protein VP7 (serotype G6) from the bovine rotavirus parent strain.

In February 2006, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] approved RotaTeq for use in the United States. Merck announced a price of $187.50 for the standard three-dose regimen; this is much more expensive than other standard childhood immunisations and, even allowing for discounts, will probably prevent widespread use of the vaccine in poor countries.  However, Merck is selling vaccines at dramatically lower prices in developing world countries and is working with a range of partners including the Rotavirus Vaccine Project, PATH, (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) and other governmental and non-governmental organisations to develop and implement mechanisms for providing access to this vaccine in the developing world.<ref name="pmid12598149">{{cite journal |author=McCarthy M |title=Project seeks to "fast track" rotavirus vaccine |journal=Lancet |volume=361 |issue=9357 |pages=582 |year=2003 |pmid=12598149 |doi=}}</ref>

Outbreaks of group A rotavirus diarrhea are common among hospitalised infants, young children attending day care centres, and elderly persons in nursing homes.
