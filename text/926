'''Xorr the God-Jewel''' is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].

Six million years ago, a humanoid race covered its planet with a nuclear force shield for protection when its sun went nova.  The planet wandered through space after the nova occurred, and somewhat slowly contracted to a fraction of its former size.  The energy of the shield caused the planet to turn into a crystalline body.  By then the planet had absorbed the life forces of its humanoid inhabitants and had become sentient.  It called itself Xorr the God-Jewel, accumulated more energy by destroying worlds, and planned to conquer the universe.

Eventually, the force of a nova reduced Xorr to drifting debris, much of which was collected by the [[List of Marvel Comics alien races#G|Gramosians]] led by [[Mercurio the 4-D Man|Mercurio]].<ref>Thor #216</ref>

Xorr claimed that its humanoid inhabitants were responsible for creating all humanoid races, including [[Homo sapiens (Marvel Comics)|Earth humans]], the [[Skrull]]s, and the [[Kree]].  However, Xorr's humanoids have no known connection with the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], who did influence human and Skrull evolution, and there is no evidence to support these claims of Xorr's.
