The '''Lighthouse Caf<U+00E9>''' is a [[nightclub]] located at 30 Pier Avenue in [[Hermosa Beach, California]]. It has been active since 1949 and was one of the central [[West Coast jazz]] clubs from the 1950s throughout the late 1970s.

A [[restaurant]] called Verpilate's was built at 30 Pier Avenue in 1934, and it was converted into the Lighthouse, a bar, in 1940. The club first began showcasing [[jazz]] music on May 29, 1949, when owner John Levine permitted [[bassist]] [[Howard Rumsey]] to start a recurring Sunday [[jam session]] on a trial basis. The experiment was a success. Rumsey became club manager soon after, and put together a [[house band]] called the Lighthouse All Stars. 

While the club also hosted visiting groups, the Lighthouse All Stars became a noted ensemble in its own right, which had among its guest musicians [[Chet Baker]], [[Gerry Mulligan]] and [[Miles Davis]]. The longest-running members of the Lighthouse All Stars were [[Bob Cooper (musician)|Bob Cooper]] ([[saxophone]]), [[Conte Candoli]] ([[trumpet]]), and [[Stan Levey]] ([[Drum kit|drums]]). 

West Coast jazz stalwarts [[Shorty Rogers]], 
[[Richie Kamuca]], [[Shelly Manne]], and [[Jimmy Giuffre]] were also regulars in the early days. It also became an important venue for recordings; [[Art Pepper]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], [[Don Ellis]], [[Mose Allison]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]], [[The Three Sounds]], the [[Jazz Crusaders]],<ref>[http://books.google.es/books?id=1yXVEjS-j8IC&pg=PT250&lpg=PT250&dq=Nippy+Noya+AND+Allmusic&source=bl&ots=WAekuxlMOH&sig=AHWecm4FXtE5D_VVN1NIPZedzeo&hl=es&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result#v=onepage&q=jazz%20Crusaders&f=false The Allmusic Guide to Jazz] at Google Books</ref> and [[Joe Henderson]] all made recordings there. 

The Lighthouse sponsored an inter-collegiate jazz festival late in the 1950s, and the competition's winners included [[Mike Melvoin]] and [[Les McCann]].

John Levine died in 1970, and his family sold the club to Rudy Onderwyzer, manager and part owner of [[Shelly Manne]]'s club, Shelly's Manne-Hole. Rumsey left the Lighthouse in the 1970s, and Onderwyzer sold it again in 1981. The new owners remodeled the club and mostly discontinued the jazz-music policy. From the middle of the 1990s, jazz began to come back to the club, first on Sundays, then on Saturdays and Wednesdays.
