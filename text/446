Further information was released when Italian journalist [[Gianluigi Nuzzi]] published letters from [[Carlo Maria Vigan<U+00F2>]], formerly the second ranked Vatican administrator to the [[pope]], in which he [[Carlo Maria Vigan<U+00F2>#Secretary General of the Vatican City Governatorate|begged not to be transferred]] for having exposed alleged corruption that cost the [[Holy See]] millions in higher contract prices. Vigan<U+00F2> is now the [[Apostolic Nunciature to the United States|Apostolic Nuncio to the United States]]. The name "VatiLeaks" is a [[pun|play on]] the word ''[[WikiLeaks]]'', a not-for-profit media organisation whose goal is to bring important news and information to the public; providing an anonymous way for sources to leak information to their journalists.

Over the following months the situation widened as documents were leaked to Italian journalists, uncovering power struggles inside the Vatican over its efforts to show greater financial transparency and comply with international norms to fight [[money laundering]]. In early 2012, an anonymous letter made the headlines for its warning of a death threat against [[Pope Benedict XVI]].<ref name="independent1"/> The scandal escalated in May 2012 when Nuzzi published a book entitled ''[[His Holiness: The Secret Papers of Benedict XVI]]'' consisting of confidential letters and memos between Pope Benedict and his personal secretary,<ref name="google1">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gWr-mfVtHJn9yNC5SdrRDVvw9x0A?docId=99326afe325b40028903beb8e4227ce8|title=The Associated Press: Vatican confirms pope's butler arrested in scandal|publisher=Google|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> a controversial book that portrays the Vatican as a hotbed of jealousy, intrigue and underhanded factional fighting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Vatican newspaper editor accused of gay smear against rival|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/9284994/Vatican-newspaper-editor-accused-of-gay-smear-against-rival.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> The book reveals details about the Pope's personal finances, and includes tales of bribes made to procure an audience with him.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHAT IS BEHIND THE VATILEAKS PLOT?

==Vatican internal investigation==
Pope Benedict appointed a [[council|commission]] of cardinals to investigate the leaks in March 2012. The Vatican probe into the leaks  worked along several tracks, with Vatican magistrates pursuing the criminal investigation and the [[cardinal secretary of state|Vatican secretariat of state]] an administrative probe. The three cardinals appointed by Benedict acted in a supervisory role, looking beyond the narrow criminal scope of the leaks to interview broadly across the Vatican bureaucracy; they purportedly uncovered a sexual and blackmail scandal.<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/> They reported directly to the pope, and could both share information with Vatican prosecutors and receive information from them, according to Vatican spokesman the [[Federico Lombardi|Rev. Federico Lombardi]]. The group was headed by [[Juli<U+00E1>n Herranz Casado|Cardinal Julian Herranz]], an [[Opus Dei]] prelate who headed the Vatican's legal office as well as the disciplinary commission of the Vatican bureaucracy before retiring.<ref name="foxnews1"/>

==Arrest of Paolo Gabriele==
Paolo Gabriele, who had been the pope's personal butler since 2006, leaked the stolen information to [[Gianluigi Nuzzi]]. He was arrested on 23 May 2012 after confidential letters and documents addressed to the pope and other Vatican officials were found in his Vatican apartment. The arrest was made by [[Vatican police]], who claimed to have found classified documents in his apartment that Gabriele shared with his wife and three children.<ref name="google1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5913526/vatican-documents-leak-the-butler-did-it|title=Vatican Documents Leak: The Butler Did It |publisher=Gawker|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> Similar documents had been published in Italian media over the previous five months; many of them dealt with allegations of corruption, abuse of power and a lack of financial transparency at the Vatican.<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1203063.htm Papal butler's lawyers say client acted out of love for church, pope]</ref>

==Papal response==
On 30 May 2012, Pope Benedict made his first direct comments on the scandal in remarks at the end of his weekly general audience.<ref name='google2'>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hlIIJlaZhzmXG9T60ztbm9_nQcZw?docId=a75547d274094085aa0892c3c238d083 |title=The Associated Press: Pope breaks silence over Vatileaks scandal|publisher=Google|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=30 May 2012}}</ref> The Pope said the "exaggerated" and "gratuitous" rumours had offered a false image of the Holy See,<ref name='google2'/> commenting "The events of recent days about the Curia and my collaborators have brought sadness in my heart...I want to renew my trust in and encouragement of my closest collaborators and all those who every day, with loyalty and a spirit of sacrifice and in silence, help me fulfill my ministry."

On 26 July, Pope Benedict held a meeting of the commission of cardinals. Included in attendance, were the head of the Vatican police, those judges involved in the case, and representatives of the Vatican secretariat of state, according to a report from Federico Lombardi.<ref>[http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1203163.htm Pope hosts top-level meeting on leaks in Vatican]</ref>

==Trial of Paolo Gabriele and papal pardon==

Piero Antonio Bonnet, the Vatican's judge, had been instructed to examine the evidence of the case and to decide whether there is sufficient material to proceed to trial. Prior to conviction, Gabriele faced a maximum sentence of 8 years for the illegal possession of documents of a head of state.<ref>"Messia, Hada (CNN). {{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/06/world/europe/vatican-leaks-trial/ |title=Verdict Expected in 'Vatileaks' Trial of Pope's Ex-butler |publisher= CNN.com |date= |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> The sentence was to be served in an Italian prison, due to an agreement between Italy and the Vatican.<ref name='BBCJul22'>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18940988|title=Vatican: Pope's butler moved to house arrest|publisher=BBC News Online|accessdate=22 July 2012|date=21 July 2012}}</ref>

In a surprise announcement, Pope Benedict [[resigned]] on February 28, 2013. 

Although the dossier was available only to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and the investigators themselves, the latter were free to discuss the results of their investigation with the Cardinal electors of the [[Papal conclave, 2013|March 2013 Papal Conclave]], and the dossier itself was to have been given to Benedict's successor as Pope, [[Pope Francis|Francis]].<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/02/results-of-vatileaks-probe-for-popes-eyes-only/</ref> On March 1, 2013, Fr.

On 12 June 2013 it was reported that leaked notes of a private conversation between Pope Francis and Catholic officials at the Latin American Conference of Religious (CLAR) confirmed the existence of "a stream of corruption", and that "The '[[gay]] lobby' is mentioned, and it is true, it is there <U+2026> We need to see what we can do". According to ''[[The Economist]]'' "Vatican investigators had identified a network of gay prelates".<ref>http://www.economist.com/news/international/21582553-pope-wows-brazil-battlesand-trapslie-home-style-and-substance Pope Francis: Style and substance</ref> CLAR confirmed that its leaders had written a synopsis of the pope's remarks, although not for publication. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi made no comment on the remarks made in "a private meeting".<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/reports-pope-gay-prelate-network The Guardian newspaper: Pope Francis 'admits that gay prelate network exists', 12 June 2013]</ref>
