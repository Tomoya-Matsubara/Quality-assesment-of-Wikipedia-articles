'''Wellingborough''' is a market town and [[borough]] in [[Northamptonshire]], England, situated some {{convert|11|mi}} from the county town of [[Northampton]]. The town is situated on the north side of the [[River Nene]],<ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tab=wl Google Maps: Wellingborough] Retrieved 29 January 2010</ref> most of the older town is sited on the flanks of the hills above the river's [[flood plain]].<ref name="Geology"/> Due to frequent flooding by  the River Nene, the town was mostly built above the level  of the flood plain. Originally named "Wendelingburgh", the town was founded in the early 6th century [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] period by a Saxon leader called Waendel<ref name="Name"/> and is mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' under the name of "Wendelburie". The town was granted a royal market [[Royal charter|charter]] in 1201, by [[John of England|King John of England]].<ref name="Wellingborough Market"/>

As of the 2001 census it has a population of 72,519.<ref name="pop">[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/pyramids/pages/34uh.asp UK Statistics: Wellingborough] Retrieved 28 January</ref> The town of Wellingborough is governed by The [[Wellingborough (borough)|Borough Council of Wellingborough]], with their office located in the town centre.<ref>[http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/downloads/file/2523/wellingborough_location_map The Borough Council of Wellingborough Location map] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref> The town is twinned with [[Niort]] in France, and with [[Wittlich]] in Germany.

The town is predicted to grow by around 30&nbsp;percent under the Milton Keynes South Midlands (MKSM) study, as the UK government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire where growth will be directed over the next 30&nbsp;years. The study allocates 12,800 additional homes mainly to the east of the town.<ref name="NNDC"/> The town has also a growing commuter population as it is located on the [[Midland Main Line]] railway, which has [[East Midlands Trains|InterCity]] trains to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]] station taking under an hour, giving an interchange with [[Eurostar]] services.<ref>[http://www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk/EMTrains/YourDestinations/Eurostar/ East Midlands Trains: Interchange with Eurostar] Retrieved 2 March 2010</ref>

==History==
The town was founded in the early 6th-century period by a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] leader named Waendel and was named 'Wendelingburgh', now known as Wellingborough.<ref name="Name">[http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=402&pageNumber=1 The Borough Council of Wellingborough: Wendel History] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref>

[[Image:All Hallows Church Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 182640.jpg|thumb|left|All Hallows Church]]
The medieval town of Wellingborough housed a modest [[monastic grange]] &ndash; now the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] [[Croyland Abbey, Wellingborough|Croyland 'Abbey']] &ndash; which was an offshoot of the larger monastery of [[Croyland Abbey]], near [[Peterborough]], some {{convert|30|mi}} down-river. This part of the town is now known as 'Croyland'.<ref name="wards"/>

All Hallows Church<ref>[http://allhallowswellingborough.com/Welcome.aspx All Hallows Church] Retrieved 23 August 2009</ref> is the oldest existing building in Wellingborough and dates from c.&nbsp;1160. The manor of Wellingborough belonged to [[Crowland Abbey]] Lincolnshire, from Saxon times and the monks probably built the original church.<ref>[http://crowlandabbey.org.uk/ Crowland Abbey] Retrieved 21 August 2009</ref> The earliest part of the building is the [[Anglo-Norman|Norman]] doorway opening in from the later south porch. The church was enlarged with  the addition of more side chapels  and by the end of the 13th century had assumed more or less its present plan. The west tower, crowned with a graceful [[broach spire]] rising to {{convert|160|ft}}, was completed about 1270, after which the chancel was rebuilt and given the east window twenty years later.<ref>[http://allhallowswellingborough.com/aboutus.aspx All Hallows Church: History] Retrieved 26 February 2010</ref> The 20th-century Church of St Mary was built by [[Sir John Ninian Comper|Ninian Comper]].<ref>[http://architectdesign.blogspot.com/2009/08/st-marys-wellingborough.html Achitect Design: St Mary's Wellingborough] Retrieved 23 August 2009</ref>

Wellingborough was given a Market Charter dated 3 April 1201 when [[John of England|King John]] granted it to the "Abbot of Croyland and the monks serving God there" continuing, "they shall have a market at Wendligburg (Wellingborough) for one day each week that is Wednesday".<ref name="Wellingborough Market">[http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=123&pageNumber=1 Wellingborough Market] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref>

In the [[Elizabethan era]] the [[Lord of the Manor]], Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] was a sponsor of [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s expeditions; Drake renamed one of his ships the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' after the heraldic symbol of the Hatton family. A hotel in  a Grade II listed building built in 1600s, was known variously as the Hind Hotel and later as the Golden Hind Hotel.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Golden Hind Hotel |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=233806&mode=quick |publisher=Images of England |retrieved= 26 June 2010}}</ref>

During the Civil War the largest substantial conflict in the area was the [[Battle of Naseby]] in 1645, although a minor skirmish in the town resulted in the killing of a parliamentarian officer Captain John Sawyer. Severe reprisals followed which included the carrying off to Northampton of the parish priest, Thomas Jones, and 40 prisoners by a group of [[Roundheads]]. However, after the Civil War Wellingborough was home to a colony of [[Diggers]]. Little is known about this period.

Originally the town had two railway stations: the first called {{stnlnk|Wellingborough London Road}},<ref name="London Rd">[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/w/wellingborough_london_road/index.shtml Subterranea Britannica: Wellingborough London Road]</ref> opened in 1845 and closed in 1966, linked [[Northampton and Peterborough Railway|Peterborough with Northampton]]. The second station, [[Wellingborough railway station|Wellingborough Midland Road]], is still in operation with trains to London and the [[East Midlands]]. Since then the 'Midland Road' was dropped from the station name.<ref>{{cite book |author=Radford, B |date=1983 |title=Midland Line Memories: a Pictorial History of the Midland Railway Main Line Between London (St Pancras) & Derby |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury Books}}</ref> The Midland Road station opened in 1857 with trains serving Kettering and a little later Corby, was linked  in 1867 to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]].

==Geography==
===Geology===
The town is sited on the hills adjoining the flood plain of the River Nene.<ref name="Geology">[http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/planning/planapps/Documents/PDF%20Documents/Minerals%20and%20Waste%20Apps/15%20Chelveston%20-%20Northants%20Landscape%20Character%20Assessment%20XV%20(PDF%20Format%203.29MB).pdf Northamptonshire flood plains] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref><ref>[http://localplan.wellingborough.gov.uk/map.asp?Command=SETZOOM&Scale=2500&Left=490262.730049701&Top=268516.219584525&Right=490686.063154434&Bottom=268198.719755975&p1=on&p2=on&p3=on&p4=on&p5=on&p6=on&p7=on&p8=on&p9=on&p10=on&p11=on&p12=on&p13=on&p14=on&p15=on&p16=on&p17=on&p18=on&p19=on&p20=on&p21=on&p22=on&p23=on&p24=on&p25=on&p26=on&p27=on&p28=on&p29=on&p30=on&p31=on Wellingborough Geology Map] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref> In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils seems to have been good for a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with [[Till|boulder clay]] or glacial [[till]] during the recent glaciations.<ref>[http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/downloads/file/878/appendix_18_geology  Borough Council of Wellingborough: Northamptonshire Geology] Retrieved 11 June 2010</ref> On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.

===Iron ore===

The most economically important aspect of the geology of the area is the [[Northampton Sand]]s [[ironstone]] formation. This is a marine sand of [[Jurassic]] age ([[Bajocian]] stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals giving an average ore grade of around 25 [[Concentration#Mass percentage (fraction)|wt%]] iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steel making process and the "[[basic slag]]" smelting chemistry, which combine to make high quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the UK in the run-up to [[World War II]], being the best developed bulk iron producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional [[dip slope|dip]] of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.<ref>[http://www.brixworth.demon.co.uk/northgeo.jpg Northants Geology Map] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref><ref>[ Northamptonshire Jurassic age] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brixworth.demon.co.uk/northgeo.htm |title=The Geology of Northamptonshire |author=Mike Lewis |date= |work= |publisher=  Department of Geography and Geology, Northamptonshire Grammar School|accessdate=17 June 2010}}</ref>

==Demography==
Wellingborough's population expanded rapidly from 26,000 to 60,000 in the 1960s and 1970s as agreements were signed between the Urban District Council and [[London County Council]] and the [[Greater London Council]] for the town to re-house over-spill population from London. Following the post [[World War II]] arrival of immigrants from the Commonwealth group of nations into Britain, a sizeable [[Black Caribbean]] and [[demographics of India|Indian]]/[[Pakistani]] community grew up in this small market town, and now represents  7% of the population in the Borough and to 11% within the town.<ref name="wellingborough.gov.uk">[http://www.wellingborough.gov.uk/info/349/business_advice/249/invest_in_wellingborough/6 The Borough Council of Wellingborough: Population] Retrieved 23 August 2009</ref>

;Future developments

As part of its Milton Keynes [[South Midlands]] (MKSM) study, the government has identified Wellingborough as one of several towns in Northamptonshire into which growth will be directed over the next thirty years. It allocates 12,800 additional homes to Wellingborough, and will also create additional facilities, further improve the town centre, improve infrastructure and increase employment opportunities. A jobs growth target of 12,400 jobs has been set to accompany the large scale housing growth.<ref name="NNDC">[http://www.nndev.co.uk/ North Northants Development Company] Retrieved 28 January 2010</ref> A plan for 3,000 homes north of the town has been accepted by the UK Government after an appeal by Bee Bee Developments.
