'''Bedford Air Force Station (ADC ID: M-121, NORAD ID: Z-121)''' is a closed [[United States Air Force]] General Surveillance Radar station.  It is located {{convert|12.7|mi|km}}  north of [[Bedford, Virginia]].  It was closed in 1975.

==History==
Bedford AFS was established by [[Air Defense Command]] in 1954 as part of a planned deployment of forty-four Phase I Mobile Radar stations.  It was one of twenty-nine stations which were sited around the perimeter of the country to support the permanent ADC network of seventy-five stations.  The deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment  The 649th Airborne Control and Warning Squadron achieved beneficial occupancy by 1 December 1954. Operational status was achieved in 1956 with the activation of the [[AN/MPS-8]] and [[AN/MPS-11]] radars. 

By 1958 the AN/MPS-8 had been superseded by a pair of [[AN/FPS-6]] height-finder radars. In 1959 an [[AN/FPS-20]]A search radar replaced the AN/MPS-11 set.  In addition, Bedford AFS joined the [[SAGE system]] and the squadron was redesigated as the [[649th Radar Squadron]].

In 1960 this site also began performing air traffic control duties for the [[FAA]].  In 1963 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an [[AN/FPS-67]].  On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-121.  

The 649th was deactivated and the Air Force closed the facility on 30 June 1975.  Afterward the FAA took over the facility, and today it is an active [[Joint Surveillance System]] (JSS) site, now operating an [[ARSR-3]] Long Range Air Route Surveillance Radar.   Most of the buildings on the site have been torn down, the housing and GATR site have been obliterated as well.
