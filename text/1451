It began in February 2003 when the [[Sudan Liberation Movement/Army]] (SLM/A) and [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) rebel groups took up arms against the [[Government of Sudan]] which they accused of marginalizing Darfur's non-[[Arab]] population. The government responded to attacks by arming [[Janjaweed]] militias and carrying out a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] against non-Arabs in Darfur resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president [[Omar al-Bashir]] for [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]] by the [[International Criminal Court]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Copnall |first=James |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22336600 |title=BBC News <U+2013> Darfur conflict: Sudan's bloody stalemate |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/doc/doc931075.pdf |title="ICC-02/05-01/09: The Prosecutor v.

One side of the conflict was composed mainly of the official Sudanese military and police, and the [[Janjaweed]], a Sudanese [[militia]] group recruited mostly from the [[Arabization|Arabized]] indigenous Africans and few Arab [[Bedouin]] of the northern [[Rizeigat]]; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remain uninvolved in the conflict.<ref name="guardian2004">{{Cite news|author= de Waal, Alex |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2004/jul/25/internationalaidanddevelopment.voluntarysector |title=Darfur's Deep Grievances Defy All Hopes for An Easy Solution|work=The Observer|date= 25 July 2004|accessdate=13 January 2011 |authorlink= Alex de Waal |location=London}}</ref>
The other combatants are made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], and [[Masalit people|Masalit]] ethnic groups. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supports the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it has provided financial assistance and weapons to the militia as well as coordinated joint attacks,many against civilians, along with the group.<ref>{{cite news

There are various estimates on [[Darfur Genocide#Mortality figures|the number of human casualties]] which range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either direct combat or starvation and disease inflicted by the conflict. There have also been mass displacements and coercive migrations, forcing millions into refugee camps or over the border and creating a large [[humanitarian crisis]] and is regarded by many, like US Secretary of State Colin Powell, as either a genocide, or acts of genocide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Adam|title=Genocide A Comprehensive introduction|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=373}}</ref>

The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue further peace.

==Timeline==

===Origins of the conflict===
The conflict's origin goes back to land disputes between semi-nomadic livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture.<ref name="Genocide Debate 2005 pp. 123-133">Darfur and the Genocide Debate, Scott Straus, Foreign Affairs, Vol. 84, No. 1 (Jan. <U+2013> Feb. 2005), pp. 123<U+2013>133</ref>

Since the population of Darfur is predominantly Muslim, the conflict may not be only about race or religion, but about resources as the nomadic tribes facing drought are going after the territory of sedentary farmers.<ref>Bechtold, P. K. (2009). A History of Modern Sudan. Middle East Journal, 63(1), 149 <U+2013> 150.</ref>

====Arab Apartheid Allegation====
Some people contend that in the beginning of 1991, non-Arabs of the Zaghawa people of Sudan complained that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign.<ref>Hilde F. Johnson, Waging Peace in Sudan: The Inside Story of the Negotiations That Ended, Trans Pacific Press, 2011, p. 38.</ref> Sudanese Arabs, who control the government, are widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan's non-Arab citizens.<ref name="Lasaga">Vukoni Lupa Lasaga, "The slow, violent death of apartheid in Sudan," 19 September 2006, Norwegian Council for Africa.</ref> The government is accused of "deftly manipulat(ing) Arab solidarity" to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing against non-Arabs in Darfur.<ref name="Lasaga" />

[[American University]] economist [[George Ayittey]] accuses the Arab government of Sudan of practicing racist acts against black citizens.<ref>George Ayittey, Africa and China, [[The Economist]], 19 February 2010</ref> According to Ayittey, "In Sudan... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks <U+2013> Arab apartheid."<ref>"How the Multilateral Institutions Compounded Africa's Economic Crisis, George B.N. Ayittey; Law and Policy in International Business, Vol. 30, 1999.</ref> Many African commentators join Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid.<ref>Koigi wa Wamwere, Negative ethnicity: from bias to genocide, Seven Stories Press, 2003, p. 152.</ref><ref>George B.

Boston Globe columnist Fred Jacoby has accused Sudan of practicing apartheid against Christians in what is now South Sudan "where tens of thousands of black Africans in the country's southern region, most of them Christians or animists, have been abducted and sold into slavery by Arab militias backed by the Islamist regime in Khartoum."<ref>Jeff Jacoby, "UN's obsession is grotesque and Orwellian", 5 November 2008, Jewish World Review</ref><ref>Jeff Jacoby, "The UN's obsession with demonizing Israel," 30 November 2008, Boston Globe</ref>

[[Alan Dershowitz]] has pointed to Sudan as an example of a government that "actually deserve(s)" the appellation "apartheid."<ref>Alan Dershowitz, The Case Against Israel's Enemies: Exposing Jimmy Carter and Others Who Stand in the Way of Peace, John Wiley and Sons, 2009, p. 24.</ref> Other distinguished people who have accused the regime in Sudan of practising "apartheid" against non-Arabs include former Canadian Minister of Justice [[Irwin Cotler]].<ref>Hubert Bauch, "Ex-minister speaks out against Sudan's al-Bashir" Montreal Gazette, 6 March 2009.</ref>

The usage of the terms "Arab" and "Black" has been opposed, because all parties involved in the Darfur conflict<U+2014>whether they are referred to as 'Arab' (particularly [[Baggara]]/[[Janjaweed]]) or as 'African,<U+2019> are equally indigenous. The Janjaweed group recruited mostly from the [[Arabization|Arabized]] indigenous Africans/Baggara and few Arab [[Bedouin]] of the northern [[Rizeigat]]; while the majority of Arab groups in Darfur remain uninvolved in the conflict.<ref name="guardian2004" />

===Beginning of the conflict===
The beginning point of the conflict in the Darfur region is typically said to be 26 February 2003, when a group calling itself the [[Darfur Liberation Front]] (DLF) publicly claimed credit for an attack on [[Golo, Sudan|Golo]], the headquarters of [[Jebel Marra]] District.  Even prior to this attack, however, a conflict had erupted in Darfur, as rebels had already attacked police stations, army outposts and military convoys, and the government had engaged in a massive air and land assault on the rebel stronghold in the [[Marrah Mountains]].  The rebels' first military action was a successful attack on an army garrison on the mountain on 25 February 2002 and the Sudanese government had been aware of a unified rebel movement since an attack on the Golo police station in June 2002.  Chroniclers Julie Flint and [[Alex de Waal]] state that the beginning of the rebellion is better dated to 21 July 2001, when a group of [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] and [[Fur people|Fur]] met in [[Abu Gamra]] and swore oaths on the [[Qur'an]] to work together to defend against government-sponsored attacks on their villages.<ref>Julie Flint and [[Alex de Waal]], ''Darfur: A Short History of a Long War'', Zed Books, London March 2006, ISBN 1-84277-697-5, p. 76-77</ref> It should be noted that nearly all of the residents of Darfur are Muslim, including the [[Janjaweed]], as well as the government leaders in [[Khartoum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/dh/sudan/com_inq_darfur.pdf#search=%22un%20report%20darfur%20genocide%22 |title=Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to the United Nations Secretary-General (PDF)|publisher= United Nations |page=129 |date=25 January 2005 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

On 25 March 2003, the rebels seized the garrison town of [[Tine, Sudan|Tine]] along the Chadian border, seizing large quantities of supplies and arms.  Despite a threat by President [[Omar al-Bashir]] to "unleash" the army, the military had little in reserve.  The army was already deployed both to the south, where the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] was drawing to an end, and to the east, where [[Eastern Front (Sudan)|rebels]] sponsored by [[Eritrea]] were threatening a newly constructed pipeline from the central oilfields to [[Port Sudan]].  The rebel [[Guerilla warfare|guerilla tactic]] of hit-and-run raids to speed across the semi-desert region proved almost impossible for the army, untrained in desert operations, to counter.  However, its aerial bombardment of rebel positions on the mountain was devastating.<ref>Flint and de Waal, p. 99</ref>

At 5:30&nbsp;am on 25 April 2003, a joint [[Sudan Liberation Army]] (SLA) and [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) force in 33 [[Toyota Land Cruiser]]s entered [[al-Fashir]] and attacked the sleeping garrison. In the next four hours, four [[Antonov]] bombers and helicopter gunships (according to the government; seven according to the rebels) were destroyed on the ground, 75 soldiers, pilots and technicians were killed and 32 were captured, including the commander of the air base, a [[Major General]].  The success of the raid was unprecedented in Sudan; in the twenty years of the war in the south, the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA) had never carried out such an operation.<ref>Flint and de Waal, pp. 99<U+2013>100</ref>

===The Janjaweed enter the conflict (2003)===
[[Image:Darfur IDPs children sitting.jpg|thumb|[[Internally displaced person]]s' camp]]
The al-Fashir raid was a turning point both militarily and psychologically.  The armed forces had been humiliated by the al-Fashir raid and the government was faced with a difficult strategic situation.  The incompetent armed forces would clearly need to be retrained and redeployed to fight this new kind of war and there were well-founded concerns about the loyalty of the many Darfurian non-commissioned officers and soldiers in the army.  Responsibility for prosecuting the war was given to Sudanese military intelligence. Nevertheless, in the middle months of 2003, the rebels won 34 of 38 engagements.  In May, the SLA destroyed a battalion at [[Kutum]], killing 500 and taking 300 prisoners; and in mid-July, 250 were killed in a second attack on Tine.  The SLA began to infiltrate farther east, threatening to extend the war into [[Kordofan]].

However, at this point the government changed its strategy.  Given that the army was being consistently defeated, the war effort depended on three elements: military intelligence, the air force, and the [[Janjaweed]], armed [[Baggara]] herders whom the government had begun directing in suppression of a [[Masalit people|Masalit]] uprising in 1986<U+2013>1999.  The Janjaweed were put at the center of the new [[counter-insurgency]] strategy.  Though the government consistently denied supporting the Janjaweed, military resources were poured into Darfur and the Janjaweed were outfitted as a paramilitary force, complete with communication equipment and some artillery.  The military planners were doubtlessly aware of the probable consequences of such a strategy: similar methods undertaken in the [[Nuba Mountains]] and around the southern oil fields during the 1990s had resulted in massive human rights violations and [[forced displacement]]s.<ref>Flint and de Waal, pp. 60, 101<U+2013>103</ref>

The better-armed Janjaweed quickly gained the upper hand. By the spring of 2004, several thousand people <U+2013> mostly from the non-Arab population <U+2013> had been killed and as many as a million more had been driven from their homes, causing a major humanitarian crisis in the region. The crisis took on an international dimension when over 100,000 refugees poured into neighbouring [[Chad]], pursued by Janjaweed militiamen, who clashed with Chadian government forces along the border. More than 70 militiamen and 10 Chadian soldiers were killed in one gun battle in April. A United Nations observer team reported that non-Arab villages were singled out while Arab villages were left untouched:
[[Image:Villages destroyed in the Darfur Sudan 2AUG2004.jpg|thumb|Destroyed villages {{as of|2004|8|lc=on}}]]
<blockquote>The 23 Fur villages in the Shattaya Administrative Unit have been completely depopulated, looted and burnt to the ground (the team observed several such sites driving through the area for two days). Meanwhile, dotted alongside these charred locations are unharmed, populated and functioning Arab settlements. In some locations, the distance between a destroyed Fur village and an Arab village is less than 500 meters.<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/OCHA-64DKD6?OpenDocument United Nations Inter-Agency Fact Finding and Rapid Assessment Mission: Kailek Town, South Darfur], United Nations Resident Coordinator, 25 April 2004</ref></blockquote>

A 2011 study in the ''British Journal of Sociology'', "The Displaced and Dispossessed of Darfur: Explaining the Sources of a Continuing State-Led Genocide,<U+201D> examined 1,000 interviews with Black African participants who fled from 22 village clusters in Darfur to various refugee camps in 2003 and 2004. The study found that: 1) The frequency of hearing racial epithets during an attack was 70% higher when it was led by the Janjaweed alone compared to official police forces; it was 80% higher when the Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government attacked together; 2) Risk of displacement was nearly 110% higher during a joint attack compared to when the police or Janjaweed acted alone, and 85% higher when Janjaweed forces attacked alone compared to when the attack was only perpetrated by the Sudanese Government forces; 3) Attacks on food and water supplies made it 129% more likely for inhabitants to be displaced compared to attacks that involved house burnings or killing of persons; 4) Perpetrators knew and took <U+201C>special advantage<U+201D> of the susceptibility of Darfur residents to attacks focused on basic resources. This vulnerability came against the backdrop of increased regional desertification.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/darfur-sources-genocide/ |title = Displaced and Dispossessed of Darfur: Explaining Sources of Genocide |publisher = Journalist's Resource}}</ref>

===2004<U+2013>2005===
In 2004, Chad brokered negotiations in [[N'Djamena]], leading to the [[April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement]] between the Sudanese government, the JEM, and the SLA.  One group which did not participate in the April cease-fire talks or agreement <U+2013> the [[National Movement for Reform and Development]] <U+2014> splintered from the JEM in April. Janjaweed and rebel attacks continued despite the ceasefire, and the [[African Union]] (AU) formed a [[Ceasefire Commission]] (CFC) to monitor its observance.

In August, the African Union sent 150 [[Rwanda]]n troops in to protect the ceasefire monitors. It, however, soon became apparent that 150 troops would not be enough, so they were joined by 150 [[Nigeria]]n troops.

On 18 September, the United Nations Security Council issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564|Resolution 1564]] declaring that the government of Sudan had not met its commitments and expressing concern at helicopter attacks and assaults by the Janjaweed militia against villages in Darfur. It welcomed the intention of the African Union to enhance its monitoring mission in Darfur and urged all member states to support such efforts.

During April 2005, after the government of Sudan signed a ceasefire agreement with [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] which led to the end of the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], the [[African Union Mission in Sudan]] force was increased by 600 troops and 80 military observers. In July, the force was increased by about 3,300 (with a budget of 220 million dollars). In April 2005, AMIS was increased to about 7,000.

The scale of the crisis led to warnings of an imminent disaster, with [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] warning that the risk of genocide was frighteningly real in Darfur. The scale of the Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the [[Rwandan Genocide]], a parallel hotly denied by the Sudanese government. Independent observers noted that the tactics, which included dismemberment and killing of noncombatants and even young children and babies, were more akin to the [[ethnic cleansing]] used in the [[Yugoslav wars]] and warned that the region's remoteness meant that hundreds of thousands of people were effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based [[International Crisis Group]] had reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of [[starvation]] and disease.<ref name="'Dozens killed'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3741875.stm 'Dozens killed' in Sudan attack] (BBC) 24 May 2004</ref>
[[Image:Rwandan Soldiers airlifted to Darfur 17july2005.jpg|right|thumb|229px|AMIS soldiers from [[Rwanda]] preparing to depart to Darfur in 2005.]]

On 10 July 2005, Ex-SPLA leader [[John Garang]] was sworn in as Sudan's vice-president.<ref name="ex-rebel joins government">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4666701.stm  Sudan ex-rebel joins government] (BBC) 10 July 2005</ref> However, on 30 July, Garang died in a helicopter crash.<ref name="garang killed">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4733571.stm Sudan VP Garang killed in crash] (BBC) 1 August 2005</ref> His death had long-term implications and, despite improved security, talks between the various rebels in the Darfur region progressed slowly.

An attack on the Chadian town of [[Adr<U+00E9>]] near the Sudanese border led to the deaths of three hundred rebels in December. Sudan was blamed for the attack, which was the second in the region in three days.<ref name="Chad fightback">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4544352.stm Chad fightback 'kills 300 rebels'] (BBC) 20 December 2005</ref> The escalating tensions in the region led to the [[government of Chad]] declaring its hostility toward Sudan and calling for Chadian citizens to mobilise themselves against the "common enemy".<ref name="Chad in 'state of war'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4556576.stm Chad in 'state of war' with Sudan] By Stephanie Hancock, BBC News, [[N'Djamena]], 23 December 2005</ref> (See [[Chad-Sudan conflict]])

===July<U+2013>August 2006===
July and August 2006 saw renewed fighting, with international aid organizations considering leaving due to attacks against their personnel.

===Implementation (September 2006)===
On 8 September, [[Ant<U+00F3>nio Guterres]], head of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], said Darfur faced a "humanitarian catastrophe".<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-09-08T090839Z_01_L0866016_RTRUKOC_0_US-SUDAN-DARFUR-REFUGEES.xml&archived=False "U.N. refugee chief warns of Darfur "catastrophe"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 8 September 2006</ref> On 12 September, Sudan's [[European Union]] envoy Pekka Haavisto claimed that the Sudanese army was "bombing civilians in Darfur".<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12836278.htm "Sudan bombing civilians in Darfur <U+2013> EU envoy"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 12 September 2006</ref> A [[World Food Programme]] official reported that food aid had been cut off from at least 355,000 people in the region.<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200609/12/eng20060912_302059.html "Violence in Darfur cuts off 355,000 people from food aid"], ''[[People's Daily]]'', 12 September 2006</ref> Kofi Annan told the UNSC that "the tragedy in Darfur has reached a critical moment.

On 14 September, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, [[Minni Minnawi]], stated that he did not object to the UN peacekeeping force, in opposition to the Sudanese government's view that such a deployment would be an act of Western invasion. Minnawi claimed that the AU force "can do nothing because the AU mandate is very limited".<ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14903230.htm "Ex-rebels says would accept UN in Darfur"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 14 September 2006</ref> Khartoum remained sternly against the UN's involvement, with Sudanese president Al-Bashir depicting it as a colonial plan and stating that "we do not want Sudan to turn into [[Iraq War|another Iraq]]."<ref>[http://www.kuna.net.kw/home/story.aspx?Language=en&DSNO=907164 "We don't want Sudan to turn into "another Iraq" in the region <U+2013> al-Bashir"], ''[[Kuwait News Agency]]'', 21 September 2006</ref>

===Deterioration (October<U+2013>November 2006)===
On 2 October, with the UN force plan suspended indefinitely because of Sudanese opposition, the AU announced that it would extend its presence in the region until 31 December 2006.<ref name="r1">[http://www.deepikaglobal.com/ENG4_sub.asp?ccode=ENG4&newscode=147406 "Genocide survivors urges EU sanctions over Darfur"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 20 October 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L0285506.htm "AU will not abandon Darfur <U+2013> AU chairman"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 2 October 2006</ref> Two hundred UN troops were sent to reinforce the AU force.<ref>[http://torontosun.com/News/World/2006/10/10/1992164-sun.html "200 UN troops to deploy in Darfur"], ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', 10 October 2006</ref> On 6 October, the UNSC voted to extend the mandate of the [[United Nations Mission in Sudan]] until 30 April 2007.<ref>[http://www.upi.com/InternationalIntelligence/view.php?StoryID=20061006-063151-8650r "Extend Sudan U.N. mission"], ''[[United Press International]]'', 9 October 2006</ref> On 9 October, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] listed Darfur as the most pressing food emergency out of the forty countries listed on its ''Crop Prospects and Food Situation'' report.<ref>[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20176&Cr=&Cr1=Food "Forty countries face food shortages, Darfur crisis is the most pressing: UN agency"], ''United Nations'', 9 October 2006</ref> On 10 October, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, [[Louise Arbour]], claimed that the Sudanese government had prior knowledge of attacks by Janjaweed militias in Buram, [[South Darfur]] the month before, an attack which saw hundreds of civilians killed.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1891572,00.html "UN official: Khartoum knew of Darfur militia raid"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 10 October 2006</ref>

[[Image:Darfur report - Page 7 Image 1.jpg|thumb|Children in the camps are encouraged to confront their psychological scars. The clay figures depict an attack by [[Janjaweed]].]]
On 12 October, Nigerian Foreign Minister [[Joy Ogwu]] arrived in Darfur for a two-day visit. She urged the Sudanese government to accept a UN formula. Speaking in [[Ethiopia]], Nigerian President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] spoke against "stand[ing] by and see[ing] genocide being developed in Darfur."<ref>[http://english.people.com.cn/200610/12/eng20061012_311117.html "Nigerian FM arrives in Khartoum for talks on Darfur"], ''[[People's Daily]]'', 12 October 2006</ref> On 13 October, US President [[George W. Bush]] imposed further sanctions against those deemed complicit in the Darfur atrocities under the ''[[Darfur Peace and Accountability Act]] of 2006''. The measures were said to strengthen existing sanctions by prohibiting US citizens from engaging in oil-related transactions with Sudan (although US companies had been prohibited from doing any business with Sudan since 1997), freezing the assets of complicit parties and denying them entry to the US.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/13/AR2006101301464.html "Bush signs law setting sanctions on Darfur crimes"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 13 October 2006</ref>

The AU mission's lack of funding and equipment meant that aid workers' work in Darfur was severely limited by fighting. Some warned that the humanitarian situation could deteriorate to levels seen in 2003 and 2004, when UN officials called Darfur the world's worst humanitarian crisis.<ref name="r1" />

On 22 October, the Sudanese government told UN envoy [[Jan Pronk]] to leave the country within three days. Pronk, the senior UN official in the country, had been heavily criticized by the army after he posted a description of several recent military defeats in Darfur to his personal blog.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6074808.stm "UN envoy is told to leave Sudan"], BBC News, 22 October 2006</ref> On 1 November, the US announced that it would formulate an international plan which it hoped the Sudanese government would find more palatable.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=N01464930 "U.S. works on international plan for Darfur"], ''[[Reuters]]'', 1 November 2006</ref> On 9 November, senior Sudanese presidential advisor Nafie Ali Nafie told reporters that his government was prepared to start unconditional talks with the [[National Redemption Front]] (NRF) rebel alliance, but noted he saw little use for a new peace agreement. The NRF, which had rejected the May Agreement and sought a new peace agreement, did not issue a comment.<ref>[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=worldNews&storyID=2006-11-09T105555Z_01_L09311339_RTRUKOC_0_US-SUDAN-DARFUR.xml&WTmodLoc=IntNewsHome_C2_worldNews-7 "Sudan says ready for talks with Darfur's NRF rebels"], ''[[Reuters]], 9 November 2006</ref>

In late 2006, Darfur Arabs started their own rebel group, the Popular Forces Troops, and announced on 6 December that they had repulsed an assault by the Sudanese army at Kas-Zallingi the previous day. In a statement, they called the Janjaweed mercenaries who did not represent Darfur's Arabs. They were the latest of numerous Darfur Arab groups to have announced their opposition to the government's war since 2003, some of which had signed political accords with rebel movements.

The same period saw an example of a tribe-based split within the Arab forces, when relations between the farming [[Terjem]] and nomadic, camel-herding [[Mahria]] tribes became tense. Terjem leaders accused the Mahria of kidnapping a Terjem boy, and Mahria leaders said the Terjem had been stealing their animals. Ali Mahamoud Mohammed, the wali, or governor, of South Darfur, said the fighting began in December when the Mahria drove their camels south in a seasonal migration, trampling through Terjem territory near the [[Bulbul River]]. Fighting would resume in July 2007.<ref name="jg9307">gettleman, Jeffrey, "Chaos in Darfur on rise as Arabs fight with Arabs", news article, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 3 September 2007, pp 1, A7</ref>

Also on 18 November, the AU reported that Sudanese military and Sudanese-backed militias had launched a ground and air operation in the region which resulted in about 70 civilian deaths. The AU stated that this "was a flagrant violation of security agreements".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6161692.stm "Sudan 'begins new Darfur attacks'"], ''[[BBC News]]'', 18 November 2006</ref>

On 25 November, a spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights accused the Sudanese government of having committed "a deliberate and unprovoked attack" against civilians in the town of Sirba on 11 November, which claimed the lives of at least 30 people. The Commissioner's statement maintained that "contrary to the government<U+2019>s claim, it appears that the Sudanese Armed Forces launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on civilians and their property in Sirba," and that this also involved "extensive and wanton destruction and looting of civilian property".<ref>[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article18893 "Army attack against Darfur civilians was unprovoked <U+2013> UN"], ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'', 25 November 2006</ref>

According to the [[Save Darfur Coalition]], [[New Mexico]] [[Bill Richardson|Governor Bill Richardson]] and President [[Omar al-Bashir|al-Bashir]] have agreed to a cease-fire whereby the Sudanese "government and rebel groups will cease hostilities for a period of 60 days while they work towards a lasting peace."<ref>[http://www.savedarfur.org/newsroom/releases/cease_fire_agreement_offers_a_moment_of_opportunity_for_political_settlemen Cease-Fire Agreement Offers a Moment of Opportunity for Political Settlement in Worsening Darfur Cri |Save Darfur]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref> In addition, the Save Darfur press release stated that the agreement "included a number of concessions to improve humanitarian aid and media access to Darfur."

The violence has spread over the border to [[Chad]]. On 31 March 2007 Janjaweed militiamen killed up to 400 people in the volatile eastern border region of Chad near Sudan. The attack took place in the border villages of Tiero and Marena. The villages were encircled and then fired upon. Fleeing villagers were later subsequently chased. The women were robbed and the men shot according to the [[UNHCR]]. There were many who, despite surviving the initial attack, ended up dying due to exhaustion and dehydration, often while fleeing.<ref>{{cite news

Sudan's humanitarian affairs minister, [[Ahmed Haroun]], and a Janjaweed militia leader, known as [[Ali Kushayb]], have been charged by the [[International Criminal Court]] with 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

</ref> The accord was brokered by Saudi Arabia. It sought to guarantee that each country would not be used to harbor, train or fund armed movements opposed to the government of the other. The Reuters News Service reported that "Deby's fears that [[Mahamat Nouri|Nouri]]'s UFDD may have been receiving Saudi as well as Sudanese support could have pushed him to sign the Saudi-mediated pact with Bashir on Thursday". Colin Thomas-Jensen, an expert on Chad and Darfur who works International Crisis Group think-tank has grave doubts as to whether "this new deal will lead to any genuine thaw in relations or improvement in the security situation". Additionally The Chadian rebel Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD) which has fought a hit-and-run war against Chad President Deby's forces in east Chad since 2006 stated that the Saudi-backed peace deal would not stop its military campaign. Thus the agreement may end up hurting the Sudanese rebels the most, leaving the Sudanese government with a freer hand.<ref>{{cite news

===June 2007===
[[Oxfam]] announced on 17 June that it is permanently pulling out of Gereida, the largest camp in Darfur, where more than 130,000 have sought refuge. The agency cited inaction by local authorities from the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM), which controls the region, in addressing security concerns and violence against aid workers. An employee of the [[Non Governmental Organization|NGO]] [[Action by Churches Together]] was murdered in June in West Darfur. There have been ongoing hijackings of vehicles belonging to the UN and other international organizations<U+2014>something that is also making them think twice about staying in the region.<ref>{{cite news

[[BBC News]] reported that a huge underground lake has been found in the Darfur region.

A 14 July 2007 article notes that in the past two months up to 75,000 Arabs from [[Chad]] and [[Niger]] crossed the border into Darfur.

The hybrid UN/AU force was finally approved on 31 July 2007 with the unanimously approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769]].

On 31 July, the ongoing conflict between the Terjem and the Mahria tribes (former partners in the Janjaweed) heated up, with Mahria gunmen surrounding mourners at the funeral of an important Terjem sheik and killing 60 with [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s (RPGs) and belt-fed [[machine guns]].<ref name="jg9307" />

From 3 August 2007 until 5 August 2007, a conference was held in [[Arusha]], Tanzania, to unite the different existing rebel groups to make the subsequent peace negotiations with the [[government of Sudan]] more streamlined.

In the several months up through August, Arab tribes that had worked together in the Janjaweed militia began falling out among themselves, and even further splintered into factions. Terjem fought Mahria as thousands of gunmen from each side traveled hundreds of miles to fight in the strategic Bulbul river valley. Farther south, Habanniya and Salamat tribes clashed. The fighting did not result in as much killing as in 2003 and 2004, the height of the violence. United Nations officials said the groups might be trying to seize land before U.N. and African Union peacekeepers arrived.<ref name="jg9307" />

Peace talks started on 27 October 2007 in [[Sirte]], Libya. The following groups attended the talks:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article24453 |title=FACTBOX-Who is attending Darfur talks, who is not |publisher=SudanTribune article }}</ref>

* Justice and Equality Movement splinters:
** Justice and Equality Movement<U+2013>Collective Leadership, led by [[Bahr Idriss Abu Garda]]
** Justice and Equality Movement<U+2013>Azraq, led by Idriss Ibrahim Azraq
** [[National Movement for Reform and Development]], led by Khalil Abdullah
* Revolutionary Democratic Forces Front, led by Salah Abu Surrah
* United Revolutionary Force Front, led by Alhadi Agabeldour
* Sudan Liberation Movement<U+2013>G19, led by [[Khamees Abdullah]]
* Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance, led by Ahmed Ibrahim Diraige

The following groups didn't attend:

* [[Justice and Equality Movement]], led by Khalil Ibrahim; they object to the presence of rebel groups they say had no constituency and no place at the table.
* Sudan Liberation Movement (Abdel Wahed), led by Abdel Wahed Mohamed el-Nur; the group has few forces, but its leader is highly respected; refused to attend until a force was deployed to stem the Darfur violence.
* Sudan Liberation Movement<U+2013>Unity, originally led by Abdallah Yehya, includes many other prominent figures (Sherif Harir, Abu Bakr Kadu, Ahmed Kubur); the group with the largest number of rebel fighters; object for the same reason as JEM.
* Ahmed Abdel Shafi, a notable rebel enjoying strong support from the [[Fur tribe]].

Faced with a boycott from the most important rebel factions, the talks were rebranded as an "advanced consultation phase", with actual talks likely to start in November or December.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7066792.stm |work=BBC News | title=Struggle to salvage Darfur talks | date=29 October 2007 | accessdate=25 May 2010}}</ref>

===May 2008===
{{main|2008 invasion of Khartoum and Omdurman}}
On 10 May 2008 [[Sudan]]ese government soldiers and [[Darfur]] rebels clashed in the city of [[Omdurman]], opposite the capital of [[Khartoum]], over the control of a military headquarters.<ref>[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27076 Curfew in capital as Sudanese army clash near Khartoum with Darfur rebels], ''[[Sudan Tribune]]'' 10 May 2008</ref> They also raided a police base from which they stole police vehicles. A Sudanese police spokesperson said that the leader of the assailants, Mohamed Saleh Garbo, and his intelligence chief, Mohamed Nur Al-Deen, were killed in the clash.

Witnesses said that heavy gunfire could be heard in the west of Sudan's capital. Sudanese troops backed by tanks, artillery, and helicopter gunships were immediately deployed to Omdurman, and fighting raged for several hours. After seizing the strategic military airbase at Wadi-Sayedna, the Sudanese soldiers eventually defeated the rebels. A JEM force headed to the Al-Ingaz bridge to cross the [[White Nile]] into Khartoum, but was repulsed forces. By late afternoon, Sudanese TV claimed that the rebels had been "completely repulsed", while showing live images of burnt vehicles and corpses on the streets.<ref>[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article27077 Photos: Sudan capital after today's attack from Darfur JEM], ''Sudan Tribune'' 10 May 2008</ref>

The government imposed a curfew in Khartoum from 5&nbsp;pm to 6&nbsp;am, and aid agencies told their workers living in the capital to stay indoors.

Some 93 soldiers and 13 policemen were killed along with 30 civilians in the attack on Khartoum and Omdurman. Sudanese forces confirmed that they found the bodies of 90 rebels and had spotted dozens more strewn outside the city limits. While Sudanese authorities claimed that up to 400 rebels could have been killed, the rebels stated that they lost 45 fighters dead or wounded. Sudanese authorities also claimed to have destroyed 40 rebel vehicles and captured 17.

===August 2009===
General Martin Agwai, head of the joint African Union-United Nations mission in Darfur, said the war was over in the region, although low-level disputes remain. There is still "Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that," he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8224424.stm |title=War in Sudan's Darfur 'is over' |publisher=BBC News |date=27 August 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>

===Doha peace forum (December 2010 to September 2012)===
In December 2010, representatives of the [[Liberation and Justice Movement]], an umbrella organisation of ten rebel groups formed in February 2010,<ref>[http://www.sudantribune.com/EXCLUSIVE-Darfur-new-rebel-group,34301 ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref> started a fresh round of talks with the Sudanese Government in [[Doha]], Qatar.

In January 2011, the leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement, Dr. [[Tijani Sese]], stated that the movement had accepted the core proposals of the Darfur peace document proposed by the joint-mediators in Doha. The proposals included a $300,000,000 compensation package for victims of atrocities in Darfur and special courts to conduct trials of persons accused of human rights violations. Proposals for a new Darfur Regional Authority were also included, this authority would have an executive council of 18 ministers and would remain in place for five years. The current three Darfur states and state governments would also continue to exist during this period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://195.190.28.213/node/7950 |title=Radiodabanga.org |publisher=195.190.28.213 |date=9 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1609145.php/Alliance-of-rebel-factions-agrees-to-Darfur-peace-deal</ref> In February, the Sudanese Government rejected the idea of a single region headed by a vice-president from the region.<ref>http://www.shrig.org.sd/news-archive/darfur-news/2744-office-of-vp-must-meet-national-standards-says-el-haj-adam.html</ref>

On 29 January, the leaders of the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Doha negotiations and intention to attend the Doha forum on 5 February. The Sudanese government postponed deciding whether to attend the forum on that date due to beliefs that an internal peace process without the involvement of rebel groups might be possible.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stephen Kinzer |url=http://www.sudanjem.com/2009/archives/42241/en/ |title=End human rights imperialism now |publisher=Sudanjem.com |date=24 January 2010 |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref> Later in February, the Sudanese Government agreed to return to the Doha peace forum with a view to complete a new peace agreement by the end of that month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://195.190.28.213/node/9451 |title=Radiodabanga.org |publisher=195.190.28.213 }}</ref> On 25 February, both the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha.

On 9 March, it was announced that two more states would be established in Darfur: [[Central Darfur]] around [[Zalingei]] and [[Eastern Darfur]] around [[Ed Daein]]. The rebel groups protested and stated that this was a bid to further divide Darfur's influence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE7270CL20110308?sp=true | work=Reuters | title=Darfur to be cut into smaller states; rebel protest | date=8 March 2011}}</ref>

Advising both the LJM and JEM during the Doha peace negotiations was the [[Public International Law & Policy Group]] (PILPG). Led by Dr. [[Paul Williams (professor)|Paul Williams]] and [[Matthew T. Simpson]], PILPG's team provided on the ground legal support with regard to the substantive issues in the peace process.

In June, a new [[Darfur Peace Agreement (2011)]] was proposed by the Joint Mediators at the Doha Peace Forum. This agreement was to supersede the [[Darfur Peace Agreement#Abuja Agreement (2006)|Abuja Agreement]] of 2005 and when signed, would halt preparations for a Darfur status referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiodabanga.org/node/14852 |title=Under peace deal, Sudan would halt prep for Darfur Referendum |publisher=Radio Dabanga }}</ref> The proposed document included provisions for a Darfuri Vice-President and an administrative structure that includes both three [[States of Sudan|states]] and a strategic regional authority, the [[Darfur Regional Authority]], to oversee Darfur as a whole.<ref>http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/DPA-_Doha_draft.pdf</ref> The agreement was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement on 14 July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Sudan-and-LJM-rebels-sign-a-Darfur,39539 |title=Sudan and LJM rebels sign a Darfur peace agreement in Doha <U+2013> Sudan Tribune: Plural news and views on Sudan |publisher=Sudan Tribune }}</ref>

==Mortality figures==

Sudanese authorities claim a death toll of roughly 10,000 civilians.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMU9_nxHnfBspo342jYG0nXyx7-gD91TRRCO0 Sudan president charged with genocide in Darfur], ''[[Associated Press]]''.{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref>

In September 2004, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to [[starvation]]. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence.<ref name="How many have died">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4268733.stm How many have died in Darfur?] By Russell Smith (BBC) 16 February 2005</ref> A more recent British Parliamentary Report has estimated that over 300,000 people have died,<ref name="death toll may be 300,000">[http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L30582172.htm Darfur death toll may be 300,000, say UK lawmakers] (Reuters), 30 March 2005</ref> and others have estimated even more.

In May 2005, the [[Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters]] (CRED) of the School of Public Health of the [[Universit<U+00E9> catholique de Louvain]] in Brussels, Belgium published an analysis of mortality in Darfur. Their estimate stated that from September 2003 to January 2005, between 98,000 and 181,000 persons had died in Darfur, including 63,000 to 146,000 excess deaths.<ref name="Darfur: Counting the Deaths: Mortality Estimates from Multiple Survey Data">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedat.be/sites/default/files/ID%20214%20-%20Counting%20the%20death%20(2).pdf |title=Microsoft Word <U+2013> Letters9 |format=PDF |accessdate=24 March 2010}}</ref>

On 28 April 2006, Dr. Eric Reeves argued that "extant data, in aggregate, strongly suggest that total excess mortality in Darfur, over the course of more than three years of deadly conflict, now significantly exceeds 450,000," but this has not been independently verified.<ref name="Quantifying Genocide in Darfur">[http://www.sudanreeves.org/Article102.html Quantifying Genocide in Darfur] Dr. [[Eric Reeves]], 28 April 2006</ref>

==International response==
{{Main|International response to the Darfur conflict}}
International attention to the Darfur conflict largely began with reports by the advocacy organizations Amnesty International in July 2003 and the [[International Crisis Group]] in December 2003. However, widespread media coverage did not start until the outgoing United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, [[Mukesh Kapila]], called Darfur the "world's greatest humanitarian crisis" in March 2004.<ref name="Prunier1">Prunier, pp. 124<U+2013>148</ref> Organizations such as [[STAND: A Student Anti-Genocide Coalition]], later under the umbrella of [[Genocide Intervention Network]], and the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] emerged and became particularly active in the areas of engaging the United States Congress and President on the issue and pushing for divestment nationwide, initially launched by [[Adam Sterling]] under the auspice of the Sudan Divestment Task Force. Particularly strong advocates have additionally included: ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Nicholas Kristof]], Sudan scholar [[Eric Reeves]], Enough Project founder [[John Prendergast (activist)|John Prendergast]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Samantha Power]], photographers [[Ryan Spencer Reed]], former [[USMC|Marine]] [[Brian Steidle]], actress [[Mia Farrow]] and her son [[Ronan Farrow]], Olympian [[Joey Cheek]], actress [[Angelina Jolie]], actors [[George Clooney]], and [[Don Cheadle]], actor [[Jonah Hill]], actress [[Salma Hayek]], [[Save Darfur Coalition]]'s David Rubenstein, [[Slovenia]]n humanitarian Tomo Kriznar, and all of those involved with the [[Genocide Intervention Network]].  A movement advocating for [[humanitarian intervention]] has emerged in several countries.

===International Criminal Court===
In March 2005, the Security Council formally referred the situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, taking into account the report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, authorized by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564|UN Security Council Resolution 1564]] of 2004, but without mentioning any specific crimes.<ref>{{PDFlink|[http://web.archive.org/web/20080625002301/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/cases/N0529273.darfureferral.eng.pdf Security Council Resolution 1593 (2005)]|24.8&nbsp;KB}}</ref> Two permanent members of the Security Council, the United States and [[People's Republic of China|China]], abstained from the vote on the referral resolution.<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8351.doc.htm Security Council Refers Situation in Darfur, Sudan, to Prosecutor of International Criminal Court], UN Press Release SC/8351, 31 March 2005</ref>

In April 2007, the Judges of the ICC issued arrest warrants against the former Minister of State for the Interior, [[Ahmed Haroun]], and a Janjaweed leader, [[Ali Kushayb]], for crimes against humanity and war crimes.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080813022926/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/ICC-OTP-ST20080605-ENG.pdf]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}} [http://www.icc-cpi.int/ International Criminal Court], 5 June 2008</ref> The Sudan Government said that the ICC had no jurisdiction to try Sudanese citizens and that it would not hand the two men over to authorities in the Hague.<ref>Staff.

On 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor filed ten charges of war crimes against Sudan's incumbent President [[Omar al-Bashir]], three counts of genocide, five of crimes against humanity and two of murder. The Prosecutor has claimed that Mr. al-Bashir "masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their ethnicity. Leaders from three Darfur tribes are suing ICC prosecutor Luis-Moreno Ocampo for libel, defamation, and igniting hatred and tribalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/english/news/2008-09/14/03.shtml |title=IslamOnline.net- News |publisher=Islamonline|date=14 September 2008 / Ramadan 14, 1429|accessdate=2 October 2008}}</ref>

After an arrest warrant was issued for the Sudanese president in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to have the genocide charges added. However, the Pre-Trial Chamber found that there was no reasonable ground to support the contention that he had a specific intent to commit genocide (''dolus specialis''), which is an intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a protected group. The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. On 3 February 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the Pre-Trial Chamber had applied "an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor" and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to review based on the correct legal standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6670DB89-C6FF-45D4-8936-FF3F228FD961.htm |title=Judgment on Appeal |publisher=International Criminal Court |date=3 February 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110616090621/http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/6670DB89-C6FF-45D4-8936-FF3F228FD961.htm|archivedate=16 June 2011}}</ref> In July 2010, [[Sudan]]'s president [[Omar al-Bashir]] was finally charged by Hague for orchestrating Darfur genocide, three counts of genocide in Darfur by the [[International Criminal Court]].

This hardware has been transferred to Darfur for use by the government and the Janjaweed(Arab) militias and thus violating a UN arms embargo against Darfur. In its report it showed a photo of [[Nanchang Q-5|Chinese-made Fantan fighters]] that have been seen at [[Nyala, Sudan|Nyala]], Darfur and a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Antonov-26]] aircraft (painted white). The report provided evidence (including eyewitness testimony) that the Sudan Air Force has been conducting a pattern of indiscriminate aerial bombings of villages in Darfur and eastern Chad, a country not officially a part of the conflict using ground attack jet fighters and Antonov planes. The report contained an image of a Russian made [[Mi-24]] attack helicopter (reg. n<U+00B0> 928) at Nyala airport in Darfur, Sudan in March 2007. For several years the Sudan Air Force has used this type of attack helicopter for operations during Janjaweed attacks on villages in Darfur. The report also showed evidence that the government has been camouflaging military aircraft and helicopters by painting them white and in doing so, tried to cover up their military use by claiming that they were civilian in nature.  The white Antonov-26 aircraft was reported to have been used in Darfur in bombing missions.  Recently it has been confirmed by Airforces Monthly Magazine for June 2007, that China and Iran have financed and delivered "newer" aircraft for Sudan. The most recent additions have been 15<U+2013>20 Chinese A5 Fantan ground attack aircraft, which are actually quite obsolete. Also confirmed by Airforces Monthly is the use of Mil Mi-24 Hind gunships and [[Mil Mi-171]]Assault Helicopters. They have been photographed painted in UN markings and white color for disguised use in illegal attack missions into the Darfur Region. The base in which they have been seen is at Nyala Airport in the Darfur Region. 8 Hinds have been confirmed operating in the Darfur region. One An-26 transport has been also confirmed delivered from a Russian civil aviation corporation. This aircraft is modified with bomb racks, and painted in U.N. white for illegal bombing missions into Darfur. The aircraft serial 7705 is used, but actually confirmed as 26563. Training for Sudanese crew has recently been confirmed to have been conducted and ongoing at Dezful-Ardestani Air Base in southern Iran. China and Russia denied they had broken UN sanctions. China has a close relationship with Sudan and increased its military co-operation with the government in early 2007. Because of Sudan's plentiful supply of oil, China considers good relations with Sudan to be a strategic necessity that is needed to fuel its booming economy.<ref>{{cite news

===Criticism of international response===
[[Image:Save Darfur sign from New York .jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Save Darfur Coalition]] advocacy group coordinated a large rally in New York in April 2006]]

Tsim Al Bashir has sought the assistance of numerous non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him, he said- "From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Korea and Japan, even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong. We believe that the Chinese expansion was natural because it filled the space left by Western governments, the United States, and international funding agencies. The success of the Sudanese experiment in dealing with China without political conditions or pressures encouraged other African countries to look toward China."<ref>{{cite news |title=Omar al-Bashir Q&A: 'In Any War, Mistakes Happen on the Ground'|author=Sam Dealey|newspaper=TIME|date=14 August 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1916262-5,00.html|accessdate=9 March 2011}}</ref>

[[G<U+00E9>rard Prunier]], a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argued that the world's most powerful countries have largely limited themselves in expressing concerns and demand for the United Nations to take action in solving the genocide in Darfur. The UN, lacking both the funding and military support of the wealthy countries, has left the African Union to deploy a token force (AMIS) without a mandate to protect civilians. In the lack of foreign political will to address the political and economic structures that underlie the conflict, the [[international community]] has defined the Darfur conflict in humanitarian assistance terms and debated the label of "genocide."<ref name="Prunier1" />

On 16 October 2006, [[Minority Rights Group International|Minority Rights Group]] (MRG) published a critical report, challenging that the UN and the [[great power]]s could have prevented the deepening crisis in Darfur and that few lessons appear to have been drawn from their ineptitude during the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. MRG's executive director, Mark Lattimer, stated that: "this level of crisis, the killings, rape and displacement could have been foreseen and avoided ...

Amnesty International slammed Russia for breaking the UN arms embargo on Darfur, Russians sold weapons like [[Mi-24]] helicopters, [[Antonov 26]] planes, Russian weapons sales to Sudan totaled 21 million dollars. It was reported these weapons were used to slaughter Darfur civilians. The report said Russia "cannot have been unaware of reports of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the Sudanese security forces, But they have nevertheless continued to allow military equipment to be sent to Sudan." Russia was reported to "have been or should have been aware, several types of military equipment, including aircraft, have been deployed by the Sudanese armed forces for direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks in Darfur". The Russian planes were disguised as UN Planes which violate the Geneva Conventions. The Janjaweed also used Russian small arms to murder and loot, these Russian weapons spread into neighboring Chad. In 2005 helicopters from Russia were sold to Sudan for 7 million pounds sterling.
