The '''Aubert PA-20 Cigale''' ({{lang-en|[[Cicada]]}}), '''PA-204 Cigale Major''' and '''PA-205 Super Cigale''' were a family of high-wing cabin monoplanes built in [[France]] in the years immediately before and immediately after [[World War II]].  The original Cigale was shown at the 1938 [[Paris Salon]] but its development was interrupted by the War. The Cigale was a high-wing [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] of conventional configuration with fixed, [[Conventional landing gear|tailwheel undercarriage]].

==Development==
The original two-seat '''PA-20 Cigale''' first flew in 1938 powered by a [[Train 6T]]. Various refinements were made, including a change to a [[Renault 4Pei]] engine, and the aircraft was redesignated '''PA-201 Cigale'''. This original aircraft was destroyed during the course of World War II, but in 1945, Paul Aubert returned to the design, building another aircraft to the PA-201 standard. This went on to prove highly successful when flown competitively in 1945 and 1946. Aubert further modified his design into a four-seater, flying the '''PA-204 Cigale Major''' on 21 April 1947, and soon building a second example to this standard.

One of the PA-204s was subsequently re-engined first with a [[SNECMA 4L]] in 1951 ('''PA-204S'''), and then with a [[Lycoming O-290]]-D2B ('''PA-204L''') in 1955 and a [[Lycoming O-320]] in 1956 ('''PA-205 Super Cigale'''). With this engine, Aubert was finally satisfied with the design and built around thirty production examples, eight of which went to [[A<U+00E9>roclub Air France]].
