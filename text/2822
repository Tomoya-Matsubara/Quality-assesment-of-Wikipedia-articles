The '''Sabine River''' ({{pronEng|s<U+0259><U+02C8>bi<U+02D0>n}}) is a [[river]], 555 miles (893 km) long, in the [[U.S. states]] of [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. In its lower course, it forms part of the boundary between the two states and empties into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The river formed part of the [[United States]]-[[Mexico|Mexican]] international boundary during the early 19th century. The upper reaches of the river flow through the [[prairie]] country of northeast Texas. Along much of its lower reaches, it flows through [[pine]] forests along the Texas-Louisiana border, and the [[bayou]] country near the Gulf Coast. The river drains an area of 9,756 square miles (25,270 km<U+00B2>), of which 7,426 square miles (19,230 km<U+00B2>) is in Texas and the remainder in Louisiana. It flows through an area of abundant rainfall and discharges the largest volume of any river in Texas. The name Sabine ([[Spanish language|Sp]]: ''R<U+00ED>o de Sabinas'') comes from the Spanish word for [[Cupressaceae|cypress]], in reference to the extensive growth of such trees (here [[Bald cypress]]es) along the lower river. The river flows through an important [[petroleum]]-producing region, and the lower river near the Gulf is among the most industrialized areas of the southeastern United States.

The river was often described as the dividing line between the Old South and the New Southwest
==Description==
[[Image:SabineRiver.jpg|right|thumb|The Sabine River, in [[Orange, Texas]].]]The Sabine rises in northeast Texas by the union of three branches: the '''Cowleech Fork''', '''Caddo Fork''', and '''South Fork'''. The Cowleetch Fork rises in northwestern [[Hunt County, Texas|Hunt County]] and flows southeast for 35 miles (56 km). The Caddo Fork rises in two tributary forks, the East Caddo Fork and the West Caddo Fork, in northwestern Hunt County. The South Fork rises in the southwestern corner of Hunt County and flows east for 18 miles (29 km), joining the Caddo Fork and Cowleech Fork in southeastern Hunt County. The confluence of the forks is now submerged in the [[Lake Tawakoni]] reservoir. The combined river flows southeast across northeast Texas and is joined by a fourth branch, the '''Lake Fork''' 40 mi (64 km) downstream from the reservoir.

In northeast Texas, the river flows past [[Mineola, Texas|Mineola]], [[Gladewater, Texas|Gladewater]], and [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], the largest city on the river to southwest of [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] at the 32nd parallel, where it establishes the Texas-Louisiana boundary. It flows south, forming the state line for the remainder of its course. It is impounded 10 mi (16 km) west of [[Leesville, Louisiana]] to form the 70 mi (112 km) long [[Toledo Bend Reservoir]], with the [[Sabine National Forest]] along its western bank. South of the reservoir it passes through the [[bayou]] country, surrounded by [[wetland]]s, as well as widespread industrial areas near the Gulf Coast. Approximately 10 mi (15 km) south of [[Orange, Texas]], it meets the [[Neches River]] from the west to form the 17 mi (27 km) long and 7 mi (11 km) wide [[Sabine Lake]], which drains through [[Sabine Pass]] to the Gulf of Mexico. The city of [[Port Arthur, Texas]] sits along the western shore of Sabine Lake.

==History==

[[Archeology|Archeological]] evidence indicates the valley of the river was inhabited as far back as 12,000 years ago. Starting the 8th century  the [[Caddo]] inhabited the area, building extensive [[mound]]s. The Caddo culture flourished until the late 13th century, but remnants of the Caddo were living along the river when the first [[Europe|European]] explorers arrived in the 16th century. The river was given its name in 1716 by [[Domingo Ram<U+00F3>n]] and appeared as ''R<U+00ED>o de Sabinas'' on a 1721 map. The river was used by [[France|French]] traders, and at various times, the river was claimed by both [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and France. After the acquisition by Spain of the French territory of Louisiana in 1763, the capital of the Spanish province of Texas was established on the east side of the river, near present-day [[Robeline, Louisiana]]. 

The geography area remained one of the least understood in the region, with various Spanish maps containing errors in the naming of the Sabine and Neches, and sometimes showed them flowing independently into the Gulf of Mexico. After the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the [[United States]] in 1805, this indefinite nature of the boundary between the U.S. and Spain led to an agreement on [[November 6]], [[1806]], negotiated by Gen. [[James Wilkinson]] and Lt. Col. [[Sim<U+00F3>n de Herrera]], to establish a [[No Man's Land (Louisiana)|neutral territory]] on both sides of the river.

The indefinite boundary was resolved by the [[Adams-On<U+00ED>s Treaty]] of 1819, which established the river as the boundary from the Gulf to the 32nd parallel. The Spanish delay in the ratification of the treaty, as well as the 1821 independence of [[Mexico]], re-ignited the boundary dispute.  The United States claimed for a while that the names of the Sabine and Neches had been reversed, and thus claimed the treaty established the boundary at the Neches.  The first American settlers began arriving in the region in the 1820s, soon outnumbering the Mexicans by 10-to-1. After the independence of the [[Republic of Texas]] from Mexico in 1836, the boundary between the U.S. and Texas was firmly established at the Sabine in accordance with the Adams-On<U+00ED>s Treaty. The river served as the western boundary of the United States until the [[Texas Annexation]] in 1845. 

In the 1840s, river boats began navigating the river.  During the [[American Civil War]] on [[September 8]], [[1863]], a small [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] force thwarted a [[United States|Union]] invasion of Texas at the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]], fought at the mouth of the river.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, the middle course of the river became the scene of widespread [[logging]]. The discovery of [[petroleum]] at nearby [[Spindletop]] led to the river basin becoming the scene of widespread oil drilling. The lower river saw the development of many [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] and chemical plants, leading to a degradation of the water quality, which in turn lead to on-going efforts to restore the quality of the river.

The lower river south of [[Orange, Texas]] to Sabine Lake forms part of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], carrying barge traffic.

==The Sabine River In literature==

[[Joe R. Lansdale]], who grew up in [[Texas]] often features the river in his work.  

In [[Jack Kerouac]]'s 1955 novel, ''On The Road,'' the book's narrarator [[Sal Paradise]] and other prominent character [[Dean Moriarty]] (an alias of Kerouac's friend [[Neal Cassady]]) encounter the Sabine River.  It is recorded as an "evil old river," and "the mansion of the snake...we could almost hear the slither of a million copperheads."  A novel in which the theme rests heavily on familiarity with the American continent, it's interesting that Kerouac labels the region as "a manuscript of the night we couldn't read."
