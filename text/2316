}}'''ABA Games''' is a Japanese [[video game developer]], composed solely of [[game designer]] '''Kenta Cho'''. ABA Games' works, available as [[Open source software|open source]] [[freeware]], are predominantly [[shoot 'em up]] games often inspired by classic games in the genre. Its games feature stylised [[retro]] graphics, innovative [[gameplay]] features and modes and are based around random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed as some of the best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release. 

Cho began creating computer games as a hobby during his childhood in the 1980s. After leaving university, he pursued a career with [[Toshiba]] in multimedia research and development while continuing to develop games in his spare time. The positive reaction to ABA Games' first shoot 'em up, ''Noiz2sa'' (2002), encouraged him to concentrate on that genre. The developer's games have been [[ported]] from the original [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] versions to [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]], and various [[Handheld game console|handheld devices]]. One of its games, ''Tumiki Fighters'', was remade, built upon and released for the [[Wii]] console as ''[[Blast Works]]''. According to Cho, he occasionally receives interest in further console ports. In addition to ''Tumiki Fighters'', acclaimed ABA Games titles include ''Gunroar'', ''rRootage'' and ''Torus Trooper''.

ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, began writing games as a child during the 1980s using the [[NEC PC-6001]] [[microcomputer]], as there were few commercially available games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined [[Toshiba]] to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends.<ref name="ashcraft">Ashcraft, Brian, (2008) ''Arcade Mania!

[[File:Gunroar - end of boss.jpg|thumb|200px| ''Gunroar'' is an abstract, naval themed shoot 'em up game, just as in ''[[Geometry Wars]]''.]]
<span id="Gunroar"/>''Gunroar'' is a naval themed shoot 'em up likened to a vertically [[scrolling]] version of ''[[Geometry Wars]]'' (or a cross between ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]'').<ref name="10best">Nagata, Tyler, [http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/f/the-10-best-free-shoot-em-ups/a-200806139592437065/p-3 The 10 best FREE shoot 'em ups], ''GamesRadar'', Accessed Mar 16, 2009</ref><ref name="365days">[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/365-days-of-free-games/a-2008071714293190000 365 days of free games], ''GamesRadar'', Accessed Mar 16, 2009</ref> The player controls a small, abstract gunboat which can be rotated through 360 degrees as in games such as ''Geometry Wars'' and ''[[Robotron 2084|Robotron]]''. The game also features vertical scrolling; however, unlike the standard shoot 'em up in which the propulsion of the craft dictates the pace, players can control the speed at which they proceed through the level. The faster players move through a level, the more [[Score (gaming)|points]] they will score. The game features multiple modes dependent on how the game is controlled: the player can choose to control a single boat by means of the keyboard or mouse or a more complicated "dual" mode allowing the use of two boats using both hands on the keyboard.<ref name="escapist">Miller, Pat, [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_33/204-Retro-Like-Youve-Never-Seen-It-Before Retro Like You've Never Seen It Before], ''The Escapist'', Feb 21, 2006, Accessed Mar 16, 2009</ref> Gunroar was praised for its minimalist design,<ref name="10best"/> impressive [[polygonal]] graphics,<ref name="bbc">Rossignol, Jim, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A25960124 games: kenta cho], ''BBC Collective'', Aug 16, 2007, Accessed Mar 16, 2009</ref> and frenetic action.<ref>Rossignol, Jim, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_20bestfreegames Eurogamer's Summer of PC Plenty], ''EuroGamer'', July 18, 2006, Accessed Mar 16, 2009</ref>

[[File:TUMIKI Fighters - boss 1.jpg|thumb|200px| ''Tumiki Fighters'', a side-scrolling shooter, was remade as ''[[Blast Works: Build, Trade, Destroy]]'' for the Wii console.]]
<span id="Tumiki Fighters"/>''Tumiki Fighters'' is a side-scrolling shooter in which the protagonist is a toy aeroplane flying through a cartoon setting. The game employs a device inspired by ''[[Katamari Damacy]]'', allowing the player to attach debris from destroyed enemies to the aircraft, which in turn act as armour and [[power-up]]s.<ref name ="10best"/><ref name="365days"/> Praised for its addictive gameplay,<ref name="10best"/> ''Tumiki Fighters'' formed the base of ''[[Blast Works: Build, Trade, Destroy]]'', a game published by [[Majesco]] in 2008 for the [[Wii]].<ref name ="ugo">Rosenberg, Adam, [http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=18713 Blast Works Review], ''UGO'', Accessed Mar 16, 2009</ref> Developer [[Budcat Creations]] remade ABA Games' creation for the console and further added an editor function allowing extensive user-created content.

''Blast Works'' featured ''Tumiki Fighters'', as well as three other ABA Games titles, as bonus content. [[UGO]] felt that these games' minimalist graphics, while not outstanding, did retain some charm.<ref name="ugo"/> According to Cho, he did not receive money for the port, allowing his game to be used for free.<ref name ="ashcraft"/>

<span id="RRootage"/>''rRootage'' is a shoot 'em up viewed from a top-down perspective, composed solely of [[Boss (video games)|boss]] battles against large abstract spacecraft attacking the player with intricate barrages of projectiles. The game featured multiple modes: "normal", "Psy", "Ika" and "GW"; the latter three inspired by ''[[Psyvariar]]'', ''[[Ikaruga]]'' and ''[[Giga Wing]]'', respectively. The game was ported to the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod touch]] by developer Lahzrog Games and released as a free download on [[iTunes]].<ref name="cohen">Cohen, Peter, [http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=2934&pagtype=allchandate&pn=1 rRootage for iPhone 2.0 for iPhone review], ''Macworld'', Accessed Mar 17, 2009</ref><ref>Purchese, Rob, [http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/kenta-cho-shmup-free-on-itunes Kenta Cho shmup free on iTunes], ''Eurogamer'', Oct 22, 2008, Accessed Mar 17, 2009</ref> ''GamesRadar'' described the game as "great" and "full of win".<ref name="10best"/> ''Macworld'' acknowledged the game was esoteric but praised its "classic fast paced action", awarding it a maximum five stars. However, the reviewer noted the iPhone version sometimes ran more slowly than intended.<ref name="cohen"/>

<span id="Torus Trooper"/>''Torus Trooper'', a reimagining of the game ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'', features a spacecraft flying through an abstract tunnel, the walls of which twist and change shape. The player competes against the clock, gaining more time by destroying enemies. The game was acclaimed for its stark yet highly attractive graphics.<ref name="macworld">[http://www.macworld.com/article/42207/2005/01/torustrooper.html Torus Trooper], ''Macworld'', Jan 19, 2005, Accessed Mar 17, 2009</ref><ref name="365days"/> ''Titanion'' is a vertical shooter acclaimed for its attractive graphics.<ref name="365days"/> ''Mu-cade'' combines the mechanics of ''[[Centipede (video game)|Centipede]]'' with [[sumo]] wrestling,<ref name="bbc"/> while ''Noiz2sa'' is an abstract "bullet hell" shooter<U+2014><ref name="365days"/> also ported by Lahzrog Games to the iPhone.<ref>Snow, Jean, [http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/10/kenta-cho-shoot.html Kenta Cho's Shooters Coming to iPhone], ''Wired'', Oct 8, 2008, Accessed Mar 17, 2009</ref>
