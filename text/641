'''Derventio''' was a small [[town]] in the [[Roman province]] of [[Britannia]]. Today it is known as [[Little Chester]], on the outskirts of [[Derby]], located in the [[England|English]] county of [[Derbyshire]].<ref name="refhere">{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = Barry C | coauthors = Wacher, John | title = The Small Towns of Roman Britain | publisher = B T Batsford | date = 1990 | location = London | isbn=9780520073036}}</ref>

==Description==
The first [[Roman fort]] in the area was built on the opposite bank of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] at [[Strutts Park Roman fort|Strutts Park]]. It was replaced about AD 80 by a fort on the present site, but this only lasted about forty years, then was decommissioned. There was extensive Roman activity  prompted by the fort, which was connected westward by a road to the [[Icknield Street]], and to the east by a road to Sawley on the [[River Trent]]. A [[Derby Racecourse Roman settlement|fort-vicus]] which manufactured pottery and did ironworking was founded 600m to the east on the Sawley Road.  The fort was later re-occupied and re-used for a further twenty five years. The defensive bank and timber [[palisade]] were now remodelled and stone gates built. Then it lay unoccupied until the late 3rd century when a stone wall was built around the town. <ref name="Kingsway">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CCgQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Feplanning.derby.gov.uk%2Facolnet%2FDocumentsOnline%2Fdocuments%2F23924_33.pdf&rct=j&q=Derby%20Racecourse%20Roman%20vicus%20%26%20cemetery%2013236&ei=Q97aTYnJOoO0-QanhoWfDw&usg=AFQjCNHOIu3VthnVA2XybcuXC50V7FqNiw&sig2=Ac1wgN62GG36gi7GKA97DA&cad=rja|title=Manor Kingsway SPD Derby|last=Vinnels|first=Maria|date=2006-06-15|publisher=White Young Green Environment Ltd for English Heritage|accessdate=23 May 2011}}</ref>  It did not outlive the end of the 4th century.

The modern ''Old Chester Road'' bisects the site of the fort, and in the nineteenth century it was cut by a line of the [[Midland Railway]].

==History==
{{main|Roman conquest of Britain}}
[[File:Roman.Britain.campaigns.43.to.60.jpg|thumb|The campaigns of Ostorius Scapula]]
This part of Britannia was occupied by a tribe known as the [[Cornovii]]. In AD 46-47 the Roman Army under the direction of governor [[Aulus Plautius|Aulius Plautius]] had probably occupied the lands to the south of the [[River Trent]], so in AD 50 this was the front line. There is a shortage of written documentation about these years so reliance is made on archaeological excavations.Late in 47 the new governor of Britain, [[Ostorius Scapula]], began a campaign against the tribes of modern day [[Wales]], and the [[Cheshire Plain|Cheshire Gap]]. During these times [[Strutts Park Roman fort]], was one of the new forts built along the new supply road from [[Wroxeter]] to [[Rossington]].

The campaign to conquer the Silures continued under the governor [[Quintus Veranius]]  and his successor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] but by now Strutt Park's r<U+00F4>le was to maintain the peace. Around AD 74, the lands north of the River Mersey became unstable, when Queen Cartimandus had to ask for Roman assistance to fight off a rebellion. Then in AD78, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], made famous through the highly laudatory biography of him written by his son-in-law, [[Tacitus]], was made governor. He consolidated the forts, improved the road infrastructure and led some now well documented campaigns- firstly in AD78, he reconquered North Wales, then in AD79 he conquered the [[Brigantes]] and [[Parisii]] taking all of Northern England up to the present Scottish border. Strutt's Park fort was vacated in AD 80 when [[Derventio]] was built.

Derventio was occupied for 40 years until around 120AD. To put this in context, the Emperor [[Hadrian]] visited Britannia in AD120 and ordered his [[Hadrian's Wall|wall]] to be built. Though Britannia always had a large garrison, focus now changed to industrial production. Derby produced pottery and had access to the lead mining to the north in the Peak District, later it became a centre for metalworking. This continued for the next 200 years.
