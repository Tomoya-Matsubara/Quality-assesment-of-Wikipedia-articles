'''Thomas Spencer Monson''' (born August 21, 1927) is the 16th and current [[President of the Church|President]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). As president of the church, adherents consider him a [[prophet, seer, and revelator]] of God's will on earth. A printer by trade, Monson has spent most of his life engaged in various church leadership positions and in public service. Appointed by [[Ronald Reagan]] to the President's Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives, Monson is also a recipient of the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts of America's]] [[Silver Buffalo Award|Silver Buffalo]] and the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement|World Organization of the Scout Movement's]] [[Bronze Wolf]]<U+2014>both awards the highest given in each organization. Monson has received three [[honorary doctorates]] and serves as Chairman of the [[Church Educational System|Church Board of Education and Board of Trustees]].

Monson was ordained an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] at age 36 and served as [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] from March 12, 1995 until he became [[President of the Church]].<ref name="LDSbio">{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/background-information/leader-biographies/president-thomas-s-monson |title=President Thomas S.

== Biography ==
Monson was born on August 21, 1927, in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] to G. Spencer Monson and Gladys Condie.<ref>''2006 Deseret Morning News Church Almanac'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: ''[[Deseret Morning News]]'', 2005).</ref> The second of six children, he grew up in a "tight-knit" family<U+2014>many of his mother's relatives living on the same street and the extended family frequently going on trips together.<ref name="influence"/> The family's neighborhood included several residents of Mexican descent, an environment in which he says he developed a love for Mexicans.<ref>''LDS Church News'', July 15, 2000, p. Z03</ref> Monson often spent weekends with relatives on their farms in Granger (now part of [[West Valley City]]), and as a [[teenager]], Monson took a job at the printing business his father managed.<ref name="influence">{{cite web |url=http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695250152,00.html |title=President Monson recalls influence of family on his life |accessdate=2008-06-05 |last=Moore |first=Carrie A. |coauthors= |date=2008-02-04 |work= |publisher=''[[Deseret Morning News]]''}}</ref>

From 1940 to 1944, Monson attended [[Salt Lake City School District#West High School|West High School]] in Salt Lake City. In the fall of 1944, he enrolled at the [[University of Utah]]. Around this time he met his future wife, Frances, whose family came from a higher social class on the east side of the city. Her father, Franz Johnson, felt an immediate connection because Monson's great uncle had [[Baptism|baptized]] him into the [[LDS Church]] in Sweden.<ref name="influence"/> 

In 1945, at age 17, Monson joined the [[United States Navy Reserve|United States Naval Reserve]] and anticipated participating in [[World War II]] in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific theater]].<ref name="LDSbio"/>  He was sent to [[San Diego, California]] but was not moved overseas before the end of the war.  His tour of duty lasted six months beyond the end of the war, and after it was completed he returned to the University of Utah. Monson graduated [[cum laude]] in 1948 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[business management]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofmormonism.com/Thomas%20Monson.html |title=Thomas Spencer Monson |accessdate=2008-06-05  |publisher=[http://historyofmormonism.com/ History of Mormonism.com]}}</ref> Monson did not serve a full-time [[Missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] as a youth and married at age 21.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=f318118dd536c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=e1c50e46d0bdb010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 |title=President Thomas S.

After college he rejoined the Naval Reserve with the aim of becoming an officer. Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter, his ward [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] asked him to serve as a counselor in the [[Bishopric (LDS Church)|bishopric]]. Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made serving in the Navy impossible. After discussing things with church [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Harold B. Lee]], (his former [[stake president]]), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the [[Korean War]]. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop<U+2014>mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.<ref>Thomas S. Monson, [http://byub.org/findatalk/details.asp?ID=4343 Decisions], speech at [[Brigham Young University]], February 6, 1977.</ref><ref>President Thomas S. Monson, A Supplement to the Ensign, June 2008 Ensign</ref>

Monson taught for a time at the University of Utah, then began a career in publishing. His first job was with the ''[[Deseret News]]'', where he became an advertising executive. He joined the advertising operations of the [[Newspaper Agency Corporation]] when it was formed in 1952. On October 7, 1948, he married Frances Beverly Johnson in the [[Salt Lake Temple]], and the couple eventually had three children: Thomas Lee, Ann Frances, and Clark Spencer. Monson later transferred to the Deseret News Press, beginning as sales manager and eventually becoming general manager.<ref name="Timeline"/> While with Deseret News Press, Monson worked to publish [[LeGrand Richards]]'s ''A Marvelous Work And A Wonder''.  He also worked with [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], the LDS Church's representative on publications, with whom he later served in the First Presidency.

=== Young adulthood and local church leadership ===
On May 7, 1950, Monson became an LDS [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] at age 22. He had previously served as ward clerk, ward [[YMMIA]] superintendent, and as a counselor in a bishopric.<ref name="Timeline"/>  At the time, Monson's [[Salt Lake City]] [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] contained over 1,000 people, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/pa/library/0,17905,4884-1,00.html |title=Lost Battalions |accessdate=2008-06-05 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=1987-09-01 |work= |publisher=''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona Magazine]]''}}</ref> He continued his visits to these widows when he was released after five years of service. He brought them gifts during the Christmas season, including poultry he had raised himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=f318118dd536c010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&sourceId=cc1f2e4d12fdb010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&hideNav=1 |title=President Thomas S.

Monson Named 16th Church President |accessdate=2008-06-05 |date=2008-02-04 |publisher=[[LDS Church]]}}</ref>

At age 27, Monson became a counselor to a [[stake president]] in Salt Lake City, and he became a [[mission president]] at age 32. As mission president, he presided over the Canadian [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] of the LDS Church from 1959 to 1962, supervising [[Mormon missionary|church missionaries]] who were not much younger than he was. The Canadian Mission consisted of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]; it was under the leadership of Monson that missionary work began among the [[French language|French-speaking]] population of Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/president-monson-keeps-close-ties-to-canada |title=President Monson Keeps Close Ties to Canada |accessdate=2008-06-05 |date=2008-02-11 |publisher=[[LDS Church]]}}</ref>

Upon his return to Utah after his mission to Canada, Monson resumed his work with the ''Deseret News'' until he was called to be an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] in 1963 at age 36<U+2014>he was the youngest apostle in the church since [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], who had become an apostle in 1910 at age 33. Prior to being called as an apostle, Monson held a few positions on church committees, including the Priesthood [[Home Teaching]] Committee.<ref name="Timeline"/>

=== Apostleship ===
As an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] of the LDS Church, Monson worked in many capacities all around the world. With his business background, he helped oversee many operations of the church including [[KSL (radio)|KSL Newsradio]] and [[Bonneville International]]. He was chair of the Scripture Publication Committee in the 1970s that oversaw publication of the LDS Church edition of the [[King James Bible]] and revised editions of [[Standard works|LDS Church scriptures]] containing footnotes and guides. He has also overseen the church's Printing Advisory, Missionary Executive and General Welfare Committees. While an apostle, he continued his education and received his [[master of business administration]] degree from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1974.<ref name="Timeline"/>

Monson also oversaw church operations in [[Eastern Europe]] and helped the church gain access to its members in the [[Soviet bloc]]. In 1982, he organized the first stake in [[East Germany]] and was instrumental in obtaining permission for the church to build a [[Freiberg Germany Temple|temple]] in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg, East Germany]], in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lds.org.uk/news_details.php?id=681 |title=President Thomas S. Monson: Additional Biographical Information |accessdate=2008-06-05 |date=2008-02-04 |publisher=[[LDS Church]]}}</ref>

=== First Presidency ===
Following the death of [[President of the Church (Latter Day Saints)|Church President]] [[Spencer W. Kimball]] in 1985, newly-installed church president [[Ezra Taft Benson]] asked Monson and [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] to serve as his second and first counselors, respectively.  At age 58, Monson became the youngest member of a [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] since 44-year-old [[Rudger Clawson]] in 1901. 

Monson and Hinckley also served as counselors to Benson's successor, [[Howard W. Hunter]]. When Hinckley succeeded Hunter in 1995, Monson became his first counselor. He served until Hinckley's death on January 27, 2008. As the second in seniority among the apostles behind Hinckley, Monson simultaneously served as [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] ([[Boyd K. Packer]] served as [[Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles|Acting President]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gapages.com/monsots1.htm |title=Thomas S. Monson |accessdate=2008-06-05 |publisher=[http://gapages.com/menu.htm? Grandpa Bill's G.A. Pages]}}</ref>

=== Church President ===
Monson became the 16th president of the LDS Church on February 3, 2008, succeeding [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], who had died seven days earlier. Monson selected [[Henry B. Eyring]] and [[Dieter F. Uchtdorf]] as his first and second counselors, respectively.<ref name="pressrelease"/> When Monson was born, there were fewer than 650,000 members of the church in the world, with most of them being based in the western United States. When he became president, there were over 13 million claimed members worldwide, with the majority of the membership living outside the United States and Canada.

As of October 2008, Monson has announced eight new [[List of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Under construction or announced|temples]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/nation/stories/100608dnlivtemple.43ee305.html |title=Mormon Temple Planned for Rome |accessdate=2008-10-05 |publisher=Dallas News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/gilavalley/ |title=Gila Valley Arizona Temple |accessdate=2008-06-03 |last=Satterfield |first=Rick |publisher=[http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/ LDSchurchtemples.com]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/gilbert/ |title=Gilbert Arizona Temple |accessdate=2008-06-03 |last=Satterfield |first=Rick |publisher=[http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/ LDSchurchtemples.com]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/phoenix/http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/gilbert// |title=Phoenix Arizona Temple |accessdate=2008-06-03 |last=Satterfield |first=Rick |publisher=[http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/ LDSchurchtemples.com]}}</ref> He and his counselors in the First Presidency also met with President [[George W.

=== Political Activism ===
In June of 2008, Monson "signed a letter to all California Mormons, urging them to donate time and money to pass Proposition 8, an effort to establish marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. The Saints overwhelmingly responded, eventually raising some $20 million and helping the measure succeed. The move generated much opposition to the church and even spawned protest marches in front of LDS temples in California, Utah, Arizona and New York."<ref>http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11573218</ref> 

=== Awards ===
Monson has received various awards related to his volunteer and educational involvement.
