'''Le Concorde''', officially named '''H<U+00F4>tel Loews Le Concorde Qu<U+00E9>bec''', is a skyscraper hotel in [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]]. Le Concorde is known for its revolving restaurant, '''L'Astral''', which is situated on the top floor of the hotel and offers a 360-degree view of Quebec City and the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The hotel contains 405 rooms over 26 floors.

==History==

Since its construction in 1970 by wealthy businessman Marcel Adams, owner of the company D<U+00E9>veloppement Iberville, Le Concorde has been operated by the luxury hotel management company [[Loews_Hotels|Loews]] under the terms of a 99-year lease. In 2069, at the end of this lease, ownership will return to Adams or his successor. 

In November 2013, Loews announced that the building would cease operations as a hotel in February 2014.<ref>http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/affaires/actualite-economique/201311/21/01-4713399-changement-de-vocation-pour-lhotel-loews-le-concorde.php</ref> Early in January, it was announced that the hotel would be sold to Groupe Savoie in order to transform it into a retirement apartment building.
