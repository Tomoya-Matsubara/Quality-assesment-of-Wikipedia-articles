'''Dennis Keith Rodman''' (born May 13, 1961) is a retired [[United States|American]] professional [[basketball]] player of the [[National Basketball Association]]'s (NBA) [[Detroit Pistons]], [[San Antonio Spurs]], [[Chicago Bulls]], [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and [[Dallas Mavericks]]. Born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], he was nicknamed "Dennis the Menace" and "Worm" and was known for his fierce [[Defense (sports)|defensive]] and [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] abilities. Playing [[small forward]] in his early years before becoming a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]], Rodman earned [[NBA All-Defensive Team|NBA All-Defensive First Team]] honors seven times and was voted [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] twice. He also led the NBA in rebounds per game for a record seven consecutive years and won five NBA championships (1989, 1990, 1996, 1997, 1998).  His biography at NBA.com states that he is "arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history".

Experiencing an unhappy childhood, Rodman was shy and introverted in his early years. After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993, he reinvented himself as the prototypical "bad boy" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics. He dyed his hair in artificial colors, presented himself with many [[Body piercing|piercing]]s and [[tattoo]]s and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials. He famously wore a [[wedding dress]] to promote his [[autobiography]]. Rodman pursued a high-profile affair with singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and was briefly married to actress [[Carmen Electra]].

Apart from basketball, Rodman is a part-time [[professional wrestler]]. He was a member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] and fought alongside [[Hulk Hogan]] at two ''[[Bash at the Beach]]'' events. He had his own TV show, ''[[The Rodman World Tour]]'', and had lead roles in the action films ''[[Simon Sez]]'' and ''[[Double Team (film)|Double Team]]'' alongside [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]. Both films were severely critically panned, with the latter earning Rodman a triple [[Razzie Award]]. He appeared in several reality TV series and was the winner of the $222,000 main prize of the 2004 edition of ''[[The Mole (U.S. Season 4)|Celebrity Mole]]''. Rodman also won the first ever [[Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling|Celebrity Championship Wrestling]] tournament.

==Early life and education==
Dennis Rodman was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]], the son of Shirley and Philander Rodman Jr., an [[Air force|Air Force]] pilot and veteran of the [[Vietnam War]]. When he was three, his father deserted his family and went on to eventually father 27&nbsp;children with four different women.<ref name="philander">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n19_v90/ai_18709829|title=Dennis Rodman's dad has 27 kids and runs bar in the Philippines|accessdate=2008-08-31|publisher=''Jet''|date=1996-09-23}}</ref> Shirley subsequently took many odd jobs<U+2014>at times, four at the same time<U+2014>to support her family.<ref name="rebound"/> In his 1997 biography ''[[Bad As I Wanna Be]]'', he expresses his disgust for his father: "I haven't seen my father in more than 30 years, so what's there to miss... I just look at it like this: Some man brought me into this world. That doesn't mean I have a father."<ref name=philander/> The impoverished Rodman and his two sisters, Debra and Kim,<ref name="aggies"/> grew up in the [[Oak Cliff]] section of [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]],<ref name=oakcliff>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/classifieds/homecenter/profiles/oakcliff.html|title=Neighborhood Profiles: Oak Cliff|publisher=''Dallas Morning News''|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> considered one of the worst areas of Dallas in those times,<ref name=rifle/> Rodman was so attached to his mother that he refused to move when she sent him to a [[nursery school|nursery]] when he was four years old. According to Rodman, Shirley Rodman was more interested in his two sisters Debra and Kim, who were both considered more talented than him in basketball, and made him a laughingstock whenever he tagged along with them. He felt generally "overwhelmed" by the all-female household.<ref name=bwg/> Debra and Kim would go on to become [[All-America]]ns at Louisiana Tech and Stephen F. Austin respectively.<ref name="aggies"/>

When Rodman experienced his growth spurt, he became even more withdrawn because he felt odd in his own body.<ref name=bwg/> Rodman was so insecure around women that he thought he was [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] in his teens, was still a [[virgin]] when he was 20&nbsp;years old, and eventually had his first sexual experience with a [[prostitute]]; he described this as an unpleasant experience.<ref name=gay>[http://books.google.com/books?id=TGQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&lr&rview=1&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q&f=false Dennis the menace - interview with basketball star Dennis Rodman - Interview - Cover Story], Peter Galvin, ''The Advocate'', January 21, 1997, accessed August 31, 2008</ref>

While attending [[South Oak Cliff High School]], Rodman played under future [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] coach [[Gary Blair]].<ref name="aggies">{{cite web|url=http://www.aggieathletics.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/031507aaa.html|title=Big Hopes In Big Dance For Big 12 Champion and No. 4 Seeded Aggies|date=2007-03-15|publisher=Texas A&M Athletic Department|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> However, Rodman was not considered an athletic standout.

A family friend tipped off the head coach of [[North Central Texas College|Cooke County College]] in [[Gainesville, Texas]]. In his single semester there, he averaged 17.6&nbsp; points and 13.3&nbsp;rebounds, before flunking out due to poor academic performances.<ref name="rebound"/> After his short stint in Gainesville, he transferred to [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]], an [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] school. There, Rodman was a three-time NAIA [[All-America]]n and led the NAIA in rebounding in both the 1984<U+2013>85 and 1985<U+2013>86 seasons. In three seasons there, 1983<U+2013>84 through 1985<U+2013>86, he averaged 25.7&nbsp;points and 15.7&nbsp;rebounds, led the NAIA in rebounding twice and registered a .637&nbsp;field goal percentage.<ref name=nbacom/> He averaged over 25&nbsp;points per game for his three-year NAIA career.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/r/rodmade01.html|title=Dennis Rodman Statistics|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> At the Portsmouth Invitational, a pre-draft camp for NBA hopefuls, he won Most Valuable Player honors and caught the attention of the [[Detroit Pistons]].<ref name="rebound"/>

During this time, Rodman worked at a summer youth basketball camp, where he befriended camper Byrne Rich, who was shy and withdrawn, following from a hunting accident in which he mistakenly shot and killed his best friend. The two became almost inseparable, and formed a bond. Rich invited Rodman to his rural Oklahoma home; at first, Rodman was not well-received by the Riches due to being an African-American. But, the Riches were so grateful to him for bringing their son out of his shell that they were able to set aside their prejudices.<ref name=bwg2>[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067269/2/index.htm Black, White&nbsp;<U+2013> and Gray (Part 2)], www.sportsillustrated.cnn.com, published May 2, 1988, retrieved August 31, 2008</ref> Although Rodman had severe family and personal issues himself, he "adopted" the Riches as his own in 1982 and went from the city life to "driving a tractor and messing with cows."<ref name=bwg2 /> Rodman credits the Riches as his "surrogate family" that helped him through college.

==Basketball career==
===Detroit Pistons===
Rodman made himself eligible for the [[1986 NBA Draft]]. He was drafted by the [[Detroit Pistons]] as the 27th&nbsp;pick in the second round, joining the rugged team of coach [[Chuck Daly]] that was called "Bad Boys" for their hard-nosed approach to basketball. The squad featured [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Joe Dumars]] at the [[Basketball position#Backcourt (guards)|guard]] positions, [[Adrian Dantley]] and [[Sidney Green (basketball)|Sidney Green]] at forward, and [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Bill Laimbeer]]. Bench players who played more than 15 minutes per game were [[sixth man]] [[Vinnie Johnson]] and the backup forwards [[Rick Mahorn]] and [[John Salley]].<ref name=pistons8687>{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DET/1987.html|title=1986-87 Detroit Pistons|publisher=Basketball-Reference.com|accessdate=2008-08-31}}</ref> Rodman fit well into this ensemble, providing 6.5&nbsp;points, 4.7&nbsp;rebounds and some tough defense in 15.0&nbsp;minutes of playing time per game.<ref name=stats/> Winning 52 games, the Pistons comfortably entered the [[1987 NBA Playoffs]]. They swept the [[Washington Bullets]] and soundly beat the [[Atlanta Hawks]] in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against their archrivals [[Boston Celtics]] in what was called one of the physically and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard [[Dennis Johnson]], taunting him in the closing seconds by waving his right hand over his head. When the Celtics took Game Seven, Johnson went back at Rodman in the last moments of the game and mimicked his taunting gesture.<ref name=simmons>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/070222|title=Page 2&nbsp;<U+2013> DJ should have made Springfield while still alive|accessdate=2007-08-17|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2007-02-23|last=Simmons|first=Bill}}</ref> After the loss, Rodman made headlines by directly accusing Celtics star [[Larry Bird]] of being overrated because he was white: "Larry Bird is overrated in a lot of areas. ...Why does he get so much publicity? Because he's white. You never hear about a black player being the greatest." Although teammate Thomas supported him, he endured harsh criticism, but avoided being called a [[racist]] because, according to him, his own girlfriend Anicka "Annie" Bakes was white.<ref name=rebound/><ref name=bwg/>

In the following [[1987<U+2013>88 NBA season|1987<U+2013>88 season]], Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6&nbsp;points and 8.7&nbsp;rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games.<ref name=stats/> The Pistons fought their way into the [[1988 NBA Finals]], and took a 3<U+2013>2 lead, but lost in seven games against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15&nbsp;points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman<U+2019>s defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52&nbsp;minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. But then, he fouled [[Magic Johnson]], who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39&nbsp;seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered.<ref name=1988finals>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19871988.html Lakers Capture the Elusive Repeat], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> In that year, his girlfriend Annie bore him a daughter named Alexis.<ref name=rebound/>

After just falling short of an NBA title, Rodman entered the [[1988<U+2013>89 NBA season|1988<U+2013>89 season]]. Still coming off the bench, he averaged nine points and nine rebounds in 26&nbsp;minutes, providing such effective defense that he was voted into the All-Defensive Team, the first of eight times.<ref name=stats/> In that season, the Pistons finally vanquished their playoffs bane by sweeping the Boston Celtics, winning in six games versus the [[Chicago Bulls]] of scoring champion [[Michael Jordan]] and easily defeating the Lakers with 4<U+2013>0 in the [[1989 NBA Finals]]. Although he was hampered by back spasms, Rodman dominated the boards, grabbing 19 rebounds in Game 3 and providing tough interior defense.<ref name=1989finals>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19881989.html Waiting Game Ends for Impatient Pistons], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref>

In the [[1989<U+2013>90 NBA season|1989<U+2013>90 season]], Detroit lost perennial defensive forward Rick Mahorn due to the [[expansion draft]] of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. It was feared that the loss of Mahorn&nbsp;<U+2013> average in talent, but high on hustle and widely considered a vital cog of the "Bad Boys" teams&nbsp;<U+2013> would diminish the Pistons<U+2019> spirit, but Rodman seamlessly took over his role.<ref name=1990nbafinals>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19891990.html Bad Boys Still the Best], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> He went on to win his first big individual accolade. Averaging nine points and 10&nbsp;rebounds and starting in the last 43&nbsp;regular season games, he established himself as the best defensive player in the game; during this period, the Pistons won 59 games, and Rodman was lauded by the NBA "for his defense and rebounding skills, which were unparalleled in the league".<ref name=nbacom/> For his feats, he won the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]; he also connected on a .595&nbsp;field goal percentage, which made him the most precise shooter of the league.<ref name=stats/> In the [[1990 NBA Playoffs]], the Pistons beat the Bulls again, and in the [[1990 NBA Finals]], Detroit met the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. Rodman suffered from an injured ankle and was often replaced by [[Mark Aguirre]], but even without his defensive hustle, Detroit beat Portland in five games and claimed their second title.<ref name=1990nbafinals/>

After winning his second NBA championship ring, Rodman entered the [[1990<U+2013>91 NBA season|1990<U+2013>91 season]]. In that year, he finally established himself as the starting [[small forward]] of the Pistons. He played such strong defense that the NBA stated he "could shut down any opposing player, from point guard to center".<ref name=nbacom/> After coming off the bench for most of his earlier years, he finally started in 77 of the 82 regular season games, averaged 8.2 points&nbsp;and 12.5&nbsp;rebounds and won his second Defensive Player of the Year Award.<ref name=stats/> In the [[1991 NBA Playoffs]] however, the Pistons were swept by the championship-winning Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. It was the [[1991<U+2013>92 NBA season|1991<U+2013>92 season]] where Rodman made a remarkable leap in his rebounding, collecting an astounding 18.7&nbsp;rebounds per game (1,530 in total), winning his first of seven consecutive rebounding crowns, along with scoring 9.8&nbsp;points per game, and made his first All-NBA Team.<ref name=stats/> His 1,530&nbsp;rebounds (the most since [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s 1,572 in the [[1971<U+2013>72 NBA season|1971<U+2013>72 season]]) have never been surpassed since then; the best mark not set by Rodman is credited to [[Kevin Willis]], who grabbed 1,258&nbsp;boards in 1991<U+2013>92.<ref name=rebleader>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_season.html Season Leaders and Records for Total Rebounds], www.basketball-reference.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> In a March 1992 game, he totaled a career high 34&nbsp;total rebounds.<ref>[http://www.basketballreference.com/teams/boxscore.htm?yr=1991&b=19920304&tm=det 03/04/1992 NBA Box Score at det - basketballreference.com], accessed August 31, 2008</ref> However, the aging Pistons were eliminated by the upcoming [[New York Knicks]] in the First Round of the [[1992 NBA Playoffs]].

Rodman experienced a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly resigned in May, whom he had admired as a surrogate father; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000.<ref name="rebound"/> The following [[1992<U+2013>93 NBA season|1992<U+2013>93 season]] was even more tumultuous. He finally married Annie Bakes in September 1992, the mother of his four year old daughter Alexis, but the marriage went sour quickly and Bakes divorced him in December, an experience which left him traumatized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/classic/bio/news/story?page=Rodman_Dennis|title=Rodman, King or Queen of Rebounds?|date=February 21, 2006|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref> The Pistons won only 40&nbsp;games and missed the [[1993 NBA Playoffs]] entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography ''As Bad As I Wanna Be'', he confessed having thought about [[suicide]] and described that night as an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]: "I decided that instead [of killing myself] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [sic] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be."<ref name=rifle>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1285/is_n2_v27/ai_19192189 Ramrodman - interview with basketball player Dennis Rodman - Interview], Mark Marvel, Feb. 1997, accessed September 1, 2008</ref> Although he had three years and $11.8&nbsp;million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the [[San Antonio Spurs]].<ref name="rebound"/>

===San Antonio Spurs===
In the [[1993<U+2013>94 NBA season]], Rodman joined a Spurs team which was built around perennial All-Star center [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], with a supporting cast of forwards [[Dale Ellis]], [[Willie Anderson (basketball)|Willie Anderson]] and guard [[Vinnie Del Negro]].<ref name=sas9394>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/1994.html 1993-4 San Antonio Spurs], www.basketball-reference.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> On the hardwood, Rodman now was played as a [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] and won his third straight rebounding title, averaging 17.3&nbsp;boards per game along with a career-low&nbsp;4.7 points, but yet another All-Defensive Team call-up.<ref name=stats/> Living up to his promise of killing the "shy imposter" and "being himself" instead, Rodman began to show first signs of bizarre behaviour: before the first game, he shaved his hair and dyed it blonde, which was followed up stints with red, purple, blue hair and a look inspired from the film ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]''.<ref name=nbacom/> During the season, he headbutted [[Stacey King]] and [[John Stockton]], refused to leave the hardwood once after being ejected, and had a highly-publicized two month affair with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref name=rebound/><ref name=top10>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article786188.ece The top 10 Dennis Rodman moments], ''Sunday Times'', January 8, 2006, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> The only player to whom Rodman related was reserve center [[Jack Haley (basketball)|Jack Haley]], who won his trust by not being shocked after a visit to a [[gay bar]].<ref name=haley>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DC1F3DF933A15757C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all A Nonconformist in a League of His Own], Tom Friend, New York Times, April 20, 1995, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> However, despite a 55-win season, Rodman and the Spurs did not survive the First Round of the [[1994 NBA Playoffs]] and bowed out against the [[Utah Jazz]] in four games.

In the following [[1994<U+2013>95 NBA season]], Rodman clashed with the Spurs front office. He was suspended for the first three games, took a leave of absence on November 11, and was suspended again on December 7. He finally returned on December 10 after missing 19&nbsp;games.<ref name=nbacom/> After joining the team, he suffered a shoulder separation in a motorcycle accident, limiting his season to 49&nbsp;games. Normally, he would not have qualified for any season records for missing so many games, but by grabbing 823 rebounds, he just surpassed the 800-rebound limit for listing players and won his fourth straight rebounding title by averaging 16.8 boards per game and made the All-NBA Team.<ref name=nbacom/> In the [[1995 NBA Playoffs]], the 62-win Spurs with reigning [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award]] winner Robinson entered the Western Conference Finals and were considered favorites against the reigning champions [[Houston Rockets]] who had only won 47&nbsp;games. It was thought that Rockets center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] would have a hard time asserting himself versus Robinson and Rodman, who had both been voted into the NBA All-Defensive Teams. However, neither Robinson nor Rodman, who had disrupted a playoff game against the Lakers by sitting down on the court,<ref name=nbacom/> could stop Olajuwon, who averaged 35.3&nbsp;points against the elite defensive Spurs frontcourt, and helped eliminate the Spurs in six games.

Rodman admitted his frequent transgressions, but asserted that he lived his own life and thus a more honest life than most other people: "I just took the chance to be my own man... I just said: 'If you don't like it, kiss my ass.' ...Most people around the country, or around the world, are basically working people who want to be free, who want to be themselves. They look at me and see someone trying to do that... I'm the guy who's showing people, hey, it's all right to be different. And I think they feel: 'Let's go and see this guy entertain us.'"<ref name=rifle/>

===Chicago Bulls===
[[Image:United Center.jpg|thumb|280px| The [[United Center]], home of the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Rodman wrote history in the [[1996 NBA Finals]] when he twice secured 11 offensive rebounds in this building, tying an all-time NBA record.]]

Prior to the [[1995<U+2013>96 NBA season]], Rodman was traded to the [[Chicago Bulls]] of perennial scoring champion [[Michael Jordan]] for center [[Will Perdue]] and cash considerations to fill a large void at power forward left by [[Horace Grant]], who left the Bulls prior to the 1994<U+2013>95 season.<ref name=tradebulls>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n23_v88/ai_17639263 Bulls acquire Dennis Rodman from Spurs in trade for Will Perdue], October 16, 1995, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> Although the trade for the already 34&nbsp;year old and volatile Rodman was considered a gamble at that time,<ref name=nbacom/> the power forward quickly adapted to his new environment, helped by the fact that his best friend Haley was also traded to the Bulls. Under coach [[Phil Jackson]], he scored an average of 5.5&nbsp;points and 14.9&nbsp;rebounds per game, winning yet another rebounding title, and was part of the great Bulls team that won 72 of 82&nbsp;regular season games, an all-time NBA record.<ref name=bestever>[http://www.nba.com/features/bullsbestever_top10.html Best Ever? Ten Reasons Why], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> About playing next to iconic Jordan and hard-working [[Scottie Pippen]], Rodman said: "On the court, me and Michael are pretty calm and we can handle conversation. But as far as our lives go, I think he is moving in one direction and I'm going in the other. I mean, he's goin' north, I'm goin' south. And then you've got Scottie Pippen right in the middle. He's sort of the equator."<ref name=rifle/> Although struggling with calf problems early in the season, Rodman grabbed 20 or more rebounds 11 times and had his first [[triple-double]] against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] on January 16, 1996 scoring 10 points and adding 21&nbsp;rebounds and 10 assists; by playing his trademark tough defense, he joined Jordan and Pippen in the All-NBA Defense First Team, making it the first time that three players from the same NBA team made the All-NBA Defensive First Team.<ref name=nbacom/> Ever controversial, Rodman made negative headlines after a [[Headbutt|head butt]] of referee Ted Bernhardt during a game in [[New Jersey]] on March 16, 1996; he was fined $20,000, a punishment that was criticized as too lenient by the local press.<ref>[http://goinside.com/97/6/rodman.html Dennis Rodman and the $50,000 Mormon Fine], accessed August 31, 2008</ref> In the [[1996 NBA Playoffs]], Rodman scored 7.5&nbsp;points and grabbed 13.7&nbsp;rebounds per game and had a large part in the six-game victory against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in the [[1996 NBA Finals]]: in Game Two at home in the Bulls' [[United Center]], he grabbed 20&nbsp;rebounds, among them a record-tying 11&nbsp;offensive boards, and in Game Six, again at the United Center, the power forward secured 19&nbsp;rebounds and again 11&nbsp;offensive boards, scored five points in a decisive 12<U+2013>2 Bulls run, unnerved opposing power forward [[Shawn Kemp]] and caused Seattle coach [[George Karl]] to say: "As you evaluate the series, Dennis Rodman won two basketball games. We controlled Dennis Rodman for four games. But Game 2 and tonight, he was the reason they were successful."<ref name=1996finals>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19951996.html Bulls' Record-Setting Season Ends in Victory], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> His two games with 11&nbsp;offensive rebounds each tied the NBA Finals record of [[Elvin Hayes]].<ref name=nbacom/>

In the [[1996<U+2013>97 NBA season]], Rodman won his sixth rebounding title en bloc with 16.7&nbsp;boards per game, along with 5.7&nbsp;points per game, but failed to rank another All-Defensive Team call-up.<ref name=stats/> However, he made more headlines for his notorious behaviour: on January 15, 1997, he was involved in another incident during a game against the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. After tripping over cameraman Eugene Amos, Rodman kicked Amos in the groin. Though he was not assessed a [[technical foul]] at the time, he ultimately paid Amos a $200,000&nbsp;settlement, the league suspended Rodman for 11&nbsp;games without pay, thus he effectively lost $1 million.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505EED7103BF932A15752C0A961958260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fR%2fRodman%2c%20 Dennis Rodman to Pay Cameraman - New York Times], accessed August 31, 2008</ref> Missing another three games to suspensions, often getting technical fouls early in games<ref name=nbacom/> and missing an additional 13 matches due to knee problems, Rodman was not as effective in the [[1997 NBA Playoffs]], in which the Bulls reached the [[1997 NBA Finals]] against the [[Utah Jazz]]. There, he struggled to slow down Jazz power forward [[Karl Malone]], but did his share to complete the six-game Bulls victory.<ref name=1997finals>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19961997.html MJ Adds More Finals Heroics to His Legacy], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref>

It was during this time that Rodman seriously took up his hobby of professional wrestling: he appeared in [[World Championship Wrestling]] as a member of [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] with his friend [[Hulk Hogan]]. His first match was at the July 1997 [[Bash at the Beach#1997|Bash at the Beach]] event where he teamed with Hogan in a loss to [[Lex Luger]] and [[Paul Wight|The Giant]].<ref name=interbasket/>

The regular season of the [[1997<U+2013>98 NBA season]] ended with Rodman winning his seventh consecutive rebounding title with 15.0&nbsp;boards per game, along with 4.7&nbsp;points per game.<ref name=stats/> He grabbed 20&nbsp;or more rebounds 11&nbsp;times, among them a 29-board outburst against the [[Atlanta Hawks]] and 15&nbsp;offensive boards (along with ten defensive) versus the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].<ref name=nbacom/> Led by the aging Jordan and Rodman (respectively 35 and 37&nbsp;years old), the Bulls reached the [[1998 NBA Finals]], again versus the Jazz. After playing strong defense on Karl Malone in the first three games,<ref name=1998finals>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19971998.html Jordan's Jumper Secures Chicago's Sixth Title], www.nba.com, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> he caused major consternation when he left his team prior to Game Four to go wrestling with [[Hulk Hogan]]. He was fined $20,000, but it was not even ten percent of what he earned with this stint.<ref name=top10/> However, Rodman<U+2019>s on-court performance remained top-notch, again shutting down Malone in Game Four until the latter scored 39&nbsp;points in a Jazz Game Five win, bringing the series to 3<U+2013>2 from the Bulls perspective. In Game Six, Jordan hit the decisive basket after a memorable drive on Jazz forward [[Bryon Russell]], the Bulls won their third title en bloc and Rodman his fifth ring.<ref name=1998finals/>

In the off-season, Rodman and Malone squared off again, this time in [[WCW]] wrestling at the July 1998 edition of <U+2019><U+2019>[[Bash at the Beach#1998|Bash at the Beach]]<U+2019><U+2019>. He fought alongside [[Hulk Hogan]], and Malone tagged along with [[Diamond Dallas Page]]. In a poorly-received match, the two power forwards exchanged "rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines" for 23 minutes.<ref name=bash1998>[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/jul13_bashbeach.html Mailman doesn't deliver a win], accessed August 31, 2008</ref>

Rodman garnered as much publicity for his public antics as he did for his basketball playing. He dated [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and claimed she tried to conceive a child with him.<ref name=top10/> Shortly after, Rodman famously wore a [[wedding dress]] to promote his autobiography ''Bad As I Wanna Be'', claimed that he was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and that he was "marrying himself".<ref name=top10/> In November 1998, he married [[Carmen Electra]] in a state of [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxication]], and the marriage was invalidated after just 10&nbsp;days.<ref name=top10 />

===Twilight years===
After the [[1997<U+2013>98 NBA season]], the Bulls started a massive rebuilding phase, largely at the behest of then-general manager [[Jerry Krause]]. Head coach [[Phil Jackson]] and several members of the team left via [[free agency]] or retirement, including [[Michael Jordan]], [[Scottie Pippen]], [[Steve Kerr]] and [[Jud Buechler]].<ref name=krause>[http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2003/0407/1535067.html Krause cites health concerns for resignation], ESPN, accessed August 31, 2008</ref> Rodman remained with the Bulls for several months during the 1998<U+2013>99 season, but did not play in any games with the team during and was finally released by the team on January 21, 1999. With his sister acting as his agent at the time Rodman joined the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], for a pro-rated salary for the remainder of the 1998<U+2013>99 season. With the Lakers he only played in 23&nbsp;games and was released.<ref name=stats/> In the [[1999<U+2013>2000 NBA season]], the then 38&nbsp;year old power forward was signed by the [[Dallas Mavericks]], meaning that Rodman returned to the place where he grew up. For the Mavericks, he played 12&nbsp;games, was ejected twice and alienated the franchise with his erratic behavior until he was waived again; Dallas guard [[Steve Nash]] commented that Rodman "never wanted to be [a Maverick]" and therefore was unmotivated.<ref name=lubbock>[http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/031000/pro_031000037.shtml Rodman critical of Mavericks' decision to release him], March 10, 2000, accessed August 31, 2008</ref>

==Post-NBA years==
[[Image:Dennis Rodman ToPo.jpg|thumb|150px|In 2005, Rodman played for [[Torpan Pojat]] of [[Finland]]'s basketball league, the [[Korisliiga]].]]
After his NBA career, Rodman took a long break from basketball and concentrated on his film career and on wrestling. In 1999, he fought "Macho Man" [[Randy Savage]] at [[Road Wild#1999|Road Wild]] 1999 in which Savage shoved him in a portable toilet and eventually won the match.<ref>[http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/roadwild99.html Hogan - Nash, an embarrassment at Road Wild], accessed August 31, 2008</ref> On July 30, 2000 for the [[i-Generation Superstars of Wrestling]] pay-per-view event, he fought against i-Generation Champion [[Curt Hennig]].

From the beginning of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a [[small forward]], and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards or guards equally well<ref name=nbacom/> and won two [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]s. From 1991 on, he established himself as one of the best rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 boards per game in six of the next seven years.<ref name=stats/> Playing [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the [[1996 NBA Finals]]: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, his personal best 34-rebound game on {{Dts|1992|3|4}} is the third best board-grabbing performance since the {{nbay|1972}} season, topped only by a 35-rebound game by [[Charles Oakley]] on {{Dts|1988|4|22}} and a 37-rebound game by [[Moses Malone]] on {{Dts|1979|2|9}}.<ref name=singlegamerebounds>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_game.html Game Leaders and Records For Total Rebounds], basketball-reference.com, accessed September 11, 2008</ref>

On offense, Rodman's output was mediocre. He averaged 11.6 points a game in his sophomore season, but his point average steadily dropped: in the three championship seasons with the Bulls, he averaged five points per game and connected on less than half of his field goal attempts.<ref name=stats/> His free throw shooting (lifetime average: .584) was considered a big liability: on {{Dts|1997|12|29}}, [[Bubba Wells]] of the [[Dallas Mavericks]] committed six intentional fouls against him in only three minutes, setting a record for the fastest foul out in NBA history. This was Dallas coach [[Don Nelson]]'s early version of what would later develop into the famous "Hack-a-Shaq" method that would be implemented against [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and other poor free throw shooters.  The intention was to [[Hack-a-Shaq|force him to attempt free throws]], which in theory would mean frequent misses and easy ball possession without giving up too many points. However, this plan backfired, as Rodman hit nine of these 12 attempts.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/sports/15records.ready.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Take My Record, Please], David Fischer, ''The New York Times'', May 15, 2005, accessed September 11, 2008</ref>

In 14 NBA seasons, Rodman played in 911 games, scored 6,683 points and grabbed 11,954 rebounds, translating to 7.3 points and 13.1 rebounds per game in only 31.7 minutes played per game.<ref name=stats/><ref name=rebleader/> NBA.com lauds Rodman as "arguably the best rebounding forward in NBA history and one of the most recognized athletes in the world" but adds "enigmatic and individualistic, Rodman has caught the public eye for his ever-changing hair color, tattoos and unorthodox lifestyle".<ref name=nbacom/> On the hardwood, he was recognized as one of the most successful defensive players ever, winning the NBA championship five times in six NBA Finals appearances (1989, 1990, 1996<U+2013>8; only loss 1988), being crowned [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award|NBA Defensive Player of the Year]] twice (1990, 1991) and making seven NBA All-Defensive First Teams (1989<U+2013>93, 1995, 1996) and NBA All-Defensive Second Teams (1994). He additionally made two All-NBA Third Teams (1992, 1995), two NBA All-Star Teams (1990, 1992) and won seven rebounding crowns (1992<U+2013>98) and finally led the league once in field goal percentage (1989).<ref name=stats/> However, he was recognized as the prototype bizarre player, stunning basketball fans with his artificial hair colors, numerous tattoos and body piercings, multiple verbal and physical assaults versus officials, frequent ejections, and his tumultuous private life.<ref name=nbacom/>  He was ranked #48 on the 2009 revision of SLAM Magazine's Top 50 Players of All-time.

Rodman has cited [[Pearl Jam]] as his favorite band and befriended them in the mid-1990s. During their [[No Code Tour]], on September 26, 1996, he briefly came onstage to the excitement of the crowd and gave frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] a [[piggyback ride]]. Rodman later received a [[Walkman]] carved with Vedder's initials and containing the concert recording. He has since cited this as one of his most thrilling experiences and claimed, "If it wasn't for Pearl Jam, my life would be a hell of a lot less fulfilling." Not long after, Rodman also gave his unworn #69 [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] jersey to Eddie Vedder,<ref>[http://www.pearl-jam.com/rodman/home.html Pearl Jam references in Dennis Rodman's book] Pearl-Jam.com (July 1, 1997).
