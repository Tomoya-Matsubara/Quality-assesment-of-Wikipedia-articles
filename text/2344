'''Jacques Lipchitz''' ([[August 22]], [[1891]] - [[May 16]], [[1973]]) was a [[Cubism|Cubist]] sculptor.
Jacques Lipchitz was  born '''Chaim Jacob Lipchitz''', son of a [[Jewish]] [[building contractor]] in [[Druskininkai]], [[Lithuania]], then within the [[Russian Empire]]. At first, under the influence of his father, he studied engineering, but soon after, supported by his mother he moved to Paris (1909) to study at the [[<U+00C9>cole des Beaux-Arts]] and the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie Julian]].

It was there, in the artistic communities of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]] that he joined a group of artists that included [[Juan Gris]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and where his friend, [[Amedeo Modigliani]], painted  "''The Sculptor Jacques Lipchitz and His Wife Berthe Lipchitz''."

Living in this environment, Lipchitz soon began to create [[Cubism|Cubist]] sculptures. In 1912 he exhibited at the [[Salon National des Beaux-Arts]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]] with his first one-man show held at L<U+00E9>once Rosenberg's Galerie L<U+2019>Effort Moderne in Paris in 1920. In 1922 he was commissioned by the [[Barnes Foundation]] in [[Merion, Pennsylvania]] for five bas-reliefs.

With artistic innovation at its height, in the 1920s he experimented with abstract forms he called ''transparent sculptures''. Later he developed a more dynamic style, which he applied with telling effect to [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] figure and animal compositions.

With the [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation of France during [[World War II]], and the deportation of Jews to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[extermination camp|death camps]], Jacques Lipchitz had to flee France. With the assistance of the American journalist [[Varian Fry]] in [[Marseille]], he escaped the Nazi regime and went to the [[United States]]. There, he eventually settled in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]].
He was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the [[3rd Sculpture International]] held at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] in the summer of 1949. He has been identified in the LIFE Magazine photograph showing 70 of them.  In 1954 a Lipchitz retrospective traveled from [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York to the [[Walker Art Center]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]]. In 1959, his series of small bronzes "''To the Limit of the Possible''" was shown at [[Fine Arts Associates in New York]].

Lipchitz taught one of the most famous contemporary artists, [[Marcel Mouly]].

Beginning in 1963 he returned to [[Europe]] where he worked for several months of each year in [[Pietrasanta]], [[Italy]]. In 1972 his autobiography was published on the occasion of an exhibition of his sculpture at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.  Jacques Lipchitz died in [[Capri]], [[Italy]]. His body was flown to [[Jerusalem]] for burial.

==Works about==
In 2006, a play about Jacques Lipchitz, "All Grace," by Chris Leyva (a third-year U of Iowa MFA student) premiered at the Iowa New Play Festival, in a production directed by Willie Barbour.  The play deals with Lipchitz' commission to create a sculpture of the Virgin Mary for a Catholic church and sanitorium in the Alps. "All Grace" received generally favorable notices.
