'''J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie Aliadi<U+00E8>re''' (born 30 March 1983) is a [[France|French]] [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[forward (association football)|striker]] for [[FC Lorient|Lorient]].

As a graduate of the elite [[Clairefontaine]] academy, he signed for Arsenal aged 16. After making his Premier League debut in the [[2001<U+2013>02 in English football|2001<U+2013>02]] season, he ultimately had limited opportunities, partly due to injury. For the [[2005<U+2013>06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06]] season he was loaned to three clubs, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[Scottish Premier League]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in the Premier League, and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the [[Football League Championship]], before returning to Arsenal for another season, featuring in the [[2007 Football League Cup Final]] loss to Chelsea. At the beginning of the [[2007<U+2013>08 in English football|2007<U+2013>08]] season he was sold to Premier League club Middlesbrough for <U+00A3>2.5 million, where he spent the next three seasons, two in the Premier League and the last in the Championship, before electing not to extend his contract and leaving the club in June 2010.

== Club career ==
=== Arsenal ===
Aliadi<U+00E8>re signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at the age of 16 before the beginning of the [[1999<U+2013>2000 in English football|1999<U+2013>2000]] season. As a youth player he held considerable promise and he holds the record in the [[FA Youth Cup]] for the most number of goals scored.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

He made his Premiership debut for Arsenal against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in the [[2001<U+2013>02 FA Premier League|2001<U+2013>02 season]], replacing [[Thierry Henry]] in a 4<U+2013>1 victory, and he scored his first goal in a 5<U+2013>2 victory over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 27 August 2002.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2216506.stm | title=Slick Arsenal crush Baggies | publisher=BBC Sport | date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref>

In the [[2003<U+2013>04 in English football|2003<U+2013>04]] season, Aliadi<U+00E8>re was mainly played in the [[2003<U+2013>04 Football League Cup|2003<U+2013>04 League Cup]] rather than the league, scoring Arsenal's first League Cup goal of the season against [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]]. The match finished 1<U+2013>1 after extra time, with Arsenal winning 9<U+2013>8 on penalties.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3204793.stm | title=Arsenal 1<U+2013>1 Rotherham | publisher=BBC Sport | date=28 October 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> He also scored twice against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the following round of the League Cup,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3246940.stm | title=Arsenal youngsters thump Wolves | publisher=BBC Sport | date=2 December 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> his second winning goal for the month for December. In total he netted four goals in the cup run, having also scored against West Brom in the quarter finals, with Arsenal finally being eliminated by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/3314305.stm | title=Arsenal outgun Baggies | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 December 2003 |accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> He was voted best young talent in the 2003<U+2013>04 League Cup.<ref>[http://www.carlingcup.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,11995~611622,00.html  Rising Stars] Retrieved on 1 December 2007</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2010}} As the season went on, he made further inroads into the Arsenal first team, playing 10 Premier League matches, seven as a substitute, to gain a Premier League winners medal, as well as making his [[FA Cup]] debut in a 1<U+2013>0 defeat against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

Aliadi<U+00E8>re missed much of the following [[2004<U+2013>05 in English football|2004<U+2013>05]] season through injury, and was kept out of action until February. On his return, he made six substitute appearances for the first team. Although he failed to score in these matches, he scored eight goals in five games for Arsenal's reserves. Despite his limited opportunities, he was offered and signed a new Arsenal contract, running until the summer of 2009, announced at the same time as a loan move to Celtic.

=== Loan to Celtic ===
In the summer of 2005 Aliadi<U+00E8>re was sent on loan to Scottish club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for the entire [[2005<U+2013>06 in Scottish football|2005<U+2013>06]] season in order to play regular first team football. Despite his limited appearances, Arsenal manager Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger had stated he had a future at Arsenal, but was currently being kept out of the side by the form of Thierry Henry and [[Dennis Bergkamp]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Aliadiere signs on at Celtic Park | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/4625607.stm | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 2005-07-01 | accessdate = 2007-11-25}}</ref> In the end, he made just two substitute appearances for the club, one in each leg of Celtic's loss to [[Artmedia Bratislava]] in the [[2004<U+2013>05 UEFA Champions League]].

=== Loan to West Ham United ===
On 24 August 2005 Aliadi<U+00E8>re decided to move back to London after a lack of first team opportunities, where [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] took over his year-long loan deal, having been promoted back to the Premier League after two seasons in the lower leagues. It was thought{{Who|date=September 2010}} that his disappointment at being behind strikers [[John Hartson]], new signing [[Maciej Zurawski]] and youngsters [[Shaun Maloney]] and [[Craig Beattie]] at Celtic contributed to his departure. Once again affected by injury, he only made eight appearances for West Ham, seven as a substitute.

=== Loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
On 31 January 2006, West Ham terminated the loan, and Aliadi<U+00E8>re moved to the English Midlands to join the [[Football League Championship]] club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] on loan for the remainder of the [[2005<U+2013>06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06]] season. He scored two league goals for Wolves, in games against Hull<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4727024.stm | title=Hull 2<U+2013>3 Wolves | publisher=BBC Sport | date=25 February 2006 | accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> and Watford.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4890832.stm | title=Wolves 1<U+2013>1 Watford | publisher=BBC Sport | date=14 April 2006 | accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> At the end of the season he returned to Arsenal.

=== Return to Arsenal ===
Having returned to Arsenal, during the [[2006<U+2013>07 in English football|2006<U+2013>07]] season Aliadi<U+00E8>re was again mainly used in the [[2006<U+2013>07 Football League Cup]] campaign, scoring both goals in their 2<U+2013>0 win over [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] on 24 October 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6072672.stm | title=West Brom 0<U+2013>2 Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=24 October 2006 | accessdate=2 November 2009}}</ref> His first Premier League goal of the season came came on 16 December 2006, a 2<U+2013>2 draw against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], with Aliadi<U+00E8>re playing for 70 minutes before being replaced by [[Robin Van Persie]]. Continuing appearances in Arsenal's League Cup campaign saw him score in the quarter-final against [[Liverpool F.C]] in a 6<U+2013>3 victory, and in the second leg of the semi-final against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with Arsenal advancing with a 3<U+2013>1 win.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6236687.stm | title=Liverpool 3<U+2013>6 Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=9 January 2007 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Sam | last=Lyon}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/6305313.stm | title=Arsenal 3<U+2013>1 Tottenham (agg 5<U+2013>3) | publisher=BBC Sport | date=31 January 2007 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Sam | last=Lyon}}</ref> Arsenal ultimately lost [[2007 Football League Cup Final|the final]] 2<U+2013>1 to Chelsea, with Aliadi<U+00E8>re featuring for 80 minutes.

With four appearances in Premier League matches during the season; as of 9 January 2007 he had played 37 times for Arsenal, 25 as a substitute, scoring nine goals, all but one coming in the League Cup, four against [[West Bromwich Albion]]. In the January 2007 transfer window Aliadi<U+00E8>re was linked with a move to the Premier League club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in North East England after Wenger said he would be allowed to leave the club. The move failed to happen however after [[Robin van Persie]] broke his foot, and he was told to stay at Arsenal for the time being. He made his final Arsenal appearance on the final day of the 2006<U+2013>07 season against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in a 0<U+2013>0 draw at [[Fratton Park]].

=== Middlesbrough ===
Middlesbrough signed Aliadi<U+00E8>re on 19 June 2007, for an initial fee of <U+00A3>1.5&nbsp;million. He scored his first goal in a Premier League match against [[Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], with a header to draw level at 1<U+2013>1, before Middlesbrough went on to lose the game 4<U+2013>1. This was his first Premier League goal since scoring his first ever for Arsenal on 27 August 2002. He scored for Middlesbrough against old club Arsenal on 15 March in a 1<U+2013>1 draw,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7284973.stm | title=Arsenal 1<U+2013>1 Middlesbrough | publisher=BBC Sport | date=15 March 2008 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Saj | last=Chowdhury}}</ref> before rounding off the season, scoring in the final day 8<U+2013>1 victory over [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 11 May 2008.

Aliadi<U+00E8>re got a red card and three match ban for slapping [[Javier Mascherano]]  in a 23 February 2008 Premier League match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], after Mascherano had raised his hands against him, in full view of the referee. It was the cause of controversy after Middlesbrough's consequent appeal was deemed as "frivolous" by the [[Football Association]] and extended by one more game, with the club's chairman and chief executive, and Tottenham manager [[Harry Redknapp]], deeming this unfair and criticising the FA, contrasting it with a recent appeal by Chelsea's [[Michael Essien]].<ref name="Lamb Slaughters FA">{{cite news | title = Lamb Slaughters FA | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11680_3200633,00.html | publisher = Sky Sports | date = 2008-02-27 | accessdate = 2008-02-27}}</ref><ref name="Gibson rages at FA over appeal">{{cite news | title = Gibson rages at FA over appeal | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/7263735.stm | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 2008-02-28 | accessdate = 2008-02-28}}</ref><ref name="Harry Slams Appeals Process">{{cite news | title = Harry Slams Appeals Process | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11680_3210265,00.html | publisher = Sky Sports | date = 2008-02-28 | accessdate = 2008-02-28}}</ref>

Before the start of the [[2008<U+2013>09 in English football|2008<U+2013>09]] season Aliadi<U+00E8>re switched to wearing the number 10 previously worn by midfielder [[F<U+00E1>bio Rochemback]], when his number 11 was given to 3.2 million summer signing [[Marvin Emnes]]. He scored his first goal of the season in Middlesbrough's 5<U+2013>1 home victory against [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] on 26 August 2008. His first Premier League goal of the season came in a 1<U+2013>0 win against [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] at the [[JJB Stadium]] on 4 October 2008, scoring in the 89th minute of the match. After a run of not scoring in his next ten matches, he again scored against his old club Arsenal, with a headed equaliser in a home 1<U+2013>1 draw on 13 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7763484.stm | title=Middlesbrough 1<U+2013>1 Arsenal | publisher=BBC Sport | date=13 December 2008 | accessdate=2 November 2009 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}</ref> At the end of the season, Middlesbrough finished equal bottom of the Premier League with West Brom, on 32 points, and as a result were relegated to the [[Football League Championship]].

Aliadi<U+00E8>re was booed early on in the [[2009<U+2013>10 in English football|2009<U+2013>10]] season in the Championship by a section of the Middlesbrough fans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} On 12 September 2009, he came off the bench against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] to score two goals after 30 minutes of being on the pitch, and scored another goal in the same week against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. His next goal came on December 26 against [[Scunthorpe United]], in his first start under new manager [[Gordon Strachan]] due to injury. Having failed to reach the play-offs, and after three injury hit seasons at Middlesbrough, he left the club on 30 June 2010 at the end of his contract having decided not to take up the option of extending his contract. In total he had made 86 appearances, scoring 12 goals, for the club.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/middlesbrough/8664874.stm | title=Jeremie Aliadiere set for Middlesbrough exit <U+2013> Strachan | publisher=BBC Sport | date=6 May 2010 | accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> 2010<U+2013>11 pre-season found Aliadi<U+00E8>re training with West Ham with a view to a permanent move to the London club.

[[Al Ain F.C.]], a club based in the city of [[Al Ain]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]], announced on 13 February 2011 that they had signed Aliadiere,<ref>{{cite news|title=The French striker J<U+00E9>r<U+00E9>mie Aliadi<U+00E8>re joins Al Ain Club|url=http://www.alainfc.net/en/index.php?p=shownews&nid=2240|publisher=alainfc.net|date=2011-02-13|accessdate=2012-02-14}}</ref> but he subsequently denounced their claim, stating that he had rejected a move and Al Ain had "been very unprofessional in their conduct".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6754114,00.html | work=Sky Sports | title=Aliadiere rejects Al Ain move}}</ref>

In March 2011, Aliadiere returned to former club, Arsenal's [[London Colney]] training ground in a bid to return to fitness.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1363877/Jeremie-Aliadiere-training-Arsenal.html| title=Wenger welcomes Aliadiere back to Arsenal training as striker seeks to rebuild his career | publisher=Daily Mail | date=8 March 2011| accessdate=8 March 2011 | location=London | first=Sami | last=Mokbel}}</ref> Aliadiere, along with the newly re-signed Jens Lehmann, both played the full 90 minutes in a reserve game against Wigan on the 29th March 2011, losing the game 2-1. There were rumours suggesting that Aliadiere will return to the Premier league with Stoke City for the 2011-2012 season. He was spotted at the club's training ground on several occasions during May 2011. It is speculated that any deal will be heavily performanced based due to Aliadiere's recent injury problems.
