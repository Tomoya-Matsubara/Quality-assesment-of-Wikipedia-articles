The [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Russia]] of November 1917 was an inspiration to Saklatvala and following the establishment of the [[Communist International]] in 1919 he became active in attempting to affiliate the ILP with that new organization. Saklatvala joined with [[Emile Burns]], [[R. Palme Dutt]], [[J. Walton Newbold]], [[Helen Crawfurd]], and others as part of an organized faction called the [[Left Wing Group of the ILP]] which was dedicated to this effort.<ref>James Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume One: Formation and Early Years, 1919-1924.'' London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1968; pg. 26.</ref> When the affilliation drive by Saklatvala and the ILP's left wing ended in failure in the party's March 1921 national conference, Saklatvala left the organization with the others in the Left Wing Group to join the new [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).<ref name=Klugmann1-236 />

He attended the [[Pan-African_Congress#2nd_Pan-African_Congress|2nd Pan-African Congress]] held in Paris in 1921 as a delegate of the CPGB. 

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|October 1922 general election]] the Communist Party of Great Britain launched its first electoral campaign, putting forward candidates in six districts.<ref name=Klugmann1-188>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume 1,'' pg. 188.</ref> Saklatvala ran in the [[Battersea North (UK Parliament constituency)|Battersea North]] district of London, one of two Communists to receive the official endorsement of the [[Labour Party (U.K.)|Labour Party]]<ref name=Klugmann1-188 /> <U+2014> which was in effect an umbrella organization which included affiliated political parties like the ILP as well as representatives of various trade unions. Saklatvala won election in North Battersea, receiving 11,311 votes <U+2014> topping his nearest rival by more than 2,000 votes.<ref>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume 1,'' pg. 191.</ref> Also elected running as a Communist, without official Labour Party support, was J. Walton Newbold, capturing a [[plurality]] of the vote in the [[Motherwell]] electoral district.<ref>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume 1,'' pg. 190.</ref>

Saklatvala was accepted into the Labour Party's parliamentary caucus but while Newbold applied for the same he was rejected.<ref>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume 1,'' pg. 192.</ref> This did not stop Saklatvala and Newbold from joint activity, however, and the pair attempted to raise the demands of the unemployed and the cause of cheap housing and lower rents whenever possible.<ref name=Klugmann1-193>Klugmann, ''History of the Communist Party of Great Britain: Volume 1,'' pg. 193.</ref> Newbold wound up being suspended from the House in May 1923 over his actions with respect to the Curzon ultimatum during the [[Occupation of the Ruhr|French occupation of the Ruhr]].<ref name=Klugmann1-193 />

Saklatvala and Walton Newbold both won seats in the same election to become the first British Communists to achieve this feat.<ref>In 1920 [[Cecil L'Estrange Malone]] had previously joined the Communist Party while already sitting as a Labour Party MP.</ref>
