Tonne was born on 21 May 1916 in [[Frankfurt]]. He entered service with the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1937. In September 1939 he joined II./[[Zerst<U+00F6>rergeschwader 1]] (ZG 1). In June 1940 II./ZG 1 became III./[[Zerst<U+00F6>rergeschwader 76]] (ZG 76) and by July 1940 was an ''Oberleutnant'' with 9./ZG 76. He claimed some 7 victories over the English Channel in 1940. In April 1941 Tonne was ''[[Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' of 6./[[Schnellkampfgeschwader 210]] (SKG 210), and he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in October 1941. He claimed a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) Blenheim on 18 April 1941.

In January 1942 he was posted to command 6./ZG 1, before becoming ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of II./ZG 1. December 1942 saw promotion to Hauptmann and command of II./SKG 10. Tonne became ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'', of SKG 10 until 15 July 1943 when he was killed in a in crash at Reggio di Calabria, when his engine quit shortly after take-off. He was posthumously awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 24 October 1944.
