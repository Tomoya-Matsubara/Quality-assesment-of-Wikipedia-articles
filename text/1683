'''Lilli Palmer''', born '''Lillie Marie Peiser''', (24 May 1914 <U+2013> 27 January 1986) was a [[Germany|German]] actress. She won the [[Volpi Cup]], the [[Deutscher Filmpreis]] three times, and was nominated twice for a [[Golden Globe Award]].

==Life==
Palmer, who took her surname from an English actress she admired, was one of three daughters born to Dr. Alfred Peiser, a [[Germany|German]] [[Jews|Jew]]ish surgeon, and Rose Lissman, an [[Austria]]n Jewish stage actress in [[Pozna<U+0144>|Posen]], [[Prussia]], [[Germany]] (now Pozna<U+0144>, [[Poland]]). When Lilli was four her family moved to Berlin-[[Charlottenburg]]. She studied drama in [[Berlin]] before fleeing to [[Paris]] in 1933 following the [[Nazism|Nazi]] takeover. While performing in [[cabaret]]s, she attracted the attention of British talent scouts and was offered a contract by the [[Gaumont Film Company]]. She made her screen debut in ''[[Crime Unlimited]]'' (1935) and appeared in British films for the next decade. 

In 1943, she married actor [[Rex Harrison]] and followed him to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1945. She signed with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] and appeared in several films, notably ''[[Cloak and Dagger (film)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' (1946) and ''[[Body and Soul (1947 film)|Body and Soul]]'' (1947). She also periodically appeared in stage plays as well as hosting her own television series in 1951. Harrison and Palmer appeared together in the hit Broadway play ''Bell, Book and Candle'' in the early 50s and later starred in the film version of ''[[The Fourposter|The Four Poster]]'' (1952), which was based on the award-winning Broadway play of the same name, written by [[Jan de Hartog]]. She won the [[Volpi Cup|Volpi Cup for Best Actress]] in 1953 for ''[[The Fourposter|The Four Poster]]''. Harrison and Palmer divorced in 1956; they had one son, [[Carey Harrison]], born in 1944. During the marriage, Harrison had many affairs, including one with [[Carole Landis]], who committed suicide in 1948 in the wake of their failed relationship. 

Palmer returned to Germany in 1954 where she played roles in many films and television productions. She also continued to play both leading and supporting parts in the U.S. and abroad. In 1957, she won the [[Deutscher Filmpreis]] for Best Actress for her portrayal of [[Anna Anderson]] in ''Is Anna Anderson Anastasia?''. She starred opposite [[William Holden]] in ''[[The Counterfeit Traitor]]'', an espionage thriller based on fact, (1962), and opposite [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]] in another true [[World War II]] story, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]'' (1963). On the small screen, in 1974 she starred as Manouche Roget in the six-part television drama series ''[[The Zoo Gang]]'', about a group of former underground freedom fighters from [[World War II]], with [[Brian Keith]], Sir [[John Mills]], and [[Barry Morse]].

A talented writer, Palmer published a memoir, ''Change Lobsters and Dance'', in 1975. Reminiscences by [[Vivian Matalon]] and [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] (Matalon directed Palmer in the premiere production of Coward's play ''Suite in Three Keys'' in 1966; see ''[[A Song at Twilight]]'') suggest that Palmer was not always the patient and reasonable person she represented herself as being in this autobiography. She wrote a full-length work of fiction presented as a novel rather than a memoir, ''The Red Raven'' in 1978. 

Palmer was married to Argentine actor [[Carlos Thompson]] from 1957 until her death in [[Los Angeles]] from [[cancer]] in 1986 at the age of 71. 

Lilli Palmer is interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale]], California.
