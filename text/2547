Between 1978 and 1979 the South African Railways (SAR), later renamed Spoornet and then [[Transnet Freight Rail]] (TFR), placed 25 '''Class 9E, Series 1''' locomotives in service.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

==Manufacturer==
The South African '''Class 9E, Series 1''' 50 kV AC electric locomotive was designed by the [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company]] (GEC) for the SAR and built by Union Carriage and Wagon (UCW) in Nigel, [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UCW - Electric locomotives|url=http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |publisher=The UCW Partnership|accessdate=30 September 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012023401/http://www.ucw.co.za/pdf/electric_loco.pdf |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>

In a break with prior practice, UCW allocated builder<U+2019>s numbers to the Class 9E locomotives. UCW usually did not allocate builder<U+2019>s numbers to engines it built for the SAR. While the practice by most other locomotive builders was to allocate builder<U+2019>s numbers or works numbers to record the locomotives built by them, UCW simply used the SAR road numbers for their record keeping.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

==Features==
The locomotive has a single full width air conditioned cab. At the rear end the body work is lowered to provide clearance for the 50 kV electrical equipment that is mounted on the roof. This consists of a single pantograph, a potential divider, a vacuum circuit breaker, a surge diverter and the main transformer<U+2019>s high voltage terminal. The electrical control system is solid state, using thyristors.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

Since huge voltage drops are often encountered between electric sub-stations, the locomotive was designed to be able to operate on a supply varying between 55 and 25 kV. The battery boxes and the main air reservoirs are mounted between the bogies beneath the frame, where a compartment houses a small motor scooter for use by the crew for lineside inspections of the train that can be up to {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} long.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

Series 1 locomotives have four braking systems, air brakes for the locomotive, train air braking, a handbrake and dynamic rheostatic braking which can dissipate 4,200 kW.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

The Series 1 and Series 2 Class 9E<U+2019>s can be visually distinguished from each other by their [[bogie]]s, which were redesigned for the Series 2 locomotives.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/>

==Service==
Class 9E locomotives are used on the 861 kilometres (535 miles) [[Sishen<U+2013>Saldanha railway line|Sishen-Saldanha iron ore line]] to haul export ore from the open cast iron mines at [[Sishen]] in the [[Northern Cape]] to the harbour at [[Saldanha]] in the [[Western Cape]]. Most of the route is across the hot and dry Northern Cape, but the last {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} to Saldanha runs parallel to the Atlantic coastline and is subjected to the fog and salt sea air of the West Coast.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne"/>

In South Africa, the line was unusual for several reasons.
* Construction, which started in 1973, was not undertaken by the SAR, but by the [[Iscor Limited|South African Iron and Steel Corporation]] (ISCOR), who operated the line with diesel-electric motive power. Operations on the Sishen-Saldanha iron ore line was only taken over from ISCOR by the SAR in 1977.
* It was electrified by the SAR at 50 kV AC, compared to the 25 kV AC high voltage it used in other parts of the country.
* At the time it was the longest 50 kV AC electrified railway line in the world.<ref name="Paxton-Bourne">Locomotives of the South African Railways - A Concise Guide (Leith Paxton & David Bourne, 1985), p129-131, ISBN 0 86977 211 2</ref>
* It is the only line in South Africa where electric and diesel-electric locomotives are consisted in mixed power use.<ref name="Actom"/>

==Mixed Power==
On the Sishen<U+2013>Saldanha Orex line General Electric (GE) Class 34 series diesel-electric locomotives run consisted to Class 9E or [[South African Class 15E|Class 15E]] electric locomotives to haul the 342 wagon iron ore trains. Each wagon has a 100 ton capacity and the trains are at least {{convert|3.72|km|mi|abbr=none}} in length, powered by mixed consists of Class 9E or Class 15E electric and GE U26C [[South African Class 34-000|Class 34-000]], [[South African Class 34-400|34-400]], [[South African Class 34-500|34-500]] and [[South African Class 34-900|34-900]] diesel-electric locomotives.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Actom">[http://www.actom.co.za/pages/Actom-Divisions/news.asp?ID=5&DivisionID=4&BusinessUnitID=20&NewsID=45 Actom Divisions News, 22 July 2010]</ref><ref name="Orex"/>

[[File:Sishen Salndanha Iron Ore Train.jpg|thumb|center|x140px|Ore train about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=none}} north of Lamberts Bay]]A Class 9E or Class 15E electric locomotive serves as the master of each mixed electric and diesel-electric consist, with a total of between nine and twelve locomotives per train, twelve being the maximum number allowed. Before the Class 15E was placed in service in 2010, motive power usually consisted of three sets of locomotives, each set made up of one or two Class 9E electrics and one or two Class 34 diesel-electrics, with each set<U+2019>s leading electric locomotive controlling its respective set of diesels by means of a ''slimkabel'' (smart cable). In effect each ore train was made up of three separate 114 wagon trains consisted together, with the locomotives of all three trains controlled by means of a [[Locotrol]] radio distributed power control system by one crew in the leading electric locomotive. A typical train would therefore be made up of locomotive set A, 114 wagons, locomotive set B, 114 wagons, locomotive set C, and 114 wagons.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Actom"/><ref name="Orex"/><ref>[http://www.getransportation.com/rail/rail-products/locomotives/on-board-systems/l.html Locotrol Distributed Power]</ref>

Some problems were experienced using this configuration, and after a couple of major derailments the locomotive configuration was changed to four sets, with locomotive set D initially made up of two Class 34 diesel-electric locomotives at the rear end of the train, pushing at between 40% and 50% of tractive power at all times, depending on the grades being traversed. The total maximum number allowed was still between nine and twelve locomotives per train.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Orex"/>

As more Class 15Es were delivered and placed in service, Class 9E or 15E electrics replaced the pair of Class 34 diesel-electrics in set D. At the same time the more powerful Class 15E also made it possible to use as few as seven locomotives per train, with locomotive sets A, B and C each made up of one Class 15E and one Class 34, and set D of a single Class 15E.<ref name="E&D diagram-book"/><ref name="Orex">Information supplied by Orex train crew members</ref>
