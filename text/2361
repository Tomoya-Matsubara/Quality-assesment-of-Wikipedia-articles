The '''''Reina Victoria Eugenia''''' class was a class of three [[battleship]]s of the [[Spanish Navy]] authorized as the ''Plan de la Segunda Escuadra'' under the Navy Law of 1913. The class, as well as the lead ship, were named for [[King Alfonso XIII]]'s English [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|queen consort]]. The other two ships were classified as "B" and "C". It was supposed to be designed by [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], and built by [[John Brown & Company|John Brown]]. The ships were never built due to Britain's involvement in [[World War I]], which halted all foreign projects being constructed in British yards.

== Background ==
Following disastrous losses in the [[Spanish-American War]] of 1898, Spain lacked the money to rebuild its navy, so it was not until the Navy Law of 7 January 1908 that a new program authorizing three new battleships, the {{sclass-|Espa<U+00F1>a|battleship|4}} ([[Spanish battleship Espa<U+00F1>a (1912)|''Espa<U+00F1>a'']], [[Spanish battleship Alfonso XIII|''Alfonso XIII'']], and [[Spanish battleship Jaime I|''Jaime I'']]), along with other ships, was passed. The delay enabled Spain to take advantage of experience gained by Britain with the world's first commissioned [[dreadnought]], {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, and by the United States with its first dreadnought, {{USS|South Carolina|BB-26|6}}. As Spain was incapable of building the ''Espa<U+00F1>a'' class herself due to a lack of resources,<ref name="Fitzsimons, p.856"/> Armstrongs were contracted for the design and [[John Brown & Company|John Brown]] for the construction of the shipyard and ships themselves.<ref name="Fitzsimons, p.856">Fitzsimons, p.856.</ref>

A second Navy Law was passed in 1912 named the ''Plan de la Segunda Escuadra'' (Second Squadron Plan). It called for, among several other ships, three dreadnoughts to supplement the ''Espa<U+00F1>a'' class. These dreadnoughts were named the ''Reina Victoria Eugenia'' class. They were to be in laid down in 1914 and 1915 and completed around 1920.<ref name="CBB"/>

== Design history ==
The class consisted of three ships, ''Reina Victoria Eugenia'', the lead ship, and two others named ''B'' and ''C''. The lead ship was named after King Alfonso's English wife.<ref name="CBB">Sturton (1987), p.144</ref> They were designed by Vickers-Armstrongs and were planned to displace {{convert|21000|LT|t}} with a speed of {{convert|21|kn}}.<ref name="BB1"/> Early plans for the type called for an armament of four twin {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} guns; however, financial difficulties resulted in the selection of an armament of four twin {{convert|13.5|in|adj=on}} guns instead, which still would have had a longer range than most contemporary ships.<ref name="BB1">Garzke and Dulin, p. 438</ref> The secondary armament would have been 20 {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} guns.<ref name="CBB"/> Other specifications of the ships were never decided upon, although it is probable that they would have resembled contemporary British ships, with two closely spaced funnels along with super-imposed turrets fore and aft.<ref name=conway190621>Sturton (1985), p. 378</ref> 

As with the ''Espa<U+00F1>a''-class battleships, significant technical assistance from Britain would have been required. The outbreak of the First World War led to both the delay of the ''Espa<U+00F1>a'' class and the cancellation of the ''Reina Victoria Eugenia'' project. Since Spain did not sign the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], whose signatories were forced to limit their ships to no more than 35,000 tons, the class was available for future Spanish governments to construct, either as a main ship or as support to other planned designs, like a possible {{sclass-|Littorio|battleship}} or a ship based on the {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}. However, the class was never constructed.<ref name="BB1"/>
