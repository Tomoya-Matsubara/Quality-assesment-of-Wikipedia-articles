''''''Contrareloj''' is the second album of [[Enanitos Verdes]] published on [[1986]].

Originally released in [[1986]], Contra Reloj was Los Enanitos Verdes sophomore effort but the first that the group recorded for CBS (now [[Sony]]). Produced by [[Andr<U+00E9>s Calamaro]], the album is a good collection of simple pop/rock songs and probably one of the strongest albums that the band has ever recorded. It's like a greatest-hits collection in itself: "La Muralla Verde," "Conciencia Contra Reloj," "Cada Vez Que Digo Adi<U+00F3>s," and "Simulacro de Tensi<U+00F3>n" were massive hits at the time and still are covered by the band in its shows.
