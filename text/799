==Synopsis==
''Journey of a Red Fridge'' is a story of a 17-year-old boy named Hari [[Rai people|Rai]], who lives in a small village in the [[Himalayan Mountains]] of [[Nepal]], and his extraordinary journey. Hari is a student. However, he also works as a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] so that he could pay for his tuition and cover his living expenses. Although very young, he already has three years of experience carrying loads up and down the mountain, mostly tourists' backpacks. This time, he gets a job to carry a huge red refrigerator from the top of the mountain, to the nearest town.

We follow Hari [[Rai people|Rai]] on his journey through the fascinating [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] landscapes, we discover Hari<U+2019>s inner life, his thoughts, hopes and dreams and we also get to know the culture and the local people<U+2019>s way of life in this region. We learn about their relation with the most important aspects of their lives: family, nature and religion.

Out of 60,000 child [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] in [[Nepal]], Hari is one of the few lucky ones to have a chance of going to school. ''Journey of a Red Fridge'' shows us what it takes for him to get his education.
