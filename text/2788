'''Fatiha Boudiaf''' ([[Oran]], [[1944]]) was married to former [[Algeria]]n president [[Muhammad Boudiaf]]. After his assassination, she set up the ''Boudiaf Foundation'' to spread her husband's message of peace and to help Algerian widows.

She received the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] for International Cooperation in [[1988]].

Ms Boudiaf has denounced the official investigation of her husband's death, suggesting that it was not the work of a lone fanatic but part of a greater plot.
