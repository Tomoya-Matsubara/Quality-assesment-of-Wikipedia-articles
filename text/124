'''''Earthstar''''' was an [[electronic music]] group originally from [[Utica, New York |Utica]], [[New York]], in the [[United States]].  Earthstar was encouraged by [[Krautrock]]/[[Kosmische Musik]]/electronic music artist, composer, and producer [[Klaus Schulze]] to relocate to [[Germany]] where they were signed by [[Sky Records]].  Schulze produced their second and most successful album, ''[[French Skyline]]''.  Earthstar is notable as the only American band who participated in Germany's Kosmische Musik/electronic music scene while still at its height.

=== Musical Style ===

The Earthstar entry in the [[New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock]] describes the wall of sound on the second and third albums:  "[Group leader Craig] Wuest's vision propels these two albums, his desire apparently is to create music that doesn't necessarily suggest a particular instrument, rather creates a new texture. Therefore, though there are credits for flute, guitar, bass, violin, viola, French horn, sitar and vocals, it's pretty hard to distinguish any of these..."  Other albums have a softer style with more distinct instrumentation.  Earthstar is also notable for [[Craig Wuest]]'s heavy use of the [[mellotron]] and the rare [[Birotron]], a variation on the mellotron that can sustain notes beyond eight seconds.

== History ==
=== 1977 - 1979 (Utica and Moontower) ===

'''Earthstar''' was the brainchild of keyboardist/synthesist Craig Wuest.  In the early 1970s Wuest was among the first musicians in Utica who owned a synthesizer.  Wuest was heavily influenced by the [[Germany|German]] electronic music scene of the 1970s, including [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Popol Vuh (German band) |Popol Vuh]], and [[Harmonia (band) |Harmonia]].  Around the same time, Utica guitarist Dennis Rea had founded what he describes as an "eccentric [[progressive rock]] band," [[Zuir]].  According to Rea, "...being the only two adventurous music acts in town, collaboration between Craig and the members of Zuir was inevitable." Earthstar was born out of the partnership of Wuest, Rea, and two other members of Zuir:  bassist [[Norm Peach]] and drummer [[Daniel Zongrone]], plus other Utica-area musicians.  In [[1977]] Earthstar was signed by [[Nashville]]-based [[Moontower Records]], who released the group's first album, ''[[Salterbarty Tales]],'' the following year.  Earthstar also began recording its second album, ''[[French Skyline]],'' in Utica in 1978.

Rea also recalls concerts during the Utica period: "The group performed live only a handful of times, mostly at inappropriate venues like roadhouse bars and college beer halls, with predictable results."

=== 1979 - 1983 (Germany and Sky) ===

Craig Wuest was an admirer of electronic music pioneer [[Klaus Schulze]], with whom he struck up a correspondence.  Schulze encouraged Wuest and Earthstar to come to Germany, intending to sign them to his [[Innovative Communications]] record label.  Wuest sold his grand piano, which had played a prominent part on ''Salterbarty Tales,'' to finance the move. Other Earthstar musicians joined Wuest in Germany to continue work on ''French Skyline,'' which they originally intended to complete in March, [[1979]].  Issues with gathering the musicians together delayed recording sessions until late spring. 

Guitarist Dennis Rea describes his own decision to travel to Germany in his [[2006]] book ''Live At The Forbidden City'':
<blockquote>
"I was one of several old Utica mates invited to participate in the project.  Since the prospect of making a record with international music luminaries was an offer I couldn't refuse, I dropped my plans to attend music school and instead spent half a year in the countryside near [[Hanover]] working on Earthstar sessions..."
</blockquote> 
While much of ''French Skyline'' was recorded at [[Klaus Schulze studios]] in [[Hamb<U+00FC>hren]], [[West Germany]], with additional recording taking place at [[IC Studios]] in [[Ovelg<U+00F6>nne]], Schulze's label never signed Earthstar. The group's next three albums were released by [[Hamburg]]-based Sky Records instead, beginning with ''French Skyline'' in 1979, which was co-produced by Schulze and Wuest.

Earthstar's second album for Sky, ''[[Atomkraft? Nein, Danke!]]'' (literally "Nuclear power?  No, thank you!"), was an environmental [[tone poem]].  The album was recorded in 1979 and [[1980]] and was released on [[February 1]], [[1981]].  The Planet Mellotron Web site describes it as "more laid back" than ''French Skyline'' and "...an ideal opportunity to hear the rarest tape-replay instrument," the Birotron. ''Atomkraft? Nein, Danke!'' was the last album to feature many of the core musicians that had been part of Earthstar's earlier efforts in Utica, including Dennis Rea, who moved to [[New York City]] in [[1983]] and is now active in [[Seattle]]. 

In [[1980]] the same lineup that had just created much of ''Atomkraft? Nein, Danke!'' also recorded an entire album's worth of material that was never released. The album, to have been titled ''Sleeper, the Nightlifer'', featured a string section (and even vocals) and represented a marked stylistic shift for the band, with influences ranging from [[Mike Oldfield]] to contemporary minimalist composers to [[ECM]] [[jazz]]. 
 
A third album for Sky, ''[[Humans Only]],'' was recorded in [[1981]] and released the following year.  The album was the result of a partnership between Wuest and Utica-based guitarist and songwriter [[Dan Hapanowicz]] and presented a far more conventional, softer, more guitar-oriented sound than previous releases.  One track from the ''Sleeper, the Nightlifer'' sessions, "Indian Dances", was rerecorded for ''Humans Only'' in a shorter, somewhat pared down version.

=== Later Works? ===

According to Dennis Rea, Earthstar dissolved not long after the release of ''Humans Only.''  A now defunct earthstarmusic.com Web site listed later releases; one in particular, ''Axiom,'' which was listed as following ''Humans Only,'' had clearly been recorded and [[MP3]] samples of the music were included on the Web site.  They revealed a conventional, melodic, controlled electronic music sound.  It is likely that by this point Earthstar had become Wuest's solo project. However, no record of the release of ''Axiom'' or any other later works can be found.

Sky Records did include Earthstar tracks on both volumes of their ''Schwingungen - New Age Music'' compilations in [[1985]] and [[1986]].
