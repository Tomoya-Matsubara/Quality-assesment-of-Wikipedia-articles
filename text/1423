'''Dolphin Starbeam''', known as '''Dolph''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]]) is a character of the TV show ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Dolph is part of [[Jimbo Jones]]'s gang of bullies (along with Jimbo, [[Kearney (Simpsons)|Kearney]], and occasionally [[Nelson Muntz]]). Dolph is recognized by his asymmetrical haircut which covers one eye and wears cutoff shorts and "[[Chuck Taylor All-Stars]]" style basketball shoes. Also, it has been revealed that Dolph is [[Jewish]] and attends Hebrew School, which was first shown during the seventeenth-season episode "[[See Homer Run]]". He may also have more than one father, as stated in the thirteenth-season episode "[[I Am Furious Yellow]]". Although he doesn't talk much, from the few times he does, one can see that, like the rest of the gang, he is not very bright(Once claiming to be [[Elvis]] after playing a [[saxaphone]]).

He is named after [[Matt Groening]]<U+2019>s classmate Dolph Timmerman. Groening has said that Timmerman wasn<U+2019>t a bully at all, but a "really cool guy." 

==Criticisms==
Dolph is generally regarded as the most mysterious of Jimbo's gang, usually silent and always soft-spoken when that silence is broken except in [[Kamp Krusty]] where he speaks quite loudly to Bart, Lisa and the other children. It is speculated that Dolph may be the most sensitive of the group, even more so than (occasional) softie Nelson Muntz. His real name is (according to the trading cards: Dolphin Starbeam) something about which no hints have been provided, and some fans {{fact}} have offered criticism for the show's writers, citing that in ''The Simpsons''<U+2019> run, Dolph is one of very few characters to have been almost completely ignored.
