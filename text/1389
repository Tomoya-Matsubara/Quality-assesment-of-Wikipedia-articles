"'''Spotlight'''" is a song by American singer-songwriter [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], from her 1987 remix compilation ''[[You Can Dance]]''. It was released as a single in Japan on April 25, 1988 by [[Sire Records]] and [[Warner Music Group|Warner-Pioneer Japan]]. Initially rejected during her ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' album recording sessions, it was written by Madonna, [[Stephen Bray]] and Curtis Hudson. It was inspired by the song "[[Everybody Is a Star]]" (1970), by American rock band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The song was remixed by [[Shep Pettibone]], with additional mixing done by [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]].

"Spotlight" features instrumentation from [[Programming (music)|drums]], [[Synthesizer|bass synths]] and [[clapping|handclaps]], accompanied by [[echo (phenomenon)|vocal echos]], a piano segment and violin phrases in the musical interlude. The lyrics talk about how one can be famous if one sings about it. The song received mixed reviews from critics. After its release, it reached number 68 on the Japanese [[Oricon]] weekly singles chart, as well as number three on its international singles chart. Although not released in the United States, the song managed to chart on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Airplay chart in early 1988. The song was used in a [[Mitsubishi]] [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]] commercial, in which she appeared.

==Background==
By the mid-eighties, post-disco dance music was extremely popular and the concept of [[remix]] was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Hence Madonna, who was the most popular dance artist of that era, decided to create a similar remix compilation album, later titled ''[[You Can Dance]]'', which included seven of her up-tempo songs.<ref name="tara1"/> Along with the pre-released tracks in remixed form, "Spotlight" was included as an added bonus. Madonna said that she was inspired by the song "[[Everybody Is a Star]]" (1970), by American rock band [[Sly and the Family Stone]].<ref name="rikky">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=28}}</ref>

In 1983, Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of the group [[Pure Energy (group)|Pure Energy]] had written the song "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", which Madonna recorded and released as the third single from her [[Madonna (album)|self-titled debut album]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-madonna-became-madonna-an-oral-history-20130729?page=2 |title =Madonna's Debut Album at Thirty: An Oral History - Music News - Rolling Stone |last = Howe |first = Sean |date = 2013-07-29 |website = Rolling Stone |accessdate= 2013-11-29 }}</ref> After the single's commercial success, Hudson wrote a song sounding like "Holiday", in case [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner]], Madonna's record company, wanted to release a similar song to it.<ref name="blogcritics">{{cite web |url = http://blogcritics.org/interview-curtis-hudson-lisa-stevens-songwriters1/ |title = Interview: Curtis Hudson & Lisa Stevens, Songwriters of Madonna's "Holiday" (Part 2) |last = Kantor |first = Justin |date = 2012-02-03 |website = Blogcritics |accessdate=  2013-11-29 }}</ref> He named it "Spotlight" and offered it to Madonna, who recorded the song for her 1986 album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]''.<ref name="tara1"/> However, Madonna didn't include it in the album because she felt that it was similar in composition and structure to "Holiday".<ref name="tara1">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=129}}</ref>

When Madonna decided to create ''You Can Dance'', she and [[Stephen Bray]] reworked the demo composed by Hudson<ref name="blogcritics"></ref> and Madonna asked [[Shep Pettibone]], who had remixed her songs from ''True Blue'', to remix "Spotlight" and included it on the album.<ref name="tara1"/> [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], who had recorded the original demo during the ''True Blue'' sessions, assisted Pettibone in remixing the song.<ref name="rikky"/>

"Spotlight" begins with the sound of [[Programming (music)|drums]], [[Synthesizer|bass synths]] and [[clapping|handclaps]], followed by Madonna uttering the words "Spotlight, shine bright". After the first [[Song structure (popular music)|verse]], the sound of keyboard is heard during the [[chorus effect|effect]].<ref name="rikky2">{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=29}}</ref> It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an [[Break (music)|interlude]] featuring [[echo (phenomenon)|vocal echos]], a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words "Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa" in the same melody.<ref name="rikky2"/> The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that "Everybody is a Star" and that if one wants to be famous and be under the "Spotlight", the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her.<ref name="rikky2"/> According to the sheet music published at SheetMusicPlus.com, the song is set in the [[time signature]] of common time, with a tempo of 100 [[Tempo|beats per minute]]. It is set in the key of [[F major]] with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes of C<sub>5</sub> to B{{music|flat}}m.

===Chart performance===
"Spotlight" was not officially released as a single in the United States; therefore it was not eligible at the time to appear on [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100]]. Even so, radio stations started to play the song unofficially and it managed to garner enough airplay to appear on the [[Radio Songs|Hot 100 Airplay]] chart of ''Billboard'' in early 1988.<ref name="feld"/> It debuted on the Airplay chart at 37 on the issue dated January 16, 1988, and was the highest debut of the week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs?chartDate=1988-01-16&order=gainer|title=''Billboard'' Hot 100 Airplay: Week Ending January 16, 1988|date=1988-01-16|accessdate=2010-05-20|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc}}</ref> After three weeks, "Spotlight" reached a peak of 32 on the chart, but fell to 40 the next week, before being sent for [[recurrent rotation]].<ref name="feld">{{harvnb|Feldman|2000|p=211}}</ref> It also charted on the [[Billboard charts|Hot Crossover Singles]] chart, reaching a peak of 15 on January 9, 1988.<ref name="feld"/> The song was released commercially in Japan on April 25, 1988.<ref name="oricon">{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/162927/products/music/170772/2/|title=<U+30B9><U+30DD><U+30C3><U+30C8><U+30E9><U+30A4><U+30C8>|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Oricon]]|date=1988-04-25|accessdate=2011-08-17}}</ref> "Spotlight" peaked at number 68 on the [[Oricon]] weekly singles chart, remaining on the chart for five weeks.<ref name="oricon"/> It also charted on the Oricon international singles chart, reaching a peak of three on May 19, 1988, staying on the chart for ten weeks.<ref name="jap">{{harvnb|Schilling|1997|p=149}}</ref>

The commercial promoted their [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]] model F-5.3.<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=201}}</ref> In the commercial, Madonna was featured as coming out of a car and sitting down on a sofa, while watching a film on the VCR, as "Spotlight" is played in the background. The song was also used as cross-promotion for the Japanese leg of her 1987 [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] under the campaign name of "Dreams Come True".<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=203}}</ref>
