'''Interstate 470''' (I-470) is a {{convert|13.72|mi|km|adj=on}} loop highway that bypasses the downtown area of [[Topeka, Kansas]] . I-470 begins at [[Interstate 70 in Kansas|I-70]] in western Topeka and heads southeast, running [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 75 in Kansas|U.S. Route 75]] (US 75). At the I-470 junction with [[Interstate 335 (Kansas)|I-335]], the freeway becomes part of the [[Kansas Turnpike]] until I-470 reaches its eastern terminus with [[Interstate 70 (Kansas)|I-70]]. The Kansas Turnpike was opened in the 1950s, comprising the eastern portion of the route. Several years later, in the early 1960s, the western section of I-470 was opened to traffic.

==Route description==
Interstate 470 begins in the northwestern part of Topeka at an interchange with [[Interstate 70 in Kansas|I-70]], [[U.S. Route 40 in Kansas|US-40]], and [[K-4 (Kansas Highway)|K-4]].  [[U.S. Route 75 in Kansas|US-75]] approaches the interchange from the east and [[concurrency (road)|joins]] I-470.  The two routes head southeastward along the western edge of the city.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/Mapscounties.asp|title=Map of Shawnee County, Kansas|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>  Along this stretch of the interstate, there are three interchanges; exits 1B, 2, and 3.  Because of both the southeast-to-northwest alignment of the road and the proximity of two cross-streets, exits 1B and 3 are each made up of two [[half-diamond interchange]]s.  At exit 1B, traffic leaving eastbound I-470 is deposited onto Huntoon Street.  Vehicles merging onto eastbound I-470 must access the entrance ramp from Wanamaker Road.  The intersection of Huntoon and Wanamaker is adjacent to the freeway.<ref>{{Google maps|url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Topeka&aq=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=31.646818,56.513672&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Topeka,+Shawnee,+Kansas&ll=39.042703,-95.762222&spn=0.007566,0.013797&z=16|title=I-470 exit 1B|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>  Exit 3 is constructed similarly to exit 1B, while exit 2 is a standard diamond interchange.

Through southern Topeka, I-470&nbsp;/ US-75 curve to the south-southeast where they intersect Gage Boulevard.  Further southeast, US-75 splits away from I-470 at a complex interchange with Burlingame Road.<ref name="routelog"/>  Just east of the US-75 interchange, there are two [[trumpet interchange]]s in quick succession.  The first provides access to Topeka Boulevard, and the second connects to the [[Kansas Turnpike]].  It also marks the northern end of [[Interstate 335 (Kansas)|I-335]].  I-470 merges onto the Kansas Turnpike and the two routes head northeast towards I-70.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://ksturnpike.com/kta_map.shtml|title=Map of Kansas Turnpike|publisher=[[Kansas Turnpike Authority]]|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://cjonline.com/news/local/2010-06-24/road_work_to_affect_i_70_470|title=Road Work to Affect I-70, I-470|newspaper=[[Topeka Capital-Journal]]|date=June 24, 2010|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref> The tollway continues northeastward through southeastern Topeka, passing near to [[Lake Shawnee (Kansas)|Lake Shawnee]] and eventually reaching I-470's terminus at [[Interstate 70 in Kansas|I-70]].<ref name="bing">{{bing maps|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/#JmNwPTM5LjAzOTk4MTc5ODYyMzAxfi05NS42ODExOTU3ODAwOTE5NyZsdmw9MTImZGlyPTAmc3R5PXImcnRwPXBvcy4zOS4wNDkxOTk4MzMyNzI3NjZfLTk1Ljc3MTU3ODUzMDA3MDE5X25lYXIlMjBSYW1wJTJDJTIwVG9wZWthJTJDJTIwS1MlMjA2NjYxNV9fX2FffnYuMzkuMDMwNzYxNzMxMDI5ODM0Xy05NS41OTA4MTMwMzAxMTM3NV9JLTQ3MCUyMEVhc3QlMjAlMkYlMjBLYW5zYXMlMjBUcGtlfnBvcy4zOS4wMzA4MzY3MzkxOTg0MDZfLTk1LjU5MDgxMzAzMDExMzc1X19fX2FfJm1vZGU9RCZydG9wPTB+MH4wfg==|title=I-470|accessdate=January 24, 2011}}</ref>

The freeway is maintained by the [[Kansas Department of Transportation]] (KDOT), who is responsible for maintaining and constructing highways in Kansas. As part of this role, KDOT surveys traffic on their highways in terms of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2007, KDOT calculated that as few as 10,370 vehicles used I-470 daily along the Kansas Turnpike near the I-70 interchange and as many as 43,000 vehicles used I-470 daily west of the Gage Boulevard interchange.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/MapCountCities.asp|title=KDOT Traffic Count Map of Topeka|format=PDF|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|date=August 2007|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref> As part of the [[Interstate Highway System]], the entire route is listed on the [[National Highway System]], a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/maps/ks/topeka_ks.pdf|title=National Highway System: Topeka, Kansas|publisher=Federal Highway Administration|format=PDF|date=July 2003|accessdate=February 19, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Topeka, Kansas 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|220px|right|thumb|1955 map showing planned Interstate highways through Topeka]]
The section of I-470 that now runs along the Kansas Turnpike was opened in 1956, and was the first part of I-470 to be built.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Big Impact Seen For Local Area In Superhighway | newspaper = Lawrence Daily Journal-World | date = October 24, 1956 | pages = 1<U+2013>2 }}</ref><ref name="LJW-102056">{{cite news | title = KTA Officials Say Traffic Heavy on Pike This Morning | newspaper = Lawrence Daily Journal-World | date = October 20, 1956 }}</ref> After the founding of the [[Interstate Highway System]] that same year, several Interstate freeways were planned through Topeka, including I-70, I-335, and I-470.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|title=1957-1958 Kansas highway map|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> Construction began on I-470 after I-70's completion through Topeka. The segment of the I-470 freeway from the I-70 interchange to the Kansas Turnpike, most of which is concurrent with US 75 was still under construction in 1960.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|title=1960 Kansas highway map|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> The next year, in 1961, the unfinished section of I-470 was opened to traffic.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|title=1961 Kansas highway map|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|title=1962 Kansas highway map|accessdate=February 22, 2011}}</ref> Since completion of the freeway, the route has not been changed. It retains its original routing.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|title=2011 Kansas highway map|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}</ref>
