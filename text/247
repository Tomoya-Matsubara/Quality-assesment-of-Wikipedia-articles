==Description==
When asked why Hollywood was chosen as a single in an interview with the ''[[BBC News]]'' website, Marina said:
{{cquote|I'm saying: "This is who I was. Hollywood infected my brain and I really valued the wrong things in life, but I changed dramatically." 

This obsession with celebrity culture is really unhealthy. I don't want to live my life like that, and I don't want to be a typical pop star..|20px|20px|Marina|''BBC News''<ref name="BBC">Savage, Mark(1 June 2009). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8437856.stm BBC Sound of 2010: Marina and the Diamonds ]", [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 2010-14-01.</ref>}}

Marina told ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'': "That track is a sarcastic and cynical take on everything that's commercial about America. I love the country and people dearly and can't wait to tour there but I hate the way it brainwashes you. I am seduced by its pop culture but I don't want my brain to be infected." <ref> [http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=18430 Hollywood Songfacts] </ref>

==Critical reception==
[[Digital Spy]] music editor Nick Levine wrote that "Hollywood" has a "whopping great chorus, cascading synths - as glittery and eighties as one of [[Pat Evans|Pat Butcher's]] party frocks, no less - and intriguing lyrics about being 'obsessed with the mess that's America'." He also went on to say that the song "manages to sound like an absolute smash without sacrificing Marina's quintessential, well, Marinaness."<ref>{{cite news |last=Levine |first=Nick |title=Music - Singles Reviews - Marina and the Diamonds: 'Hollywood' - Digital Spy |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a199858/marina-and-the-diamonds-hollywood.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2010}}</ref> Fraser McAlpine of the [[BBC]] Chart Blog called the track an "properly amazing pop song" and stated that "the level of insight displayed about America, culturally and politically, is on a par with the [[Razorlight]] song about America (the name of which temporarily escapes me). Marina, for all that she's spotted that Hollywood is something of an upsettingly fake place, with scope for quite exciting things to happen, seems to get as much enjoyment out of just singing the word as she does from puncturing its ego."<ref>{{cite news |last=McAlpine |first=Fraser |title=BBC - Chart Blog: Marina & The Diamonds - 'Hollywood' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2010/01/marina_the_diamonds_hollywood.shtml |work=[[BBC]] Chart Blog |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=28 January 2010}}</ref>
