==Baseball career==
===Early life and minor leagues===
Lewis Robert Wilson was born April 26, 1900 in the [[Pennsylvania]] steel mill town of [[Ellwood City]], north of [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name="Hack Wilson Belted Homers, Hecklers with Equal Gusto"/>  His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an unemployed drifter from [[Philadelphia]]; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker.  His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 his mother died of [[appendicitis]] at the age of 24.{{sfn|Parker|2000|p=7}}  

In 1916 Lewis left school to take a job at a locomotive factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars a week.<ref name="Hack Wilson Belted Homers, Hecklers with Equal Gusto"/> Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. One sportswriter later observed that he was "built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents."<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com.sa/books?id=DrQB0z6nEfcC&lpg=PA58&dq=hack%20wilson%20beer%20barrel&pg=PA58#v=onepage&q=hack%20wilson%20beer%20barrel&f=false |title=Baseball's most wanted II: the top 10 book of more bad hops, screwball players, and other oddities |author=Conner, Floyd |publisher=Books.Google.com |year=2003 |work= |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref> While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time,<ref name="Fouled Away: The Baseball Tragedy of Hack Wilson">Parker, Clifton Blue (2000).

In [[1921 Major League Baseball season|1921]] Wilson moved to [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]] to join the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the Class "D" [[Blue Ridge League]].<ref name="Fouled Away: The Baseball Tragedy of Hack Wilson"/><ref name="Hack Wilson minor league statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=wilson001lew |title=Hack Wilson minor league statistics |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref> After breaking his leg while sliding into [[home plate]] during his first professional game,<ref name="Fouled Away: The Baseball Tragedy of Hack Wilson"/> he was moved from the catcher's position to the outfield.<ref name="Fouled Away: The Baseball Tragedy of Hack Wilson"/> In [[1923 Major League Baseball season|1923]], playing for the "B" division [[Portsmouth Truckers]], he led the [[Virginia League]] in hitting with a .388 [[batting average]].<ref name="Hack Wilson minor league statistics"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/leader.cgi?type=bat&id=14479 |title=1923 Virginia League Batting Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> Late in the season, [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] manager [[John McGraw]] purchased his contract from Portsmouth for $10,500.<ref name="Hack Wilson statistics"/>

===New York Giants===
Wilson made his major league debut with the Giants on September 29, 1923, and became the starting [[left fielder]] the following season after [[Billy Southworth]] fell into a hitting slump.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hack Wilson Cost The Giants Price Of A Bag Of Peanuts |agency=King Features Syndicate |work=Rochester Evening Journal |page=8 |date=11 September 1924 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4htgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CG4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2863,4015960&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref>  

Multiple stories exist to explain the origin of his nickname: By one account, a New York newspaper held a nicknaming contest; the winning entry was "Hack" because Wilson reminded many fans of another stocky athlete, the popular wrestler [[Georg Hackenschmidt]].<ref name="Hack Wilson Belted Homers, Hecklers with Equal Gusto"/> In another version, McGraw is said to have remarked that Wilson's physique was reminiscent of a "hack" (slang for [[taxicab]] in that era). Giants teammate [[Bill Cunningham (outfielder)|Bill Cunningham]] claimed that the nickname was based on Wilson's resemblance to [[Hack Miller (catcher)|Hack Miller]], a catcher with the Chicago Cubs.  The ''[[New York Times]]'' printed the first documented usage of "Hack" on June 10, 1924.{{sfn|Parker|2000|p=29}}

By mid-July Wilson was ranked second in the [[National League]] (NL) in hitting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hack Wilson Is The Old-Style Type Of Bull-Necked Slugger |agency= |work=The Washington Reporter |page= |date=17 July 1924 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QS5eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TWANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1602,798237&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> He ended the season with a .295 average along with 10 [[home run]]s and 57 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs) as the Giants clinched the NL [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]].<ref name="Hack Wilson statistics"/> In the [[1924 World Series]] he averaged only .233 as the Giants lost to the [[1924 Washington Senators season|Washington Senators]] in seven games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1924_WS.shtml |title=1924 World Series |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref>

Early in the [[1925 New York Giants (MLB) season|1925]] season Wilson hit the longest home run on record at [[Ebbets Field]] against the [[1925 Brooklyn Robins season|Brooklyn Robins]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Homers By Hack Wilson And Kelly Play Important Part In Giants Win Over Robins |agency= |work=The Lewiston Daily Sun |page=9 |date=20 April 1925 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w7EgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XmkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1620,1529214&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> but fell into a slump in May, and was replaced in left field by [[Irish Meusel]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Irish Meusel In Giants' Outfield |agency= |work=The Norwalk Hour |page=12 |date=30 May 1925 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=H94gAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9GwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3248,1840538&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> On July 2 he hit two home runs in one [[inning]], tying [[Ken Williams (baseball)|Ken Williams]]'s major league record set in [[1922 Major League Baseball season|1922]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Hack Wilson Ties Record With Two Home Runs In One Inning |agency=Associated Press |work=Reading Eagle |page=18 |date=2 July 1925 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wokhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yZcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6405,388132&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> but his hitting slump continued. In August McGraw told reporters that he had "...made the mistake of rushing [Wilson] along,"{{sfn|Parker|2000|p=39}} and sent him to the Giants' minor league affiliate, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]. At season's end a front office oversight left him unprotected on the Toledo roster, and the last-place Chicago Cubs acquired him on [[Major League Baseball transactions#Waivers|waivers]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=-zIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38&dq=hack+wilson+baseball+digest#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Will They Beat 56 In '56? |author=Dexter, Charles |publisher=Books.Google.com |date=June 1956 |work=Baseball Digest |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref>  "They let go the best outfielder I ever played alongside," said Giants right fielder [[Ross Youngs]], "and they're going to regret it."{{sfn|Parker|2000|p=44}}

===Glory years with the Cubs===
Wilson regained his form as the Cubs' [[center fielder]] in [[1926 Chicago Cubs season|1926]] and soon became a favorite of Chicago fans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Take Hack For Your Example |agency= |work=The Toledo News-Bee |page=14 |date=19 May 1926 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1JFXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=oUQNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2104,2371472&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> On May 24 he hit the center field scoreboard with one of the longest home runs in [[Wrigley Field]] history as the Cubs came from behind to defeat the [[1926 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Cubs Overcome Braves |agency= |work=Reading Eagle |page=14 |date=24 May 1926 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AaAhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7pkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3509,5215055&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> Later that evening he made news again when he was arrested during a police raid of a [[Prohibition]]-era [[speakeasy]] while trying to escape through the rear window.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hack Wilson Found In "Beer Parlor" Is Taken to Lock Up |agency=INS |work=The Telegraph-Herald |page= |date=24 May 1926 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fTVFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=brsMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5416,1339434&dq=hack+wilson&hl=en}}</ref> He ended the season with a league-leading 21 home runs along with 36 [[double (baseball)|double]]s, 109 RBIs, a .321 batting average, and a .406 [[on-base percentage]].<ref name="Hack Wilson statistics"/> The Cubs improved to fourth place, and Wilson ended the year ranked fifth in voting for the NL's [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1926.shtml#NLmvp |title=1926 National League Most Valuable Player Award |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref>

Another strong performance followed in [[1927 Chicago Cubs season|1927]] as Wilson once again led the league in home runs.  Although the Cubs were in first place heading into the final month of the season, the team faltered and again finished fourth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1927-schedule-scores.shtml |title=1927 Chicago Cubs |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> Wilson posted a .318 average with 30 home runs and 129 RBIs,<ref name="Hack Wilson statistics"/> and led NL outfielders with 400 [[putouts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1927-fielding-leaders.shtml |title=1927 National League Fielding Leaders |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=28 February 2011}}</ref> He led the NL in home runs for a third consecutive year in [[1928 Chicago Cubs season|1928]] with 31, along with 120 RBIs and a .313 average as the Cubs improved to third place.<ref name="Hack Wilson statistics"/>

Wilson had a combative streak and frequently initiated fights with opposing players and fans.

====1930: The peak====
Wilson's [[1930 Chicago Cubs season|1930]] season, aided by a lively ball wound with special Australian wool, is considered one of the best single-season hitting performances in baseball history.<ref name="Hack Wilson Belted Homers, Hecklers with Equal Gusto"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hibavg4.shtml |title=League by League Totals for Batting Average |publisher=Baseball Almanac |accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> By the middle of July he had accumulated 82 RBIs.

<blockquote>"Talent isn't enough.  You need common sense and good advice.  If anyone tries to tell you different, tell them the story of Hack Wilson. ... Kids in and out of baseball who think because they have talent they have the world by the tail.  It isn't so.  Kids, don't be too big to accept advice.  Don't let what happened to me happen to you."{{sfn|Parker|2000|p=2}}</blockquote>
