== Description ==
[[File:Seminole-Indian Village.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Historic homes in the Indian Village neighborhood.]]

The district has a number of architecturally-significant homes built in the early 20th century.  A number of the houses have been substantially restored, and many others well kept up.  Bordering Indian Village to the west is West Village, with additional historic homes, townhouses and apartments.<ref name=Simmons/>

Many of the homes were built by prominent architects, such as [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]], [[Louis Kamper]] and [[William Stratton (Architect)|William Stratton]], for some of the area's most prominent citizens, such as [[Edsel Ford]]. A lot of homes are very large, with some over 12,000 square feet (1,100 m<U+00B2>). Many have a [[carriage house]], with some of those being larger than an average suburban home. Some of the houses also have large amounts of [[Pewabic Pottery]] tiles.<ref name=Simmons>
