'''Stephen Jones Chamberlin''' was a [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] in the [[United States Army]] who served during [[World War II]] as [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, the staff officer in charge of plans and operations.  Born in Spring Hill, Kansas on 23 December 1889, he was 1912 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]]. During [[World War I]], he was aide-de-camp to [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[David C. Shanks]], the Port of Embarkation commander at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], for which he was one of twelve Army officers who received the [[Navy Cross]].

After the war he attended the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, and served on the staff of the Chief of Infantry in the [[War Department]]. He attended the [[Army War College]] and was posted to the staff of the Army's Hawaiian Division at [[Fort Shafter]], Hawaii, as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3.

In 1938, he became assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of [[United States War Department|War Department]] General Staff. He became involved in the vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses as the US rearmed prior to its entry into [[World War II]]. In January 1942, he was sent to Australia, where he became Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, at General MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]]. In this role he was responsible for planning and overseeing execution of MacArthur's major operations, including the [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]], [[Philippines campaign (1944<U+2013>45)|Philippines]] and [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo]] campaigns.

Chamberlin Was Director Of The Intelligence Division, G-2, on the War Department General Staff from 1946 to 1948, when he became commander of the [[Fifth United States Army|Fifth Army]]. He retired in September, 1951, and was then employed as chief of security for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s Arnold Engineering Development Center at [[Arnold Air Force Base]], Tennessee. He died on 23 October 1971.

==Early life==
Stephen Jones Chamberlin was born in [[Spring Hill, Kansas]] on 23 December 1889.<ref name="bio">{{harvnb|Ancell|Miller|1996|p=50}}</ref> He was appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], which he entered on 2 March 1908 and from which he graduated on 12 June 1912.<ref name="Callum 1920">{{harvnb|Callum|1920|pp=1600-1601}}</ref>

Chamberlin was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant (United States)|Second Lieutenant]] in the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry]], which was then stationed at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]]. In May 1914, the regiment moved to [[El Paso, Texas]]. He transferred to the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry]] on 1 February 1915 and served at [[Fort William McKinley]] in the [[Philippines]]. He was promoted to [[First Lieutenant (United States)|First Lieutenant]] on 1 July 1916, becoming a battalion adjutant on 14 October. He was assistant to the post quartermaster from 31 October 1916 to 1 January 1917, and then Post Exchange Officer from 20 December 1916 to 9 June 1917. He was promoted to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on 15 May 1917 and was  acting Regimental Adjutant from 9 June to 1 September 1917.<ref name="Callum 1920"/>

==World War I==
With the United States now involved in [[World War I]], Chamberlin became aide-de-camp to [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[David C. Shanks]], the Port of Embarkation commander at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. Chamberlin was also the officer in charge of troop movements.<ref name="Callum 1920"/> On 2 March 1918 Chamberlin married General Shank's daughter Sarah Chapman at [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, New York]] on the corner of [[Madison Avenue (Manhattan)|Madison Avenue]] and [[44th Street (Manhattan)|East 44th Street]], in a simple ceremony  attended only by Sarah's sister Katherine and Captain Maxwell Sullivan as best man.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title=Wed to Captain Chamberlin |date=5 March 1918 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10711FB3D5E10728DDDAC0894DB405B888DF1D3 |accessdate=20 May 2011 }}</ref>

Chamberlin was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] on 7 June 1918.<ref name="Callum 1920"/> For his "distinguished service in the line of his profession as Dispatch Officer at the Port of Embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey",<ref name="valour">{{cite web |title=Valor awards for Stephen J.

His citation read:
{{quote|The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Stephen J. Chamberlin, Major (Infantry), U.S. Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. As Acting Dispatch Officer at Port of Embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey, from November 15, 1917 to September 6, 1918, Major Chamberlin displayed marked ability in handling the movements of troops through the port, assigning units and detachments to camps, convoys, and ships, and by foresight, thorough organization, and hard work arranged for the smooth working of troop movements, prevented congestion at the camps and piers, thus enabling the transports to sail at the appointed time with the appropriate number of troops.<ref name="valour"/>}}

In September 1918, Shanks was appointed commander of the [[16th Infantry Division (United States)|16th Division]] at [[Camp Kearny]], California,<ref name="Shanks">{{harvnb|Callum|1920|pp=388-389}}</ref> and Chamberlin was appointed the division's Assistant Chief of Staff. To prepare for the role, he attended a course at the [[Army War College]]. Following the [[Armistice with Germany]], he was sent on a tour of the battlefields in France and Belgium.<ref name="Callum 1920"/>

==Between the wars==
In the aftermath of World War I, Chamberlin was reduced in rank to captain on 9 February 1919, but was promoted to major again on 1 July 1920. A year later he was posted to the [[Panama Canal Zone]], initially as transportation officer, and then with [[33rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|33rd Infantry]]. On returning to the United States in January 1922 he joined the staff of 19th Infantry Brigade at [[Fort McPherson]], Georgia. He was transferred to the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry]] at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia, on 17 February 1923.<ref name="Callum 1930">{{harvnb|Callum|1930|p=955}}</ref> 

From 1924 to 1925 he attended the [[Command and General Staff School]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, graduating as an Honor Graduate. Duty then followed with the III [[Corps Area]] from 30 June to July 5, 1925; with the [[National Guard]]  at [[Staunton, Virginia]] from 5 July 1925 to 1 July 1926; in the Office Chief of Infantry at [[Washington, D.C.]]; and at [[Camp Perry]], Ohio as Publicity Officer.<ref name="Callum 1930"/> He served on the staff of the Chief of Infantry in the [[War Department]] from 1926 to 1930, then commanded a battalion of the 22nd Infantry from 1930 to 1932.<ref name="Callum 1940">{{harvnb|Callum|1940|pp=254-255}}</ref>

Chamberlin attended the [[Army War College]] from July 1932 to June 1933. Upon graduation, he was posted to the staff of the Army's Hawaiian Division at [[Fort Shafter]], Hawaii, serving as Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3. After more than 15 years as a major, he was finally promoted to [[lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] on 1 August 1935. On returning to the United States in July 1936, he became Assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics for the high schools of [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref name="Callum 1940"/>

==World War II==
In 1938 Chamberlin became assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of [[United States War Department|War Department]] General Staff.<ref name="Callum 1950">{{harvnb|Callum|1950|pp=161-162}}</ref> At this time the United States was embarking on a military build up in response to a worsening international situation, which culminated in the outbreak of [[World War II]] on 1 September 1939. A major component of this build up was a vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses. Some $175 million was allocated to construction under the Expansion Program, as it became known.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|pp=74-75, 108}}</ref>

On 7 May 1940, the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, Major General [[Richard C. Moore]], G-4 of the War Department General Staff asked for an estimate of the cost to house an additional 1,200,000 men and was baulked at the estimate he received of $800 per head.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|p=117}}</ref> To save on the cost of cantonments, Moore decided not paint them. Chamberlin disagreed on the grounds that paint would reduce maintenance costs. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Roosevelt]] intervened and directed that the buildings be painted. As a result, an order was placed for {{convert|96500|usgal}} of paint, resulting in an $11 million budget shortfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|pp=172-173}}</ref> Chamberlin was promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on 14 February 1941.<ref name="Callum 1950"/> Commenting after the war on the construction program, he wrote:
{{quote|Actually a phenomenal standard was set, one in which all Americans can glory. As far as wasting a few dollars was concerned, the construction effort cannot hold a candle to [[Lend-Lease]], the [[Marshall Plan]], or the [[Military Assistance Program]]. Had it not been for the courageous performance of those in charge of the War Department in the emergency, we might well have been defeated, and how then would the expenditure of a few millions have loomed in the long-range picture?<ref>{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|p=295}}</ref>}}

In January 1942, Chamberlin was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff, G-4, of US Army Forces in Australia, arriving by air from Washington, D.C., on 9 January. He soon became Chief of Staff of US Army Forces in Australia, first under Major General [[Julian F. Barnes]], and then under his successor, [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George Brett (general)|George H. Brett]].<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|p=9}}</ref> Chamberlin was promoted to [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] on 15 February 1942.<ref name="Callum 1950"/> [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] arrived in Australia on 17 March to become [[Supreme Commander]] of the newly established [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] (SWPA), which now included the US Army Forces in Australia.<ref>{{harvnb|Milner|1957|pp=18-23}}</ref> On 19 April, MacArthur formally established his General Headquarters (GHQ), and Chamberlin was appointed its Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47329460 |title=Allied Command |newspaper=[[Perth_Gazette|The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879-1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=22 April 1942 |accessdate=21 May 2011 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

As G-3, Chamberlin was one of the most highly rated members of the GHQ staff, although not being part of the "Bataan Gang" - the group of officers who had escaped with MacArthur from the Philippines - made him something of an outsider at GHQ.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2011|pp=215, 352}}</ref> Chamberlin was responsible for planning and overseeing execution of MacArthur's major operations, including the [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]], [[Philippines campaign (1944<U+2013>45)|Philippines]] and [[Borneo Campaign (1945)|Borneo]] campaigns. One member of the staff later recalled:
{{quote|Chamberlin, G-3, was an outstanding staff planner: quiet, unassuming, methodical, determined, aggressive in defending his position when challenged. He had a fine sense of timing and integration. He manipulated his three separate planning teams to move down parallel paths toward the same objective, or, when necessary, to move along divergent paths to map out a change of direction. Once an objective had been defined in long-run terms, Chamberlin and his planners set the basic sequence of events. All major commanders participated in the planning process, with Chamberlin coordinating and adjusting to smooth out conflicts. Considering the huge distances involved and the necessity for working in the humid heat of equatorial islands, the performance was stupendous. The apparent ease that characterized the operations reflected the thoroughness of the planning process. On those occasions when MacArthur required a sudden and pressing shift of direction, Chamberlin delivered, not always with great patience. The deadlines were met with a finely turned operational plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1990|pp=245-246}}</ref>}}

Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin differed with one of his planners, Brigadier General [[Bonner Fellers]], over a proposed landing at [[Hansa Bay]]. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt that this would be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.<ref>{{harvnb|Taafe|1998|pp=77-78}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1991|p=73}}</ref>

One of Chamberlin's challenges was working with the Australians. Their decentralised mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of great frustration, as it was difficult to extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General [[Frank Berryman]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2011|pp=231-233}}</ref>

When MacArthur began looking for a new chief of staff to replace Lieutenant General [[Richard K. Sutherland]] in 1945, he consider but rejected giving the post to Chamberlin.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogers|1991|p=244}}</ref> Chamberlin became Deputy Chief of Staff in February 1946, and was briefly acting as Chief of Staff from 2 May to 10 June 1946. For his services in the Southwest Pacific and the [[Occupation of Japan]], Chamberlin was awarded three [[Army Distinguished Service Medal]]s and the [[Silver Star]].<ref name="Callum 1950"/> In September 1946, he was one of five American major generals who was  made  an  honorary [[Commander  of Order  of  the  British  Empire]] in   the  Military  Division for  his  work with US Army Forces in Australia and GHQ SWPA.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46168084 |title=AMERICANS HONOURED. |newspaper=[[Perth_Gazette|The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879-1954)]] |location=Perth, WA  |date=7 September 1946 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} The other four major generals were [[Hugh J. Casey]], [[Leif Sverdrup]], [[Lester Whitlock]], and [[Charles Willoughby]].</ref>

==Later life==
From June 1946 to October 1948 Chamberlin Was Director Of The Intelligence Division, G-2, on the War Department General Staff. He commanded the [[Fifth United States Army|Fifth Army]] from 1948 to 1951, receiving promotion to lieutenant general on 24 January 1948.<ref name="Callum 1950"/>  In 1949 he was chairman of a general officer committee that researched the role of race in the Army, and produced a report favoring the continuation of segregation and the maintenance of a quota that limited the number of [[African-Americans]] who could serve in uniform.<ref>{{harvnb|MacGregor|1981|pp=429-430}}</ref>

He retired in September, 1951, and was then employed as chief of security for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s Arnold Engineering Development Center at [[Arnold Air Force Base]], Tennessee.<ref>{{cite news |title=General Gets Security Post |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=22 December 1951}}</ref> He died at Hope Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach, Orange, California on 23 October 1971.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gen.
