The '''Adelaide 36ers''' are [[Adelaide]]'s men's professional [[basketball]] team, established as the Adelaide City Eagles when they joined the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) in [[1982]]. The Adelaide 36ers tally of four championships is equal with the [[Perth Wildcats]] as the most by any team in the NBL's history.



== Club history ==

The Adelaide 36ers were formerly known as the Adelaide City Eagles when they joined the [[NBL]] in [[1982]], and the club changed its name to the Adelaide 36ers in [[1983]] with the nickname reflecting the [[Adelaide]]'s settlement in [[1836]]. This is similar to [[Philadelphia]]'s NBA franchise [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]] adopting their nickname in reference to the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia, in [[1776]].

The Adelaide 36ers are currently sponsored by [http://www.pura.com.au/ Pura milk] and with the naming rights of Pura milk 36ers. Before this they were the West End 36ers (as in [[West End (beer)|West End]] Brewery).

The 36ers have reached the playoffs 17 times in 22 seasons, and on top of their four championships ([[1986]], [[1998]], [[1999]], [[2002]]), reached the Grand Final on two other occasions.

In April of [[2006]] the 36ers, the [[Adelaide Lightning]] [[WNBL]] team and the [[Distinctive Homes Dome]] went up for sale due to mishandling of debt owed to the government by the then owner BASA. The 36ers were allegedly priced at around $1 million. On [[July 25]], [[2006]], a consortium of Mal Hemmerling & Eddie Groves (current Brisbane Bullets and ABC Learning Centre owner) bought the Adelaide 36ers & the Distinctive Homes Dome for $3.95 million - with Mal Hemmerling in place as owner of the 36ers and Eddie Groves as the owner of the stadium.  The money for the sale went to the government to wipe out the debt owed by BASA.  BASA is now defunct and replaced by Basketball SA - focused solely on all Basketball in SA and no one competition.
