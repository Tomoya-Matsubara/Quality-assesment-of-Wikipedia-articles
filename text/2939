'''''Diderot''''' was one of the six {{sclass|Danton|battleship|4}} [[semi-dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s built for the [[French Navy]] in the late 1900s. Shortly after World War I began, the ship participated in the [[Battle of Antivari]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and helped to sink an [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[protected cruiser]]. She spent most of the rest of the war blockading the [[Straits of Otranto]] and the [[Dardanelles]] to prevent German, Austro-Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean. ''Diderot'' briefly participated in the [[occupation of Constantinople]] after the end of the war. She was modernized in 1922<U+2013>25 and subsequently became a [[training ship]]. The ship was condemned in 1936 and later sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]].

==Design and description==
Although the {{sclass|Danton|battleship|6}}s were a significant improvement from the preceding {{Sclass|Libert<U+00E9>|battleship|4}}, they were outclassed by the advent of the [[dreadnought]] well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, made them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean.<ref name=gg6>Gardiner & Gray, p. 196</ref>

''Diderot'' was {{convert|146.6|m|sp=us|ftin}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|25.8|m|sp=us|ftin}} and a full-load [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|9.2|m|sp=us|ftin}}. She displaced {{convert|19736|MT|LT|sp=us}} at [[deep load]] and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. The ship was powered by four [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] [[steam turbine]]s using steam generated by twenty-six [[Belleville boiler]]s. The turbines were rated at {{convert|22500|shp|lk=in}} and provided a top speed of around {{convert|19|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=gg6/> ''Diderot'', however, reached a top speed of {{convert|19.9|kn|lk=in}} on her [[sea trial]]s.<ref name=g0/> She carried a maximum of {{convert|2027|t|LT}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|3370|lk=in|nmi}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=gg6/>

''Diderot''{{'}}s main battery consisted of four [[305mm/45 Mod<U+00E8>le 1906 gun]]s mounted in two twin [[gun turret]]s, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve [[240mm/50 Mod<U+00E8>le 1902 gun]]s in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against [[torpedo boat]]s. These included sixteen {{convert|75|mm|abbr=on}} L/65 guns and ten {{convert|47|mm|abbr=on}} [[Hotchkiss gun]]s. The ship was also armed with two submerged {{convert|450|mm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s. The ship's [[waterline]] [[belt armor|armor belt]] was {{convert|270|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick and the main battery was protected by up to {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on|1}} of armor. The [[conning tower]] also had 300&nbsp;mm thick sides.<ref name=gg6/>

===Wartime modifications===
During the war 75&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship's two forward 240&nbsp;mm gun turrets.<ref name=m5>Meirat, p. 5</ref> During 1918, the elevation of the 240&nbsp;mm guns was increased which extended their range to {{convert|18000|m|yd|sp=us}}.<ref name=gg6/>

==Career==
Construction of ''Diderot'' began on 26 December 1906<ref name=g0>Gille, p. 120</ref> by [[Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire]] in [[Saint-Nazaire]] and the ship was [[Keel|laid down]] on 20 October 1907. She was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 April 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911<ref name=s5>Silverstone, p. 95</ref> The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron (''escadre'') of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Fleet]] when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between [[Provence]] and [[Tunisia]] in May<U+2013>June 1913<ref name=g8>Gille, p. 119</ref> and the subsequent [[Review (disambiguation)|naval review]] conducted by the [[President of France]], [[Raymond Poincar<U+00E9>]] on 7 June 1913.<ref name=m5/> Afterwards, ''Diderot'' joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October-December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914.<ref name=g8/>

===World War I===
In early August 1914, the ship cruised the [[Strait of Sicily]] in an attempt to prevent the German battlecruiser ''Goeben'' and the light cruiser ''Breslau'' from breaking out to the West. On 16 August 1914 the combined [[wikt:Anglo-French|Anglo-French]] Fleet under Admiral [[Auguste Bou<U+00E9> de Lapeyr<U+00E8>re]], including ''Voltaire'', made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea. The Allied ships encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Zenta}}, escorted by the [[destroyer]] {{SMS|Ulan}}, blockading the coast of [[Montenegro]]. There were too many ships for ''Zenta'' to escape, so she remained behind to allow ''Ulan'' to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of [[Bar, Montenegro]]. ''Voltaire'' subsequently participated in a number of raids into the Adriatic later in the year and patrolled the [[Ionian Islands]]. From December 1914 through 1917, the ship participated in the distant blockade of the Straits of Otranto while based in [[Corfu]]. In May 1918, ''Diderot'' became [[flagship]] of the First Division of the Second Squadron and was transferred that month to [[Mudros]] with her sister ships, {{ship|French battleship|Mirabeau||2}} and {{ship|French battleship|Vergniaud||2}}, to prevent ''Goeben'' from breaking out into the Mediterranean and remained there until the end of the war.<ref name=g8/>

===Postwar===
After the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October between the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople from 12 November to 12 December.<ref name=g8/> ''Diderot'' was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922<U+2013>25 to improve her underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in 1936. She was later sold for scrap and broken up in 1937.<ref name=g8/>
