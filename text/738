The '''Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu''' are a series of agitations that happened in the [[India]]n state of [[Tamil Nadu]] (formerly [[Madras State]] and part of [[Madras Presidency]]) during both pre- and post-Independence periods. The agitations involved several mass protests, riots, student and political movements in Tamil Nadu, and concerned the official status of [[Hindi]] in the state and in the [[Republic of India|Indian Republic]].

The first anti-Hindi agitation was launched in 1937, in opposition to the introduction of compulsory teaching of Hindi in the schools of Madras Presidency by the first [[Indian National Congress]] government led by [[C. Rajagopalachari]] (Rajaji). This move was immediately opposed by [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] (Periyar) and the opposition [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] (later [[Dravidar Kazhagam]]). The agitation, which lasted three years, was multifaceted and involved [[Fasting|fasts]], conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. The mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras [[John Erskine, Lord Erskine|Lord Erskine]] in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress Government in 1939.

Adoption of an official language for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the framing of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]] after [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India with English continuing as an associate official language for a period of fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations. 

As the day (26 January 1965) of switching over to Hindi as sole official language approached, the anti-Hindi movement gained momentum in Madras State with increased support from college students. On 25 January, a full-scale riot broke out in the southern city of [[Madurai]], sparked off by a minor altercation between agitating students and Congress party members. The riots spread all over Madras State, continued unabated for the next two months, and were marked by acts of violence, arson, looting, police firing and [[lathi]] charges. The Congress Government of the Madras State, called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons (by official estimates) including two policemen. To calm the situation, Indian Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation. 

The agitations of 1965 led to major political changes in the state. The DMK won the [[Madras State legislative assembly election, 1967|1967 assembly election]] and the Congress Party never managed to recapture power in the state since then. The Official Languages Act was eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress Government headed by [[Indira Gandhi]] to guarantee the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official languages. This effectively ensured the current "virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism" of the Indian Republic. There were also two similar (but smaller) agitations in 1968 and 1986 which had varying degrees of success.

The Indian National Congress won the [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1937|1937 elections]] in Madras Presidency. Rajaji became the Chief Minister on 14 July 1937. He was a supporter of propagating Hindi in South India. On 11 August 1937,<ref name="venu2">{{cite book | first= E.Es. | last=Venu| authorlink=| coauthors= | origyear=| year=1979| title= Why South opposes Hindi|edition= | publisher=Justice Publications| location= | id= | pages=54| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=83xIAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> within a month of coming to power, he announced his intention to introduce Hindi language teaching in secondary schools by issuing a policy statement.<ref name="more"/>  On 21 April 1938, he issued a government order (G.O.) making the teaching of Hindi compulsory in 125 [[secondary school]]s in the Presidency. Periyar and the opposition Justice Party led by [[A. T. Panneerselvam]] immediately opposed the move. They started state wide protests against Rajaji and Hindi. 

The agitation was backed by Periyar's [[Self-Respect Movement]] and Justice Party. It also had the support of Tamil scholars like [[Maraimalai Adigal]], Somasundara Bharathi, K. Appadurai, Mudiyarasan and Ilakkuvanar. In December 1937, Tamil Saivite scholars were among the first to announce their opposition to the Hindi teaching in the ''Saiva Sidhandha Maha Samaja'' conference at [[Velur, Tamil Nadu|Velur]].<ref name="saivite1">{{cite journal|last=Venkatachalapathy|first=A.

The ruling Congress Party was divided on the Hindi issue. While Rajaji and his supporters stuck to their position, [[S. Satyamurti|Sathyamurti]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]] were against it. They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes. But Rajaji was firm in his stance. The police response to the agitation grew progressively brutal in 1939. During the agitation, a total of 1,198 protesters were arrested and out of them 1,179 were convicted (73 of those jailed were women and 32 children accompanied their mothers to prison).<ref name="sarkar">{{cite book | first=Tanika| last=Sarkar| authorlink=| coauthors= | origyear=| year=2008| title=Women and social reform in modern India: a reader |edition= | publisher=Indiana University Press| location= | isbn= 0253220491, ISBN 978-0-253-22049-3| pages=396| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JLGBUEs74n4C}}</ref> Periyar was fined 1,000 Rupees and sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment for inciting "women to disobey the law" (he was released within six months on 22 May 1939 citing medical grounds)<ref name="ravichandran176">{{Harvnb|Ravichandran|1982|p=176}}</ref> and Annadurai was jailed for four months.<ref name="baliga2">{{cite book | first= B.

==Agitations of 1946-50==
During 1946-50, there were sporadic agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move.<ref name="williams">{{cite book | first=Rohit | last=Wanchoo| first2=Mukesh | last2=Williams| authorlink=| coauthors= | origyear=| year=2007| title= Representing India: literatures, politics, and identities |edition= | publisher=Oxford University Press| location= | isbn=0195692268, ISBN 978-0-19-569226-6| pages=73| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3uYTAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The largest anti-Hindi agitations in this period occurred in 1948-50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under [[O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar|Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar]] complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948-49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi for the promotion of students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like [[M. P. Sivagnanam]] and [[V. Kalyanasundaram|Thiru. Vi. Ka]], who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938-40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the [[Governor-General of India]]) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 August Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950-51. Students who did not want to learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.<ref name="ramaswamy421"/><ref name="ravichandran177">{{Harvnb|Ravichandran|1982|pp=177<U+2013>179}}</ref><ref name="ramaswamy522"/><ref name="vasantha">{{Harvnb|Kandasamy|Smarandache|2005| pp=108<U+2013>110}}</ref>

== Official languages and the Indian Constitution ==

The [[Constituent Assembly of India|Indian Constituent Assembly]] was established on 9 December 1946, for drafting a [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] when India became independent. The Constituent Assembly witnessed fierce debates on the language issue. The adoption of a "National Language", the language in which the constitution was to be written in and the language in which the proceedings of the assembly were to be conducted were the main linguistic questions debated by the framers of the Constitution.<ref name="hindu2">{{cite news

[[Hindi]] in [[Devanagari]] script would be the official language of the Indian Union. For fifteen years, English would also be used for all official purposes (Article 343). A language commission could be convened after five years to recommend ways to promote Hindi as the sole official language and to phase out the use of English (Article 344). Official communication between states and between states and the Union would be in the official language of the union (Article 345).English would be used for all legal purposes - in court proceedings, bills, laws, rules and other regulations (Article 348).The Union was duty bound to promote the spread and usage of Hindi (Article 351).

India became independent on 15 August 1947 and the Constitution was adopted on 26 January 1950.

In 1955, in-house Hindi training was started for all ministries and departments of the central government.

As provided for by Article 343, Nehru appointed the First Official Language Commission under the chairmanship of [[B. G. Kher]] on 7 June 1955. The commission delivered its report on 31 July 1956. It recommended a number of steps to eventually replace English with Hindi (The report had dissenting notes from two non-Hindi members - [[P.

After two years of deliberations, the Pant Committeee submitted its recommendations to the President on 8 February 1959. It recommended that Hindi should be made the primary official language with English as the subsidiary one. The Kher Commission and the Pant Committee recommendations were condemned and opposed by from non Hindi politicians like Suniti Kumar Chatterji, [[Frank Anthony]] and P. Subbarayan. The Academy of Telugu opposed the switch from English to Hindi in a convention held in 1956. Rajaji, once a staunch supporter of Hindi, organised an All India Language Conference (attended by representatives of Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Assamese, Oriya, Marathi, Kannada and Bengali languages) on 8 March 1958 to oppose the switch and declared "Hindi is as much foreign to non-Hindi speaking people as English is to the protagonists of Hindi."<ref name="annamalai1"/><ref name="simpson"/><ref name="fishman">{{cite book | first=Joshua A. | last=Fishman| first2=Andrew W.| last2=Conrad|first3=Alma| last3=Rubal-Lopez|authorlink=| coauthors= | origyear=| year=1996| title= Post-imperial English: status change in former British and American colonies, 1940-1990 |edition= | publisher=Walter de Gruyter| location= | isbn= 3110147548 ISBN 978-3-11-014754-4| pages=564| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SIu244rlVu8C&pg=PA564}}</ref>

As the opposition to Hindi grew stronger, Nehru tried to reassure the concerns of non-Hindi speakers. Speaking in the parliamentary debate on a bill introduced by Anthony to include English in the [[Languages with official status in India#The languages of the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution|Eighth Schedule]], Nehru gave an assurance to them (on 7 August 1959):<ref name="timeline1"/>

<blockquote>I believe also two things. As I just said, there must be no imposition. Secondly, for an indefinite period - I do not know how long - I should have, I would have English as an '''associate, additional language''' which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond - the Government, I mean - in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English.

==DMK's anti-Hindi policies==
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) which split from the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1949, inherited the anti-Hindi policies of its parent organisation. DMK's founder Annadurai had earlier participated in the anti-Hindi agitations during 1938-40 and in the 1940s. In July 1953, the DMK launched an agitation for changing the name of a town - Dalmiapuram - to [[Kallakudi]]. They claimed that the town's name (after [[Ramkrishna Dalmia]]) symbolised the exploitation of South India by the North.<ref name="mills">{{cite book | first=James H.| last=Mills| first2=Satadru| last2=Sen| authorlink=| coauthors= | origyear=| year=2004| title=Confronting the body: the politics of physicality in colonial and post-colonial India|edition= | publisher=Anthem Press| location= | isbn= 1843310333 ISBN 978-1-84331-033-4| pages=151| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2hIUBioZHHQC&pg=PT151}}</ref><ref name="sangam">{{cite web

== Official Languages Act of 1963 ==
As the deadline stipulated in Part XVII of the Constitution for switching to Hindi as primary official language approached, the central government stepped up its efforts to spread Hindi's official usage. In 1960, compulsory training for Hindi typing and stenography was started. The same year, India's president [[Rajendra Prasad]] acted on the Pant Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi, imparting Hindi education to government employees and other efforts for propagating Hindi.<ref name ="timeline1"/>

To give legal status to Nehru's assurance of 1959, the [[s:en:Official Languages Act, 1963|Official Languages Act]] was passed in 1963.<ref name=Duncan_B._Forrester>{{Cite journal| first = Duncan B.|last =Forrester| title = The Madras Anti-Hindi Agitation, 1965: Political Protest and its Effects on Language Policy in India | journal = Pacific Affairs| volume = 39| issue = 1/2| pages = 19<U+2013>36| publisher = Pacific Affairs, University of British Columbia| year = 1996| url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/2755179 |accessdate = 23 November 2009}}</ref> In Nehru's own words:
<blockquote>This is a Bill, in continuation of what has happened in the past, to remove a restriction which had been placed by the Constitution on the use of English after a certain date i.e. 1965. It is just to remove that restriction that this is placed.<ref name ="annamalai1"/></blockquote>

The Bill was introduced in Parliament on 21 January 1963. Opposition to the Bill came from DMK members who objected to the usage of the word "may" instead of "shall" in section 3 of the Bill. That section read: "the English language '''may'''...continue to be used in addition to Hindi". The DMK argued was that the term "may" could be interpreted as "may not" by future administrations. They feared that the minority opinion would not be considered and non Hindi speakers' views would be ignored. On 22 April, Nehru assured the parliamentarians that, for that particular case "may" had the same meaning as "shall". The DMK then demanded, if that was the case why "shall" was not used instead of "may". Leading the opposition to the Bill was Annadurai (then a Member of the [[Rajya Sabha]]). He pleaded for an indefinite continuation of the ''status quo'' and argued that continued use of English as official language would "distribute advantages or disadvantages evenly" among Hindi and non-Hindi speakers. The Bill was passed on 27 April without any change in the wording. As he had warned earlier, Annadurai launched state wide protests against Hindi.<ref name="annamalai1"/><ref name="rajagopalan"/><ref name="annadurai">{{cite book | first= C.

Nehru died in May 1964 and Lal Bahadur Shastri became Prime Minister of India. Shastri and his senior cabinet members [[Morarji Desai]] and [[Gulzari Lal Nanda]] were strong supporters of Hindi being the sole official language.

On 16 February, 55 MPs from 8 different states publicly expressed their disapproval of any change in the Language policy. On 19 February, 19 MPs from [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]] voiced their opposition for change and on 25 February, 106 Congress MPs met the Prime Minister to request him not to amend the Act. However, Congress MPs from Madras did not debate the issue on the Parliament floor but met the Prime Minister on 12 March. Congress and opposition parties hesitated to debate the issue in Parliament as they did not wish to make their bitter divisions on public. On 22 February at a meeting in Congress Working Committee, [[K. Kamaraj]] pressed for the amendment to Official Languages Act, but received instant opposition from Morarji Desai, [[Jagjivan Ram]] and [[Ram Subhag]]. The Congress working committee finally agreed to a resolution which amounted to slowing down of Hindi-isation, strong implementation of the [[Three-language formula|three language formula]] in Hindi and non-Hindi speaking states, and conduct of the public services exam in all regional languages. These decisions were agreed upon during the Chief Ministers' meeting which was held on February 24.<ref name="Duncan B. Forrester"/>

The three language formula was not strictly enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession to the south was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort to follow through with that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, [[A. K. Sen]], [[Satyanarayan Sinha]], [[Mahavir Tyagi]], [[M. C. Chagla]] and [[S.K. Patil|S. K. Patil]] and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on August 25. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing [[Khalistan movement#Punjabi Suba movement|Punjabi Suba movement]] and Kashmir crisis at that time.<ref name="Duncan B. Forrester"/>

===Amendment in 1967===
Shastri died in January 1966 and Indira Gandhi became prime minister. The election of 1967 saw Congress retaining power with a reduced majority. In Madras State, Congress was defeated and DMK came to power. In November 1967, a new attempt to amend the Bill was made. On 27 November,<ref name="mitra">{{cite book | first=Subrata Kumar| last=Mitra| authorlink= | coauthors= | origyear=| year= 2006| title=The puzzle of India's governance: culture, context and comparative theory|edition= | publisher=Routledge| location= | isbn= 0415348617, ISBN 978-0-415-34861-4| pages=118<U+2013>20 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=dnoW56MhJZMC&pg=P118}}</ref> the Bill was tabled in Parliament; it was passed on 16 December (by 205 votes to 41 against<ref name="chandra">{{cite book | first=Bipan| last=Chandra| authorlink= | coauthors= | origyear=| year= 1989| title=India after independence |edition= | publisher=Penguin Books| location= | id=| pages=96 | url =http://books.google.com/books?id=iAZuAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>).

==Agitation of 1968==
The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State were not satisfied with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula. However, with DMK in power, they hesitated to restart the agitation. The Tamil Nadu Students' Anti-Hindi Agitation council split into several factions. The moderate factions favored letting Annadurai and the government to deal with the situation. The extremist factions restarted the agitations. They demanded scrapping of the three language formula and an end to teaching of Hindi, abolishing the use of Hindi commands in the [[National Cadet Corps (India)|National Cadet Corps]] (NCC), banning of Hindi films and songs and closure of the ''Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachara Sabha'' - the Institution for propagation of Hindi in South India.

On 19 December 1967, the agitation was restarted. It turned violent in 21 December and acts of arson and looting were reported in the state. Annadurai defused the situation by accepting most of their demands.<ref name="mitra"/><ref name="madrasreport">{{cite book | first=| last=| authorlink= | coauthors= | origyear=| year= 1968| title= Madras State administration report|edition= | publisher=Govt of Madras| location= | id= | pages=116| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=1nAdAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> On 23 January 1968, a resolution was passed in the Legislative Assembly.

The Three-Language policy was scrapped and Hindi was eliminated from the curriculum. Only English and Tamil were to be taught, the use of Hindi commands in NCC was banned, Tamil was to be introduced as medium of instruction in all colleges and as the language of administration within five years, the Central Government was urged to end the special status accorded to Hindi in the Constitution and treat all languages equally, and was urged to provide financial assistance for development of all languages mentioned in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. These measures satisfied the agitators and normalcy returned by February 1968.<ref name="mitra"/>

The anti-Hindi agitations of 1937-40 and 1940-50 led to a change of guard in the Madras Presidency. The main opposition party to the Indian National Congress in the state, the Justice Party, came under Periyar's leadership on 29 December 1938.<ref name="vasantha2">{{Harvnb|Kandasamy|Smarandache|2005| p=109}}</ref> In 1944, the Justice Party was renamed as Dravidar Kazhagam. The political careers of many later leaders of the [[Dravidian Movement]], such as C. N. Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi, started with their participation in these agitations. The agitations stopped the compulsory teaching of Hindi in the state.<ref name="ramaswamy421"/><ref name="ramaswamy530"/> The agitations of the 1960s played a crucial role in the defeat of the Tamil Nadu Congress party in the [[Tamil Nadu state assembly election, 1967|1967 elections]] and the continuing dominance of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu politics.<ref name="hindu3"/> Many political leaders of the DMK and ADMK, like P. Seenivasan, K. Kalimuthu, Durai Murugan, Tiruppur. S. Duraiswamy, Sedapatti Muthaiah, K. Raja Mohammad, M. Natarajan and L. Ganesan, owe their entry and advancement in politics to their stints as student leaders during the agitations, which also reshaped the Dravidian Movement and broadened its political base, when it shifted from its earlier pro-Tamil (and anti-Brahmin) stance to a more inclusive one, which was both anti-Hindi and pro-English. Finally, the current two-language education policy followed in Tamil Nadu is also a direct result of the agitations.

<blockquote>[The anti-Hindi agitations knit] together diverse, even incompatible, social and political interests... Their common cause against Hindi had thrown together religious revivalists like Maraimalai Atikal (1876-1950) with avowed atheists like Ramasami and [[Bharathidasan]] (1891-1964); men who supported the Indian cause like [[V. Kalyanasundaram|T.V. Kalyanasundaram]] (1883-1953) and M. P. Sivagnanam with those who wanted to secede from India like Annadurai and M. Karunanidhi (b.1924); university professors like Somasundara Bharati (1879-1959) and M.S.

The anti-Hindi agitations ensured the passage of Official Languages Act of 1963 and its amendment in 1967, thus ensuring the continued use of English as an official language of India. They effectively brought about the "virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism" of the Indian Republic.<ref name="simpson"/><ref>{{cite book | title=The state of India's democracy| edition=| author=<U+0160>umit Ganguly, Larry Jay Diamond, Marc F.
