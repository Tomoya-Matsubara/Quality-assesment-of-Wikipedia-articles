'''''Oryctes''''' is a genus of flowering plants in the [[Solanaceae|nightshade family]] containing the single species '''''Oryctes nevadensis''''', which is known by the common name '''Nevada oryctes'''. This rare plant is native to a small area of desert straddling the [[California]] - [[Nevada]] border, where it grows in habitat with deep sand. It is difficult to estimate its abundance because the plant is only seen in years with certain rainfall amounts and temperature ranges.<ref>[http://heritage.nv.gov/sites/default/files/atlas/oryctnevad.pdf Nevada Natural Heritage Program Rare Plant Fact Sheet]</ref> This is a small annual herb growing from a taproot and producing sticky, scaly foliage, growing up to about 20 centimeters in maximum height. The leaves are 1 to 3 centimeters long, linear in shape to oval and divided into lobes, sometimes wavy along the edges. The [[inflorescence]]s are [[umbel]]s of a few tiny flowers each, emerging from leaf axils. The flower is purplish and rounded into an [[urn]] shape, measuring a few millimeters wide. The fruit is a spherical capsule containing several seeds.
