'''Dr. Joseph J. Romm''' was born on [[June 27]] [[1960]] in [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown, New York]].  Romm is an author and expert on [[global warming]], [[energy efficiency]], [[green energy]] technologies and green transportation technologies.  Romm's father, Al Romm, was a newspaper [http://www.romm.org/obit.html editor]. His mother, Ethel Grodzins Romm, is an [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=br_ss_hs/102-3943142-9156943?platform=gurupa&url=index%3Dblended&keywords=Ethel+Romm&Go.x=5&Go.y=7 author] and a retired engineer and [http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/lead-1213.html technology company executive]. 

Romm holds B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from [[M.I.T.]]

==Career==
===Current projects===
Romm is the executive director and founder of the [[non-profit]] Center for Energy and Climate Solutions, an organization based in Washington DC that helps businesses and U.S. States adopt high-leverage strategies for saving energy and cutting [[pollution]] and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.  He is also a principal of the [http://www.cap-e.com/mission/default.cfm#joe Capital E Group], which consults on [[technology assessment]] and sustainable design services for stationary [[fuel cells]] and other clean energy technologies.[http://www.cleanhouston.org/about/romm.htm]  Romm is also a Senior Fellow at the [[Center for American Progress]].  He lectures frequently[http://webcast.berkeley.edu/events/details.php?webcastid=15730] on energy technology and [[global warming]].

Romm is interviewed in the current documentary film ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'', directed by Chris Paine and narrated by [[Martin Sheen]].  Romm's forthcoming book on global warming, ''Hell or High Water'', is discussed below.

===Service at the Department of Energy===
Romm served as Acting Assistant Secretary at the U.S. [[Department of Energy]] Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy during 1997 and as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary from 1995 though 1998.  At the Department of Energy, Romm helped manage the largest program in the world for helping businesses develop and use advanced clean energy and distributed generation technologies to cut costs, increase reliability, and reduce pollution.[http://www.cleanhouston.org/about/romm.htm]

The program was aimed at the industrial, utility, transportation, and buildings sectors.  The program was the lead federal agency for developing technologies such as PEM fuel cells, microturbines, advanced cogeneration, superconductivity, building controls, photovoltaics and other renewables, and hydrogen production and storage. Romm was in charge of technology analysis for the Office. Romm initiated, supervised, and publicized a comprehensive technical analysis by five national laboratories of the energy technologies best able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions cost-effectively, "The Five Lab Study."

===Earlier projects===
Romm has taught at [[Columbia University]]'s [[School of International and Public Affairs]].  He also worked at the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].  Romm was the principal investigator for the [[National Science Foundation]] project, ''Future Directions for Hydrogen Energy Research and Education.''  He also performed the first environmental analysis of a system integrating cogenerating fuel cells, fly wheels, and [[power electronics]] aimed at achieving very high-availability power.[http://www.buildings.com/Articles/detail.asp?ArticleID=1766]

==Publications==
Romm has published a number of books on [[energy efficiency]] and reducing [[carbon emissions]] and pollution with green technologies, including ''[[The Hype about Hydrogen]]'', ''Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Gas Emissions'' (the first book to benchmark corporate best practices for using advanced energy technologies, including fuel cells, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions), ''Lean and Clean Management'', and ''The Once and Future Superpower'', and other topics.  He also wrote the National Commission on Energy Policy's report, "The Car and Fuel of the Future," (July 2004).  He also wrote the 1994 [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] Report: Greening the Building and the Bottom Line: Increasing Productivity Through Energy-Efficient Design. (ISBN 9996358097).  

Romm's forthcoming book on [[global warming]], expected [[March 1]] [[2007]] ([[William Morrow & Co]]), will be called ''Hell and High Water: Global Warming&mdash;The Solution and the Politics''.[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006117212X/102-3943142-9156943?v=glance&n=283155]  Romm also maintains a blog on global warming and related topics.[http://climateprogress.org/]

Romm has written and lectured widely on [[distributed energy]], clean technologies, business and environment issues and [[global warming]], including articles in [[Technology Review]], Issues in Science and Technology, [[Forbes]], [[Foreign Affairs]], [[The New York Times]], the [[L.A. Times]], [[Houston Chronicle]], [[The Washington Post]], [[Science (journal)]] and [[Scientific American]].  He co-authored, with Charles Curtis, "MidEast Oil Forever," the cover story of the April 1996 issue of the [[Atlantic Monthly]] that predicted higher oil prices within a decade and discussed alternative energy strategies.

Romm and Prof. Andrew A. Frank co-authored an article, "Hybrid Vehicles Gain Traction", published in the April 2006 issue of [[Scientific American]], in which they argue that [[hybrid cars]] that can be plugged into the electric grid ([[Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s) will soon become standard in the automobile industry.

"Global warming is going to transform this country and our transportation and the way we live our lives.  If we don't act pretty soon, in an intelligent fashion, then change will be forced upon us by the radically changed climate...  global warming is the issue of the century...."
