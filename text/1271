The game is included as a [[pack-in game]] with the Wii console in all territories except Japan,<ref name="ign">{{cite web|last=Casamassina|first=Matt| authorlink=Matt Casamassina|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/745/745708p1.html|publisher=[[IGN]]|title=Wii Sports Review|date= 2006-11-13|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> making it the first game included with the launch of a Nintendo console since ''[[Super Mario World]]'' or ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]]. ''Wii Sports'' is part of an ongoing series of games sometimes referred to as the ''[[Wii Series]]''.

The game is a collection of five [[sports]] simulations, designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of the [[Wii Remote]] to new players. The five sports included are [[tennis]], [[baseball]], [[Ten-pin bowling|bowling]], [[golf]], and [[boxing]]. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real life sports, such as swinging a [[tennis racket]].<ref name="GamePro">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/wii/games/reviews/86628.shtml|title= Review: Wii Sports|date=2006-11-16|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> The rules for each game are simplified in order to make them more accessible to new players.<ref name="ign"/> The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor player progress in the sports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GadgetGuide/story?id=2662149|title=Wii Sports -- Wii|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date= 2006-11-18|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref>

Overall, ''Wii Sports'' has been well received by critics, and has received awards from the gaming press and entertainment community.  Although not sold separately outside Japan, the game has been commercially successful. In Japan, it was the [[2007 in video gaming#Japan|best-selling game of 2007]] with 1,911,520 units sold.<ref name="Gamasutra">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=16914|title=Wii Sports Named Best Selling Game Of 2007 In Japan| publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|last=Jenkins|first=David| date=2008-01-11| accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref> By the end of 2007, ''Wii Sports'' sold 17.85&nbsp;million copies worldwide<U+2014>including bundled copies.<ref name="Nintendo-Sales">{{cite web|url= http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2008/080125e.pdf#page=6|format=PDF|title=Financial Results Briefing for the Nine-Month Period Ended December 2007|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-01-31|pages=6}}</ref> The game has been featured on [[television]] in Wii commercials,<ref name="WiiCommercial">{{cite web|url= http://media.wii.ign.com/articles/746/746137/vids_1.html|title=Official Wii commercial|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]| date=2006-11-14| accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> news reports,<ref name="ABC-Video1">{{cite web|url= http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3313748&affil=ktrk|title=Nintendo Adds an 'I' to Wiimbledon|publisher=[[ABC News]]| date=2007-06-25|accessdate=2008-02-02}}</ref> and other programming.<ref name="Conan">{{cite web|url= http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/02/conan-takes-on-serena-in-wii-tennis/|title=Conan takes on Serena in Wii Tennis|last=Miller| fisrt=Ross|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref><ref name="Mercer">{{cite web|url=http://www.n-sider.com/newsview.php?type=story&storyid=3106| title=Chr<U+00E9>tien delivers Wii knock-out punch|last=Bergmann|first=Dean|publisher=[[N-Sider]]|date=2007-02-02|accessdate=2008-11-21}}</ref> It has become a popular device for social gatherings and competitions among players of varying ages.<ref name="ABC-Video1"/><ref name="Seniors">{{cite web|url= http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/12/11/old_wii/|title=Seniors becoming old hands at Wii|publisher=[[American Public Media]]|work=[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]|last=Collins| first=Jennifer|date=2007-12-11| accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref><ref name="TennisTourn">{{cite web|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/755/755020p1.html|title=Wii Tennis Tourney in Melbourne|last=Kolan|first=Patrick|date=2007-01-11| publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
''Wii Sports'' consists of five separate sports games<U+2014>[[tennis]], [[baseball]], [[Ten-pin bowling|bowling]], [[golf]], and [[boxing]]<ref name="ign"/>&nbsp;<U+2014>accessed from the main menu.<ref name="GameTrailers">{{cite web|url= http://www.gametrailers.com/player.php?id=15056&type=mov&pl=game| title=Wii Sports Review|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|date= 2006-11-15|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> The games use the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and [[Wii Remote#Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]], [[baseball bat]] or [[bowling ball]].<ref name="GamePro"/> Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball consists of [[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[Pitcher|pitching]], with all of the fielding handled by the Wii.<ref name="GameTrailers"/>

Each game features a standard play mode, training mode, and multiple player options.<ref name="ign"/>  The standard play mode mimics each game's respective method of play: tennis, a [[Types of tennis match|doubles match]]; baseball, a simple game of pitching and batting; bowling, a ten-frame game; golf, playing on a [[golf course]]; and boxing, a three round boxing match.<ref name="Instructions">{{cite book|year=2006|title= Wii Sports Instruction Booklet|publisher= Nintendo}}</ref> Training mode is a single player option that allows a player to practice certain aspects of the sports.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> Every game has a single player or two-player mode, and some games allow up to four players via various methods.<ref name="Instructions"/> Bowling and golf allow for multiple players taking turns with a single Wii Remote,<ref name="GameTrailers"/> while tennis requires each player to have their own. The multiplayer mode for ''Wii Sports'' usually has the players competing against each other in the normal manner of the specific sports; the one exception is tennis which allows for two players to play together or against each other.

The in-game characters are taken from the Wii's [[Wii Menu#Mii Channel|Mii Channel]], which allows the user to create a [[Mii]], a customized [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]], that can be imported into games that support the feature. ''Wii Sports'' is the first Wii title to use this feature.<ref name="ign"/> Miis saved on the Wii will appear in the crowd during tennis and boxing games, as bowlers during bowling games, and as team members in baseball. The [[non-player character]]s in the game were also created using the Mii Channel toolset. Miis created on one Wii can be transferred onto the internal memory of a Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different save data.<ref name="Instructions"/>

===Player progress===
After a game, a player is awarded or penalized skill points based on performance, though some games do not calculate points during multiplayer sessions. The game keeps track of these points by charting them on a graph. After obtaining enough skill points in a sport, a player is awarded "pro level", along with a cosmetic feature for their Mii. A Mii newly turned pro will receive a message on the [[Wii Menu#Message Board|Wii Message Board]] notifying them. In single-player boxing and tennis, the size of the crowd grows with the player's skill level. ''Wii Sports'' also features a fitness test that calculates a player's fitness age. The test gauges the player's performance in three randomly chosen challenges from the training mode. Calculating the fitness age takes into account a player's balance, speed, and stamina. The test itself can only be taken once a day per Mii. Fitness age results are graphed over one, two, or three months. Daily results are posted on the Wii Message Board.<ref name="Instructions"/>

Before the [[E3|Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) Media and Business Summit of 2006, the first sport in the game was announced as ''Wii Sports: Tennis''. It was later announced, at Nintendo's press conference prior to E3 2006, that it would be part of a sports package.<ref name="10min"/> [[Satoru Iwata]] introduced this package as ''Wii Sports'', and stated that it would include tennis, golf, and baseball. The game was featured as both a video demonstration and an on-stage playable demo. The demo featured Iwata and [[Reggie Fils-Aime]] in a doubles tennis match against [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and Scott Dyer, a contest winner.<ref name="Conference"/> The other sports titles were on display at E3 and shared a similar naming convention to the tennis game such as, ''Wii Sports: Baseball'', ''Wii Sports: Golf'', and ''Wii Sports:Airplane''.<ref name="SportsPack">{{cite web|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/707/707417p1.html|title=E3 2006: Hands-On: Wii Sports Pack|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Iverson|first= Dan|date=2006-05-10|accessdate=2008-02-05}}</ref> At the time, baseball only featured a batting simulation.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://e3.gamespot.com/2006/story.html?sid=6150628|title=E3 06: Wii Sports: Baseball Hands-On|last=Ekberg|first=Brian| publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2006-05-10|accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> The airplane title was similar to ''[[Pilotwings]]'' and required the player to maneuver an airplane through rings within a time frame.<ref name="SportsPack"/> It was not included in the final game, but is believed to be part of a future game for the Wii titled ''Wii Motor Sports''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/826/826991.html|title=Wii Motor Sports Airplane|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=2008-02-08}}</ref> At the Nintendo World event on [[September 14]], [[2006]], Reggie Fils-Aime announced that ''Wii Sports'' would be included free with the Wii.

===Critical response===
''Wii Sports'' received positive reviews overall.<ref name="Meta"/><ref name="GameRank"/> Reviews complained about the game's graphics, but praised the ease of use. ''[[GamePro]]'' rated the graphics a 2.75 out of 5 and referred to them as "[[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]]-like".<ref name="GamePro"/> [[IGN]] rated the graphics 4 out of 10 and called them "generic" and "archaic".<ref name="ign"/> [[GameTrailers]] commented that the graphics were on par with that of the [[Nintendo 64]] system.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> ''GamePro'' rated the controls a 4.25 out of 5, citing the ease of play and the realistic motion controls. They commented that the free addition of ''Wii Sports'' with the Wii was a positive, but stated that the separate games offered less depth than regular console sports games.<ref name="GamePro"/> IGN stated,  "''Wii Sports'' is a title that demonstrates the potential of the Wii Remote, but comes up short in depth and visuals." They praised the controls, referring to them as "revolutionary", and described them as intuitive. IGN also enjoyed the ability to import Miis.<ref name="ign"/> GameTrailers called it a good complement to the Wii system and referred to all five games as a "nice total package". They commented that the games provided enough gameplay for long time gamers without making it inaccessible to novices. They stated, however, that the lack of a tournament mode was a detractor, and did not recommend paying for the game if it did not come bundled with the system.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> [[GameSpot]] complimented the multiplayer aspect and the fitness test, although they criticized the oversimplified nature of the games and commented that the motion controls were sometimes erratic.<ref name="GameSpot"/>

The separate games garnered their own reception among critics. IGN called bowling, tennis, and baseball "fun and addictive",<ref name="ign"/> while [[Eurogamer]] said baseball, golf and boxing were lacking in gameplay depth when compared with tennis and bowling.<ref name="EuroG"/> ''[[PC Magazine]]'' columnist [[John C. Dvorak]], an avid bowler, praised the realistic physics utilized in bowling and stated, "Nintendo did a stupendous job of coding." He complimented the addition of physical activity to video gaming, but complained that long term use caused his wrist and shoulder to become sore.<ref>{{cite web| author= Dvorak, John|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2098845,00.asp|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|title=Ode to the Wii| date=2007-03-06|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> IGN ranked bowling as the best experience of the five.<ref name="ign"/> GameTrailers called golf the most in-depth, but criticized the lack of multiple courses and the unpredictable controls when trying to slice or hook a shot.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> ''GamePro'' stated that golf offered the most content and was the best looking of all the games, but commented that its controls were the most difficult to use.<ref name="GamePro"/> GameTrailers called tennis the most accessible and easy to play, but criticized the difficulty of putting spin on a shot.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> IGN stated that tennis was one of the more fun games, but the lack of movement control was a detractor.<ref name="ign"/> GameTrailers called baseball the most "worthless" because of the luck factor associated with the computer-controlled fielding. They called boxing the best workout on ''Wii Sports'', but criticized the difficult timing needed to punch properly.<ref name="GameTrailers"/> IGN criticized boxing for being "like a chore" and ranked it as the worst experience of the five sports.<ref name="ign"/> Before its release, IGN commented on an [[exploit (online gaming)|exploit]] allowing easy [[Strike (bowling)|strikes]] in the bowling game that removed the challenge and replay value.<ref name="HandsOnBowling">{{cite web|url= http://wii.ign.com/articles/732/732927p1.html|title=Hands-on Wii Bowling|publisher=[[IGN]]|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=2006-09-14|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> After the release, they stated the exploit was not fixed.<ref name="IGN-Bowling"/>
