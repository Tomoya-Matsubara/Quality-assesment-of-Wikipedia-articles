'''Rhyolite''' is a [[ghost town]] in [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye County]], in the U.S. state of [[Nevada]]. It is in the [[Bullfrog Hills]], about {{convert|120|mi|km}} northwest of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], near the eastern edge of [[Death Valley]]. The town began in early 1905 as one of several mining camps that sprang up after a [[prospecting]] discovery in the surrounding hills. During an ensuing [[gold rush]], thousands of gold-seekers, developers, miners and service providers flocked to the Bullfrog Mining District. Many settled in Rhyolite, which lay in a sheltered desert basin near the region's biggest producer, the Montgomery Shoshone Mine.

Industrialist [[Charles M. Schwab]] bought the Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and invested heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town as well as the mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a [[stock exchange]]. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907<U+2013>08.

Rhyolite declined almost as rapidly as it rose. After the richest [[ore]] was exhausted, production fell. The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] and the financial [[panic of 1907]] made it more difficult to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.

After 1920, Rhyolite and its ruins became a tourist attraction and a setting for motion pictures. Most of its buildings crumbled, were salvaged for building materials, or were moved to nearby [[Beatty, Nevada|Beatty]] or other towns, although the railway depot and a house made chiefly of empty bottles were repaired and preserved. From 1988 to 1998, three companies operated a profitable [[open-pit mine]] at the base of Ladd Mountain, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of Rhyolite. The [[Goldwell Open Air Museum]] lies on private property just south of the ghost town, which is on property overseen by the [[Bureau of Land Management]].

The town is named for [[rhyolite]], an [[igneous rock]] composed of light-colored [[silicate]]s, usually [[buff (colour)|buff]] to pink and occasionally light gray.

"Bullfrog" was the name Frank "Shorty" Harris and Ernest "Ed" Cross, the prospectors who started the Bullfrog gold rush, gave to their mine. As quoted by Robert D. McCracken in ''A History of Beatty, Nevada'', Harris said during a 1930 interview for ''Westways'' magazine, "The rock was green, almost like turquoise, spotted with big chunks of yellow metal, and looked a lot like the back of a frog."<ref name="McCracken 29">McCracken, ''History'', p. 29.</ref> The Bullfrog Mining District, the Bullfrog Hills, the town of Bullfrog, and other geographical entities in the region took their name from the Bullfrog Mine.<ref>{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Helen S. | title = Nevada Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary | publisher = University of Nevada Press | year = 1974 | location = Reno, Nevada | pages = 62<U+2013>63 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=BixwbIM7ZvAC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=bullfrog+hills+name+origin#PPA62,M1 | isbn = 978-0-87417-094-8 }}</ref> [[File:Rhyolite Train Station 20061124.JPG|thumb|The town's former train station as it appeared in 2006|alt=An ornate, two-story masonry building rests under a cloudless blue sky in a setting of gravel, two spiny trees, and many low shrubs.

Beatty is named after "Old Man" Montillus (Montillion) Murray Beatty, a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran and miner who bought a ranch along the Amargosa River just north of what became the town of Beatty. In 1906, he sold the ranch to the Bullfrog Water, Power, and Light Company.<ref name="McCracken 21-22">McCracken, ''History'', pp. 21<U+2013>22.</ref> "Shoshone" in "Montgomery Shoshone Mine" refers to the [[Western Shoshone]] people indigenous to the region. In about 1875, the Shoshone had six camps along the Amargosa River near Beatty. The total population of these camps was 29, and because game was scarce, they subsisted largely on seeds, bulbs and plants gathered throughout the region, including the Bullfrog Hills.<ref name="McCracken 7-10">McCracken, ''History'', pp. 7<U+2013>10.</ref>

Nevada's main climatic features are bright sunshine, low annual precipitation, heavy snowfall in the higher mountains, clean, dry air, and large daily temperature ranges. Strong surface heating occurs by day and rapid cooling by night, and usually even the hottest days have cool nights. The average percentage of possible sunshine in southern Nevada is more than 80&nbsp;percent. Sunshine and low humidity in this region account for an average evaporation, as measured in [[Pan evaporation|evaporation pans]], of more than {{convert|100|in|mm}} of water a year.<ref name="climate">{{cite web | author = Nevada state climatologists | title = Climate of Nevada | publisher = National Climatic Data Center | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/NEVADA.htm |accessdate = February 18, 2009}}</ref>

Beatty, about {{convert|500|ft|m}} lower in elevation than Rhyolite, receives only about {{convert|6|in|mm|0}} of precipitation a year. July is the hottest month in Beatty, when the average high temperature is {{convert|97|<U+00B0>F|C|0|lk=on}} and the average low is {{convert|61|<U+00B0>F|C|0}}.

Within the district, gold rush settlements quickly arose near the mines, and Rhyolite became the largest.<ref name="Lingenfelter 210">Lingenfelter, p. 210.</ref> It sprang up near the most promising discovery, the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, which in February 1905 produced ores assayed as high as $16,000 a ton,<ref>Lingenfelter, p. 208.</ref> equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16000|1905|r=-3}}}} a ton in {{CURRENTYEAR}}.<ref name="CPI" /> Starting as a two-man camp in January 1905, Rhyolite became a town of 1,200&nbsp;people in two weeks and reached a population of 2,500 by June 1905. By then it had 50&nbsp;saloons, 35&nbsp;gambling tables, [[wikt:crib#prostitution|cribs]] for [[prostitution]], 19&nbsp;lodging houses, 16&nbsp;restaurants, half a dozen barbers, a public bath house, and a weekly newspaper, the ''Rhyolite Herald''.

Rival auto lines ferried people between Rhyolite and Goldfield and the rail station in Las Vegas in [[Pope-Toledo]]s, [[steam car|White Steamers]], and other touring cars.<ref name="Lingenfelter 210" />

[[File:Bullfrog Miner 1907.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Bullfrog Miner'', 1907]]Ernest Alexander "Bob" Montgomery, the original owner, and his partners sold the mine to industrialist [[Charles M.

By December 1907, the [[Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad]] (TTR) began service to Rhyolite on tracks leased from the BGR. The TTR was built to reach the [[borax]]-bearing [[colemanite]] beds in Death Valley as well as the gold fields.<ref name="Lingenfelter 222-224" />

The building is roofless, and large sections of it walls are missing. Masonry rubble lies about the building, which has openings for doors and windows but no glass or wood. Another ruin is nearby, and barren hills are visible in the distance.}} Rhyolite in 1907 had concrete sidewalks, electric lights, water mains, telephone and telegraph lines, daily and weekly newspapers, a monthly magazine, police and fire departments, a hospital, school, train station and railway depot, at least three banks, a [[stock exchange]], an opera house, a public swimming pool and two formal church buildings. Most prominent was the three-story John S. Cook and Co. Bank on Golden Street. Finished in 1908, it cost more than $90,000,<ref name="Lingenfelter 219">Lingenfelter, p. 219.</ref> equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|90000|1908|r=-4}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}.<ref name="CPI" /> Much of the cost went for Italian marble stairs, imported stained-glass windows, and other luxuries. The building housed [[brokerage firm|brokerage]] offices, and a post office, as well as the bank. Other large buildings included the train depot, the three-story Overbury Block, and the two-story eight-room school. A miner named Tom T. Kelly built the Bottle House in February 1906 from 50,000&nbsp;discarded beer and liquor bottles.<ref name="Lingenfelter 219" /> Another building housed the Rhyolite Mining Stock Exchange, which opened on March 25, 1907, with 125&nbsp;members, including brokers from New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and other large cities. The small, modestly equipped storefront listed shares of 74&nbsp;Bullfrog companies and a similar number of companies in nearby mining districts. Sixty thousand shares changed hands on the first day, and by the end of the second week the number had topped 750,000.<ref name="Lingenfelter 219-222">Lingenfelter, pp. 219<U+2013>22.</ref>

=== Bust ===
Although the mine produced more than $1&nbsp;million (equivalent to about $24&nbsp;million in 2009)<ref name="CPI" /> in [[Precious metal#Bullion|bullion]] in its first three years, its shares declined from $23 a share (in historical dollars) to less than $3.<ref name="Lingenfelter 237">Lingenfelter, p. 237.</ref> In February 1908, a committee of minority stockholders, suspecting that the mine was overvalued, hired a British mining engineer to conduct an inspection. The engineer's report was unfavorable, and news of this caused a sudden further decline in share value from $3 to 75&nbsp;cents.<ref name="Lingenfelter 238">Lingenfelter, p. 238.</ref> Schwab expressed disappointment when he learned that "the wonderful high-grade [ore] that had brought [the mine] fame was confined to only a few stringers and that what he had actually bought was a large low-grade mine."<ref name="Lingenfelter 237" /> Although the mine was still profitable, by 1909 no new ore was being discovered, and the value of the remaining ore steadily decreased. In 1910, the mine operated at a loss for most of the year, and on March 14, 1911, it was closed. By then, the stock, which had fallen to 10&nbsp;cents a share, slid to 4&nbsp;cents and was dropped from the exchanges.<ref name="Lingenfelter 239">Lingenfelter, p. 239.</ref>

Rhyolite began to decline before the final closing of the mine. At roughly the same time that the Bullfrog mines were running out of high-grade ore, the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service, and the financial [[panic of 1907]] restricted funding for mine development. As mines in the district reduced production or closed, unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere, businesses failed, and by 1910, the [[census]] reported only 675 residents.<ref name="Patera 57">Patera, p. 57.</ref> All three banks in the town closed by March 1910. The newspapers, including the ''Rhyolite Herald'', the last to go, all shut down by June 1912. The post office closed in November 1913; the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914, and the Nevada-California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916.<ref name="Lingenfelter 239-241">Lingenfelter, p. 241.</ref> Within a year the town was "all but abandoned",<ref name="Lingenfelter 239-241" /> and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14.<ref name="Patera 2" /> A 1922 motor tour by the ''Los Angeles Times'' found only one remaining resident, a 92-year-old man who died in 1924.<ref>McCracken, ''Frontier Oasis'', p. 27.</ref>

Much of Rhyolite's remaining infrastructure became a source of building materials for other towns and mining camps. Whole buildings were moved to Beatty. The Miners' Union Hall in Rhyolite became the Old Town Hall in Beatty, and two-room cabins were moved and reassembled as multi-room homes. Parts of many buildings were used to build a Beatty school.<ref>McCracken, ''History'', p. 40.</ref>

=== Barrick Bullfrog Mine ===
Mining in and around Rhyolite after 1920 consisted mainly of working old [[tailings]]<ref name="Hall" /> until a new mine opened in 1988 on the south side of Ladd Mountain. A company known as Bond Gold built an [[Open-pit mining|open-pit mine]] and mill at the site, about {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of Rhyolite along State Route 374. [[LAC Minerals]] acquired the mine from Bond in 1989 and established an underground mine there in 1991 after a new body of ore called the North Extension was discovered. [[Barrick Gold]] acquired LAC Minerals in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine until the end of 1998.<ref name="Hustrulid">{{cite book|last = Kump |first = Dan |coauthors = Arnold, Tim; Hustrulid, William A., ed.; Bullock, Richard L., ed. | title = Underground Mining Methods, Chapter 40, Underhand Cut-and-Fill at the Barrick Bullfrog Mine | publisher = Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration | location = Littleton, Colo. |year = 2001 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=N9Xpi6a5304C&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq=barrick+mining+rhyolite#PPA345,M1 | pages = 345<U+2013>50 | isbn = 978-0-87335-193-5 | accessdate = February 22, 2009}}</ref> The mine used a chemical extraction process known as [[Tank leaching|vat leaching]]<ref name="blm" /> involving the use of a weak [[cyanide]] solution. The process, like [[heap leaching]], makes it possible to process ore profitably that otherwise would not qualify as mill-grade. Over its entire life, the mine processed about {{convert|2800000|ST|t|-5|lk=on}} of ore and produced about {{convert|690000|oz|kg|-3|lk=on}} of gold.<ref name="Hustrulid" />
