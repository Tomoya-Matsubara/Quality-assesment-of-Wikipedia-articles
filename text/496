'''Lludd Llaw Eraint''', "Lludd of the Silver Hand", son of [[Beli Mawr]], is a legendary hero from [[Welsh mythology]]. As '''Nudd Llaw Eraint''' (the earlier form of his name, [[cognate]] of  the [[Irish mythology|Irish]] [[Nuada]] Airgetl<U+00E1>m, derived from the pre-Roman [[Prehistoric Britain|British]] god [[Nodens]]) he is the father of [[Gwyn ap Nudd]]. He is probably the source of king [[Lud son of Heli|Lud]] from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s [[History of the Kings of Britain]].

In the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' tale of ''[[Lludd and Llefelys]]'', which seems heavily influenced by Geoffrey of Monmouth's work, he is the ruler of [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]] while his brother [[Llefelys]] ruled [[Gaul]]. Lludd calls on Llefelys to rid Britain of three plagues then afflicting the kingdom. According to legend, there was once a temple to Lludd at the site of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[London]], near [[Ludgate]], which is named after him.

==The plagues of Lludd<U+2019>s reign==
*The first plague was that of the [[Coranian]]s. 
*The second was that of the [[White Dragon|white]] and [[Y Ddraig Goch|red dragons]]. One of the dragons represented the [[Brython]]s, while the other represented the [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders of Britain. On the eve of [[Beltaine|May Day]], the two dragons would begin to fight. The [[White Dragon]] would strive to overcome the [[Y Ddraig Goch|Red Dragon]], making the Red cry out a fearful shriek which was heard over every Brythonic hearth. This shriek went through people<U+2019>s hearts, scaring them so much that the men lost their hue and their strength, women lost their children, young men and the maidens lost their senses, and all the animals and trees and the earth and the waters, were left barren. The plague was finally eradicated by catching the dragons and burying both of them in a rock pit at [[Dinas Emrys]] in [[Snowdonia]], north [[Wales]], the securest place in Britain at that time. The dragons were caught by digging out a pit under the exact point where the dragons would fall down exhausted after fighting. This place was at [[Oxford]], which [[Lludd]] found to be the exact centre of the island when he measured the island of [[Prydain|Britain]]. The pit had a satin covering over it and a cauldron of mead in it at the bottom. First, the dragons fought by the pit in the form of terrific animals. Then they began to fight in the air over the pit in the form of dragons. Then exhausted with the fighting, they fell down on the pit in the form of pigs and sank into the pit drawing the satin covering under them into the cauldron at the bottom of the pit whereupon they drank the mead and fell asleep. The dragons were then wrapped up in the satin covering and placed in the pit to be buried at Dinas Emrys. 
*The third plague was the plunder committed by a giant who wore strong, heavy armour and carried a hamper. His nocturnal entrance was heralded by soporific illusions and musical sounds which lulled the members of Lludd<U+2019>s Court to sleep. Once the court was asleep, he would put all the food and provisions of meat and drink of Lludd<U+2019>s Court into his commodious hamper and take it away with him. This recurring theft constituted the third plague of Lludd<U+2019>s reign. Lludd was only able to stop the recurring theft by confronting the intruder. He was able to avoid falling asleep to the soporific illusions and musical sounds by frequently dipping his head in a vessel of cold water by his side. Upon confronting the magician, a fierce encounter ensued in which glittering fire flew out from their arms until Lludd overcame the magician. Thereupon, Lludd granted him mercy and made him his loyal vassal.

==Etymology==
The name ''Nudd'', [[cognate]] with the Irish ''[[Nuada]]'' and related to the [[Romano-British]] ''[[Nodens]]'', probably derives from a [[Proto-Celtic|Celtic]] [[word stem|stem]] *''noudont-''  or ''*noudent-'', which [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] suggested was related to a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root meaning "acquire, have the use of", earlier "to catch, entrap (as a hunter)". Making the connection with Nuada and Lludd's hand, he detected "an echo of the ancient fame of the magic hand of Nodens the Catcher".<ref>[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], "The Name Nodens", Appendix to "Report on the excavation of the prehistoric, Roman and post-Roman site in [[Lydney Park]], Gloucestershire", ''Reports of the Research Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of London'', 1932</ref> Similarly, [[Julius Pokorny]] derives the name from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*neu-d-'' meaning "acquire, utilise, go fishing".<ref>[[Julius Pokorny]], ''[[Indogermanisches etymologisches W<U+00F6>rterbuch]]'' 768</ref>
