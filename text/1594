The [[British Rail]] '''Class 43''' is the classification used for production [[High Speed Train]] power cars. They were built by [[BREL]] from [[1976]] to [[1982]].

== History ==

When built, the production [[High Speed Train]] (HST) units were considered to be [[diesel-electric multiple unit]]s, and were allocated Classes [[British Rail Class 253|253 and 254]] for Western and Eastern Region services respectively. The power cars (of [[UIC classification|Bo-Bo]] [[wheel arrangement]]) were numbered 43002-43198 in the carriage number series. 43001 was applied to one of the two prototype power cars, while the first of the pair, now preserved, became 43000, an unusual number as no other loco carried a triple-0 number.

In the [[1980s]], following problems with the power cars, unit formations were abandoned and from then on HSTs were considered to be formed of two locomotives with a rake of semi-permanently formed carriages in between. The power cars were not renumbered, but merely considered henceforth to be Class 43 locomotives.

The HST was the staple rolling stock on the [[East Coast Main Line]] from the retirement of the renowned [[British Rail Class 55|Deltic]] locomotives in 1980-82 to the introduction of the [[Intercity 225]] following electrification in 1990. Several HST power cars were fitted with buffers at the nose ends to assist with the changeover to the 225, enabling them to tow the newer trains during testing and in non-electrified areas. This gives a more squat appearance than other power cars.

The class are officially the fastest diesels in the world with an absolute maximum of 148mph, and 125mph regular service speed. In [[2004]], 196 Class 43 locomotives were operated by four private companies (Midland Mainline, Great North Eastern Railway, Virgin  and First Great Western). By late [[2005]] this had dropped to 195 after 43019 was written off following the [[Ufton Nervet rail crash]]. Following withdrawal by Virgin in 2003 several power cars are now in store, locations including [[Minehead]] at the western end of the [[West Somerset Railway]].

==Life Extension of HSTs==
The Class 43, having been operation since the late 1970s, is due for replacement by <U+2018>HST 2<U+2019>.  The development cycle for the replacement series is such that the existing fleet may be required to operate through to 2015 or beyond.
In support of this a life extension program is being considered.  Such a programme will require ROSCOs and TOCs to address a number of issues within the power cars.

During [[2005]] two Class 43 locomotives (43004 and 43009) operated by [[First Great Western]] were fitted with new MTU 16V 4000 engines. These two vehicles are currently being tested in passenger use on the [[Great Western Main Line]]. They can be identified by their modified headlight clusters, the quietness of the engine and the new Neon Livery.

Also within [[First Great Western]] two power cars (43170 and 43179) have been installed with updated 12VP185L engines.

Both upated engines offer improvements over the existing [[Paxman (engines)|Paxman]] [[Paxman Valenta|12RP200 'Valenta']] engines, with reduced smoke and exhaust emissions.

[[GNER]] has obligations following its re-franchise to replace engines within its HST fleet, and is currently thought to be pursuing the VP185 engine option. However the MTU-engine is also being considered given the trials being conducted by [[First Great Western]]. First Great Western is particularly comparing the performance of the MTU-engined units with modified VP185 units.

In December 2005 First announced that all Great Western power cars will receive the MTU engine. The first batch were sent to Brush Traction for the installation of the new engines.

== In fiction ==

In [[the Railway Series]], there are two diesels who had the same type as the Class 43 (HST). They were [[Pip & Emma]].
