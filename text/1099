Since 1976 Peter Bernus worked internationally on various aspects of enterprise integration as researcher, consultant and project leader for Industry, Government and Defence. In 2000-2003 Bernus was the Australian leader of the [[Enterprise Engineering]] work package of the Globemen International consortium, working with over 20 companies, that include ERP vendors, shipbuilding and engineering companies, among others.<ref name="Bio"> [http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~bernus/cv.html Short bio]. Accessed 10 Jan 2009</ref>He is currently an Associate Professor at [[Griffith University]] teaching in the Masters of Enterprise Architecture program. 

Bernus is the past chair of the IFIP-IFAC Task Force for Architectures for [[Enterprise Integration]] which developed [[GERAM]], the Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology (ISO 15704:2000) and foundation chair of Working Group 5.12 on Enterprise Integration of the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP), currently working on the harmonisation of EA Frameworks, systems engineering and software engineering standards.<ref name="Bio"/>

Peter Bernus research interests are in [[Enterprise Modelling]], [[Enterprise Integration]] and 
Architectures for Enterprise Integration.<ref name="IFAC08"/>Special interests include inter- and intra-organisational management, global enterprise networks, and dynamic project enterprises. He also has special interest in computer-mediated communication between people and ways to achieve common understanding.<ref name="Bio"/>

=== GERAM Enterprise Architecture Framework ===
Starting from the evaluation of existing enterprise integration architectures, such as [[CIMOSA]], [[GRAI/GIM]] and [[PERA]], the [[IFAC]]/[[IFIP]] Task Force on Architectures for Enterprise Integration has developed an overall definition of a generalised architecture. The proposed framework was entitled [[GERAM]] for Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology. GERAM is about those methods, models and tools which are needed to build and maintain the integrated enterprise, be it a part of an enterprise, a single enterprise or a network of enterprises virtual enterprise or extended enterprise.<ref>[http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~bernus/taskforce/geram/versions/geram1-6-3/v1.6.3.html Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology]. Version 1.6.3 (March 1999). Accessed 10 Jan 2009.</ref>

=== Handbook on Enterprise Architecture ===
The 2003 "Handbook on Enterprise Architecture" edited with Laszlo Nemes and G<U+00FC>nter Schmidt covers methods and tools necessary to define or redefine enterprises of all kind, as well as to structure the implementation into manageable projects. This book was born from the marriage of management science with engineering in its broadest sense. [[Enterprise integration]] aims at establishing healthy, dynamic enterprises which serve their customers and stakeholders in the best possible way.<ref>[http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~bernus/hei/index.html Handbook on Enterprise Architecture] Accessed 10 Jan 2009.</ref>

This handbook is about methods, tools and examples of how to architect an enterprise through considering all life cycle aspects of Enterprise Entities, such as individual enterprises, enterprise networks, virtual enterprises, projects and other complex systems including a mixture of automated and human processes. The book is based on the [[GERAM]] Framework, that generalises the requirements of Enterprise Reference Architectures. Various Architecture Frameworks such as PERA, CIMOSA, Grai-GIM, Zachman, C4ISR/DoDAF are shown in light of GERAM to allow a deeper understanding of their contributions and therefore their correct and knowledgeable use.<ref>Peter Bernus, Laszlo Nemes and G<U+00FC>nter Schmidt (ed.)

Bernus has published over sixty refereed papers and book chapters, several edited books.<ref>[http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bernus:Peter.html Peter Bernus] List of publications from the DBLP Bibliography Server. Accessed 10 Jan 2009.</ref>
