The '''Vietnam Meritorious Service Medal''' was a military decoration of [[South Vietnam]] that was issued between the years of [[1950]] and [[1974]].  Each of the three Vietnamese military services issued its own version of the Meritorious Service Medal.

The medal was intended to recognize significant military achievement, both in combat and non-combat service, which surpassed the degree required for the [[Vietnam Gallantry Cross]] but did not warrant receipt of the higher decorations such as the [[National Order of Vietnam]] or the [[Vietnam Military Merit Medal]].

The Vietnam Meritorious Service Medal was occasionally bestowed to foreign militaries, with several [[United States military]] members receiving the decoration during the years of the [[Vietnam War]].  The decoration became obsolete with the fall of South Vietnam in 1975, and is today only available for purchase through private dealers of military insignia.
