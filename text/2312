'''Wappocomo''' is a late 18th century [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] mansion and associated [[farm]] overlooking the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]] north of [[Romney, West Virginia|Romney]] in the U.S. state of [[West Virginia]]. Wappocomo is located along Cumberland Road ([[West Virginia Route 28]]) and the [[South Branch Valley Railroad]]. 

The original section of the mansion at Wappocomo was built in 1774 by Nicholas Casey (1745<U+2013>1833), using bricks that had been used as [[ballast]] to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the [[James River]]. The Wappocomo property had been a part of the "South Branch Survey" of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]'s [[Northern Neck Proprietary]]. The Parsons family, prominent in [[Virginia]] and West Virginia politics in the 18th and 19th centuries, acquired Wappocomo and continue to maintain ownership of the property into the 21st century.

Wappocomo was involved in two slavery-related disputes that caused friction between the governments of [[Pennsylvania]] and Virginia. In 1788, Nicholas Casey purchased a freed slave by the name of John, who had been kidnapped in Pennsylvania and returned into slavery in Virginia. [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Thomas Mifflin]] demanded that the [[Governor of Virginia]] punish the three Virginia residents responsible for the abduction and re-enslavement of a [[freedman]], however, Virginia's governor cited the absence of such a clause in the [[United States Constitution]]. In August 1855, a [[fugitive slave]] named Jacob Green escaped from Wappocomo with several other slaves to Pennsylvania. Col. [[Isaac Parsons (American military officer)|Isaac Parsons]] (1814<U+2013>62) and his nephews went north to pursue the escapees, resulting in the arrest of his nephew, James "Zip" Parsons III (1831<U+2013>93). Parsons' trial caused a further dispute between the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania over the latter's refusal to execute the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].

The mansion at Wappocomo is unique among the historic residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that its formal [[facade|fa<U+00E7>ade]] faces toward the road and the western flanks of [[South Branch Mountain]] rather than toward the river. The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in [[England]], and used as [[ballast]] to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the [[James River]]. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking. A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep [[veranda]]s was completed in 1861. The principal [[Train station|passenger depot]] for the [[Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad]], Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.

===Background and construction===
[[File:ThomasFairfax6th.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]]]
The land on which Wappocomo is located was originally part of the "South Branch Survey" of [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]'s [[Northern Neck Proprietary]].<ref name = "Zimmerman1">{{Harvnb|Zimmerman|2012|p=8.}}</ref><ref name = "Brannon8">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=286.}}</ref> The "South Branch Survey" extended from the north end of [[The Trough]] to the confluence of the [[Potomac River#North Branch Potomac River|North]] and [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branches]] of the [[Potomac River]].<ref name = "Brannon8"/> Lord Fairfax originally planned to maintain the "South Branch Survey" as his personal [[manor]], but later commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale in 1748, with land lots ranging in size from {{convert|300|acre}} to {{convert|400|acre}}.<ref name = "Zimmerman1"/><ref name = "Brannon8"/>

Prominent [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]] pioneer Peter Casey (1715<U+2013>87) received the Wappocomo parcel known as Lot Number 21 of the "South Branch Survey" from Lord Fairfax.<ref name = "Zimmerman2">{{Harvnb|Zimmerman|2012|p=9.}}</ref> Casey's son, Nicholas Casey (1745<U+2013>1833), married Grace Foreman (1762<U+2013>1796), the daughter of another Hampshire County pioneer and colonial military officer [[William Foreman]].<ref name = "Munske1">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=152.}}</ref> Nicholas Casey inherited Lot Number 21 from his father, and in 1774, Casey built the present mansion at Wappocomo.<ref name = "Zimmerman2"/><ref name = "Brannon1">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=313.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell4">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=722.}}</ref>

The bricks used in the construction of Casey's mansion were manufactured in [[England]], and used as [[ballast]] to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the [[James River]].<ref name = "Brannon1"/> These bricks were then transported overland through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]] in [[bullock cart]]s.<ref name = "Brannon1"/> During this time, the mansion was named Wappocomo, which was derived from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Toponymy|toponym]] "Wappatomaka" for the South Branch Potomac River.<ref name = "Brannon1"/>

In 1788, while residing at his Wappocomo residence, Casey purchased a freed slave named John, who had been residing in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name = "Finkelman1">{{Harvnb|Finkelman|2012|p=191.}}</ref><ref name = "Palmer1">{{Harvnb|Palmer|McRae|1885|p=321.}}</ref> Virginia residents Francis McGuire, Baldwin Parsons, and Absalom Wells seized John and transported him to Virginia, where they sold him back into slavery to Casey.<ref name = "Finkelman1"/><ref name = "Palmer1"/> Such an act was illegal in Pennsylvania, and the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]] petitioned [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Thomas Mifflin]] to demand for punishment of the three men by the [[Governor of Virginia]].<ref name = "Finkelman1"/><ref name = "Palmer1"/> Virginia's governor refused, citing the absence of such a provision calling for such action in the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name = "Finkelman1"/><ref name = "Palmer1"/> Governor Mifflin petitioned the [[United States Congress]], and a bill was introduced that provided against such an occurrence.<ref name = "Finkelman1"/>

On December 4, 1789, Casey was appointed by an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] as a trustee of Romney.<ref name = "Lewis1">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1892|p=44.}}</ref><ref name = "Lewis2">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1889|p=487.}}</ref><ref name = "FWP1">{{Harvnb|Federal Writers' Project|1937|p=58.}}</ref> Casey served as a trustee alongside [[Isaac Parsons (Virginia politician)|Isaac Parsons]] and [[Andrew Wodrow]].<ref name = "Lewis1"/><ref name = "Lewis2"/><ref name = "FWP1"/> Casey and his fellow trustees were given authority by the Virginia General Assembly to settle disputes regarding the town's [[land lot]]s and to "open and clear" the town's "streets and lanes" in accordance with the original survey and plan for Romney.<ref name = "FWP1"/>

=== Parsons family acquisition ===
Nicholas Casey's daughter, Mary Catherine Casey (1773<U+2013>1846), married James Gregg Parsons (1773<U+2013>1847) of Hampshire County in 1795.<ref name = "Zimmerman2"/><ref name = "MacCabe1">{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=254.}}</ref> Parsons was the eldest son of Isaac Parsons (1752<U+2013>1796) and his wife Mary Ellender Gregg.<ref name = "MacCabe1"/> The Parsons were a prominent family whose ancestors arrived to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] from England in 1635, and relocated to Hampshire County around 1740.<ref name = "Zimmerman2"/><ref name = "Munske4">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=45.}}</ref> Isaac Parsons represented Hampshire County as a member of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] from 1789 until his death on August 25, 1796.<ref name = "Munske4"/> By 1778, Parsons owned {{convert|161|acre}} of Lot Number 16 and all of Lot Number 17, which was adjacent to the Wappocomo property.<ref name = "Munske5">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=144.}}</ref>

James Gregg Parsons and his wife Catherine inherited Wappocomo from her father, and they raised their 12 children there.<ref name = "Zimmerman2"/> Following his wife's death, Parsons acquired sole ownership in Wappocomo plantation.<ref name = "MacCabe2">{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=255.}}</ref> After his death on January 25, 1847, his will, dated November 7, 1846 and probated February 22, 1847, devised Lot Number 21 including Wappocomo (referred to in the will as the "Casey tract") to his son Colonel [[Isaac Parsons (American military officer)|Isaac Parsons]] (1814<U+2013>62).<ref name = "Zimmerman2"/><ref name = "MacCabe2"/> On May 18, 1836, Col.

=== Jacob Green affair ===
[[File:Charles J. Faulkner 1806-1884 - Brady-Handy.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]]]]
In August 1855, Jacob Green, a slave owned by Col. Parsons, escaped from Wappocomo farm with four other slaves from neighboring plantations.<ref name = "HH2">{{Citation | url = http://www.historichampshire.org/black/JGreen.htm | title = Jacob Green, Runaway Slave: The Pursuit of Jacob Green by the Parsons Family and the Problem of Free States | work = Historic Hampshire County, West Virginia: West Virginia's Oldest County | publisher = Charles C.

Parsons' plantation in Romney, and persuaded four or five slaves from neighboring farms owned by Parsons family relatives to escape with him to Pennsylvania.<ref name = "HH2"/><ref name = "NPS1"/>

A party of eight to ten men, including Col. Parsons and two of his nephews, James "Zip" Parsons III (1831<U+2013>93) and a Mr. Stump, went north in pursuit of the escapees. In the course of the pursuit, they captured two of Stump's escaped slaves, who were sent back to Hampshire County.<ref name = "HH2"/><ref name = "NPS1"/>  With information obtained from the two recaptured slaves, Col. Parsons went to [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], James Parsons III to [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania|Hollidaysburg]], and Stump to [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]], where they hoped to intercept Green as he headed west on the [[Allegheny Portage Railroad]] and [[Main Line of Public Works|Main Line Canal]] toward [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name = "NPS1"/> James Parsons III intercepted Green at Hollidaysburg, but local [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] thwarted his attempt to capture Green, and Parsons was arrested and arraigned for kidnapping.<ref name = "HH2"/><ref name = "NPS1"/>

Upon learning of the arrest of his nephew, Col. Parsons sought the assistance of [[Charles J. Faulkner|Charles James Faulkner]], a prominent [[Martinsburg, West Virginia|Martinsburg]] lawyer and [[United States House of Representatives|United States House Representative]] from [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], and of [[James Murray Mason]], a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from Virginia.<ref name = "HH2"/> Faulkner and Mason both offered their legal services for James Parsons III's defense.<ref name = "HH2"/> The [[Virginia General Assembly]] pledged its support to Parsons and to Virginia's slaveowners in defending their constitutional rights and to protect them from prosecution.<ref name = "HH2"/><ref name = "VHD1">{{Harvnb|Virginia House of Delegates|1856|p=246.}}</ref> [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Henry A.

Col. Parsons, Faulkner, and Tucker traveled to Hollidaysburg for James Parsons III's trial.<ref name = "HH2"/> Faulkner provided for Parsons' legal defense, leading to his acquittal as having acted legally under the provisions of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].<ref name="NPS1"/>

In September 1856, Faulkner billed Col. Parsons $150 for his legal services.  Parsons disputed the charge.  In a series of articles in the ''[[Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser]]'', he declared that Faulkner had originally offered his services at no cost; that he had been lauded publicly for his generosity in doing so without ever denying that he had been working ''[[pro bono]]''; and that he was practicing "duplicity and deception" in trying to win a reputation in his district through "specious acts of munificence".<ref name = "HH2"/>

Faulkner later served as [[United States Ambassador to France|United States Minister to France]]; following the American Civil War, he again served as a member of the United States House of Representatives, from [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district]]. James Parsons III and his brother William Miller Parsons (born 1835) were later proprietors of the ''Virginia Argus''.<ref name = "MacCabe5">{{Harvnb|MacCabe|1913|p=260.}}</ref><ref name = "Maxwell1">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=357.}}</ref><ref name = "LOC1">{{Citation | url = http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84037876/ | title = About Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, 1850-1861. | work = [[Chronicling America]] | publisher = [[Library of Congress]], [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] | oclc=11111337 | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}</ref>

Following its construction by Col. Parsons in 1861, the [[ballroom]] in the upper story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since its construction in 1861. It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion for the first time to write their names and the date of their visit on the [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still legible.<ref name = "Brannon5">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=315.}}</ref>

=== American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Col. Parsons received permission to raise an independent [[Company (military unit)|company]] of [[mounted infantry]] to provide defense along the border.<ref name = "Blue2">{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=4.}}</ref> He set about enrolling volunteers and, within a short period of time, enlisted approximately 30 men.<ref name = "Blue2"/> Following its organization, the company became known as the Huckleberry Rangers of the [[Confederate States Army]]'s [[13th Virginia Infantry|13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].<ref name = "Munske2">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|p=162.}}</ref> Parsons traveled to Richmond with a supply of cattle, and returned to his company's camp on the [[North River (Cacapon River)|North River]] in Hampshire County around November 15, 1861.<ref name = "Blue4">{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=29.}}</ref> Throughout 1861, Col. Parsons "gratuitously" provided Confederate soldiers with food at his table and horses from his stables at his Wappocomo plantation.<ref name = "Blue4"/>

Parsons was anxious to learn about the condition of his family and property at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket.<ref name = "Blue4"/> Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the [[Northwestern Turnpike]] to around [[Pleasant Dale, West Virginia|Pleasant Dale]], then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney.<ref name = "Blue4"/> Parsons stayed behind in the hollow, while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes.<ref name = "Blue4"/> Knowing that the [[Union Army]] kept a 24-hour guard at the main house,<ref name = "Blue4"/> Blue circled around to the rear of the mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family.<ref name = "Blue5">{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=30.}}</ref> Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt.

Lt. Blue and Parrish returned to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating [[pine]] from which to make torches to light their way out of the hollow.<ref name = "Blue6">{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=31.}}</ref> Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch.<ref name = "Blue6"/> He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding.<ref name = "Blue6"/> The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire.<ref name = "Blue7">{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=32.}}</ref> The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish.<ref name = "Blue7"/> Parsons and Blue continued east over [[Town Hill]] and reached George Thompson's residence on the [[Little Cacapon River]], which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall.<ref name = "Blue7"/> They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to [[Hanging Rock, West Virginia|Blue's Gap]], where they set up camp.<ref name = "Blue7"/> There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. [[Angus William McDonald]] to carry out an expedition for General [[Stonewall Jackson]] to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney;<ref name = "Blue7"/> he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.<ref name = "Blue8">{{Harvnb|Blue|1994|p=33.}}</ref>

=== Post-war ownership ===
Col. Parsons died on 24 April 1862, while the American Civil War was still in progress.<ref name = "Brannon5"/> On April 26, 1862, acting [[Quartermaster]] Lt. F. H. Morse of the [[Union Army]] completed his death certificate, in which he noted Parsons' "very fine house near Romney."<ref name = "FHS1">{{Harvnb|Firelands Historical Society|1907|pp=1380<U+2013>1381.}}</ref> Following his death, the plantation was inherited by Col.

Its principal depot is Wappocomo Station, located on the Wappocomo farm; the station consists of a ticket office housed in a red 1940 [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] [[caboose]], numbered C2507; the caboose is owned by the Chesapeake and Ohio Historical Society and leased by the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad.<ref name = "PE1">{{Citation | url = http://www.potomaceagle.info/location.php | title = Location of the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad: The Caboose Station at Romney | work = Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad website | publisher = Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "PE2">{{Citation | url = http://www.potomaceagle.info/history.php | title = History of the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad | work = Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad website | publisher = Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "Munske3">{{Harvnb|Munske|Kerns|2004|pp=125<U+2013>126.}}</ref>

Part of Wappocomo's original land tract, located near the city limits of Romney, was sold for residential building lots and for the Fruit Growers Storage facility, a refrigerated storage plant for fruit stands along the South Branch Valley Railroad near the mansion.<ref name = "Brannon6">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|pp=315<U+2013>316.}}</ref><ref name = "Brannon10">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=20.}}</ref> The Fruit Growers Storage facility also provided refrigerated storage for fruit that was to be shipped as freight on the South Branch Valley Railroad.<ref name = "Brannon10"/>

Charles Heber Parsons, Jr.'s son, Charles "Chuck" Heber Parsons III (1955<U+2013>2012), inherited the farm at Wappocomo and carefully restored and maintained the property.

== Architecture ==

===Exterior===
The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style structure with a basement and attic, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia at the time of Wappocomo's construction.<ref name = "Brannon1"/> This part of the mansion is built of large weighted ballast bricks, with walls that measure {{convert|1|ft|6|in|m}} in depth, allowing for deep inset windows.<ref name = "Brannon1"/> It also features two inside chimneys on either side, which once stood higher above its steep roof.<ref name = "Brannon3">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|p=314.}}</ref> The mansion's formal entrance is covered by a small [[portico]] supported with wooden columns and [[engaged column]]s at the wall.<ref name = "Brannon5"/>

Other historic homes located along the South Branch Potomac River face the river; the mansion at Wappocomo is unique in that its formal [[facade|fa<U+00E7>ade]] faces toward Cumberland Road ([[West Virginia Route 28]]) and the western flanks of [[South Branch Mountain]]. This may be due in part to the house's distance from the river, approximately {{convert|0.5|mi}}. The house's second-floor rear windows offer a scenic view of the South Branch Potomac River.<ref name = "Brannon5"/>

===Interior===
The home's wooden [[sill plate]]s and [[joists]] were sawed by hand and the "rot nails" used for their construction were manufactured in the blacksmith shop on the Wappocomo plantation.<ref name = "Brannon2">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|pp=313<U+2013>314.}}</ref> The residence at Wappocomo also features unusually high fireplace mantelpieces, wide grooved window [[Molding (decorative)|moldings]] and casings with base panels, solid paneled doors, and interior woodworking throughout, all of which were handmade.<ref name = "Brannon3"/> Every room of the main structure originally contained a corner fireplace.<ref name = "Brannon3"/>

Both of the mansion's two floors consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, and each of these rooms is exactly the same size and shape.<ref name = "Brannon4">{{Harvnb|Brannon|1976|pp=314<U+2013>315.}}</ref> A grand stairway is located at the end of the mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic.<ref name = "Brannon5"/> The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a [[baluster|balustrade]] consisting of three small balusters per step.<ref name = "Brannon5"/>

The basement rooms at Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground. The house's foundation is constructed of large stone blocks, into which was crafted a large open fireplace that once exhibited a swinging iron [[chimney crane]]. The space around this large open fireplace within the mansion's basement formerly served as a kitchen, where most of the cooking and food preparation took place. Entry into the home's basement is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door.<ref name = "Brannon3"/>

=== Stone addition ===
[[File:South Branch Potomac River Romney WV 2008 06 22.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Mill Creek Mountain]] viewed from the [[Potomac River#South Branch Potomac River|South Branch Potomac River]].]]
In 1861, a stone addition to the original 1774 Georgian structure was built. The large stone blocks used for the construction of the addition were quarried from the plantation's [[Mill Creek Mountain]], a ridge located across the South Branch Potomac River to the west of the mansion. The stone blocks were hewed by sawyers, then transported across the river to the mansion, and lifted upon the addition's scaffolding with wheelbarrows. A Mr. Ferrybe supervised and managed the stone addition's construction.<ref name = "Brannon5"/>

The 1861 stone addition's two floors consisted of two large rooms on each floor, with {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} ceilings. The two upstairs rooms were transformed into a large [[ballroom]], while the two downstairs rooms were used as a dining room and kitchen.<ref name = "Brannon5"/>

The stone addition exhibits two stories of deep [[veranda]]s extending across its eastern front fa<U+00E7>ade. These verandas were once supported by tall columns rising from the addition's ground-level porch, to the roof of the second-story porch. An exterior stairway once connected the lower porch to the upper porch.<ref name = "Brannon5"/>

[[File:Hanging Rocks Wappocomo WV 2005 09 21 03.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Hanging Rocks]]]]
Wappocomo farm is located within the relatively flat [[floodplain]] of the South Branch Potomac River valley, to the north of Romney. The farm's property adjoins the Valley View farm and Romney [[City limits|corporate limits]] to the southwest, the South Branch Potomac River to the west and north, and the South Branch Valley Railroad line and Cumberland Road (West Virginia Route 28) to the east. Mill Creek Mountain, a narrow [[anticline|anticlinal]] mountain ridge, rises to the west of the opposite [[Bank (geography)|riverbank]] of the South Branch Potomac River, and the western foothills of South Branch Mountain rise to the east.<ref name=GNIS1>{{cite web |url={{Gnis3|1543330}} |title=Geographic Names Information System: Feature Detail Report for Mill Creek Mountain (Feature ID: 1543330) |author=[[Geographic Names Information System]], [[United States Geological Survey]] |authorlink= |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name=GNIS2>{{cite web |url={{Gnis3|1552967}} |title=Geographic Names Information System: Feature Detail Report for South Branch Mountain (Feature ID: 1552967) |author=[[Geographic Names Information System]], [[United States Geological Survey]] |authorlink= |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref> Mill Creek and South Branch Mountains contain [[Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests]] of [[hardwood]]s and [[pine]].<ref name = "WVDNR1">{{Citation | url = http://www.wvdnr.gov/Hunting/D2WMAareas.shtm | title = District 2 Wildlife Management Areas | work = West Virginia Division of Natural Resources Wildlife Resources Section website | publisher = [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources]] Wildlife Resources Section | accessdate = December 10, 2013}}</ref> [[Hanging Rocks]], cliffs of [[Stratum|stratified]] [[Ridgeley sandstone|Oriskany]] [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]] layers, are located within a gap where the South Branch Potomac River cuts through Mill Creek Mountain approximately {{convert|3|mi}} north of Wappocomo farm.<ref name = "Chamberlin1">{{Harvnb|Chamberlin|1915|p=16.}}</ref> The [[unincorporated area]] at Hanging Rocks is known similarly as [[Wappocomo, West Virginia|Wapocomo]] (or Wappocomo).<ref name=GNIS3>{{cite web |url={{Gnis3|1549977}} |title=Geographic Names Information System: Feature Detail Report for Wapocomo (Feature ID: 1549977) |author=[[Geographic Names Information System]], [[United States Geological Survey]] |authorlink= |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "HH3">{{Harvnb|McMaster|2010|p=47.}}</ref>

Big Run, a [[tributary]] [[stream]] of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property, bordered by dense foliage.<ref name=GNIS4>{{cite web |url={{Gnis3|1535949}} |title=Geographic Names Information System: Feature Detail Report for Big Run (Feature ID: 1535949) |author=[[Geographic Names Information System]], [[United States Geological Survey]] |authorlink= |accessdate=December 10, 2013}}</ref> Shortly before it enters Wappocomo farm, Big Run flows alongside ledges of gray [[shale]] known to contain ''[[Chonetes]]'' and ''[[Sinotectirostrum|Camarotoechia]]'' [[fossil]]s.<ref name = "Chamberlin2">{{Harvnb|Chamberlin|1915|p=13.}}</ref> A smaller unnamed stream flows through the front lawn of the house at Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. [[Maize|Corn]] is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich [[Alluvium|alluvial soils]].

=== Washington Place ===
[[File:Washington Place Romney WV 2005 9 21 05.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Washington Place]]]]
On November 7, 1874, Col. Parsons' widow, Susan Blue Parsons, conveyed {{convert|2|acre}} of Wappocomo's land to [[freedman]] William Washington, his wife Ann, and their children. Washington had previously worked on [[Washington Bottom Farm]], from which he took the surname of his owner, George William Washington. This deed enabled the Washington family to reside on that land lot as long as any of the individuals specified in the deed lived there. On September 17, 1892, Garrett Williams Parsons and his wife, Mary Avery Covell Parsons, conveyed to Washington an additional {{convert|3|acre}} of land. The old log house built by Washington on this former Wappocomo land lot is presently known as [[Washington Place (West Virginia)|Washington Place]], and it is thought to be one of the first residences built by freed slaves in Hampshire County.<ref name = "Munske2"/>
