The '''Pomeranian''' (often known as a '''Pom''') is a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]] of the [[Spitz]] type, named for the [[Pomerania]] region in [[Central Europe]] (today part of eastern [[Germany]] and northern [[Poland]]). Classed as a [[toy dog]] breed because of its small size, the pomerianian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Cynologique Internationale]] to be part of the [[German Spitz]] breed, and in many countries, they are known as the '''Zwergspitz''' (''Dwarf Spitz''), or '''Toy German Spitz'''.

The breed was made popular by a number of royal owners during the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Queen Victoria]] owned a particularly  small Pomeranian at the time, and consequently the smaller variety become universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by 50%. Pomeranians respond well to firm, consistent obedience training, but otherwise will do what they please.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lowell| first = Michelle| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Your Purebred Puppy: A Buyers Guide| publisher = Henry Holt| date = 1990| location =  New York, NY| pages = | isbn = 0-8050-1411-X}}</ref> They are known to bark defensively in response to any outside noise. Overall the pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. [[Luxating patellas]] is the most common health issue, although there is also another condition unique to the breed sometimes called black skin disease. The breed is currently among the top 15 most popular in the USA, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.

The earliest Poms were white or occasionally black, however [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webanswers.com/pets/what-is-a-pomeranian-8a12b7|title=What is a pomeranian| work=Web Answers| accessdate=2010-02-02}}</ref> In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, plus combinations of those colors.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pomeranians for Dummies |last=Coile |first=D.

The [[Merle (coat colour in dogs)|merle]] pomeranian is a recent color developed by breeders. It is a combination of a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad colors are different in merles, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.<ref name="merle">{{cite web |url=http://www.merlepomeranian.com/ |title=Merle Pomeranians |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Merle Pomeranians |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>
[[image:PomPhoto10.jpg|thumb|right|A parti-colored Pomeranian]]

Pomeranians have a thick double coat, and while grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it is done daily because of the thickness of the coat and the constant shedding. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.happypomeranians.com/pomeranian-dogs/tips-on-pomeranian-grooming |title=Tips on Pomeranian Grooming |author=Dane Stanton |date=2009 |work=Pomeranian Dogs |access date=2010-02-02}}</ref>

=== Behavior ===
Pomeranians are typically very friendly and lively. This breed of dog loves to be around their owners and can be protective of them.<ref name="dogster">{{cite web |url=http://www.dogster.com/breeds/pomeranian |title=Pomeranian Dogs |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Dogster.com |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref> They bond quickly with their owners, and can suffer from separation anxiety if not trained to spend time alone.<Ref name="pets4you"/> Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment and barking at new stimuli can develop into the habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and will bark at any outside noise.<Ref name="pets4you"/> Pomeranians are intelligent dogs and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. Their intelligence, however, means that they respond well to training.<ref name="dogster"/>

They tend to seek out cooler environments, and it is common to find one lying down on a cold floor.<Ref name="pets4you">{{cite web |url=http://www.pets4you.com/dog_breed_description/pomeranian/ |title=Pomeranian |author= |date=09-12-22 |work= |publisher=Pets4You |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref> The breed is good for apartment living, and are very active indoors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://movingtoanapartment.com/pet-friendly-apartments/top-50-most-popular-apartment-dogs.htm |title=Top 50 Most Popular Apartment Dogs |author= |date=2007-11-27 |work= |publisher=MovingToAnApartment.com |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref>

===Common problems===
[[Merle (coat colour in dogs)|Merle]] colored dogs may suffer from mild to severe [[deafness]], increased [[intraocular pressure]], [[ametropia]], [[microphthalmia]] and [[colobomas]]. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both merles may additionally suffer from abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genmarkag.com/download/Factsheet_Merle_Gene.pdf |title=Merle Gene |author= |date= |work=GenMark |publisher= |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>

[[Luxating patellas]] is the most common health issue in the Pomeranian breed.<ref name="pomhealth"/> It occurs when through either malformation or trauma, the ridges forming the [[patellar]] grove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to "luxate" (jump out of the grove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground.<ref name="patellas">{{cite web |url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?c=1+1321&aid=457 |title=Luxating Patella |author= |date= |work=Drs. Foster & Smith, Inc |publisher=Pet Education.com |accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref>Whilst the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the [[femur]]. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc. This condition is more common among the smaller breeds, especially the [[Miniature Poodle|Miniature]] and [[Toy Poodle]]s.<ref name="patellas"/> 

[[image:Pomeranian Abashed.JPG|thumb|right|Close up of the [[muzzle]] and facial features of the Pomeranian.]]
[[Tracheal]] collapse is caused by a weakening of the the [[tracheal rings]] in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. It is commonly seen in Pomeranians and other small breed dogs such as [[Yorkshire Terrier]]s and [[Poodle]]s. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a [[Goose]] honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vetsurgerycentral.com/tracheal_collapse.htm |title=Tracheal Collapse |author=Degner, Dr. Daniel A. |date=2004 |work=Drs. Foster & Smith, Inc |publisher=Pet Education.com |accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref>

In Pomeranians, a condition often called "black skin disease" occurs which is a combination of [[alopecia]] (hair loss) and [[hyperpigmentation]] (a darkening of the skin). Other names for this condition include wooly coat, coat funk, psuedo-Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss syndrome. This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Several other breeds have this same skin disorder including the [[American Water Spaniel]], [[Dachshund]], [[Keeshond]] and [[Chow Chow]].<ref name="blackskin">{{cite web |url=http://www.pommania.co.uk/blackskindisease.htm |title=BSD - Black Skin Disease - Alopecia X - Coat Funk |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Pommania Pomeranains |accessdate=2009-11-30}}</ref> Although most affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can mimic this condition including [[Cushing's syndrome]], [[hypothyroidism]], chronic skin infections, and reproductive hormone disorders.<ref name="blackskin"/>

==History==

[[image:Pomeranian (Spitz) from 1915.JPG|thumb|right|A Pomeranian from 1915]]
===Origins===
The forerunners of today's Pomeranian breed were large working dogs from the [[Arctic]] regions. These dogs are commonly known as the Wolfspitz or [[Spitz]] type, which is [[German Language|German]] for "sharp point" which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th Century as a reference to the features of the dog's nose and muzzle. The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the [[German Spitz]].<ref name="vanderlip">{{cite book |title=The Pomeranian Handbook |last=Vanderlip |first=Sharon |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |location= |isbn=978-0764135453 |page= |pages=2&ndash;8 |url= |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref>

The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area which is now the northeast region of [[Germany]], known as [[Pomerania]]. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. However proper documentation was lacking until the pomeranian's introduction into the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name="vanderlip"/>

An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary entry in [[James Boswell]]'s ''Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland''. "The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of."<ref>{{cite book |title=Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland |last=Boswell |first=James|editor=Pottle, Frederick A. |authorlink=James Boswell |coauthors= |year=1764 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company Inc |edition=First |isbn= |page=165 |pages= |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/boswellonthegran006270mbp#page/n0/mode/2up |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref> The offspring of a Pomeranian and a [[wolf]] bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in [[Thomas Pennant]]'s ''A Tour in Scotland'' from 1769.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Tour in Scotland 1769 |last=Pennant|first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Pennant |coauthors= |year=1776 |publisher=Benj White |edition=Fourth |isbn= |page=195 |pages= |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vk8JAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=thomas+pennant+pomeranian&source=bl&ots=YIDBDNFkjy&sig=bD8BmaQsCFbLC3rTZE3pR5GWn2Q&hl=en&ei=GQgTS_-6FYL74AbAwMiEBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=pomeranian&f=false |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref>

A larger Pomeranian of the older type features.]]

Two members of the [[British Royal Family]] influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, [[Queen Charlotte]], [[Queen-consort]] of King [[George III of England]], brought two Pomeranians to England. Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir [[Thomas Gainsborough]]. These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as {{convert|30|-|50|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the back.<ref name="vanderlip"/>

[[Queen Victoria]], Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she named "Windor's Marco" and was reported to weigh only {{convert|12|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%.<ref name="vanderlip"/> Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians of different colors from various European countries to add to her breeding program.<Ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pomeranian.org/breed-profile |title=Pomeranian Profile |author=Denise Leo |date=2009 |work=Pomeranian.com|publisher= |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref> Royal owners during this period also included [[Jos<U+00E9>phine de Beauharnais]], wife of [[Napoleon I of France]] and King [[George IV of England]].

The first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards. The first member of the breed was registered in [[United States|America]] to the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1898, and it was recognised soon afterwards in 1900. Glen Rose Flashaway won the [[Toy Group]] at the [[Westminster Kennel Club]] Dog Show in 1926, the first Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster.<ref name="vanderlip"/> It would take until 1988 for the first [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show|Best in Show]] at Westminster, Great Elms Prince Charming II.<Ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/history/biswinners.html |title=Best in Show Winners |author= |date= |work=Westminster Kennel Club |publisher= |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref>

In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard, along with the [[Keeshond]], by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Cynologique Internationale]].<ref name="standard">{{cite web |url=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CAcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fci.be%2Fuploaded_files%2F097gb98_en.doc&rct=j&q=fci+german+spitz+pomeranian&ei=7hlFS6OvIYKI0wTsqp2SBQ&usg=AFQjCNFaTxbdduvIvta5pAv_k1YW8R10rg |title=FCI-Standard N<U+00B0> 97: GERMAN SPITZ, INCLUDING KEESHOND AND POMERANIAN |author= |date=1998-03-05 |work= |publisher=F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration Cynologique Internationale |accessdate=2010-01-06}}</ref> According to the standard "Spitz breeds are captivating" and have a "unique characteristic, cheeky appearance."<ref name="standard"/>
