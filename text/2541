==Early history==

Theories regarding the origins of the ancient Abhira&nbsp;<U+2014> the putative ancestors of the [[Ahirs]]&nbsp;<U+2014> are varied for the same reasons as are the theories regarding their location; that is, there is a reliance on interpretation of linguistic and factual analysis of old texts that are known to be unreliable and ambiguous.<ref name="Bhattacharya1996p126"/> [[S. D. S. Yadava]] describes how this situation impacts on theories of origin for the modern Ahir community because {{quote|Their origin is shrouded in mystery and is immersed in controversy, with many theories, most of which link the Ahirs to a people known to the ancients as the Abhiras.<ref name="Yadava2006p1">{{cite book |title=Followers of Krishna: Yadavas of India |first=S.

Bhagwan Singh Suryavanshi says archaeological research in Deccan has revealed the presence of pastoral people of the Neolithic era who shares many attributes of the Abhira. Hence, they might have been present much earlier than has been previously postulated so.

He concludes from the Padma [[Purana]], where [[Vishnu]] informed Abhiras, "I shall be born among you, O Abhiras, at Mathura in my eighth birth". D. R.
