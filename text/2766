'''St Deiniol's Church, Llanddaniel Fab''', is a small 19th-century church in the centre of [[Llanddaniel Fab]], a village in [[Anglesey]], north Wales. The first church in this location is said to have been established by [[St Deiniol Fab]] (to whom the church is dedicated) in 616. He was the son of [[St Deiniol]], the first [[Bishop of Bangor]]. The current building, which is in [[English Gothic architecture|Early English]] style, incorporates some material and fittings from an earlier church on the site, including the font and an 18th-century memorial in the porch.  The vestry door has medieval jambs and the keystone of its arch, which is also medieval, is a carved human face. Some parts of the nave walls may also come from a previous building here.

The church is no longer used for worship, and the village is now served by a church in [[Llanfairpwll]]. As of 2011, the building (without the surrounding grounds) was for sale. It is a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]], a national designation given to "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them",<ref name=Cadwlist>{{cite book|url=http://www.cadw.wales.gov.uk/upload/resourcepool/WhatIsListing_englishLR983.pdf|format=PDF|title=What is listing?|publisher=[[Cadw]]|year=2005|isbn=1857602226 |page=6}}</ref> in particular because it is regarded as "a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church".<ref name=List>{{cite web|url=http://jura.rcahms.gov.uk/cadw/cadw_eng.php?id=5455|title=Church of St Deiniol|author=[[Cadw]]|publisher=Historic Wales|date=2009|accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref>

==History and location==
The date of first construction of a Christian place of worship in [[Llanddaniel Fab]], [[Anglesey]], is uncertain, but it is said by 19th-century writers that a son of [[Deiniol|St Deiniol]] (the first [[Bishop of Bangor]]) established a church here in 616.<ref name=Llwyd/><ref name=Lewis/>  The son, also a saint, was known as [[St Deiniol Fab|''Deiniol Fab'']] (Welsh for "Deiniol the son"), to distinguish him from his father.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=47844#s4|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Wales |year=1849|chapter=Llanddaniel-Vab (Llan-Ddeiniol-Fab)|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|authorlink=Samuel Lewis (publisher)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/livesbritishsai04fishgoog#page/n357/mode/2up|page=332|title=The lives of the British Saints: the Saints of Wales and Cornwall and such Irish Saints as have dedications in Britain (volume 2)|authorlink=Sabine Baring-Gould|first=Sabine |last=Baring-Gould|year=1907|publisher=[[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]]}}</ref> No part of a building from that time survives.  A later edifice, dating from the 16th century or perhaps earlier, was replaced in the 19th century.  Some parts of that structure may have been reused in the current church, as the 1937 survey by the [[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]] considered that sections of the walls of the nave may be from the older building.<ref name=Jones/><ref name=RC>{{cite book|title=An Inventory of the Ancient Monuments in Anglesey|origyear=1937|year=1968|author=[[Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire]]|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|page=42|chapter=Llanddaniel-Fab}}</ref> In 1833 the antiquarian [[Angharad Llwyd]] described the old church as "a very ancient and dilapidated structure", which had "some good specimens of the architecture of a very remote period".<ref name=Llwyd>{{cite book|last=Llwyd|first=Angharad|authorlink=Angharad Llwyd |page=109|title=A History of the Island of Mona|origyear=1833|year=2007|publisher=Llyfrau Magma|location=[[Llansadwrn, Anglesey]]|isbn=1872773737}}</ref> Writing in 1846, the clergyman and antiquarian [[Harry Longueville Jones]] described it as one "so much altered by successive reparations, that little of its original architectural character has been preserved".<ref name=Jones>{{cite journal|first=Harry|last=Longueville Jones|authorlink=Harry Longueville Jones|date=1846|journal=Archaeologia Cambrensis|volume=1|publisher=[[Cambrian Archaeological Association]]|pages=434<U+2013>435|title=Mona Mediaeva No. IV|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/archaeologiacam03powegoog#page/n559/mode/2up|accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref>  Repairs were carried out to the new church, and a vestry added to the north side, in 1873.<ref name=List/><ref name=Lewis/> The work was overseen by Henry Kennedy, architect of the [[Diocese of Bangor]].<ref name=Anglesey>{{cite book|title=Anglesey Churches|page=71|isbn=1845270894|publisher=Carreg Gwalch|last=Jones|first=Geraint I.

The church is near the centre of Llanddaniel Fab, and is reached from the street by passing through a [[lychgate]] by the village war memorial.<ref name=List/> The village takes its name from the church; the Welsh word ''{{lang|cy|[[llan (placename element)|llan]]}}'' originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", and ''-ddaniel'' is a [[Colloquial Welsh morphology|modified form]] of the saint's name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/whatsinaname/sites/themes/pages/religion.shtml|title=Religion and creed in place names|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> The church is no longer in use; a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that no services had been held in the church for a number of years, and ivy was growing across the building.<ref name=Anglesey/> The church's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of [[Llanfairpwll]], now served by the church of [[St Mary's Church, Llanfairpwll|St Mary, Llanfairpwll]].<ref name=CinW>{{cite web|url= http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/rb/par.php?dosommat=detail&which=195 |title=Church in Wales: Benefices |accessdate=26 January 2011|publisher=[[Church in Wales]]}}</ref> As of January 2011, the church (without the grounds) was on sale for <U+00A3>50,000; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it could be used as a studio or for storage, subject to necessary consents being obtained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/sales/1403329|accessdate=26 January 2011|title=St Deiniol Fab, Llanddaniel Fab, Anglesey |publisher=Homes & Property|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w3jAkK1R|archivedate=27 January 2011}}</ref>

People associated with the church include the clergymen [[Henry Rowlands]] and [[Isaac Jones (clergyman)|Isaac Jones]].  Rowlands, who wrote a history of Anglesey (''Mona Antiqua Restaurata'') in 1723, served as priest here and in nearby parishes from 1696 onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-ROWL-HEN-1655.html|title=Rowlands, Henry (1655<U+2013>1723), antiquary|work=[[Welsh Biography Online]]|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|year=2009|accessdate=28 January 2011|last=Wright|first=Evan Gilbert}}</ref> Jones, a translator, was curate of St Deiniol's from 1840 until his death in 1850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-JONE-ISA-1804.html|title=Jones, Isaac (1804<U+2013>1850), cleric and translator|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=National Library of Wales|year=2009|accessdate=28 January 2011|last=Ellis|first=Thomas Iorwerth |authorlink=Thomas Iorwerth Ellis}}</ref>

==Architecture and fittings== 
The [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] church is in the [[English Gothic architecture|Early English style]]. It is built from [[rubble masonry]] dressed with [[limestone]] and has a slate roof. The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church. The door in the vestry's north wall has medieval door jambs, and the keystone of the pointed arch, which is also medieval, is a carved human face.<ref name=List/>

The nave of the church (where the congregation sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at the east end of the nave.<ref name=List/> There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, on the south side of the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north.<ref name=List/><ref name=Anglesey/> Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a [[bellcote]] surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by [[mullion]]s), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining [[lancet window]]s, the tallest in the middle.<ref name=List/> 

Internally, the walls have panelling at the bottom and painted plasterwork above.  The roof has exposed timbers. There is a pointed chancel arch and three steps between the nave and chancel, with a further step to the sanctuary, which has a mosaic floor. The east windows and those on the north have stained glass.<ref name=Anglesey/>  Fittings include the rectangular pulpit, the pews, and the altar table, which are all made of pine wood, and the octagonal font, made of granite with carvings on each side.<ref name=List/> The 1937 Royal Commission survey recorded that the church owned a plain silver cup, dated 1796<U+2013>1797.<ref name=RC/> A visual inspection of the church in 2006 determined that there were many cobwebs inside, but also that the pews and organ remained in place.<ref name=Jones/>

==Assessment==
The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]]&nbsp;<U+2013> the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them".<ref name=Cadwlist/> It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as "a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church".<ref name=List/> [[Cadw]] (the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) states that it is "coherently designed in an early Gothic style which is apt for its scale".<ref name=List/>
