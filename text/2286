'''Saint Evrard''' was a soldier in the court of [[Charlemagne]]--he was instrumental in the politics of the day.  He resided near present-day [[Lille, France]] ([[Cysoing]] is a village of Lille metro), and was [[Duke of Friuli|Duke of Frioul]] (Italian: ''Friuli'', French: ''Frioul'') from [[846]] to [[863]] (he inherited the title from his father<ref>''The Royal Ancestry Bible Royal Ancestors of 300 Colonial American Families'' by Michel L. Call (chart's 1986 & 2022) ISBN 1-933193-22-7</ref>).

He had a relationship with the theologian [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]].  Other known associates included [[Raban Maur]], Archbishop [[Hincmar]] of Reims, and [[Sedulius Scottus]].<ref>[http://home.scarlet.be/amdg/sankt/dec16.html Belgian and Celtic Saints] (French)</ref>

An alternative spelling of this name is "Erhard".  Also "Everardus" "Eberardus" "Eberard" "Eberhardus" "Eberhard".  He wrote his own name "EWRARDUS".<ref>[http://home.scarlet.be/amdg/sankt/dec16.html Belgian and Celtic Saints] (French)</ref>

He died [[December 16|16 December]] [[867]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>  His feast day is [[December 16|16 December]].<ref>[http://home.scarlet.be/amdg/sankt/dec16.html Belgian and Celtic Saints] (French)</ref>

=A note on notability:=
<blockquote>"Saint Evrard, Duke of [[March of Friuli|Frioul]] and son-in-law of [[Louis the Pious|Louis le D<U+00E9>bonaire]], was one of the principle personages of the [[Carolingian]] period.  As his name belongs to a great history, our region could, in right name, be re-vindicated as one of his glories.  [[Cysoing]], above all, has the right to call itself Saint Evrard's village.  The past of Saint Evrard and of the village of Cysoing are themselves intimately tied such that it is impossible to separate them.  One would excuse us for therefore reuniting them."<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]]).</ref></blockquote>

So reads the preface of an ecclesiatic work on Evrard and [[Cysoing]].  There was a "flurry" of research and publishing associated with the discovery of Evrard's body at [[Cysoing]] early in the twentieth century--this "flurry" was mostly limited to [[Lille]]/[[Roubaix]] and within elements of the Church.

=Family=
Evrard was from an illustrious [[Frankish]] family<ref>Sources : ''Chevalier''.  R<U+00E9>pertoires des sources historiques au mot ''Eberhard''.  ''Don Boquet''.

(Review Theories 2a and 2b from Disputed Parentage.)

=Education=
Saint Evrard lived in the ninth century.  He was born under the reign of [[Charlemagne]] and died under that of [[Charles the Bald]].

Saint Evrard was elevated to the court of [[Charlemagne]] and of [[Louis the Pious|Louis the D<U+00E9>bonaire]].  He took his education at the ''Palace School'' founded by [[Charlemagne]] and organized by [[Alcuin]], where he studied from the medieval programs known as the [[trivium (education)|trivium]] and the [[quadrivium]].  There he got a taste of the letters and sciences, at the same time that he developed his famous piety.<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

It is without doubt that it was at the ''Palace School'' that Saint Evrard began to build the rich library of which he enumerates the books with so much care in his will<ref>voir plus loin page 12</ref>.<ref>Translator : "C'est sans doute <U+00E0> l'Ecole du palais que saint Evrard commen<U+00E7>a <U+00E0> se composer cette riche biblioth<U+00E8>que dont il <U+00E9>num<U+00E8>re les livres avec tant de soin dans son testament."</ref>

=Warlike exploits and role as mediator under [[Louis the Pious|Louis le D<U+00E9>bonaire]]=
As soon as his age permitted him to carry arms, Saint Evrard took part in numerous military expeditions<ref>''Les Sires de Cysoing'' par Thierry Leuridan, p. 14</ref>.  Named Duke of Frioul and Count or Marquis<ref>''Les Sires de Cysoing'' par Thierry Leuridan, p. 14 -- Rerum gallicarum et francicarum scriptores '''''usw'''''</ref> de [[Treviso|Tr<U+00E9>vise]], in [[Italy]], he defended his country against invasion by the [[Bulgars]] and managed to completely drive these new barbarians from the peninsula--[[825]]-[[830]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

He rendered service unto [[Louis the Pious|Louis le D<U+00E9>bonaire]]  that was still more distinguished.  During the tragic years ([[830]]-[[839]]) where the emperor had suffered at the hand of his son's revolt the most indignified treatment, Count Evrard remained inviolably loyal.<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

He exercised his influence in [[Lothair I|Lothair]]'s sphere (the elder son of the emperor) to bring about a reconciliation between father and son.  It is certain that it was on his council in [[839]], that [[Lothair I|Lothaire]] went to ''[[Worms, Germany|Worms]]'' to implore the pardon of his father<ref>''Les Sires de Cysoing'' par Thierry Leuridan</ref>.

=Marriage to the [[princess Gis<U+00E8>le]]; their stay at [[Cysoing]]=
In return for his services, the emperor [[Louis the Pious|Louis le D<U+00E9>bonaire]] gave Count Evrard the highest honor possible: the hand of his (aknowledged) daughter, the [[Princess Gis<U+00E8>le]], in marriage.

The [[Princess Gis<U+00E8>le]], a woman of piety and virtue<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>, was the daughter of [[Louis the Pious|Louis le D<U+00E9>bonaire]] and his second wife, the empress [[Judith (died 843)|Judith]]<ref>''Les Sires de Cysoing'' par Thierry Leuridan</ref>.

Among the rich domains the Princess brought with her in her dowry, Count Evrard found the [[fisc]] of [[Cysoing]].

One gives the name [[fisc]], in this age, to large, rural properties separate from the royal domains; that is, to sorts of farms with a residence for the master and homes for settlers<ref>''Les sires de Cysoing'' par Thierry Leuridan p.11</ref>.

The Royal [[Fisc]] of [[Cysoing]], situated at the center of the country of [[P<U+00E8>vele]], was one of the most beautiful in the region.  The stay seemed so agreeable to Saint Evrard and the [[Princess Gis<U+00E8>le]] that they made it one of their regular residences.<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

The [[chateau|castle]] which they inhabited was without doubt the same as that of the [[lords of Cysoing]] in following centuries.  It found itself part of a magnificent property, surrounded by water, that actually belongs to the family [[Bigo-Vanderhagen]].  The farming ditches were marked in the oldest documents<ref>Rapports de la baronnie de Cysoing 1392, 1455, 1595.  Archives d<U+00E9>partementales.  Etat g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral 81, 82, 88.</ref>.  It is not rash to think these were dug in Saint Evrard's time, or perhaps even earlier<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>.

Already, in the century before (in [[752]]), the little hamlet established on the royal [[fisc]] of [[Cysoing]] has been made famous through the martyrdom of [[Saint Arnoul of Cysoing|Saint Arnoul]]<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>.

[[Saint Arnoul of Cysoing|Saint Arnoul]], a courageous warrior, who was, it is said, the father of [[Godefroid]], Bishop of [[Cambrai]] and [[Arras]], had been attached to the court of a noble lord, his relative.  "His virtues and his merits were so radiant that God accorded his prayers more than one miracle during his life.  He became even more glorious through his martyrdom."<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>  He was so devoted to his master that he eventually died for him<ref>Acta sanctorum II p. 971.  Cartul. de Cys. p. 768, 905, 914, 919.</ref> thus attaining martyrdom<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>.

[[Saint Arnoul of Cysoing|Saint Arnoul]] was already honored at [[Cysoing]] when Saint Evrard and [[Princess Gis<U+00E8>le]] went to take possession of their domain.  His relics were conserved there.  [[Cysoing]], of this age, has therefore ''a church'', or less ''a chappel'' that was without doubt the same chappel as the royal [[fisc]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

=Founding of the [[Abbey at Cysoing]]=
Saint Evrard, at [[Cysoing]], had a chaplain named [[Walgaire]]<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>.  They (Evrard and Gis<U+00E8>le) decided to found a [[monastery]] at [[Cysoing]].  The project was long and difficult, and was not complete at the time of Evrard's or Gis<U+00E8>le's deaths.  The [[monastery]] was initially made in honor of [[Saint Saveur]] and Mary (mother of Jesus, not Magdalene).  The religious lived there under canon law in a community with all the rigors of the cloister.  Their special function was singing solemnly in the church.  They maintained public prayer.  Saint Evrard was known to enjoy singing with the choir.<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

After his later campaigns in the defense of Italy, the remains of [[Pope Callixtus I]] were reinterred in the [[Abbey at Cysoing]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]]).</ref><ref>[http://home.scarlet.be/amdg/sankt/dec16.html Belgian and Celtic Saints] (French)</ref>

=Virtues of Saint Evrard=
Saint Evrard, himself, has organized his home in a way so perfectly that it was more like a [[monastery]] than a [[chateau|castle]].  He was seconded in this task by his pious wife, Gis<U+00E8>le, who dedicated herself to the education of their many children.  The poor and ill were sure of finding not only banal security at [[Cysoing]], but also help and protection.  The social question of the time, that of [[serfs]], also preoccupied Saint Evrard.  He had freed a good number.  In their testimony, he expressly refrained from impeding their liberty.  He never forgot those who he didn't free, and tried to improve their lots.  Though he was a courageous and formidable, he worked all his life for peace.  His private vertues were no less remarkable.  In his elevated position, he strove to preserve modisty and humility, to avoid spleandour and arrogance.  His zeal for the glory of God, to spread the Truth, to convert the infidels, was celebrated throughout the Church.  Alas, his piety, his taste for ceremonies of worship, he devotion to the saints, his respect for the precious relics was apparent in his every act.<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

=Saint Evrard, Pacifier=
Saint Evrard's activity was not limited to the royal [[fisc]] of [[Cysoing]], as he involved himself freely with matters of other domaines and the empire in general.  Emperor [[Louis the Pious|Louis the Debonaire]]  went to die ([[840]]) and the war, a cruel war without mercy, exploded between the Emperor [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothaire]] and his two brothers, [[Louis the German|Louis le Germanique]] and [[Charles the Bald]].  Saint Evrard strongly deplored this fighting/battling and fratricide and made all efforts to bring it to an end.  After the bloody [[Battle of Fontenay (841)|battle of Fontenay]] ([[June 25|25 June]] [[841]]), he left the ambassadorial envoy of [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothaire]] near that of [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothaire]]'s brothers for peace negotiations.  The preparatory conference took place in [[842]] at [[Milin]], near [[Ch<U+00E2>lons-en-Champagne|Ch<U+00E2>lons]] in [[Champagne]].  It was decided to divide the empire between the three brothers.  The negotiators, among which Evrard could be found, were charged with making the partitioning equitable/fair.  It was not before August of [[843]] that they presented their report to the three kigs at [[Verdun]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

=Versus the [[Saracens]] (North African Muslims)=
The negotiations ended and peace was re-established between the three brothers, Saint Evrard left in haste for [[Italy]].  [[Italy]] was under threat from "[[African Saracens]]".  These Saracens<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref> had been named as helpers, in [[842]], by the [[Duke of B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>vent]] and they would soon become a threat to regimes throughout the peninsula.  They menaced [[Rome]] and pillaged it many times.  Saint Evrard, in his station as [[Duke of Frioul]], was made a captain/leader of the resistance.  The war wore on for several years and ended in [[851]] with the defeat of the [[Saracens]].

"Evrard has a reputation for being both a courageous soldier and able leader throughout these battles.  In the tradition of [[Charlemagne]], Evrard forced the vanquished to convert to [[Christianity]], meritoriously teaching them the Gospel, himself."<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

=Renaming of Saint Evrard in the Church=
Saint Evrard had played a large role in this victory.  A large service was held in his honor by the Church and his country.  In this way his name had come to be celebrated in all of Christianity.  The most pious [[Prelats]] and the most illustrious members of the Church sought his friendship....<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

=Saint Evrard's last years; his will; his death=
Sometime after this solemnity, Saint Evrard returned to [[Italy]].  We find him in [[858]] among the ambassadors who the emperor [[Louis the Younger|Louis le Jeune]], son of [[Lothaire]], sent to [[Ulm]], near his uncle [[Louis the German|Louis le Germanique]].  After this date, we know nothing more about Saint Evrard until his Testimony, a very interesting/curious/strange document, whose authenticity is certain and in which we are given information on the life of Saint Evrard...  This Testimony was made in [[Italy]], at [[Musiestro Castle]], in the county of [[Treviso|Tr<U+00E9>vise]], in [[867]].  With the agreement of his spouse, [[Princess Gis<U+00E8>le]], Saint Evrard portioned his goods among his seven children.<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

=Division of Properties/Inheritances=
The eldest, ''[[Unruoch III of Friuli|Unroch]]'', got all properties in [[Lombardy]] and [[Germany]].  the second, ''[[Berengar I of Italy|B<U+00E8>renger]]'', got [[Annappes]] with its dedepencencies less [[Gruson]] and the other properties in the [[Hesbaye]] and in the [[Condrost]].  The third, ''[[Ad<U+00E9>lard]]'', got the lands of [[Cysoing]], [[Camphin]], [[Gruson]] and [[Somain]], with charges and respects of all the properties of the Abbey in these regions.  The fourth, ''[[Rodolphe]]'', got [[Vitry-en-Artois]] and [[Mestucha]], except for the church at [[Vitry]] which was given with the [[Abbey at Cysoing]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>

The three daughters of Saint Evrard, ''[[Ingletrude]]'', ''[[Judith]]'' and ''[[Heilwich]]'', got various other domains : [[Ermen]], [[Marshem]], [[Balghingham]], [[Heliwsheim]], [[Hostrenheim]], [[Luisinga]], [[Wendossa]], [[Engerresteim]].  Saint Evrard had another daughter who carried the name of Gis<U+00E8>le, her mother.  But she was dead at the time of his testimony.  The testimony split equally the jewels and ornaments of the saint, the precious objects of his chappel and the books of his library.  It is dated [[867]], the 28th year of the reign of [[Lothaire]]'s son, [[Louis the Younger|Louis le Jeune]].  Saint Evrard died the same year, [[December 16|16 December]].<ref>"Saint Evrard : Fondateur de L'Abbaye de Cysoing : Son Culte & Ses Reliques" by Abbott Jules BATAILLE([[1902]])</ref>
