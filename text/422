The '''Moore School of business''' is the business school of [[University of South Carolina Columbia|University of South Carolina]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], [[South Carolina]],  [[United States]]. The university founded the Moore School in 1919 and it has shown strong performance by ranking publications in international business.  It currently enrolls over 3,700 students in degree-seeking programs.  These programs include [[bachelor degree|bachelor]], [[masters degree|masters]] and [[doctorate degree|doctorate]] degrees.

== History ==
The University of South Carolina began efforts to open a school of commerce as early as [[1914]]. USC founded the school in [[1919]] and dean George Olson firmly established the school by the early [[1920s]].  The school grew with the university.  In [[1958]], the school established the [[MBA|Masters of Business Administration]] program.  By 1963, [[AACSB]] gave the school full accreditation.

[[Image:MooreDarla.jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[Darla Moore]] has donated $70 million to the school and the Moore School of Business is named in her honor.]]
The Professional Masters of Business Administration (PMBA, but then called MBA-ETV) started in [[1970]].  The PMBA program allows people in South Carolina to receive an MBA by taking part-time classes at remote locations and over the internet.  Then in [[1974]] the school established its Masters of International Business (MIBS).  National publications hold the program in high esteem and the program continuously garners high rankings in international business. 

In [[1998]], [[Wall Street]] financier and USC graduate [[Darla Moore]] donated $25 million to the business school. In her honor the school was renamed Darla Moore School of Business. The first name was dropped shortly thereafter and the school is now officially called The Moore School of Business.

In [[2001]] [[Joel A. Smith III]], a former [[Bank of America]] Executive was appointed to be the [[dean (education)|dean]] of the Moore School.

The school combined its MIBS and MBA programs to form the IMBA program in [[2002]].  The same year, the school started offering a specialization in international business for undergraduate students as a major. 

On [[April 23]], [[2004]] the Business School announced another gift by Darla Moore. She donated $45 million with the challenge to the University to match that sum. The funds are dedicated to a complete renovation of the Hipp-Close building and to increase the school's endowment.

Then around May 1, students begin a mandatory internship, usually in the language they studied.
