The '''sambar''' (''Rusa unicolor'') is a large [[deer]] native to the [[Indian Subcontinent]], [[South China|southern China]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Although it primarily refers to ''R. unicolor'', the name "sambar" is also sometimes used to refer to the [[Philippine deer]] (called the Philippine sambar) and the [[rusa deer]] (called the Sunda sambar). The name is also spelled ''sambur'', or ''sambhur''.

== Description ==
[[File:4. antlers unicolor.png|thumb|left|Drawing of skull]]
The appearance and the size of sambar vary widely across their range, which has led to considerable taxonomic confusion in the past; over forty different scientific [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s have been used for the species. In general, they attain a height of {{convert|102|to|160|cm}} at the shoulder and may weigh as much as {{convert|546|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, though more typically {{convert|100|to|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Burnie">Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), ''Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife''.

The large, rugged [[antler]]s are typically [[Rusa (genus)|rusine]], the brow tines being simple and the beams forked at the tip, so that they have only three [[tine (structural)|tine]]s. The antlers are typically up to {{convert|110|cm|in|abbr=on}} long in fully adult individuals. As with most deer, only the males have antlers.<ref name=Leslie2011/>

The shaggy coat can be anything from yellowish-brown to dark grey in colour and, while it is usually uniform in colour, some subspecies have  chestnut marks on the rump and underparts. Sambar also have a small but dense mane, which tends to be more prominent in males. The tail is relatively long for deer, and is generally black above with a whitish underside.<ref name=Leslie2011/>

Adult males and pregnant or lactating females possess an unusual hairless, blood-red spot located about halfway down the underside of their throats. This sometimes oozes a white liquid, and is apparently glandular in nature.<ref name="Valerius 2008"/>

==Range and ecology==
[[File:Rusa unicolor.png|thumb|Range of the sambar deer]]
The sambar inhabits much of [[southern Asia]] (as far north as the south-facing slopes of the [[Himalayan Mountains]]), mainland [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Burma]], [[Thailand]], [[Indochina]], the [[Malay Peninsula]]), [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] (including [[Hainan]] Island), [[Taiwan]], and the islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]].<ref name=iucn/>

Sambar are found in habitats ranging from tropical seasonal forests ([[tropical dry forests]] and seasonal moist evergreen forests), subtropical mixed forests (conifers, broadleaf deciduous, and broadleaf evergreen tree species) to [[tropical rainforest]]s.<ref name=iucn/>  They are seldom found far from water. They are hardy animals, ranging from sea level up to {{convert|3500|m}} in places such as eastern Taiwan, Myanmar, and the foothills of the [[Himalayan Mountains]].<ref name=iucn/>
[[File:Sambar Stag.jpg|left|thumb|Sambar stag browsing.]]

Sambar prefer the dense cover of deciduous shrubs and grasses,<ref name="Valerius 2008"/> although the exact nature of this varies enormously with the environment, because of their wide range across southern Asia. Home range sizes are probably equally variable, but have been recorded as {{convert|1500|ha}} for males and {{convert|300|ha}} for females in India.<ref name=Leslie2011/>

Sambar primarily live in woodland and feed on a wide variety of vegetation, including grasses, foliage, browse, fruit, and water plants, depending on the local habitat.<ref name="Valerius 2008">Valerius Geist (1998) ''Deer of the world: their evolution, behaviour, and ecology.'' Stackpole Books. 1998. pp. 73<U+2013>77.</ref> They also consume a great variety of shrubs and trees.<ref name=Leslie2011/> They are a favourite prey item for [[tiger]]s and [[Asiatic lion]]s. In [[India]], the sambar can comprise up to nearly 60% of the prey selected by the [[Bengal tiger]].<ref name= Old>{{cite journal|title=Food habits and prey selection of tiger and leopard in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, Tamil Nadu, India |url=http://oldwww.wii.gov.in/publications/researchpapers/2009/2009_Ramesh_food%20habits.pdf |author=T.

[[Leopard]]s and [[dhole]]s largely prey on only young or sickly deer, though can attack healthy adults as well.<ref name=iucn/>
[[File:2012-bandipur-dhole-sambar.jpg|thumb|Sambar attacked by [[dhole]]s, [[Bandipur National Park]]]]

Sambar have been seen congregating in large herds in protected areas such as national parks and reserves in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]]. In Taiwan, sambar, along with [[sika deer]], have been raised on farms for their antlers, which they drop annually in April to May and are highly prized for use as [[knife]] [[handle (grip)|handles]] and as [[handle (grip)|grips]] for [[handgun]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-knife-connection.com/handle-materials--india-sambar-stag.html |title=Handle Materials |publisher=The Knife Connection |date= |accessdate=2012-03-11}}</ref>

==Behavior and life history==
Sambar are nocturnal or [[crepuscular]]. The males live alone for much of the year, and the females live in small herds of up to sixteen individuals. Indeed, in some areas, the average herd consists of only three or four individuals, typically consisting of an adult female, her most recent young, and perhaps a subordinate, immature female. This is an unusual pattern for deer, which more commonly live in larger groups. They often congregate near water, and are good swimmers.<ref name=Leslie2011/> Like most deer, sambar are generally quiet, although all adults can scream or make short, high-pitched sounds when alarmed. However, they more commonly communicate by [[scent marking]] and foot stamping.
[[File:Sambar deers.jpg|thumb|left|Sambar hind with young stag.]]

Stags will wallow and dig their antlers in urine soaked soil and then rub against tree trunks.<ref name="Valerius 2008"/><ref name="Schaller 1967"/> Sambars are capable of remarkable bipedalism for a deer species and stags will stand and mark tree branches above them with their antlers.<ref name="Schaller 1967"/> A stag will also mark himself by [[Self-anointing in animals#Ungulates|spraying urine directly in his own face]] with [[deer penis|a highly mobile penis]].<ref name="Valerius 2008"/> Despite their lack of antlers, female sambar will readily defend their young from most predators, something that is relatively unusual among deer. When confronted by pack-hunting dholes or domestic dogs, a sambar will lower its head with an erect mane and lash at the dogs. Sambars prefer to attack predators in shallow water. Several sambars may form a defensive formation, touching rumps and vocalising loudly at the dogs.<ref name="Valerius 2008"/> When sensing danger a sambar will stamp its feet and make a ringing call known as "pooking" or "belling".<ref name="Schaller 1967"/>

[[File:Young sambar.jpg|thumb|Juvenile sambar]]
Though they mate and reproduce year-round, sambar calving peaks seasonally. [[Oestrus]] lasts around eighteen days. The male establishes a territory from which he attracts nearby females, but he does not establish a harem. The male stomps the ground, creating a bare patch, and often wallows in the mud, perhaps to accentuate the colour of his hair, which is typically darker than that of females. While they have been heard to make a loud coarse bellow, rutting stags are generally not vocal.<ref name=Leslie2011/> Large dominant stags will defend non-exclusive territories surrounded by several smaller males<ref name="Schaller 1967">George Schaller (1967) ''The Deer and the Tiger: A Study of Wildlife in India.'' University Of Chicago Press. pp. 134<U+2013>148.</ref> which they have bonded and formed alliances with through sparring. When sparring with rival males, sambar lock antlers and push, like other deer, but, uniquely, they also sometimes stand on their hind legs and clash downward into each other<ref name="Valerius 2008"/> in a manner similar to species of [[goat-antelope]]. Females also fight on their hind legs and use their forelegs to hit each other in the head.<ref name=Leslie2011/>

Courtship is based more on tending bonds rather than males vocally advertising themselves.<ref name="Valerius 2008"/> Females moving widely among breeding territories seeking males to court.<ref name=Leslie2011/> When mounting, males do not clasp females. The front legs of the male hang loosely and intromission takes the form of a "[[copulatory jump]]".<ref name="Valerius 2008"/><ref name="Schaller 1967"/>

Gestation probably lasts around eight months, although some studies suggest it may be slightly longer. Normally only one calf is born at a time, although twins have been reported in up to 2% of births. Initially weighing {{convert|5|to|8|kg}}, the calves are usually not spotted, although in some subspecies there are light spots which disappear not long after birth.<ref name=Leslie2011/> The young begin to take solid food at 5 to 14 days, and begin to ruminate after one month.<ref name=Semiadi1993>{{cite journal | author = Semiadi, G.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
[[File:Sambar deer at brt.JPG|thumb|[[Biligiriranga Hills]](BR-Hills), [[Karnataka]], [[India]]]]
Genetic analysis shows that the closest living relative of the sambar is probably the [[Javan Rusa|Javan rusa]] of Indonesia.<ref name=Emerson1993>{{cite journal | author = Emerson, B.C. & Tate M.L. | year = 1993 | title = Genetic analysis of evolutionary relationships among deer (subfamily Cervinae) | journal = Journal of Heredity | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/content/84/4/266.abstract | pages = 266<U+2013>273 | pmid = 8340615}}</ref> This is supported by reports that sambar can still interbreed to produce fertile hybrids with this species.<ref name=Leslie2011/>

Fossil sambar are known from the early [[Pleistocene]], although it is very similar in form to early deer species from the [[Pliocene]], with less of a resemblance to more modern cervines. The species probably arose in the tropical reaches of southern Asia, and later spread across its current range. ''[[Epirusa]]'' and ''[[Eucladoceros]]'' have both been proposed as possible ancestors of the living species and its closest relatives.<ref name=Leslie2011/>

===Subspecies===
The subspecies of sambar in India and Sri Lanka are the largest of the genus with the largest antlers both in size and in body proportions.  The South China sambar of Southern China and Mainland Southeast Asia is probably second in terms of size with slightly smaller antlers than the Indian sambar.  The Sumatran sambar, that inhabits the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, and the Bornean sambar seem to have the smallest antlers in proportion to their body size.  The Formosan sambar is the smallest ''Rusa unicolor'' with antler-body proportions more similar to the South China sambar.

Currently, seven subspecies of sambar are recognised,<ref name=Leslie2011/><ref name=msw3>Wilson, D.E., Reeder, D.M. (eds.) (2005) Mammal Species
of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference (3rd ed), Johns Hopkins University Press [http://www.bucknell.edu/msw3/browse.asp?id=14000004 online]</ref> although many others have been proposed.

==Introduced animal==
Sambar deer are an introduced species in both Australia and New Zealand, as they are in other parts of the world, such as the United States.

===Australia===
In Australia, hunting them is a popular sport.  Australian hunting fraternities consider large sambar trophies to be prized.<ref>Ken Pearce (1992) ''Walking Them Up'', Australian Deer Research Foundation, ISBN 0959343881 pp. xi<U+2013>xv</ref> Excessive numbers of sambar deer also have an impact on native plants, which is of particular concern as they threaten to cause some plant species to become extinct.

Sambar were originally introduced into Victoria at [[Mount Sugarloaf]] in the 1860s, near the present [[Kinglake National Park]], and at Harewood Estate near Tooradin, where they quickly adapted to the Koo Ree Wup coastal ti tree swamps and thereafter spread into the high country, where today the state herd may number as high as 100,000 animals. Later releases were at Ercildoune Estate near Ballarat, Wilsons Promontory and French Island in Western Port. Another release occurred on the Cobourg Peninsula in the Northern Territory.<ref>Arthur Bentley (1978) ''An Introduction to the Deer of Australia'', Australian Deer Research Foundation, ISBN 0958573212 pp. 32<U+2013>37</ref> They are now found throughout Australia's northern and eastern coasts, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]]. 
[[File:Sambar chennai.jpg|thumb|left|Young sambar]]
In Victoria, sambar deer have been listed as a threat to biodiversity under the [[Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988)]] because of their negative impact on biodiversity of native vegetation.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070919124417/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenpa.nsf/LinkView/EADA0F1874AF9CF24A2567C1001020A388BBA5581CF9D859CA256BB300271BDB Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act <U+2013> Processes List (updated December 2007) (PDF <U+2013> 33 KB)]. dse.vic.gov.au</ref> The animals feed on some rare and endangered plants. More than 60 plant species have been identified as directly or indirectly [[threatened species|threatened]] by sambar within Victoria.

Adult male sambar deer can significantly damage plants, removing most branches on some shrubs and sometimes [[ringbarking]] trees by thrashing their antlers on shrubs and sapling trees. They also feed on seedlings, fruit or seeds of many plants. They leave territorial marks to  advertise their territory.<ref>[http://archive.premier.vic.gov.au/newsroom/3230.html OpenDocument Media Release: New Plan Needed To Manage Impact Of Sambar Deer]. Minister for Environment & Climate Change (28 November 2007)</ref>

The spread of sambar has been steady in both NSW and Victoria, with animals being seen on many southern Victorian beaches since 1980, and as far east as Western Port and the outer suburbs of Melbourne.

There is a considerable debate about how they should be managed, in particular, conservation groups believe their environmental impact outweighs their social value, although this is contested by hunting organisations who aim to preserve deer populations for future generations. Sambar deer are currently listed as protected wildlife game species in Victoria and New South Wales, and a game licence is required to hunt them. They are declared pest species in in all other Australian states and territories and can be hunted at any time with no bag limits. Environmental and conservation groups want them declared a feral species in all states, due to their exploding populations and negative impact on biodiversity and native species.

In 2008/2009 35,000 sambar were removed from public land in Victoria, many from National Parks, by amateur hunters. Although this is a small fraction of the 40% of individuals in a sambar population that need to be removed just to stop population growth.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], sambar deer roam the coast and gullies in [[Horowhenua]], [[Manawatu]], [[Rangitikei, New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Wanganui]]. Until recently they were protected, but the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation]] has now removed hunting regulations surrounding them, allowing them now to be hunted year round.<ref>[http://www.doc.govt.nz/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/animal-pests-a-z/deer/docs-work/ Deer: DOC's work]. Department of Conservation (date=20 November 2013)</ref>

===United States===
Sambar deer were introduced onto [[St. Vincent Island, Florida]] in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sambar Deer <U+2013> ''Cervus unicolor''|work=Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission |url=http://myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/mammals/sambar-deer/}}</ref> [[Whitetail deer]] also live on St. Vincent Island; however they inhabit the highlands while the sambar deer mostly live in the lowlands and marshes. To ensure that the sambar deer population does not disrupt the native whitetails, hunting permits have been issued since 1987 to regulate the population. Each year about 130 permits are offered for the three day hunt. This maintains a sambar deer population of 70<U+2013>100 individuals.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Henry Cabbage |title=Going after 600-pound sambar deer in Florida!|journal=Florida Wildlife Magazine |pages=39<U+2013>41|date=May<U+2013>June 2006|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090320004004/http://floridawildlifemagazine.com/pdfs/may06sambardeer.pdf}}</ref>
