The '''War of the Bavarian Succession''' (July 1778 <U+2013> May 1779) was fought between the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and a [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]]<U+2013>[[Prussia]]n alliance to prevent the Habsburg acquisition of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]]. The war had no battles beyond a few minor skirmishes, but still resulted in significant casualties, as several thousand soldiers died from disease and starvation. Reflecting the soldiers' frustrating quest for food and forage, the conflict was also called the ''Kartoffelkrieg'' (Potato War) in [[Prussia]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]]; in [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], it was sometimes called the ''Zwetschgenrummel'' (Plum Fuss).

On 30 December 1777, [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian Joseph]], the last of the [[Treaty of Pavia (1329)|junior line of Wittelsbach]], died of [[smallpox]], leaving no children. [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles IV Theodore]], a scion of a senior branch of the [[House of Wittelsbach]], held the closest claim of kinship, but he, too, had no legitimate children to succeed him. His cousin, [[Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr<U+00FC>cken]], therefore had a legitimate legal claim as Charles Theodore's heir presumptive. Across Bavaria's southern border, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph, Archduke of Austria]], coveted the Bavarian territory and had married Max Joseph's sister in 1765 to strengthen any claim he could extend. His agreement with the heir, Charles Theodore, to partition the territory did not take into account any claims of the heir presumptive, Charles August.

The acquisition of territory in the German-speaking states was an essential part of Joseph's policy to expand his family's influence in Central Europe. For [[Frederick II of Prussia]], Joseph's claim threatened the [[Hohenzollern]] ascendancy in German politics, but he questioned whether or not he should preserve the ''status quo'' through war or through diplomacy. [[Empress Maria Theresa]], who co-ruled with Joseph, considered any conflict over the Bavarian electorate not worth the cost. Neither Maria Theresa nor Frederick saw any point in pursuing hostilities. Joseph would not drop his claim, despite his mother's insistence. [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] wanted to preserve the territorial integrity of the Duchy for his brother-in-law, Charles August, and had no interest in seeing the Habsburgs acquire additional territory on his southern and western borders. France became involved to maintain the [[European balance of power|balance of power]]. Finally, [[Catherine II of Russia]]'s threat to intervene on the side of Prussia with 50,000&nbsp;Russian troops forced Joseph to reconsider his position. With Catherine's assistance, he and Frederick negotiated a solution to the problem of the Bavarian succession with the [[Treaty of Teschen]], signed in May 1779.

For some historians, the War of the Bavarian Succession was the last of the old-style Cabinet Wars (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'') of the ''[[Ancien R<U+00E9>gime]]'' in which troops maneuvered while diplomats traveled between capitals to resolve their monarchs' complaints. The subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] differed in scope, strategy, organization and tactics. Historians of 19th- and 20th-century Germany have also found the roots of [[German dualism]] in this brief war.

==Background==
===Imperial competition===
{{details|War of the Austrian Succession}}
In 1713, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], established a line of succession that passed over the children of his sisters and the female children of his brother and settled the Habsburg territories on his own sons, if he had any, or his daughters. To protect the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] inheritance, he coerced, cajoled, and persuaded the crowned heads of Europe to accept the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]]. In this agreement, they acknowledged any of his legitimate daughters as the rightful Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and Archduchess of Austria, a break from the tradition of male succession.<ref>Michael Hochedlinger. ''Austria's Wars of Emergence, 1683<U+2013>1799.'' London: Longman, 2003, p. 246.</ref>

[[Holy Roman Emperor]]s had been elected from the House of Habsburg for most of the previous three centuries. Charles VI arranged a marriage of his eldest daughter, [[Empress Maria Theresa|Maria Theresa]], to [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis of Lorraine]]. Francis relinquished the [[Lorraine (duchy)|Duchy of Lorraine]] near France in exchange for the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] near Austria, to make himself a more appealing candidate for eventual election as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name="Dill4950">Marshall Dill. ''Germany: A Modern History.'' Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1970, pp. 49<U+2013>50.</ref> On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next Holy Roman Emperor. Two key exceptions, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] and [[Saxony]], held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis's election.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 246.</ref> When Charles died in 1740, his daughter, Maria Theresa, had to fight for her family's entitlements in Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, and her husband faced competition in his election as the Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name="Dill4950" />

Upon his death, several men sought to divide the duchy.]]
[[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria]], claimed the German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a son-in-law of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor]], and, furthermore, presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate Imperial successor. Charles of Bavaria's [[Order of succession|claim to the crown]] reflected the genealogical ''[[raison d'<U+00E9>tat]]''. If women were going to inherit, he claimed, then he should be first in line: his wife, [[Maria_Amalia_of_Austria|Maria Amalia]], was the daughter of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]]. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI.<ref>Dill, pp. 49<U+2013>50; [[Hajo Holborn]]. ''A History of Modern Germany, The Reformation'', Princeton NJ, Princeton University Press, 1959, pp. 191<U+2013>247.</ref> For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.<ref>Alfred Benians. ''Cambridge Modern History''. volume 6, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1901<U+2013>1912, pp. 230<U+2013>233; Dill, pp. 49<U+2013>50; Holborn, pp. 191<U+2013>247.</ref>

Charles of Bavaria needed military assistance to take the Imperial title by force and he secured this with the treaty of [[Nymphenburg Palace|Nymphenburg]] (July 1741). During the subsequent [[War of the Austrian Succession]], he successfully captured [[Prague]], where he was crowned [[King of Bohemia]]. He invaded [[Upper Austria]], planning to capture [[Vienna]], but diplomatic exigencies complicated his plans. His French allies redirected their troops into [[Bohemia]], where [[Frederick II of Prussia]], himself newly king, had taken advantage of the chaos in Austria and Bavaria to annex Silesia.<ref name="BDH">Benians, pp. 230<U+2013>233; Dill, pp. 49<U+2013>50; Holborn, pp. 191<U+2013>247.</ref>

Charles' military options disappeared with the French. Adopting a new plan, he subverted the Imperial election. He sold the [[County of Glatz]] to Frederick of Prussia for a reduced price in exchange for Frederick's electoral vote. Charles' brother, [[Klemens August of Bavaria]], archbishop and [[prince-elector]] of the [[Electorate of Cologne]], voted for him in the Imperial election and personally crowned him on 12 February 1742 in the traditional ceremony in [[Frankfurt am Main]]. The next day, Charles' Bavarian capital city of [[Munich]] capitulated to the Austrians to avoid being plundered by Maria Theresa's troops. In the following weeks, her army overran most of Charles' territories, occupied [[Bavaria]], and barred him from his ancestral lands and from Bohemia.<ref name="BDH"/>

Charles VII spent most of his three-year reign as Emperor residing in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the [[gout|gout-ridden]] Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, [[Maximilian III, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III Joseph]]<U+2014>known as Max Joseph<U+2014>inherited his father's Electoral dignities, but not his father's Imperial ambition. With the [[Peace of F<U+00FC>ssen]] (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, in the pending Imperial election. He also acknowledged the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family's Electoral position and territories.<ref> Hochedlinger, p. 258.</ref> For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare and brought a generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father's death in 1745 and ended with his own in 1777.<ref>Charles Ingrao.

As the [[Duke of Bavaria]], Max Joseph was the prince of one of the largest states in the German-speaking portion of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As a [[Prince-elector]], he stood in the highest social category of the Empire, with broad legal, economic, and juridical rights. As an Elector, he was one of the men who selected the Holy Roman Emperor from a group of candidates.<ref>See Holborn, pp. 191<U+2013>247, for general descriptions of the status of the Electors in the Holy Roman Empire.</ref> He was the son of one Holy Roman Emperor (Charles VII), and the grandson of another (Joseph I). Despite the Peace of F<U+00FC>ssen, any of his children could lay a claim to the Imperial title. When he died of [[smallpox]] on 30 December 1777, this genealogical claim became moot: he left no children to succeed him and several ambitious men prepared to carve his patrimony into pieces.<ref>Jean Berenger.

===Heir apparent===
The [[Palatinate-Sulzbach|Sulzbach]] branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the [[Duchy]] of Bavaria. In this line, the 55-year-old [[Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria|Charles IV Theodore]], the [[Duchy of J<U+00FC>lich|Duke of Berg-J<U+00FC>lich]], held the first claim. Unfortunately for Charles Theodore, he was already the [[Elector Palatine]]. By the terms of the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], he had to cede the Palatine Electorate to his own heir before he could claim the Bavarian Electorate. He was not eager to do so, even though Bavaria was larger and more important. He preferred living in the Palatinate, with its salubrious climate and compatible social scene. He patronized the arts, and had developed in [[Mannheim]], his capital city, an array of theaters and museums at tremendous cost to his subjects. He hosted [[Voltaire]] at one of his many palaces. During the visit, he had enticed Voltaire's secretary, the [[Florence|Florentine]] noble, Cosimo Alessandro Collini (1727<U+2013>1806), into his own employment, considered a coup in some of the Enlightenment circles.<ref>{{de icon}} J<U+00F6>rg Kreutz: ''Cosimo Alessandro Collini (1727<U+2013>1806).

London: Chapman and Hall, 1896<U+2013>1899, p. 193.</ref>  The French foreign minister, [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes]], who knew him, described Charles Theodore's foibles more forcefully:
:<blockquote>Although by nature intelligent, he [Charles Theodore] has never succeeded in ruling by himself; he has always been governed by his ministers or by his father-confessor or (for a time) by the [E]lectress [his wife]. This conduct has increased his natural weakness and apathy to such a degree that for a long time he has had no opinions save those inspired in him by his entourage. The void which this indolence has left in his soul is filled with the amusements of the hunt and of music and by secret liaisons, for which ''His Electoral Majesty'' has at all times had a particular penchant.<ref>J. C. Easton. "Charles Theodore of Bavaria and Count Rumford." ''The Journal of Modern History.'' Vol. 12, No. 2 (Jun., 1940), pp. 145<U+2013>160, pp. 145<U+2013>146 quoted.</ref></blockquote>
The Electress had provided him with a son, who had immediately died, but Charles Theodore's ''particular penchant'' for secret liaisons had produced several [[Legitimacy (law)|natural]] children. The Bavarian Electorate could not finance these offspring and their needs. Although Charles Theodore certainly wished to acquire more territory, he needed territory that he could bequeath through his [[Will (law)|testament]], rather than territory encumbered by a legal [[entailment]] that could only pass to a legitimate child.<ref>[[Henry Smith Williams]].

===Deal-maker===
[[File:LION JosephII.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Man with military jacket.|Archduke Joseph (pictured), the ambitious Habsburg neighbor, sought to strengthen his family's influence in German-speaking lands.]]
[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]], Archduke of Austria, King of the Romans, and co-ruler with his mother, [[Empress Maria Theresa]], coveted Bavaria. The lessons his mother had learned in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] had not been lost on him. The [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] sought a wider sphere of influence in the German-speaking parts of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>Robert A. Kann. ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526&ndash;1918.'' Berkley: University of California Press, 1974, ISBN 0520042069, Chapter III, particularly pp. 70&ndash;90, and Chapter IV, particularly pp. 156&ndash;169.</ref> Without this, the family could not count on the election of their chosen male candidate as Emperor, nor could the family count on an uncontested succession in the Habsburg territories of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. For most of Joseph's adult life, he sought to strengthen his family's influence in German-speaking lands. For him, this meant the acquisition of German lands, not lands in the eastern region of the Habsburg empire, even such strategic territories as [[Bukovina]].<ref name="BlanningGlory">[[T.C.W. Blanning|Timothy Blanning]]. ''Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648<U+2013>1815.'' New York: Viking, 2007. ISBN 978-0-670-06320-8, p. 591. See also Kann, p. 166.</ref>

Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, thinking he could claim the Bavarian Electorate for his offspring. After two years of unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to [[Lower Bavaria]] through a dubious and ancient grant made by the [[Emperor Sigismund]] to the [[House of Habsburg]] in 1425.<ref name="BlanningGlory"/> Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to the remainder of the duchy.<ref> Review of Harold Temperley. ''Frederick II and Joseph II. An Episode of War and Diplomacy in the Eighteenth Century.''  Sidney B. Fay. "Untitled Review." ''The American Historical Review''. Vol. 20, No. 4 (Jul., 1915), pp. 846<U+2013>848.</ref> Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and parts of [[Anterior Austria]] that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir presumptive, [[Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr<U+00FC>cken|Charles II August]], of the [[House of Palatinate-Birkenfeld|House of Palatinate-Zweibr<U+00FC>cken-Birkenfeld]].<ref> Blanning, ''Pursuit of Glory'', p. 591.

===Heir presumptive===
[[File:Charlesaugustzweibruecken.jpg|thumb|alt=Middle aged man, plump, wearing formal tie and white jacket, with military decorations.|Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr<U+00FC>cken (above), held great expectations, but needed the championship of either Prussia or France to secure the inheritance.]]
Unbeknownst to either Charles Theodore or Joseph, a widow&mdash;historians are uncertain ''which'' widow&mdash;opened secret negotiations with Prussia to secure the eventual succession of Charles August. Some historians maintain the active negotiator was Max Joseph's widow, [[Maria Anna Sophia of Saxony]]. Others assert it was not Max Joseph's widow but Max Joseph's sister, who was also Charles August's mother-in-law. This widow, [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria|Maria Antonia]] was the mother of the reigning Elector of Saxony. Ernest Henderson even maintained she was the "only manly one among the many Wittelsbach parties" involved in the issue.<ref> Ernest Flagg Henderson ''A Short History of Germany.'' New York: Macmillan, 1917, p. 214. Others argue it was the widow of Max Joseph's younger brother, but this brother had died in childhood. See Christopher Thomas Atkinson, ''A history of Germany, 1715-1815''. New York: Barnes and Noble, 1969 [1908], p. 313.</ref>

Charles August was no great admirer of Joseph's. As a younger man, he had sought the hand of Joseph's sister, [[Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria|Archduchess Maria Amalia]]. She had been quite content to take him, but Joseph and their mother insisted she marry instead the better connected [[Ferdinand, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]].<ref>Julia P. Gelardi. ''In Triumph's Wake: Royal Mothers, Tragic Daughters, and the Price They Paid.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2008, ISBN 978-0-312-37105-0, p. 183.</ref> After this disappointment, Charles August married [[Maria Amalia of Saxony (1757<U+2013>1831)|Maria Amalia of Saxony]] in 1774; she was the daughter of the Elector Christian (d. 1765) and his wife [[Maria Antonia Walpurgis of Bavaria|Maria Antonia]], Max Joseph's sister. In 1769, the reigning Elector, [[Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]], had married Charles August's sister. Charles August, sometimes called ''duc de Deux-Ponts'' (a French translation of Zweibr<U+00FC>cken, or two bridges), was a French [[client state|client]] and could theoretically draw on French support for his claim. However, he had especially good relations with the Saxon Electors: both his mother- and brother-in-law wanted to ensure that Maria Amalia's husband received his rightful inheritance.<ref>Berenger, pp. 96<U+2013>97.</ref>

==Diplomacy==
===Interested parties===
Prussia also expressed an interest in the disposition of the duchy. [[Count Karl-Wilhelm Finck von Finckenstein]], First Minister (or prime minister) for [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], believed that any Austrian acquisition in [[Bavaria]] would shift the balance of power in the Holy Roman Empire, diminishing Prussia's influence.<ref>Berenger, p. 96.</ref> Prussia's recent gains had been hard-won. Thirty years earlier, Frederick had engaged in protracted [[Silesian Wars|wars]] in [[Silesia]] and [[Bohemia]], resulting in Prussia's annexation of most of Silesia.  In the Silesian wars and the [[Seven Years War]], he had earned a new, if grudging, respect for his kingdom's military and diplomatic prowess from the European power-states of France, Russia, Britain and Austria.<ref>Hochedlinger, pp. 366<U+2013>367.</ref> To protect Prussia's status and territory, Finck and Frederick constructed an alliance with the [[Electorate of Saxony]], ostensibly to defend the rights of Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr<U+00FC>cken, Charles Theodore's heir presumptive. <ref name="Berenger96">Berenger, p. 96.</ref>

Although equally interested in maintaining its influence among the German states, France had a double problem. As a supporter of the rebellious British colonies in North America, it was in France's interest to avoid  a continental engagement. France could do more damage to the British in North America than in Europe.<ref name="Berenger96"/> The diplomatic realignment in 1756 had overthrown 200 years of French foreign policy that united the French Crown and the French populace against the House of Habsburg, arguably bringing to France massive territorial gains in repeated wars with Habsburg Austria and Habsburg Spain.<ref name=BlanningFRW>T.C.W. Blanning. ''The French Revolutionary Wars.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1996, ISBN 0340569115, pp. 22&ndash;23.</ref>  A reversal of this policy in 1756 tied French foreign policy in Europe to Vienna. Despite this restructuring, there existed in the French Court at Versailles, and in France generally, a strong anti-Austrian sentiment.<ref name="Berenger96"/> The  [[Diplomatic Revolution|diplomatic revolution]] of 1756, sealed in 1770 with the personal union (the diplomatic term for marriage) of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis]], the ''Dauphin of Viennois'', and the Austrian Archduchess [[Marie Antoinette]], was considered both a political and matrimonial  ''m<U+00E9>salliance'' in the eyes of many Frenchmen. It flew in the face of 200 years of French foreign policy, in which the central axiom "had been hostility to the House of Habsburg."<ref name=BlanningFRW/> Blanning, The French foreign minister, [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes]], maintained deep-seated hostility to the Austrians that pre-dated the alliance of 1756. He had not approved of the shift of France's traditional bonds, and considered the Austrians untrustworthy. He managed to extricate France from immediate military obligations to Austria by 1778.<ref name="Berenger96"/>

===Tensions rise===
In January 1778, tensions began to rise. On 3 January, a few days after Max Joseph's death, the ducal [[Equerry]] proclaimed Charles Theodore as Duke. Dragoons rode through the streets of Munich, some banging drums and some blowing trumpets, and others shouting, "Long Live our Elector Charles Theodore."<ref>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Robert Spaethling (ed.). ''Mozart's Letters, Mozart's Life.'' New York: Norton, 2000, ISBN 0393047199, p. 117.</ref> According to the 3 January agreement between Joseph and Charles Theodore, 15,000&nbsp;Austrian troops occupied [[Mindelheim]], ultimately more territory than had been granted to Joseph.  Charles Theodore, who had dreamed of rebuilding the [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian empire]], realized that Joseph was not seriously planning to exchange a portion of Bavaria, or even all of it, for the entirety of the Austrian Netherlands. At best, he might acquire a few portions of it, perhaps [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] or Gulders, [[Luxembourg]], [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]], or various dispersed possessions in Anterior Austria, most of which lay in southwestern Germany.<ref name="Hochedlinger367">Hochedlinger, pp. 366<U+2013>367.</ref>

While Charles Theodore's dream of a Burgundian renaissance receded, Joseph continued on his course to annex part of Bavaria. The widow&mdash;Max Joseph's widow or the mother-in-law or both&mdash;petitioned Prussia on behalf of Charles II August. Frederick's envoys to the heir presumptive convinced the slighted prince to lodge protests with the ''[[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Diet) in Regensburg.<ref>Robert Gutman.

==Action==
When it became clear that other monarchs of Europe were not going to acquiesce to a ''[[de facto]]'' partition of Bavaria, Joseph and his foreign minister, [[Count V<U+00E1>clav Anton<U+00ED>n of Kounic-Rietberg|Anton, Count von Kaunitz]], scoured the Habsburg realm for troops and concentrated 600&nbsp;guns and an 180,000<U+2013>190,000-man Austrian army in Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia. This army amounted to most of Austria's 200,000&nbsp;effectives, leaving much of the Habsburg border regions with the [[Ottoman Empire]] under-guarded.<ref>Blanning, ''Pursuit of Glory'', p. 608.

In April, Frederick and Joseph officially joined their armies in the field, and diplomatic negotiations ended.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 367.</ref>

===First skirmish===
In early July 1778, the Prussian General [[Johann Jakob von Wunsch]] (1717<U+2013>1788) crossed into Bohemia near the fortified town of [[N<U+00E1>chod]] with several hundred men. The local garrison, commanded by [[Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf|Friedrich Joseph, Freiherr (Baron) von Nauendorf]], a mere ''[[Rittmeister]]'' (Captain of Cavalry), included only 50&nbsp;[[Hussars]]. Despite the poor numerical odds, Nauendorf and his 50&nbsp;Hussars sallied out to engage Wunsch's men. When his small force encountered Wunsch's, which was more than triple its size, Nauendorf greeted the Prussians as friends; by the time the Prussians were close enough to realize the allegiance of the Hussars, Nauendorf and his small band had acquired the upper hand.<ref name=EbertNauendorf>{{de icon}} Jens-Florian Ebert.

===Invasion===
A few days after Wunsch's encounter with Nauendorf, Frederick and his 80,000&nbsp;troops entered Bohemia. They occupied N<U+00E1>chod, but advanced no further. The Habsburg army with its 600&nbsp;guns stood on the heights of the [[Elbe River]]. Joseph exercised nominal command, and [[Count Franz Moritz von Lacy]] held actual command.<ref>Carlyle, p. 203, maintained that Joseph's brother [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold]] was also there.</ref> Lacy had served under Marshal [[Leopold Josef Graf Daun|Daun]] during the [[Seven Years War]], and knew his military business. He established the Austrian army on the most defensible position available.

While the main Habsburg army faced Frederick at the Elbe, a smaller army under the command of [[Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon]] guarded the passes from [[Saxony]] and [[Lusatia]] into Bohemia. Laudon was another battle-hardened and cagey commander with extensive field experience, but even he could not cover the long frontier completely. Shortly after Frederick crossed into Bohemia, Prince Henry, a brilliant strategist in his own right, maneuvered around Laudon's troops and entered Bohemia at [[Hainspach]] ([[Ha<U+0148><U+0161>pach]], in [[Lipov<U+00E1> (D<U+011B><U+010D><U+00ED>n District)]], in the modern [[Czech Republic]]).<ref>Benians, p. 706.</ref> To avoid being flanked, Laudon withdrew across the [[Iser River]], but by mid-August, the main Austrian army was in danger of being outflanked by Henry on its left wing. At its center and right, it faced a well-disciplined army commanded by Frederick, arguably the best general of the age.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 368.</ref>

While his main army was entrenched on the heights above the Elbe, Joseph encouraged raids against the Prussian troops. On 7 August 1778, with two squadrons of his regiment, the intrepid "rookie", now ''Major'' Nauendorf, led a raid against a Prussian convoy at [[Striegistal|Berbersdorf]] <!-- {{coord|51|01|N|13|11|E |display=inline}} -->in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]]. The surprised convoy surrendered and Nauendorf captured its officers, 110&nbsp;men, 476&nbsp;horses, 240&nbsp;wagons of flour, and 13&nbsp;transport wagons.<ref>{{de icon}} Ebert, "Nauendorf."</ref> This kind of action characterized the entire war. There were no major battles. The war consisted of a series of raids and counter-raids during which the opposing sides lived off the country-side and tried to deny each other access to supplies and fodder.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 368. Williams, p. 245.</ref> Soldiers later said they spent more time foraging for food than they did fighting.<ref>Dill, p. 52.</ref>

The armies remained in their encampments for the campaign season while men and horses ate all the provisions and forage within miles.<ref name=Hoch367>Hochedlinger, p. 367.</ref> Prince Henry wrote to his brother, suggesting they complete their operations by 22 August, at which time he estimated he would have exhausted local supplies of food for his men and fodder for his horses.<ref>Benians, p. 707.</ref> Frederick agreed. He laid plans to cross the Elbe and approach the Austrian force from the rear, but the more he examined the conditions of Joseph's entrenchments, the more he realized the campaign was already lost. Even if he and Henry executed simultaneous attacks on the K<U+00F6>niggr<U+00E4>tz heights, such a plan exposed Henry to a flanking attack from Laudon. A coordinated frontal and rear assault was also unlikely to succeed. If it did succeed, the Prussian losses would be unacceptable and would demolish his army's capacity to resist other invaders. From Frederick's perspective, the Russians and the Swedes were always ready to take advantage of any perceived Prussian weakness. The French also could not be trusted to keep their distance. For Frederick, it was a risk not worth taking. Despite this realization, the four armies<U+2014>two Austrian, two Prussian<U+2014>remained in place until September, eating as much of the country's resources as they could.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 367.</ref>

The battle-less war was not without incident and these may have lost no luster in the telling. One story from the war captured the imagination of the historical painter, [[Berhard Rohde]]. From their advantageous height by K<U+00F6>niggr<U+00E4>tz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On the same day that Frederick's doctors [[Bloodletting|bled]] him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound (see painting by Bernhard Rohde in the Infobox).<ref>Berlin Art Academy, "Friedrich der Gro<U+00DF>e und der Feldscher um 1793<U+2013>94, von Bernhard Rohde." ''Katalog der Akademieausstellung von 1795''. Berlin, 1795.</ref> In his less-than-complimentary history of Frederick the Great, the English historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795<U+2013>1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his finger at the man, as if to say, ''do not do that''. The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods. Some reports maintained the Croat actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.<ref>Carlyle, p. 204.</ref>

Nauendorf continued his raids, the soldiers foraged for food and dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by K<U+00F6>niggr<U+00E4>tz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, she was willing to send 50,000 troops to augment the Prussian force. Frederick started to withdraw portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and [[dragoons]] remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 367.</ref>

===Winter actions===
Appointed to be commander of the Austrian winter cordon, [[Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser]] ordered a small assault column under the command of Colonel Wilhelm Klebeck to attack the village of Dittersbach.<ref group=Note>Shortly afterward, Klebeck was elevated to the rank of Baron (Freiherr), and awarded the Knights Cross of the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]] (15 February 1779).

In another raid, in January 1779, Wurmser advanced into the County of [[Grafschaft Glatz|Glatz]] in five columns, two of which, commanded by Major General [[Franz Joseph, Count Kinsky]], surrounded [[Habelschwerdt]] on 17<U+2013>18 January. While one column secured the approach, the other, under the leadership of Colonel Pallavicini,<ref group=Note>This officer was probably Colonel, later Count, Carlo Pallavicini, of the [[Pallavicini|House of Pallavicini]], who had been in Habsburg service since the latter days of the Seven Years War.

On 3 March 1779, Nauendorf raided Berbersdorf again with a large force of infantry and hussars and captured the entire Prussian garrison. Following this action, Joseph awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (19 May 1779).<ref name="Ebertnauendorf">{{de icon}} Ebert, "Nauendorf."</ref>

In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265&nbsp;men were killed and four officers and 123&nbsp;men were wounded, but not fatally.

Despite its short duration, the war itself cost Prussia 33&nbsp;million [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florins]].<ref name="Church">So posits William Conant Church, in his anti-war essay: "Our Doctors in the Rebellion." ''The Galaxy'', volume 4. New York, W.C. & F.P. Church, Sheldon & Company, 1868<U+2013>78, p. 822. This amounts to approximately $10 million US dollars circa 1792, or $232 million in 2008 (in Consumer Price Index).</ref> For the Austrians, the cost was higher: 65&nbsp;million florins, for a state with an annual revenue of 50&nbsp;million florins.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 385. Robin Okey. ''The Habsburg Monarchy.'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 2001, ISBN 0423344763, p. 38.</ref> Joseph himself described war as "a horrible thing ... the ruin of many innocent people."<ref>Okey, p. 47.</ref>
===Change in warfare===
This also was the last European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a distance while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time<U+2014>six months<U+2014>the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and shortly after, in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], though, this six-month engagement seems mild.<ref>Hochedlinger, p.385.</ref> Yet, while historians often dismissed it as the last of the archaic mode of ''Ancien R<U+00E9>gime'' warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.<ref>Blanning, ''Pursuit of Glory.'' pp. 609<U+2013>625.</ref>

The war also reflected a new height in military spending, especially by the Habsburgs. After the Seven Years War, the size of the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311&nbsp;men in arms in 1761&nbsp;to 163,613&nbsp;in 1775. In preparing for a second summer's campaign, Joseph's army grew from  195,108&nbsp;effectives in the summer of 1778&nbsp;to 308,555&nbsp;men in arms in Spring 1779.<ref>Hochedlinger, p. 300.</ref> Habsburg military strength never dropped below 200,000&nbsp;effectives between 1779&nbsp;and 1792, when Austria entered the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Several times surged above 300,000 men in arms, responding to needs on the borders with the Ottoman Empire or the revolt in the Austrian Netherlands. The military also underwent a massive organizational overhaul.<ref>Hochedlinger, pp. 300 and 318<U+2013>326.</ref>

In the [[vernacular]], the Austrians called the war ''Zwetschgenrummel'' (Plum Fuss), and for the Prussians and Saxons, it was ''Kartoffelkrieg'' (Potato War). In the historiography of European warfare, historians almost always described the War of the Bavarian Succession "in dismissive or derisive terms [as] the apotheosis (or perhaps caricature) of old regime warfare," despite its grand name.<ref>Blanning, ''Pursuit of Glory.'' p. 590.</ref> Some historians have maintained that the focus on the consumption of the produce of the land gave the war its popular name: the Potato War. Others suggest that the two armies lobbed potatoes instead of cannonballs or mortars.<ref>See Benians, p. 707, Dill, p. 52, Henderson, p. 213, Simms, pp. 624<U+2013>625, and Williams, p. 245.</ref> A third theory maintains that the war acquired its popular name because it took place during the potato harvest.<ref>Berenger, pp. 104<U+2013>105.</ref>

===Resurgence of the problem===

The underlying problem was not solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make territorial deals, again with Charles Theodore, and again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], a deal similar to the one that had failed in 1778. This time it would be a straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition.<ref> Harold W. V. Temperley. ''Frederic the Great and Kaiser Joseph: an episode of war and diplomacy in the eighteenth century''. London: Duckworth, 1915, pp. vii<U+2013>viii.</ref> Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm.<ref>Blanning. ''The French Revolutionary Wars,'' Chapter II.</ref> Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the financial benefits of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.<ref>Emile Karafiol. "Untitled review." ''The Journal of Modern History''. Vol 40, No. 1 (March 1967), pp. 139<U+2013>140, p. 140 cited.</ref> Even if he had to give up the Austrian Netherlands, it meant "the barter of an indefensible strategic position and ... an economic liability for a great territorial and political gain, adjacent to the monarchy."<ref>Kann, p. 166.</ref> Again, Charles II August, Duke of Zweibr<U+00FC>cken, resented the possible loss of his Bavarian expectancy, and again, Frederick II offered aid. This time, no war developed, not even a ''Potato War''. Instead, Frederick resorted to pressure politics. He founded the ''[[F<U+00FC>rstenbund]],'' or the Union of Princes, comprising the influential princes of the northern German states, and these individuals jointly pressured Joseph to relinquish his ambitious plans. In 1799, the duchy passed to [[Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria|Maximilian IV Joseph]], brother of the Charles August, whose only child had died in 1784.<ref>Dill, pp. 56<U+2013>57.</ref>

==Long-term effect: the rise of German dualism==

Joseph understood the problems facing his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe, where the family had vast domains, the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories.<ref>Okey, p. 47.</ref> Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the Austrian position in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift the center of the Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands&mdash;Habsburg territories which lay furthest west&mdash;and [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]]&mdash;Habsburg territories which lay furthest east. It also made the reacquisition of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.<ref name="Berengerokay">Berenger, pp. 43<U+2013>47; Okey, pp. 37, 46.</ref>

By the late 1770s, Joseph also faced important diplomatic obstacles in consolidating Habsburg influence in central Europe. When the British had been Austria's allies, Austria could count on British support in its wars, but Britain was now allied with Prussia. In the [[Diplomatic Revolution|Diplomatic Revolution of 1756]], the French replaced the British as Austria's ally, but they were fickle, as Joseph discovered when Charles Gravier extricated [[Versailles]] from its obligations. Russia, which also had been an important Austrian ally for most of the Seven Years War, sought opportunities for expansion at the expense of its weak neighbors. In 1778, that meant [[Partitions of Poland|Poland]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], but Joseph fully understood the danger of appearing weak in Russia's eyes: Habsburg lands could be carved off easily by Catherine's diplomatic knife. Frederick of Prussia was the enemy throughout his reign, and indeed throughout his parents' before him; the Prussian state's emergence as a player on the European stage had occurred at Habsburg expense in the 1740s, with the loss of Silesia, and in the 1750s and 1760s, with the Seven Years War.<ref name="Berengerokay"/> Joseph sought to unify the different portions of his realm, not the German states as a whole, and to establish Habsburg hegemony in German-speaking central Europe beginning with the partition of Bavaria.<ref>Paul Bernard. ''Joseph II and Bavaria: Two Eighteenth Century Attempts at German Unification.'' The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1965.</ref>

The broad geographic outlines of European states changed rapidly in the last 50&nbsp;years of the century, with partitions of Poland and territorial exchanges through conquest and diplomacy. Rulers sought to centralize their control over their domains and create well-defined borders within which their writ was law.<ref>Bergenger, p. 47. Karafiol, pp. 139<U+2013>140.</ref> For Joseph, the acquisition of Bavaria, or at least parts of it, would link Habsburg territories in Bohemia with those in the Tyrol, and partially compensate Austria for its loss of Silesia. The Bavarian succession crisis provided Joseph with a viable opportunity to consolidate his influence in the Central European states, to bolster his financially strapped government with much-needed revenue, and to strengthen his army with German-speaking conscripts. For him, supremacy in the German states was worth a war.<ref> Karafiol, pp. 139<U+2013>140.</ref> For Frederick, the preservation of Charles August's inheritance was not worth a war. Frederick had had sufficient war in the first years of his reign, and in its last 20 years, he sought to preserve the ''[[status quo]]'', not to enter into risky adventures that might upset it. If he had to withdraw from engagement with Joseph's army, such a sacrifice was a temporary measure. Warfare was only one means of diplomacy, and he could employ others in this contest with Austria.<ref>Fay, p. 847.</ref> The Austro-Prussian [[German dualism|dualism]] that dominated the next century's [[German unification|unification movement]] rumbled ominously in the War of the Bavarian Succession.<ref>Christopher M. Clark. ''Iron Kingdom: the rise and downfall of Prussia, 1600<U+2013>1947.'' Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press, 2006. ISBN  0674023854, pp. 216<U+2013>217.
