Group member [[Mollie King]] explained to the [[Daily Star]] how the group came to record it instead:
{{cquote|We heard the song playing while at our record company and went into the office where James was talking to the head of the label. We said: 'We have to have that song!' Then we found out that Kelly Clarkson was fighting for it but he gave it to us. James is lovely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://una-healy.com/index.php?start_from=42&ucat=&archive=&subaction=&id=& |title=Una Healy Fans - Your source for all things Una Healy and The Saturdays! |accessdate=2009-12-08 |work=www.una-healy.com}}</ref>}} The song was also wanted by American pop rock artist [[P!nk]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/showbiz/showbiz-news/celebrity-interviews/2009/10/16/we-were-delighted-with-response-at-t-in-the-park-and-we-ll-be-back-says-the-saturdays-star-vanessa-white-86908-21751336/ |title=We were delighted with T In The Park response and we'll be back, says The Saturdays star Vanessa White - The Daily Record |accessdate=2009-11-08 |work=The Daily Record}}</ref> The track was co-written and produced by Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters, famed for their writing of [[Keri Hilson]]' single "[[Energy (Keri Hilson song)|Energy]]" and work with [[Jordin Sparks]].

==Music Video==
[[Image:Frankieisooover2.jpg|thumb|right|Frankie Sandford in the music video singing.]]
"Forever Is Over" was accompanied by a music video for its single release. The music video was shot on July 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=97675 |title=Forever Is Over//1st single from Wordshaker |accessdate=2009-12-09 |work=BuzzJack Music Forum}}</ref> The music video was directed by [[Trudy Bellinger]]. 

The music video takes on an urban theme to it and sees the girls in a house and around a city singing. The video involves no dance routines and ends with the girls leaving a nightclub. During [[Una Healy]]'s middle eight of the song the girls can be seen bathed in atmospheric blue lighting whilst wearing black outfits. Other scenes include [[Mollie King]] licking her thumb and smearing her heart-shaped tattoo saying 'Forever' as a metaphor for saying that "Forever Is Over". In another seen Una can be seen deleting the L from 'lover' to spell 'over' on her laptop, also as a metaphor to contrast with the song's title.

The single was also performed at various British music festivals and on various television shows as promotion during its release period. On September 12, "Forever Is Over" was played live for the first time at the ''Annual Freedom Festival'' held in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]].<ref name="GetaCD.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.getacd.org |title=The Saturdays - Forever Is Over performances |accessdate=2009-12-10 |work=GetaCD.org}}</ref> Later that month, on September 28 the group was interviewed on [[The Paul O'Grady Show]] where they performed "Forever Is Over" for the first time on live television.<ref name="GetaCD.org"/>
