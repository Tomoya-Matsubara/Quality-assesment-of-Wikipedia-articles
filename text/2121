The '''Queen Elizabeth Way''' ('''QEW'''), is a [[400-Series highway]] in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Ontario]] linking [[Toronto]] with the [[Niagara Peninsula]] and [[Buffalo, New York]]. The [[freeway]] begins at the [[Peace Bridge]] in [[Fort Erie, Ontario|Fort Erie]] and travels {{convert|139.1|km}} around the western shore of [[Lake Ontario]], ending at [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway&nbsp;427]]. The physical highway, however, continues as the [[Gardiner Expressway]] into [[downtown Toronto]]. The QEW is one of Ontario's busiest highways, with an average of close to 200,000 vehicles per day on some sections. Major highway junctions are located at [[Ontario Highway 420|Highway&nbsp;420]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Ontario Highway 405|Highway&nbsp;405]] and [[Ontario Highway 406|Highway&nbsp;406]] in [[St. Catharines]], the [[Red Hill Valley Parkway]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway&nbsp;403]] and [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway&nbsp;407]] in [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], Highway&nbsp;403 at the [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]]<U+2013>[[Mississauga]] boundary and Highway&nbsp;427 in [[Etobicoke]]. Within the [[Regional Municipality of Halton]], the QEW is signed [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with Highway&nbsp;403.

The history of the QEW dates back to 1931, when work began to widen [[the Middle Road]] in a similar fashion to the nearby [[Ontario Highway 5|Dundas Highway]] and [[Lakeshore Road]] as a relief project during the [[Great Depression]]. Following the [[Ontario general election, 1934|1934 provincial election]], Ontario Minister of Highways [[Thomas McQuesten]] and his deputy minister [[Robert Melville Smith]] changed the design to be similar to the [[autobahn]]s of [[Germany]], dividing the opposite directions of travel and using [[grade-separated]] intersections known as interchanges at major crossroads. When it was initially opened to traffic in 1937, it was the first intercity divided highway in [[North America]] and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world. While not a true freeway at the time, it was gradually upgraded, widened and modernized throughout the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, more or less taking on its current form by 1975. Since then, various projects have continued to widen the route. In 1997, the provincial government turned over the responsibility for the section of the QEW between Highway&nbsp;427 and the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] to the City of Toronto. This section was subsequently renamed as part of the Gardiner Expressway.

In 1939, the royal couple toured Canada and the United States in part to bolster support for the [[United Kingdom]] in anticipation of war with [[Nazi Germany]], and also to mark George VI's coronation. The highway received its name to commemorate the visit; it was unveiled on June&nbsp;7 as the King and Queen drove across the Henley Creek bridge in St. Catharines. Originally, the entire length of the highway featured stylized light standards with the letters "''ER''", for ''Elizabeth Regina'', the Latin equivalent to "Queen Elizabeth". While mostly removed, they remain in place on three bridges along the route of the highway: in Mississauga over the [[Credit River]], in Oakville over [[Bronte Creek]], and in St. Catharines over [[Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek]]. A short section of Highway&nbsp;420 and its extension Falls Avenue in Niagara Falls also features these light standards.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=31<U+2013>34}}

The [[reassurance marker|markers]] identifying the QEW have always used blue lettering on a yellow background instead of the black-on-white scheme used on other provincial highway markers. They originally showed the highway's full name only in small letters, with the large script letters "ER" placed where the highway number is on other signs. In 1955, these were changed to the current design, with the lettering "QEW".{{sfn|Stamp|1987|p=9}}

A [[Queen Elizabeth Way Monument|monument]] was originally located in the [[Median strip|highway median]] at the Toronto terminus of the highway, dedicated to the 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the ''Lucky Lion''. Carved on-site under the direction of [[Frances Loring]] for [[Canadian dollar|C$]]12,000 (in 1940, ${{inflation|CA|12000|1940|fmt=c|r=-3}} adjusted for inflation). It consisted of a column with a crown at the top and a lion at the base. The monument was removed in 1972 in order to accommodate widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir [[Casimir Gzowski]] Park along Lake Ontario, on the east side of the Humber River.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=43<U+2013>46}}

Although the QEW has no posted highway number, it is considered to be part of the Province of Ontario's 400-series highway network.<ref>{{cite news

The QEW is a {{convert|139|km|abbr=on}} route that travels from the Peace Bridge&nbsp;<U+2013> which connects Fort Erie with Buffalo, [[New York]]&nbsp;<U+2013> to Toronto, the economic hub of the province. The freeway circles the western lakehead of Lake Ontario, cutting through Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville and Mississauga en route.<ref name="2010 mapart" /> A {{convert|22|km|abbr=on}} portion of the freeway is signed concurrently with [[Ontario Highway 403|Highway&nbsp;403]].<ref name="km" /> Unlike other provincial highways in Ontario, the QEW is directionally-signed using cities along the route as opposed to [[cardinal direction]]s. Driving towards Toronto, the route is signed as "QEW Toronto" throughout its length. In the opposing direction, it is signed as "QEW Hamilton", "QEW Niagara" and "QEW Fort Erie" depending on the location.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|p=9}}

The Queen Elizabeth Way begins at the foot of the Peace Bridge, which crosses the border with the United States and connects the QEW with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] in Buffalo, New York. A customs booth is located between the bridge and the freeway, where a toll is charged to Canada-bound drivers. From there access is provided to nearby [[Ontario Highway 3|Highway&nbsp;3]] and the [[Niagara Parkway]]. Through customs, the freeway proper begins, immediately curving northwest. Within the town of Fort Erie, interchanges provide access to and from the freeway at Central Avenue, Concession Road, Thompson Road, Gilmore Road and Bowen Road. While there is some urban development at the beginning of the freeway, the majority of the first {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} are located within lowland forests. Numerous creeks flow through these forests, often flooding them. The Willoughby Marsh Conservation Area lies southwest of the freeway approximately {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} south of Niagara Falls. After an interchange with Lyons Creek Road, the freeway curves northward.<ref name="2010 mapart">{{cite map

After crossing the [[Welland River (Ontario)|Welland River]], the original route of the [[First Welland Canal|Welland Canal]], the freeway exits the forests and enters agricultural land surrounding the suburbs of Niagara Falls, which the highway enters north of the McLeod Road interchange. Within the city, [[Ontario Highway 420|Highway&nbsp;420]] meets the QEW at a large [[stack interchange]], which replaced the former Lundy's Lane / [[Ontario Highway 20|Highway&nbsp;20]] interchange. Exiting the northern fringe of the city, the freeway curves northwest and begins to descend through the [[Niagara Escarpment]], a World Biosphere Reserve. [[Ontario Highway 405|Highway&nbsp;405]], also known as the General Brock Parkway, merges with the QEW along the short rural stretch between Niagara Falls and St. Catharines. While there is no Toronto-bound access, Niagara-bound drivers can follow Highway&nbsp;405 to [[Lewiston, New York]]. The QEW continues west into St. Catharines.<ref name="2010 mapart" />

[[File:Niagara-Escarpment-Winter-IMG 0626.JPG|left|thumb|The Queen Elizabeth Way travels between the [[Niagara Escarpment]] and [[Lake Ontario]] from [[St. Catharines]] to [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].]]
As the Queen Elizabeth Way enters St. Catharines, it ascends onto the [[Garden City Skyway]] to cross the [[Welland Canal]]. The {{convert|2.2|km|abbr=on}} structure replaced the [[lift bridge]] located south of it, one of two major bottlenecks prior to the early 1960s, and is one of two high-level ''skyways'' along the length of the route. As the QEW was the first long distance freeway in North America, several design restrictions were not considered and further expansion of the highway is inhibited by the proximity of properties throughout most of its length. Consequently, most of the route beyond the Welland Canal is sandwiched between [[service roads]] which provide access to and from the QEW as well as to local businesses and residences. After passing the Ontario Street (Regional Road&nbsp;42) interchange, the freeway crosses [[Martindale Pond]], which forms the mouth of [[Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek]]. West of the crossing is an interchange with Highway&nbsp;406, which travels south to [[Welland]], after which the QEW crosses out of St. Catharines and into the town of [[Lincoln, Ontario|Lincoln]] at Fifteen Mile Creek.<ref name="autogenerated715">{{cite map

Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels along the Lake Ontario shoreline through the [[Niagara Fruit Belt]]; numerous wineries line the south side of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road&nbsp;24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road&nbsp;18) provide access to the communities of [[Vineland, Ontario|Vineland]] and [[Beamsville, Ontario|Beamsville]], respectively. The latter encroaches upon the south side of the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters [[Grimsby]], where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three historic overpasses: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street and Christie Street, all served by a single [[diamond interchange]]. South of the [[50&nbsp;Point Conservation Area]], the freeway exits Niagara Region and enters the city of Hamilton.<ref>{{cite map

Within Hamilton, the highway passes almost entirely within an industrial park, with interchanges at 50&nbsp;Road, Fruitland Road and Centennial Parkway (formerly [[Ontario Highway 20|Highway&nbsp;20]]). The third is intertwined with the [[Red Hill Valley Parkway]] interchange, completed in 2009. From here, the freeway curves northwest onto Burlington Beach and begins to ascend the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway Bridge, the second high-level bridge along the route. As it crosses over the entrance to [[Hamilton Harbour]], the freeway enters the [[Regional Municipality of Halton]] and descends into the city of Burlington.<ref name="autogenerated715"/>

[[File:QEW into Mississauga.png|thumb|right|The Queen Elizabeth Way begins at Highway&nbsp;427 and immediately crosses into [[Mississauga]]. The Evans Avenue ramps and [[Etobicoke Creek]] crossing are visible here.]]
After descending into Burlington, the QEW crosses former Highway&nbsp;2 before it encounters the Freeman Interchange, opened in 1958 to allow construction of Highway&nbsp;403 and expanded in 1999 to accommodate Highway&nbsp;407. The freeway curves to the east, becoming concurrent with Highway&nbsp;403 through Burlington and Oakville. The two routes travel east straight though a commercial office area. [[Frontage road|Service roads]] reappear through this stretch to serve businesses fronting the highway. The segment between and includes [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s, opened in 2011, which required the construction of a second structure over [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Ontario)|Sixteen Mile Creek]]. In the eastern end of Oakville, the route curves northeast, passing the [[Oakville Assembly|Ford Motor Assembly Plant]]. Highway&nbsp;403 diverges and travels north as the QEW curves back to the east and enters Mississauga and [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]].<ref name="2010 mapart" />

Within Mississauga, the freeway encounters its narrowest [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]], sandwiched between residential subdivisions on either side that prevent further expansion of the busy route. It crosses the [[Credit River (Ontario)|Credit River Valley]], where a second structure is currently under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but like the previous section there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississagua / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway&nbsp;427 at a large sprawling interchange.<ref name="2010 mapart" /> The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]]; this section was [[Ontario highway transfers|downloaded]] from provincial to municipal ownership on April&nbsp;1, 1997, and became part of the Gardiner Expressway.<ref name="toronto download" />

The highway was designed to run along the lake shore, instead of [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lake Shore and Dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs.{{sfn|Shragge|Bagnato|1984|p=55}} Construction began on November 8, 1914, but dragged on throughout the [[World War I|ongoing war]].<ref name="filey 2011" /> It was formally opened on November 24, 1917,{{sfn|Emery|Ford|1967|pp=179<U+2013>182}} {{convert|5.5|m|abbr=on}} wide and nearly {{convert|64|km|abbr=on}} long.

It soon came time to name the new highway, and an upcoming visit by King [[George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] proved to be the focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June&nbsp;7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam at the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two [[Union Jack]]s to swing out, revealing a sign which read ''The Queen Elizabeth Way''.<ref name="royaltrip" />

However, the ceremony only designated the highway between St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. The remainder of the road was known by various names, including the ''Toronto<U+2013>Burlington/Hamilton Highway'' and ''The New Middle Road Highway''.<ref name="royaltrip">{{cite news

=== The New Niagara Falls Highway ===
McQuesten also foresaw the financial opportunities that came with cross-border tourism and opening the "Ontario frontier" to Americans. In 1937, construction began on a new dual highway along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment. This route was originally known as the New Niagara Falls Highway, but it was intended to connect with the Middle Road on the opposing shore of Lake Ontario.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|p=25}} Work began at the end of March to [[grading (engineering)|grade]] the route between [[Stoney Creek, Ontario|Stoney Creek]] and [[Jordan, Ontario|Jordan]].{{sfn|Stamp|1987|p=27}}

<!-- IMAGE LEFT -->
The prospect of removing hundreds of acres of farmland did not sit well with many, especially farmers in the path of the new highway. Rumours spread that the prices paid for land were to be well below market value, and local protests erupted throughout the summer. However, the purpose of the new highway was to replace the congested, winding and hilly route of [[Ontario Highway 8|Highway&nbsp;8]] along the escarpment; several groups of collisions that summer gradually persuaded the public in support of the new highway. By the autumn, {{convert|340|acres|ha|abbr=on}} of fruitland were cleared to make way for the route.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=25<U+2013>28}}

Over the next two years, numerous bridges and [[cloverleaf interchange]]s along the new highway were constructed. In addition, a large traffic circle was built in Stoney Creek to connect with Highway&nbsp;20. The majority of this structural work was completed before the royal visit in 1939. However, despite being opened to traffic between Stoney Creek and Jordan, the majority of the new route was gravelled. Over a ten week period in the late spring and early summer of 1940, {{convert|58|km|abbr=on}} were paved, completing the four lane highway between Hamilton and Niagara. On August&nbsp;23, 1940, McQuesten cut a ribbon at the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines and officially declared the Queen Elizabeth Way open between Toronto and Niagara Falls.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=33<U+2013>36}} Construction towards Fort Erie continued, but the ongoing war would delay its completion for some time. As an interim measure, the unpaved highway was opened during the summer of 1941. Two lanes of pavement were laid in 1946, but the four-lane highway was not fully paved until 1956. The completed QEW was officially opened on October&nbsp;14 of that year, completing the envisioned highway 25&nbsp;years after work had begun.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|p=49}}

=== Conversion to freeway ===
[[File:QEW from Mimico, February 3, 1958.png|thumb|right|Long traffic jams, such as this one entering Toronto prior to the construction of the [[Gardiner Expressway]], became commonplace on the unupgraded highway.]]

==== 1950s&nbsp;<U+2013> Control of access ====
Despite some modern infrastructure, including traffic circles, interchanges, and some grade-separations, the majority of the new superhighway was not controlled-access. This meant that existing farmers and homeowners along several segments that were once [[concession road]]s were permitted to build driveways and entrances onto the road. In addition, the majority of the crossroads encountered along the route were at-grade intersections. This combined with the ever-increasing number of automobiles, traffic jams, accidents and deteriorating pavement led the Department of Highways to report that it had begun "salvaging" the QEW in their 1953 annual report.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=50, 54}}

The first new interchange opened at Dixie Road in 1953, beginning a seven year program to make the Hamilton<U+2013>Toronto section into a full-fledged freeway.<ref>{{cite report

Over the next three years, the route was improved west to Highway&nbsp;10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. [[Service road]]s were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate along that section.<ref>{{cite news

Service roads allowed engineers to separate local access from the highway and avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=50, 54}} As such, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then [[Ontario Highway 25|Highway&nbsp;25]]), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then [[Ontario Highway 122|Highway&nbsp;122]]), Erin Mills Parkway, Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway&nbsp;10]]), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and [[Ontario Highway 27|Highway&nbsp;27]].

==== The Skyways ====
Two major projects were ongoing near Burlington at this point. On April&nbsp;29, 1952, the [[W.E.&nbsp;Fitzgerald]] struck the two lane [[lift-bridge]] at the entrance to Hamilton Harbour.<ref>{{cite news

The damaged crossing resulted in the closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed [[Chedoke Expressway]], construction began on the ''Freeman Diversion'', bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new [[Stack interchange|three-level stack]]. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=59<U+2013>61}}

[[File:Garden City Skyway, September 1963.png|thumb|right|The Garden City Skyway in September 1963, soon before opening. The old bridge lay to the left, raised for a passing ship. Traffic is queued on both sides, a frequent occurrence each summer until the skyway was built.]]
The Freeman Diversion opened to traffic in August 1958,<ref>{{cite book

with the old route becoming an eastward extension of Plains Road.<ref name="2010 mapart" />
The {{convert|2700|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} four-lane skyway was opened to traffic by Premier [[Leslie Frost]] two months later on October&nbsp;30. Although it greatly reduced traffic delays, it was not without controversy due to its height, cost, tolling, and most especially its name. Residents in Burlington demanded it be named the Burlington Skyway, while Hamilton residents countered with the Hamilton Skyway. As a compromise, the Thomas B. McQuesten Skyway was proposed. However, the provincial government had the final say in the matter, and opted to name it the Burlington Bay Skyway. Tolls were collected beginning on November&nbsp;10.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=59<U+2013>61}}

Elsewhere, in St. Catharines, planning was already advanced on a second skyway to cross the Welland Canal. The Homer Lift Bridge, a longstanding feature along Highway&nbsp;8, was another point where the QEW narrowed to two lanes and traffic faced regular delays. Construction of the Homer Skyway, as it was tentatively known, began in July 1960 and progressed over the following three years.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=59<U+2013>61}}{{sfn|Shragge|Bagnato|1984|p=81}} The $20 million (in 1963, ${{inflation|CA|20000000|1963|r=-6}} adjusted for inflation) structure was officially opened by Prime Minister [[John Robarts]] on November&nbsp;15, 1963.

The late 1960s and early 1970s also saw the complete reconstruction of three important interchanges: The Rainbow Bridge Approach (later Highway&nbsp;420) in Niagara Falls, Highway&nbsp;20 (Centennial Parkway) in Hamilton and Highway&nbsp;27 in Toronto. The former two were traffic circles in place since the QEW was opened in 1940. The third was a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of Highway&nbsp;27 to ten lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with the Rainbow Bridge Approach and with Highway&nbsp;27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway<U+2013>freeway traffic movements.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=50, 54}}{{sfn|Stamp|1987|p=56}}

[[File:427 and QEW reconstruction, 1967.png|thumb|right|The reconstruction of the QEW and [[Ontario Highway 427|Highway&nbsp;427]] interchange from a cloverleaf to a complicated stack took just one year in the late 1960s.]]
The junction with Highway&nbsp;27 was built over {{convert|48.5|ha|acre|0|abbr=on}} and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of {{convert|42|km|abbr=on}} of two-lane roadway.

[[File:Freeman Interchange.JPG|thumb|left|The Freeman Interchange in Burlington]]

==== 1980s to 1997 - Growing capacity ====
Now functioning as a freeway, the QEW was already overburdened by the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The Burlington Bay Skyway, the lone four-lane link on the route between Hamilton and Toronto, was initially designed to handle 50,000 vehicles daily, but by 1973 there were 60,000 vehicles crossing it. Planning for a second parallel structure began a decade later in 1983.{{sfn|Shragge|Bagnato|1984|p=83}} In July of that year, Transportation Minister [[James Snow]] broke ground for the new bridge.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=61<U+2013>62}} Construction was carried out over two years, and the twinned structure was opened on October&nbsp;11, 1985.<ref name="Hamilton facts" /> It was christened as the James N. Allan Skyway, in honour of [[James Allan (politician)|James Allan]], Minister of Highways during construction of the original skyway. The new name was not well received by locals, and debate erupted once again whilst the original bridge was closed and repaired for several years.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=61<U+2013>62}} It reopened on August&nbsp;22, 1988,<ref name="Hamilton facts" /> with Toronto-bound traffic crossing the original bridge. The twin structure was renamed the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, though it is commonly referred to as simply the Burlington Skyway.{{sfn|Stamp|1987|pp=61<U+2013>62}}

Alongside the twinning of the skyway, the QEW was widened to eight lanes between [[Burlington Street]] in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway&nbsp;2) in Burlington, and to six lanes north to the Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, [[changeable message sign]]s and traffic cameras were added to create a new [[Freeway Traffic Management System|traffic-management system called COMPASS]]. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built at the same time to relieve traffic on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.<ref>{{cite report
