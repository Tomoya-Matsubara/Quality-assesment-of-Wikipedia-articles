The '''Union process''' is an above ground [[shale oil extraction]]  technology for production of [[shale oil]], a type of [[synthetic crude]] oil. The process uses a vertical retort where heating causes decomposition of [[oil shale]] into shale oil, [[oil shale gas]] and spent residue. The particularity of this process is that oil shale in the retort moved countercurrent from the bottom upward to the top by a mechanism known as a rock pump.  The process technology was invented by the American oil company [[Unocal Corporation]] in late 1940s and was developed through several decades.  The largest oil shale retort ever built was the Union B type retort.

==History==
Union Oil Company of California (Unocal) started its oil shale activities in 1920s.  In 1921, it acquired a oil shale tract in the [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute Creek]] area of [[Colorado]], southern [[Piceance Basin]].<ref name=BLM2008appendix>

==Process==
The Union process can be operated in two different combustion modes, which are direct and indirect.<ref name=fossilenergy/>  The Union A (direct) process is similar to the gas combustion retort technology, classified as an internal combustion method, while the Union B (indirect) process is classified as an externally generated hot gas method.<ref name=assessment/><ref name=AICHE>

The Union retort is a vertical shaft retort.  The main difference compared with typical vertical shaft retorts is that crushed s oil shale in size of {{convert|3.2|to|50.8|mm|in}} is fed through the bottom of the retort and it moves upwards through the retort by the solids pump (known as as a "rock pump").  Hot gases, generated by internal combustion or circulated through the top of the retort, decompose the oil shale while descending.<ref name=assessment/>  The pyrolysis occurs at the temperature of {{convert|510|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} to {{convert|540|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}}.<ref name=BLM2008appendix/>  Shale oil vapors and gases are carried out from the retort at the bottom. Part of the gases is recirculated for pyrolysis and fueling combustion, while other part could be used as product gas. The spent shale is removed from the top of the retort. After cooling in a water it is conveyed to the waste disposal.<ref name=assessment/>

==Advantages==
The Union retort design has several advantages. The reducing atmosphere in the retort allows the removal of sulfur and nitrogen compounds through the formation of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[ammonia]].  Oil vapors are cooled by the raw oil, thus minimizing polymer formation among the hydrocarbon fractions.<ref name=BLM2008appendix/>
