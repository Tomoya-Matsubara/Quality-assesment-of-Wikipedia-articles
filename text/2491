'''''I<U+00E9>na''''' was a [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] of the [[French Navy]]. The ship's [[keel]] was laid in 1898 and she was completed four years later. Her design was derived from the preceding {{sclass|Charlemagne|battleship}}s with a heavier secondary [[Artillery battery|battery]] and thicker armour. She retained the [[tumblehome]] characteristic of all large French warships of this period that caused stability issues. Upon completion ''Iena'' was assigned to the [[Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean (France)|Mediterranean Squadron]] and remained there for the duration of her career. She participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers and made many visits to French ports in the Mediterranean.

While docked for repairs, ''I<U+00E9>na'' was gutted on 12 March 1907 by a [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] explosion caused by the decomposition of well-aged "Powder B" propellant. While it was possible to repair her, the ship was not thought worth the time or expense. Her [[hulk (ship)|hulk]] was used as a gunnery target before it was sold for scrap in 1912.

==Design==
''I<U+00E9>na'' was designed at the request of the Board of Construction ({{lang-fr|Conseil des travaux}}) to follow the ''Charlemagne'' class ships whose seakeeping qualities were not entirely satisfactory. But Constructor Thibaudier just modified the ''Charlemagne''{{'}}s design with a heavier secondary battery and thicker armour, distributed in a slightly different manner. This increased her displacement by {{convert|700|t|LT}} in comparison to the older ships and she retained the pronounced tumblehome that was the cause of the stability problems.<ref name=c1>Caresse, p. 121</ref>

===General characteristics===
The ''I<U+00E9>na'' was longer than her predecessors, at {{convert|122.35|m|ftin}} [[length overall|overall]]. She had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|20.83|m|ftin}} and, at [[deep load]], a [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|7.45|m|ftin}} forward and {{convert|8.45|m|ft}} aft. She was only slightly heavier than the ''Charlemagne'' class and displaced {{convert|11688|MT|LT}} normally, and {{convert|12105|MT|LT|-1}} at full load, 700 metric tons more than the earlier ships.<ref name=c1/>

''I<U+00E9>na'' was fitted with large [[bilge keels]], but was reported to roll considerably and pitch heavily,<ref name=c96>Gardiner, p. 296</ref> although this is contradicted by the ship's captain's report of November 1905: "From the sea-keeping point of view the ''I<U+00E9>na'' is an excellent ship. Pitching and rolling movements are gentle and the ship rides the waves well."<ref>Caresse, p. 127</ref>

===Propulsion===
''I<U+00E9>na'' used three [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]] built by Les Forges et Chantiers de la M<U+00E9>diterran<U+00E9>e, one engine per shaft. Each shaft drove a three-bladed [[propeller]] that was {{convert|4.5|m|ftin}} in diameter on the wing shafts and {{convert|4.4|m|ftin}} in diameter on the center shaft. The engines were powered by twenty Belleville [[water-tube boiler]]s at a working pressure of {{convert|18|kg/cm2|kPa psi|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The engines were rated at a total of {{convert|16500|ihp|lk=on}} and produced {{convert|16590|ihp|abbr=on}} during the ship's [[sea trial]]s. ''Iena'' reached a top speed of {{convert|18.11|knots|lk=in}} on her trials. She carried a maximum of {{convert|1165|t|LT}} of coal which allowed her to steam for {{convert|4500|nmi|lk=on}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship's 80-[[volt]] electrical power was provided by 600-[[ampere]] and 1200-ampere [[dynamo]]s.<ref name=c1/>

===Armament===
Like the ''Charlemagne'' class which preceded her, ''I<U+00E9>na'' carried her main armament of four {{convert|305|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}, 40-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[Canon de 305 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893/96 gun]]s in two twin-[[gun turret]]s, one each fore and aft.  The guns fired {{convert|340|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectiles at the rate of 1 round per minute at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|780|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}. This gave a range of {{convert|12000|m|yd}} at the maximum elevation of 15<U+00B0>. The magazines stored 180 shells per gun, enough for three hours of fighting.<ref name=c1/>

The ship's secondary armament consisted of eight 45-calibre [[Canon de 164 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893]] guns, which were mounted in individual [[casemate]]s. The guns fired {{convert|164.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}, {{convert|52|kg|lb|adj=on}} shells at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|865|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum range of {{convert|9000|m|yd}}. A total of 1606 rounds were carried, enough for three hours of fighting at the practical 1<U+2013>2 rounds per minute per gun. ''I<U+00E9>na'' also carried eight {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, 45-calibre [[Canon de 100 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1893 gun]]s in [[gun shield|shielded]] mounts on the shelter deck. These guns fired a {{convert|12|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectile at {{convert|710|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}, which could be trained up to 20<U+00B0> for a maximum range of {{convert|9500|m|yd}}. Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was six rounds per minute, but only three rounds per minute could be sustained. 2074 shells were carried to ensure three hours of fire. The guns were {{convert|6.26|m|ftin}} above the waterline.<ref name=c1/> 

''Iena''{{'}}s anti-[[torpedo boat]] defences consisted of 16 {{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on}} 40-calibre [[QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss|Canon de 47 mm Mod<U+00E8>le 1885 Hotchkiss guns]], fitted in platforms on both masts and on the superstructure. They fired a {{convert|1.49|kg|lb|adj=on}} projectile at {{convert|610|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} to a maximum range of {{convert|4000|m|yd}}. Their theoretical maximum rate of fire was fifteen rounds per minute, but only seven rounds per minute sustained. 15,000 shells were kept in the magazines.<ref name=c2>Caresse, pp. 121<U+2013>22</ref> Admiral Marquis criticized the arrangements for the 47&nbsp;mm guns in a 1903 report:

<blockquote>The number of ready-use rounds in insufficient and the hoists are desperately slow. The 47&nbsp;mm guns, much more so than the large and medium-calibre guns, will have to fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible.<ref>Caresse, p. 126</ref></blockquote>

''Iena'' mounted four {{convert|450|mm|in|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s. Two tubes were submerged and the other two were above the waterline. Twelve Mod<U+00E8>le 1889 torpedoes were carried, of which four were training models.<ref name=c2/>

===Armour===
''I<U+00E9>na'' had a complete waterline armour belt of [[Harvey armor|Harvey armour]] that was {{convert|2.4|m|ftin}} high and tapered from the maximum thickness of {{convert|320|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} that covered {{convert|84|m|ftin}} amidships to {{convert|230|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} at the ship's ends. The lower edge of this belt was a uniform {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness. The upper armour belt was in two [[strake]]s, the lower 120&nbsp;mm thick and the upper {{convert|80|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Their combined height was {{convert|2|m|ftin}} amidships. The maximum thickness of the armoured deck was 80&nbsp;mm and the fore and aft armoured transverse bulkheads were {{convert|90|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The main turret armour ranged from {{convert|278|<U+2013>|318|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} in thickness with a {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} roof and the ammunition shafts were protected by {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of armour. The casemates for the 164&nbsp;mm guns were 90&nbsp;mm thick and their ammunition tubes had {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of armour.<ref name=c1/><ref name=c96/>

The [[conning tower]] face had {{convert|298|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of armour and its sides were 250&nbsp;mm thick. Its roof was protected by two layers of armour, each {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The communications tube was protected by 200&nbsp;mm of armour.<ref name=c2/>

==History==
[[Image:Iena Bougault.jpg|thumb|left|A postcard of ''Iena'' at speed in a calm sea]]
''I<U+00E9>na'' was laid down at [[Brest, France|Brest]] on 15 January 1898<ref name=c96/> after being authorized on 3 April 1897. She was launched on 1 September 1898, but did not enter service until 14 April 1902.<ref>Caresse, p. 122<U+2013>23</ref> ''I<U+00E9>na'' was assigned to the Second Division of the Mediterranean Squadron and sailed for [[Toulon]] five days later. Enroute, the ship suffered from a number of problems with her rudder and had to be docked for repairs once she arrived at her destination. After the completion of the repairs the ship began a series of port visits in France and [[French North Africa]] which would be repeated for most of her career.<ref>Caresse, p. 125</ref> ''Iena'' participated in the [[fleet review]] off [[Naples]] in April<U+2013>May 1904 on the occasion of the visit of the [[President of France]] with King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]]. Afterwards, the Mediterranean Squadron cruised the [[Levant]], calling in [[Beirut]], [[Suda Bay]], [[Smyrna]], [[Mytilene]], [[Salonika]] and [[Piraeus]]. In April 1906, she was dispatched to provide assistance to Naples after the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius#Eruptions in the 20th century|Mount Vesuvius]].<ref>Caresse, p. 128</ref>

===Loss===
On 4 March 1907 ''I<U+00E9>na'' was moved into dry dock No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo maintenance of her hull as well as inspection of her [[rudder]] shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35 a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of the ''I<U+00E9>na'' which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was in a dry dock it was initially impossible to flood the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Patrie|1903|2}}, which was moored nearby, fired a shell into the gate of the dry dock in an attempt to flood it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux (who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship) managed to open the sluice gates. The {{ship|French battleship|Suffren}}, moored in the No. 1 dock beside the ''I<U+00E9>na'', almost capsized under the strength of the blasts.<ref>Caresse, p. 130</ref>

The origin of the first explosion was traced to Powder B, a [[nitrocellulose]]-based propellant used in the ammunition, which tended to become unstable with age, and self-ignite.<ref>Caresse, p. 136</ref> It was estimated that the contents of the ship's magazines were comprised of approximately 80% of the suspect powder at the time of the accident. The explosion and loss of 120 lives, including two civilians killed by fragments in the suburb of Pont-Las, triggered a major scandal, dubbed "the gunpowder scandal" ({{lang-fr|l'affaire des poudres}}). As a result Gaston Thomson, the Navy Minister, was forced to resign.<ref>Caresse, pp. 132, 137</ref> A similar accident later caused the loss of the {{ship|French battleship|Libert<U+00E9>|1905|6}} in 1911.<ref name=c8>Caresse, p. 138</ref>

===Disposal===
The multiple explosions gutted the superstructure between the mainmast and the rear funnel and collapsed the superstructure surrounding the mainmast. The ship's side between Frames 74 and 84 was ripped open down to the lower edge of the armour belt and all the machinery in this area was destroyed. After it was estimated that it would take seven million francs and two years to fully repair the ''I<U+00E9>na'' it was decided to decommission the ship and use her as a target ship.<ref>Caresse, pp. 129, 134</ref> All useful equipment was removed and she was towed to a mooring off the [[Porquerolles|<U+00CE>le des Porquerolles]] where she was used as a target to test the effectiveness of the latest design of [[armour-piercing shell]]s beginning on 9 August 1909. After the completion of numerous tests, and with the ''I<U+00E9>na'' close to [[wikt:founder|foundering]], she was towed to deeper water. While under tow ''I<U+00E9>na'' capsized and sank on 2 December 1909. The rights to the wreck were sold and she was subsequently broken up and [[Marine salvage|salvaged]] between 1912 and 1927.<ref name=c8/>
