'''Ladies' Gaelic Football''' is the most prominent amateur team sport for women in [[Ireland]].  It is also increasing in popularity in other countries around the world, often by members of the [[Irish diaspora]].

==Play==
The game is very similar to the male form of [[Gaelic football]], where two teams of 15 players kick or punch a round ball towards goals at either end of a grass pitch.  There are two main competitions in this sport; the National League which is staged during the winter-spring months and is used as a warm-up to the All-Ireland Championship which is played during the summer.  The All-Ireland Final is played on the last Sunday in September or the first Sunday in October in [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]], where the winners receive the [[Brendan Martin Cup]]. The National League and Championship are organised by the [[Ladies' Gaelic Football Association]].

==Differences from men's football==
Although most of the rules of the game are parallel to those for men's Gaelic football, there are some differences. The main ones are:
* Players may pick the ball directly from the ground 
* All matches last 60 minutes: in the men's game, senior inter-county games last 70
* Goal kicks may be taken from the hand
* A countdown clock with siren is used if available: in the men's game, the referee decides the end of the game
* The game is less physical, with frees more likely to be given for what would be considered moderate tackles in the men's game
