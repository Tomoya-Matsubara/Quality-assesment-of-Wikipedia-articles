'''Akeley Wood School''' is a mixed [[Independent_school|independent]] [[Education in England#Secondary Education|secondary school]] and [[Sixth_form_college|sixth form]] near [[Buckingham]]. It is owned by [[Cognita]], an independent schools company chaired by [[Chris Woodhead]]. The school prides itself on a "very special family atmosphere"<ref name="http://www.akeleywoodschool.co.uk/">School's homepage introduction.</ref>, although the takeover by Cognita has been considered controversial in this aspect.

The school accommodates pupils aged 3-18 albeit not on the same site - stretching efforts across three separate schools; a junior, lower and senior. There are approximately 900 pupils across the sites.

==History==
Akeley Wood School was originally named Hillcrest School, and located in [[Frinton-on-Sea]]. Hillcrest School moved, avoiding the [[World War II|war]], to [[Wales]]; and, in [[1946]], to Akeley Wood, where it was renamed. In 1972 the school changed from a boy's [[Boarding School|boarding]] to a co-educational day school.

A junior division of the school was introduced, and in 1976 provision was also made for those pupils who wanted to remain at the school to take their Ordinary Levels (subsequently [[GCSEs]]). The school expanded in 1987 to accommodate a sixth form.

The school grew rapidly, requiring a new site, and in [[1988]] Wicken Park was purchased to run a junior school. In [[1998]] Charmandean was purchased and the lower school was taken off site.
