[[Image:Crowded cytosol.png|thumb|right|300px|The cytosol of cells is a crowded solution.]]
The '''cytosol''' or '''intracellular fluid''' is the liquid found inside [[cell (biology)|cells]]. In [[eukaryote]]s this liquid is separated from the contents of [[organelle]]s, such as the [[mitochondrial matrix]], by [[cell membrane]]s. The entire contents of a eukaryotic cell, minus the contents of the [[cell nucleus]], are referred to as the [[cytoplasm]]. In [[prokaryotes]], most of the chemical reactions of [[metabolism]] take place in the cytosol, while a few take place in membranes or in the [[periplasmic space]]. In [[eukaryote]]s, while many [[metabolic pathway]]s still occur in the cytosol, others are contained within organelles. 

The cytosol is a complex mixture of substances dissolved in water. Although water forms the large majority of the cytosol, its structure is not well understood and it is possible that the water in cells behaves differently from pure water. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the [[extracellular fluid]]; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as [[osmoregulation]] and [[cell signaling]].

In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the cytosol is contained within a network of pores that run through the [[protein filament]]s making up the [[cytoskeleton]]. The cytoskeleton controls the movement of structures through the cytosol, such as the transport of membrane [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s. The small size of these pores and the large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s dissolved in the cytosol can alter how molecules behave, through [[macromolecular crowding]].

==Definition==
In the early 20th century the sum total of the contents of the cell (the ''[[protoplasm]]'') were commonly classified into the contents of the nucleus (the ''[[nucleoplasm]]'') and the remainder of the cell contents, the ''[[cytoplasm]]''.<ref name=Wheatley>{{cite journal |author=Wheatley DN |title=Diffusion, perfusion and the exclusion principles in the structural and functional organization of the living cell: reappraisal of the properties of the 'ground substance' |journal=J.

The term ''cytosol'' was first introduced in 1965 by H.A. Lardy, and initially referred to the liquid that was produced by breaking cells apart and pelleting all the insoluble components by [[Ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifugation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clegg JS |title=Properties and metabolism of the aqueous cytoplasm and its boundaries |journal=Am.

==Composition==
Cytosol consists mostly of water, dissolved ions, small molecules, and large water-soluble molecules (such as proteins). The majority of these non-protein molecules have a [[molecular mass]] of less than 300&nbsp;[[Atomic mass unit|Da]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Goodacre R, Vaidyanathan S, Dunn WB, Harrigan GG, Kell DB |title=Metabolomics by numbers: acquiring and understanding global metabolite data |journal=Trends Biotechnol. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=245<U+2013>52 |year=2004 |month=May |pmid=15109811 |doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.03.007 |url=http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/roy.goodacre/learning/metabprof/Goodacre-TibTech2004.pdf}}</ref> This mixture of small molecules is extraordinarily complex, as the variety of molecules that are involved in metabolism (the [[metabolite]]s) is immense.

===Water===
Most of the cytosol is [[water]], which makes up about 70% of a typical cell by volume.<ref name=Luby-Phelps2000>{{cite journal |author=Luby-Phelps K |title=Cytoarchitecture and physical properties of cytoplasm: volume, viscosity, diffusion, intracellular surface area |journal=Int.

J. Physiol. |volume=246 |issue=2 Pt 2 |pages=R133<U+2013>51 |year=1984 |month=February |pmid=6364846 |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&pmid=6364846}}</ref>

Although water is known to be vital for life, the structure of this water in the cytosol is not well understood. This is mostly due to the fact that methods such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly-understood, due to the ability of water to form structures such as [[water cluster]]s through [[hydrogen bond]]s.<ref name=Wiggins/>

The classic view of water in cells is that about 5% of this water is strongly bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of [[solvation]], while the majority has the same structure as pure water.<ref name=Clegg1984/> This water of solvation is not active in [[osmosis]] and may have different solvent properties, so that some dissolved molecules are excluded, while others become concentrated.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Fulton AB |title=How crowded is the cytoplasm? |journal=Cell |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=345<U+2013>7 |year=1982 |month=September |pmid=6754085}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Garlid KD |title=The state of water in biological systems |journal=Int.

===Ions===
The concentrations of the other ions in cytosol are quite different from those in [[extracellular fluid]] and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than the outside of the cell.

In contrast to extracellular fluid, cytosol has a high concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions.<ref name=Lang>{{cite journal |author=Lang F |title=Mechanisms and significance of cell volume regulation |journal=J Am Coll Nutr |volume=26 |issue=5 Suppl |pages=613S<U+2013>623S |year=2007 |month=October |pmid=17921474 |url=http://www.jacn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17921474}}</ref> This difference in ion concentrations is critical for [[osmoregulation]], since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by [[osmosis]] - since the levels of [[macromolecule]]s inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the [[Na<U+207A>/K<U+207A>-ATPase]], potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative [[membrane potential]]. To balance this [[potential difference]], negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.<ref name=Lang/>

The low concentration of [[calcium]] in the cytosol allows this ion to function as a [[second messenger]] in [[calcium signaling]]. Here, a signal such as a [[hormone]] or an [[action potential]] opens calcium channels and either allow calcium to flood into the cell from outside, or release the ion from stores within organelles.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Berridge MJ |title=Elementary and global aspects of calcium signalling |journal=J. Physiol. (Lond.) |volume=499 ( Pt 2) |issue= |pages=291<U+2013>306 |year=1997 |month=March |pmid=9080360 |pmc=1159305 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9080360}}</ref> This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as [[calmodulin]] and [[protein kinase c]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kikkawa U, Kishimoto A, Nishizuka Y |title=The protein kinase C family: heterogeneity and its implications |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=58 |pages=31<U+2013>44 |year=1989 |pmid=2549852 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.58.070189.000335}}</ref>

===Proteins===
Protein molecules that do not bind to [[cell membrane]]s or the [[cytoskeleton]] will be dissolved in the cytosol. The amount of protein in cells is extremely high, and approaches 200 mg/ml, occupying about 20-30% of the volume of the cytosol.<ref name=Ellis>{{cite journal |author=Ellis RJ |title=Macromolecular crowding: obvious but underappreciated |journal=Trends Biochem. Sci. |volume=26 |issue=10 |pages=597<U+2013>604 |year=2001 |month=October |pmid=11590012}}</ref> However, measuring precisely how much protein is dissolved in cytosol in intact cells is difficult, since some proteins appear to be weakly-associated with membranes or organelles in whole cells and are released into solution upon cell lysis.<ref name=Clegg1984/> However, the idea that the majority of the proteins in cells are bound to structures to form a network called the [[microtrabecular lattice]] is now seen as unlikely.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Heuser J |title=Whatever happened to the 'microtrabecular concept'? |journal=Biol Cell |year=2002 |volume=94 |issue=9| pages=561<U+2013>96  |doi=10.1016/S0248-4900(02)00013-8}}</ref>

This high concentration of proteins in cytosol causes an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]], which is when the [[activity (chemistry)|effective concentration]] of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the [[reaction rate|rates]] and the position of [[chemical equilibrium]] of reactions in the cytosol.<ref name=Ellis/> It is particularly important in its ability to alter [[dissociation constant]]s by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form [[protein complex]]es, or when [[DNA-binding protein]]s bind to their targets in the [[genome]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zhou HX, Rivas G, Minton AP |title=Macromolecular crowding and confinement: biochemical, biophysical, and potential physiological consequences |journal=Annu Rev Biophys |volume=37 |issue= |pages=375<U+2013>97 |year=2008 |pmid=18573087 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125817}}</ref>

==Organization==
Although the components of the cytosol are not separated into regions by cell membranes, these components do not always mix randomly and several levels of organization can localize specific molecules to defined sites within the cytosol.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Norris V, den Blaauwen T, Cabin-Flaman A, ''et al'' |title=Functional taxonomy of bacterial hyperstructures |journal=Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=230<U+2013>53 |year=2007 |month=March |pmid=17347523 |pmc=1847379 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00035-06 |url=http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=17347523}}</ref>

===Protein complexes===
Proteins can associate to form [[protein complex]]es, these often contain a set of proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Srere PA |title=Complexes of sequential metabolic enzymes |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=56 |pages=89<U+2013>124 |year=1987 |pmid=2441660 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.56.070187.000513}}</ref> This organization can allow [[substrate channeling]], which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Perham RN |title=Swinging arms and swinging domains in multifunctional enzymes: catalytic machines for multistep reactions |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=69 |pages=961<U+2013>1004 |year=2000 |pmid=10966480 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.961}}</ref> Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient than it would be if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol or prevent the release of unstable intermediates.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Huang X, Holden HM, Raushel FM |title=Channeling of substrates and intermediates in enzyme-catalyzed reactions |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=70 |pages=149<U+2013>80 |year=2001 |pmid=11395405 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.149}}</ref> Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways have been shown to involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely-associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mowbray J, Moses V |title=The tentative identification in Escherichia coli of a multienzyme complex with glycolytic activity |journal=Eur. J. Biochem. |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=25<U+2013>36 |year=1976 |month=June |pmid=133800 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&sid=nlm:pubmed&issn=0014-2956&date=1976&volume=66&issue=1&spage=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Srivastava DK, Bernhard SA |title=Metabolite transfer via enzyme-enzyme complexes |journal=Science (journal) |volume=234 |issue=4780 |pages=1081<U+2013>6 |year=1986 |month=November |pmid=3775377}}</ref> Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.

==Protein compartments==
Some protein complexes contain a large central cavity that is isolated from the reminder of the cytosol. One example of such an enclosed compartment is the [[proteasome]].
