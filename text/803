'''State Route 20''' ('''SR&nbsp;20''') is a state route roughly in the shape of a [[Capital letter|capital]] [[J]] rotated ninety degrees to the left, which runs through portions of [[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd]], [[Bartow County, Georgia|Bartow]], [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]], [[Forsyth County, Georgia|Forsyth]], [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett]], [[Walton County, Georgia|Walton]], [[Rockdale County, Georgia|Rockdale]], [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton]], and [[Henry County, Georgia|Henry]] counties in northwestern and north-central [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Its [[counterclockwise]], or western terminus is at the [[Alabama]] state line in [[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd County]], and its [[clockwise]], or eastern terminus occurs at its intersection with [[U.S. Route 19 in Georgia|U.S. Route 19]]/[[U.S. Route 41 in Georgia|U.S. Route 41]] (US 19/US 41) and [[Georgia State Route 3|SR&nbsp;3]] in [[Hampton, Georgia|Hampton]] in [[Henry County, Georgia|Henry County]] at the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]].

==Route description==
From the Alabama state line, SR&nbsp;20 proceeds east through central [[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd County]] into the city of [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]], and is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 27 in Georgia|US 27]], [[Georgia State Route 1|SR&nbsp;1]], and [[Georgia State Route 53|SR&nbsp;53]] through downtown Rome.  The highway leaves Rome to the east [[concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with [[U.S. Route 411 in Georgia|US 411]], bisecting Floyd County, and crosses into and bisects [[Bartow County, Georgia|Bartow County]], still co-signed with US 411until just north of [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]] (US 41 is briefly concurrent near Cartersville as well), after which SR&nbsp;20 continues eastward on its own. The route intersects [[Interstate 75|I-75]] northeast of Cartersville, and continues to head east, passing [[Lake Allatoona]] to its north, and crossing into [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee County]].  SR&nbsp;20 heads east into central Cherokee County and through its county seat in [[Canton, Georgia|Canton]], and crosses [[Interstate 575|I-575]], before continuing east into [[Forsyth County, Georgia|Forsyth County]].  In central Forsyth County, the route dips southeast to pass to the south of [[Sawnee Mountain]] and heads through [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]], crossing [[U.S. Route 19|US 19]] and [[Georgia State Route 400|SR&nbsp;400]], and heading on into [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]], passing to the south of [[Lake Lanier]].  SR&nbsp;20 then turns south after intersecting I-985, crossing [[Interstate 85 in Georgia|I-85]] shortly thereafter. The road also has provides access to [[Georgia State Route 316|SR&nbsp;316]], leading to [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]].

[[Image:Overheads for state routes 20 and 140.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Overhead signage for SR&nbsp;20 and [[Georgia State Route 140|SR&nbsp;140]] in Canton]]
SR&nbsp;20 continues southward through [[Lawrenceville, Georgia|Lawrenceville]] and heads into [[Walton County, Georgia|Walton County]] and through [[Loganville, Georgia|Loganville]], paralleling the Gwinnett-Walton County line, before crossing into [[Rockdale County, Georgia|Rockdale County]] and meeting [[Interstate 20 in Georgia|I-20]] just south of [[Conyers, Georgia|Conyers]]. Likely to help alleviate driver confusion due to two identically-numbered highways meeting, the highway is usually referred to at this point as [[Georgia State Route 138|SR&nbsp;138]], with which it runs concurrent through Conyers. SR&nbsp;20 continues south and then southwest to the Henry County seat of [[McDonough, Georgia|McDonough]], where it briefly runs concurrent with [[Georgia State Route 81|SR&nbsp;81]]. SR&nbsp;81 departs to the west after the routes cross [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] at exit 218. The portion of SR&nbsp;20 between the western end of the SR&nbsp;81 concurrency and US 19/US 41, the route's clockwise/eastern terminus, has recently been widened from two lanes to four, including a new southern bypass of the city of [[Hampton, Georgia|Hampton]], and more controlled access at US 19/US 41. The primary purpose of the widening is to facilitate the flow of traffic to and from the [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] located near the highway's eastern terminus.<ref name="Google"/><ref name="GeoTRAQS"/>

===Traffic===
The [[Georgia Department of Transportation]] [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT) numbers for the year 2011 show a variety of daily averages across SR&nbsp;20.  The traffic load on the route starts at its lowest daily average load as the route starts into Floyd County, where numbers hover around 5,400 vehicles per day.  These averages increase rapidly as the route approaches Rome, going from around 12,000 vehicles to a peak of 38,000 vehicles in downtown Rome.  As SR&nbsp;20 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;27, the numbers decrease to an average of 32,000, and then decrease more rapidly to around 15,000 as SR&nbsp;20 heads east out of Rome.  The vehicle load stays in that area all the way through Floyd County and into Bartow County, as the route is the main west-to-east thoroughfare between Rome and Cartersville.  In Cartersville, where the route in concurrent with US&nbsp;41, the vehicle count reaches a zenith of just over 41,000, but then drops off sharply as the route heads into rural Cherokee County, dipping just below 10,000 before increasing again to near 24,000 vehicles per day as the route approaches I-575.  On the portion of the route that is concurrent with I-575, the route sees its maximum vehicle load of just over 54,000 vehicles, again dropping rapidly east of I-575, going from around 24,000 down to 11,000, and further down to around 10,000 as the Forsyth County line is reached.

Numbers start to creep up again as the Forysth county seat of Cumming approaches, going from 10,000 to over 22,000 vehicles, cresting at 37,000 vehicles south of Cumming, as the route feeds traffic onto US&nbsp;19/SR&nbsp;400 southbound into [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].  Averages stabilize around 20,000 vehicles per day as SR&nbsp;20 heads into Gwinnett County, briefly cresting again at over 41,000 vehicles around I-985, and dipping to around 30,000 vehicles around I-85.  South of Lawrenceville, numbers then start to decrease once more from around 22,000 down to 14,000 around Loganville, and dip down into average of just over 8,000 in rural Walton County.  Until the route reaches Conyers, average numbers see lows of 6,800 in Rockdale County, increasing again to just over 31,000 in and around Conyers and I-20.  Rapidly decreasing once more to around 7,600 vehicles per day in Newton and northern Henry counties, another high is reached in the vicinity of I-75 with just over 28,000 vehicles per day, before the route reaches its eastern terminus in Hampton with average traffic loads just over 12,000 vehicles per day.<ref name="GeoTRAQS"/>

==History==
The first portions of the roadway that are signed as SR&nbsp;20 today makes its appearance on Georgia state road maps in 1920, which show the portion of the route from the Alabama state line through Rome to Carterville signed as [[Georgia State Route 4|SR&nbsp;4]].  The section from Cartersville to Cumming running east across north Georgia is missing at the time.  The next extant portion was the section running southeast from Cumming to [[Buford, Georgia|Buford]], which appears to be unsigned in 1920, and the piece between Buford and Lawrenceville, which is signed as [[Georgia State Route 13|SR&nbsp;13]].  The entire remainder of the current route was not yet in existence in 1920.<ref name="1920 map"/>  In 1921, the section between Cumming and Buford is shown as being signed as [[Georgia State Route 68|SR&nbsp;68]]<ref name="1921 map"/>, and by 1929, the existing portion from the Alabama state line to Cartersville had been signed as SR&nbsp;20, co-signed with US&nbsp;41&nbsp;W.<ref name="1929 map"/>

By early in 1932, Georgia state road maps show a new graded, but unimproved {{convert|18.5|mi}} section signed as SR&nbsp;20 between [[Rydal, Georgia|Rydal]] in Bartow County, and Canton in Cherokee County, which corresponds to today's routing of [[Georgia State Route 140|SR&nbsp;140]] in the area, and which met SR&nbsp;20 at its intersection with today's SR&nbsp;108.  In addition, a shorter {{convert|10.2|mi}} portion of the route between Lawrenceville and Loganville also made its first appearenace.  The existing portion of the route between just west of Rome to Cartersville appears as having been finished with hard surface, and the SR&nbsp;13 section between Buford and Lawrenceville appeared in the same finished condition.<ref name="1932-01 map"/>

Just a month later, the {{convert|23.8|mi}} connection between Canton and Cumming is shown as graded but unimproved, and is signed as SR&nbsp;20.  The sections from Cumming through Buford and Lawrenceville to Loganville had also been re-signed as SR&nbsp;20<ref name="1932-02 map"/>, and by the middle of the year, the route had been extended yet again with the addition of the portion from Loganville to Conyers.  Motorists were now able to travel from the state line with Alabama to Loganville, using [[Georgia State Route 61|SR&nbsp;61]], which was co-signed as SR&nbsp;20 by October in 1934<ref name="1934-10 map"/>, to connect to Rydal in lieu of the still-missing portion between Cartersville and Canton.<ref name="1932-05 map"/>

Nearly two years later saw the next extension, taking the route to from Conyers to McDonough.<ref name="1934-03 map"/>  Outside of some small surface improvements east of Canton, the next significant change in the route was the appearance in early 1941 of the straight west-to-east {{convert|23.4|mi}} connection between north of Cartersville and Canton, which was initially signed as Route 20 Spur (between US&nbsp;41 and SR&nbsp;61) and [[Georgia State Route 113|SR&nbsp;113]],<ref name="1941-01 map"/>, and re-signed to be part of SR&nbsp;20 by 1943.<ref name="1943-01 map"/>  

By 1953, no additions to the signed route length had been made, but the roadway connecting McDonough with Hampton had been constructed.  In addition, surface conditions had been improved to feature hard surface for the entire length of the route, with the exception of portions between Cartersville and Canton, south of Loganville, and north of McDonough.<ref name="1953 map"/>  Also by 1953, the SR&nbsp;20&nbsp;Spur running south from the main route to Allatoona Dam had been constructed and was signed as SR&nbsp;294.  It was 1960 before this final piece of the route, between McDonough and Hampton, had been finished and designated as part of SR&nbsp;20.  The entirety of the route was now extant, and was covered by hard surface<ref name="1960-1961 map"/>

===July 27, 2003 Holt-Dixon Accident===
The road is known as the site of the July 27, 2003 wreck that killed 14-year-old Cobb County resident Sara Holt and injured her parents and several of their relatives. This incident took place between [[Sugar Hill, Georgia|Sugar Hill]] and [[Buford, Georgia|Buford]] and was caused by a commercial truck driver under the influence of drugs.<ref name="truck driver under influence">[http://www.dui1.com/DuiCaseLawDetail61022.htm Ellis v. State - Georgia DUI Lawyers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sara's death marked the tenth teenager killed in a road accident in [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]] in 2003.<ref name="10th teenager">[http://web.archive.org/web/20030812021513/www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/gwinnett/0703/29wreck.html ajc.com | Gwinnett | Truck driver to face charges in fatal wreck<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The accident occurred when Gary and Edith Holt and their daughter Sara were traveling to [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] with relatives Joseph and Pamela Dixon and their children. The truck driver, Courtney Ellis, crossed the center lane of the road and crashed head-on into the [[Ford Excursion]], driven by Joseph Dixon, in which the two families were riding. The Excursion careened off the road and struck a tree, flipping over, and Ellis' truck ran down a ravine. Mr. and Mrs. Dixon and their two children were airlifted to [[Grady Memorial Hospital]], while Mr. and Mrs. Holt were transported to [[Gwinnett Medical Center]]; Edith Holt was severely injured and was forced to recuperate at a private hospital.

In the months following the arrest and Ellis' trial, there was a great deal of increased interest in the training and disciplinary standards of truck drivers, and a "Sara's Law" was proposed by some as a means to punish truck drivers who speed or are caught with drugs.<ref name="Sara's Law">http://www.mdjonline.com/articles/2003/08/03/271/10111048.txt</ref> In August 2004, Ellis was convicted of two counts of vehicular homicide and two counts of serious injury by vehicle for his negligence. He filed an appeal with the courts to throw out certain evidence, but the case was dismissed and the charges stayed.
