'''Zbigniew "Bishop" Dolegiewicz''' (July 8, 1953 <U+2013> October 29, 2008) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] professional [[track and field]] athlete and coach who specialized in the [[shot put]] and the [[discus throw]].

A tall and muscular athlete, he won [[All-America]]n honours while at the [[University of Texas]] and was the [[1975 Summer Universiade|1975 World University]] champion in the shot put. A [[silver medal]] at the [[1975 Pan American Games]] was followed by his first Olympic appearance at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. He won a [[Commonwealth Games]] bronze on home turf in 1978 and also set a [[Canadian records in athletics|Canadian record]] of 20.83 m in the shot put that year.

He won a second Pan American medal in 1979 and began competing in the [[World's Strongest Man]] competition, highlighted by a fourth place finish in 1980. He represented Canada at the first [[World Championships in Athletics]] in 1983, competing in the qualifying stage, and finished eleventh in the shot put final at the [[1984 Olympic Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] <U+2013> the best finish by a Canadian at the time. He retired in 1985 and moved into coaching, training throwers at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] and [[Southern Utah University]].

A steroid user during much of his career, Dolegiewicz testified at the [[Dubin Inquiry]] in 1989, revealing that he had taken and distributed [[Dianabol]]. He sold the drug to [[Charlie Francis]] in 1981, who acquired it for his trainee [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] (the athlete whose failed test sparked the inquiry). Dolegiewicz also stated that he believed steroid use was so widespread in the throwing events that he could not name an individual who had not taken the drug. The comments to the governmental commission resulted in the loss of his Canadian shot record and his dismissal from his post at the University of Saskatchewan. He died in 2008 at the age of 55.

===Role in Dubin Inquiry===
The failed drug test of Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson at the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]] sparked a national outcry and an investigation was launched into drug use within the sport <U+2013> the [[Dubin Inquiry]]. Dolegiewicz testified as part of the governmental review. He admitted to distributing drugs and also his own personal usage, which spanned over a decade.<ref name=Star/> Speaking before the commission, he estimated that half of the throwers at college level used steroids and said that among his peers on the global stage he "would be hard-pressed to find the name of an individual who hasn't used steroids".<ref name=NYT/>

His revelations cost him both his coaching role at the University of Saskatchewan and his Canadian shot put record.<ref name=Sports/><ref name=Star/> Among his statements, he also said that he looked upon his past steroid use with regret, noting that he had suffered mentally and physically as a direct result. He used these experiences in order to warn the next generation of athletes of the dangers of drug use: "I give people the examples of individuals that I have known that have gotten sick from the use of steroids and I try to come across and give the kids the message, 'Look, you're going to pay the price at some point in time'".<ref name=Star/>

He began to have circulatory and heart problems and on October 29, 2008, he died in his sleep at the age of 55.<ref name=Star/> He was survived by his wife Anna Dolegiewicz <U+2013> a former student of his <U+2013> as well as his parents and a brother.<ref>[http://www.team75plus.com/18012 In memorial - Zbigniew Bishop Dolegiewicz].
