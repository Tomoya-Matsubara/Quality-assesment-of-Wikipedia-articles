'''James Proctor Knott''' (August 29, 1830 {{ndash}} June 18, 1911) was a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Kentucky]] and served as [[governor of Kentucky]] from 1883 to 1887. Born in Kentucky, he moved to [[Missouri]] in 1850 and began his political career there. He served as [[Missouri Attorney General]] from 1859 to 1861, when he resigned rather than swear an oath of allegiance to the federal government just prior to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. 

Knott was disbarred and briefly imprisoned for his refusal to take the oath of allegiance. He returned to Kentucky in 1863 and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing the a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of [[Duluth, Minnesota]]. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1871, instead making a failed bid for governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.

In 1883, Knott left Congress and made a successful run for governor. He secured major reforms in education, but was stymied in his pursuit of tax reform. After his term as governor, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1891. In 1892, he became a professor at [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]] and in 1894, helped organized the college's law school. He served as dean of the school until an illness forced him to retire in 1902. He died at his home in [[Lebanon, Kentucky]] on August 29, 1830.

==Early life==
J. Proctor Knott was born in [[Raywick, Kentucky|Raywick]], [[Marion County, Kentucky|Marion County]], [[Kentucky]] on August 29, 1830.<ref name=congbio>"J. Proctor Knott"</ref> He was the son of Joseph Percy and Maria (Irvine) Knott.<ref name=harrison522>Harrison, p. 522</ref> From an early age, he was tutored by his father and attended public school in Marion and [[Shelby County, Kentucky|Shelby]] counties.<ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor James Proctor Knott"</ref><ref name=powell66>Powell, p. 66</ref> In 1846, he began to study law.<ref name=powell66 /> In May 1850, he relocated to [[Memphis, Missouri]], where he was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] and commenced practice in 1851.<ref name=congbio /> He also served in the offices of the circuit court and [[county clerk|county]] clerks.<ref name=powell66 />

Knott married Mary E. Forman on November 17, 1852.<ref name=powell66 /> Forman died during the birth of the couple's first child in August 1853.<ref name=harrison522 /><ref name=powell66 /> On January 14, 1858, Knott married his cousin, Sarah R. McElroy.<ref name=harrison522 />

==Political career==
Knott's political career began in 1857 when he was elected to represent [[Scotland County, Missouri|Scotland County]] in the [[Missouri House of Representatives]].<ref name=powell66 /> He served as chair of the judiciary committee and conducted the [[impeachment]] hearings against judge Albert Jackson.<ref name=powell66 /> In August 1858, Knott resigned his seat in the legislature to accept [[Governor of Missouri|Governor]] [[Robert M. Stewart]]'s appointment to fill the unexpired term of Missouri's attorney general, [[Ephraim B. Ewing]].<ref name=powell66 /> In 1860, he was elected to a full term as attorney general.<ref name=harrison522 /> 

In January 1861, Missouri called a convention to determine whether it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and [[Secession in the United States|secede from the Union]].<ref name=powell66 /> Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists.<ref name=powell66 /> The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority.<ref name=powell66 /> Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government.<ref name=powell66 /> As a result of his refusal, he was [[Disbarment|disbarred]] from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.<ref name=powell66 />

===In the House of Representatives===
In 1863, Knott returned to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in [[Lebanon, Kentucky|Lebanon]].<ref name=congbio /> He was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in 1867.<ref name=congbio /> As a legislator, he opposed the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] agenda of the [[Radical Republican]]s and ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth]] amendments.<ref name=harrison522 /><ref name=dod31>Tapp in ''Decades of Dischord'', p. 33</ref> He was re-elected to a second term, but did not stand for re-election in 1870.<ref name=congbio />

Knott's most notable action as a legislator occurred near the end of his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to further their westward expansion.<ref name=harrison273>Harrison, p. 273</ref> Knott singled out the [[Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad]]'s proposed line from the [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin-Minnesota)|St. Croix River]] to [[Duluth, Minnesota]] to make his point.<ref name=harrison273 /> Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.<ref name=harrison273 />

Knott's speech, known as ''Duluth!'' or ''The Untold Delights of Duluth'', brought him national acclaim and copies of the speech were reprinted and sold.<ref name=harrison273 /> Residents of Duluth apparently were not offended by the speech, extending an offer for Knott to visit the city he had ridiculed; Knott accepted the offer in 1891.<ref name=harrison273 /> A rail car sorting yard outside of Duluth was named after Proctor Knott in 1890, and the town of "Proctorknott", now [[Proctor, Minnesota]], took its name from those yards and from Proctor Knott himself.

In 1871, Knott made an unsuccessful bid to become governor of Kentucky, losing the Democratic nomination to [[Preston Leslie]].<ref name=dod37>Tapp in ''Decades of Dischord'', p. 37</ref> He was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1875, serving four consecutive terms.<ref name=congbio /> He chaired the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] for the first three of these terms.<ref name=congbio /> In 1876, he was named one of the managers of [[impeachment]] proceedings against ex-[[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[William W. Belknap]].<ref name=congbio />

===As governor of Kentucky===
Knott was one of several candidates vying for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1883. Other prominent candidates included Congressman [[Thomas Laurens Jones]], former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon Bolivar Buckner]], Judge John S. Owsley, and [[List of mayors of Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville mayor]] [[Charles Donald Jacob]]. Balloting began on May 16, 1883, with Jones being the leading vote-getter, but unable to secure a [[majority]]. After four ballots, Jacob withdrew his name, and Knott moved into the lead. The following day, Owsley dropped out of the balloting, and Knott extended his lead. Though Buckner remained on the ballot, the race came down to Jones and Knott. Delegates from [[Owen County, Kentucky|Owen County]] switched to Knott, and other counties soon followed suit. Jones withdrew, and Knott was nominated unanimously.<ref name=dod213>Tapp in ''Decades of Dischord'', p. 213</ref> 

In the general election, Knott defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Thomas Z. Morrow by a margin of nearly 45,000 votes.<ref name=harrison522 /> During his term in office, Knott asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response was to create a board of equalization charged with making equitable assessments.<ref name=harrison522 /> They also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.<ref name=harrison522 />

Knott's most successful initiatives were in the area of education. The state established a teacher training school for [[African-American|blacks]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] and created a state teacher's organization.<ref name=nga /> The legislature also approved the construction of the [[Kentucky State Penitentiary]] at [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], a project for which Knott's predecessor, [[Luke P. Blackburn]] had laid the groundwork.<ref name=harrison522 /> Feuds continued to rage in Kentucky during Knott's term in office, including one that lasted several years in [[Rowan County, Kentucky|Rowan County]].<ref name=harrison522 /> Knott refused to acknowledge lawlessness as a problem, however, and eventually became known for the number of [[clemency|pardons]] he granted as governor.<ref name=harrison522 />

==Later life and death==
Following his term as governor, Knott continued his legal practice in Frankfort.<ref name=harrison522 /> He declined two separate appointments offered to him by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]].<ref name=nga /> The first was to become [[Governor of Hawaii|Territorial Governor of Hawai'i]] and the other was an appointment to the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].<ref name=nga /> Knott served as a special assistant to Kentucky's attorney general in 1887 and 1888, and in 1891, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention.<ref name=harrison522 /> 

Knott became a professor of [[civics]] and [[economics]] at [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]] in 1892.<ref name=congbio /> In 1894, Knott and Centre president William C. Young organized a law department at the college and Knott became the department's first dean.<ref name=powell66 /> An illness forced him to retire in 1902.<ref name=harrison522 /> He died in Lebanon on June 18, 1911 and was buried at the Ryder Cemetery in Lebanon.<ref name=congbio /> [[Knott County, Kentucky]] was formed in 1884 and named in his honor.<ref name=powell66 />
