'''Whitefield''' (pop. 23,284) is a town within the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]], in [[Greater Manchester]], England.<ref name="GM Gazetteer">{{citation |url=http://www.gmcro.co.uk/guides/gazette/gazframe.htm |title=A select gazetteer of local government areas, Greater Manchester County|publisher=[[Greater Manchester County Record Office]]|accessdate=2008-06-17|date=2003-07-31}}</ref> It lies on undulating ground in the [[Irwell Valley]], along the south side of the [[River Irwell]], {{convert|3|mi|km|1}} south-southeast of [[Bury]],  and {{convert|4.9|mi|km|1}} to the north-northwest of the city of [[Manchester]]. [[Prestwich]] and the [[M60 motorway]] lie to the south.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] a part of [[Lancashire]], Whitefield has been suggested as lying on the path of an ancient [[Roman road]] leading from [[Mamucium]] in the south to [[Bremetennacum]] in the north. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], Whitefield was a division of the [[Pilkington (ancient township)|township of Pilkington]], itself a part of the parish of [[Prestwich-cum-Oldham]], and [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]]. Pilkington and Whitefield have historic associations with the [[Earl of Derby|Earls of Derby]]. Farming was the main industry of this rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by [[hand-loom]] [[woollen]] weaving in the [[domestic system]].

The urbanisation and development of Whitefield largely coincided with the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The name Whitefield is thought to derive from the medieval [[bleachfield]]s used by [[Flemish people|Flemish]] settlers to whiten their woven fabrics, or else from the [[wheat]] crop once cultivated in the district. The construction of a major roads routed through the village facilitated Whitefield's expansion into a [[mill town]] during the mid-19th century. Whitefield was created a local government district in 1866, and was governed by a [[local board of health]] until 1894, when the area of the local board became an [[urban district]].<ref name="GM Gazetteer"/>

==History==
===Toponymy===
There are several theories for the origin of the placename, which are discussed in two local history publications. One, published in John Wilson's ''A History of Whitefield (1979)'', is that the name comes from the Flemish weavers who used to lay out their fabrics to bleach in the sun (a process known as tentering), although Wilson doubts this because he believes it to be chronologically inaccurate; another relies on the fact that historically Whitefield has been a farming community of open fields and that the name is a corruption of "Wheat-fields". A third is that the name refers to a field of white flowers, as evidenced by the existence of the area of Lily Hill Street.<ref name="Wilsonp1">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=1.}}</ref><ref>Holt (1962)</ref>

In ''Remains, Historical and Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancaster and Chester (1861)'', the [[Will (law)|will]] of a John Rhodes describes leaving ownership of land in ''Whitefield Moore'' in Pilkington, to his son.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chetham Society|1861|p=115.}}</ref>

===Early History===
In Elizabethan times the land which forms Whitefield was moorland and until the nineteenth century it existed as part of the Manor of Pilkington, which also included the districts of Ringley, Unsworth and Outwood.<ref name="Wilsonp1"/> The Pilkington family also had possession of the Manor of Bury but the death of Sir Thomas Pilkington, fighting for Richard III at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], led to Henry VII confiscating all their properties and giving them to Sir Thomas Stanley, whom he created [[Earl of Derby]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=2.}}</ref>

With their seat at [[Knowsley Hall]], the Earls of Derby were by and large absentee landlords who appointed agents to manage their interests in the area, unlike the [[Earl of Wilton|Earls of Wilton]] whose lands at [[Prestwich]] bordered the area and who oversaw events on their estate and dispensed charity from [[Heaton Hall]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=17.}}</ref>

Hamlets developed over the centuries at Besses o'th'Barn, Lily Hill, Four Lane Ends (now the junction around Moss Lane and Pinfold Lane<ref>{{Harvnb|Ordnance Survey|1848}}</ref>), Stand and Park Gate (now the junction around Park Lane and Pinfold Lane<ref>{{Harvnb|Ordnance Survey|1848}}</ref>) before being generalised into the area known as Whitefield.<ref name="Wilsonp1"/> The Besses o'th'Barn area was for some time known as Stone Pale and a small street of that name still exists.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=11.}}</ref>

==Governance==
[[Image:Whitefield town hall.jpg|thumb|right|The dilapidated former Whitefield Town Hall]]
Whitefield was in 1853 a part of the township of Pilkington, in the parish of [[Prestwich-cum-Oldham]].<ref name="Salfordhundredpilkington">{{Citation | title = Pilkington | url = http://www.mancuniensis.info/PilkingtonFP.htm | publisher = Salford Hundred | accessdate = 2008-12-16 }}</ref>  Whitefield gained a local board in 1866. Pilkington ceased to be a township in 1894 and at the same time part of the old boundary of Whitefield was absorbed by [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Farrer|Brownbill|1911|pp=88-92.}}</ref> and Whitefield became an [[urban district]], with two wards, in the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Lancashire]]. The cause of the boundary adjustment with Radcliffe was that the Whitefield sewage works, which lay between Hillock and Parr Lane, were in the wrong place to serve the Stand Lane area.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=52.}}</ref>

A town hall was established in 1933 with the purchase of the house previously known as Underley, along with three acres of surrounding land. Prior to this the council chambers had been on Elms Street.<ref name="Wilsonp62">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=62.}}</ref>

On 1 April 1974 Whitefield became an [[unparished area]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]], a local government district of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].

Localities within Whitefield include [[Besses o' th' Barn]], Chapel Field, Hillock, Lily Hill, Park Lane, Stand and Sunny Bank.<ref name="MancNBusMap"/><ref name="GM Gazetteer"/> 

Whitefield has some substantial areas which are not built upon, consisting principally of the lands owned by Whitefield Golf Club, Stand Golf Club and [[Philips Park, Whitefield|Philips Park]].

The area has three fair-sized housing estates which were originally created as council-owned properties: the Hillock Estate, Elms Estate and Victoria Estate. The Elms estate was constructed in the 1920s and 1930s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=61.}}</ref> whilst the Hillock estate was conceived in the 1950s as an "overspill" area, originally for 8,000 people rehoused from the areas of [[Bradford, Greater Manchester|Bradford]] and [[Beswick, Greater Manchester|Beswick]] in Manchester which were being cleared of housing stock at that time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=68.}}</ref> All three of the estates now include properties which have been bought from council ownership into private ownership under [[Right to buy|right-to-buy]] schemes, with the remainder now managed by Six Town Housing<!--www.sixtownhousing.org - citation do do-->, an arms-length management organisation (ALMO) set up by the Metropolitan Borough of Bury. 

The area also encompasses the affluent community of Ringley Road. In recent years there has been a fair amount of new building, particularly in that area, on [[infill]] sites and some residential development of [[brownfield]] sites more generally.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

===Population change===

==Economy==
In 1906 the following textile bleaching, dyeing and finishing businesses existed in Whitefield: John Brierley (at Spring Clough); W.E. Buckley & Co Ltd (Hollins Vale); R & A Chambers Ltd (Spring Waters); Thomas L Livesey Ltd (Hollins Vale); Mark Fletcher & Sons Ltd (Moss Lane Mills, having been founded in Little Lever in 1854<ref name="Wilsonp57">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=57.}}</ref>); William Hampson (Besses); Kilner Croft Dyeing Co Ltd (Unsworth); Whitefield Velvet & Cord Dyeing Co Ltd (Crow Oak Works); and Philip Worrall (Hollins Vale).<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|pp=52-53.}}</ref>

At the same time there were five cotton manufacturers in the area: J G Clayton and Nelson Greenhalgh & Co (both at Albert Mills, on what was then Workhouse Lane); Lord, Frears & Bro. (Whitefield New Mill); Francis Mather (Whitefield Mill); and Worthington & Co (Victoria Mills, Unsworth). There were also two smallware manuacturers in the area, being Prestwich Smallware Co (on Hardmans Green, Besses) and the Victoria Smallware Co on Narrow Lane.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=53.}}</ref> Also, at least two firms in the building trade: John Jackson & Son, builder and joiners, on Livesey Street; and F.M. & H. Nuttall, builders and stonemasons, who were on Moss Lane and later had their stoneyard adjoining the west side of Whitefield railway station.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=56.}}</ref>

Whitefield's proximity to the M60 orbital motorway and city of Manchester has ensured that there are many small businesses and trading estates located locally.  Whitefield has experienced several new commercial developments since the turn of the century, for example with the replacement of Elms shopping precinct by a new gym and several new outlets and with a new [[Morrisons]] supermarket built in 2008 on land previously occupied by a public house, the bus station and a former retail premises which had seen several uses.

There used to be sweet factory on Stanley Road - [[Halls]], then arguably most famous for their "Mentho-Lyptus" product, sometimes spelled Menthol Lyptus - and there still is a fairly large flooring company in the Radcliffe New Road area, otherwise it is now small businesses. There is a strong local community, but nearby Prestwich is where most shop.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

==Transport==
[[Image:Whitefield Metrolink Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Whitefield Metrolink station]] is on the Bury<U+2014>Victoria [[Manchester Metrolink]] line]] 
Public transport began some time in the early 19th century and in 1817 there were coach services being run through Whitefield between Manchester and Bury along Bury Old Road, which had been constructed in 1755<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=11.}}</ref>. However, Wilson speculates that these were probably mainly for freight and states that the Coach & Horses public house at Kirkhams was the coaching inn.<ref name="Wilsonp48">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=20.}}</ref>

Bur New Road - a turnpike road, taking an alternate route between Bury and Manchester - was constructed in 1827. Toll bars for this newly constructed road were built at [[Kersal|Kersal Bar]], Besses o'th' Barn, Stand Lane and Blackford Bridge<ref name="Wilson">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=21.}}</ref>

In the 1860s and 1870s transport between Whitefield and Manchester consisted of a four-horse bus running at hourly intervals, with local passenger stops at the Bay Horse Inn at Chapelfield and at the Church Inn in the centre of the town. The firm which operated this service was called Turner, after which Turner Street was named.<ref name="Wilsonp48">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=48.}}</ref>

The Bury, Oldham and Rochdale Tramways Company operated a service of trams pulled by a steam engine from 1883. These ran until the end of the century between Bury and Kersal Bar,<ref name="Wilsonp48"/> when they were replaced by electric trams leased by Salford Corporation between Bury and Manchester along both Bury Old Road and Bury New Road. The lease expired in 1926 and the trams between Whitefield and Manchester were then replaced by buses, also operated by Salford Corporation.<ref name="Wilsonp58">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=58.}}</ref>  In the same year, Bury Corporation provided buses to operate from Whitefield to Bury.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=59.}}</ref> A bus station, now demolished, was opened in 1931 just set back from the junction of Stanley Road and Bury New Road, behind the then Church Inn.<ref name="Wilsonp62"/>

In the 1920s the evening trams from Whitefield and Manchester had a letterbox fitted to their fronts, enabling letters to be posted at the tram stops in time to reach the last post collection at Manchester post sorting office.<ref name="Wilsonp58"/>

By 1905 electric trams were also running between Whitefield and Radcliffe along Radcliffe New Road.<ref name="Wilsonp48"/>

On 18 July 1872 the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] (L&YR) gained an Act of Parliament to construct a railway between Manchester and Bury, via [[Whitefield]] and [[Prestwich]].  This opened in 1879 with a new station, known as [[Whitefield Metrolink station|Whitefield railway station]].   The L&YR line was [[Third rail|electrified]] in 1916 for which a power station was constructed near the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal]] at nearby Clifton, with substations at [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]] and at [[Manchester Victoria station | Victoria Station, Manchester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wells|1995|pp=102-103.}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Marshall|1970|pp=170-173.}}</ref>  Electrification brought down the journey times between Manchester and Bury from 32 minutes to 24.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=60.}}</ref> The line is now used by the [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]], upon which services commenced on 6 April 1992.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1994|p=57.}}</ref>  A station at nearby [[Besses o'th' Barn Metrolink station|Besses o'th' Barn]] also serves the area, having been opened on 1 February 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Marshall|1970|p=55.}}</ref>

All public transport is supervised by the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive]].

==Religious Sites==
The Five Mile Act of 1665 had made it an offence punishable by transportation for more than five people to congregate for worship other than in the manner prescribed by the Church of England, and for any nonconformist to minister within five miles of any parish of which he had been a parson. The area of Stand was six miles from Manchester, from Bolton and from Bury, which made it a suitable point at which nonconformists could legally meet. The specific catalyst for the meetings appears to have been the ejection of Thomas Pike from the living of Radcliffe due to his Puritan leanings; though he went to Blackley, those who agreed with his leanings began to meet at Stand, most probably at Old Hall, the house of Thomas Sergeant. By 1672 a barn belonging to William Walker had been licensed for preaching and in 1693 the Rev Robert Easton, ejected Minister of Daresbury, near Warrington, became the first Minister of Stand Chapel. The building had been erected in that year on land obtained from the Trustees of Stand Grammar School and, indeed, the School was held in the chapel on weekdays.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|pp=5-8.}}</ref>

Whilst preaching the nonconformist position, Stand Chapel was not at this time Unitarian. The transition to Unitarianism was gradual, being completed in 1789 when the Rev R Aubrey determined to follow the doctrine (it was in fact illegal to call oneself a Unitarian until 1813). This doctrinal decision caused a split, with some of the congregation leaving to form Stand Independent Chapel on Stand Lane.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|pp=10.}}</ref> 

Stand Unitarian Chapel was demolished and another built, capable of seating 400, in 1818.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=28.}}</ref>

Stand All Saints [[Church of England|CofE]] Church, which was a so-called [[Waterloo church|'Waterloo Church']], having been built to celebrate Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,<ref> {{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|pp=25-26.}}</ref> is located just outside the town centre.  The site was given by the [[Earl of Derby]] and the first stone laid by the [[Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton|Earl of Wilton]] on 3 August 1822.  Consecrated on 8 September 1826 by [[Charles James Blomfield|Dr Blomfield]], Bishop of Chester, it was designed by [[Charles Barry|Sir Charles Barry]] in the Gothic style of the fourteenth century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=25.}}</ref>  The tower is {{convert|186|ft|m}} in height.<ref name="Salfordhundredpilkington"/>  The cost of the building was <U+00A3>14,987.<ref name="Salfordhundredpilkington"/> <ref>{{Harvnb|Butterworth|1841|p=114.}}</ref>  A clock was added to the tower in 1832 and then replaced in 1906.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=26.}}</ref> The church forms the centrepiece of the All Saints [[conservation area|conservation area]], designated by the local council in March 2004.<ref>{{Citation | title = Conservation Areas | url = http://www.bury.gov.uk/Environment/LandAndPremises/Conservation/ConservationAreas/default.htm | publisher = Bury Metropolitan Borough Council | accessdate = 2008-12-19 }}</ref>

Roman Catholics were of sufficient number by 1952 that they rented a room at the Liberal Club building, which was at that time on Morley Street; subsequently, in 1956, St Bernadette's Church was built on Manchester Road as their place of worship.<ref name="Wilsonp70">{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=70.}}</ref>  The building had cost <U+00A3>22,446 and the foundation stone had been laid on 26 March 1955; although the stone bears the name of Bishop H V Marshall it was in fact laid by the Vicar General, Monsignor J Cunningham, due to the illness of the former.<ref>{{Citation | title = St Bernadettes RC Church | url = http://saintbernadettes.org/History.html | publisher = St. Bernadette's | accessdate = 2008-12-20}}</ref>

Besses o'th' Barn Band, and subsequently its associated Boys' Band, has existed in the area since at least 1818, at which time it had converted from a string band to a reed band. Its founders were John, James and Joseph Clegg - three brothers who were manufacturers of cotton products at Besses o'th' Barn - and for this reason it was for a time known as Clegg's Reed Band.  Originally using a room called the mangle room, attached to the old barn at Besses which was pulled down in the 1880s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|p=24.}}</ref> it has had its headquarters on Moss Lane since 1884. At the peak of its fame in the early 1900s this Band, by now using brass instruments, undertook numerous prestigious engagements, including world tours lasting well in excess of 12 months at a time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wilson|1979|pp=54-55.}}</ref>
