The Maglalatik is a Indigenous dance from the Philippines in which  coconut shell halves that are secured onto the dancers' hands and on vests upon which are hung four or six more coconut shell halves.  The dancers - all male - perform the dance by hitting one coconut shell with the other - sometimes the ones on the hands, sometimes, the ones on the body, and sometimes the shells worn by another performer, all in time to a fast drumbeat.  Like many native Filipino dances, it is intended to impress the viewer with the great skill of the dancer, and in some [[Filipino Martial Arts]] (FMA) circles, it has been noted that the manlalatik "consists of a trapping and boxing method hidden in a dance."<ref>{{cite web

The name of the dance comes from the filipino word "Latik", which means "fried coconut milk curd", a coconut product that is used in filipino cooking, particularly in snacks.
