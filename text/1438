[[Image:Destiny's Child Tour.jpg|thumb|right|Destiny's Child performing their 2000 hit single, "[[Say My Name]]".]]
The group changed its name to Destiny's Child in 1993, based on a passage in the [[Book of Isaiah]].<ref name="Kaufman" /> Together, they performed in local events and, after four years on the road, the group was signed to [[Columbia Records]] in late 1997. That same year, Destiny's Child recorded their major label d<U+00E9>but song, "Killing Time", for the soundtrack to the 1997 film, ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.<ref name="Kaufman" /><ref name="J.R." /> The following year, the group released their [[Destiny's Child (album)|self-titled debut album]],<ref name="Farley" /> scoring their first major hit "[[No, No, No (Destiny's Child song)|No, No, No]]". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, amassing moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for "Best R&B/Soul Single" for "No, No, No", "Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year" and "Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist".<ref name="Kaufman" /> The group released their multi-platinum second album ''[[The Writing's on the Wall]]'' in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as "[[Bills, Bills, Bills]]", the group's first number-one single, "[[Jumpin' Jumpin']]", and "[[Say My Name]]", which became their most-successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. "Say My Name" won the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]] and the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[43rd Grammy Awards]].<ref name="Kaufman" /> ''The Writing's on the Wall'' sold more than eight million copies.<ref name="Farley" /> During this time, Knowles recorded a duet with [[Marc Nelson]] on the song "After All Is Said and Done" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, ''[[The Best Man (1999 film)|The Best Man]]''.

Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against the group for breach of contract. [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Farrah Franklin]] appeared on the video of "Say My Name", implying that Luckett and Roberson had already been replaced.<ref name="Kaufman" /> Eventually, Luckett and Roberson left the group. Franklin would eventually fade from the group after five months,<ref name="Farley" /> as evidenced by her absences during promotional appearances and concerts. She attributed her departure to negative vibes in the group resulting from the strife.<ref name="Kaufman" /> During this time, Knowles had experienced depression from an accumulation of struggles: the publicized split of Luckett and Roberson, being publicly attacked by the media, critics and blogs for causing the split-up,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/beyonce%20i%20was%20depressed%20at%2019_1088171 |title=Beyonce: "I was depressed at 19" |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=January 12, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref> and a longstanding boyfriend (that she had dated from age 12 to 19 years) leaving her.<ref name="Depression">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/13/entertainment/main2258069.shtml |title=Beyonce On Love, Depression and Reality |work=CBS News |date=December 13, 2006 |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/beyonce-speaks-about-her-past-depression_article_3131 |title=Beyonce Speaks About Her Past Depression |date=December 15, 2006 |work=[[Access Hollywood]] |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref> The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.

After settling on their final lineup, the trio recorded "[[Independent Women Part I]]", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film, ''[[Charlie's Angels (film)|Charlie's Angels]]''. It became their best-charting single, topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for eleven consecutive weeks.<ref name="Kaufman" /> Later that year, Luckett and Roberson withdrew their case against their now-former band mates, while maintaining the suit against Mathew, which ended in both sides agreeing to stop public disparaging.<ref name="Kaufman" /> In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Knowles landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, ''[[Carmen: A Hip Hopera]]'', starring alongside American actor [[Mekhi Phifer]].

Knowles' music is generally [[contemporary R&B]], but she also incorporates pop, [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[soul music|soul]] into her songs. While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Knowles recorded several Spanish records for ''[[Irreemplazable]]'' and the re-release of ''B'Day''. Prior to recording the Spanish titles on the album's re-release, Knowles was coached phonetically by American record producer, Rudy Perez.<ref name="Vineyard1">{{cite web|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: Behind The B'Day Videos 1 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/videos_07/news_feature_040207/index.jhtml |work=MTV News  |accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref>

Since Destiny's Child, Knowles has artistically been involved in her career.<ref name="Kaufman" /> She received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded by the group, as well as her solo efforts. Known for writing personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions, Knowles has stated that having [[Jay-Z]] in her life has changed a few of her thoughts about how men and women relate to one another, which helped her transition from writing songs such as "[[Independent Women]]" and "[[Survivor (Destiny's Child song)|Survivor]]" to man-tending anthems such as, "[[Cater 2 U]]" in which she sings about bringing him slippers and drawing his bath.<ref name="Vineyard">{{cite news|last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> Shoots Down Jay-Z Marriage Rumors In Vanity Fair Interview |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1510890/20051004/knowles_beyonce.jhtml |work=MTV News  |date=October 4, 2005 |accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Some of her songs are autobiographical, which she has admitted are taken from personal experiences, as well as her friends'.<ref name="CBS">{{cite news|title=Beyonc<U+00E9> Tries For Timeless |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/07/08/earlyshow/leisure/music/main562232.shtml |work=[[CBS News]] |date=July 9, 2003 |accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Knowles has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts.

Known for being sexy, seductive and provocative when performing on stage, Knowles has stated that's her [[alter ego]], Sasha Fierce.<ref name="Depression"/> She described Sasha as being "too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy", stating "I'm not like her in real life at all ... I'm not flirtatious and super-confident and fearless like her. What I feel onstage I don't feel anywhere else. It's an out-of-body experience. I created my stage persona to protect myself so that when I go home I don't have to think about what it is I do. Sasha isn't me. The people around me know who I really am."<ref name="Depression"/> Although Sasha was born during the making of her 2003 hit single, "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Crazy in Love]]", Knowles introduced her alter ego with the release of her third album, ''[[I Am... Sasha Fierce]]'' in 2008. In February 2010, Knowles announced in an interview with ''[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]'' magazine that "Sasha Fierce is done. I killed her". She then went on saying that she is comfortable enough with herself to be all of those things without an alias, stating "I don't need Sasha Fierce anymore, because I've grown and now I'm able to merge the two."<ref>{{cite web|last=Crosley |first=Hillary |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1632774/20100226/knowles_beyonce.jhtml |title=Beyonce Says She 'Killed' Sasha Fierce |work=MTV News  |date=February 26, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>
