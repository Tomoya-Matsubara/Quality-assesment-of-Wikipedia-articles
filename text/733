The '''Erie Gauge War''' (sometimes called the '''Erie Railroad War''') was a conflict between the citizens of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], and two railroad companies over the standardization of the [[rail gauge]] between Erie and the [[New York]] border. It started on December 7, 1853, and ended on February 1, 1854.

== Background ==
In 1849, the [[Erie and North East Railroad]] started laying track east from Erie to the New York&ndash;Pennsylvania border at a gauge of {{RailGauge|6|lk=on}}.<ref name="Erie">{{cite book |last=Wellejus |first=Edward |title=Erie: Chronicle of a Great Lakes City |isbn=0897810074 |publisher=Windsor Publications |location=[[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, CA]] |year=1980}}</ref> At the same time, the [[Franklin Canal Company]] was laying track west from Erie to the [[Ohio]]&ndash;Pennsylvania border and the [[Buffalo and State Line Railroad]] was laying track from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] to the New York border, both were at a gauge of {{RailGauge|ohio}} (Ohio gauge).<ref name="Erie"/> On November 23, 1852, the first train left Erie heading to [[Ashtabula, Ohio]], and on January 19, 1852, the first train from New York state arrived in Erie.<ref name="Erie"/><ref name="history RR">{{cite book |last=Reed |first=John Elmer |title=History of Erie County |publisher=Historical Publishing Company|location=[[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka, KS]] |year=1925 |oclc=2566729}}</ref> A passenger traveling from Buffalo to [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] would be forced to change trains at the Pennsylvania border because of the different gauges.<ref name="history">{{cite book |last=Rhodes |first=James Ford |authorlink=James Ford Rhodes |title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850 |year=1900 |publisher=[[Harper & Brothers]] |location=[[New York City|New York]]}}</ref> Twenty [[mile]]s (32 [[kilometre|km]]) down the road in Erie, the passenger would again have to change trains. The process of having to constantly change trains would result in lengthy delays, often causing passengers to miss connecting trains and be forced to stay in Erie. 

The citizens of Erie enjoyed being an "enforced stopping place"<ref name="Erie"/> as they made big profits from the transferring of freight from one train to another and from passengers<U+2032> having to buy food at Erie's restaurants or [[street vendor]]s (leading the conflict to sometimes be referred to as the "Peanut War"<ref name="penn">{{cite journal |last=Kent |first=Donald H. |date=October 1948 | journal=Pennsylvania History |title=The Erie War of the Gauges|accessdate=2008-04-24 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |format=[[PDF]] |location=[[Philadelphia]] |url=http://dpubs.libraries.psu.edu/DPubS?service=Repository&version=1.0&verb=Disseminate&view=body&content-type=pdf_1&handle=psu.ph/1143574160}}</ref> as Erie's peanut sellers would be the hardest hit by the lack of passengers). The owners of the Buffalo and State Line Railroad were able to acquire two-thirds  of the Erie and North East's [[stock]]<ref name="Erie"/> and on November 16, 1853, made the decision to re-lay the {{RailGauge|6}} track between Erie and the New York border as Ohio gauge<ref name="history"/> but, four months early, to try to prevent the change, Erie's [[city council]] had enacted [[local ordinance|ordinances]] barring the railroads from crossing the city's streets.<ref name="history RR"/> On November 26, 1853, the council was reconvened when [[railroad tie]]s were found being laid in the preparation for the gauge change. The council passed an ordinance to allow the mayor to call out the city's police to take down any of the railroad bridges that crossed the city's streets "in order to preserve the present railroad gauge".<ref name="history RR"/>

== Conflict ==
On December 7, 1853, after swearing in 150 "special police constables"<ref name="history RR"/>, Mayor Alfred King led the police to the railroad bridge crossing State and French streets and, where engineers had marked the edges of the streets on the bridges, had sections of the bridges cut out.<ref name="history RR"/> That evening, {{convert|7|mi|km}} away in town of [[Harborcreek Township, Pennsylvania|Harborcreek]], its citizens decided to pass its own ordinances and then preceded to tear up tracks along the highway.<ref name="history"/> Three days later, tracks of the new gauge were completed up to the [[city limits]] and that night the people of Harbor Creek tore out the tracks again, knocked down a bridge, and even ploughed up a [[level crossing]].<ref name="history"/> An [[injunction]] was obtained by the railroad from the [[United States Circuit Court]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and a [[United States Marshal]] was dispatched to Harborcreek. Upon arriving in Harborcreek, the marshal served it to one of the officials of Harborcreek and pointed out the [[seal of the United States]].<ref name="penn"/> The official promptly threw it on the ground and stomped it with his heel and declaring the heelmark "the seal of Harborcreek."<ref name="penn"/>

The most serious incident occurred on December 27, 1853, when a train of railroad officials and workers was stopped outside of Harborcreek by a crowd of people ripping up the tracks. An official shot at one the men in the crowd and the crowd, who believed the man to be dead, but was only knocked unconscious, chased the official back on to his train. After two or three members of the crowd forced their way on to the train, the train reversed and "headed at full speed for the state line".<ref name="penn"/> Once across the border, the train stopped, and [[stowaway]]s from Harborcreek were sent back over border into Pennsylvania.

== Reactions ==
[[Pennsylvania Governor]] [[William Bigler]] sympathized with Erie saying:

{{cquote|Pennsylvania holds the key to this important link of connexion [sic] between the East and the West, and I most unhesitatingly say, that where no principle of amity or commerce is to be violated, it is the right and the duty of the State to turn her natural advantages to the promotion of the views and welfare of her own people.<ref name>{{cite book |last=Egle |first=William Henry |title=[[Pennsylvania Archives]] |year=1902 |volume=VII |series=4 |pages=[http://books.google.com/books?id=76IMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0 651] |publisher=State of Pennsylvania |location=[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]]}}</ref>}}
{{Rquote|right|Let Erie be avoided by all travelers until grass shall grow in her streets.|[[Horace Greeley]]|''[[New York Tribune]]''}}

Although the governor and state of Pennsylvania agreed with Erie's objectives, people in other states criticized Pennsylvania for its "selfishness". The [[United States Representative]] from Ohio, [[Edward Wade]], suggested that Pennsylvania's nickname be changed to the "[[Shylock]] State" because it "demanded a 'pound of flesh' from all who passed its borders".<ref>''[[Congressional Record|Congressional Globe]]'', [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], [[33rd United States Congress|33rd Congress]], 1st Session, [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&fileName=033/llcg033.db&recNum=231 230].</ref> 

On December 26, 1853, [[Horace Greeley]], editor of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', had to travel through Erie on his way to [[Chicago]] and had to travel from Harborcreek to Erie in an open [[sleigh]] "through a cutting storm of wind, snow, and sleet". Greeley had hoped to be able to give a lecture in [[Adrian, Michigan]], that same day "but that could not now be, for the Kingdom of Erie forbade it".<ref name="penn"/>

== Resolution ==
In January 1854, with the repeal of the [[Missouri Compromise]] by the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], the Erie Gauge War stopped attracting attention.<ref name=history/>

On January 28, the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] passed legislation maintaining "the break at Erie" and repealing the charter for the Franklin Canal Company. Governor Bigler appointed future governor [[William F. Packer]] to state superintendent and personally took control of the Franklin Canal Company on February 1.<ref name="penn"/> With Bigler in Erie, the tracks and bridges of the Erie and North East were replaced without any difficulty.
