==History==
Bank of Kigali was started in 1966, to provide commercial banking services to individuals, small businesses and large corporations. Prior to 2007, the bank was 50% owned by '''Banque Belgolaise''', before the [[Government of Rwanda]] purchased that shareholding. Subsequently, the government sold minority shareholding to other corporate entities, including the Social Security Fund of Rwanda (SSFR), and the National Post Office of Rwanda (NPR). Plans are underway for the government to divest more of its ownership in the bank by floating 25% shareholding on the [[Rwanda Stock Exchange]] (RSE), in 2011.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201012300128.html Government To Float Its Shares In Bank of Kigali]</ref> On 21 June 2011, the Rwandan '''Capital Market Advisory Council''' (CMAC) gave its approval for Bank of Kigali to float 45% of its shares on the RSE, as well as to list its shares on the stock exchange. Trading in the shares of the bank is expected to start on 30 June 2011.<ref>[http://allafrica.com/stories/201106210810.html Bank of Kigali Gets Approval to Trade Shares]</ref> In April 2012, International media reports indicated that Bank of Kigali was in the middle of an expansion into neighboring [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].<ref>[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/rwandas-biggest-bank-expand-kenya-uganda-140327093--sector.html  Bank of Kigali Expands Into Kenya & Uganda]</ref>
