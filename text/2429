He is also a producer and the former [[television presenter]] of the game show ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]''. He started his movie career in 1969, with ''[[Saat Hindustani]]'' and continues today to be a prominent figure in the [[Bollywood]] film industry. He is regarded as one of the finest actors in Indian cinema. He continues to be one of the most highly-paid actors in the industry, and is considered one of the biggest megastars the Indian film industry has produced.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
Amitabh Bachchan was born in the city of [[Allahabad]], [[India]] to mother Teji and father Harivansh Rai Bachchan. Dr. [[Harivansh Rai Bachchan]] was a well-known poet of [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]]. Though his surname was Srivastava, he adopted the pen-name Bachchan, under which was published all his work. It is with this last name that Amitabh debuted in films, and, for all public purposes, it has become the surname of all members of the current family. His mother is [[Sikh]], born in [[Punjab]] and his father was a [[Hindu]] [[Kayastha]] from [[Uttar Pradesh]], hence popularly known as an 'UPite'.  

Bachchan attended [[Allahabad]]'s Boys' High School, followed by [[Nainital]]'s [[Sherwood College]], where he majored in the art stream. He later went on to study at [[Kirori Mal College]] in [[Delhi University]] earning a degree in science. In his twenties, Bachchan gave up a job as freight broker for the shipping firm, Bird and Co., based in [[Kolkata]], to pursue a career in acting. 

He married actress [[Jaya Bhaduri]] in 1973. The couple have two children: daughter, [[Shweta Bachchan-Nanda|Shweta]] and son [[Abhishek Bachchan]] who is also an Indian-film actor.

In 1982, on the set of [[Manmohan Desai]]'s ''[[Coolie (film)|Coolie]]'', Bachchan suffered a near-fatal blow to his abdomen. While shooting an action scene for the film, Bachchan hit and injured himself on a prop table. The wound was suffered by his small intestine. Later stating that he thought to ignore the pain initially, and considered that the matter might be something serious once it became almost unbearable some hours later, Bachchan spent months recuperating at Bombay's Breach Candy Hospital. During this period, it is reported that thousands of Amitabh fans, nation-wide, offered prayers and condolences for his health and recovery. It has even been reported that two suicides were linked to the event.<ref>[http://www.shashitharoor.com/articles/lat220603.html In praise of the cinema god]</ref>

In 1984, Amitabh briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend, [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. He contested Allahabad's Parliament seat against H. N. Bahuguna, a well-known politician, and won by a large margin (68.2% of the vote).<ref name=election>{{cite web| url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm|title=Amitabh Bachchan: Stint in Politics| publisher=HindustanTimes.com| accessdate=2005-12-05}}</ref> His political career, however, was short-lived: He resigned after three years, leaving his term incomplete. The resignation followed Bachchan's implication in the '[[Bofors scandal]]' by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan|title=Interview with Amitabh Bachchan| publisher=sathnam.com}}</ref> Bachchan was eventually found not to be guilty of involvement in the ordeal. {{Fact|date=February 2007}}But since then he detached himself from Gandhi family and after demise of Late Rajiv Gandhi he started buttering the Mulayam and Amar Singhs for his own sake to save his property and several financial bungling etc.

In November of 2005, Amitabh Bachchan was admitted to Lilavati Hospital once more, to undergo surgery on his stomach. This occurred after Bachchan complained of pains in his abdomen some days prior. During the period and that following his recovery, most of his projects were put on hold, including the television show he was in the process of hosting, ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]''. Amitabh returned to work in March of 2006 <ref> {{cite web|url=http://www.freenewmexican.com/readerblogs/40440.html|title=Amitabh Bachchan returns to work|publisher=freenewmiexican.com}}</ref>

Bachchan is also an asthmatic, suffers from [[Thalassaemia]] Minor, and suffers from a rare muscle disease, [[Myasthenia Gravis]].

Many people think that he has asthma from smoking.

===Early film career===
Amitabh Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as one of the seven leads in '' [[Saat Hindustani]]''. The movie was not a financial success, but there was little doubt of the promise he held when the performance won him his first [[National Film Award]] <ref name="First national award">{{cite web | title=movies.indiatimes.com| work=Bachchan wins his first national award|url=http://movies.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1905623.cms| accessdate=11 March| accessyear=2007}}</ref>. 

The critically acclaimed ''[[Anand (film)|Anand]]'' (1970) followed, where he starred alongside the reigning superstar of the industry at the time, [[Rajesh Khanna]]. Bachchan held his own, and won a [[Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]] for his intense performance.

''[[Anand]]'' was followed by unsuccessful films such as ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971) and ''[[Parwaana]]'' (1971). Then came 1973, and the start of the road towards the iconic status he would eventually come to hold for millions worldwide.

Bachchan's first box office success came when director [[Prakash Mehra]] cast him as the protagonist in his film, ''[[Zanjeer]]''. The movie was a sharp contrast to the romantic-themed ones that had generally preceded it, and established Amitabh in a new persona - the "Angry young man" of Bollywood. The next decade catapulted him to the pinnacle of Bollywood superstardom. He churned out at least one major hit every year, including ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Sholay (1975 film)|Sholay]]'' (1975) , ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978), ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikander]]'' (1978), ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978), ''[[Kasme Vaade]]'' (1978), ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'' (1979) and ''[[Lawaaris]]'' (1981). These films cemented his image as the "angry young man".

As his success grew, Amitabh displayed a flair for more than just action roles. His remarkable comic timing was on display in such hits as ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' (1975), ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977) ''[[Do Aur Do Paanch]]'' (1980), and ''[[Namak Halaal]]'' (1982). He was also successful as a romantic lead, with particularly notable performances in ''[[Kabhie Kabhie]]'' (1976)  and ''[[Silsila]]'' (1981). The latter was notorious for its tinges of real-life, starring as he did alongside his then-wife [[Jaya Bachchan]], and rumored flame [[Rekha]].

While filming ''[[Coolie (film)|Coolie]]'' in 1982, Bachchan was seriously injured during the filming of a fight scene with co-star [[Puneet Issar]] <ref name="Coolie fight scene">{{cite web | title=rediff.com| work=Bachchan injured whilst shooting scene|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm| accessdate=11 March| accessyear=2007}}</ref>. He was in the hospital with a ruptured intestine for months, and at times was close to death. A remarkable outpouring of support and concern by his fans and the nation in general followed. After recovering, Bachchan resumed shooting for ''[[Coolie (film)|Coolie]]'', and it finally released as a huge success owing to its pre-release publicity <ref name="Coolie">{{cite web | title=boxofficeindia.com| work=Coolie a success|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/80-89.htm| accessdate=11 March| accessyear=2007}}</ref>.

The director, [[Manmohan Desai]] altered the ending for ''[[Coolie (film)|Coolie]]'' after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen as well. Also, remarkably, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident <ref name="Footage of Coolie fight scene">{{cite web | title=imdb.com| work=Footage of fight scene in Coolie released to the public|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085361/trivia| accessdate=11 March| accessyear=2007}}</ref>.

===Later film career===
Bachchan reigned supreme from the 70s through to the mid-1980s, and was by far the dominant figure in Bollywood. Starting in 1988, however, his star began to wane as all of his films failed at the box office. The 1991 hit film ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'' looked like it might reverse this trend, but the momentum was short-lived. Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this period that Bachchan won his second [[National Film Award]], for his memorable performance as a Mafia don in [[Mukul S. Anand]]'s 1990 film ''[[Agneepath]]''. These years would be the last he would be seen on screen for some time. After the release of ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'' in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years.

In 1997, he attempted to make his comeback with the film ''[[Mrityudaata]]'', produced by his own company, Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, Ltd. (A.B.C.L.), which he had founded during his temporary retirement. It attempted to reprise his earlier success as an action hero, but, along with most of his other ventures during this period, was a failure both critically and financially. He did later score a box office hit with ''[[Bade Miyan Chote Miyan]]'' (1998) and received positive reviews for ''[[Sooryavansham]]'' (1999) but most, however, now believed that Amitabh Bachchan's glory days were over.
[[Image:Amitabh.JPG|thumb|Amitabh Bachchan's return as a superstar on KBC]]

In the year 2000, Bachchan stepped up to host India's adaptation of the British television game-show, ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'' entitled, ''[[Kaun Banega Crorepati]]''. As it did in most other countries by which it was adopted, the program found immediate and profound success, in no small part due to Bachchan's charisma.

That same year, Bachchan appeared in [[Yash Chopra]]'s box-office hit, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'', in which he played a stern, older figure, rival to the character of India's new hearthrob, [[Shah Rukh Khan]]. Audiences appreciated this new, more age-befitting style. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older patriarch in ''[[Ek Rishta]]'' (2001), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham]]'' (2001) and ''[[Baghban]]'' (2003). As an actor, he continued to exploit his range, receiving critical acclaim for his performances in ''[[Aks]]'' (2001), ''[[Khakee]]'' (2004), ''[[Dev (film)|Dev]]'' (2004) and most notably ''[[Black (film)|Black]]'' (2005). Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh started endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. 

Recently he starred with his son Abhishek in the hit films ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' tribute ''[[Sarkar (film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna]]'' (2006) <ref name="Starring with son">{{cite web | title=boxofficeindia.com| work=Amitabh and Abhishek rule the box office|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/2005.htm | accessdate=11 March| accessyear=2007}}</ref>. His recent releases in 2007 are big flops (Eklavya and Nisbhad).  Moreover for Nishbad he has been received several shoes and chappals for supporting the American Society's culture in India, where he entangled in love affairs with his daughter's friend.  A most shameful event of his manipulated career.

His forthcoming releases include a supporting role in his first international film titled ''[[Shantaram (film)|Shantaram]]'' which is directed by [[Mira Nair]] and stars [[Hollywood]] actor [[Johnny Depp]] in the lead <ref name="Hollywood">{{cite web | title=ourbollywood.com| work=Amitabh Bachchan to star with Johnny Depp|url=http://www.ourbollywood.com/2007/02/amitabh_bachchan_will_star_opp.html| accessdate=11 March| accessyear=2007}}</ref>

* At the age of 64, Amitabh Bachchan created a cinematic world record.

* Although Amitabh Bachchan has received two national awards, it is still less than southern counterparts like [[Mammootty]], [[Mohanlal]] and [[Kamal Haasan]].
