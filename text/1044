=== Toponymy ===
Didsbury derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon ''Dyddi's burg'', probably referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was<ref name="Didsbury District">{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/districts/didsbury.html |title= Didsbury: Districts & Suburbs of Manchester |work=Manchester UK |publisher=Papillon Graphics|accessdate=14 September 2007}}</ref> on a low cliff overlooking a place where the river [[Mersey]] could be forded.  In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury, or Dodesbury.<ref name="Township:Didsbury"/>

=== Parish Church ===
[[File:Exterior of St James.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=photograph|[[Church of St James, Didsbury]] in 2013]]
A charter granted in about 1260 shows that a corn-grinding mill was operating in Didsbury, along the River Mersey,<ref name="Township:Didsbury" /> but the earliest reference to Didsbury is in a document dating from 1235, recording a grant of land for the building of a chapel.<ref name=St James'>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=924&pageNumber=2 |title= Didsbury St James Conservation Area |work=manchester.gov.uk |publisher=Manchester City Council |accessdate=20 September 2007 |at=History}}</ref> The church was named [[Church of St James, Didsbury|St James Church]] in 1855.

The parsonage soon gained a reputation for being haunted; servants refused to sleep on the premises, and it was abandoned in 1850. Local alderman Fletcher Moss bought the house in 1865, and lived in it for more than 40&nbsp;years. In 1902, he installed wrought iron gates at the entrance to the parsonage's garden, which, because of the building's reputation, became known locally as "the gates to Hell". The parsonage became a museum, now closed, but the gardens are still open to the public.{{sfnp|Cooper|2003|pp=36<U+2013>39|ps=}} The area around St James Church has the highest concentration of [[listed building]]s in Manchester, outside the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=924&pageNumber=3 |title=Didsbury St James Conservation Area |work=manchester.gov.uk |publisher=Manchester City Council |accessdate=20 September 2007 |at=Didsbury St James and its buildings today}}</ref>

=== River Mersey ===
Didsbury was one of the few places between Stretford and Stockport where the River Mersey could be [[Ford (crossing)|forded]], which made it significant for troop movements during the [[English Civil War]], in which Manchester was on the [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] side. The [[Cavalier|Royalist]] commander, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor. It is also likely that [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745, in the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in his subsequent retreat.<ref name="LivesAndTimes"/>

=== Immigration from Europe ===
Jewish immigrants started to arrive in Manchester from the late 18th century, initially settling mainly in the suburbs to the north of the city. From the 1890s onwards, many of them moved to what were seen as the more "sophisticated" suburbs in the south, such as Withington and Didsbury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movinghere.org.uk/galleries/histories/jewish/settling/manchester_jewry_9.htm# |title=The Moves to the Suburbs |publisher=Moving Here, Bill Williams|accessdate=8 October 2007}}</ref> The influx of Jewish immigrants led to West Didsbury being nicknamed "Yidsbury" and Palatine Road, a main road through West Didsbury, "Palestine Road".{{sfnp|Zenner|2000|p=72|ps=}}

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
During the Victorian expansion of Manchester, Didsbury developed as a prosperous settlement; a few mansions from the period still exist on Wilmslow Road between Didsbury Village and Parrs Wood to the east and Withington to the north, but they have now been converted to nursing homes and offices. The opening of the [[Midland Railway]] line in 1880 contributed greatly to the rapid growth in the population of Didsbury, with stations at Didsbury and Withington and West Didsbury offering easy rail connections to [[Manchester Central railway station|Manchester Central]]. The line closed in 1967, although Didsbury station building remained standing until its demolition in the 1980s. The station clock and water fountain have survived, dedicated to local doctor and campaigner for the poor, Dr. J. Milson Rhodes.<ref name="francewoodall"/>

On 28&nbsp;April 1910, French pilot [[Louis Paulhan]] landed his [[Farman]] biplane in Barcicroft Fields, Pytha Fold Farm, on the borders of Withington, Burnage and Didsbury, at the end of the [[1910 London to Manchester air race|first flight from London to Manchester in under 24&nbsp;hours]], with one short overnight stop at Lichfield. Arriving at 5:30&nbsp;am, Paulhan beat the British contender, [[Claude Grahame-White]], winning a <U+00A3>10,000 prize offered by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.{{sfnp|Vivian|2004|pp=132<U+2013>133|ps=}} This was the first powered flight into Manchester from any point outside the city. Two special trains were chartered to the newly built but unopened Burnage Station to take spectators to the landing, many of whom had stood throughout the night. Paulhan's progress was followed throughout by a special train carrying his wife, [[Henri Farman]] and his mechanics. Afterwards his train took the party to a civic reception given by the Lord Mayor of Manchester in the Town Hall. A house in Paulhan Road, constructed in the 1930s near the site of his landing, is marked by a [[blue plaque]] to commemorate his achievement.{{sfnp|Scholefield|2004|p=211|ps=}}

=== Civic history ===
In the early 13th century, Didsbury lay within the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Withington, a feudal estate that also included the townships of [[Withington]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], [[Moss Side]], [[Rusholme]], [[Burnage]], [[Denton, Greater Manchester|Denton]] and [[Haughton, Greater Manchester|Haughton]], ruled by the Hathersage, Longford and Tatton families,<ref>{{cite book |last= Sussex & Helm |title= Looking Back at Withington and Didsbury |publisher= Willow |year= 1988 |isbn= 0-946361-25-8 |page=45}}</ref> and within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]].<ref name="gazette"/> Didsbury remained within the manor of Withington for several centuries.

By 1764, Didsbury was described as a township in its own right.<ref name="francewoodall">{{cite book

In 1904, Withington Urban District was amalgamated into the city and [[county borough]] of Manchester, and so Didsbury was absorbed into Manchester, although it remained a civil parish until 1910. Following the [[Local Government Act 1972]], Manchester became a [[metropolitan borough]] of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Greater Manchester]].

=== Political representation ===
Didsbury is in the [[parliamentary constituency]] of [[Manchester Withington (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Withington]], and is represented by [[John Leech (politician)|John Leech MP]], a member of the [[Liberal Democrats]].

Until 2004, most of the area formed the Didsbury [[Ward (politics)|ward]] of [[City of Manchester|Manchester City Council]] with a section of West Didsbury contained within the Barlow Moor ward. However, [[Boundary Commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary changes]] in 2004 resulted in Didsbury being split mainly between the two new wards of Didsbury East and Didsbury West while a small section of West Didsbury was incorporated into the new ward of [[Chorlton Park]].<ref name="KirstyEllery">{{cite news

== Geography ==
{{Further2|[[Geography of Greater Manchester]]}}
[[File:Didsbury 1905.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Ordnance survey]] map of Didsbury from 1905]]
Didsbury, at {{Coord|53|24|59|N|2|13|51|W|type:city}} (53.4166, <U+2212>2.2311), is south of the midpoint of the [[Greater Manchester Urban Area]], {{convert|4.5|mi|km|1}} south of Manchester city centre. To the north, Didsbury is bordered by [[Withington]], [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] and [[Burnage]], to the west by [[Northenden]], to the east and south-east by [[Heaton Mersey]] and [[Cheadle, Greater Manchester|Cheadle]], and by [[Gatley]] to the south.

The [[River Mersey]] forms Didsbury's southern and southwestern boundaries and certain stretches of the river also demarcate the boundaries of the [[City of Manchester]]. The area is generally considered to be roughly enclosed by Princess Parkway to the west, Kingsway to the east and the Ball Brook, just north of Lapwing Lane/Fog Lane to the north. This northern boundary is marked by a boundary stone in the front garden wall of a house on the west side of Wilmslow Road. A "country trail" passes from West Didsbury to East, named the Trans Pennine Trail ([[National Cycle Network|National Cycle Route]] 62). It was sited along a disused railway track, as part of a nationwide initiative to promote cycling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?categoryID=100011&documentID=732&pageNumber=4 |title=Cycling in Manchester |publisher=Manchester City Council|work=manchester.gov.uk|at=Signed Cycle Routes in Manchester|accessdate=19 September 2008}}</ref>

Didsbury's built environment has developed around the areas of East Didsbury, West Didsbury, and Didsbury Village, which separates the two. The Albert Park conservation area, covering much of West Didsbury, places planning restrictions on development, alterations to buildings, and pruning of trees. The areas adjacent to the Mersey lie within the river's flood plain, and so have historically been prone to flooding after heavy rainfall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salecommunityweb.co.uk/rivermersey.htm|title=Flooding |publisher=SaleCommunityWeb |accessdate=16 September 2007}}</ref> The last major flooding was in the late 1960s. In the 1970s extensive flood mitigation work carried out along the Mersey Valley through Manchester has helped to speed up the passage of floodwater. [[Fletcher Moss Botanical Garden]] also acts as an emergency flood basin, storing floodwater until it can be safely released back into the river.<ref name="Exploring Greater Manchester">{{cite web |title=Exploring Greater Manchester |publisher=Manchester Geographical Society |url=http://www.mangeogsoc.org.uk/egm/5_1.pdf |format=PDF |year=1998 |accessdate=6 May 2007}}</ref>

Didsbury is close to junction 5 of Manchester's [[ring road]], the [[M60 motorway]]. [[Manchester Airport]], the busiest airport in the UK outside London,<ref>{{cite news |first=James |last=Wilson |title=A busy hub of connectivity |work=[[Financial Times]] <U+2013> FT report <U+2013> doing business in Manchester and the NorthWest |publisher=The Financial Times Limited |date=26 April 2007}}</ref> is about 4&nbsp;miles (6.5&nbsp;km) to the south.

Didsbury is served by several bus routes into Manchester city centre, [[The Trafford Centre]], [[Northenden]], and other destinations. [[Wilmslow Road, Manchester|Wilmslow Road]] provides Didsbury with a regular bus service due to the strong demand for travel by students along the corridor. The service is cheap and passengers rarely have to wait more than a couple of minutes. According to some analysts, Wilmslow Road is the busiest bus corridor in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeonmanchester.com/oxford-rd-manchester-buses/ |title=Didsbury as the "busiest bus corridor" |publisher=EyeOnManchester|first=Aidan |last=O'Rourke |date=26 October 2006 |accessdate=3 September 2007}}</ref>

[[East Didsbury railway station|East Didsbury]] and [[Burnage railway station|Burnage]] are the nearest railway stations, on the line between [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] and [[Manchester Airport]]. Between 1880 and 1967 the area had been served by two other railway stations, [[Didsbury railway station|Didsbury station]] and [[Withington and West Didsbury railway station|West Didsbury station]], both on the [[Template:Manchester Lines South|South Manchester lines]] into [[Manchester Central railway station|Manchester Central station]]. The entire line was shut in 1967 following the [[Beeching Axe]].

=== Metrolink ===
Proposals have existed since the 1980s to re-open the disused railway line which passes through Didsbury as part of the [[Manchester Metrolink]] light rail system.<ref name="metrolink1">{{citation |author=Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive |title=Light Rapid Transit in Greater Manchester |publisher=GMPTE |year=1984}} <U+2013> publicity brochure</ref> Under these proposals, Didsbury Station was to re-open under the name of Didsbury Central or Didsbury Village.

These extension plans were rejected by the government in 2004, due to escalating costs.<ref>{{cite web |last= Williams | first= Tony | title=  Manchester to Chorlton and East Didsbury |publisher=Light Transit Association |url= http://www.lrta.org/Manchester/funding.html#ph.three |date= 30 May 2007| accessdate= 1 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Fight for Metrolink will go on | publisher= M.E.N.

In May 2009, [[Association of Greater Manchester Authorities|AGMA]] agreed to the provision of additional funding that will secure the construction of Metrolink to the area. This will include additional stops at [[Withington Metrolink station|Withington]], [[Burton Road Metrolink station|Burton Road]], [[West Didsbury Metrolink station|West Didsbury]], [[Didsbury Village Metrolink station|Didsbury Village]] and [[East Didsbury Metrolink station|East Didsbury]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/8047020.stm |title=Tram line extension is approved|date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=11 June 2009 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Final government approval for government funding for the Chorlton cum Hardy - East Didsbury Metrolink extension using a closed railway line was granted in March 2010 by Transport Minister Sadiq Khan.
