== Function ==
The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the [[protein tyrosine phosphatase]] (PTP) family. Protein tyrosine phosphatases are protein enzymes that remove [[phosphate]] moieties from [[tyrosine]] residues on other proteins. Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that add phosphates to tyrosine residues, and are the opposing enzymes to PTPs. PTPs are known to be signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation.

The human PTPRK gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 6, a putative tumor suppressor region of the genome. <ref name="pmid9722959">{{cite journal| author=Zhang Y, Siebert R, Matthiesen P, Yang Y, Ha H, Schlegelberger B| title=Cytogenetical assignment and physical mapping of the human R-PTP-kappa gene (PTPRK) to the putative tumor suppressor gene region 6q22.2-q22.3. | journal=Genomics | year= 1998 | volume= 51 | issue= 2 | pages= 309-11 | pmid=9722959 | doi=10.1006/geno.1998.5323  }} </ref>
