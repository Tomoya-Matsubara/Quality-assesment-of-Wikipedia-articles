'''''This Is Your FBI''''' was a radio crime drama which aired in the [[United States]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from April 6, 1945 to January 30, 1953 for a total of 409 shows. [[FBI]] chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] gave it his endorsement, calling it "the finest dramatic program on the air".

Producer-director Jerry Devine was given access to FBI files by Hoover, and the resulting dramatizations of FBI cases were narrated by [[Frank Lovejoy]] (1945), Dean Carleton (1946<U+2013>1947) and [[William Woodson]] (1948<U+2013>1953). Stacy Harris played the lead role of fictional Special Agent Jim Taylor. Others in the cast were [[William Conrad]], [[Bea Benaderet]], and [[Jay C. Flippen]].

''This Is Your FBI'' was sponsored during its entire run by the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (now [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company]]).
