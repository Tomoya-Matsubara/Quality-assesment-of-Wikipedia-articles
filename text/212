'''SMS ''Karlsruhe''''' was a [[light cruiser]] of the {{sclass|Karlsruhe|cruiser|4}} built by the German ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy). She had one [[sister ship]], {{SMS|Rostock}}; the ships were very similar to the previous {{sclass|Magdeburg|cruiser|1}}s. The ship was laid down in 1911, launched in November 1912, and completed by January 1914. Armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]], ''Karlsruhe'' had a top speed of {{convert|28.5|kn}}, which allowed her to escape from British cruisers during her career.

After her commissioning, ''Karlsruhe'' was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean. She arrived in the area in July 1914, days before the outbreak of [[World War I]]. Once the war began, she armed the passenger liner [[SS Kronprinz Wilhelm|SS ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'']], but while the ships were transferring equipment, British ships located them and pursued ''Karlsruhe''. Her superior speed allowed her to escape, after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil. Here, she captured or sank sixteen ships. While en route to attack the shipping lanes to [[Barbados]] on 4 November 1914, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew. The survivors used one of ''Karlruhe''{{'}}s [[collier (ship)|colliers]] to return to Germany in December 1914.

==Construction==
{{main|Karlsruhe class cruiser}}
''Karlsruhe'' was ordered under the contract name "''[[Ersatz]]'' {{SMS|Seeadler||2}}" and was laid down at the [[Germaniawerft]] shipyard in [[Kiel]] in 1911. She was launched on 11 November 1912, after which [[fitting-out]] work commenced. She was commissioned into the [[High Seas Fleet]] on 15 January 1914. The ship was {{convert|142.2|m|sp=us}} [[length overall|long overall]] and had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|13.7|m|abbr=on}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.38|m|abbr=on}} forward. She displaced {{convert|6191|t|abbr=on}} at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine [[steam turbine]]s driving two {{convert|3.5|m|adj=on|sp=us}} propellers. They were designed to give {{convert|26000|shp|lk=in}}, but reached {{convert|37885|shp|abbr=on}} in service. These were powered by twelve coal-fired Marine-type [[water-tube boiler]]s and two oil-fired double-ended boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of {{convert|28.5|kn}}. ''Karlsruhe'' carried {{convert|1300|t|LT}} of coal, and an additional {{convert|200|t|LT}} of oil that gave her a range of approximately {{convert|5000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|12|kn}}. ''Karlsruhe'' had a crew of 18 officers and 355 enlisted men.<ref name=G109>Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 109</ref>

The ship was armed with twelve [[10.5 cm SK L/45 naval gun|10.5&nbsp;cm SK L/45 guns]] in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the [[forecastle]], eight were located amidships, four on either side, and two were side by side aft.<ref name=C160>Gardiner & Gray, p. 160</ref> The guns had a maximum elevation of 30&nbsp;degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to {{convert|12700|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>Gardiner & Gray, p. 140</ref> They were supplied with 1,800 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. She was also equipped with a pair of {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on|1}} [[torpedo tube]]s with five [[torpedo]]es submerged in the hull on the [[broadside]]. She also could also carry 120 [[naval mine|mines]]. The ship was protected by a waterline [[armored belt]] that was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} thick amidships. The [[conning tower]] had {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} thick sides, and the deck was covered with up to 60&nbsp;mm thick armor plate.<ref name=G109/>

==Service history==

Following her commissioning in January 1914, ''Karlsruhe'' was assigned to overseas service,<ref name=G109/> under the command of ''[[Fregattenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' [[Erich K<U+00F6>hler (officer)|Erich K<U+00F6>hler]].<ref name=B75>Bennett, p. 75</ref> At the outbreak of [[World War I]] the following August, the ship was based in the Caribbean, along with the cruiser {{SMS|Dresden||2}}. She had anchored in [[Cay Sal Bank]] in the [[Florida Strait]] when she received warnings that war in Europe was imminent.<ref name=H78>Halpern, p. 78</ref> ''Karlsruhe''{{'}}s standing orders in the event of war saw the ship conducting a commerce raiding campaign against British merchant traffic.<ref>Bennett, p. 50</ref> To hunt down ''Karlsruhe'' and any merchant ships she might arm as [[auxiliary cruiser]]s, the [[Royal Navy]] deployed five cruiser squadrons, the most powerful were those commanded by Rear Admiral [[Christopher Craddock]] and Rear Admiral [[Archibald Peile Stoddart|Archibald Stoddart]]. The British were forced to disperse their ships to cover the areas in which the two German cruisers, and any auxiliary cruisers they might arm, could operate.<ref>Bennett, pp. 74&ndash;75</ref>

[[File:SMS Karlsruhe LOC ggbain 18974.jpg|thumb|''Karlsruhe'' coaling in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]]]
On 6 August, ''Karlsruhe'' rendezvoused with the passenger ship [[SS Kronprinz Wilhelm|SS ''Kronprinz Wilhelm'']] about {{convert|120|nmi|abbr=on}} north of [[Watling Island]]. ''Karlsruhe'' was in the process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner when Craddock, in his [[flagship]] {{HMS|Suffolk|1903|6}}, appeared to the south.<ref name=B75/> The Germans had only managed to transfer two 8.8&nbsp;cm guns, a machine gun, and some sailors by the time ''Suffolk'' arrived.<ref name=H78/> The two ships quickly departed in different directions; ''Suffolk'' followed ''Karlsruhe'' and other cruisers were ordered to intercept her. ''Karlsruhe''{{'}}s faster speed allowed her to quickly outpace Craddock, but at 20:15, {{HMS|Bristol|1910|2}} joined the pursuit and briefly fired on the German cruiser. ''Karlsruhe'' turned east and again used her high speed to evade the British ships. The British failed to relocate her, and by 9 August, ''Karlsruhe'' entered reached Puerto Rico with only 12 tons of coal in her bunkers.<ref name=B75/>

With limited options for coal in the Caribbean, K<U+00F6>hler took his ship down to the northeast coast of Brazil, off [[Pernambuco]]. The area was not as heavily patrolled by the British. Here, ''Karlsruhe'' had easy access to coal supplies, either from chartered [[collier (ship)|colliers]] or captured vessels. K<U+00F6>hler frequently kept one or two [[Prize (law)|prizes]] to assist in the search for targets.<ref name=H79>Halpern, p. 79</ref> In the course of her patrols off the Brazilian coast, ''Karlsruhe'' sank or captured sixteen merchant ships.<ref>Massie, p. 286</ref> These merchantmen, fifteen British ships and one Dutch vessel, totaled {{GRT|72805|first=yes}}. K<U+00F6>hler then decided to move to another area, as remaining in one area would increase his chances of being tracked down by the British. He turned his ship toward the [[West Indies]] to attack [[Barbados]] and [[Fort-de-France]] and the shipping lanes between Barbados and [[Trinidad]].<ref name=H79/> 

As ''Karlsruhe'' steamed to Barbados on the night of 4 November, a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship. The hull was split in half; the bow section quickly sank and took with it K<U+00F6>hler and most of the crew. The stern remained afloat long enough for 140 of the ship's crew to escape onto the attending colliers. Commander Studt, the senior surviving officer, took charge and placed all of his men aboard the liner ''Rio Negro''. He scuttled the second collier and steamed north for Iceland. The ship used the cover of a major storm to slip through the British blockade of the [[North Sea]], and put in at [[<U+00C5>lesund]], Norway. ''Rio Negro'' then returned to Germany by early December. The ''[[Admiralstab]]'', unaware of the loss of ''Karlsruhe'', coincidentally radioed the ship to order her to return to Germany.<ref name=B131>Bennett, p. 131</ref> Germany kept the loss of the ship a secret, and the British continued searching for her until they learned of her fate in March 1915.<ref name=H79/>
