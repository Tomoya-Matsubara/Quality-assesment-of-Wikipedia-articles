'''Christine "Chrissie" Watts''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]. She first appeared in April 2004 as the second wife of the show's "most enduring character", [[Den Watts]], becoming a prominent regular for the next 18 months. In 2005 she was the focus of one of "the programme<U+2019>s biggest and most high-profile narratives" when she killed her husband, Dirty Den, in a fit of rage during the special 20th anniversary episode. The broadcast, airing on 18 February, was watched by 14.34 million people, with "almost 60% of possible viewers" tuning in to see Chrissie take revenge. The character was credited by former head of BBC Drama Serials, [[Mal Young]], as "anchoring the success of the anniversary storyline", and was described on the news programme [[BBC Breakfast]] as the "centrepiece" of the show, with the on-screen drama playing out over the course of the year and culminating in Chrissie's departure in December.

Chrissie Watts was created by the production team to be more the "equal" of her notorious and villianous husband than his long-suffering first wife, [[Angie Watts|Angie]]. The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie "but with 15 more years of feminism behind her", and was hailed by the TV editor of the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' as "the only strong woman left in [[Walford]]". She became well known for her deviousness and "scheming",<ref name="trigg">{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2005/10/27/exclusive-trig-joins-who-115875-16298330/|title=Exclusive: Trigg joins Who|author=Methven, Nicola|newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror|Daily Mirror]]|location=London, England |date=27 October 2005|accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> echoing the traits of her husband, with the official ''EastEnders'' website characterising her as "happy to play mind games" and "often two steps ahead" of Den. As part of the [[Watts family]] her story lines centre on her tumultuous marriage to Den, relationship with his children, and the on-going feud with the rival [[Mitchell family]]. She was involved in numerous clashes with other female characters, Oberman noting that Chrissie had "had more fights on ''EastEnders'' than most women have in their whole lives", and was constantly scheming against those who got in her way, earning her the sobriquet of "super-bitch".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rainbownetwork.com/UserPortal/Article/Detail.aspx?ID=22118&sid=45|title=Top 10 Soap Bitches|publisher=Rainbownetwork.com|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref>

Oberman won praise for her "three-dimensional portrayal of a classic soap bitch", with Chrissie hailed as "helping revive the show's fortunes that had being lagging somewhat in recent years". According to ''[[The Mirror]]'' reporter Elizabeth Hassell the character became a "national TV heroine" to viewers shortly after arriving, for standing up to the antics of her dastardly husband, and is most often cited as a "strong" and "clever" woman;<ref>{{cite news |title=Sweet revenge: must see EastEnders |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119729891.html |newspaper=The Sunday Mercury |location=Birmingham, England |date=25 July 2004 |accessdate=2010-1-31 }}</ref><ref name="ultimate">{{cite news |title=Waspish and Witty - the ultimate insight into TV soaps |author=Stephen, Jaci |newspaper=[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]] |location=London, England |date=12 March 2005 |page=28 }}</ref> "hard as nails" in "the grand tradition of landladies of [[The Queen Victoria|the Queen Vic]]".<ref name="Breakfast"/> Although generally well received by viewers, the character was described as a "ludicrous Lady MacBeth wannabe" by Jim Shelley of the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. Other critics have variously called Chrissie a "witch",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/we-love-telly/2009/10/eastenders-jack-branning-eyes.html|title=Soapland blog|author=Stewart, Tony|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Daily Mirror]]|location=London, England |date=9 October 2009|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> "venomous", and the show's resident "black widow".

Their hair is always perfect, their bags match their gloves and shoes and scarves."<ref name="Star chat"/> The show's make-up artist, Elizabeth Armistead, has also spoken of the way Chrissie's "glamorous, polished look" informs her characterisation and personality: "Chrissie's a confident person who rarely leaves anything to chance.

===Mrs Den Watts===
Chrissie entered the show as the estranged wife of "one of the most iconic characters in soap history", Den Watts,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/973804/Whos-the-biggest-soap-villain|title=Who's soap's biggest villain|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]| date=28 March 2008|accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref> and was deliberately presented as "very different to the first Mrs. Watts."<ref name="2004 profile"/> When ''EastEnders'' began in 1985 viewers had watched Den's affairs and manipulation gradually take their toll on his wife, Angie, who was unable to compete in the games he played.<ref>{{cite web|title= EastEnders character Angie Watts|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_angie_w.shtml |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=4 June 2001 |accessdate=2010-2-7 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010407093630/www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/angie_w_biog.shtml |archivedate=10 June 2001}}</ref> Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's "equal" and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how "Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer - just like Den."<ref name="Hitched"/> Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: "Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can hold it together much better."<ref name="website interview"/> Indeed according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on [[Spencer Tracy]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]].<ref name="Radio4"/> Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: "What's great is that they've written Den an equal", Oberman noted, "It'll be interesting to see their little sparring matches."<ref name="website interview"/> The attraction was intended to be mutual, unlike Den's one-sided marriage to Angie. Trying to win Chrissie around into giving their marriage another try, Den declared: "I know we've got a great relationship even when we're tearing lumps out of each other, you give as good as you get and that's the sort of marriage I've always wanted".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Chrissie digs deeper |episodelink= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20040729.shtml |series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders|credits= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city=[[London]] |airdate=2004-7-29}}</ref> Commenting on the complicated nature of their relationship, Oberman observed,

The equality of their marriage was dramatically underscored towards the end of 2004, when Den, as a sign of faith and in an effort to woe back her sympathies, revealed to Chrissie his plans to reclaim The Queen Victoria public house by scamming the rival [[Mitchell family]]: "If you ever needed proof that we're in this together or how badly I need you in my life, this is it. I wasn't going to show this to another soul, but I'm showing you because you're my wife; because it's me and you together."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Den wants Chrissie back |episodelink= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20041111.shtml |series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders|credits= |station=[[BBC One]] |city=[[London]] |airdate=2004-11-11}}</ref>

In an interview with the official ''EastEnders'' website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: "They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he was always going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd always end up back together."<ref name="website interview"/> Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with [[Kate Mitchell]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the "better storylines" during an otherwise weak year for the show,<ref name="Everyone">{{cite news |title=Everyone<U+2019>s talking about: EastEnders |author=Green, Ru |url=http://www.questia.com/read/5008751784?title=Everyone%27s%20Talking%20About.%3a%20EastEnders |newspaper=Coventry Evening Telegraph |date=24 February 2005 |page=24|accessdate=2010-1-25 }}</ref> with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge.<ref name="Dirty Mrs Watts">{{cite news|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-119715394.html|title=Dirty Mrs Den|author=Bennet, Caroline|publisher=[[The People]]|date=25 July 2004|accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hissie Chrissie in a kat fight |author= |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119720176.html |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |date=25 July 2004 |accessdate=2010-2-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Soap watch: unkindest cut |author=Pratt, Steve |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10268726.html |newspaper=The Northern Echo |date=22 July 2004 |accessdate=2010-2-7 }}</ref> Commenting on the storyline's climax, a report in ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' spotlighted how "instead of collapsing in tears" as many female characters in ''EastEnders'' are wont to do, Chrissie "proves that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/209946/Kates-all-cut-up.html|title=Kate's all cut up|newspaper=The Sun|date=20 July 2005|accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref> The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: "cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode. I loved working with Jill and I think that put Chrissie on the map."<ref name="interview"/>

Chrissie left Den but was eventually convinced to give their marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: "I based Chrissie on [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary]]: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that."<ref>{{cite news |title=Diary |author=Kay, Richard |url= |newspaper=The Daily Mail |date=25 July 2006 |page=33 |accessdate=2010-1-31 }}</ref> She also saw the ebb and flow of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: "I think there's a challenge in it, and I think she would like to be the one who would ultimately tame him."<ref name="Radio4"/> As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior [[wikt:top dog|top dog]], [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]).

===Victim or villain===
To mark Chrissie's departure from the show, [[BBC Three]] aired a special episode of ''[[EastEnders Revealed]]'' on 22 September 2005. Entitled "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham, Dean, [[Kim Medcalf]], and Barbara Windsor profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. "A lot of viewers, and myself," Oberman later remarked, "really wanted Chrissie to get away with it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir have a lot in common <U+2013> the bad girls have to be punished."<ref name="Queen"/> However, critics considered Chrissie to be a "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure.<ref name="Telegraph article"/> Her feelings of guilt and remorse were represented side-by-side her desire to escape blame and manipulate others, and even led her on two separate occasions to the cusp of self-confession (both times stopped by [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) at the last minute). And despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" Oberman characterised Chrissie as "part victim part villain",<ref name="Stage">{{cite news|url=http://www.thecnj.co.uk/westend/2009/100909/wnews100909_03.html|title=Lady Porter role is so tough for Tracy-Ann|publisher=West End Extra|first=Jamie|last=Welham|date=9 October 2009|accessdate=2009-12-10}}</ref> declaring "I think of her as a villain with a heart".<ref name="sex symbol"/> She felt that, although "no excuse" for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did:<ref name="Breakfast"/> "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique",<ref name="sex symbol"/> and that "these characters are made, not born."<ref name="Telegraph article"/> Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid.

==Storylines==
===Backstory===
Chrissie Watts first appeared in ''EastEnders'' on 29 April 2004. She and Den had met in Spain and married some years earlier, during which time he was believed to be dead by his family and associates. Their marriage was tumultuous, with Chrissie eventually leaving Den after she saw him "pawing all over that tourist guide." She then learnt that Den had sold their bar and returned to the UK with "some girl"; Chrissie followed intent on recovering her share of the money.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Janine and Laura's catfight |episodelink= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/episodes/past/episode20040429.shtml |series=EastEnders|serieslink=EastEnders|credits= |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city=[[London]] |airdate=2004-4-29}}</ref>

===2004<U+2013>05===


Chrissie arrives in [[Walford]] in search of her husband Den. Their marriage has turned sour and he has sold their bar in Spain and taken the money. Den manages to persuade her to give their marriage another try, and to stay in Walford with him. She is shocked to discover he has children, [[Sharon Rickman|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), [[Dennis Rickman|Dennis]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), and [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]), and that while he was in Spain with her, he was in exile after faking his own death. She starts work as a [[hairdresser]] in [[Kate Mitchell]]'s ([[Jill Halfpenny]]) nail salon and helps stepdaughter Vicki with her plans to enter fashion school. However, Den's elusive behaviour raises her suspicions that he is having an affair. He almost convinces her that she is mistaken, but she eventually learns that her fears were correct and uncovers the affair between Den and Kate. Feigning friendship, she hacks off most of Kate's hair and smashes up the beauty salon in a rage. She leaves Walford distraught at Den's betrayal.

Den departs for Spain on business, and Chrissie returns to the salon as she remains the co-owner. She remains hostile to Kate for some time, but eventually calls a truce. She then becomes concerned over Vicki's much older boyfriend, and exposes him as a liar. At this point, Den returns intent on securing her forgiveness. However, she does not succumb to his charm offensive, and so as a demonstration of his affection he confides in her of his plans to bankrupt the Mitchell family and take control of the [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]], declaring that he can't do it without her. She relents, but warns if he ever cheats again she will kill him. Together, they scam the Mitchell family out of their holdings and move into the Vic on Christmas day, 2004.

In January, Dennis catches Den and his girlfriend Zoe Slater in bed together and tells Chrissie who is stunned. Zoe discovers she is pregnant by Den. Chrissie persuades her to [[Abortion|abort]] the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and [[adultery]], Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding at the other side of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to lock all the doors. Den grabs Chrissie's leg and she picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.

[[Image:Dens death77.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Chrissie kneeling over Den's body during the 20th anniversary episode. All told the episode was seen by over 17 million viewers (nearly 1/3 of the British population).<ref name="Telegraph article"/>]]
Despite knowing her innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that she has killed Den. Consequently a power struggle breaks out between Sam <U+2014> who wants her pub back in return for her silence <U+2014> and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publically accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time; however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hides it at her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) what has happened before she goes.

Dennis and Sharon return to Walford in search of their father. Sam grows frustrated and smashes up Den's grave in the hope that Chrissie will be sent down for his death. This backfires and Sam is arrested on suspicion of murder as Den's blood stains are found under her sink and her story constantly changes. Chrissie gets Kat to get her cousin, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]), to give a false alibi that Zoe and Chrissie were with her on the night Den died. Sam's mother, [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]), returns to Walford to free Sam, and slaps Chrissie during Den's funeral. The slap causes Chrissie to fall into Den's grave on top of the coffin.

Chrissie plans to sell the pub to [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, although [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) taunt Chrissie. Chrissie though, is unmoved, as Sharon still supports her <U+2013> however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den<U+2019>s daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]) outside of Johnny<U+2019>s club. Chrissie had confessed to Jake of her part in Den<U+2019>s death, and let<U+2019>s slip information about her guilt as they argue. This is caught on [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake of the recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her she will not get the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.

Chrissie discovers that [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) is the mystery buyer of the pub, and she and Jake make a quick sale to Ian before fleeing the Square. At the airport, they see Sharon, Phil and Grant with the police. Sharon punches Chrissie, who is then arrested for Den's murder. Chrissie says that she will only co-operate in exchange for a meeting with Sharon. This is earned, and she tries to make Sharon realise why she killed her father, to no avail. She reveals that she forged Den's signature on the document in which Den handed over the pub to Chrissie, thus the pub legally belongs to Sharon. Jake visit Chrissie in jail and asks her to marry him. She finds out he has lost the <U+00A3>25,000 that was to be her bail money, and storms out of the visiting room, calling Jake an idiot. She begins plotting revenge on Sharon for sending her to prison by trying to force her to testify in court about what Den was really like, wanting to see Sharon crumble at confessing how he cheated and supposedly beat her mother (which he never did). After a week in prison, she gives up and dismisses her solicitor, and decides to plead guilty to murder. She walks into her cell with a contented smile.

Though Chrissie is not seen again, when Sam (now played by [[Danniella Westbrook]]) returns to Walford in September 2009, she is arrested for her role in Den's murder and expresses a fear of running into Chrissie in prison.

==Reception==
As the wife of Den Watts, one of British soap's biggest figures, Chrissie was a high profile character, with the turns in her storylines regularly splashed across the tabloid papers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/173809/Bangers-n-bash.html|title=Bangers 'n Bash|work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=3 November 2004|accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref> According to Steve Hendry of the ''Daily Mail'' (Glasgow), Oberman was an "overnight success" in the role of Chrissie, and successully "excerised the iconic ghost of long-dead Queen Vic lush Angie Watts", becoming, in the words of reporter Katherine Hassell, "a national TV heroine... after she arrived in Albert Square in 2004 as the wife of the resurrected Dirty Den".<ref name="heroine">{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/life-style/kids-and-family/2009/06/12/former-eastender-s-actress-tracy-ann-oberman-talks-celebrity-masterchef-motherhood-and-marriage-115875-21433564/|title=Former EastEnders actress Tracy Ann Oberman talks Celebrity chef, motherhood, and marriage|newspaper=''The Mirror''|author=Hassell, Katherine|date=12 June 2009|accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref> The character's tough and steely persona was widely cited by TV critics. Imogen Ridgway of ''The Evening Standard'' felt Chrissie to be the "dominant female character" in the show, maintaining an increasingly threatened ''EastEnders'' tradition of the independent, forceful female figure: "For a soap originally underpinned by dominant female characters, it seems odd that Chrissie Watts is apparently the only strong woman left in Walford".<ref>{{cite news |title=Pick of the night |author=Ridgway, Imogen |url=http://www.questia.com/read/5008698107?title=Pick%20of%20the%20Night |newspaper=''Evening Standard'' |date=18 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-1-31 }}</ref>

The storyline involving Den's death was among the most prominent of the decade, and generated intense media and public interest. Looking back on the period, Oberman noted the remarkable nature of the story:

{{cquote|At the time, you get so involved with the work you don't think about it. However, I didn't realise how much of an enormous impact that storyline had. When I think back to how Michelle, Kim [Medcalf] and I were on the cover of the magazines week in and week out for about a month. The whole country was talking about it. That was a real moment for me. I took it a bit in my stride at the time but going to the [[National Television Awards|National TV Awards]] and being nominated for Best Newcomer was very exciting. I was only working there for a few weeks before becoming the landlady of The Queen Vic!<ref name="interview"/>}}

The special 1-hour 20th anniversary episode where Chrissie killed Den was watched by 14.34 million people on the night it was broadcast, attracting "almost 60% of possible viewers",<ref>{{cite news |title=14 million tune in as Den bows out |author=Desborough, James |publisher=''The People'' |date=20 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-1-28 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-128948797.html }}The episode has since only been bested by a single showing of ''Coronation Street'' and the 2007 ''EastEnders'' Christmas special (though all [[BBC1]] programs drew anomalously high viewers that day).

The liquid dried and his hair was glued to the floor. When he got up it ripped his hair out!"<ref name="laughs">{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a19368/eastenders-star-laughs-at-dens-death.html|title='EastEnders' star laughs at Den's death|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Kilkelly, Daniel|date=20 February 2005|accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>

The aftermath dominated ''EastEnders'' in 2005 and helped to revive the fortunes of the show. According to the former head of BBC Drama Serials, Mal Young, this was dependent on the character of Chrissie, who was responsible for "anchoring the success of the anniversary storyline".<ref>{{cite news |title=Why it's not the ender the road for EastEnders |author=Grant, Peter |publisher=''Liverpool Echo'' |url=http://www.questia.com/read/5008696319? |date=18 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-1-28 |page=10 }}</ref> A similar sentiment was expressed by Ian Hyland in the ''Sunday Mirror'', who although critical of the convuluted plot felt ''EastEnders'' was improving "mainly because Chrissie is doing her best to rescue the fallout from the storyline dirty bomb Den's murder has become", and described the character as performing a "rescue act" on the show.<ref>{{cite news |title=Doc's foxed it for Chrissie |author=Hyland, Ian |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-133737745.html |newspaper=Sunday Mirror |date=3 July 2005 |accessdate=2010-2-12 }}</ref> However, Jim Shelley of the ''Daily Mirror'' was highly critical of Chrissie, calling her "the ludicrous Lady MacBeth wannabe", and felt her departure was ennabling ''EastEnders'' to move forward.<ref>{{cite news |title=14 gone... it's a start but not the Ender the rot |author=Shelley, Jim |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-142320742.html |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=21 February 2005 |accessdate=2010-2-12 }}</ref> In contrast, the tv editor of the ''Telegraph'' hailed Chrissie as "helping revive the show's fortunes that had being lagging somewhat in recent years".<ref>{{cite news |title=Culture supliment: EastEnders on the up? |author=Hastings, Chriss |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=29 July 2005 |page=3 |location=London, England }}</ref>

Oberman has described her time on the show as "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reigns, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams.<ref name="script"/> Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they nenewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature in order to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers "must have been on crack", adding how "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense <U+2014> but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'".<ref name="script"/> She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I saw you kill Den.' I don't agree with censorship but there has to be a level of responsibility."

One of the consequences of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealled in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline "was put on hold and then there was a whole different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [they wouldn't do it]. And I'd moved straight on to ''[[Doctor Who]]'', too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'', I was pregnant and Kim was in ''Cabaret''." Because of this "I never felt it was finished off and I would have loved to have wrapped it up." She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?"<ref name="interview"/>

However, Oberman has continuously affirmed that she loved playing Chrissie, and of all her roles misses playing her the most.<ref name="Sam-Daliri"/> In a 2009 interview she commented on the significance of the character to ''EastEnders'' and viewers, saying "I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I still get a lot of letters about her, too. I think that she had as much of an impact as [[Janine Butcher|Janine]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) did, which surprised me. Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she was an amazing character with an epic storyline."<ref name="interview"/>

Oberman was nominated for a number of awards for her portrayal of Chrissie Watts. In 2004 for Most Popular Newcomer at the National Television Awards;<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0088512/awards|title=Awards for "EastEnders"|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref> She also received four nominations at the [[British Soap Awards]], for Best Newcomer in 2004, Villain of the Year in 2005 and 2006, and Soap Bitch of the Year in 2006.<ref name="imdb"/><ref name="custardsoapawards">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080202094430/http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/soapawards.html|url=http://www.thecustard.tv/linksandlists/soapawards.html|archivedate=2 February 2008|title=British Television Soap Awards|publisher=thecustard.tv|accessdate=20 April 2009}}</ref> In 2005, she was nominated for Best Actress and Best Bitch at the [[Inside Soap Awards]].<ref name="custardsoapawards"/>
