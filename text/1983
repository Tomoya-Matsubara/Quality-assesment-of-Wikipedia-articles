'''Nicholas James Adenhart''' (August 24, 1986&nbsp;<U+2013> April 9, 2009) was an [[United States|American]] [[Right-handedness|right-handed]] [[Major League Baseball]] [[starting pitcher]] for the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]]. In four career games, Adenhart pitched 18 innings and posted a win-loss record of 1<U+2013>0, with nine [[strikeout]]s and a 6.00 [[earned run average]] (ERA).

A graduate of [[Williamsport High School]], Adenhart was highly touted as a high school prospect until an injury in his final game required [[Tommy John surgery]]. He was drafted by the Angels in the 14th round of the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft]], and began playing in their minor league system after the surgery was a success. He spent three full years in the minor leagues before making his major league debut on May 1, 2008. After appearing in three games, Adenhart spent the rest of 2008 in the minor leagues developing his skills, and in 2009 he earned a spot in the Angels' starting rotation.

Just after pitching his first start of 2009, Adenhart was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Both the Angels and the [[Salt Lake Bees]], for whom Adenhart played for in 2008, suspended their next games. There were many tributes to him over the course of the season, including his former teammates spraying champagne and beer on one of his jerseys after they clinched the 2009 [[American League West]] division championship.

Adenhart transferred to [[Williamsport High School]] after his sophomore year, where he gave up basketball to focus solely on baseball, as a pitcher.

==Baseball career==
In his final high school game, in front of two dozen scouts, Adenhart felt a pop in his elbow after throwing a [[curveball]] to the third batter. The injury, which abruptly ended his season, was a partial ligament tear in his elbow that required [[Tommy John surgery]].<ref name=washingtonpost/> Though he had originally been projected as a first-round draft pick, the injury caused his stock to plummet two weeks before the [[2004 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref name=washingtonpost/> He fell to the 413th overall pick in the 14th round, selected by the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bal-adenhart20409,0,646234.story|title=Adenhart worth wait for Angels|last=Kubatko|first=Roch|date=August 1, 2004|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}</ref> Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting [[Eddie Bane]] convinced Adenhart to forego a scholarship offer from the University of North Carolina and signed him to a $710,000 bonus (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|710000|2004|2010|r=-4}}}} in 2010) on July 26, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/news/040726adenhart.html|title=Angels Sign Adenhart For $710,000|last=Callis|first=Jim|date=July 26, 2004|work=Baseball America|accessdate=November 16, 2009}}</ref> After having [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]] perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating his elbow at the Angels' rehab facility in [[Tempe, Arizona]].
