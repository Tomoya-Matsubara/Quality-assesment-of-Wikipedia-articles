==Investigation==
The investigation into Holloway's disappearance began shortly after she missed her flight home.  The island of Aruba has been extensively searched, especially in the month following Holloway's disappearance, though searches continue.  Ten individuals have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in Holloway's disappearance, however, no charges have been filed against anyone.

===Early investigation===
[[Image:CarlosnCharliesAruba.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carlos'n Charlie's]], where Holloway was last seen, in [[Oranjestad, Aruba]]]] 
On [[May 30]], [[2005]], immediately following Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty traveled to Aruba with friends by private jet.<ref name="PrimetimeNH">{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/national_world&id=3935503 |title=Dutch Teen Tells 'Primetime' About Night With Natalee Holloway |accessdate=2007-06-05 |date=2006-02-23 |publisher=ABC News}}</ref>  Within four hours of landing in Aruba, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with the name and address of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub.<ref name="PrimetimeNH"/> Beth Twitty has stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hansen |first=Chris |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23301056/page/2/ |title=The search for Natalee Holloway |accessdate=2008-05-28 |date=2008-02-22 |publisher=NBC News}}</ref> The Twittys and their friends, with two Aruban policemen, went to the Van der Sloot home looking for Holloway.  Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, with which Deepak Kalpoe, who was present, agreed:<ref name = "Vanity"/>  Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the [[California Lighthouse]] area of [[Arashi Beach]] because Holloway wanted to see sharks, before dropping Holloway off at her hotel around 2:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name="3More">{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/news/2005/0609/holloway_cnn.html |title=Three more arrested in Aruba case of missing teen |accessdate=2007-06-05 |date=2005-06-09 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>  According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused Van der Sloot's help.<ref name="3More"/>  He stated that she was then approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards as the young men drove away.<ref name="3More"/>

Searches for Holloway began soon afterwards.  Hundreds of volunteers from Aruba and the United States joined the search.  During the first days of the search, the Aruban government gave thousands of civil servants the day off to participate in the search.<ref name="MWWSLA"/> Fifty Dutch marines conducted an extensive search of the shoreline.<ref name="50Dutch">{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8118094/ |title=Aruba gripped by mystery over missing teen |accessdate=2007-07-15 |2005-06-06 |publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>  Aruban banks raised $20,000 and provided other support to aid volunteer search teams.<ref name = "demonstration"/>  Beth Twitty was provided with free housing, initially at the Holiday Inn where she stayed in her daughter's former room,<ref name="lighton">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,161499,00.html |title=Holloway's mom a media star |accessdate=2008-03-11 |date=2005-07-05 |publisher=FOXNews}}</ref> and then at the nearby [[Wyndham Hotels & Resorts|Wyndham Hotel]], where she stayed in the presidential suite.<ref name = "Vanity"/>

Reports indicate Holloway did not appear on any [[security camera]] footage from her hotel's lobby during the course of the night,<ref name="NewDNat"/> but it is unclear whether the security cameras at the hotel were actually working that night.

As the investigation continued, on [[June 11]], David Cruz, spokesman for the Aruban Minister of Justice, indicated that Natalee Holloway was dead and authorities knew the location of her body.<ref name="Cruz">{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159252,00.html |title=Reports Conflict in Case of Missing Ala.

On Friday, [[June 17]], a fourth person, later identified as [[disc jockey]] Steve Gregory Croes, was also arrested. Police Commissioner Jan van der Straten, who briefly headed the investigation before his retirement, told the media that "Croes was detained based on information from one of the other three detainees."<ref name="FNCThree"/>  On [[June 22]] Aruban police detained Paulus van der Sloot, Joran van der Sloot's father, for questioning; Paulus van der Sloot was arrested that same day.  Both Paulus van der Sloot and Croes were ordered to be released on [[June 26]].<ref name="freeatlast"/>

During this period the remaining detained suspects' stories changed.<ref name="freeatlast"/>  All three suspects indicated that Van der Sloot and Holloway were dropped off at the Marriott Hotel beach near the fishermen's huts.  Van der Sloot stated that he did not harm Holloway, but left her on the beach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,164514,00.html |title=Natalee suspect questioned by specialists |accessdate=2008-03-24 |date=2005-08-02 |publisher=Fox News}}</ref>  According to Satish Kalpoe's attorney, David Kock, Van der Sloot called Deepak Kalpoe to tell the latter that he was walking home, and sent him a text message forty minutes later.<ref name="freeatlast"/>

At some time during the interrogation Van der Sloot detailed a third account, that he was dropped off at home and Holloway was driven off by the Kalpoe brothers.<ref name = "Vanity"/>  Dompig discounted the story, stating:
<blockquote>
This latest story [came] when [Van der Sloot] saw the other guys, the Kalpoes, were kind of finger-pointing in his direction, and he wanted to screw them also, by saying he was dropped off.  But that story doesn't check out at all.  He just wanted to screw Deepak.  They had great arguments about this in front of the judge.  Because their stories didn't match.  This girl, she was from Alabama, she's not going to stay in the car with two black kids.  We believe the second story, that they were dropped off by the Marriott.<ref name="Vanity"/></blockquote>

On Monday, [[July 4]], following a hearing before a judge, Deepak and Satish Kalpoe were released, but Joran van der Sloot was detained for an additional sixty days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4650727.stm |title=Judge frees two Aruba suspects|accessdate=2008-03-22 |date=2005-06-04 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

In the months following his release, Joran van der Sloot gave several interviews, expanding upon his version of events, most notably a lengthy interview for ''[[On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren|On the Record]]'' which aired over three nights in March 2006.

Shortly before leaving the case, Dompig gave an interview to [[CBS]] correspondent [[Troy Roberts]], which was broadcast on [[March 25]], [[2006]].

Dompig described the behavior of Holloway and her fellow students, stating there was "wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every night.

===Arrest of new suspects, the Dutch take over the investigation===
On [[April 15]], [[2006]], Geoffrey von Cromvoirt was arrested by Aruban authorities on suspicion of criminal offenses related to [[illegal drug trade|dealing in illegal narcotics]] that, according to the prosecutor, might have been related to the disappearance of Holloway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=1849859 |title=Lawyer: Joran doesn't know man arrested in Holloway case |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2006-04-17 |publisher=ABC News}}</ref> At his first court appearance, his detention was extended for eight days.

At Aruba's request the Netherlands took over the investigation. A team of the Dutch National Police started work on the case in September 2006 following receipt of extensive case documentation in [[Rotterdam]].<ref name=KLPD>{{cite web|url=http://www.kparuba.com/newspages/persberichtNH28apr07.html|title=Gecombineerd rechercheteam onderzoekt vermissing Natalee Holloway|author=[[Korps landelijke politiediensten]] |language=Dutch}}</ref>  On [[April 16]], [[2007]], a combined Aruban-Dutch team began pursuing the investigation in Aruba.<ref name=KLPD/>

According to [[Jossy Mansur]], managing editor of Aruba's ''[[Diario (Aruba)|Diario]]'' newspaper, investigators were following up on statements made during early suspect interrogations regarding calls made and emails sent between the Kalpoe brothers and Joran van der Sloot.

On [[February 8]], [[2008]], Van der Sloot met with Aruban investigators in the Netherlands.  Van der Sloot denied that what he said on the tape was true, stating that he was under the influence of marijuana at the time.  Van der Sloot indicated that he still maintains that he left Holloway behind on the beach.<ref name=stoner>{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=4263979&page=1 |title=Investigators grill Joran van der Sloot |author=Chris Francescani |coauthors=Christine Brouwer |accessdate=2008-02-08 |year=2008 |date=2008-02-08 |publisher=ABC News}}</ref>

In March 2008, news reports indicated that the tables had been turned on Van der Eem, who himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for Aruban TV.  Van der Eem, under the impression that cameras had been turned off, kept talking.  Van der Eem disclosed that he had been a friend of Van der Sloot for years (contradicting his statement on the De Vries show that he had met Van der Sloot in 2007), that he expects to become a millionaire off his involvement in the Holloway case, and that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body<U+2014>and that Van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand [[euro]]s to buy the man's silence.  According to Dutch news service ANP, Van der Eem, who has already signed a book deal, "was furious" after learning of the taping, and "has threatened" the interviewer, who has sought legal advice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2008/03/friend_knows_who_dumped_natale.php |title='Friend' knows who dumped Natalee |accessdate=2008-02-11 |date=2008-03-07 |publisher=DutchNews.nl}}</ref>

The De Vries broadcast was discussed in a seminar by Dutch legal psychologist Willem Albert Wagenaar, who noted the material was not a confession. Wagenaar criticized De Vries for broadcasting the material, stating that the broadcast made it harder to obtain a conviction, and had De Vries turned over the material to the authorities without broadcasting it, they would have held "all the trumps" in questioning Van der Sloot. Mr. Wagenaar opined that not only is the case not solved, it is not even clear that a crime was committed. Professor Crisje Brants, in the same seminar, also criticized De Vries's methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/080211-holloway-legal-sloot |title=Holloway confession on TV: Trial by psychology |accessdate=2008-02-11 |date=2008-02-11 |publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide}}</ref>

==Beth Twitty's involvement==
Beth Twitty alleged in televised interviews that Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers know more than they have told, and that at least one of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter.<ref name="SheDid"/> Twitty has stated that she has received copies of police statements stating that Joran van der Sloot admitted having sex with Holloway at his home and described intimate details of her.

On [[June 12]], [[2005]], three days after the arrest of Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, and in response to a nationally-televised address by Aruba Prime Minister [[Nelson Oduber]] reaffirming Aruba's commitment to solving the case, Twitty stated, "I'm not getting any answers".<ref name=NotAnswers>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2005-06-12-aruba-teen_x.htm?POE=NEWISVA |title=Holloway's mother: Detainees know what happened to her |accessdate=2008-03-11 |date=2005-06-13 |publisher=''USA Today''}}</ref>  She added, "I don't feel any further along than the day I got here".<ref name=NotAnswers/>  Twitty subsequently stated that her complaints were not addressed specifically at the Aruban government, but arose from frustration at not knowing what happened to her daughter.<ref name=NotAnswers/>

On [[July 5]], [[2005]], following the initial release of the Kalpoes, Twitty alleged, "Two suspects were released yesterday who were involved in a violent crime against my daughter",<ref name = "demonstration">{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8484217/ |title=Some Arubans angry at Holloway<U+2019>s mom |accessdate=2008-03-08 |date=2005-06-06 |publisher=MSNBC}}</ref> and referred to the Kalpoes as "criminals".<ref name = "Demonstration1"/>  A demonstration involving about two hundred Arubans took place that evening outside the courthouse in Oranjestad in anger over Twitty's remarks, with signs reading "Innocent until proven guilty" and "Respect our Dutch laws or go home".<ref name=MomApolgizes>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/07/08/missing.aruba/index.html |title=Missing teen's mom apologizes for comments |accessdate=2007-12-23 |date=2005-07-08 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>  On [[July 8]], [[2005]], and after Satish Kalpoe's attorney threatened legal action over Twitty's allegations, which he described as "prejudicial, inflammatory, libelous, and totally outrageous",<ref name=MomApolgizes/> Twitty read a statement that said her remarks were fueled by "despair and frustration" and that she "apologize{{bracket|d}} to the Aruban people and to the Aruban authorities if I or my family offended you in any way".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/news/2005/0706/arubamother_ap.html |title=Mother of missing Ala. teen asks countries to deny freed brothers asylum |accessdate=2007-12-23 |date=2005-07-06 |publisher=CourtTV}}</ref> Subsequently, Twitty also based her allegations on the [[Natalee_Holloway#Skeeters_tape_and_Dr._Phil.3B_lawsuits|Skeeters tape]], indicating that she believes that Deepak Kalpoe answered affirmatively to the suggestion that all three had sex with Holloway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turnto23.com/news/5448056/detail.html |title=Beth Twitty responds to controversy over Kalpoe tape |accessdate=2008-02-24 |date=2005-12-02 |publisher=ABC - KERO TV}}</ref>

Twitty has been criticized for what is perceived as excessive focus on Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers, to the exclusion of any other theory as to what happened to Holloway. According to the lawsuit filed by the Kalpoe brothers, she has (on various television programs) repeatedly accused them, and Joran van der Sloot, of "sexual assault" and "gang rape" of her daughter.<ref name="KatrinaCloak"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-09-27-aruba-teen_x.htm |title=Man says he did not assault Holloway; teen's mom disagrees |accessdate=2008-03-08 |date=2005-09-27 |publisher=''USA Today''}}</ref> 

Twitty has also been criticized for making what have been deemed to be inconsistent and contradictory statements (for example, as to whether there were operating security cameras at the Holiday Inn).  According to Julia Renfro, U.S.-born owner of the Aruban tourist-oriented newspaper, ''Aruba Today'', who befriended Twitty in the early days of the investigation, Twitty pandered to tabloid TV and her "behavior was odd from the get-go".<ref name="MWWSLA"/> Renfro noted that "Twitty immediately concluded that her daughter had been kidnapped and made no effort to check hospitals or police",<ref name=Renfronoted/> adding that within a couple of days, after fixing responsibility on Joran van der Sloot, Twitty "was telling TV interviewers that she knew her daughter had been gang-raped and murdered".<ref name=Renfronoted>{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003741183_aruba09.html |title=As missing-teen case cools, Aruba turns against family |accessdate=2008-05-27 |date=2007-06-09 |publisher=''The Seattle Times''}}</ref>

Following the airing of the De Vries program, Beth Twitty, adhering to the position that the tapes represent the way events transpired, told the ''New York Post'' that she believes her daughter might still be alive if Van der Sloot had called for help.  She contends that Van der Sloot dumped Holloway's body, possibly alive, into the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,328629,00.html |title=Holloway's Anguished Mother: Tape Confession Means Natalee Could Have Been Saved |accessdate=2008-02-05 |date=2008-02-05 |publisher=FOXNews}}</ref>  Twitty also alleges that the individual Joran van der Sloot supposedly called that evening was his father, Paulus, who, according to Twitty, "orchestrated what to do next".<ref name=Deadlineclose>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc13.com/gulfcoastwest/vtm/news.apx.-content-articles-VTM-2008-02-12-0012.html |title=Deadline for Van der Sloot close, Natalee's parents worried strings being pulled |accessdate=2008-02-13 |date=2008-02-12 |publisher=NBC 13}}</ref>  She, and Dave Holloway, alleged that Joran van der Sloot was receiving "special legal favors".<ref name=Deadlineclose/>  After the court decision not to rearrest Van der Sloot was affirmed, Twitty stated, "I think that what I do take comfort in, his life is a living hell."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc13.com/gulfcoastwest/vtm/news.apx.-content-articles-VTM-2008-02-15-0020.html |title=Natalee Holloway's parents still have hope for justice |accessdate=2008-02-17 |date=2008-02-15 |publisher=NBC 13}}</ref>

In response to Holloway's disappearance, Twitty founded the International Safe Travels Foundation.<ref name=SeekDivorce/> The foundation is a non-profit organization, designed "to inform and educate the public to help them travel more safely as they travel internationally".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalsafetravelsfoundation.org/MS/MS37/page.php?p=418 |title=About ISTF: Our Mission |accessdate=2008-05-21 |publisher=The International Safe Travels Foundation}}</ref> Twitty is working with [[Auburn University]] to develop a curriculum that she hopes "will be the foremost authority on travel education".<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Kemp |title=From tragedy, one mother finds hope |publisher=''The Birmingham News'' |location=Birmingham |date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2008-05-21 }}</ref>

While initially the Twittys discouraged a travel boycott of Aruba, this changed by September 2005. Beth Twitty urged that persons not travel to Aruba because of what she stated were tourist safety issues.

Members of the Aruba Hotel and Tourism Association, the Aruba Tourism Authority, the Aruba Hospitality and Security Foundation, the Aruban Chamber of Commerce and government figures, including Public Relations Representative Ruben Trapenberg, formed an "Aruba Strategic Communications Task Force" to respond collectively to what they perceived to be unfounded and/or negative portrayals of the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aruba.com/holloway/taskforce.htm |title=The Strategic Communications Task Force |accessdate=2007-06-05 |year=2006 |month=April |publisher=Aruba.com |archivedate=April 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060422042748/http://www.aruba.com/holloway/taskforce.htm}}

===Skeeters tape and Dr. Phil; lawsuits===
On [[September 15]], [[2005]], the ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' television show showed parts of a hidden-camera interview with Deepak Kalpoe in which Kalpoe seems to answer "She did.

Despite an unsuccessful attempt by the Dr. Phil show to condition release of the tapes on Aruban authorities appearing on their show,<ref name = "dompigreaction"/> Aruban police and the FBI obtained the original of the tape, and provided copies to the media.

===''Amigoe'' article===
On [[July 3]] [[2007]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]] newspaper ''Amigoe'' reported on a documentary video being produced by Ren<U+00E9>e Gielen, previously best known for expos<U+00E9> documentaries about [[Curacao]]'s Bon Futuro prison. The video was based in part on interviews with Dompig and with Renfro.  

According to interviews done in preparation for the film, Aruban authorities had been systematically obstructed in their investigation by the FBI and other American authorities. They also indicate that within a day of Holloway being declared missing, a [[medjet]], unauthorized by Aruban authorities, had arrived on Aruba and had remained for several days.  They further indicate that, while the purpose of the medjet was not even known to its crew and medical personnel, it was in fact to spirit Holloway off the island if she were freed from a drug house in Oranjestad. Holloway's departure was to be covert and without notice to local authorities.<ref name = "Amigoe">{{cite news |title=The other side of the Holloway-case: <U+2018>Police Aruba hindered by FBI<U+2019> |date=2007-07-03 |publisher=''Amigoe''}}</ref>

The article states that Renfro and Beth Twitty received a phone call from an unknown woman on [[June 2]], [[2005]].  That woman was offering information about Holloway's location and the information that Holloway was still alive but was unwilling to return to her mother.  Further information was offered for $4,000.  Twitty was unwilling to pay more than $1,000 for the information, and in fact did not pay anything.  Believing there was a good chance of finding Holloway, Renfro and another American went to the drug house where Holloway supposedly was, bringing money.  However, they found that Jug Twitty had already been to the area, spreading "a lot of uproar and panic in the direct vicinity", and nothing could be accomplished.<ref name = "Amigoe"/>  They blamed Jug Twitty for the failure.<ref name = "Amigoe"/>  The same story, in less detail, appears in the ''Vanity Fair'' article.<ref name = "Vanity"/>

Further, according to Amigoe's report on the interviews, Aruban authorities were obstructed at the highest level in their attempts to investigate Holloway's relatives, and they received very limited cooperation in their attempts to question Holloway's fellow graduates.<ref name = "Amigoe"/>

==Media coverage==

[[List of United States broadcast television networks|U.S. television networks]] devoted much air time to the search for Holloway, the investigation of her disappearance, and rumors surrounding the case. [[Greta Van Susteren]], host of ''[[On the Record with Greta Van Susteren|On The Record]]'' on [[Fox News]], and Nancy Grace on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Headline News]]'' were among the most prominent television personalities to devote time to the incident. Van Susteren's almost continuous coverage of the story caused ''On The Record'' to get its best ratings to date,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/08/22/Worldandnation/From_paradise_to_para.shtml |title=From paradise to paradox in Aruba |accessdate=2008-05-04 |date=2005-08-22 |publisher=''St. Petersburg Times'' |quote=On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, who is averaging more than 2-million viewers a night, up almost 60 percent from a year ago.}}</ref> while Grace's show became the cornerstone of the new "Headline Prime" block on Headline News, which ran two episodes (a live show and a repeat) every night during prime-time. As the case wore on, much of the attention was given to Beth Twitty and her statements.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kosinski |first=Michelle |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9065827/ |title=How mom keeps spotlight on the Holloway case |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2005-08-24 |publisher=NBC News}}</ref> Aruban government spokesman Ruben Trapenberg stated, "The case is under a microscope, and the world is watching."<ref name = "lighton"/> Locally, the Aruban press published extensive news on the story in Dutch, English, and Papiamento.

The saturation of coverage triggered a backlash among some critics who believe that the extensive coverage of the Holloway case validates the theory known as [[missing white woman syndrome]], which argues that missing-person cases involving [[White (people)|white]] women and girls receive disproportionate attention in the media compared with cases involving males or non-white people. CNN ran a segment criticizing the amount of coverage their competitors gave to the story despite what they perceived to be a lack of new items to report, with CNN news anchor [[Anderson Cooper]] calling the coverage "downright ridiculous".<ref name="RidiculousCooper">{{cite web |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/11/acd.01.html |title=Anderson Cooper 360<U+00B0> - Transcript (Aired August 11, 2005 - 19:00 ET) |accessdate=2007-11-28 |date=2005-08-11 |quote=We decided to start tracking their coverage, because to be honest, it's getting downright ridiculous. - Cooper}}</ref>

Early in the case, political commentator and columnist [[Arianna Huffington]] wrote, "If you were to get your news only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba.  Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, [[Michael Jackson]], when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now we can get back to real news. But we never do."<ref name = "Overkill"/>

In March 2008, ''[[El Diario]]'' commented, "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing [[Latino|Latinas]], there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English-language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latina and African American women often remain faceless, when they are even covered."<ref name="Latin">{{cite news |title=Justice for Reyna Isabel |date=2008-03-17 |publisher= ''El Diario''}}</ref>

CBS senior journalist Danna Walker stated, "There is criticism that it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde<U+2013>and white <!-- punctuation of verbal quote corrected, original transcription is " ... because she is a pretty, blonde, and white ...  --><U+2013>and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories.  But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure, and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with."<ref name = "Overkill"/>

Holloway's family, though, instead criticized the lessening of coverage of the young woman's disappearance.  The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance by the American media was largely eclipsed in late August 2005 by [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name="KatrinaCloak">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc10.com/news/5032346/detail.html |title=Local Philanthropist Helping Mother Of Girl Missing In Aruba |accessdate=2008-02-04 |date=2005-09-25 |publisher=NBC10 |quote=I can't help but think, they were released under the cloak of Hurricane Katrina - Twitty}}</ref><ref name="DavesBook">{{cite book |title=''Aruba: The Tragic Untold Story of Natalee Holloway and Corruption in Paradise''  |last=Holloway |first=Dave  |coauthors=R.

Lamented Dave Holloway in his book,

<blockquote>
Hurricane Katrina had left the door open for the boys to be sent on their way with little publicity and few restrictions because it took the world's focus off of Natalee, but only for a brief time. The huge amount of publicity had waned and, during that time of quiet for us, Joran and the Kalpoe brothers were sent home. . . . All of the news shows that had followed our every move only a day before had now become fixated on the next big ratings grabber: the victims of Hurricane Katrina.<ref name="DavesBook"/>
</blockquote> However, the deadline for judicial review of Joran van der Sloot's detention was set long before the hurricane.<ref name="timeline1"/>
