== Biography ==

Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre was born in an aristocratic family, the descendant of Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois Durand, lord of Grossouvre (1735-1832) <ref>Genealogy available [http://www.annales.org/archives/x/durand3.html here]</ref>. His father, a banker, died in 1923 in [[Beyrouth]] where he resided. Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre would keep affective ties to [[Lebanon]] hereafter. He then studied with the [[Jesuits]] in France and studied medicine.

During [[World War II]], Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre was affected as auxiliary physician in a regiment of Moroccan ''[[tirailleurs]]'', and then joined the ski troops in the [[Vercors]] region. There he met Captain Bousquet, who created one of the first units of the ''[[Organisation de r<U+00E9>sistance de l'arm<U+00E9>e]]'' (ORA). He then returned to Lyon, where he received his doctorate in 1942. Afterward, he became doctor of the 11th regiment of [[Cuirassier]]s, headed by Colonel Lormeau <ref>See [[Paul Barril]], ''Guerres secr<U+00E8>tes <U+00E0> l'<U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>e''.</ref>. 

Grossouvre then became a member of [[Joseph Darnand]]'s ''[[Service d'ordre l<U+00E9>gionnaire]]'' (SOL), a [[Vichy regime|Vichyst]] militia. He then left it in [[1943]] to fight in the Vercors, joining the [[Maquis]] of the Chartreuse, near [[Grenoble]] (code-name "Clober"). After the Liberation, it was found that he had in fact infiltrated the SOL on behalf of ORA. 

Grossouvre was then recruited in 1950 by the French [[SDECE]] intelligence agency to replace Gilbert Union, official in Lyon and who had worked with the military agency [[Bureau Central de Renseignement et d'Action|BCRA]], and became leader of ''Arc-en-Ciel'', the regional branch of [[Gladio]] ([[Lyon]] region), NATO's stay-behind anti-communist organizations during the Cold War, under the code-name "Monsieur Leduc" <ref name="Voltaire"> [http://www.voltairenet.org/article1285.html Grossouvre (Fran<U+00E7>ois de)], ''[[Voltaire Network]]'', December 15, 1998 {{fr icon}} </ref> <ref> [http://www.amnistia.net/librairi/amnistia/n13/tempsol.htm Du Temple Solaire au r<U+00E9>seau Gladio, en passant par Politica Hermetica...], [[Didier Daeninckx]] in ''Amnistia.net'', February 27, 2002 {{fr icon}} </ref>. According to former SDECE agent Louis Mouchon, "His business, the A. Berger et Cie Sugar company, offered ample opportunities to stage fronts. He really had excellent contacts." According to ''[[The Economist]]'s obituary, 
"He was recruited into the French espionage service and helped to organise Gladio, an American backed plan to create an armed resistance movement in Western Europe against a Russian invasion." 

Created by colonel Fourcaud, in liaison with the [[United States National Security Council|US National Security Council]], and then by Grossouvre, this network allegedly used the [[Service d'Action Civique|SAC]] Gaullist militia and the [[Department Protection-Security|DPS]], the [[National Front (France)|National Front]]'s currently dissolved militia <ref> [http://www.voltairenet.org/article791.html Gladio toujours], ''[[Voltaire Network]]'', October 1, 1999 {{fr icon}} </ref>. The DPS was created along with [[Jacques Foccart]], after the 1982 dissolution of the SAC, and allegedly provided mercenaries for activities in the former French colonies in Africa <ref> [http://www.voltairenet.org/article7597.html Le 21 avril 2002 n<U+2019>a pas <U+00E9>t<U+00E9> marqu<U+00E9> par une pouss<U+00E9>e du FN, "Pourra-t-on <U+00E9>touffer longtemps le nouveau clivage politique ?"], ''[[Voltaire Network]]'', May 4, 2002 {{fr icon}} </ref>.

He met [[Pierre Mend<U+00E8>s France]] during the war, on a [[bomber]]. Mend<U+00E8>s France who would later introduce him to [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]].

== Industrial activities ==

In 1943 he married Claudette Berger, daughter of an industrial, Antoiner Berger, and had six children. Grossouvre would lead his family-in-law's societies ''Le Bon sucre'' (1944-63) and ''A. Berger et Cie'' (1949-63), and then founded the ''G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale Sucri<U+00E8>re'' sugar company. Along with Italian collaborators, business man Gilbert Beaujolin and the American  Alexandre Patty, succeeds in obtaining an exclusive production licence for [[Coca Cola]] and building the first factory of this type in France. The distribution is assured by the ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> parisienne de boisons gazeuses'' and the ''Glaci<U+00E8>res de Paris'', both subsidiaries of [[Pastis Pernod]] <ref> [http://www.voltairenet.org/article8691.html#nh27 Note 27, Stay-behind : les r<U+00E9>seaux d<U+2019>ing<U+00E9>rence am<U+00E9>ricains], ''[[Voltaire Network]]'', August 20, 2001 {{fr icon}} </ref>

Besides this industrial activity, Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre was counsellor for foreign trade of France (1952-67) and vice-president of the ''Chambre de commerce franco-sarroise'' (1955-62). He invested some capital in the 1953 creation of ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' magazine, and would build during this occasion a friendship with [[Fran<U+00E7>oise Giroud]] and [[Jean-Jacques Servan Schreiber]]. Grossouvre becomes in the 1970s the largest shareholder of ''[[La Montagne (newspaper)|La Montagne]]'' and the ''[[Le Journal du Centre|Journal du Centre]]'' regional dailies.

== Relations with Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand ==

Grossouvre became a friend of Mitterrand during a travel to [[China]] in 1959, and participated to the [[Convention des institutions r<U+00E9>publicaines]] (CIR), a party created by Mitterrand in 1964, and which dissolved itself at the 1971 [[Epinay Congress]] of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (PS). He was part of the triumvirate which presided the ''[[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration de la Gauche D<U+00E9>mocrate Socialiste]]'' (FGDS) party directed by Mitterrand, who charged him, besides other things, of the negotiations with the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (PCF). In 1974, Grossouvre became the [[godparent|godfather]] of [[Mazarine Pingeot]], Mitterrand's daughter, whose existence was dissimulated until the 1990s  <ref name="Voltaire"> [http://www.voltairenet.org/article1285.html Grossouvre (Fran<U+00E7>ois de)], ''[[Voltaire Network]]'', December 15, 1998 {{fr icon}} </ref> <ref> [http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/dossier/mitt/dossier.asp?ida=435095 La seconde famille de Mitterrand - Derniers secrets], ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', September 29, 2005 {{fr icon}} </ref>.

Grossouvre participated in all of Mitterrand's campaigns, starting from [[French presidential election, 1965|1965]] with the CIR, to the last one in [[French presidential election,1988|1988]] (and [[French presidential election, 1974|1974]] as well as [[French presidential election, 1981|1981]]). He followed Mitterrand to the [[Elys<U+00E9>e Palace]] in 1981, named in June ''charg<U+00E9> de mission'' (operations manager) and then ''conseiller du pr<U+00E9>sident'' (counsellor of the president)  of President Mitterrand, who confied him security and other sensible matters, in particular related to Lebanon, Syria, Tunisia, Morocco, Gabon, Gulf countries, Pakistan and both Coreas. He traveled a lot, in particular to Arabs countries where he worked in [[arms trade]]. His relations with the [[Gemayel]] and Syrian president [[Hafez el Assad]] helped him assist in the negotiations for French hostages in the mid-1980s <ref name="Necro"> [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-08/1994-04-08-698036  Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre se donne la mort <U+00E0> l<U+2019>Elys<U+00E9>e], ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', April 8, 1994 {{fr icon}} </ref>.

Grossouvre cumulated these functions with the presidency of the ''Comit<U+00E9> des chasses pr<U+00E9>sidentielles'' (Committee of Presidential Hunts), in charge of the hunting domains of the presidency. He would keep this function until his death, and used the domains for informal meetings  <ref name="Voltaire"> [http://www.voltairenet.org/article1285.html Grossouvre (Fran<U+00E7>ois de)], ''[[Voltaire Network]]'', December 15, 1998 {{fr icon}} </ref><ref name="Necro"> [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-08/1994-04-08-698036  Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre se donne la mort <U+00E0> l<U+2019>Elys<U+00E9>e], ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', April 8, 1994 {{fr icon}} </ref>.

According to ''[[Le Figaro]]'', the decision to [[sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sink the Rainbow Warrior]] on July 10, 1985 was taken in a June metting at the Elys<U+00E9>e Palace, attended by [[Charles Hernu]], minister of Defense, Admiral Lacoste and Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre <ref name="Bio"> [http://home.planet.nl/~reijd050/organisations/Le_Cercle_membership_list.htm Grossouvre biography], from Brian Cozier, ''Free Agent'', 1993, and Daniele Ganser, 'NATO's Secret Armies: [[Operation Gladio]] and Terrorism in Western Europe', Franck Cass, London, 2005 p. 90-91 </ref> <ref> [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0061FF9385D0C758CDDA90994DD484D81 'Greenpeace ship reaches test site'], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 6, 1985: "Mr. Mitterrand's Socialist Government acknowledged secret service responsibility for the sinking last month. Defense Minister Charles Hernu and Adm. Pierre Lacoste, the head of the secret service, resigned because of the scandal. Le Figaro, without citing its sources, said the decision to mine the Rainbow Warrior was made in June in a meeting at the Elysee Palace attended by Mr. Hernu, Admiral Lacoste and the presidential adviser, Francois de Grossouvre. It was ''not believable'' that Mr. de Grossouvre failed to inform Mr. Mitterrand of the sabotage plans, Le Figaro contended." </ref>

In July 1985, he officially ended his functions as adviser to the president, and worked as an international counsellor for arms-trader [[Marcel Dassault]] (1986-86) <ref> [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-11/1994-04-11-698181 Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre inhum<U+00E9> aujourd'hui], ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', April 11, 1994 {{fr icon}} </ref> <ref name="Necro"> [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-08/1994-04-08-698036  Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre se donne la mort <U+00E0> l<U+2019>Elys<U+00E9>e], ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', April 8, 1994 {{fr icon}} </ref>. He nevertheless kept his office at the Elys<U+00E9>e, his flat on the [[Quai Branly]], a secretary and bodyguards from the [[GIGN]], with the corresponding budget, although he began to take some distances with Mitterrand (and increasingly opposed himself to [[Gilles M<U+00E9>nage (politician)|Gilles M<U+00E9>nage]], other advisor for the President). Grossouvre was nicknamed by some "L'Homme de l'ombre" (The Man of the Shadows) <ref>[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/1994-04-08/1994-04-08-698082 Suicide de Fran<U+00E7>ois de Grossouvre], ''[[L'Humanit<U+00E9>]]'', April 8, 1994 {{fr icon}}</ref> <ref name="NYT"> [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9D02E4DD133EF931A25757C0A962958260  French Ask If Suicide Was Message To Mitterrand], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 12, 1994 </ref>.

== Death ==

Grossouvre allegedly committed suicide on [[April 7]], [[1994]], although some, such as Captain [[Paul Barril]], claimed that he had been murdered <ref> [http://survie67.free.fr/Rwanda/Divers/attentat-questions.htm April 6, 1994 attack], ''[[Survie NGO|Survie]]'' [[Alsace]] {{fr icon}} </ref>. He was discovered dead, two bullets in his head, in his office at the Elys<U+00E9>e &mdash; several hours after the assassination of Rwandan president [[Juv<U+00E9>nal Habyarimana]]. Barril, who worked in [[Rwanda]], presented himself in his book ''Guerres secr<U+00E8>tes <U+00E0> l<U+2019><U+00C9>lys<U+00E9>e'' (Secret Wars in the Elys<U+00E9>e) as an "intime" of Grossouvre <ref name="Survie"> [http://www.survie-france.org/IMG/rtf/CEC_resume_mardi_23.rtf Commission d<U+2019>Enqu<U+00EA>te Citoyenne sur le r<U+00F4>le de la France durant le g<U+00E9>nocide au Rwanda], [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Xavier Verschave]], ''[[Survie NGO|Survie]]'' </ref>.

The "hurt friend" of Mitterrand according to ''[[Le Monde]]'' daily, Grossouvre voluntarily gave evidence to a judge investigating the case of Roger-Patrice Pelat, a businessman who reportedly financed many of Mitterrand's political campaigns and who was facing charges of insider trading when he died of natural causes in 1989. <ref name="NYT"/>

Grossouvres's funeral took place on [[April 11]], [[1994]] at [[Saint-Pierre de Moulins]] ([[Allier]]) church. Among the 400 persons assembled were president Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand, former Lebanese president [[Amin Gemayel]], diplomatic representatives from Morocco and Pakistan, and former socialist ministers [[Pierre Joxe]], [[Louis Mexandeau]] and [[Ren<U+00E9> Souchon]].
