'''Julius Rosenberg''' ([[May 12]] [[1918]] <U+2013> [[June 19]] [[1953]]) and '''Ethel Greenglass Rosenberg''' ([[September 25]] [[1915]] <U+2013> [[June 19]] [[1953]]) were [[United States|American]] [[Communist Party USA|Communists]] who received international attention when they were executed for passing [[nuclear weapon]]s secrets to the [[Soviet Union]].

In the 1990s, Soviet communications decrypted in the [[VENONA project]] were released, which supported the general allegations of espionage by Julius, though not supporting the specific charges on which the Rosenbergs were convicted. Also supporting the conviction were Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s posthumously published memoirs.

== Background ==
Julius Rosenberg was born to a [[Jew]]ish family on [[May 12]], [[1918]] in [[New York City]]. He became a leader in the [[Young Communist League]] where, in 1936, he met Ethel, whom he married three years later.
He graduated from the [[City College of New York]] with a degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1939 and in 1940 joined the [[Army Signal Corps]], where he worked on [[radar]] equipment.

Ethel Greenglass was born on [[September 28]], 1915, in [[New York City]], also to a Jewish family. She was an aspiring actress and singer, but eventually took a secretarial job at a shipping company. She became involved in labor disputes and joined the [[Young Communist League]], where she first met Julius. The Rosenbergs had two sons named Robert and Michael.

According to his former [[KGB]] handler, [[Alexander Feklisov]], Julius Rosenberg was originally recruited by the KGB on [[Labor Day]] 1942, by former KGB spymaster [[Semyon Semenov]].<ref name="Feklisov">{{cite book|last=Feklisov|first=Aleksandr|coauthors=Kostin, Sergei|title=The Man Behind the Rosenbergs|publisher=Enigma books|year=2001|id=ISBN 1-929631-08-1}}</ref> Julius had been introduced to Semenov by Bernard Schuster, a high ranking member of the Communist Party USA as well as [[Earl Browder|Earl Browder's]] personal KGB liaison. After Semenov was recalled to Moscow in 1944, his duties were taken over by his apprentice, Alexander Feklisov.<ref name="Feklisov"/>

According to Feklisov, Julius was his most dedicated and valuable asset, providing thousands of classified reports from [[Emerson Electric Company|Emerson Radio]], including a complete [[proximity fuze]], the same design that was used to shoot down [[Francis Gary Powers|Francis Gary Powers's]] [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] in 1960. Under Feklisov administration, Julius Rosenberg is said to have recruited sympathetic individuals to the KGB<U+2019>s service, including [[Joel Barr]], [[Al Sarant]], [[William Perl]] and [[Morton Sobell]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Feklisov|first=Aleksandr|coauthors=Kostin, Sergei|title=The Man Behind the Rosenbergs|publisher=Enigma books|year=2001|id=ISBN 1-929631-08-1|pages=140-147}}</ref>

According to Feklisov's account, he was supplied by Perl, under Julius Rosenberg<U+2019>s direction, with thousands of documents from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics including a complete set of design and production drawings for the [[P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed's P-80 Shooting Star]]. Feklisov says he learned through Julius that his brother-in-law David Greenglass was working on the top secret Manhattan Project at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], and used Julius to recruit him.<ref name="Feklisov"/>

During [[World War II]], the USSR and the U.S. became allies in war, but the U.S. government was highly suspicious of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s intentions. As such, the Americans did not share information or seek assistance from the Soviet Union for the [[Manhattan Project]]. However, the Soviets were aware of the project as a result of espionage penetration of the U.S. government and had made a number of attempts to infiltrate its operations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. A number of project members <U+2014> some high-profile, others lower in rank <U+2014> did voluntarily give secret information to Soviet agents, many because they were sympathetic to communism {{Fact|date=February 2007}} (or the Soviet Union's role in the war) and did not feel that the U.S. should have a monopoly on atomic weapons<ref>See Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstell, ''Bombshell'', Times Books, 1997 (ISBN 0-8129-2861-X) with reference to [[Theodore Alvin Hall]] and [[Saville Sax]] and their motives.</ref>

After the war, the U.S. continued to resist efforts to share nuclear secrets, but the Soviet Union was able to produce its own atomic weapons by 1949. Its first [[nuclear test]], "[[Joe 1]]", shocked the West in the speed it was produced. It was then discovered in January 1950 that [[Klaus Fuchs]], a German refugee theoretical physicist working for the British mission in the Manhattan Project, had given key documents to the Russians throughout the war. Through Fuchs' confession, U.S. and UK intelligence agents were able to make a case against his "courier", [[Harry Gold]], who was arrested on [[May 23]], [[1950]]. A former machinist at the top-secret [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos laboratory]], Sgt. [[David Greenglass]], confessed to having passed secret information on to the USSR through Gold as well. Though he initially denied any involvement by his sister, Ethel Rosenberg, he claimed that her husband, Julius, had convinced his wife to recruit him while on a visit to him in Albuquerque, N.M. in 1944 and that Julius had also passed secrets. Another accused conspirator, [[Morton Sobell]], was on vacation in [[Mexico City]], when both Rosenbergs were arrested. According to his version published in ''On Doing Time'', he tried to figure out a way to get to Europe without a passport but ultimately abandoned that effort and was back in Mexico City when he was kidnapped by members of the Mexican Secret Police and driven to the U.S. border where he was arrested. The government claimed he had been deported but in 1956 the Mexican government officially declared that he had never been deported. Regardless of how he was returned to the U.S., he was arrested and stood trial with the Rosenbergs on one count of conspiracy to commit espionage.

== Trial and conviction ==
[[Image:Julius Rosenberg mugshot.png|right|thumb|292px|Police photograph of Julius Rosenberg after his arrest.]]

[[Image:Ethel Rosenberg mugshot.png|right|thumb|300px|Mugshot of Ethel Rosenberg.]]

The case against the Rosenbergs and Sobell began on [[March 6]], [[1951]]. The prosecution's primary witness, David Greenglass, stated that his sister Ethel typed notes containing U.S. nuclear secrets in the Rosenberg apartment in September 1945. He also asserted that a sketch he made of a cross section of the implosion-type atom bomb (the one dropped on [[Nagasaki]] as opposed to the "gun method" triggering device that was in the one dropped on [[Hiroshima]]) was also turned over to Julius Rosenberg at that meeting.

From the beginning, the trial attracted a high amount of media attention, but unlike the trial of [[Alger Hiss]], there was no polarized response from observers.  Aside from the Rosenbergs' own defense during the trial, there was not one single public expression of doubt as to their guilt in any media (even the left-wing and Communist Press) before and during the trial.  The first break in the media unanimity would not occur until August of 1951 when a series of articles ran in the independent left wing newspaper ''The National Guardian''.  Only after the publication of those articles was a defense committee formed.

Although the notes allegedly typed by Ethel apparently contained little that was relevant to the Soviet atomic bomb project, this was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict on the conspiracy to commit espionage charge.  

It is believed that part of the reason Ethel was indicted along with Julius was so that the prosecution could use her as a 'lever' to pressure Julius into giving up the names of others who were involved.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Sam|title=The Brother: The Untold Story of the Rosenberge Case|publisher=Random House|year=2001|id=ISBN 0-375-76124-1|pages=425-426,432}}</ref> If that was the case, it did not work. On the witness stand, Julius asserted his right under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to not incriminate himself whenever asked about his involvement in the [[Communist Party]] or with its members. Ethel did similarly. Neither defendant was viewed sympathetically by the jury.

The role played by Assistant United States Attorney [[Roy Cohn]], the prosecutor in the case, is controversial, since Cohn stated in his autobiography that he influenced the selection of the judge, and pushed him to impose the [[death penalty]] on both Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.

The Rosenbergs were convicted on [[March 29]], [[1951]], and on [[April 5]] were sentenced to death by Judge [[Irving Kaufman]] under section 2 of the [[Espionage Act]], 50 ''[[U.S. Code]]'' 32 (now 18 ''U.S. Code'' 794), which prohibits transmitting or attempting to transmit to a foreign government information "relating to the national defense." The conviction helped to fuel Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s investigations into anti-American activities by U.S. citizens. While their devotion to the Communist cause was well documented, the Rosenbergs denied the espionage charges even as they faced the [[electric chair]].

The couple were the only two American civilians to be executed for espionage-related activity during the [[Cold War]]. In imposing the death penalty, Judge Kaufman noted that he held them responsible not only for espionage but also for the deaths of the [[Korean War]]:

{{cquote|''I consider your crime worse than murder...I believe your conduct in putting into the hands of the Russians the A-Bomb years before our best scientists predicted Russia would perfect the bomb has already caused, in my opinion, the Communist aggression in Korea, with the resultant casualties exceeding 50,000 and who knows but that millions more of innocent people may pay the price of your treason. Indeed, by your betrayal you undoubtedly have altered the course of history to the disadvantage of our country. No one can say that we do not live in a constant state of tension. We have evidence of your treachery all around us every day for the civilian defense activities throughout the nation are aimed at preparing us for an atom bomb attack.''<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/rosenb/ROS_SENT.HTM Judge Kaufman's Statement Upon Sentencing the Rosenbergs] on the site of the [[University of Kansas City-Missouri]] School of Law. Accessed 28 September 2006.</ref>}}

Their case has been at the center of the controversy over communism in the United States ever since, with supporters steadfastly maintaining that their conviction was an egregious example of persecution typical of the "hysteria" of those times (see [[McCarthyism]]) and likening it to the witch hunts that marred [[Salem witch trials|Salem]] and medieval Europe (a comparison that provided the inspiration for [[Arthur Miller]]'s critically acclaimed play, ''[[The Crucible]]'').

After the publication of the series in ''The National Guardian'' and the formation of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, some Americans came to believe both Rosenbergs were innocent or received too harsh a punishment{{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}}, and a grass-roots campaign was started to try to stop the couple's execution. Other Americans felt{{Views needing attribution|date=May 2007}} that the couple got what they deserved. [[Pope Pius XII]] appealed to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] to spare the couple{{Fact|date=May 2007}}, but he refused on [[February 11]], [[1953]], and all other appeals were also unsuccessful.[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040806.html]

== Execution ==
The couple were executed at sundown in the [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing]] in Westchester County, New York, on June 19, 1953 (Delayed from the originally scheduled date of June 18 because on June 17, [[Justice William O. Douglas]] had granted a stay of execution). On June 18, the Supreme Court was called back into special session to dispose of Douglas' stay rather than let the execution be delayed for months while the appeal that was the basis of the stay wended its way through the lower courts. The Court did not vacate Douglas's stay until noon on Friday, June 19. Thus, the execution then was scheduled for later in the evening after the start of the Jewish Sabbath. Desperately playing for more time, their lawyer, Emanuel Bloch, filed a complaint that this offended their Jewish heritage <U+2014> so the execution was scheduled before sunset. Reports of the execution state that Julius died after the first application of electricity, but Ethel did not succumb immediately and was subjected to two more electrical charges before being pronounced dead. The chair was designed for a man of average size; and Ethel Rosenberg was a petite woman: this discrepancy resulted, it is claimed, in the electrodes fitting poorly and making poor electrical contact. Eyewitness testimony (as given by a newsreel report featured in The Atomic Cafe) describes smoke rising from her head.

Ethel and Julius Rosenberg are interred at Wellwood Cemetery in Pinelawn (Suffolk County), New York.

== Posthumous revelations ==
In 1995, the [[National Security Agency]] publicly released documents from the [[VENONA]] project, an effort to decrypt intercepted communications between Soviet agents and the [[NKVD]]/[[KGB]]. A 1944 cable from New York to Moscow clearly indicates that a spy with the code named ANTENNA and later LIBERAL who the FBI later decided was Julius Rosenberg was engaged in espionage for the Soviet Union, though the importance of the activities of LIBERAL/ANTENNA is not clear, particularly considering that the Soviets were receiving information on the atomic bomb from [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]] and [[Theodore Hall|Theodore Alvin Hall]]. From the [[VENONA]] transcripts alone, one could make a strong case that Ethel was never a spy. A document from [[November 27]], [[1944]] [https://www.cia.gov/csi/books/venona/b73.gif] specifically about "LIBERAL's wife" who is identified with the first name, Ethel, lists her as a "fellow countryman" and claims that she was aware of Julius's work.  "LIBERAL's wife" Ethel was never assigned a code name <U+2014> the only reference to her states she "does not work."  Meredith Gardner, the Russian linguist who worked intensely on the [[VENONA]] decryptions was quoted as saying that the work statement indicates that "LIBERAL's WIFE," Ethel was not an espionage agent.  Julius was always referred to as "ANTENNA" or "LIBERAL" never by his own name <U+2014> which has led some to doubt that the FBI's connection of "LIBERAL" to Julius Rosenberg was accurate but the preponderance of opinion is that LIBERAL/ANTENNA does refer to Julius Rosenberg.

In his [[memoirs]], published posthumously in 1990, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] praised the pair for their "very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb." Whether this was in fact the case, however, has been disputed.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9703/16/rosenbergs/|title=KGB agent says Rosenbergs were executed unjustly|accessdate=2006-09-25|date=1997-03-06}}</ref> 

Faced with the [[VENONA]] transcripts and periodic revelations from former Soviet intelligence officials and archives, most critiques of the Rosenbergs' prosecution today centers on the usefulness of classified nuclear information allegedly provided by Julius Rosenberg and David Greenglass to the Soviet Union, the severity of their punishment, and the fact that not all Soviet spies were caught, and not all who were caught were prosecuted by the U.S. government. The atom bomb information which Greenglass claimed to have given to the Soviets appears to have been quite poor in comparison to the information given by Fuchs, who had a much more intimate understanding of the research being done (revealed by records of Fuchs' detailed transmissions in selective releases from Soviet archives) and a much more sophisticated theoretical understanding of the mechanisms of the bomb. There was also significant information provided independently of Fuchs by the young scientist [[Theodore Alvin Hall]], as well as potentially more agents, the identities of whom have not yet been fully established.

Fuchs's data were the most valuable of all the Soviet [[atomic spies]], giving a range of specific information on everything from nuclear physics details, production of the plants for uranium enrichment, and the exact values for the bomb design itself.<ref>The content and value of Fuchs's data for the Soviet program is discussed thoroughly in David Holloway's, ''Stalin and the bomb: The Soviet Union and Atomic Energy, 1939<U+2013>1956'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1994). Holloway based his assessment of the value of Fuchs's data in particular from the intelligence transcripts and the reactions of key Soviet personnel <U+2014> especially [[Igor Kurchatov]] <U+2014> to Fuchs' data. The exact use of espionage information by the Soviets was somewhat complicated, due to mutual distrust of the espionage data and the Soviet scientists themselves by Stalin and Beria: see [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] for more information.</ref> However, it was standard Soviet intelligence policy to use several intelligence sources if at all possible, as any information Greenglass provided could serve as a control to check the accuracy of other intelligence.<ref name="Feklisov"/>  Many have responded that since Greenglass's information was not only crude but contained inaccuracies, it wouldn't even have confirmatory value.  See, for example, THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY REVISITED, SCIENCE AND SOCIETY, Vol 44, No. 1 (Spring, 1980): 1-28 (by Michael Meeropol and Gerald Markowitz)

[[David Greenglass]] was spared execution in exchange for his testimony. More importantly, his wife, who according to the Venona decrypts was given a code name, was never even indicted. He spent 10 years in prison and was released in 1960, and has lived under an assumed name since his release. Decades later, in late 1996, Greenglass recanted and claimed that he had committed [[perjury]] when he testified about the typing activity of his sister Ethel. Greenglass said he chose to falsely testify against his sister in order to protect his wife and children.

== Controversy ==
The Rosenberg case has always been a controversial issue, with opinion dividing along ideological lines. There are a number of points of contention that still hold, even after the [[VENONA]] revelations.
*'''Ethel Rosenberg<U+2019>s Involvement:''' While the preponderance of evidence indicates that Julius was involved in [[Soviet]] [[espionage]], the record is unclear for Ethel. The [[VENONA]] transcripts taken at face value indicate no involvement by Ethel, and her brother, David Greenglass, a key prosecution witness, later told his biographer Sam Roberts that he had perjured himself to lessen his own sentence and to help his wife avoid jail time. [http://english.pravda.ru/world/2001/12/06/23023.html]
*'''The Trial:''' There are many experts who have alleged that the political air of the time, and the documented pre-trial beliefs of [[Irving_Kaufman|Judge Kaufman]] made it nearly impossible for the Rosenbergs to have had a fair trial by an impartial jury. The Rosenberg lawyer, Emanuel Bloch, also made a number of massive legal blunders (such as moving to impound Exhibit 8 <U+2014> a Greenglass sketch purporting to show a cross section of the implosion-type [[atom bomb]], thereby in effect acquiescing in the prosecution's charge that the sketch was in fact the "secret of the atom bomb" and also not cross-examining [[Harry Gold]], who in later trials was found to be highly unreliable) suggesting either his incompetence or inability to cope with such a high-profile trial. Also, prosecutor [[Roy Cohn]] influenced the choice of [[Irving_Kaufman|Kaufman]] as judge.
*'''The Sentence:''' The imposition of the death sentence upon the Rosenbergs has been the most controversial aspect of the case, as they were sentenced far more harshly than any other "atomic spies." [[Klaus Fuchs]], who spied for many more years than the Rosenbergs, provided far more sensitive nuclear information to the Soviet Union, and was caught, confessed, tried, convicted, and sentenced in the [[United Kingdom]], received 14 years in jail, which was the maximum penalty in that nation for passing military secrets to friendly nations. In 1950 the Rosenbergs' conspiracy charge was prosecuted in the United States in the context of the [[Cold War]] and the concurrent [[Korean War]], with [[Irving_Kaufman|Judge Kaufman]] placing culpability on the couple for the [[Korean War]]. It is not clear that the prosecution proved that the Rosenbergs' activities had caused the [[Korean War]], even if they had given the [[Soviet Union]] the secret of the [[atomic bomb]].

== The Rosenbergs' children ==
The Rosenbergs' two sons, [[Robert Meeropol|Robert]] and [[Michael Meeropol|Michael]], were orphaned by the execution, and no relatives dared adopt them for fear of [[ostracism]] or worse. They were finally adopted by the songwriter [[Abel Meeropol]] and his wife Anne. Abel Meeropol (under the pen name of Lewis Allan) wrote the classic anti-lynching anthem "[[Strange Fruit]]," made famous by singer [[Billie Holiday]]. He also co-wrote (with Earl Robinson) "The House I Live In", made famous in a short film starring Frank Sinatra to promote the war effort under a theme of tolerance for all types of Americans. (This song has a line referring to "My neighbors black and white," which was omitted from the film and Frank Sinatra's recorded versions. In the film all the characters, even the members of Sinatra's band are white.) Robert and Michael co-wrote a book about the experience, ''We are Your Sons: The Legacy of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg'' (1975), and Robert wrote another book in 2004, ''An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey''. In 1990, Robert founded the [[Rosenberg Fund for Children]], a non-profit foundation that provides support for children whose parents are [[Leftist]] activists involved in court cases.

Michael's daughter, [[Ivy Meeropol]], directed a 2004 documentary about her grandparents, ''Heir to an Execution'', which was featured at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].
