'''''Lost in Translation''''' is a [[2003 in film|2003]] comedy-drama film starring [[Bill Murray]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. It was the second feature film written and directed by [[Sofia Coppola]], after ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]''. It was nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Bill Murray, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Sofia Coppola. Coppola won [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]].

Superficially, ''Lost in Translation'' is a movie about [[culture shock]]. The film explores these themes against the background of the modern [[Japan]]ese cityscape.

==Plot==
Aging movie star Bob Harris ([[Bill Murray]]) has arrived in [[Tokyo]] to film a [[Suntory]] whisky advert (a reference to real-life [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actors who do [[foreign celebrity advertising]], including Sofia Coppola's father, [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who did Suntory commercials with [[Akira Kurosawa]] during the filming of ''[[Kagemusha]]''<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz7fQCE_icU&eurl= 1980s Suntory Whisky Advertisements.]</ref>). 

Charlotte ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) is the young wife of a celebrity photographer on assignment in Tokyo. Left behind by her husband when he goes to his photo shoots, she is unsure of her present and her future and about the man she has married. Bob's relationship with his wife of 25 years is clearly tired and lacking in romance, as revealed in his telephone calls back to the US. Bob and Charlotte, both lonely and directionless, meet in the bar of the hotel where they are both staying and strike up a friendship. The two explore Tokyo together, experiencing the differences between Japanese and American culture. The two grow close through their adventures and the time they spend together when neither can sleep.

On the penultimate night of his stay, Bob attracts the attention of the resident vocalist of the hotel bar. The next morning, Bob awakens to find this woman in his room and Charlotte waiting for him. The pair have a brief conflict when they later meet at a restaurant, seemingly over Bob's sleeping with this other woman. Later that night, during a fire alarm, they reconcile and express how they will miss each other. 

On the morning of his departure, as Bob is in his taxi to the airport, he sees Charlotte on a crowded street. He asks his driver to stop, gets out, and pursues Charlotte. When he reaches her, the two face each other for a long moment and then embrace. Bob whispers something in the tearful Charlotte's ear, kisses her, and then departs. The movie ends without resolving whether their relationship will continue.

=== Parting words ===
In the film's final scene, Bob whispers something to Charlotte and kisses her, actions that were not in the script. The actors and Sofia Coppola have refused to disclose in interviews what Bob says. Some fans and professionals (such as the BBC) have attempted to decipher the quote, but there is no consensus on what is said.

== Lost in translation ==
The concept of "lost in translation" occurs throughout the film with a number of meanings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6DD103AF932A1575AC0A9659C8B63 |title=What Else Was Lost in Translation |accessdate=2007-11-04 |last=Rich |first=Motoko |date=[[2003-09-21]] |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote= It doesn't take much to figure out that "Lost in Translation," the title of Sofia Coppola's elegiac new film about two lonely American souls in Tokyo, means more than one thing. There is the cultural dislocation felt by Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a washed-up movie actor, and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young wife trying to find herself. They are also lost in their marriages, lost in their lives. Then, of course, there is the simple matter of language.}}</ref>  Bob ([[Bill Murray]]), a Japanese director ([[Diamond Yukai|Yutaka Tadokoro]]), and an interpreter (Takeshita) are on a set, filming the whisky commercial.  The audience witnesses several exchanges in which the director speaks several long sentences, with passion, followed by a brief, pithy translation from the interpreter. The scene (like all the film's Japanese dialogue) is played without subtitles, so that viewers who do not speak Japanese feel quite as lost as Bob does.

:'''Director''' [in Japanese, to the interpreter]: The translation is very important, O.K.? The translation.
:'''Interpreter''' [in Japanese, to the director]: Yes, of course. I understand.
:'''Director''' [in Japanese, to Bob] Mr. Bob. You are sitting quietly in your study. And then there is a bottle of Suntory whiskey on top of the table. You understand, right? With wholehearted feeling, slowly, look at the camera, tenderly, and as if you are meeting old friends, say the words. As if you are Bogie in ''Casablanca,'' saying, ''Cheers to you guys,'' Suntory time!
:'''Interpreter''' [In English, to Bob]: He wants you to turn, look in camera. O.K.?
:'''Bob''': That's all he said?<ref>{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6DD103AF932A1575AC0A9659C8B63 |title=What Else Was Lost in Translation |accessdate=2007-11-04 |last=Rich |first=Motoko |date=[[2003-09-21]] |work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

== Locations ==
The bar featured throughout the film is the New York Bar, situated on the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt Tokyo hotel in [[Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo]].<ref>[http://tokyo.park.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/entertainment/lounges/index.jsp Tokyo Bars: New York Bar, Peak Bar, Hotel Park Hyatt Tokyo, Japan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Other locations include the [[Heian Jingu]] shrine in Kyoto and the steps of the giant San-mon gate at [[Nanzen-ji]].  All locations mentioned in the film are the names of actual places, bars or businesses that existed in Tokyo at the time of filming.

== Reaction ==
Boosted by critical acclaim and audience word-of-mouth, this modest feature film (with only a [[United States dollar|$]]4 million budget<ref>{{cite web|url= http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/fashion/article4059937.ece|title= Sofia Coppola: I'm more interested in looking than being looked at|accessdate= 2008-06-03|author= Lisa Armstrong|date= 2008-06-04|publisher= [[The Times]]}}</ref>) became a comparative box office hit, returning over $45M in receipts from the U.S. alone. ''Lost in Translation'' has been praised not only for [[Sofia Coppola|Coppola]]'s script and distinctive directing, but also for the work of [[Bill Murray|Murray]], who by many accounts gave the performance of his career.<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030912/REVIEWS/309120302/1023 Roger Ebert: "These are two wonderful performances. Bill Murray has never been better."]</ref> [[Scarlett Johansson|Johansson]] also received notice for her strong performance. Overall, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars, describing it as "sweet and sad at the same time as it is sardonic and funny."

Some reviewers criticized the film's purposely vague ending, in which Coppola skirted the concept of [[denouement]] and left the conclusion entirely up to the opinions of viewers. For example, Noel Megahey of [[DVD Times]] considered this device a "cheat" on the audience and argued that the film was "equally as endearing as frustrating for viewers".<ref>[http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=11265 DVDTimes review]</ref>  

One of the most negative reviews came from Kiku Day <U+2013> a reviewer for British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' <U+2013> who strongly criticized the movie for what she claimed was "anti-Japanese racism". The reviewer cited the film as an example of how Hollywood was, as she saw it, "the handmaiden to perpetuating the belief of the superiority of US cultural values over all others" and characterized director Coppola as "the thinking person's [[Sylvester Stallone]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1130137,00.html |title=Totally lost in translation |accessdate=2007-11-04 |last=Day |first=Kiku |date=[[2004-01-24]] |work=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref>
