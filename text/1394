== History ==
Before teams in Major League Soccer had played their first match and before the selection of the first cities MLS teams would represent, Seattle was considered a viable location that could support a professional soccer team at the highest level in the United States.<ref name="1994mls"/>  In 1994, as the United States was in the final preparations to host the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], Seattle was one of more than 30 cities that expressed interest in acquiring an MLS team.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Farrey |title=Big Soccer Surprise: 38,000 To See Match |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940128&slug=1891994 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=January 28, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref>  However, even in 1994, the absence of a "soccer-only stadium" was recognized as a key factor that would keep the MLS away from the strong soccer fan base in the Seattle area.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Farrey |title=Key Need For Soccer: A Stadium |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940204&slug=1893501 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 4, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref>  Another criterion needed for considering a city for getting an inaugural MLS team was to secure 10,000 deposits for season tickets.<ref name="1994tickets">{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Farrey |title=Soccer League Rejects Sounders' Plan; Two Will Compete To Sell Season Tickets |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940224&slug=1896933 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 24, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref>  By the June 3, 1994 deadline for MLS team bids, Seattle organizers had only exceeded 1,300 total deposits.<ref>{{cite news |title=Soccer Ticket Pledges Exceed 1,300 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940603&slug=1913752 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=June 4, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}</ref>  This was because at the same time that the season ticket campaign for the MLS team was taking place, a competing season ticket effort was happening for the [[Seattle Sounders (USL)|APSL Sounders]] expansion team.<ref name="1994tickets"/>  In a June 14, 1994 announcement, Seattle was not included among the first 7 cities to receive MLS teams, though 5 more cities would be announced later that year.<ref name="1994mls">{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Farrey |title=Seattle Misses First Mls Cut<U+2014>But Bid Isn't Dead |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940615&slug=1915706 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=June 15, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}</ref>  In an effort to improve their chances, Seattle MLS organizers began working with the [[University of Washington]] to use [[Husky Stadium]] as an interim stadium while they pursued the construction of a permanent soccer-specific facility.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Farrey |title=Seattle Gets Boost In Bid For Team<U+2014>Husky Stadium Might Be Mls Site |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19940717&slug=1920841 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=July 17, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}</ref>  In November 1994, as the start of first MLS season was postponed another year (from 1995 to 1996) it was noted that the absence of an adequate grass-field facility in the area and the presence of the new APSL Seattle Sounders team had hurt momentum for Seattle's MLS bid.<ref>{{cite news |title=Major League Soccer Postponed Until 1996 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19941116&slug=1942150 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=November 16, 1994 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}</ref>  Seattle was not among the cities to have a team play in the first MLS season.<ref>{{cite news |title=U.S. PRO SOCCER TO BECOME REALITY IN MARCH OF '96 |url=http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/463166/US-PRO-SOCCER-TO-BECOME-REALITY-IN-MARCH-OF-96.html |work=[[Deseret News]] |date=June 7, 1995 |accessdate=2009-06-23 }}</ref>

In 1996, as [[Seattle Seahawks]] owner [[Paul Allen]] worked with the city to build a new football stadium for his team, the potential of an MLS expansion team that could be a co-tenant helped drive public support for the effort.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elliott |last=Almond |title=Want A Stadium For Football?

Fans were able to choose a new name for the team in an online poll held between March 27 and March 31, 2008.

During the pregame ceremonies of the Sounders FC inaugural home game a Golden Scarf, emblazoned with the Sounders name, was awarded to MLS Commissioner [[Don Garber]].<ref>{{cite news |first= Jos<U+00E9> Miguel |last=Romero |title=Sounders FC fans' passion bowls over commissioner |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2008917847_sounders25.html |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2009 }}</ref> This began a tradition where before each home game the club honors a member of the community with the presentation of the Golden Scarf, symbolizing the game of soccer.  The honored recipient raises the scarf over their heads, signaling to the fans to do the same. Because of the arrangement of the ceremony, the club has the opportunity to honor a presenter as well.
