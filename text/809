==Architecture==
===Exterior===
St James' is constructed in [[sandstone]] [[rubble]] with [[ashlar]] dressings and has a tiled roof. Its plan consists of a four-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] nave with a [[clerestory]], north and south [[aisle]]s, a south porch, a three-bay chancel, a north vestry, and a west tower.  The tower is in three stages with [[buttress]]es at the corners, and in the centre of each side.  There is a lancet window in either one or both stages of each  central buttress.  Above the central buttress on the west side is a lozenge-shaped clock face.  On each side of the top stage is a [[louver|louvred]] bell opening.  The [[parapet]] is [[corbel]]led and [[battlement]]ed.  The south porch is [[gable]]d with buttresses, a pointed-arched doorway and two lancet windows on each side.<ref name=nhl/>

In the wall of the south aisle are a single lancet and two paired lancet windows; along the north aisle are three pairs of lancets.  The clerestory has four round-headed windows on each side.  There is a further lancet window in the west and east ends of both aisles.  Along the south wall of the chancel is a pointed-arched window, a priest's door with a pointed arch, three lancet windows, and three [[niche (architecture)|niches]] for images.  The east window is a triple lancet with a stepped [[hood mould|hoodmould]].  On the north side of the chancel are three lancets.  The vestry has a pointed-arched east window, and paired lancet on the north side.  There are cross [[finial]]s on the gable ends.<ref name=nhl/>

===Interior===
The [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]] are supported by [[pier (architecture)|piers]], some of which are circular, others octagonal.  On the north side of the chancel is a double [[aumbry]]; on the south side is a single aumbry and a damaged [[piscina]].  In the south aisle is a recess dating from the middle of the 14th&nbsp;century with a [[crocket]]ed [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]], a finial at the apex and [[pinnacle]]s at the sides; it had possibly been an [[Easter Sepulchre]].  The monuments include a 13th-century [[effigy]] of a knight with [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]], a sword and a shield; a grave cover carved with a foliated cross, a man's head, and hands in prayer; and two [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] cross shafts dating from about 800.<ref name=nhl/>  The single [[manual (music)|manual]] organ was built by [[Henry Bryceson|Bryceson and Company]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N12040| title = Yorkshire, North Riding (Yorkshire, North), Melsonby, St. James the Great (N12040)| accessdate = 22&nbsp;July 2011| publisher = [[British Institute of Organ Studies]]}}</ref>  The [[ring of bells|ring]] consists of four bells.
