'''Duke or Duchess of Acerenza''' is a noble title created by the Kings of Spain for Don Galeazzo Pinelli, Patrician of [[Genoa]], on 12 April [[1593]], with succession stipulated according to Spanish nobiliary law.

Don Galeazzo's father, Don Cosimo had held the office of Grand Chancellor ([http://www.sardimpex.com/varia/Cancellieri%20del%20Regno%20di%20Sicilia.htm/ 'Gran Cancelliere']) of the Kingdom of Naples from [[1557]]-[[1562]], and the feudality of Acerenza had been acquired by the Pinelli three decades before the grant in [[1563]].  Inherited by marriage with the Pinelli, the title of Duke or Duchess of Acerenza is currently held by the [[Prince or Princess Belmonte]].  It has been used historically by the Prince or Princess's heir as a courtesy title.

==Succession==
*'''Don Galeazzo Francesco Pinelli''', 1st Duke of Acerenza, Marquess of [[Tursi]], married Donna Livia Squarciafico (died [[1602]]), daughter of Don Uberto Squarciafico of Genoa (died [[1562]]).  Donna Livia's dowry included the fief of the Contea (Earldom) of Copertino, acquired in [[1557]].  Don Uberto had also acquired the feudalities of Galatone, Lequile, Veglie and Leverano in the same year.  Don Galeazzo himself obtained the Marquesate of Tursi in [[1568]] from Don [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]], 6th Prince of Melfi.

''Note:'' Don Galeazzo was the son and heir of Don Cosimo Pinelli, (d. [[1601]]), himself son of Donna Livia Squarciafico and Don Galeazzo Pinelli.  Don Cosimo was married twice: to Donna Nicoletta Grillo, daughter of Don Agapito Grillo, Guardian ('Custode') of the Galley of Admiral [[Andrea Doria]], and of Donna Luisa, daughter of Don Marco Centurione [[Marquess of Estepa]] and of Donna Battina Negrone, and previously to Donna Dianora d<U+2019>Avalos.  (Donna Clemenza and Donna Lucrezia were the daughters of Don Cosimo by Donna Dianora.  The former married Don Fabrizio [http://www.sardimpex.com/files/CANTELMO.HTM Cantelmo], 4th Duke of Popoli, of the ancient Provencal seigneurs of Tarascon, Boulbon and Romans, the latter married Don Antonio [http://www.sardimpex.com/Files%204/GUEVARA.htm Guevara], of the Counts of Potenza, Hereditary Grand Seneschals of the Kingdom of Sicily and Naples.)  
 
*'''Don Cosimo Pinelli''', 2nd Duke of Acerenza.  Married Donna Anna Maria Ravaschieri Fieschi, 3rd [[Princess of Belmonte]] ''suo iure''.  (Note: on 23 May [[1642]], Don Cosimo presented to the [[Archbishop of Acerenza and Matera]], [[Simone Carafa Roccella]] ([[1638]]-[[1647]]), a building for the foundation of a seminary in Acerenza to serve the diocese.)
 
*'''Don Galeazzo Francesco Pinelli''', 3rd Duke of Acerenza, married Donna Giustiniana Pignatelli, daughter of Don Fabrizio Pignatelli, 1st Prince of Noia and 3rd Marquess of Cerchiara.

''After the death of the 3rd Duke, the Princes and Princesses of Belmonte, and of the Holy Roman Empire (see [[Prince or Princess Belmonte]]) have held the subsidiary title of Duke or Duchess of Acerenza, as Grandees of Spain on the Acerenza Fief''.  The title of Duke or Duchess of Acerenza has historically been the courtesy title of the Prince or Princess's heir of line.
