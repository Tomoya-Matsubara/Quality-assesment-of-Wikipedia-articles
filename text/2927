'''Janis Lyn Joplin''' (January 19, 1943&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;October 4, 1970) was an [[United States|American]] singer, songwriter and music arranger, from [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. She rose to prominence in the late 1960s as the [[lead singer]] of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] and later as a solo artist. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked Joplin number 46 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Immortals: The First Fifty |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939214/the_immortals_the_first_fifty|accessdate=2008-05-12}}</ref> and number 28 on its 2008 list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/24161972/page/28|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> 

==Early life==
Janis Joplin was born to Seth (1910-1987) and Dorothy (1913-1998) (n<U+00E9>e East) Joplin in [[Port Arthur, Texas]];<ref name="scars">{{cite book|title=Scars of Sweet Paradise: The Life and Times of Janis Joplin|author=Echols, Alice|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company]]|date=2000-02-15|isbn=0805053948}}</ref> her father was an [[engineer]] at [[Texaco]], her mother, a [[registrar]] at a business college. She had two younger siblings, Michael and Laura. The family attended the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]].<ref> [http://www.cts.edu/News/FullStory.cfm?Ref=News&details=73 Don Haymes] in http://www.adherents.com/people/pj/Janis_Joplin.html.</ref> The Joplins felt that Janis always needed more attention than their other children, with her mother stating, "She was unhappy and unsatisfied without [receiving a lot of attention]. The normal rapport wasn't adequate."<ref name="jacobson">{{cite book|title=Hollywood Heartbreak: The Tragic and Mysterious Deaths of Hollywood's Most Remarkable Legends|author=Jacobson, Laurie|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|month=October | year=1984|isbn=067149998X}}</ref> 

As a [[teenager]], she befriended a group of outcasts, one of whom had albums by African-American [[blues]] artists [[Bessie Smith]] and [[Leadbelly]], whom Joplin later credited with influencing her decision to become a singer.<ref name="amburn">{{cite book|title=Pearl: The Obsessions and Passions of Janis Joplin : A Biography|author=Amburn, Ellis|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|month=October | year=1992|isbn=0446516406}}</ref> She began singing in the local [[choir]] and expanded her listening to blues singers such as [[Odetta]] and [[Big Mama Thornton]]. 

Primarily a painter while still in school, she first began singing [[blues]] and [[folk music]] with friends. While at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Port Arthur, Texas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]], she stated that she was mostly shunned.<ref name="amburn"/> Joplin was quoted as saying, "I was a misfit. I read, I painted, I didn't hate [[nigger]]s."<ref name="jacobson"/> As a teen, she became overweight and her skin broke out so badly she was left with deep scars which required [[dermabrasion]].<ref name="jacobson"/><ref name="caserta"/><ref name="buried"/> Other kids at high school would routinely taunt her and call her names like "pig," "freak" or "creep."<ref name="jacobson"/>

Joplin graduated from [[high school]] in 1960 and attended [[Lamar University|Lamar State College of Technology]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]] during the summer<ref name="caserta"/> and later the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], though she did not complete her studies.<ref name="style">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/joplin.htm|title=Janis Joplin: A Cry Cutting Through Time |publisher=Washington Post|date=1998-05-05|author=Hendrickson, Paul}}</ref> The campus newspaper ran a profile of her in 1962 headlined "She Dares To Be Different."<ref name="style"/>

==Career==
===Early efforts===
Cultivating a rebellious manner, Joplin styled herself in part after her female blues heroines and, in part, after the [[Beat poet]]s. Her very first song recorded on tape, at the home of a fellow student in December 1962, was "[[What Good Can Drinkin' Do (song)|What Good Can Drinkin' Do]]."<ref name="Paytress 1994">{{Citation  | last = Paytress  | first = Mark  | title = Janis Joplin. Mark Paytress assesses Columbia's three-CD 'Janis' retrospective  | journal = [[Record Collector]]  | volume = 175  | pages = 140<U+2013>141  | date = March 1994 }}</ref> She left Texas for [[San Francisco]] in 1963, living in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] and later [[Haight-Ashbury]]. In 1964, Joplin and future [[Jefferson Airplane]] guitarist [[Jorma Kaukonen]] recorded a number of blues standards, further accompanied by Margareta Kaukonen on [[typewriter]] (as percussion instrument). This session included seven tracks: "Typewriter Talk," "Trouble In Mind," "Kansas City Blues," "[[Hesitation Blues]]," "[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]," "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy" and "Long Black Train Blues," and was later released as the [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''[[The Typewriter Tape]].'' 

Around this time her drug use increased, and she acquired a reputation as a "speed freak" and occasional [[heroin]] user.<ref name="caserta">{{cite book|title=Going Down With Janis |author=Caserta, Peggy|publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|month=October | year=1980|isbn=0440131944}}</ref><ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/> She also used other [[psychoactive drug|intoxicants]] and was a [[alcoholism|heavy drinker]] throughout her career; her trademark beverage was [[Southern Comfort]].

In the spring of 1965, Joplin's friends, noticing the physical effects of her [[amphetamine]] habit (she was described as "skeletal"<ref name="amburn"/> and "emaciated"<ref name="scars"/>), persuaded her to return to Port Arthur, Texas. In May 1965, Joplin's friends threw her a bus-fare party so she could return home.<ref name="scars"/> Back in Port Arthur, she changed her lifestyle. She avoided drugs and alcohol, began wearing relatively modest dresses, adopted a [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairdo, and enrolled as a [[sociology]] major at [[Lamar University]] in nearby [[Beaumont, Texas]]. During her year at Lamar University, she commuted to Austin to perform solo, accompanying herself on guitar. One of her performances was reviewed in the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''. Joplin became engaged to a man who visited her, wearing a blue [[serge]] suit, to ask her father for her hand in marriage, but the man terminated plans for the marriage soon after.<ref name="buried"/>

===Big Brother and the Holding Company===
In 1966, Joplin's bluesy vocal style attracted the attention of the [[psychedelic rock]] band [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], a band that had gained some renown among the nascent [[hippie]] community in [[Haight-Ashbury]]. She was recruited to join the group by [[Chet Helms]], a promoter who had known her in Texas and who at the time was managing Big Brother. Joplin joined Big Brother on June 4, 1966.<ref name="year1966">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.officialjanis.com/dates_1966.html|title=Janis Joplin Discography|publisher=Janis Joplin}}</ref> Her first public performance with them was at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] in San Francisco. Due to persistent persuading by keyboardist and close friend Stephen Ryder, Joplin avoided drug use for several weeks, enjoining bandmate Dave Getz to promise that using needles would not be allowed in their rehearsal space or in the communal apartment where they lived.<ref name="buried"/> When a visitor to the apartment injected drugs in front of Joplin, she angrily reminded Getz that he had broken his promise.<ref name="buried"/>  A San Francisco concert from that summer was recorded and released in the 1984 album ''Cheaper Thrills''.<!--this is Cheaper Thrills, 1984 album, NOT Cheap Thrills, which was released in 1968. Please DO NOT change this.-->  

On August 23, 1966,<ref name="year1966" /> during a four week engagement in [[Chicago]], the group signed a deal with independent label [[Mainstream Records]].<ref name="dalton"/> They recorded tracks in a Chicago recording studio, but the label owner [[Bob Shad]] refused to pay their airfare back to San Francisco.<ref name="amburn"/> Shortly after the five band members drove from Chicago to Northern California with very little money, they moved with the [[Grateful Dead]] to a house in [[Lagunitas, California]]. It was there that Joplin relapsed into hard drugs. 

In early 1967, Joplin met [[Country Joe McDonald]] of the group [[Country Joe and the Fish]]. The pair lived together as a couple for a few months.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="dalton"/> Joplin and Big Brother began playing clubs in San Francisco, at the [[Fillmore West]], [[Winterland]] and the [[Avalon Ballroom]]. They also played at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in [[Los Angeles]], as well as in [[Seattle]], [[Washington]], [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]],  the Psychedelic Supermarket in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] and the Golden Bear Club in [[Huntington Beach, California]].<ref name="dalton"/>

The band's debut album was released by [[Columbia Records]] in August 1967, shortly after the group's breakthrough appearance in June at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. Two songs from Big Brother's set at Monterey were filmed. "Combination of the Two" and a version of [[Big Mama Thornton]]'s "[[Ball and Chain (Big Mama Thornton song)|Ball and Chain]]" appeared in [[D.A. Pennebaker]]'s documentary ''[[Monterey Pop]]''. The film captured [[Cass Elliot]] in the crowd silently mouthing "Wow! That's really heavy!" during Joplin's performance.<ref name="amburn"/>

In November 1967, the group parted ways with Chet Helms and signed with top artist manager [[Albert Grossman]]. Up to this point, Big Brother had performed mainly in California, but had gained national prominence with their Monterey performance. On February 16, 1968,<ref name="year1968">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.officialjanis.com/dates_1968.html|title=Janis Joplin Concert Dates - 1968|publisher=Janis Joplin}}</ref> the group began its first East Coast tour in Philadelphia, and the following day gave their first performance in New York City at the Anderson Theater.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/> On April 7, 1968, the last day of their East Coast tour, Joplin and Big Brother performed with [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Buddy Guy]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Paul Butterfield]], and [[Elvin Bishop]] at the "[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Wake for Martin Luther King, Jr.]]" concert in New York.

During the spring of 1968, Joplin and Big Brother made their nationwide television debut on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] daytime variety show hosted by [[Dick Cavett]]. Later, she made three appearances on the primetime Cavett program. During this time, the band was billed as "Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company,"<ref name="dalton"/> although the media coverage given to Joplin incurred resentment among the other members of the band.<ref name="dalton"/> The other members of Big Brother thought that Joplin was on a "star trip," while others were telling Joplin that Big Brother was a terrible band and that she ought to dump them.<ref name="dalton"/>

''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine called Joplin "probably the most powerful singer to emerge from the white rock movement," and Richard Goldstein, in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine, wrote that Joplin was "the most staggering leading woman in rock... she slinks like tar, scowls like war... clutching the knees of a final stanza, begging it not to leave... Janis Joplin can sing the chic off any listener."<ref name="jacobson"/>

Big Brother's second album, ''[[Cheap Thrills]]'', featured a cover design by counterculture cartoonist [[Robert Crumb]]. Although ''[[Cheap Thrills]]'' sounded as if it was mostly "live," only one track ("Ball and Chain") was actually recorded live; the rest of the tracks were studio recordings.<ref name="scars"/> The album had a raw quality, including the sound of a cocktail glass breaking and the broken shards being swept away during the song "Turtle Blues." With the documentary film ''Monterey Pop'' released in late 1968, the album launched Joplin's successful, albeit short, musical career.<ref name="craig">{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Albums: The Inside Story Behind Pop Music's Blockbuster Records|author=Rosen, Craig|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|month=May | year=1996|isbn=0823075869}}</ref> 

''[[Cheap Thrills]]'', which gave the band a breakthrough hit single, "[[Piece of My Heart]]," reached the number one spot on the Billboard charts eight weeks after its release, remaining for eight (nonconsecutive) weeks.<ref name="craig"/> The album was certified gold at release and sold over a million copies in the first month of its release.<ref name="buried">{{cite book|title=Buried Alive: The Biography of Janis Joplin|author=Friedman, Myra|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]]|date=1992-09-15|isbn=0517586509}}</ref><ref name="dalton"/> ''[[Live at Winterland '68]]'', recorded at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] on April 12 and 13, 1968, featured Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company at the height of their mutual career working through a selection of tracks from their albums.

The band made another East Coast tour during July-August 1968, performing at the [[Columbia Records]] convention in [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Newport Folk Festival]]. After returning to San Francisco for two hometown shows at the [[Palace of Fine Arts]] Festival on August 31 and September 1, Joplin announced that she would be leaving Big Brother. The group continued touring through the fall and Joplin gave her last official performance with Big Brother at a [[Chet Helms|Family Dog]] benefit on December 1, 1968.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/>

===Solo career===
After splitting from Big Brother, Joplin formed a new backup group, the Kozmic Blues Band. The band was influenced by the [[Stax Records|Stax-Volt]] Rhythm and Blues bands of the 1960s, as exemplified by [[Otis Redding]] and [[the Bar-Kays]], who were major musical influences on Joplin.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/><ref name="buried"/> The Stax-Volt R&B sound was typified by the use of horns and had a more bluesy, funky, soul, pop-oriented sound than most of the hard-rock psychedelic bands of the period. 

By early 1969, Joplin was addicted to [[heroin]], allegedly shooting at least $200 worth of heroin per day,<ref name="caserta"/> although efforts were made to keep her clean during the recording of ''[[I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!]]''. Gabriel Mekler, who produced the ''Kozmic Blues'', told publicist-turned-biographer Myra Friedman after Joplin's death that the singer had lived in his house during the June 1969 recording sessions at his insistence so he could keep her away from drugs and her drug-using friends.<ref name="buried"/> 

The Kozmic Blues album, released in September 1969, was certified gold later that year but did not match the success of ''[[Cheap Thrills]]''.<ref name="craig"/> Reviews of the new group were mixed. Some music critics, including [[Ralph Gleason]] of the [[San Francisco Chronicle]], were negative. Gleason wrote that the new band was a "drag" and that Joplin should "scrap" her new band and "go right back to being a member of Big Brother...(if they'll have her)."<ref name="scars"/> Other reviewers, such as reporter [[Carl Bernstein]] of the [[Washington Post]] generally ignored the flaws and devoted entire articles to celebrating the singer's magic.

Joplin and the Kozmic Blues Band toured North America and Europe throughout 1969, appearing at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] in August. By most accounts, Woodstock was not a happy affair for Joplin.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/><ref name="caserta"/> Faced with a ten hour wait after arriving at the festival, she shot heroin<ref name="amburn"/><ref name="caserta"/> and was drinking alcohol, so by the time she hit the stage, she was "three sheets to the wind."<ref name="scars"/> Joplin also had problems at [[Madison Square Garden]] where, as she told rock journalist David Dalton, the audience watched and listened to "every note [she sang] with 'Is she gonna make it?' in their eyes."<ref name="dalton"/> Joplin's performance was not included in the documentary film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' although the 25th anniversary director's cut of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' includes her performance of ''Work Me, Lord''.

At the end of the year, the group broke up. Their final gig with Joplin was at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City on the night of December 19&ndash;20, 1969.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="dalton">{{cite book|title=Piece Of My Heart|author=Dalton, David|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|date=1991-08-21|isbn=0306804468}}</ref>

===Full Tilt Boogie Band===
In February 1970, Joplin traveled to [[Brazil]], where she stopped her drug and alcohol use. She was accompanied on vacation there by her friend Linda Gravenites, who had designed the singer's stage costumes from 1966 to 1969. Joplin was romanced by an American schoolteacher named David (George) Niehaus, who was traveling around the world. They were photographed by the press at Carnival in Rio de Janeiro.<ref name="dalton"/> Gravenites also took photographs of the two during their Brazilian vacation and they appeared to be a "carefree, happy, healthy young couple" having a great time.<ref name="amburn"/> 

Joplin began using heroin again when she returned to the United States. Her relationship with Niehaus soon ended because of the drugs, her relationship with Peggy Caserta and refusal to take some time off work and travel the world with him.<ref name="amburn"/> Around this time she formed her new band, the [[Full Tilt Boogie Band]].<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/><ref name="buried"/> The band was composed mostly of young Canadian musicians and featured an organ, but no horn section. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie Band than she did with her prior group. She was quoted as saying, "It's ''my'' band. Finally it's ''my'' band!"<ref name="scars"/> 

The Full Tilt Boogie Band began touring in May 1970. Joplin remained quite happy with her new group, which received mostly positive feedback from both her fans and the critics.<ref name="scars"/> Prior to beginning a summer tour with Full Tilt Boogie, she performed in a reunion with Big Brother at the [[Fillmore West]] in San Francisco on April 4, 1970.<ref name="year1970">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.officialjanis.com/dates_1970.html|title=Janis Joplin Concert Dates - 1970|publisher=Janis Joplin}}</ref> Recordings from this concert were included in an in-concert album released posthumously in 1972. She again appeared with Big Brother on April 12 at [[Winterland]] where she and Big Brother were reported to be in excellent form.<ref name="amburn"/>  By the time she began touring with Full Tilt Boogie, Joplin told people she was drug-free, but her drinking increased.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

From June 28 to July 4, 1970, Joplin and Full Tilt joined the all-star ''[[Festival Express]]'' tour through Canada, performing alongside the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Delaney and Bonnie]], [[Rick Danko]] and [[The Band]], [[Eric Andersen]] and [[Ian and Sylvia]].<ref name="amburn"/> They played concerts in [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] and [[Calgary]].<ref name="amburn"/><ref name="dalton"/> Footage of her performance of the song "Tell Mama" in [[Calgary]] became an [[MTV]] video in the 1980s and was included on the 1982 ''Farewell Song'' album. The audio of other Festival Express performances were included on that 1972 Joplin ''In Concert'' album. Video of the performances was included on the ''[[Festival Express]]'' DVD.

In the "Tell Mama" video shown on MTV in the 1980s, Joplin wore a psychedelically colored loose-fitting costume and feathers in her hair. This was her standard stage costume in the spring and summer of 1970. She chose the new costumes after her friend and designer, Linda Gravenites (whom Joplin had praised in the May 1968 issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''), cut ties with Joplin shortly after their return from Brazil, due largely to Joplin's continued use of heroin.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/>

During the ''[[Festival Express]]'' tour, Joplin was accompanied by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' writer David Dalton, who would later write several articles and a book on Joplin. She told Dalton:

{{cquote|I'm a victim of my own insides. There was a time when I wanted to know everything...It used to make me very unhappy, all that feeling. I just didn't know what to do with it. But now I've learned to make that feeling work ''for'' me. I'm full of emotion and I want a release, and if you're on stage and if it's really working and you've got the audience with you, it's a ''oneness'' you feel.<ref name="dalton"/>}}

===''Pearl''===
Among her last public appearances were two broadcasts of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]''. In the June 25, 1970 appearance, she announced that she would attend her ten-year [[Class reunion|high school class reunion]]. When asked if she had been popular in school, she admitted that when in high school, her schoolmates "laughed me out of class, out of town and out of the state."<ref name="cavett-janisinterview">{{cite episode|title=Dick Cavett TV. Interview (1970)|series=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|airdate=1970-08-03}}</ref> In the August 3, 1970 Cavett broadcast, Joplin referred to her upcoming performance at the [[Festival for Peace]] to be held at [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens, New York]] on August 6, 1970.

Joplin attended the reunion on August 14, accompanied by fellow musician and friend Bob Neuwirth, road manager John Cooke, and her sister Laura, but it reportedly proved to be a rather unhappy experience for her.<ref name="cavett">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-08-23|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-miller/happy-birthday-janis-jop_b_39055.html|title=Happy Birthday, Janis Joplin|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=2007-01-19|author=Miller, Danny}}</ref> Joplin held a press conference in Port Arthur during her reunion visit. Interviewed by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' journalist Chet Flippo, she was reported to wear enough jewelry for a "Babylonian whore."<ref name="amburn"/> When asked by a reporter during the reunion if Joplin entertained at [[Thomas Jefferson High School]] when she was a student there, Joplin replied, "Only when I walked down the aisles."<ref name="scars"/><ref name="jacobson"/><ref name="scars"/>  Joplin denigrated Port Arthur and the people who'd humiliated her a decade earlier in high school.<ref name="scars"/>

Joplin's last public performance, with the Full Tilt Boogie Band, took place on August 12, 1970 at the [[Harvard Stadium]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. A positive review appeared on the front page of the [[Harvard Crimson]] newspaper despite the fact that Full Tilt Boogie performed with makeshift sound amplifiers after their regular equipment was stolen in Boston.<ref name="buried"/>

[[Image:S489289.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The single cover of "Me & Bobby McGee"]]
During September 1970, Joplin and her band began recording a new album in Los Angeles with producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]], who had produced recordings for [[The Doors]]. Although Joplin died before all the tracks were fully completed, there was still enough usable material to compile an LP. "[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]" was included despite it being a first take, and the track "Buried Alive In The Blues", to which Joplin had been scheduled to add her vocals on the day she was found dead, was kept as an instrumental.

The result was the posthumously released ''[[Pearl (album)|Pearl]]'' (1971). It became the biggest selling album of her career<ref name="craig"/> and featured her biggest hit single, a cover of [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s "[[Me and Bobby McGee]]". Kristofferson had been Joplin's lover not long before her death.<ref>Anthony DeCurtis, ''Rolling Stone'', 30 September 1999</ref> Also included was the social commentary of the ''[[a cappella]]'' "[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]", written by Joplin, close friend and song writer [[Bob Neuwirth]] and [[Beat generation|beat poet]] [[Michael McClure]]. In 2003, ''Pearl'' was ranked #122 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

During the recording sessions for ''Pearl'', Joplin began seeing [[Seth Morgan]], a 21 year-old Berkeley student, cocaine dealer and future novelist;<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/><ref name="caserta"/> and checked into the Landmark Motel in Los Angeles to begin recording the ''[[Pearl (album)|Pearl]]'' album.<ref name="scars"/><ref name="amburn"/><ref name="buried"/> She and Morgan became engaged to be married in early September<ref name="jacobson"/> and Joplin threw herself into the recording of songs for her new album.

==Death==
The last recordings Joplin completed were "[[Mercedes Benz (song)|Mercedes Benz]]" and a birthday greeting for [[John Lennon]] ("[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]", composed by [[Dale Evans]]) on October 1, [[1970]]. Lennon, whose birthday was October 9, later told [[Dick Cavett]] that her taped greeting arrived at his home after her death.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} On Saturday, October 3, Joplin visited the Sunset Sound Studios<ref name="amburn"/> in Los Angeles to listen to the instrumental track for [[Nick Gravenites]]' song "Buried Alive in the Blues" prior to recording the vocal track, scheduled for the next day.<ref name="dalton"/> When she failed to show up at the studio by Sunday afternoon, producer Paul Rothchild became concerned. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager, John Cooke, drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel (since renamed the Highland Gardens Hotel) where Joplin had been a guest since August 24.<ref>''Los Angeles Herald Examiner'' October 5, 1970, front page. </ref> He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted [[Porsche]] still in the parking lot. Upon entering her room, he found her dead on the floor. The official cause of death was an overdose of [[heroin]], possibly combined with the effects of alcohol.

Joplin was [[cremation|cremated]] in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery|Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Mortuary]] in Los Angeles, and her ashes scattered from a plane into the [[Pacific Ocean]] and along [[Stinson Beach]]. The only funeral service was held at Pierce Brothers and attended by Joplin's parents and maternal aunt.<ref>{{cite book|title=Love, Janis |author=Joplin, Laura|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|date=2005-08-16|isbn=0060755229}}</ref>

==Legacy==

Joplin was a pioneer in the male-dominated rock music scene of the late 1960s, influencing generations of musicians to come. [[Stevie Nicks]] commented that after seeing Joplin perform, "I knew that a little bit of my destiny had changed. I would search to find that connection that I had seen between Janis and her audience. In a blink of an eye she changed my life."<ref>http://www.janisjoplin.net/reflections/ "Reflections."] ''JanisJoplin.net''. Accessed November 13, 2008.</ref> 

Joplin's body decoration, with a wristlet and a small heart on her left breast, by the San Francisco tattoo artist [[Lyle Tuttle]], is taken as a seminal moment in the tattoo revolution and was an early moment in the popular culture's acceptance of tattoos as art.<ref>{{cite news|author=Acord, Deb|title=Who knew: Mommy has a tattoo|publisher=[[Portland Press Herald]]|date=2006-11-10}}</ref> Another trademark was her flamboyant hair styles, often including colored streaks and accessories such as scarves, beads and feathers.

The 1979 film ''[[The Rose (film)|The Rose]]'' was loosely based on Joplin's life.<ref>{{cite book|title=Leonard Maltin's 2003 Movie And Video Guide |author=Maltin, Leonard|publisher=[[Plume (publishing)|Plume]]|date=2002-09-24|isbn=0452283299}}</ref> [[Bette Midler]] earned a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.

In the late 1990s, the [[Musical theatre|musical play]] ''[[Love, Janis (musical)|Love, Janis]]'' was created with input from Janis' younger sister Laura plus Big Brother guitarist [[Sam Andrew]], with an aim to take it to [[Off Broadway]]. Opening in the summer of 2001 and scheduled for only a few weeks of performances, the show won acclaim and packed houses and was held over several times, the demanding role of the singing Janis attracting rock vocalists from relative unknowns to pop stars [[Laura Branigan]] and [[Beth Hart]]. A national tour followed.
''Gospel According to Janis'', a biographical film starring [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Joplin, was originally scheduled to begin shooting in early 2007, now has a projected release date in 2010.<ref>{{imdb title|id=0384141|title=Gospel According to Janis}}</ref>

In 1988, the Janis Joplin Memorial, with an original [[bronze]], multi-image sculpture of Joplin by [[Douglas Clark (sculptor)|Douglas Clark]], was dedicated in Port Arthur, Texas.

Among the artifacts at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum Exhibition are Joplin's scarf and necklaces, her 1965 [[Porsche 356]] [[Convertible|Cabriolet]] with [[psychedelic]]ally-designed [[Art car|painting]], and a sheet of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide#Forms of LSD|LSD]] [[blotting paper]] designed by [[Robert Crumb]], designer of the ''Cheap Thrills'' cover.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.rockhall.com/exhibitfeatured/janis-joplin/|title=Janis Joplin|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]}}</ref>
