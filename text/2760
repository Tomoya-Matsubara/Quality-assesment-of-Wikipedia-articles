The '''1977 Vrancea Earthquake''' occurred on Friday, 4 March 1977, 21:20 local time and was felt throughout the [[Balkans]]. It had a [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] of 7.2 with an [[epicenter]] in [[Vrancea County|Vrancea]] (in the [[Eastern Carpathians]]) at a depth of {{convert|94|km|sp=us}}.

The earthquake killed about 1,578 people (1,424 in [[Bucharest]]) in Romania, and wounded more than 11,300.<ref>http://www.referat.ro/referate/Cutremurul_din_1977_38471.html</ref> Among the victims was the [[Romania]]n actor [[Toma Caragiu]]. [[Nicolae Ceau<U+0219>escu]] suspended his official trip to [[Nigeria]].

About 35,000 buildings were damaged, and the total damage was estimated at more than two billion [[United States dollar|dollars]]. Most of the damage was concentrated in Romania's [[Capital (political)|capital]], [[Bucharest]], where about 33 large buildings collapsed.  Most of those buildings were built before World War II, and were not reinforced. After the earthquake, the Romanian government imposed tougher construction standards.

In [[Bulgaria]], the [[earthquake]] is known as the '''Vrancea Earthquake''' or '''[[Svishtov]] Earthquake'''. Three blocks of flats in the Bulgarian town of [[Svishtov]] (near Zimnicea) collapsed, killing more than 100 people. Many other buildings were damaged, including the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Svishtov|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. In the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Republic of Moldova]] the earthquake destroyed and damaged many buildings. In the capital [[Chi<U+015F>in<U+0103>u|Kishinev]], a panic broke out.

== Damage and casualties ==
The earthquake of 4 March 1977 was one of the worst earthquake disasters of the [[1970s]] around the world. It caused the loss of 1,578 lives and injured an additional 11,221,<ref name="IITK">{{cite web |url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/14_10-0013.PDF |title=The Romanian earthquake of March 4, 1977 revisited: new insights into its territorial, economic and social impacts and their bearing on the preparedness for the future |work=Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur |author=Emil-Sever Georgescu, Antonios Pomonis |date=October 2008}}</ref> with 90% of the fatalities being in the capital city [[Bucharest]].

A number of 32 buildings of 8<U+2013>12 storey collapsed in the central part of city, while about 150 old buildings of 4<U+2013>6 storey high were strongly damaged.

No critical fires occurred, but electrical power was lost in large areas of the city for about a day. Nine of 35 hospitals were evacuated.
=== Other Romanian cities ===
In the cities of [[Foc<U+0219>ani]] and [[Buz<U+0103>u]], unreinforced masonry walls in low-rise construction collapsed partially or totally, and there were signs of movement between structural elements and adjacent masonry in-fill walls in recently constructed engineered buildings.

The city of [[Zimnicea]] was reported in ruins: 175 houses collapsed, while 523 sustained serious damage, 4,000 people were displaced, and there were hundreds of victims.<ref name="Historia" /> Inasmuch as 80% of the city was destroyed, Zimnicea was rebuilt from the ground.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Special/Raport+de+tara/Teleorman/RAPORT+DE+TARA+Orasul+Zimnicea+reconstruit+din+temelii+dupa+cutr |title=RAPORT DE <U+021A>AR<U+0102>.

In [[Ploie<U+0219>ti]] were destroyed around 200 homes, a further 2,000 were seriously damaged; the situation was also serious in [[Buz<U+0103>u County]], where about 1,900 buildings were affected.<ref name="Historia" /> In [[Plopeni]], a Worker's Dormitory made of masonry totally collapsed, killing 30 to 60 workers and injuring many.<ref name="GEM-ECD" /> Counties in [[Transylvania]] and [[Dobrogea]] showed no serious damage. 

The earthquake induced geomorphological phenomena in southern, eastern and northern [[Wallachia]], as well as southern [[Moldavia]]. These consisted in [[landslide]]s, [[liquefaction]], settlements, water spurting; in [[Vrancea Mountains]], the course of [[Z<U+0103>bala River (R<U+00E2>ul Negru)|Z<U+0103>bala River]] was partially blocked, forming a small natural dam lake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cutremur.net/2014/03/cutremurul-din-4-martie-1977.html |title=Cutremurul din 4 martie 1977 |work=Cutremur.net |date=3 March 2014 |language=Romanian}}</ref>
=== Bulgaria ===
The earthquake of 4 March was heavily impacted in Bulgaria. The city of [[Svishtov]] was the most affected. Here, three blocks of flats collapsed, killing up to 120 people, among them 27 children.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100143807/svishtov-commemorates-memory-of-1977-earthquake-victims |title=Svishtov commemorates memory of 1977 earthquake victims |work=Radio Bulgaria |date=4 March 2012}}</ref> Many other buildings were damaged, including the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Svishtov|Church of the Holy Trinity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/cutremurul-din-4-martie-1977-37-de-ani-de-la-seismul-care-a-facut-peste-1-500-de-morti-inregistrare-audio-realizata-in-timpul-cutremurului-galerie-foto-video-12190514 |title=Cutremurul din 4 martie 1977 - 37 de ani de la seismul care a f<U+0103>cut peste 1.500 de mor<U+021B>i. <U+00CE>nregistrare audio realizat<U+0103> <U+00EE>n timpul cutremurului |work=G<U+00E2>ndul |date=4 March 2013 |language=Romanian}}</ref>

== Aftershocks ==
The earthquake [[epicenter]] was located in the south-west part of [[Vrancea County]], the most active seismic area in [[Romania]], at a [[Elevation|depth]] of about {{convert|94|km|abbr=on}}. The [[shock wave]] was felt in almost all countries in the [[Balkan Peninsula]], as well as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] republics of [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavia]], albeit with a lower intensity. Seismic movement was followed by [[aftershock]]s of low [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]]. The strongest aftershock occurred on the morning of 5 March 1977, at 02:00 AM, at a depth of {{convert|109|km|abbr=on}}, with a magnitude was 4.9 on the [[Richter scale]]. Other aftershocks' magnitudes did not exceed 4.3 or 4.5 M<sub>w</sub>.<ref>http://www.ziare.com/articole/cutremurul+din+1977</ref>

== Reactions of authorities ==
At the time of the earthquake, Nicolae and Elena Ceau<U+0219>escu were in an official visit to [[Nigeria]]. Ceau<U+0219>escu heard about the disaster in the country from a Romanian official.

Initially, news about the earthquake were confusing, and people talked about a much larger catastrophe. Due to a power failure in [[Bucharest]], communication services weren't run for several hours. The population took to the streets, scared of possible aftershocks. At that moment, authorities had not taken any concrete steps.<ref>[http://www.muzeuldefotografie.ro/2009/08/5-martie-1977-la-o-zi-dupa-cutremur/ "5 martie 1977, la o zi dup<U+0103> cutremur"], ''Museum of Photography''</ref>

There were rescue teams from all blocks destroyed. Doctors, soldiers, men of different professions were presented at work. Nine hospitals were decommissioned. Floreasca Emergency Hospital in Bucharest, although seriously damaged, was taken by storm. Subsequently, it was evacuated. The Dinamo Stadium was turned into a triage point for the wounded. By the morning of March 5 work was underway on rehabilitating basic utilities <U+2013> water, gas, telephony, electricity.<ref>[http://www.razbointrucuvant.ro/recomandari/2013/03/04/cutremurul-1977-video/ "CUTREMURUL DIN 4 MARTIE 1977 (video <U+00AB><U+00CE>n premier<U+0103><U+00BB>, TVR, plus alte m<U+0103>rturii)"], ''R<U+0103>zboi <U+00EE>ntru Cuv<U+00E2>nt''</ref>

After reconnecting with the country, [[Nicolae Ceau<U+0219>escu]] imposed the state of emergency throughout the country. The presidential couple and Romanian delegation in [[Nigeria]] returned to Romania during the night of 4 to 5 March 1977. In the following days, the Head of State conducted visits to Bucharest to assess damage.<ref>[http://jurnalul.ro/stiri/observator/4-martie-1977-ziua-in-care-romania-a-fost-zguduita-video-606017.html "4 martie 1977, ziua <U+00EE>n care Rom<U+00E2>nia a fost zguduit<U+0103>"], ''Jurnalul.ro''</ref>

Teams of military and firefighters responsible for the rescue of possible survivors received aid from the [[Red Cross]]. They were joined by the [[Buftea]] film studio stuntsmen and many volunteers. Many people were rescued from the ruins, some after several days of being trapped.
