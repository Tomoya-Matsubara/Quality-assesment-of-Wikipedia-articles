'''Lug''' or '''Lugh''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|<U+02C8>|l|u<U+02D0>}}; [[Irish language|modern Irish]]: '''L<U+00FA>''') is an Irish [[deity]] represented in [[Irish mythology|mythological]] texts as a hero and [[High King of Ireland|High King]] of the distant past. He is known by the epithets ''L<U+00E1>mhfhada'' (pronounced /'la:wad<U+032A><U+02E0><U+0259>/, meaning "long arm" or "long hand"), for his skill with a [[spear]] or [[sling (weapon)|sling]], ''Ild<U+00E1>nach'' ("skilled in many arts"), ''Samhild<U+00E1>nach'' ("Equally skilled in many arts"), ''Lonnbeimnech'' ("fierce striker" or perhaps "sword-shouter") and ''Macnia'' ("boy hero"), and by the [[matronymic]] ''mac Ethlenn'' or ''mac Ethnenn'' ("son of Ethliu or [[Ethniu]]"). He is a [[Reflex (linguistics)|reflex]] of the pan-[[Celt]]ic god [[Lugus]], and his [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] counterpart is [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]], "The Bright One with the Strong Hand".

==Lugh in Irish tradition==

===Birth===
Lugh's father is [[Cian]] of the [[Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann]], and his mother is [[Ethniu]], daughter of [[Balor]], of the [[Fomorians]]. In ''Cath Maige Tuired'' their union is a dynastic marriage following an alliance between the Tuatha D<U+00E9> and the Fomorians.<ref>[[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] (ed. & trans), [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T300011.html "The Second Battle of Moytura"], [[Revue Celtique]] 12, 1891, p. 59</ref> In the ''[[Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn]]'' Cian gives the boy to [[Tailtiu]], queen of the [[Fir Bolg]], in [[fosterage]].<ref>''[[Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn]]'' [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/lebor4.html#55 <U+00A7>59]</ref>

A [[folktale]] told to [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] by Shane O'Dugan of [[Tory Island]] in 1835 recounts the birth of a grandson of Balor who grows up to kill his grandfather. The grandson is unnamed, his father is called Mac Cinnfhaelaidh and the manner of his killing of Balor is different, but it has been taken as a version of the birth of Lugh, and was adapted as such by [[Lady Gregory]]. In this tale, Balor hears a druid's prophecy that he will be killed by his own grandson. To prevent this he imprisons his only daughter in the T<U+00F3>r M<U+00F3>r (great tower) of [[Tory Island]], cared for by twelve women, who are to prevent her ever meeting or even learning of the existence of men. On the mainland, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh owns a magic cow who gives such abundant milk that everyone, including Balor, wants to possess her. While the cow is in the care of Mac Cinnfhaelaidh's brother Mac Samthainn, Balor appears in the form of a little red-haired boy and tricks him into giving him the cow. Looking for revenge, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh calls on a ''[[leanan s<U+00ED>dhe]]'' (fairy woman) called [[Bir<U+00F3>g]], who transports him by magic to the top of Balor's tower, where he seduces Eithne. In time she gives birth to triplets, which Balor gathers up in a sheet and sends to be drowned in a whirlpool. The messenger drowns two of the babies, but unwittingly drops one child into the harbour, where he is rescued by Bir<U+00F3>g. She takes him to his father, who gives him to his brother, [[Goibniu|Gavida]] the smith, in fosterage.<ref>[[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] (ed. & trans.), ''Annala Rioghachta <U+00C9>ireann: Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters'' Vol. 1, 1856, pp. 18-21, footnote ''S''; T. W. Rolleston, ''Myths and Legends of the Celtic Race'', 1911, pp. 109-112; [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]], ''Gods and Fighting Men'', 1094, pp. 27-29</ref>

There may be further triplism associated with his birth. His father in the folktale is one of a triad of brothers, Mac Cinnfhaelaidh, Gavida and Mac Samthainn, and his father in the medieval texts, Cian, is often mentioned together with his brothers C<U+00FA> and Cethen.<ref>e.g. ''Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/lebor4.html#55 <U+00A7>61]; [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/turenn.html "The Fate of the Children of Tuirenn"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co., 1936, pp. 49-81</ref> Two characters called [[Lugaid (disambiguation)|Lugaid]], a popular [[medieval]] Irish name thought to derive from Lugh, have three fathers: [[Lugaid Riab nDerg]] (Lugaid of the Red Stripes)  was the son of the three ''[[Findemna]]'' or fair triplets,<ref>Vernam Hull (ed. & Trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/medb.html "''Aided Meidbe'': The Violent Death of Medb"], ''Speculum'' v.13 issue 1. (Jan. 1938), pp. 52-61</ref>  and [[Lugaid mac Con Ro<U+00ED>]] was also known as ''mac Tr<U+00ED> Con'', "son of three hounds".<ref>James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 273</ref> In Ireland's other great "sequestered maiden" story, the tragedy of [[Deirdre]], the king's intended is carried off by three brothers, who are hunters with hounds.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/usnech.html "Deirdre, or the Exile of the sons of Usnech"] (ed. & trans. unknown)</ref> The canine imagery continues with Cian's brother C<U+00FA> ("hound"), another Lugaid, [[Lugaid Mac Con]] (son of a hound), and Lugh's son [[C<U+00FA>chulainn]] ("Culann's Hound").<ref>MacKillop 1998, pp. 102-104, 272-273</ref> A fourth Lugaid was [[Lugaid Lo<U+00ED>gde]], a legendary [[King of Tara]] and ancestor of (or inspiration for) Lugaid Mac Con.

===Lugh joins the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann===
As a young man Lugh travels to [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]] to join the court of king [[Nuada]] of the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann. The doorkeeper will not let him in unless he has a skill with which to serve the king. He offers his services as a wright, a smith, a champion, a swordsman, a harpist, a hero, a poet and historian, a sorcerer, and a craftsman, but each time is rejected as the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann already have someone with that skill. But when Lugh asks if they have anyone with all those skills simultaneously, the doorkeeper has to admit defeat, and Lugh joins the court and is appointed [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]]. He wins a flagstone-throwing contest against [[Ogma]], the champion, and entertains the court with his [[harp]]. The Tuatha D<U+00E9> are at that time oppressed by the Fomorians, and Lugh is amazed how meekly they accept this. Nuada wonders if this young man could lead them to freedom. Lugh is given command over the Tuatha D<U+00E9>, and he begins making preparations for war.<ref>Stokes 1891, pp. 75-81</ref>

===The sons of Tuireann===
When the sons of [[Tuireann]], Brian, [[Iuchar]] and [[Iucharba]], kill his father, Cian (who was in the form of a pig at the time), Lugh sets them a series of seemingly impossible quests as recompense. They achieve them all, but are fatally wounded in completing the last one. Despite Tuireann's pleas, Lugh denies them the use of one of the items they have retrieved, a magic pigskin which heals all wounds. They die of their wounds, and Tuireann dies of grief over their bodies.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/turenn.html "The Fate of the Children of Tuirenn"], Tom Peete Cross & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co., 1936, pp. 49-81</ref>

===The Battle of Magh Tuireadh===
Using the magic artifacts the sons of Tuireann have gathered, Lugh leads the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann in the [[Cath Maige Tuireadh|Second Battle of Mag Tuireadh]] against the [[Fomorians]]. Nuada is killed in the battle by Balor. Lugh faces Balor, who opens his terrible, poisonous eye that kills all it looks upon, but Lugh shoots a [[sling (weapon)|sling]]-stone that drives his eye out the back of his head, wreaking havoc on the Fomorian army behind. After the victory Lugh finds [[Bres]], the half-Fomorian former king of the Tuatha D<U+00E9>, alone and unprotected on the battlefield, and Bres begs for his life. If he is spared, he promises, he will ensure that the cows of Ireland always give milk. The Tuatha D<U+00E9> refuse the offer. He then promises four harvests a year, but the Tuatha D<U+00E9> say one harvest a year suits them. But Lugh spares his life on the condition that he teach the Tuatha D<U+00E9> how and when to plough, sow and reap.<ref>Stokes 1891, pp. 81-111</ref>

===Later life and death===
Lugh instituted a harvest fair during the festival of [[Lughnasadh]] in memory of his foster-mother, Tailtiu, held on 1 August at the town that bears her name (now [[Teltown]], [[County Meath]]). He likewise instituted Lughnasadh fairs in the areas of Carman and [[Naas]] in honour of [[Carman]] and N<U+00E1>s, the eponymous tutelary goddess of these two regions. Horse races and displays of martial arts were important activities at all three fairs. However, Lughnasadh itself is a celebration of Lugh's triumph over the spirits of the [[Other World]] who had tried to keep the harvest for themselves. It survived long into [[Christian]] times and is still celebrated under a variety of names. ''L<U+00FA>nasa'' is now the [[Irish language|Irish]] name for the month of August.

According to a poem of the ''[[dindsenchas]]'', Lugh was responsible for the death of Bres. He made 300 wooden cows, and filled them with a bitter, poisonous red liquid which was then "milked" into pails and offered to Bres to drink. Bres, who was under an obligation not to refuse hospitality, drank it down without flinching, and it killed him.<ref>E. J. Gwynn (ed. & trans.), ''The Metrical Dindshenchas'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T106500C/index.html Vol 3], 1906, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T106500C/text040.html Poem 40: Carn Hui Neit]</ref>

Lugh is said to have invented the board game [[fidchell]]. He had a dog called Failinis.

He had several wives, including Bu<U+00ED> and N<U+00E1>s, daughters of Ruadri, king of Britain. Bu<U+00ED> lived and was buried at [[Knowth]]. N<U+00E1>s was buried at [[Naas]], [[County Kildare]], which is named after her. Lugh had a son, Ibic, by N<U+00E1>s.<ref>E. J. Gwynn (ed. & trans.), ''The Metrical Dindshenchas'' Vol 3, 1906, [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T106500C/text005.html Poem 5: N<U+00E1>s]</ref> His daughter or sister was [[Ebliu]], who married [[Fintan]]. One of his wives, unnamed, had an affair with [[Cermait]], son of [[the Dagda]]. Lugh killed him in revenge, but Cermait's sons, [[Mac Cuill]], [[Mac Cecht]] and [[Mac Gr<U+00E9>ine]], killed Lugh in return, drowning him in Loch Lugborta. He had ruled for forty years.

===Lugh in other cycles and traditions===
* In the [[Ulster Cycle]] he fathered [[C<U+00FA>chulainn]] with the mortal maiden [[Deichtine]]. When C<U+00FA>chulainn lay wounded after a gruelling series of combats during the ''[[T<U+00E1>in B<U+00F3> Cuailnge]]'' (Cattle Raid of Cooley), Lugh appeared and healed his wounds over a period of three days.
* In ''Baile in Sc<U+00E1>il'' (The Phantom's Trance), a story of the [[Historical Cycle]], Lugh appeared in a vision to [[Conn of the Hundred Battles]]. Enthroned on a da<U+00EF>s, he directed a beautiful woman called the Sovereignty of Ireland to serve Conn a portion of meat and a cup of red [[ale]], ritually confirming his right to rule and the dynasty that would follow him.
* In the [[Fenian Cycle]] the [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] [[harp]]er [[Cn<U+00FA> Deire<U+00F3>il]] claimed to be Lugh's son.
* The [[Luigne]], a people who inhabited Counties [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Sligo|Sligo]], claimed descent from him.

==Lugh<U+2019>s possessions==
Lug possessed a number of magical items, retrieved by the sons of Tuirill Piccreo in Middle Irish redactions of the [[Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn|Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la]]. Not all the items will be listed here. The late narrative ''Fate of the Children of Tuireann'' not only gives a list of items gathered for Lugh. The same romance also endows him with such gifts from the sea god [[Manann<U+00E1>n mac Lir|Manann<U+00E1>n]] as the sword [[Fragarach]], the horse [[Enbarr]] (Aonbarr), the boat Wave-Sweeper, his armor and helmet.

=== Lug's Spear ===
The lore around Lug's Spear is traced as follows:

==== Four Treasures Spear of Lug ====
'''Lugh's spear''' (''sleg''), according to the text of [[The four jewels of the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann|The Four Jewels of the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann]], was an insuperable spear,<ref>Vernam Hall ed.,tr., "The four jewels of the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann," ''Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Celtische Philologie'' 18 (1930) 73-89. "No battle was maintained against the spear of Lug or against him who had it in his hand,"</ref> taken to Ireland from [[Gorias]] (or Findias).<ref name="LGE">Macalister, R. A. S., ed. tr., ''Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn: The Book Of The Taking Of Ireland'', Part IV (1941) [http://www.archive.org/details/leborgablare04macauoft] Lugh's spear is from Gorias in all three recensions (<U+00B6>305, <U+00B6>315, <U+00B6>357).  However, Hull's "Four Jewels" text swaps weapons between owners in the attached verse portion, making it Lug's sword that came from Gorias. Something similar happens in the verse invoked in [[Geoffrey Keating]]'s ''History of Ireland'', and in Comyn ed. tr., Lugh's sword is from Gorias, Lugh's spear is from Findias (Lugh becomes owner of both)</ref>

==== Gae Assail  ====
Lugh obtained the '''Spear of Assal''' (Ir: Gae Assail) as an <U+00E9>ric imposed on the children of Tuirill Piccreo (or Biccreo), according to the short account in ''Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn'' (Poem LXV, <U+00B6>319) <ref name="LGE" />  which adds that the incantation "Ibar (Yew)" made the cast always hit its mark, and "Athibar (Re-Yew)" caused the spear to return.

==== Areadbhar ====
In a full narrative version called ''[A]oidhe Chloinne Tuireann'' (The Fate of the Children of Tuireann),<ref name="ATL4">O'Curry, Eugene, ed. tr. "The Fate of the Chirdren of Tuireann", ''The Atlantis'' IV, London 1863, [http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=y5MEAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA159 157-240].</ref><ref>O'Duffy, Richard J. ed. tr., [http://www.archive.org/details/fateofchildrenof00sociiala ''Oidhe Chloinne Tuireann. The Fate of the Children of Tuireann'']. Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language, Dublin 1888</ref> from copies no earlier than the 18th century, Lugh demands the spear named Ar-<U+00E9>adbair or '''Areadbhair''' (Early Mod. Irish ''A<U+027C><U+00E9>ad<U+1E03>ai<U+027C>'') which belonged to Pisear, king of Persia. Its tip had to be kept immersed in a pot of water to keep it from igniting, a property similar to the [[L<U+00FA>in of Celtchar]]. This spear is also called "Slaughterer"<ref>Joyce, P. W. (Patrick Weston), 1827-1914, tr. "The Fate of the Children of Turenn; or, The Quest for the Eric-Fine", ''Old Celtic Romances''  [http://www.archive.org/details/oldcelticromance00joyciala/ (3rd ed., 1907) (reprint 1920)]</ref> in translation.

==== Finest Yew of the Wood ====
There is yet another name that Lugh's spear goes by: "A [yew] tree, the finest of the wood" (Early Mod. Irish ''e<U+00F3> bo h<U+00E1>ille d'<U+1E1F><U+00ED>o<U+1E0B><U+1E03>ai<U+1E03>''),<ref name="ATL4" p.204/5/> occurring in an inserted verse within ''The Fate of the Children of Tuireann''. And "'''the famous yew of the wood'''" (''ibar alai fhidbaidha'') is also the name that Lugh's spear is called by in a tract which alleges that it, the L<U+00FA>in of Celtchar and the spear Crimall that blinded Cormac Mac Airt were the one and the same weapon (tract in TCD MS 1336 (olim H 3. 17), col. 723, discussed in the [[L<U+00FA>in of Celtchar|L<U+00FA>in]] page).<ref>This tract was recapped by Hennessy, in his introduction, p.xiv, to his edition of ''[[Mesca Ulad]]''. The tract occurs in the manuscript of TCD MS 1336 (olim H 3. 17) immediately after the ''h'' text of the [[Expulsion of the D<U+00E9>isi|Expulsion of the D<U+00E9>ssi]], Kuno Meyer, ''Anecdota'', I, pp.15-24.</ref>

=== Sling-stone ===
Lugh used the '''sling-stone''' (''cloich tabaill'')  to slay his grandfather, Balor the Strong-Smiter in the [[Cath Maige Tuired|Battle of Magh Tuired]] according to the brief accounts in the Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la <U+00C9>renn.<ref>''op. cit.'' <U+00B6>312, <U+00B6>312, <U+00B6>364</ref> The narrative ''Cath Maige Tured'', preserved in a unique 16th century copy, words it slightly different saying that Lugh used the sling-stone (here ''liic talma'' <U+00A7> 133, i.e. ''l<U+00ED>a'' "stone" of the ''tailm'' "sling") to destroy the evil eye of Balor of the Piercing Eye (Bolur Birugderc).<ref>Gray, Elizabeth A. ed. tr., Cath Maige Tuired : the second battle of Mag Tuired ([Dublin] : Irish Texts Society [Series 52] 1982.), [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T300010/index.html English]</ref>

==== Tathlum ====
A certain poem recorded by O'Curry in English translation<ref>O'Curry, Eugene Manners and Customs II, 252. He translates 5 strophes from a poem from a vellum MS "formerly in the possession of Mr. W. Monck Mason, but lately sold at a public auction in London."</ref> says that the missile fired by Lugh was a '''tathlum''' (''t<U+00E1>thluib'' "(slingstone made of) cement").

=== Nature Myth Items ===
Lugh's projectile weapon whether a dart or missile was envisioned by symbolic of lightning-weapon T. F. O'Rahilly.<ref>T. F. O'Rahilly, ''Early Irish History and Mythology'' (1946), pp.60-5</ref> 
Lugh<U+2019>s sling rod was the rainbow and the Milky Way which was called "Lugh's Chain". The spear, which, unlike the rod-sling, he had no need to wield since it was alive and thirsted so for blood that only by steeping its head in a sleeping-draught of pounded fresh poppy seeds could it be kept at rest. When battle was near, it was drawn out; then it roared and struggled against its thongs, fire flashed from it, and it tore through the ranks of the enemy once slipped from the leash, never tired of slaying.<ref>Charles Squire, Chapter 5 "The Gods of the Gaels" in "The Mythology of the British Islands" 1905, republished as "Celtic Myth and Legend," online at http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/cml/</ref>

=== Fragarach ===
Lugh is also seen girt with the Freagarthach (better known as '''[[Fragarach]]'''), the sword of [[Manann<U+00E1>n mac Lir|Manann<U+00E1>n]], in the assembly of the Tuatha D<U+00E9> Danann in the ''Fate of the Children of Tuireann''.

=== Lugh<U+2019>s horse(s) and magic boat ===
Lug had a horse named '''[[Enbarr|Aenbharr]]''' which could fare over both land and sea. Like much of his equipment, it was furnished to him by the sea god Manann<U+00E1>n mac Lir.  When the Children of Tuireann asked to borrow this horse, Lugh begrudged them, saying it would not be proper to make a loan of a loan. Consequently Lugh was unable to refuse their request to use Lugh's currach (coracle) or boat, the '''Wave-Sweeper''' (''Sguaba Tuinne'' (Ir.))<ref>O'Curry tr., p.193, 192n "Scuabtuinn<U+00E9>, that is, the Besom, or Sweeper of the Waves"</ref>

In the [[Lebor Gab<U+00E1>la]],<ref>Macalister ed.,  <U+00B6>319 (loc. cit.)</ref> '''Gainne & Rea''' were the names of the pair of horses belonging to the king of the isle of Sicily [on the (Tyrrhene sea)], which Lug demanded as <U+00E9>ric from the sons of Tuirill Briccreo.

===Lugh<U+2019>s hound Failinis ===
Failinis was the name of the whelp of the King of Ioruaidhe that Lugh demanded as <U+00E9>iric in the [[Tuireann|''Oidhead Chloinne Tuireann'']]. 
This concurs with the name of the hound mentioned in an "[[Ossianic]] Ballad,"<ref>Stern, L. Chr. ed., tr. (into German), in: "Eine ossianische Ballade aus dem XII. Jahrhundert", [http://books.google.com/books?id=s6wCAAAAMAAJ ''Festschrift Whitley Stokes zum siebzigsten Geburtstage''], 1900, pp. 7-12, edited from LL 207b</ref> sometimes referred to by its opening line "D<U+00E1>m Thr<U+00ED>r T<U+00E1>ncatair Ille (They came here as a band of three)". 
In the ballad the hound is called <U+1E60>alinnis (Shalinnis) or Failinis (in the Lismore text),<ref>Wh. Stokes, Book of Lismore, fo. 153 b. recension of the ballad in the Notice on ''Festschrift'' above, in: [http://books.google.com/books?id=_hLEikZQOWYC ''Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Celtische Philologie'', III], p.432-</ref> and belonged to a threesome from Iruaide whom the [[Fianna]] encounter. It is described as "the ancient grayhound.. that had been with Lugh of the Mantles, / Given him by the sons of Tuireann Bicreann;.."<ref>O'Curry, Eugene, "Tri Thruaighe na Sc<U+00E9>alaigheachta (Three Sorrows of Storytelling)" [http://books.google.com/books?id=yOsAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA396 ''The Atlantis''] III, London 1862, 396-7. The four verses excerpted do not include the hound's name.</ref>

{{cquote|That hound of mightiest deeds,<br>
Which was irresistible in hardness of combat,<br>
Was better than wealth ever known,<br>
A ball of fire every night.

Other virtues had that beautiful hound<br>
(Better this property than any other property),<br>
Mead or wine would grow of it,<br>
Should it bathe in spring water.}}

O'Curry's excerpt ends here, but the subsequent verse runs "The three full-fledged heroes are called S<U+00E9>l, Donait and Domhn<U+00E1>n. The dog of the fairest figure, Failinis was brought to Finn".  These threesome also appear in ''[[Colloquy of the Elders|Acallamh na S<U+00E9>norach]]'' though in that work the wonder-dog is called Fer Mac.

==Lugh's name and nature==
Lugh's name was formerly interpreted as deriving from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''leuk-'', "flashing light", and he is often surrounded by solar imagery, so from Victorian times he has often been considered a [[sun god]], similar to the Greco-Roman [[Apollo]] though historically he is only ever equated with [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] (citation?). He appears in folklore as a [[trickster]], and in [[County Mayo]] thunderstorms were referred to as battles between Lugh and Balor, so he is sometimes considered a storm god: [[Alexei Kondratiev]] notes his epithet ''lonnbeimnech'' ("fierce striker") and concludes that "if his name has any relation to 'light' it more properly means 'lightning-flash' (as in [[Breton language|Breton]] ''luc'h'' and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''lughes'')".<ref>Alexei Kondratiev (1997), ''[http://www.mythicalireland.com/mythology/tuathade/lugus.html Lugus: the Many-Gifted Lord]'', accessed 7 January 2006</ref> However, Breton and Cornish are [[Brythonic languages]] in which [[Proto-Celtic]] *''k'' did undergo systematic [[sound change]]s into ''-gh-'' and ''-ch-''.

Conversely, words containing Lu, as in the word Lugh itself, or lo or le have appeared for millennia always meaning light or sun or sun god. [[Luwian Apaliunas]], Hurrian [[Aplu (god)|Aplu]], Etruscan Apulu, Homeric Greek: <U+1F08><U+03C0><U+03CC><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03C9><U+03BD>, that is, (<U+03BB><U+03C9>), Latin [[Apollo]]. The form Apaliunas (]x-ap-pa-li-u-na-a<U+0161>) is attested as a god of Wilusa in a treaty between Alaksandu of Wilusa interpreted as "Alexander of Ilios", and the Hittite great king Muwatalli II ca 1280 BC.

[[Luwian]] is closely related to Hittite, and was among the languages spoken during the second and first millennia BC by population groups in central Anatolia, Anatolia (from Greek A<U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03BB><U+03AE> Anatol<U+0113> <U+2014> "East"; also Asia Minor.
When the [[Illyrians]] migrated to Italy and founded [[Luceria]] in Apulia, a temple to Minerva was built. Minerva is the Etruscan and Roman equivalent of Athena. The arms, ( arament and weapons)  of [[Diomedes]], given to him by [[Athena]] in the [[Trojan War]] were said to be were preserved in her temple.  

The [[Lusitanians]] (or Lusitani in Latin) were an Indo-European people living in the Western Iberian Peninsula.  [[Endovelicus]] was the most important god.  Ant<U+00F3>nio da Visita<U+00E7><U+00E3>o Freire classified the name of "Endovelicus" as a mixed Celtic and Phoenician name, adapted to the Roman language. The End- radical would be from Celtic languages; Bel (or Vel-) would be Phoenician for Lord and - Cus a usual word termination in Latin. The name would suggest Bal, Bel, or Vel, the god [[Belenus]] (also Belenos) was a deity worshipped in Gaul, Britain and Celtic areas of Austria and Spain. In the Roman period Belenus was identified with Apollo. Belisama has been claimed to be the consort of Belenus and she was identified with Minerva/Athena. It would seem that the word Lugh is related to every Indo-European language word meaning light.

Lugh's mastery of all arts has led many to link him with the unnamed Gaulish god [[Julius Caesar]] identifies with [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], whom he describes as the "inventor of all the arts".<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Caes.+Gal.+6.17 6:17]</ref> Caesar describes the Gaulish Mercury as the most revered deity in Gaul, overseeing journeys and business transactions. Juliette Wood interprets Lugh's name as deriving from the Celtic root *''lugios'', "oath", and the Irish word ''lugh'' connotes ideas of "blasphemy, cussing, lies, bond, joint, binding oath",<ref>Alexander McBain (1982), ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Irish Language'' [http://www.ceantar.org/Dicts/MB2/mb25.html Section 25], accessed 7 January 2006</ref> which strengthens the identification with Mercury, who was, among other attributes, a god of contracts.

It is also worth noting that parallels exist between the Irish Lugh, [[Gaulish]] [[Lugus]], German [[W<U+014D>den|Wotan]], the [[English heathenism|English]] Woden and [[Norse paganism|Norse]] [[Odin]]. Odin was worshipped by the Norse as a god of war among other things including poetry and the arts. Odin may have replaced [[Tyr]] as god of war among north Germanic peoples. As such, it may be that Lugh was also worshipped as a god of war by the Irish. On that note it is worth noting that the ultimate Irish warrior hero [[Cu Chulainn]] is cited as the son of Lugh.

==Sacred sites in Ireland==

Some holy sites in Ireland are probably Christianised pagan sacred places originally cult centres for Lugh. Examples include [[Tynagh]] in [[County Galway]].
