The '''Animistic Tradition''' is the terminus for a branch of the so-called 'Old Religion' ([[Wicca]]), founded by the (in the [[United States]]) recognized [[paganism|pagan]] [[priest]] 'Arkana' in Ireland. The 'Animistic Tradition' focuses, as the name suggests, mainly on the emphasis of a [[nature]] in which every thing, even stones, have a [[soul]] ('animus, anima') and therefore are connected to the universal divine. As superior beings a [[Mother Goddess]] and a [[Horned God]]/Lord of the Wilderness are devoted.
