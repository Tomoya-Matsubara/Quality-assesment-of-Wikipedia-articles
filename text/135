==PHOENIX and NIXAL==
History of PHOENIX, the official tech club of Netaji Subhash Engineering College, dates back to 2006, when seven students from the college decided to form a platform that would think beyond just the academic courses that everyone study in the college. With the vision of forming a conglomerate of like minded people and to provide a secure platform to the juniors, these students formed the idea of "Phoenix" - As the Tech-Club. Initial beginning of phoenix was marked by a subscription of Rs. 100 from these 7 seniors, to today, when it has more than thousands of members. Every member of NSEC today is officially a member of Phoenix, and standing now, Phoenix has not only gained the position of "Official Tech Club" of the college, but also has become well known in other colleges.
[[Image:NSECPhoenix.jpg||thumb|left|150px|Phoenix - Tech Club, NSEC]]

The entire functioning of Phoenix now stands on its four pillars, The PR Team, the Creative Team, the Database Team and the Web Team. Today, besides organizing the 3 mega events: '''Avenir''' - the annual tech fest, '''Brainstormer''' - The inter college quiz and '''Kurukshetra''' - the Intra college debate competition, Phoenix holds regular forums. Presently they are: '''The C Forum''', '''The Robotix Forum''', '''The SSPD forum''' and the '''Web Designing Forum''', dedicated to the effort to equip the students with sound technical background and management skills, besides preparing them for campussing and job interviews and always striving for excellence and perfection. "Come, Let's Rise", is the motto of the club<ref>http://www.phoenixnsec.org/intro.asp</ref>
