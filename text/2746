''Biman'' is a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word meaning ''airplane''; it originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[vimana]]'', a name given to a flying machine mentioned in ancient [[Vedas|Vedic]] literature. The logo, painted on the tail, is a stylised white stork (''Balaka'' in Bengali) inside a red circle. The initial livery was a dark blue line extending across the aircraft along the windows and covering the tail section. This was replaced in the 1980s by dark green and red lines, matching the colours of the Bangladesh flag, and has remained in place for over two decades. The ''Balaka'' has also given its name to the Biman headquarters, the ''Balaka Bhaban'' (Balaka Building),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/sep/04/front.html |title=Biman staff threaten to stop all air services on Sept 7 |publisher=The New Age |date=[[2006-09-04]] |accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref> and a landmark sculpture in Dhaka depicting storks is in front of Biman's former headquarters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/sep/10/met.html |title=A unique junkyard sculpture |publisher=The New Age |date=[[2006-09-10]] |accessdate=2007-09-09}}</ref>

On [[4 February]] [[1972]], Biman started its domestic service on the Dhaka<U+2013>Chittagong, Dhaka<U+2013>Jessore and Dhaka<U+2013>Sylhet routes with a [[World War II]] vintage [[Douglas Dakota]] and [[Douglas DC-3]], both gifts from the [[Bangladesh Air Force]].<ref name=Jatree01/><ref name=TheDailyStar20051126/> On [[10 February]] [[1972]], Biman experienced its first accident when the [[Douglas DC-3]] crashed near Dhaka during a flight test, killing all five crew members.<ref name=ASNBiman>{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/operator/airline.php?var=5131 |title= Biman Bangladesh Airlines Accident Reports |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=2007-05-26}}</ref> A [[Douglas DC-6]] was immediately leased from Troll Air, a [[Norway|Norwegian]] airline,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airliners.net/open.file/0114373/M/ |title=Douglas DC-6 leased by Bangladesh Biman from Troll Air |publisher=Airliners.net |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> to keep the domestic service running.<ref name=Jatree01/> On [[4 March]] [[1972]], Biman started its international operations with a once-a-week flight to London using a Boeing 707 chartered from [[British Caledonian]].<ref name=Jatree01/> The short haul fleet was supplemented by a [[Fokker F27]] from [[India]] on [[3 March]] [[1972]] which saw the start of a daily flight between [[Kolkata]] (Calcutta) and Dhaka on [[28 April]] [[1972]].<ref name=Jatree02>The History of Biman Bangladesh Airlines.

In the 2005<U+2013>06 fiscal year, Biman carried 1.15&nbsp;million passengers, a growth of 70% from the previous decade's average. However, with the rise of private domestic carriers in Bangladesh, Biman's market share for domestic passengers dropped by 35% over the previous ten years' average, with only 162,000 passengers travelling with Biman in the domestic sector in the 2005<U+2013>06 fiscal year. During the same period, Biman reported its biggest annual loss of over [[USD|US$]]120&nbsp;million ([[Bangladeshi taka|Tk]]8.3&nbsp;billion), with a US$100&nbsp;million  (Tk6.9&nbsp;billion) loss reported the following year.<ref>{{

== Management ==
The airline was wholly owned by the Bangladesh government through the Bangladesh Biman Corporation since its inception. In 1977, Biman was converted into a public sector corporation which afforded Biman limited autonomy, governed by a board of directors appointed by the government.<ref name=Jatree02/> The authorised share capital was increased to Tk2&nbsp;billion in 1987,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/workgroups/bdlaw/1987-a32.htm |title=Amendment of section 5 of Ord. XIX of 1977 |publisher=The Heidelberg Bangladesh Law Translation Project, from Bangladesh Gazette, Extraordinary |date=[[1987-08-01]] |accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref> and Biman was transformed into a [[public limited company]], the largest in Bangladesh, in 2007.

During the late 1980s, [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], President of Bangladesh at the time, served as president of Biman. After an early period of expansion and growth, Biman entered an era of nose-diving profits and slow growth, exacerbated by incompetent and corrupt management; with padding of purchases, falsified repair bills and unprofitable routes kept in operation for political reasons.<ref name=TheDailyStar061008>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/10/08/d6100801044.htm |title=Nothing impossible in Biman purchase |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2006-10-08]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref name=BBCNews20060830>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5298284.stm |title=Airline's 'lonely hearts' tactic |publisher=BBC News |date=[[2006-08-30]] |accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref> Research conducted in 1996 found that Biman had 5,253 non-flying personnel, 30% more than [[Singapore Airlines]] which had almost a ten-times larger fleet. The report described Biman as "poorly managed, overstaffed, undercapitalized, and subject to excessive political interference in its day-to-day management."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lcgbangladesh.org/Governance/reports/1996-WB-Government%20that%20works.pdf |title=Government that Works: Reforming the Public Sector |publisher=Private Sector Development & Finance Division, Country Department 1: South Asia Region |date=[[1996-07-10]] |accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref>

In the 1992<U+2013>93 fiscal year, accounts under the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism revealed that Tk22&nbsp;million in tax was not paid to the Government. The audit carried out in 1999, also showed that Biman was owed Tk2.2&nbsp;million by travel agents from the proceeds of ticket sales, most likely with the collusion of Biman officials.<ref name=AnnualReport1999>{{cite web |url=http://www.cagbd.org/pdf/annual_report_1999.pdf |title=Annual Report 1999, Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh. |publisher=Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh |date=1999 |accessdate=2007-09-13}}</ref> Additionally, Tk2.4&nbsp;million was overpaid as incentive commission to the sales agents in violation of Biman policies. In 2007, the [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] launched an anti-corruption drive which saw the arrest of Shamim Iskander, the brother of ex-prime minister [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] and a former Biman [[flight engineer]], on multiple corruption charges.<ref name=TheDailyStar070316>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/03/16/d703161501133.htm |title=Clipping the wings |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-03-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> This was shortly followed by the forced retirement of 35 other employees and officials, some of whom were close aides of Iskander.<ref name=TheDailyStar070328>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/03/28/d70328013326.htm |title=35 Biman staff sent on forced retirement |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-03-28]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

=== Privatisation ===
Due to the growing losses, which began in the late 1990s,<ref name=EconomicReview2005>{{cite web |url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/previous_budget/economic_2005/ER_book_2005.pdf |title=Economic Review 2005 |publisher=Bangladesh Ministry of Finance |accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mof.gov.bd/previous_budget/economic_2006/Chapter-11(Eng-06).pdf |title=Transport and Communication Review 2007 |publisher= Bangladesh Ministry of Finance |accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> the government offered 40% of Biman to foreign airlines in 2004, hoping a buyer would take over the management of the carrier. However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain with the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored by outside airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman US$1.6&nbsp;million in consultancy fees with no positive results.<ref name=NewAgeBD061118>{{

In May 2007, the caretaker government approved plans to turn Biman into a Public Limited Company with shareholdings split between seven public sector organisations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/06/06/d70606011710.htm |title=Biman offers its staff voluntary retirement |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-06-06]] |accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> As a part of the restructuring, the government put in place a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to reduce the man-equipment ratio (MER) of 367:1 (ratio of manpower to aircraft).

While Biman management had expected to reduce its workforce by 1,600 personnel, 2,162 applications for VRS were received, many from employees who expected to be dismissed with little or no severance if the quota was not achieved. Biman accepted 1,877 applications and affirmed that key personnel would not be allowed to leave the organisation via VRS.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.southasianmedia.net/cnn.cfm?id=403449&category=Services&Country=BANGLADESH |title= 1863 Biman staff sent into retirement |publisher=South Asian Media Net |date=[[2007-07-03]] |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref><ref name=TheDailyStar20070621/>

While other airlines using modern aircraft are able to provide more personal in-flight experiences via seatback LCD screens, Biman's ageing fleet has maintained the standard equipment available when the planes were manufactured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bimanair.com/intheair/intheair_inflight_video.asp |title=Biman in-flight video |publisher=Biman Bangladesh Airlines |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bimanair.com/intheair/intheair_inflight_audio.asp |title=Biman in-flight audio |publisher=Biman Bangladesh Airlines |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref>

Biman operates a [[frequent flyer programme]] which awards customers with a free round trip flight on production of ticket stubs for ten round trip journeys on Biman. The free ticket is for the route which has been flown the most out of the ten. Journeys on local routes are excluded from the offer.<ref name=FFP/>

An agreement was signed with [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]] in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an [[Electronic ticket|e-ticketing]] solution in order to comply with [[International Air Transport Association]] rules, which set out a deadline of [[31 December]] [[2007]] for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines, such as [[British Airways]], to provide online check-in facilities reducing the need to queue-up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not indicated the adoption of e-ticketing would provide customers with an improved service apart from reducing its own costs and allowing it to meet increasing demand.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.amadeus.com/hk/x65830.html |title=Amadeus ties up with Biman Bangladesh Airlines for e-ticketing |publisher=Amadeus |date=[[2007-04-12]] |accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/12/18/d51218050747.htm |title=Biman asks travel agents not to use Amadeus system for ticket booking |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2005-12-17]] |accessdate=2007-09-16}}</ref> However, the suspension, lasting only a month, was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/01/24/d60124011410.htm |title=Biman resumes ticketing thru' Amadeus |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2006-01-24]] |accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref>

=== Biman Cargo ===
Biman also operates a cargo service using the cargo holds of its passenger aircraft to ship freight to international destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bimanair.com/biman_cargo.asp |title=Biman Cargo |publisher=Biman Bangladesh Airlines |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> It has established a Cargo Village at Zia International Airport where the cargo is packaged and labelled before being loaded onto its aircraft.

While the air cargo industry in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% in the fiscal year 2003<U+2013>04, Biman's cargo operations remained stagnant when private operators such as [[Bismillah Airlines]], Best Aviation and [[Air Bangladesh]] produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000&nbsp;tons of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/09/13/d40913050155.htm |title=Private cargo operators fly high |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2004-09-13]] |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref>

As with its passenger service and management, corruption has also been rife at Biman Cargo. An investigation in 2004 uncovered irregularities in a number of Biman's Middle East operations which deprived the government of millions of dollars in revenue. Biman officials in Dubai were found to have been "extending special privileges" to the main freight handler in exchange for bribes.<ref name=TheDailyStar20040717>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/07/17/d40717011111.htm |title=Biman probe finds huge cargo graft |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2004-07-17]] |accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref> Smuggling of foreign currency and gold bars is reported to have taken place at the Biman Cargo Village by Biman and [[Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh]] (CAAB) employees. A number of arrests have been made but the perpetrators evade punishment through lack of evidence and pressure from the CAAB union.<ref name=TheNewNation20050114>{{cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/26/15478 |title=Syndicates use ZIA as transit for smuggling |publisher=The New Nation |date=[[2005-01-14]] |accessdate=2007-09-20}}</ref>

Biman has air services agreements with 42 countries but operates its routes to 18, leaving room for expansion for which it  lacks aircraft.<ref name=TheDailyStar20070520>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/05/20/d7052001022.htm |title=Steps to make Biman PLC by June approved |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-05-20]] |accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref> The airline operates flights to several destinations in the Middle East, some destinations in South and South East Asia and only two destinations in Europe &ndash; Rome and London. Foreign airlines are encroaching on Biman's routes, particularly the lucrative London<U+2013>Dhaka route which traditionally only Biman and [[British Airways]] have operated direct flights on.<ref name=TheDailyStar20070803/> In 2005, [[Air India]] commenced a route which permitted flights between London and Dhaka without requiring a transit flight which has occupied the space freed up by Biman when it reduced London<U+2013>Dhaka flights.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.airindia.com/article.asp?articleid=286 |title=Air India introduces new flight linking Delhi-Dhaka and Dhaka-Kolkata-London |publisher=Air India |date=[[2005-06-18]] |accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref><ref name=TheDailyStar20070803/> New airlines are also hoping to cash in on Biman's shortfall: [[Air Sylhet]] and [[Royal Bengal Airlines]] are two such airlines launched by expatriate British-Bangladeshis hoping to provide direct flights between London and Dhaka.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airsylhetonline.com |title=Air Sylhet official site |publisher=Air Sylhet |accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalbengalairline.com |title=Royal Bengal Airline official site |publisher=Royal Bengal Airline |accessdate=2007-09-02}}</ref>

=== New York and Manchester ===
From 1993 to 2006, Biman operated flights to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[New York]] from Dhaka via [[Brussels Airport|Brussels]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/07/29/d60729012414.htm |title=Biman makes its last flight to NY today |publisher=The Daily Star|date=[[2006-07-29]]|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination and was kept running despite heavy financial losses on each flight in order to maintain a landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain.<ref name=TheDailyStar060305>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/03/05/d6030501044.htm|title=Biman to reroute NY flight to halve loss|publisher=The Daily Star|date=[[2006-03-05]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through [[Manchester Airport]] in [[England]], capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community in the north of [[England]]. On [[8 April]] [[2006]], Biman's inaugural flight to [[Manchester]] landed at [[Manchester Airport]] en-route to JFK.<ref name=RingwayReports0604>{{cite web|url=http://www.ringwayreports.co.uk/apr06fp.htm|title=Manchester Airport Reports and Images|publisher=Ringway Reports|date=April 2006|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> However, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) had placed the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh]] (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/safety/programs_initiatives/oversight/iasa |title=International Aviation Safety Assessment Program |publisher=FAA |accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US.

The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.<ref name=NewAgeBD060504>{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/may/04/busi.html|title=Biman to suspend NY flights in June|publisher=New Age|date=[[2006-05-04]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref>

[[Image:aircraft.dc-10.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|[[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] landing]]
Previously, the FAA had warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these aircraft did not have the necessary equipment for safely crossing the Atlantic, despite the fact that United States-based [[Northwest Airlines]] operated DC-10 aircraft across the Atlantic until 2006 without any problems.<ref name=NewAgeBD060727>{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/jul/27/front.html|title=Biman not to continue flight to New York|publisher=New Age|date=[[2006-07-27]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref><ref name=BangladeshToday060517>{{cite news |url=http://www.thebangladeshtoday.com/archive/May'06/17-05-2006.htm|title=Biman in a ferrango|publisher=The Bangladesh Today|date=[[2006-05-17]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> On [[13 May]] [[2006]], the FAA refused permission for Biman flight BG011 (DAC-DXB-BRU-JFK) to enter its airspace, citing safety concerns over the ailing DC-10 aircraft being used on the route.<ref name=AeroNewsNetwork060515>{{cite news |url=http://www.aero-news.net/news/commair.cfm?ContentBlockID=a95eb145-a031-4e44-99dc-db331419dc68&Dynamic=1|title=Bangladesh flight banned entry into US over safety issues|publisher=Aero-News Network|date=[[2006-05-15]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> The flight was diverted to [[Montreal Airport]] in [[Canada]] where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey.<ref name=TheDailyStar060516>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/05/16/d6051601033.htm|title=CAAB warned of poor aircraft maintenance|publisher=The Daily Star|date=[[2006-05-16]]|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft and gave it a clean bill of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers.

Biman confirmed that it will reintroduce flights by the deadline of [[24 March]] [[2008]] following which it would permanently lose the right to operate flights on the route.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/issues/2007/10/31/news0757.htm |title=CA asks Biman to operate flights on Dhaka-NY route |publisher=The New Nation |date=[[2007-10-31]] |accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref>

=== Hajj flights ===
The annual [[Islam]]ic pilgrimage to [[Makkah]] for the [[Hajj]] is undertaken by thousands of Bangladesh's predominantly [[Muslim]] population. Biman has been the sole Bangladeshi airline permitted by the government to provide flights for pilgrims. Every year, the commencement of these flights is inaugurated by high ranking government officials including, at times, the Prime Minister.<ref name=TheNewNation20051211>{{cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/38/23763 |title=Khaleda opens Hajj flights |publisher=The New Nation |date=[[2005-12-11]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref><ref name=BBCNews20020207>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1805425.stm |title=Stranded pilgrims fly out of Dhaka |publisher=BBC News | date=[[2002-02-07]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

In 2002, the government opened the service to private operator [[Air Bangladesh]]. The initial private flights were plagued with delays, with both outgoing and return flights postponed for as long as nine days, which caused the Bangladesh government to return the Hajj flights monopoly to Biman.<ref name=BBCNews20020207/>

Biman's handling of Hajj flights has been beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/exec/view.cgi/36/23236 |title=Mir Nasir resigns |publisher=The New Nation |date=[[2005-11-17]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business-class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/nov/13/nat.html |title=Biman prepares for smooth hajj flights |publisher=New Age |date=[[2006-11-13]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights due to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights to cope with the backlog of passengers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2006/dec/11/nat.html |title=Foreign airlines won<U+2019>t offer extra flights for Hajj pilgrims |publisher=New Age |date=[[2006-12-11]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangladeshnews.com.bd/2006/12/16/hajj-still-uncertain-for-thousands-of-pilgrims/ |title=Hajj still uncertain for thousands of pilgrims |publisher=BangladeshNews.com.bd |date=[[2006-12-16]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

In June 2007, the caretaker government approved a three-year Hajj policy aiming to alleviate the problems encountered during the previous two years. Hajj flights would begin leaving from Bangladesh's two other international airports, Shah Amanat International Airport and Osmani International Airport.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/06/17/d70617011711.htm |title=3-yr National Hajj Policy okayed |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-06-17]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> Biman put out a tender for the [[wet lease]] of two aircraft for additional Hajj flights and reached an agreement with [[Phuket Air]].

== Fleet ==

Biman started operations with a gift from the [[Bangladesh Air Force]] of a vintage [[Douglas Dakota]] and [[Douglas DC-3]] which had seen service in [[World War II]].<ref name=TheDailyStar20051126/> Domestic operations commenced with the acquisition of four [[Fokker F27]] aircraft flying passengers to [[Chittagong]] and Sylhet from its base in Dhaka. Shortly afterwards, a [[Boeing 707]], chartered from [[British Caledonian]], joined the airline's fleet, allowing Biman to begin international flights. In 1983, Biman purchased three [[Douglas DC-10]] aircraft from [[Singapore Airlines]] to provide services on its long haul routes.<ref name=TheDailyStar20051126>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/11/26/d5112601011.htm |title=Biman at height of flight disarray |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2005-11-26]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref><ref name=Banglapedia0516/>

For over two decades, the DC-10-30s were Biman's sole widebody airliner and served it well with no notable mechanical problems, a marked contrast to its domestic operations, operated with [[Fokker F28]] and [[BAe ATP]]s, which were routinely out of service due to various problems. In one incident, a government minister deboarded a flight and travelled by road when he learned that the aircraft was a BAe ATP.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2003/10/15/d3101501077.htm |title=Scared minister skips ATP flight, drives to Syedpur |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2003-10-15]] |accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> In January 2003, Biman leased two [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-300]]s which were used on domestic and regional routes for one and a half years.<ref name=AirFleet/> These acted as a replacement for the BAe ATPs.

During the mid 90s, Biman switched its airliner of choice for long-haul routes to the Airbus series of aircraft. Two new [[Airbus A310]]s joined Biman's fleet in 1996 followed by one more in 2000. It has nevertheless maintained its ailing DC-10 fleet which has been banned by several countries (notably the US and the EU member states) for safety concerns. The airline maintains its own ancillary and maintenance facilities at Zia International Airport, where it carries out all maintenance work on F28s, and C-Checks on DC-10<U+2013>30s and A310<U+2013>300s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corporate profile |publisher=Biman Bangladesh Airlines |url=http://www.bimanair.com/aboutus/corporate_profile.asp |accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref>

=== Modernisation ===
[[Douglas DC-10]]s and [[Airbus A310]]s make up most of Biman's international fleet. [[Fokker F28]]s make up the remainder of the fleet for the domestic and regional sectors.<ref name=AirFramesBBC>{{cite web |url=http://www.airframes.org/fleet/bbc |title=Aircraft Registration History |publisher=AirFrames.org |accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> Biman's fleet contains the second to last Douglas DC-10 to come off the production line (l/n 445), and only three other Airbus A310s were produced following Biman's purchase of two new Airbus A310s in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2005/11/02/d51102110182.htm |title=Biman's obsolete planes |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2005-11-02]] |accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> Biman's most recent additions to its fleet are two [[Fokker F28|Fokker F28-4000]]s acquired from [[PBair]] in 2004 at a cost of US$2.91&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thai-aviation.net/Operators%2009.htm |title=Air Operators in Thailand |accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> Both of these aircraft were built in 1977, making Biman's latest acquisitions the oldest aircraft in its fleet.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.weeklyholiday.net/270204/aviatour.html |title=Biman set to purchase two old F-28s |date=[[2004-02-27]] |accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

The ageing fleet has made it difficult for Biman to maintain flight schedules as the aircraft suffer from mechanical problems, leading to flight delays and cancellations.<ref name=TheDailyStar20070803>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/08/03/d7080301138.htm |title=Biman flight schedule about to crash-land |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-08-03]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nation.ittefaq.com/artman/publish/article_37383.shtml |title=Biman<U+2019>s 3 flights delayed for 40 hours: Passengers stranded at ZIA without food, shelter |publisher=The New Nation |date=[[2007-07-07]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref> A number of aircraft have remained grounded due to lack of parts as they are no longer manufactured and used parts are difficult to source.<ref name=TheDailyStar20070710>{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2007/07/10/d7071001033.htm |title=Replacing age-old fleet must for saving Biman |publisher=The Daily Star |date=[[2007-07-10]] |accessdate=2007-08-30}}</ref>

In 2000, Biman put out an [[RFP]] for the acquisition of four wide-bodied aircraft to replace the DC-10s, but both the fleet renewal plans and the airline's expected privatisation were shelved by the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2000/07/18/67929/biman-seeks-aircraft-proposals.html |title=Biman seeks aircraft proposals |publisher=Flight International |date=[[2000-07-18]] |accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> A further attempt was made in 2005 to acquire new aircraft and plans were submitted for the purchase of ten new wide-bodied Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a total cost of US$1&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theindependent-bd.com/details.php?nid=35886 |title=Bangladesh Biman plans fleet renewal  |publisher=The Independent (Bangladesh) |date=[[2005-05-29]] |accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government.

After Biman became a public limited company, fresh moves have been made to procure new generation aircraft to replace its aging fleet. In November 2007, Boeing made an offer to supply Biman four [[Boeing 777-200]] (with option for two additional) to be delivered by 2013 and 4 [[Boeing 787-8]] dreamliner (with option for two additional) to be delivered by 2017 and provide similar aircraft in lease for the interim period starting from 2009. Average price of these aircraft was quoted as USD 165 million. Airbus also made an offer to supply 4 [[Airbus A320]] or [[Airbus A330]] series aircraft at a much lower price than that of Boeing. To manage the fleet in the short run, Biman again floated a tender in January 2008 to purchase/dry lease with option to purchase 2 used [[Airbus A310-300]] aircraft. 

Finally, on March 10, 2008 Biman Management unveiled its plan to procure 8 new generation wide-bodied aircraft from US aircraft manufacturer [[Boeing]] for a total cost of USD 1.265 billion. The 8 aircraft includes 4 [[Boeing 777]]-300ER with average price of USD 182.9 million per unit to be delivered in 2013 (in the months of July, August, October and December) and 4 yet to be launced [[Boeing 787]]-8 Dreamliner with average price of USD 133.31 million per unit to join Biman's fleet in 2017 (in July, August, October and November). The [[Boeing 777]]-300ER will have seating capacity of 463 while the [[Dreamliner]]s will have seating capacity of 394 passengers. A Memorandum of Understanding to be signed with [[Boeing]] by March 15, 2008 with Biman paying USD 1.54 million as booking money and the final agreement to be completed by April 15, 2008. Out of the remaining cost, US-based [[EXIM]] Bank will finance 85% while a syndication of local bank will finance the rest as per the plan. For the interim period, [[Boeing]] will arrange lease of 4 [[Boeing 777]] aircraft to Biman with 2 to be delivered in 2009 while the rest 2 to be delivered by 2010. As part of mordenizing the complete fleet, Biman is now considering an offer from European giant [[Airbus]], who wants to supply Biman with Short to Medium haul aircraft. As per [[Reuters]] report, Airbus is going to make a presentation to Biman Management by March 2008 in this regard.

This long-awaited declaration came at the time when Biman is strugling hard to maintain its already-reduced international flight schedule with its aging fleet that frequently remain grounded with technical difficulties. Biman have cut seven international destinations mostly in Europe and [[Far East]] along with its prestigious New York route due to shortage of new generation fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft, which makes these operations unprofitable. The [[JFK]] authority of New York has already agreed to extend its landing permit to Biman till October 2008 and Biman management is trying to lease some additional aircraft in the interim period to handle the aircraft crisis. Biman has already leased (on [[ACMI]] basis) a 542 seater [[Boeing 747]]-200 from [[Kabo Air]] of [[Nigeria]] for 6 months to operate flights to [[KSA]] and [[UAE]]. Another [[Boeing 747]] is likely to join Biman's fleet.

=== Current fleet ===
As of March 16, 2008, the fleet consists of 11 aircraft, including one aircraft leased from [[Kabo Air]] of Nigeria for 6 months, of which seven or eight are air-worthy.
