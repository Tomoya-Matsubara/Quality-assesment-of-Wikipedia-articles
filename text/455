==Scholarly Contributions==
Pendleton<U+2019>s work is focused in the field of marine and coastal economics where he studies the effects of environmental change on the economics of ocean and coastal use.
 
In 2002, Pendleton published a report titled <U+201C>A Preliminary Study of the Value of Coastal Tourism in Rincon, Puerto Rico<U+201D> assessing the percentage of Rincon<U+2019>s income that has coastal tourism as its source.<ref name=BEACH>{{cite web|title=<U+201C>State of the Beach/State Reports/PR/Beach Access<U+201D>|url=http://www.beachapedia.org/State_of_the_Beach/State_Reports/PR/Beach_Access|publisher=beachapedia.org|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>  Pendleton stated that "should the quality of the coastal and ocean resources of the area become impaired, it is likely that a large portion of Rincon's economy will be lost" and estimated the annual income generated by tourism related to coastal and ocean resources to be greater than $51.9 million.<ref name=BEACH/><ref name=SURF>{{cite web|title=<U+201C>The Good The Bad & The Ugly<U+201D>]|url=http://www.surfingmagazine.com/news/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-surf-first-122208/|publisher=surfingmagazine.com|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>  The information from this 2002 report has been cited as instrumental to the designation of the Tres Palmas Marine Reserve (in 2008) as a marine protected area, resulting in the protection of <U+201C>one of the last remaining elkhorn coral reefs in the Caribbean<U+201D> and the continued status of Rincon as a <U+201C>surfing epicenter<U+201D>.<ref name=SURF/>

Pendleton worked with NOAA in 2005 on the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP) as a nonmarket research specialist.<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web|title=Coastal and Ocean Economics|url=http://www.csc.noaa.gov/newsletter/2005/issue01.pdf|work=Coastal Connections|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=10 May 2011|pages=1-3|date=February/March 2005}}</ref>  The goal of this program was to determine the value of ocean and coastal resources to give coastal managers a <U+201C>better understanding of the value of an area<U+2019>s resources and how important they are to local and national economies.<U+201D><ref name=NOAA/>

In the United States Pendleton has studied water quality off the beaches of Southern California<ref>{{cite web|title=<U+201C>Costs of Closure: Public lecture explores the impacts of bacterial contamination at swimming beaches.<U+201D>|url=http://ciceet.unh.edu/news/releases/pendleton_conference/index.html|publisher=The Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology, University of New Hampshire|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>, looking at the <U+201C>economic contributions<U+201D> of beaches and the impact that water quality has on that <U+201C>contribution<U+201D> including the <U+201C>costs associated with pollution of coastal waters and the economic benefits associated with cleaning them.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|title=<U+201C>Troubled Waters: Science, Policy and the Fight to Preserve Our Natural Resources<U+201D>|url=http://www.environment.ucla.edu/water/news/article.asp?parentid=650|publisher=UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>  His studies have included an investigation (in 2006) of the costs of health care and time missed from work by beachgoers due to illness related to low water quality at several South California beaches.<ref name=ESE/>

Also in Southern California, Pendleton<U+2019>s research on behalf of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Foundation played a role in instituting the Marine Life Protection Act, creating marine reserves off Westward Beach, Point Dume and Paradise Cove (in 2009).  Pendleton<U+2019>s study surveyed California residents about their visits to the coast and determined that <U+201C>more than 90 percent of visits to the Southern California coast are for <U+2018>non consumptive<U+2019> activities such as scuba diving, tide-pooling and surfing, and that such <U+2018>non-take<U+2019> activities bring more money to coastal economies than <U+2018>consumptive activities<U+2019> like fishing.<U+201D><ref name=MALI>{{cite web|title=<U+201C>Fishermen, enviros butt heads over MLPA survey results<U+201D>|url=http://www.malibutimes.com/articles/2009/09/02/news/news3.txt|publisher=Malibu Times|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>  Data collected related to the impact visits to the coast have on coastal economies showed that consumptive visits brought $2.5 million to these economies while non-consumptive visits were the source of an almost $115 million.<ref name=MALI/>

During his time at The Ocean Foundation<U+2019>s Coastal Ocean Values Center in 2008, Pendleton coauthored and edited a book published titled <U+201C>The Economic and Market Value of Coasts and Estuaries: What<U+2019>s At Stake?<U+201D> which presented the findings of a study assessing <U+201C>the economic value of the nation<U+2019>s coastal areas in excess of hundreds of billions of dollars<U+201D>.<ref name=CLF>{{cite web|title=Experts Say U.S. Coasts and Estuaries Contribute Billions to Economy, but Much is at Risk|url=http://www.clf.org/newsroom/experts-say-u-s-coasts-and-estuaries-contribute-billions-to-economy-but-much-is-at-risk-new-report-from-restore-america%E2%80%99s-estuaries-and-the-ocean-foundation-shows-high-economic-value-of-coa/|publisher=Conservation Law Foundation|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>  The study also found that although estuaries and coasts cover a small percentage of the total land area of United States (only 13%) they are home to 43% of the United States<U+2019> population and produce 49% of the its economic output.<ref name=CLF/>  In discussion of the findings of the study, Pendleton said <U+201C>We are only now coming to grips with the enormity of the economic value and potential from sustainable uses of our coastal resources, and more importantly, the potential economic losses we suffer each year because of underinvestment in coastal protection and restoration.<U+201D><ref name=CLF/>

Also during his time at The Coastal Ocean Values Center Pendleton collaborated on a reference guide titled <U+201C>Coral Reefs, Mangroves and Seagrass Economic Values: A Global Compilation<U+201D> (2008) which compiled statistics on the economic value of marine resources with the goal of providing that information to managers and planners of marine and coastal development to promote sustainable development of coastal and marine areas.<ref name=CINT>{{cite web|title=How Much are Ocean Resources Worth?|url=http://www.conservation.org/newsroom/pressreleases/Pages/how_much_are_ocean_resources_worth.aspx|publisher=Conservation International|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>  Regarding the contents and purpose of the guide, Pendleton said <U+201C>This guide will give planners and conservationists scientific evidence of the economic importance of the other values provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and sea grasses.<U+201D><ref name=CINT/>

His current policy initiatives at the Nicholas Institute of Environmental Policy at Duke University include: Rethinking the Funding and Management of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, Ocean Users and Marine Spatial Planning in the United States, Marine Ecosystem Services Partnership, The Economics of Blue Carbon, Fisheries Sustainability and Leadership Forum, Marine Spatial Planning for the Deep Sea, and Economic Change in Three California Estuaries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicholas Institute Ocean and Coastal Policy Department Home Page|url=http://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/oceans/|publisher=Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> 

Some of Pendleton<U+2019>s most recent work is focused on rethinking the operation, maintenance, and management funding of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.<ref name=BOATUS>{{cite web|last=Lydecker|first=Ryck|title=Rethinking a Waterway at Eight Knots|url=http://www.boatusmagazine.com/boatus/20110405?pg=40#pg42|work=BoatU.S. Magazine|publisher=BoatU.S.|accessdate=10 May 2011|pages=40-42|date=April/May 2011}}</ref>  As part of this work he undertook an expedition aboard his personal vessel, ''Indicator'', travelling up the Waterway from the Duke Marine Lab in Beaufort, NC to the Chesapeake Bay in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beamon|first=Cindy|title=Duke prof studying Intracoastal Waterway|url=http://www.dailyadvance.com/node/65614|publisher=The Daily Advance|accessdate=10 May 2011|date=August 16|year=2010}}</ref>   At the end of the expedition, Pendleton convened a policy lab in Washington, DC to bring together stakeholders interested in the Waterway<U+2019>s future such as governmental agency officials, commercial and recreational Waterway users, environmental scientists and economists.<ref name=BOATUS/>  The policy lab was convened at the request of Congressman Mike McIntyre and was planned as the first of a series of three meetings to discuss the Waterway.<ref name=BOATUS/>  Pendleton<U+2019>s purpose in planning an expedition prior to the policy lab was to gain a <U+201C>sea level perspective<U+201D> of the challenges the waterway faced stating: <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t think you can speak credibly about managing the waterway without spending time on it. When you<U+2019>re at the helm, it<U+2019>s a completely different story.<U+201D><ref name=BOATUS/>
