'''Herm''' ([[Guern<U+00E9>siais]]: ''Haerme'') is the smallest of the [[Channel Islands]] that is open to the public and is part of the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]]. It is one and a half miles long, and under half a mile wide; orientated North-South. [[Auto-free zone|Cars are banned]] from the island, as are bicycles; but, [[All-terrain vehicle|quad bike]]s and [[tractor]]s used for staff and luggage transport respectively are allowed. It is located to the north-west of France, and the south of England; with Guernsey on the west and Jersey to the south-east. It is in the [[English Channel]].

Herm was first discovered in the [[Mesolithic]] period, and the first settlers arrived in the [[Neolithic Age|Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] Ages. Many tombs from that period remain today, the majority in the north of the island. The island was annexed to the [[Duchy of Normandy]] in 933, but returned to the Crown with the division of Normandy in 1204. It was occupied by Germans in the [[Second World War]], but was largely bypassed. Herm is currently managed by Herm Island Ltd, formed by Starboard Settlement, who acquired Herm in 2008, following fears that the island's identity was at threat.

==History==
[[Image:Hermdunord.jpg|left|thumb|The common in the north of the island. Standing stones can be seen on the grass, while the island of [[Sark]] lies in the background.]]

===Ancient history to Middle Ages===
Herm was first found in the [[Mesolithic]] period (between 10,000 and 8,000 B.C), when hunters were in search of food.<ref name="History">{{cite web | url=http://herm.com/files/pdf/History_-_16th_to_21st_Century.pdf | title=History <U+2013> Up to the 16th Century | publisher=Herm Island | accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref> In the [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze age]]s, settlers arrived; the remains of [[chamber tomb]]s have been found on the island, and may be seen today; specifically on the Common, and the Petit and Grand Monceau;<ref name="History"/> it has been suggested that the northern end of the island, i.e. the Common, was set apart for burials.<ref name="Durham"/> After a three-year project by the [[University of Durham]], supported by specialists from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], and the Guernsey museum, they stated that the "density of tombs suggests that the northern end of Herm may have been a place set apart for funerary activity".<ref name="Durham">{{cite web | url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/herm.project/ | title=Introduction | work=Durham University | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>
[[Image:Roberts Cross Herm.jpg|thumb|right|A prehistoric grave known as Robert's Cross.]]

The first records of Herm's inhabitants in historic times are from the 6th century, when the island became a centre of [[Monasticism|monastic activity]]; the followers of [[Saint Tugual]] (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing [[Saint Tugual's Chapel]].<ref name="History"/> In 709, a storm washed away the strip of land which connected the island with [[Jethou]].<ref name="Island life">{{cite web | url=http://www.islandlife.org/herm.htm | title=Welcome to the Herm Home Page | work=Island Life | date=2011 | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref>

An important moment in Herm's political history was in 933, when the [[Channel Islands]] were annexed to the [[Duchy of Normandy]],<ref name="History "/><ref name="Annex">{{cite web | url=http://www.iexplore.com/travel-guides/europe/united-kingdom/channel-islands/sark-and-herm/history-and-culture | title=Sark and Herm Travel Guide | work=iExplore | accessdate=31 December 2013}}</ref> they remained so until the division of [[Normandy]] in 1204, when they became a British [[Crown Dependency]].<ref name="Legal">{{cite web | url=http://herm.com/files/pdf/History_-_Legal_Dispositions.pdf | title=Legal Dispositions of Herm Island | publisher=Herm Island | accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>` After the annexation, Herm gradually lost its monastic inhabitants, and between 1570 and 1737 the governors of Guernsey used it as a hunting ground; visiting to shoot, hunt, and fish.<ref name="History"/><ref name="Annex "/>

===19th century to World War II===

In 1810, an inn was founded; and during the [[Industrial Revolution]], roads, paths, a harbour, accommodation, a forge, blacksmiths, a brewery, a bakery and a prison were built to cater for the largest number of inhabitants since prehistoric times.  Most were quarrymen working in new [[granite]] quarries.<ref name="History"/> Several quarries can still be seen at present, such as on the Common.<ref name="History"/> When the Prince<ref name="History "/> and [[Evelyn Princess Bl<U+00FC>cher|Princess Bl<U+00FC>cher]]<ref>{{cite book |author=Evelyn, Princess Bl<U+00FC>cher |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=An English Wife in Berlin |year=1921 |publisher=Constable |location=London |page=1 |quote= | url=http://www.archive.org/stream/englishwifeinber00bluoft#page/1/mode/1up |isbn= }}</ref> leased the island from the British government during the [[First World War]], he introduced a colony of [[Red-necked wallaby|Red-necked wallabies]] to the island,<ref>{{cite book |author=Bl<U+00FC>cher, Evelyn |title=An English Wife in Berlin |publisher=E.

The [[German occupation of the Channel Islands]] during World War II essentially by-passed Herm. The island was claimed on 20 July 1940 by the [[Third Reich]],<ref name="History"/>; a few weeks after the arrival of German troops in [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]], [[German soldier]]s landed on the island to shoot a propaganda film, ''The Invasion of the [[Isle of Wight]].''<ref name="History"/> Herm's sandy beaches were soon used for practising landings from barges, in preparation for the [[Operation Sealion|invasion of England]], but otherwise the island saw little of the Germans beyond officers making trips to shoot rabbits.<ref name="WWII Book">{{cite web | title=A Boy Messenger's War | publisher=Kingate Press | date=1995 | accessdate=30 December 2013 | author=Le Page, Martin}}</ref> Herm had only a little German construction during the war; a [[flak|flak battery]] was placed on the island, and mines were placed in an area.<ref name="WWII Book" />

====Operation Huckaback====
[[Operation Huckaback]] was a British WWII military operation, which was originally designed to be a raid on Herm, Jethou and Brecqhou, but instead was only a raid on Herm alone of the channel islands on the night of 27 February 1943, following an earlier attempt which was aborted.<ref name="Messenger">{{cite book | title=The Commandos: 1940<U+2013>1946 | publisher=William Kimber | author=Messenger, Charles | year=1985 | isbn=0718305531}}</ref> Ten men of the [[Small Scale Raiding Force]] and [[No. 4 Commando]] under Captain [[Patrick Anthony Porteous]] {{Post-nominals|VC}} landed 200 yards to the north-west of Selle Rocque on a shingle beach and made several unsuccessful attempts to climb the cliff in front of them.<ref name="Messenger" /> Porteous finally managed to climb up the bed of a stream and pulled the others up with a rope.<ref name="Messenger" /> They later reported that they had found no sign of any Islanders or Germans (who were supposed to be billeted near the harbour).<ref name="Messenger" />

===Since 1945===
In 1949, the [[States of Guernsey]] bought Herm from [[The Crown|the Crown]] due to the "unspoilt island idyll that could be enjoyed by locals and tourists alike".<ref name="Independent"/> One of the island's most influential tenants was Major Peter Wood, who looked after the island from 1949 to 1980 with his wife.<ref name="Independent"/><ref name="Staff "/> The island was run down when he arrived, with the manor hidden in undergrowth, the windows and roofs of the houses being blown off by a sea mine drifting into the harbour shortly after their arrival,<ref name="tig">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisguernsey.com/latest/2006/03/20/a-life-less-ordinary/|title=A Life Less Ordinary|date=20 March 2006|accessdate=29 June 2013}}</ref> but they created a school, and restored St Tugual's Chapel.<ref name="Staff">{{cite web | url=http://herm.com/files/pdf/staff_handbook_2013.pdf | title=Herm Island Staff Handbook 2013 | publisher=Herm Island | date=2013 | accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> Major Wood's daughter Pennie Wood Heyworth and her husband Adrian succeeded them;<ref name="Staff"/> Major Wood died in 1998.<ref name="Staff"/> Their early efforts are recorded in ''Herm, Our Island Home'', written by Major Wood's wife Jenny Wood.<ref name="hoih">{{cite book|title=Herm, Our Island Home|first=Jenny|last=Wood|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|date=27 July 1972|isbn=0709134193}}</ref>
