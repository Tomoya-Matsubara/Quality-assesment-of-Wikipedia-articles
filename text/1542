'''Tool''' is a Grammy-Winning American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], formed in 1990. Since their inception, the band's line-up has included drummer [[Danny Carey]], guitarist [[Adam Jones (musician)|Adam Jones]], and vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]]. The current bassist is [[Justin Chancellor]], who has been with the band since 1995. Tool is known to have rigorous touring schedules in support of their albums, they have performed well on charts worldwide, and have sold an estimated 9.25 million records in the US alone.

Tool emerged with a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound on their first studio album, <!--Undertow was Tool's first full-length album; Opiate was only an EP, and does not need mention here-->''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'', at a time when the genre was dominated by [[thrash metal]]; and later became a dominant act in the [[alternative metal]] movement with the release of their second effort, ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'', in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, [[visual arts]], and a message of personal evolution continued with their third album, ''[[Lateralus]]'', in 2001; and their most recent album, ''[[10,000 Days]]'', released in 2006, gained the band critical acclaim and success around the world.

Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of [[progressive rock]] and [[art rock]]. The relationship between the band and today's [[music industry]] is ambivalent, at times marked by [[Censorship of music|censorship]] and the band members' insistence on [[privacy]].

=== ''Undertow'' (1993<U+2013>1995) ===
The following year, at a time when [[alternative rock]] was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, ''[[Undertow (Tool album)|Undertow]]'' (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than ''Opiate'' and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound.<ref name="Jones a Master of Many Trades"/> The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in [[Hollywood]] but learned at the last minute that the Garden Pavilion belonged to [[L.

On October 1, 1996, Tool released their second full-length album, '''''<U+00C6>nima''''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8><U+0252>n<U+026A>m<U+0259>}})<ref>[http://toolshed.down.net/faq/faq.html The Tool FAQ], G2.</ref> in [[Compact Disc]] format and in [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] format on October 15, 1996. The album was recorded and cut at [[Ocean Way]], [[Hollywood, California]] and [[The Hook]], [[North Hollywood, California]] from 1995 to 1996.  It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|triple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on March 4, 2003.<ref>{{Cite web | last =Theiner | first =Manny | title =Concert Review: Tool's prog pleases populace | work =Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | year =2006 |date=2006-09-28 | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06271/725443-42.stm |quote =...from its triple-platinum 1996 release, "Aenima." }}</ref>

The title ''<U+00C6>nima'' (pronounced ON-ima) is a combination of the words '[[Anima (Jung)|anima]]' (Latin for 'soul' associated with  the ideas of "life force" and a term often used by [[Psychology|psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]]) and '[[enema]]' the medical procedure. <ref>Radio interview which can be downloaded from the band's website.</ref> 

After Paul D'Amour left Tool, Justin Chancellor came on board, and the recording of the already-begun ''[[<U+00C6>nima]]'' continued. The band enlisted the help of producer [[David Bottrill]], who had produced some of [[King Crimson]]'s albums while Jones collaborated with [[Cam de Leon]] to create ''<U+00C6>nima'''s Grammy-nominated artwork. 

The album was dedicated to [[Satire|satirist]] [[Bill Hicks]], who had died two and a half years earlier.<ref name="Stepping Out From the Shadows"/> The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".<ref name="austinkeenanhicks">{{cite news

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported ''Lateralus'' and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with [[King Crimson]] in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as "the once and future kings of progressive rock". Keenan stated of the minitour: "For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like [[Lenny Kravitz]] playing with [[Led Zeppelin]], or [[Britney Spears]] onstage with [[Debbie Gibson]]."<ref name="kingcrimsonminitour"/>

===Musical style===
A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of [[Time signature#Complex time signatures|unusual time signatures]]. For instance, bassist [[Justin Chancellor]] describes the time signature employed on ''[[Lateralus|Lateralus']]'' first single, "[[Schism (song)|Schism]]", as 6.5/8, and that it later "goes into all kinds of other times".<ref name="bassplayer052001">{{cite journal

Beyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his musical scope. [[Bass Player (magazine)|''Bass Player'' magazine]] described Chancellor's bass playing as a "thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility".<ref name="bassplayer052001"/> As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a [[Wah-wah (music)|wah effect]] by [[Hammer-on|hammering]] "the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep", such as on the song "The Patient" (''Lateralus'' 2001).<ref name="bassplayer052001"/>

Completing the band's [[rhythm section]], drummer Danny Carey uses [[polyrhythm]]s, [[tabla]]-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to trigger samples, such as prerecorded [[tabla]] and [[octoban]] sounds.<ref name="moderndrummer072006"/>

Maynard James Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'': After his performance during an [[Alice in Chains]] reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as "a natural fit at replacing [[Layne Staley]]".<ref>{{cite web
