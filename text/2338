"'''Schei<U+00DF>e'''" (English: ''Shit'') is a song by American recording artist [[Lady Gaga]] from her second studio album, ''[[Born This Way]]'' (2011). The song is written and produced by Lady Gaga and [[RedOne]], and was recorded in Europe on the tour bus during the [[Monster Ball Tour]].  "Schei<U+00DF>e" was first introduced as a remix during a [[Thierry Mugler]] fashion show held in January&nbsp;19,&nbsp;2011. Gaga later performed the first verse and the chorus during the 2011 season finale of ''[[Germany's Next Topmodel]].''

"Schei<U+00DF>e" is a [[dance-pop]] song with heavy, pounding [[synths]]. The song also has a fast [[techno]] beat with [[electroclash]] and [[Eurodisco]] influences. Gaga speaks the first verse and parts of the [[Refrain|chorus]] of the song in German, as the name of the song is German. The song has a feminist tone, with lyrics speaking of female [[empowerment]]. The song received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who complimented its heavy dance beat and catchy chorus, despite criticizing the German lyrics and Gaga's accent. Reviewers also considered it a highlight of the album, and found influences of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s work. The song charted on the South Korean and American national charts, as well as charting on alternate charts in Canada, Germany and the Untied States.

"Schei<U+00DF>e" was written and produced by Lady Gaga and [[RedOne]].

The next day, she wrote "Schei<U+00DF>e", stating that she "meant [the song] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with. Anything that gets in your way from being brave.
