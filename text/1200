==Plot summary==
[[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] is excited to have a new family, but his step-kids don't warm up to him. He finds out from Donna about a father-daughter dance, the Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance, and tries to coax his new step-daughter [[Roberta Tubbs|Roberta]] into going with him. She is at first annoyed and unwilling to go, but eventually accepts when he buys her a set of diamond earrings. Cleveland decides to buy a cake to celebrate. As he backs out of the driveway, he accidentally runs over the family dog, [[Meadowlark Lemon|Meadowlark Lemon]]. In an attempt to keep this a secret, Cleveland allows his neighbor Lester to dispose of the body. Lester later eats the dog. Cleveland realizes that he has to tell his family after being advised by Tim. They are shocked and angry. Roberta refuses to go to the dance with her step-dad, and instead wants to go with her father Robert. He attempts to patch things up by buying a new dog but Rallo says that his dog is not replaceable. Cleveland angrily tells Rallo to move on before going to be there for Roberta. He arrives at the high school to find out that Robert has bailed out on Roberta again, so he goes to the dance anyways to be there for Roberta.<ref>http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&mo=9&d=27</ref>

Meanwhile, after being seen kissing his dad goodbye on the cheek, [[Cleveland Brown, Jr.|Cleveland Jr.]] is harassed by everyone at school, including the gym teacher, calling him Beth, until the students find him useful as a "door" for the doorless stalls in the boys' bathroom. This leads to Junior becoming a self-appointed [[bathroom attendant]], until Cleveland finds out and tells him to stop it because he looks like "a racist cliche in a [[Ron Howard]] movie." He tells his son to boil his clothes and that tomorrow he will teach him how to play baseball.

==Cultural references==
*While using her laptop, Roberta clicks on a link that directs her to a video of Cleveland [[Ghost riding|dancing around a moving car]]. The song that plays during the video is [[E-40]]'s "[[Tell Me When To Go]]".
*Cleveland plans to buy a [[Baskin-Robbins]] ice-cream cake, and says he hasn't been so excited since he won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]]. The scene [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cuts]] to a parody of [[Halle Berry]]'s 2001 Best Actress acceptance speech, with Cleveland as Berry.
*In an effort to win Roberta over, Cleveland and Rallo perform [[Lionel Richie]]'s 1983 hit "[[All Night Long (All Night)|All Night Long.]]" Then Cleveland Jr. enters dressed like Prince with the same hair cut, purple outfit, and guitar that Prince is best known for owning during his ''[[Purple Rain]]'' phase.
*While searching for the family dog in a meat slurry chute behind a chicken gizzard cannery, Cleveland comments "This place smells like [[Chlo<U+00EB> Sevigny]]." When Rallo asks "Who's that?" Cleveland replies "Just some gross indie porno actress."
*Donna asks Cleveland why he wasn't more up-front with everyone about the death of their dog. Cleveland figures that he "[[Death of Kurt Cobain|took the easy way out]]" like [[Kurt Cobain]]. It cuts to a scene where [[Courtney Love]] is farting in bed and asks Cobain to make love to her. Cobain hesitantly answers that he is going to "grab something out of the garage."
*After the death of the family dog, Cleveland buys a new one, which he names [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Rallo is not impressed and says "You can't just replace my dog like [[Brad Pitt]] replaced [[Jennifer Aniston]], or [[John Mayer]] replaced Jennifer Aniston, or [[Vince Vaughn]] replaced Jennifer Aniston," referring to the actress' highly-publicized personal life.
