The '''Walden <U+2013> Wallkill Rail Trail''', also known as the '''Jesse McHugh Rail Trail''', is a {{convert|3.22|mi|km|adj=on}} [[rail trail]] between the [[Walden, New York|village of Walden]] in the [[Montgomery (town), New York|town of Montgomery]] and the [[Wallkill, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Wallkill]] in the [[Shawangunk, New York|town of Shawangunk]]. Montgomery and Shawangunk are located in [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties, respectively, in [[upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York]].

The trail is part of the former [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]]'s rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]]. The land was purchased by the towns of Montgomery and Shawangunk in 1985 and converted to a public trail. The portion of the trail in Shawangunk was formally opened in 1993 and named after former [[town supervisor]] Jesse McHugh. Plans to pave the trail between Walden and Wallkill were discussed since 2001, and the route was finally paved between 2008 and 2009. The trail also includes an unofficial, unimproved section to the north of Wallkill, and intersects with both [[New York State Route 52|NY 52]] and [[New York State Route 208|NY 208]].

==History==
[[Image:WVRR 1899.jpg|thumb|left|The original Wallkill Valley rail line, stretching from Montgomery to Kingston]]
Stretching {{convert|33|mi|km}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=40}}</ref> from [[Montgomery (town), New York|Montgomery]] to [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=50<U+2013>51}}</ref> the [[Wallkill Valley Railroad]] operated from 1866<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=10}}</ref> until its last regular freight run on December 31, 1977.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=135}}</ref> In the 1980s, [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]], then the owner of the Wallkill Valley line, attempted to sell the former rail [[Transport corridor|corridor]]. The towns of Montgomery and [[Shawangunk, New York|Shawangunk]] <U+2013> in [[Orange County, New York|Orange]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties, respectively<ref name="perls-343" /> <U+2013> purchased their sections of the rail line to allow "development of a commercial corridor [as well as] utility [[easement]]s and access" to a local [[reservoir]].<ref name="official-montgomery" />

The Montgomery section consisted of {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the [[Walden, New York|village of Walden]] to the town line with Shawangunk, and the Shawangunk section ran {{convert|2.3|mi|km}} north from the town line to Birch Road. The purchases were completed in August and October 1985, respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|p=142}}</ref> In November of that year, the [[New York State Department of Correctional Services]] bought {{convert|1.4|mi|km}} of the former corridor in Shawangunk's [[Wallkill, Ulster County, New York|hamlet of Wallkill]], near the [[Wallkill Correctional Facility]]. This portion extends from Birch Road to the town line with [[Gardiner, New York|Gardiner]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Mabee|1995|pp=140, 142}}</ref> The [[Shawangunk Correctional Facility]] was built at that location.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090601/COMM/906010315/-1/NEWS |title=Wallkill Rail Trail could double in size |first=Adam |last=Bosch |date=2009-06-01 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> South of Walden, the corridor remains an active rail line operated by the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].<ref name="official-montgomery" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nysdot.gov/divisions/operating/opdm/passenger-rail/passenger-rail-repository/2010%20NYS%20Rail%20Map.pdf |title=Railroads in New York State <U+2013> 2010 |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-12-28 |publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]] |format=PDF}}</ref>

North of the prisons, the former corridor continues as the separate [[Wallkill Valley Rail Trail]].<ref name="perls-343" /> Rail trail enthusiasts have been trying to find a way to combine the two rail trails since the 1990s,<ref name="mabee-144" /> and in 2004 the town of Shawangunk commissioned an [[Open space reserve|open space]] study that identified possible ways to accomplish such a connection.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shawangunk.org/pdf/enviro/Shawangunk-Open-Space-Analysis.pdf |title=Town of Shawangunk Open Space Inventory and Analysis |publisher=[[Conway School of Landscape Design]] |location=Conway, MA |date=March 2004 |first1=Angela |last1=Sisson |first2=Crystal |last2=Hitchings |first3=Joshua |last3=Clague |pages=68<U+2013>69 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> A 2008 Ulster county transportation plan included projects to connect the trails.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.co.ulster.ny.us/planning/uctc/documents/nmtp/final_plan.pdf |title=Ulster County Non-Motorized Transportation Plan |date=December 2008 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |publisher=Ulster County Transportation Council |location=Kingston, NY |format=PDF |pages=25}}</ref>

== Route of the trail ==
[[Image:Walden trailhead.jpg|thumb|left|The trailhead in the village of Walden]]
The trail begins at the {{convert|9.4|acre|ha|adj=on}} Wooster Grove Park in the village of Walden, near [[New York State Route 52|NY 52]].<ref name="rec" /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hvparent.com/articlepost.aspx?id=942 |title=Hit the bike trail |publisher=Hudson Valley Parent |accessdate=2010-12-25}}</ref><ref name="perls-344" /> There is a visitor center for rail trail users at the park. The park also contains Walden's former [[train station]], which has since been renovated as a recreational facility.<ref name="rec">{{Cite web |url=http://waldenrec.org/Rec_Department.pdf |title=Park Description and Program Schedules |publisher=Village of Walden Recreation and Parks |location=Walden, NY|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-12-26}}</ref>

The trail continues {{convert|1|mi|km}} north from the [[trailhead]] before reaching Lake Osiris Road, continuing another {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km}} to the Montgomery<U+2013>Shawangunk town line.<ref name="perls-344" /> Once in Shawangunk, the trail passes by the Borden Estate,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shawangunk.org/pdf/business/business-directory.pdf |title=Business and Resource Directory |publisher=Town of Shawangunk |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2010-12-26 |format=PDF}}</ref> a mansion built in 1906 by the granddaughter of [[Gail Borden]].

[[Image:Wallkill trailhead.jpg|thumb|right|The trailhead in the hamlet of Wallkill]]
About {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} from the town line, the trail reaches its Wallkill trailhead bordering [[New York State Route 208|NY 208]], directly across the street from the Shawangunk police station.<ref name="perls-344">{{Harvnb|Perls|2003|p=344}}</ref> The paved section between Walden and Wallkill is flat, with only a 3% [[Grade (slope)|grade]].<ref name="official-montgomery" /> A portion of the former corridor in central Wallkill has since been converted to a road.<ref name="mabee-144" />

There is an unimproved northern section in Wallkill that extends {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km}} from the intersection of Railroad Avenue and C. E. Penny Drive to Birch Road.<ref name="perls-343">{{Harvnb|Perls|2003|p=343}}</ref> Birch Road marks the border between the former corridor and two state prisons.<ref name="mabee-144" /> This section passes through private hunting grounds<ref name="perls-344" /> and is "unmarked [with] no signs" but is "arguably... the most scenic" portion of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor, featuring "splendid" views of the [[Shawangunk Ridge]] to the west.<ref name="perls-343" />

While the total length of the trail is officially only about {{convert|3|mi|km}},<ref name="rec" /> the inclusion of the northern section increases its length to about {{convert|4+1/2|mi|km}}.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090306/SPORTS/90306023 |title=Guide to area multi-use trails |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2010-12-26 |newspaper=[[Times Herald-Record]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones Local Media Group]] |location=Middletown, NY}}</ref> The trail is used for walking, jogging, bicycling and dog walking.<ref name="perls-343" />
