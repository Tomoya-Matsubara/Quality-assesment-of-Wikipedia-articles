'''Ren<U+00E9> Bourque''' (pronounced reh-NAY BOHRK) (born December 10, 1981) is a professional [[ice hockey]] [[winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] who currently plays for the [[Calgary Flames]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).  An undrafted player, Bourque was signed by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] as a free agent in 2004 after spending four years at the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]].  He began his professional career with the [[Norfolk Admirals]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL) where he won [[Dudley "Red" Garrett Memorial Award|Rookie of the Year]] honours in [[2004<U+2013>05 AHL season|2005]].
