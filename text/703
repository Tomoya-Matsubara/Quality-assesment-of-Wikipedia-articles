"'''We Are the World'''" is a 1985 song and [[charity single]] recorded by the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[USA for Africa]]. It was written by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Lionel Richie]], and co-produced by [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Michael Omartian]] for the album ''[[We Are the World (album)|We Are the World]]''. Following [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" project in the UK, an idea for the creation of an American benefit single for African famine relief came from activist [[Harry Belafonte]], who, along with fundraiser [[Ken Kragen]], was instrumental in bringing the vision to reality. Several musicians were contacted by the pair, before Jackson and Richie were assigned the task of writing the song. Following several months of working together, the duo completed the writing of "We Are the World" one night before the song's first recording session, in early 1985. The last recording session for the song was held on January 28, 1985. The historic event brought together some of the most famous artists in the music industry at the time.

The song was released on March 7, 1985, as the only single from the album. A worldwide commercial success, it topped music charts throughout the world and became the fastest-selling American pop single in history. The first ever single to be [[music recording sales certification|certified]] multi-platinum, "We Are the World" received a 4<U+00D7> certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. However, the song garnered mixed reviews from journalists, music critics and the public. Fans enjoyed hearing racially and musically diverse recording artists singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying "We Are the World", knowing that the money was going to charity. Other individuals, such as those in the rock community, were disappointed that the song did not challenge why famines occur in the first place, and felt that the lyrics were self-aggrandizing.

Honored numerous times<U+2014>including three [[Grammy Awards]], one [[American Music Award]] and a [[People's Choice Award]]<U+2014>the song was promoted with a critically received music video, a home video, a special edition magazine, a [[simulcast]], and several books, posters and shirts. The promotion and merchandise aided the success of "We Are the World", which was eventually named the biggest selling single of all time. As of 2009, it has sold more than 20&nbsp;million units and raised over $63&nbsp;million for humanitarian aid in Africa and the US.

Before the writing of "We Are the World", American entertainer and social activist [[Harry Belafonte]] had sought for some time to have a song recorded by the most famous artists in the music industry at the time. He planned to have the proceeds donated to a new organization called United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa). The non-profit foundation would then feed and relieve starving people in Africa, specifically [[Ethiopia]], where around one million people died during the country's [[1984<U+2013>1985 famine in Ethiopia|1984<U+2013>1985 famine]].<ref name="tara 341">Taraborrelli, p. 341</ref><ref name="Ethiopia Faces Famine Again, Requests Massive Food Relief">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73844842.html?dids=73844842:73844842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+14%2C+1987&author=Blaine+Harden&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Ethiopia+Faces+Famine+Again%2C+Requests+Massive+Food+Relief&pqatl=google|title=Ethiopia Faces Famine Again, Requests Massive Food Relief|last=Harden|first=Blaine|date=September 14, 1987|publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref> The idea followed [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas]]" project in the UK, which Belafonte had heard about.<ref name="A hit with a heart: 'We Are the World' buoyed by brisk sales and curiosity">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/25092058.html?dids=25092058:25092058&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+17%2C+1985&author=Jonathan+Taylor+and+Gary+Graff+Los+Angeles+Daily+News%2C+Chicago+Tribune+and+Knight-Ridder+Newspapers&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=A+HIT+WITH+A+HEART%3A+'WE+ARE+THE+WORLD'+BUOYED+BY+BRISK+SALES+AND+CURIOSITY&pqatl=google|title=A hit with a heart: 'We Are the World' buoyed by brisk sales and curiosity|last=Taylor|first=Jonathan|date=March 17, 1985|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|accessdate=October 7, 2009}}</ref>{{cref|a}} In the activist's plans, money would also be set aside to help eliminate hunger in the United States of America. Entertainment manager and fellow fundraiser [[Ken Kragen]] was contacted by Belafonte, who asked for singers [[Lionel Richie]] and [[Kenny Rogers]]<U+2014>Kragen's clients<U+2014>to participate in Belafonte's musical endeavor. Kragen and the two musicians agreed to help with Belafonte's mission, and in turn, enlisted the cooperation of [[Stevie Wonder]], to add more "name value" to their project.<ref name="tara 341"/> [[Quincy Jones]] was drafted to co-produce the song, taking time out from his work on ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]''.<ref name="tara 341"/><ref name="tara 342"/> Richie also telephoned [[Michael Jackson]], who had just released the commercially successful ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' album and had concluded [[Victory Tour|a tour]] with [[The Jacksons|his brothers]].<ref name="tara 341"/> Jackson revealed to Richie that he not only wanted to sing the song, but to participate in its writing as well.<ref name="tara 341"/><ref name="Campbell 109">Campbell, p. 109</ref> To begin with, "We Are the World" was to be written by Jackson, Richie and Wonder. As Wonder had limited time to work on the project, Jackson and Richie proceeded to write "We Are the World" themselves.<ref name="Campbell 109"/> They began work on the song's creation at Hayvenhurst, the [[Encino]] home of Jackson and [[Jackson family|his family]]. For a week, the two spent every night working on lyrics and melodies in the latter's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song which would be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an [[anthem]]. Jackson's older sister, [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]], watched the two work on the song, and later revealed that Richie only wrote a few lines for the track.<ref name="tara 342">Taraborrelli, p. 342</ref> She stated that her younger brother wrote 99&nbsp;percent of the lyrics, "but he's never felt it necessary to say that".<ref name="tara 342"/> La Toya further commented on the song's creation in an interview with the American celebrity news magazine ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''. "I'd go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them."<ref name="Campbell 109"/>

Richie had recorded two melodies for "We Are the World", which Jackson took, adding music and words to the song in the same day. Jackson stated, "I love working quickly. I went ahead without even Lionel knowing, I couldn't wait. I went in and came out the same night with the song completed<U+2014>drums, piano, strings, and words to the chorus."<ref name="Campbell 110">Campbell, p. 110</ref> Jackson then presented his [[demo (music)|demo]] to Richie and Jones, who were both shocked; they did not expect the pop star to see the structure of the song so quickly. The next meetings between Jackson and Richie were unfruitful; the pair did not produce any additional vocals and got no work done. It was not until the night of January 21, 1985, that Richie and Jackson completed the lyrics and melody of "We Are the World" within two and a half hours, one night before the song's first recording session.<ref name="Campbell 110"/>

==Recording sessions==
The first night of recording, January 22, 1985, had tight security on hand, as Richie, Jackson, Wonder and Jones started work on "We Are the World" at Kenny Rogers' Lion Share Recording Studio. The studio, on [[Beverly Boulevard]] in California, was filled with musicians, technicians, video crews, [[retinue]]s, assistants and organizers as the four musicians entered. To begin the night, a "vocal guide" of "We Are the World" was recorded by Richie and Jackson and duplicated on tape for each of the invited performers. The guide was recorded on the sixth [[take]], as Quincy Jones felt that there was too much "thought" in the previous versions.<ref name="breskin 2">Breskin, p. 2</ref>

Following their work on the vocal guide, Jackson and Jones began thinking of alternatives for the line "There's a chance we're taking, we're taking our own lives": the pair were concerned that the latter part of the line would be considered a reference to [[suicide]]. As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to "We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. "One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a ''choice'' we're making.'"<ref name="breskin 3">Breskin, p. 3</ref> At around 1:30&nbsp;am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound "sha-lum sha-lin-gay".<ref name="breskin 3"/> Jones told the group that they were not to add anything else to the tape. "If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio", he announced.<ref name="breskin 3"/>

On January 24, 1985, after a day of rest, Jones shipped Richie and Jackson's vocal guide to all of the artists who would be involved in "We Are the World"'s recording. Enclosed in the package was a letter from Jones, addressed to "My Fellow Artists":<ref name="breskin 3"/>

<blockquote>
The cassettes are numbered, and I can't express how important it is not to let this material out of your hands. Please do not make copies, and return this cassette the night of the 28th. In the years to come, when your children ask, 'What did mommy and daddy do for the war against world famine?', you can say proudly, ''this'' was your contribution.<ref name="breskin 3"/>
</blockquote>

Ken Kragen chaired a production meeting at a bungalow off [[Sunset Boulevard]] on January 25, 1985. There, Kragen and his team addressed where the song would be completed by the supergroup of musicians. He stated, "The single most damaging piece of information is where we're doing this. If that shows up anywhere, we've got a chaotic situation that could totally destroy the project. The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a [[Bob Dylan]]<U+2014>I guarantee you!<U+2014>drives up and sees a mob around that studio, he will never come in."<ref name="breskin 3"/> On the same night, Quincy Jones' associate producer and vocal arranger, [[Tom Bahler]], was given the task of matching each solo line with the right voice. Bahler stated, "It's like vocal arranging in a perfect world".<ref name="breskin 3"/> Jones disagreed, stating that the task was like "putting a watermelon in a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle".<ref name="breskin 3"/> The following evening, Lionel Richie held a "choreography" session at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.<ref name="breskin 3"/>

The final night of recording was held on January 28, 1985, at A&M Recording Studios in [[Hollywood, California]].<ref name="breskin 3"/><ref name="The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/27/arts/the-pop-life-artists-join-in-effort-for-famine-relief.html?&pagewanted=all|title=The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=February 27, 1985|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=July 11, 2009}}</ref> Michael Jackson arrived at 9&nbsp;pm, earlier than the other artists, to record his solo section and record a vocal chorus by himself.<ref name="breskin 3"/> He was subsequently joined in the recording studio by the remaining USA for Africa artists, which included [[Ray Charles]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Smokey Robinson]].

Following its release, "We Are the World" received mixed reviews from journalists, music critics and the public. American journalist [[Greil Marcus]] felt that the song sounded like a [[Pepsi]] jingle.<ref name="Garofalo 29">Garofalo, p. 29</ref> He wrote, "[...] the constant repetition of 'There's a choice we're making' conflates with Pepsi's trademarked 'The choice of a new generation' in a way that, on the part of Pepsi-contracted song writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, is certainly not intentional, and even more certainly beyond the realm of serendipity."<ref name="Garofalo 29"/> Marcus added, "In the realm of contextualization, 'We Are the World' says less about Ethiopia than it does about Pepsi<U+2014>and the true result will likely be less that certain Ethiopian individuals will live, or anyway live a bit longer than they otherwise would have, than that Pepsi will get the catch phrase of its advertising campaign sung for free by Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen, and all the rest."<ref name="Garofalo 29"/> Author Reebee Garofalo agreed, and expressed the opinion that the line "We're saving our own lives" was a "distasteful element of self-indulgence".<ref name="Garofalo 29"/> She asserted that the artists of USA for Africa were proclaiming "their own salvation for singing about an issue they will never experience on behalf of a people most of them will never encounter".<ref name="Garofalo 29"/>

In contrast, [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the phrase "There's a choice we're making, We're saving our own lives".<ref name="The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief"/> He commented that the line assumed "an extra emotional dimension when sung by people with superstar mystiques".<ref name="The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief"/> Holden expressed that the song was "an artistic triumph that transcends its official nature".<ref name="The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief"/> He noted that unlike Band Aid's "Do They Know It's Christmas", the vocals on "We Are the World" were "artfully interwoven" and emphasized the individuality of each singer.<ref name="The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief"/> Holden concluded that "We Are the World" was "a simple, eloquent ballad" and a "fully-realized pop statement that would sound outstanding even if it weren't recorded by stars".<ref name="The pop life; artists join in effort for famine relief"/>

According to music critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer [[Dave Marsh]], "We Are the World" was not widely accepted within the [[rock music]] community.<ref name="marsh 519">Marsh, p. 519</ref> The author revealed that the song was "despised" for what it was not: "a rock record, a critique of the political policies that created the famine, a way of finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the entire worldwide spectrum of post-[[Elvis Presley|Presley]] popular music".<ref name="marsh 519"/> Marsh revealed that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly.<ref name="marsh 519"/> He claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song, "We Are the World" was a large scale pop event with serious political overtones.<ref name="marsh 519"/>

"We Are the World" was recognized with several awards following its release. At the [[Grammy Awards of 1986|1986 Grammy Awards]], the song and its accompanying music video won four awards: [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]].<ref name="campbell 114 115">Campbell, pp. 114<U+2013>115</ref> The music video was awarded three honors at the 1985 [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

==Marketing and promotion==
"We Are the World" was promoted with a music video, a video cassette, and several other items made available to the public, including books, posters, shirts and buttons.<ref name="Campbell 112">Campbell, p. 112</ref><ref name="Belafonte learns answers aren't easy">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pNkSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1vsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5227,4256062&dq=we-are-the-world|title=Belafonte learns answers aren't easy|last=May|first=Clifford D.|date=June 27, 1985|publisher=''The Ledger''|accessdate=July 19, 2009}}</ref> All proceeds from the sale of official USA for Africa merchandise went directly to the famine relief fund. All of the merchandise sold well; the video cassette<U+2014>entitled ''We Are the World: The Video Event''<U+2014>documented the making of the song, and became the ninth best-selling home video of 1985.<ref name="Campbell 112"/>

The music video showed the recording of "We Are the World", and drew criticism from some. They felt that Michael Jackson was "unable to leave his ego at the door" in the video because he wore sequinned socks, a single glove and sunglasses.<ref name="Campbell 113"/> The singer claimed he had wanted to wear his signature socks so that the audience would be able to identify him; in the clip, the camera moves up his body, before resting on his face. The musician joked before filming, "People will know it's me as soon as they see the socks. Try taking footage of Bruce Springsteen's socks and see if anyone knows who they belong to."<ref name="tara 344"/> Jackson was also  criticised for filming and recording his solo piece privately, away from the other artists. The singer's supporters reasoned that Jackson was a perfectionist; recording in front of other big name artists would leave him awestruck and unable to perform at his best. His detractors suggested that Jackson liked to feel different from everybody else, and that he had wanted to emphasise the difference by erecting barriers around himself.<ref name="tara 343"/>

The song was also promoted with a special edition of the American magazine ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''. The publication had been the only media outlet permitted inside A&M Recording Studios on the night of January 28, 1985. All other press organizations were barred from reporting the events leading up to and during "We Are the World"'s recording. ''Life'' ran a cover story of the recording session in its April 1985 edition of the monthly magazine. Seven members of USA for Africa were pictured on the cover; Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Cyndi Lauper, Lionel Richie, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Willie Nelson. Inside the magazine were photographs of the "We Are the World" participants working and taking breaks.<ref name="Campbell 112"/>

On the morning of April 5, 1985<U+2014>[[Good Friday]]<U+2014>"We Are the World" received worldwide coverage. At 10.25 am, over 8000 radio stations simultaneously broadcast the song around the world. They played it to show their support for the relief of famine in Ethiopia.<ref name="Campbell 113"/> The song was also broadcast by [[Muzak]], a company which pipes background music into 110,000 stores and businesses in the US. It was the second time Muzak had played the sound of "human voice", the first being an announcement on the release of American hostages in Iran in 1981.<ref name="'We Are the World' is Muzak to some ears">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v9ITAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hAYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4665,1737587&dq=we-are-the-world|title='We Are the World' is Muzak to some ears|date=(April 5, 1985)|publisher=''The Gainesville Sun''|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> As the song was broadcast, hundreds of people sang along on the steps of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York.<ref name="Strike Up the Bandwagon We Are the World Raises Money, Spirits"/><ref name="Fifth Avenue Singalong Supports Relief Effort">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/06/arts/fifth-avenue-singalong-supports-relief-effort.html?n=Top%2FNews%2FScience%2FTopics%2FDrought|title=Fifth Avenue Singalong Supports Relief Effort|date=(April 6, 1985)|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref> The simultaneous radio broadcast of "We Are the World" was repeated again the following Good Friday.<ref name="Campbell 113"/>

"We Are the World" gained further promotion and coverage on May 25, 1986, when it was played during a major benefit event held throughout the US.<ref name="Hands">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WegLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jVkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4387,2498283&dq=we-are-the-world|title=Hands|date=(May 23, 1986)|publisher=''The Evening Independent''|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref><ref name="A 15-minute handshake for the US">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uDkRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hucDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4330,8746757&dq=we-are-the-world|title=A 15-minute handshake for the US|last=Hewett|first=Jenni|date=May 27, 1986|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> [[Hands Across America]]<U+2014>USA for Africa's follow-up project<U+2014>was an event in which millions of people formed a [[human chain]] across the US.<ref name="Hunger song profits exceed expectation">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b7ISAAAAIBAJ&sjid=y_kDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5679,1906145&dq=we-are-the-world|title=Hunger song profits exceed expectation|date=(October 9, 1986)|publisher=''[[Spokane Chronicle]]''|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> The event was held to draw attention to hunger and homelessness in the United States.<ref name="Altruistic marketing">{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1985/11/25/66688/index.htm|title=Altruistic marketing|last=Steinbreder|first=John|date=November 25, 1985|publisher=''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> "We Are the World"'s co-writer, Michael Jackson, had wanted his song to be the official theme for the event. The other board members of USA for Africa outvoted the singer, and it was instead decided that a new song would be created and released for the event, titled "Hands Across America".<ref name="campbell 114 115"/> When released, the new song did not achieve the level of success that "We Are the World" did, and the decision to use it at as the official theme for the event led to Jackson<U+2014>who co-owned the publishing rights to "We Are the World"<U+2014>resigning from the board of directors of USA for Africa.<ref name="campbell 114 115"/><ref name="Campbell 116">Campbell, p. 116</ref>

In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45 million and $47 million worth of official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced that they would not be distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that the foundation would be looking into finding a long-term solution for Africa's problems.<ref name="USA for Africa readies for first mercy mission" /> "We could go out and spend it all in one shot.

In June 1985, the first USA for Africa cargo jet carrying food, medicine and clothing departed for Ethiopia and the [[Sudan]].

==Legacy==
"We Are the World" has been recognized as a politically important song, which "effected an international focus on Africa that was simply unprecedented".<ref name="Garofalo 29"/> It has been credited with creating a climate in which musicians from around the world felt inclined to follow.<ref name="Garofalo 29"/> According to ''The New York Times''' Stephen Holden, since the release of "We Are the World", it has been noted that movement has been made within popular music to create songs that address humanitarian concerns.<ref name="Pop for Grown-Ups Gathers Momentum">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/27/arts/pop-for-grown-ups-gathers-momentum.html|title=Pop for Grown-Ups Gathers Momentum|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=December 27, 1987|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> "We Are the World" was also influential in subverting the way music and meaning were produced, showing that musically and racially diverse musicians could work together both productively and creatively.<ref name="marsh 519"/> ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' described the January 28 recording session, in which Quincy Jones brought together a multi-racial group, as being "a major moment in world music that showed we can change the world".<ref name="Black music">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wsoDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA136&dq=jackson+%22we+are+the+world%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&num=100&as_brr=3&ei=E4EmSvWKIZj2MPnR0ZUL|title=Black music|date=(November, 2005)|publisher=''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> "We Are the World", along with [[Live Aid]] and [[Farm Aid]], demonstrated that rock music had become more than entertainment, but a political and social movement.<ref name="Politics and a crossbreeding of forms were the trend">{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=et8SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mu8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5330,6088123&dq=we-are-the-world|title=Politics and a crossbreeding of forms were the trend|last=Palmer|first=Robert|date=December 26, 1985|publisher=''The Spokesman-Review''|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> Journalist Robert Palmer noted that such songs and events had the ability to reach people around the world, send them a message, and then get results.<ref name="Politics and a crossbreeding of forms were the trend" />

Since the release of "We Are the World", numerous songs have been recorded in a similar fashion, with the intent to aid famine victims throughout the world. One such example involved a supergroup of Latin musicians billed as "Hermanos del Tercer Mundo", or "Brothers of the Third World". Among the supergroup of 62&nbsp;recording artists were [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Jose Feliciano]] and [[Sergio Mendes]]. Their famine relief song was recorded in the same studio as "We Are the World". Half of the profits raised from the charity single was pledged to USA for Africa. The rest of the money was to be used for impoverished Latin American countries.<ref name="Latin stars sing for hungry">{{cite news|title=Latin stars sing for hungry|date=(April 10, 1985)|publisher=''Columbia Missourian''|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref>

The 20th anniversary of "We Are the World" was celebrated in 2005. Radio stations around the world paid homage to Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie and USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by the release of a two-disc DVD called ''We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song''.<ref name="Stations pay tribute to 'We Are the World'">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/01/28/stations_pay_tribute_to_we_are_the_world/|title=Stations pay tribute to 'We Are the World'|last=Lewis|first=Randy|date=January 28, 2005|publisher=''[[The Boston Globe]]''|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref> Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to "use it to do some more good [for the original charity]. That's all we care about accomplishing."<ref name="Stations pay tribute to 'We Are the World'" /> Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20th&nbsp;anniversary of the song. The entertainer acknowledged that "We Are the World" had "stood the test of time"; anyone old enough to remember it can still at least hum along.<ref name="'We Are the World' song celebrates 20 years">{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6870678/|title='We Are the World' song celebrates 20 years|last=Gangel|first=Jamie|date=February 5, 2005|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=July 22, 2009}}</ref>
