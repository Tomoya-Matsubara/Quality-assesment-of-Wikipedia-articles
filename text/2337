'''Mafia Raj''' ([[Hindi]]: <U+092E><U+093E><U+092B><U+093C><U+093F><U+092F><U+093E> <U+0930><U+093E><U+091C>, ''mafia regime'') refers to an economic and political situation where [[public good]]s, [[public property|property]] and funds are controlled and systematically embezzled by a criminalized nexus (or "[[mafia]]") of government officials, elected politicians, business interests and other entities (such as law-enforcement authorities, non-governmental organizations, trade unions or criminal organizations).<ref name="jotias2003">"Developmental policy of the state, globalization and prawn aquaculture, Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society v.23", Indian Anthropological Society, 2003. Snippet: ''... Mafia Raj is the rule of a group of powerful people (usually outsiders from among politicians and their relatives, top bureaucrats and shrimp merchants), their musclemen and local encroachers (local non-fisher-folk and also some influential local fisher-folk financed by outsiders who operate in connivance with revenue and police officials)...''</ref><ref name="loksabha1997">Lok Sabha, "Lok Sabha Debates, ser.11 Jul 29 1997 v.15 no.5", Lok Sabha Secretariat, Lok Sabha (House of the People), Parliament of India, 1997. Snippet: ''... This has also placed the mafia raj in politics and in every sphere of social life in Bihar ...''</ref> The phenomenon of Mafia Raj is highly prevalent in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] as well, countries which share a similar culture to that of India.

The term is used primarily in [[India]], and can refer to cities, states, government departments, public sector businesses or entire sectors of the economy that are subject to these conditions. Due to the ability of these mafias to operate their illegal activities in a sustained fashion, sometimes openly and with the use of violent intimidation, terms like '''Goonda Raj''' (''rule of the goons''), '''Jungle Raj''' (''law of the jungle'') and Anarchy are used to refer to the same phenomenon.<ref name="singh2003">Mahendra Prasad Singh and Rekha Saxena, "India at the Polls: Parliamentary Elections in the Federal Phase", Orient Blackswan, 2003, ISBN 8125023283. Snippet: ''... The manifesto of the Bahujan Samaj Party sought to highlight four major objectives ... annihilation of the 'Goonda-Mafia raj' and anarchic forces ...''</ref>

In the Indian and [[Pakistan]]i media, the mafias are usually mentioned by the name of the economic sector in which they are involved. Terms such as ''coal mafia'', ''timber mafia'' (sometimes, ''forest mafia''), ''contractor mafia'' (sometimes, ''road construction mafia'' or ''road contract mafia'') and ''land mafia'' are commonly used.

==Coal Mafia==
[[Image:182619562 00d6f703b6 b.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Indian coal mine. The [[Dhanbad]] mine complex is allegedly dominated by a coal mafia.]]
The state-owned coal mines of [[Bihar]] (now [[Jharkhand]] after the division of Bihar state) were among the first areas in India to see the emergence of a sophisticated mafia, beginning with the mining town of [[Dhanbad]].<ref name="bharti1989">Indu Bharti, "Usurpation of the State: Coal Mafia in Bihar", Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 24, No. 42, pg. 2353. Oct. 21, 1989.</ref> It is alleged that the coal industry's trade union leadership forms the upper echelon of this particular arrangement, and employs caste allegiances to maintain its power.<ref name="rao1983">S. Venugopala Rao, "Crime in Our Society: A Political Perspective", Vikas Publishing House, 1983, ISBN 0706912098. Snippet: ''... Using the vast money, muscle and caste power, trade union leaders have built up a Mafia-like empire which totally controls the life and economy of Dhanbad ... workers who constitute about 40 percent of Dhanbad districts population are mainly tribals, adivasis, Harijans and backward castes, while the trade union musclemen are mostly Rajputs of Bhojpur and Rohtas districts ...''</ref> Pilferage and sale of coal on the black market, inflated or fictitious supply expenses, falsified worker contracts and the expropriation and leasing-out of government land have allegedly become routine.<ref name="mathur1991">Ajeet N.

According to many workers, it is not possible for genuine trade unionism to flourish in Dhanbad because of illicit trading and profiteering in the garb of trade unionism and the protective umbrella such an institution holds out ...''</ref> A parallel economy has also developed with a significant fraction of the local population employed by the mafia in manually transporting the stolen coal for long distances over unpaved roads to illegal mafia warehouses and points of sale.<ref name=frontline2005>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2205/stories/20050311001703700.htm |title= Coal theft and vote |publisher=Frontline Magazine, The Hindu Newspaper Group |date=Feb 26 - Mar 11, 2005 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref>

The coal mafia has had a negative effect on Indian industry, with coal supplies and quality varying erratically. Higher quality coal is sometimes selectively diverted, and missing coal replaced with stones and boulders in railway cargo wagons. Once, even a human corpse has been discovered in a sealed coal wagon.<ref name="mittal1994">D. K. Mittal, "Coal Industry", Anmol Publications Private Limited, 1994, ISBN 8170418631. Snippet: ''...

==Timber Mafias==
[[Image:Himachal Pradesh hills.jpg|thumb|right|250px|India's Himalayan and other forests are vulnerable to timber mafias.]]
Protected forest areas in several parts of India, such as [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and Jharkhand, are vulnerable to illegal logging by timber mafias that have coopted or intimidated forestry officials, local politicians, businesses and citizenry.<ref name="colchester1999">Marcus Colchester and Christian Erni, "Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in South and Southeast Asia: From Principles to Practice", IWGIA, 1999, ISBN 8790730186.

As with coal, there have also been incidents of substitution of low-grade wood for high-quality timber when the procurement of wood is, in fact, authorized for government use. In an incident in 2005, officials determined that high-quality [[deodar]] wood meant for military and railway use had been substituted with lower-quality [[Chir Pine|chir]] wood in Jammu and Kashmir state, and the higher quality wood was intercepted in the process of being smuggled across the state border into [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]].<ref name="tribune2005">{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050802/j&k.htm#1 |title=After water for petrol, Army gets <U+2018>substandard<U+2019> wood  |publisher=The Tribune, Chandigarh |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2008-10-29}}</ref>

==Contractor Mafias==
[[Image:Delhi-Gurgaon_Airport_Expressway,_2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public works, such as road construction, are sometimes dominated by contractor mafias.]]
Many state-funded construction activities in India, such as road building, are dominated by construction mafias, which are groupings of corrupt public works officials, materials suppliers, politicians and construction contractors.<ref name="indiatoday2006">{{cite web|url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20061016/state-up.html |title=Mulayam Hits Mafia Hard |publisher=India Today |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} Snippet: ''...

In a widely covered case, [[Satyendra Dubey]], a project director with the National Highways Authority of India, was murdered in 2003, allegedly because he had written a letter exposing deep-seated contractor mafia involvement in the construction of a section of the prestigious [[Golden Quadrilateral]] project to the Prime Minister's office.<ref name="rediff2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.co.in/news/2006/nov/27dubey.htm |title=Satyendra Dubey: A forgotten hero? |publisher=Rediff |date=2006-11-27 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} Snippet: ''...

Attempts have been made to reduce mafia influence by making construction [[tendering]] processes more transparent, sometimes by attempting to move them online, so that a complete [[audit trail]] of bids and activity is maintained. Construction mafias are alleged to have used their political influence decisively to frustrate many such attempts, for example in the public works for which the [[Municipal Corporation of Delhi]] is responsible.<ref name="hindu2005-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/01/03/stories/2005010309240400.htm |title=Tender mafia's domination in MCD continues  |publisher=The Hindu |date=2005-01-03 |accessdate=2008-10-30}} Snippet: ''...

==Land Mafias==
[[Image:WhiteTiger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A local land mafia reportedly attempted to seize land planned to be used by the Central Zoo Authority as the site for India's first night safari.]]
In cities and villages throughout India, mafias consisting of municipal and other government officials, elected politicians, judicial officers, real estate developers and law enforcement officials, acquire, develop and sell land in illegal ways for profit.<ref name="gupta2008">K.R.

Computerization of records relating to the classification of tracts and land ownership is a key tool in countering the illegal activities of land mafias, since it creates transparency on all information relating to a given parcel of land. This approach has been effective in [[Bangalore]],<ref name="vittal2007">N. Vittal, "Roots of Effective Governance", Icfai University Press, 2007, ISBN 8131411567. Snippet: ''... transparency ... was introduced in allotment of sites. The element of discretion involved in this process was removed. The whole system was totally computerized.

Ten per cent. ...''</ref> Focused vigilance in specific areas by government agencies has also acted as a deterrent to land mafia activities.
