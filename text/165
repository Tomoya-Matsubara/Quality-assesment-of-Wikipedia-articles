{{nihongo|'''''Psycho-Pass'''''|<U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30B3><U+30D1><U+30B9>|Saiko Pasu}} is a Japanese [[anime]] television series that was produced by [[Production I.G]], directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani and written by [[Gen Urobuchi]]. The series was aired on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[Noitamina]] programming block between October 2012 and March 2013. The story takes place in a [[dystopia]] in which it is possible using a device called a Dominator to scan the Psycho-Pass of every citizen, to instantaneously measure their mental state, personality, and the probability that she or he will commit crimes. It follows [[Akane Tsunemori]] and other members of Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division, and the crimes they investigate.

The series has been licensed by [[Funimation]] in North America. A second season will begin airing in October 2014 followed by an animated film to be released in the first quarter of 2015. A [[manga]] adaptation has been in serialization in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Jump Square]]'' magazine and several novels, including an adaptation and prequels to the original story, have been published. An episodic video game adaptation called ''Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass'' was developed by [[Nitroplus]] Staffers in collaboration with Production I.G. New novels and another manga are due to be serialized in 2014.

''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s achievements. The series was inspired by several live-action films. Chief director Katsuyuki Motohiro aimed to explore psychological themes in society's youth using dystopian storylines. Several rules were used to focus on making the dystopia that the characters live in.

Critical reception of the series has been mostly positive; the setting of the series and the cases which develop the protagonists were praised. Special mention was given to the villain and philosophy discussed in the series. However, the series' gruesome imagery and aspects of the setting were criticized.

==Plot==

===Setting ===
''Psycho-Pass'' is set in 2113. The {{nihongo|Sibyl System|<U+30B7><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30E9><U+30B7><U+30B9><U+30C6><U+30E0>|Shibyura Shisutemu}} is actively measuring the populace's mental states, personalities, and the probability that individuals will commit crimes, using a "cymatic scan" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a {{nihongo|Psycho-Pass|<U+30B5><U+30A4><U+30B3><U+30D1><U+30B9>|Saikopasu}}. When the probability of a person engaging in crimes measured by the {{nihongo|Crime Coefficient|<U+72AF><U+7F6A><U+4FC2><U+6570>|Hanzaikeis<U+016B>}} index exceeds a certain level in an individual, he or she is pursued, apprehended, and killed if necessary.

===Story===
{{see also|List of Psycho-Pass characters}}
The plot focuses on [[Akane Tsunemori]], a new Inspector of Unit One{{mdash}}a police unit from the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. Tsunemori hunts criminals alongside a special team of so-called latent criminals called Enforcers. Inspectors and Enforcers use large handguns called "Dominators"{{mdash}}special weapons designed to fire only at those with a higher-than-acceptable Crime Coefficient. Akane is ashamed of shooting the Enforcer [[Shinya Kogami]] during her first mission to protect a latent criminal. Kogami thanks her for stopping him from becoming a murderer, which persuades Akane to stay. During Akane's first investigations, the group learns about the existence of Shogo Makishima, a mastermind who is responsible for multiple crimes. Being {{nihongo|Criminally Asymptomatic|<U+514D><U+7F6A><U+4F53><U+8CEA>|Menzai Taishitsu}}, Makishima's criminal psychology yields a low Crime Coefficient, making him safe from the Dominator.

The Enforcers and Inspectors start hunting Makishima, who aims to destroy the society created by the Sibyl System. To do this he causes riots in the city to draw the police away from the Health and Welfare Ministry's Nona Tower facility, where Sibyl is located. Akane and Kogami stop Makishima's forces while Enforcer Sh<U+016B>sei Kagari follows one of Makishima's allies to the tower where Bureau Chief Joshu Kasei kills Makishima's ally and Kagari to keep the true form of Sibyl a secret. Kasei tells Makishima that Sibyl is a hivemind of similarly asymptomatic individuals and wishes him to join the system but Makishima escapes. Realizing the truth behind Makishima's escape, Kogami leaves the group to kill him. Akane is later directly contacted by the Sibyl system, which orders her to capture Makishima alive. She agreeing to do this if they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Learning that Makishima plans to execute [[bioterrorism]] to weaken Japan's economy and bring the system down, the Criminal Investigation Division searches for both Makishima and Kogami. However, despite Akane's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima and the latter's erstwhile comrades never see him again.

==Production==
The series was directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani, written by Gen Urobuchi and features character designs by manga artist Akira Amano. It stars [[Kana Hanazawa]] as Akane Tsunemori, [[Tomokazu Seki]] as Shinya Kogami and [[Takahiro Sakurai]] as Shogo Makishima.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-03-30/psycho-pass-anime-series-coming-to-noitamina-in-october|title=Psycho-pass Anime Series Coming to Noitamina in October|date=March 30, 2012|accessdate=April 1, 2012|publisher=Anime News Network}}</ref> ''Psycho-Pass'' originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and ''[[Patlabor]]''; the company hired Katsuyuki Motohiro{{mdash}}who became the series' chief director{{mdash}}and veteran I.G. animator Naoyoshi Shiotani to supervise direction.<ref name="psychopassreviewinter">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass-season-one/blu-ray-complete-collection-premium-edition|title=Psycho-Pass Season One Blu-Ray - Complete Collection Premium Edition|date=April 29, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014|publisher=Anime News Network}}</ref>

Motohiro wanted to return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were surprised with [[Gen Urobuchi]]'s contribution to the anime series ''[[Puella Magi Madoka Magica]]'', which was said to exceed the series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''. Motohiro was fascinated by ''Madoka Magica''; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together.<ref name="interviewmothiro">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2012-10-11/psycho-pass-chief-director/word-moe-is-banned-among-staff|title=Psycho-Pass Chief Director: Word 'Moe' Is Banned Among Staff|date=October 11, 2012|accessdate= February 23, 2013|publisher=Anime News Network}}</ref> Early in the making of the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything that could not be adapted into a live-action film.<ref name="jentonline">{{cite web |url=http://j-entonline.com/interviews-and-articles/media-qa-psycho-pass/|title=Media Q&A with Executive Director Katsuyuki Motohiro, Director Naoyoshi Shiotani and Producer Joji Wada (of "PSYCHO-PASS") by Dennis A.

Before work on ''Psycho-Pass'' started, Shiotani was busy working on the film ''[[Blood-C|Blood-C: The Last Dark]]''. As soon as his work with the film ended, Shiotani focused on the series' quality. After episode 16, which proved to be the most challenging and popular of the series, the team found themselves "out of stamina". The next two episodes were made by an outside team, which is reflected in several problems with the animation.<ref name="jentonline"/> In response to this, the producer of the episode said that while he expected problems, he worked to make it the best he could. Shiotani also apologized for the episode's quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/02/21/urobuchi-supports-psycho-pass-director-on-twitter-spoiler-alert|title=Urobuchi Supports "PSYCHO-PASS" Director On Twitter SPOILER ALERT |publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 21, 2013|date=October 5, 2012|author=Green, Scott}}</ref> The original team Continue working from episode 19 until the finale; they decided to remake episodes 17 and 18 for their retail release.<ref name="jentonline"/>

In March 2013, Shiotani stated there could be a second season if the show received enough support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-03-30/funimation-confirms-psycho-pass-home-video-release|title=Funimation Confirms Psycho Pass home video release|publisher=Anime News Network|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=January 7, 2014}}</ref> Once development of the second season started, Shiotani said the new episodes are more difficult to make than those in the first season. He said, "it's more about the show's inflexibility" because the staff have to maintain consistency.<ref name="secondseasonmusic"/>  For the season [[Tow Ubukata]] replaced Urobuchi as main writer.<ref name="ubukata">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-06-23/psycho-pass-2-scripts-overseen-by-fafner-tow-ubukata/.75843|title=Psycho-Pass 2's Scripts Overseen by Fafner's Tow Ubukata

===Design===
[[File:PsychoPassKogamisketch.jpg|thumb|right|Sketches of Shinya Kogami by Akira Amano. The staff avoided using colors that would stand out.]]
When hearing the comments from [[Atsuko Ishizuka]], director of  ''[[The Pet Girl of Sakurasou]]'', about the way the characters were designed first, Shiotani realized it was the opposite for his team, who had to create the setting first and then the characters because they "are almost being played by the world". As a result, the characters were designed by [[manga artist]] [[Akira Amano]] to balance them with the dark atmosphere by having them "palatable and very relate-able". The staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out.<ref name="panel"/> Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character, who would question the setting from the audience's point of view and as the heroine who would come between Shinya Kogami and Shogo Makishima. Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives.<ref name="jentonline"/>

Motohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. He acknowledges that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychologically brutality.<ref name="interviewmothiro"/> He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an "artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it".<ref name="jentonline"/> About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi about the amount of violence, "just let us deal with it".<ref name="jentonline"/> Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera, but whenever a protagonist was involved the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went "overboard."<ref name="jentonline"/>

Motohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends. The use of ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' (slang) was prohibited within the staff because they appreciated dramas like ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' and ''Patlabor'' that focus on conflicts between male characters. As the series was "anti-moe"; the team decided to avoid having the main characters Akane remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the ''[[shonen ai]]'' genre fans.<ref name="panel"/> Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believes the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans.<ref name="panel"/> The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships.<ref name="jentonline"/>

===Influences===
''Psycho-Pass'' was inspired by several Western films, most notably ''[[L.A. Confidential]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2013-07-23/interview-george-wada-producer-of-attack-on-titan|title=Interview: George Wada, Producer of Attack on Titan|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=July 23, 2013|publisher=Anime News Network}}</ref> Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences, including ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', ''[[Gattaca]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' and ''[[Blade Runner]]''; the latter shared several similarities with the anime series.<ref name="panel">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/sakura-con/5|title= Directors's Panel with Katsuyuki Motohiro, Naoyoshi Shiotani, and Atsuko Ishizuka|date=March 30, 2013|accessdate=December 30, 2013|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref> Before the making of the series, Urobuchi insisted on using a [[Philip K. Dick]]-inspired, dystopian narrative.<ref name="psychopassreviewinter"/> The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched ''[[Lupin III]]'' during his childhood because he thought about adding "today's youth trauma" to the series.<ref name="interviewmothiro"/> The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked.<ref name="panel"/> Other voice actors have been credited in the making of the series because of the ways they added traits to the characters.<ref name="interviewmothiro"/>

===Music===
The staff had problems composing an opening theme for the series until someone provided some music by [[Ling Tosite Sigure]], who was engaged to compose the opening theme. [[Egoist]], who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with ''[[Guilty Crown]]''. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending.<ref name="secondseasonmusic">{{cite web|url=http://otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Noitamina-Interviews-PsychoPass-Director-5650.aspx|title=Noitamina Interviews Psycho-Pass Director|publisher=Otaku USA|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=May 9, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6PRvypoid|archivedate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode. When there were concerns from the producers of the songs, Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them.<ref name="jentonline"/>

Two ''Psycho-Pass'' CDs were included in the second and fifth Japanese home media release of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://psycho-pass.com/bd-dvd/#v2|title=Blu-ray & DVD Series Volume 2|work=Psycho Pass|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://psycho-pass.com/bd-dvd/#v5|title=Blu-ray & DVD Series Volume 5|work=Psycho Pass|language=Japanese|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref> The ''Psycho Pass'' original soundtrack was released by Sony Music Entertainment on May 29, 2013.

==Reception==
Fuji TV producer Akitoshi Mori said ''Psycho-Pass'' was the first work under his control. Early screenings of the series at the Noitamina Shop & Caf<U+00E9> attracted few viewers, which bothered Mori. However, as the series contimued, the quantity of viewers increased. By the final episode, over 1,000 people had queued to watch the finale even thought the venue could only accommodate seventy people. This made Mori happy because he realized how many fans were following and supporting the show; he wanted  to see a bigger audience at future screenings.<ref name="secondseasonannounced"/> DVDs and Blu-ray discs of the series achieved good sales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-25/japan-animation-dvd-ranking-june-17-23 |publisher=Anime News Network |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 29, 2014|title= Japan's Animation DVD Ranking, June 17-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-06-25/japan-animation-blu-ray-disc-ranking-june-17-23 |publisher=Anime News Network |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 29, 2014|title=  Japan's Animation Blu-ray Disc Ranking, June 17-23}}</ref> In April 2014, the series was nominated for the [[Seiun Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/04/28-1/gargantia-psycho-pass-and-girls-und-panzer-nominated-for-seiun-sci-fi-award|publisher=Crunchyroll|date=April 28, 2014 |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |title="Gargantia," "Psycho-Pass" and "Girls und Panzer" Nominated for Seiun Sci-Fi Award}}</ref> In the ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype]]'' anime awards from 2013, it was voted as fourth best title of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-13/attack-on-titan-wins-top-prizes-in-newtype-anime-awards|title=Attack on Titan Wins Top Prizes in Newtype Anime Awards|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref>

The series was well received by publications for anime, manga and other media. Rebecca Silverman from [[Anime News Network]] praised the show for its "high level of interest" in depicting its dystopian world. However, she said that its violent scenes were so gruesome they might scare viewers.<ref name="psychostream"/><ref name="annsecondreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-12|title=Psycho-Pass episodes 12 - 22 Streaming|date=|publisher=Anime News Network|accessdate= December 30, 2013}}</ref> [[Kotaku]]'s Richard Eisenbeis called it a "compelling cyberpunk mystery", praising the society depicted and the series of murders orchestrated by Shogo Makishima. However, he criticized the use of advanced technology and compared it with other science fiction films despite saying that it handled the themes better whereas Makishima's immunity to it was left unexplained.<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|title=Psycho Pass is a Compelling Cyberpunk Mystery (And It<U+2019>s Only Half Done)|url=http://kotaku.com/5973624/psycho-pass-is-a-compelling-cyberpunk-mystery-and-its-only-half-done|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|accessdate=February 20, 2013|date=January 8, 2013}}</ref> [[DVD Talk]] gave high praise to Makishima because his achievements across the story and his personality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/63184/psycho-pass-season-1-part-1/|title=PPsycho-Pass: Part One (Blu-ray) |publisher=DVDTalk|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Certain episodes have been referred as "filler" because they are used as a build-up to the climatic ones.<ref name = "psychostream"/><ref name="fifteen">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2013/02/07/psycho-pass-episode-15-anime-review/|title=Psycho-Pass Episode #15 Anime Review |publisher=The Fandom Post|accessdate=January 7, 2013|date=October 16, 2012}}</ref>

During the streaming of the series, Silverman criticized the animation because of the low lighting levels that might make it hard to understand.<ref name="psychostream"/><ref name="annsecondreview"/> Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology.

===Themes===
As some critics have noted, ''Psycho-Pass'' explores societal and psychological themes, such as the price of living without stress. Since those who think of actions that might cause stress to others are quickly punished by the Sibyl System, the concept of punishing someone because they have the potential to do something considered wrong is explored. Questioning whether punishing someone for having the potential to do what society considers inappropriate is explored in the first episode, in which a woman is raped and because of her trauma, her Psycho-Pass is raised and the police prepare to kill her until she is saved by Akane. According to Anime News Network, "We are all capable of doing bad things at times{{mdash}}should we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".<ref name = "psychostream">{{cite web|publisher=Anime News Network|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/psycho-pass/episodes-1|title=Review: Psycho-Pass Episodes 1 - 11 Streaming|date=|accessdate= April 3, 2013}}</ref>

Emotional repression is also explored in ''Psycho-Pass''. The identification of latent criminals is partially based around the avoidance of emotions that society judges to be negative, such as sadness or anger. To avoid being identified as a latent criminal, one must not feel these emotions heavily outside, where their Psycho-Pass can be scanned. Kotaku states, "because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they control<U+2014>because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves."<ref name="kotaku"/> Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theatre create a "nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes".<ref name="psychostream"/>
