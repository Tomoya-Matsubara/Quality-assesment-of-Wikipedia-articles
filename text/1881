'''''From Bakunin to Lacan: Anti-Authoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power''''' is a  book on [[political philosophy]] by [[Saul Newman]], published in 2001. It investigates the [[essentialism|essentialist]] characteristics  of [[anarchist theory]], which holds that government and hierarchy are undesirable forms of social organisation. Newman seeks to move beyond the limitations these characteristics impose on classical anarchism by using concepts from [[post-structuralist]] thought. 

By applying post-structuralist theory to anarchism, Newman presents an account of [[post-anarchism]]. His post-anarchism is more substantive than that of earlier thinkers, and has influenced later approaches to the philosophy. Released in a climate of an anarchist movement hostile to [[postmodern philosophy]], ''From Bakunin to Lacan'' was criticised for its poor understanding of and engagement with [[Anarchist_schools_of_thought#Contemporary_developments|contemporary anarchism]].

== Background ==
The book was released in the context of the dispute in the newly resurgent anarchist movement between critics of [[civilisation]]  (primarily [[anarcho-primitivists]] exemplified by [[John Zerzan]]) and its supporters (notably [[Murray Bookchin]]). Although sharply disagreeing on the merits of civilisation, technology and language, both Zerzan and Bookchin derided [[postmodernism]] as disempowering the individual and  reinforcing  the existing order.<ref name=cohn>{{citation

}}</ref> Another significant factor in the intellectual climate of the book's release was the rediscovery in the 1990s of [[anarchist theory]] within academia.<ref name=cohn/>

Although foundational work had been done on the philosophy of [[postanarchism]] by radical theorists such as [[Andrew Koch]] and [[Todd May]], ''From Bakunin to Lacan'' introduced a slightly different and more substantive formulation of the theory.<ref name=adams>{{cite journal|url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=04/01/03/4169045 |title=Postanarchism in a Bombshell|first=Jason |last=Adams |journal=Aporia |issue=3 |accessdate=December 30, 3008}}</ref>

== Content ==
Philosophy professor Todd May asserts that the overall purpose of the book is to "to offer a critique of the way power, and specifically political power, is commonly conceived".<ref>{{cite journal|ISSN=1092-311X |doi=10.1353/tae.2002.0006 |authorlink=Todd May |last=May |first=Todd |title=Lacanian Anarchism and the Left |journal=[[Theory & Event]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=2002 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]]}}</ref> Newman persistently questions how anarchism can refrain from reproducing the forms of oppression that it strives to overcome.<ref name=glavin/>

Newman incorporates concepts from [[post-structuralist]] thought such as [[post-humanism]] and anti-[[essentialism]] into classical [[anarchism]].<ref name=adams/> Unlike May, whose [[post-anarchism]] is a combination of the two, Newman attempts to move beyond both anarchism and post-structuralism.<ref name=sasha/> He proposes that "by using the poststructuralist critique one can theorize the possibility of political resistance without essentialist guarantees: a politics of postanarchism <U+2026> by incorporating the moral principles of anarchism with the postructuralist critique of essentialism, it may be possible to arrive at an ethically workable, politically valid, and genuinely democratic notion of resistance to domination".<ref>{{cite book | last = Newman | first = Saul | title = From Bakunin to Lacan | publisher = Lexington Books | location = Lexington | year = 2001 | isbn = 0739102400 |page=158}}</ref>

The book uses the work of French philosophers [[Michel Foucault]], [[Deleuze and Guattari]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] as well as classical anarchist thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]], recognizing "proto-poststructuralist" [[Max Stirner]] as an important forerunner of postanarchist thought.<ref name=adams/> Newman focuses particularly on the work of Deleuze, Derrida and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]].<ref name=glavin>{{cite journal|journal=[[The New Formulation: An Anti-authoritarian Review of Books]] |volume=2|issue=2 |month=Winter/Spring |year=2004 |title=Power, Subjectivity, Resistance: Three Works on Postmodern Anarchism |first=Michael |last=Glavin |url=http://www.newformulation.org/4glavin.htm}}</ref>

==Reception==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Aimed at an academic rather than anarchist audience, the book was criticised in ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'' #57 for its unsophisticated, cursory understanding of and engagement with anarchist theory.<ref name=sasha>{{cite journal|url=http://www.geocities.com/kk_abacus/other/postanarchism.html |title=Review: From Bakunin to Lacan: Post-anarchism or simply post-revolution?|journal=[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] |issue=57 |month=Spring/Summer |year=2004|author=sasha k}}</ref> While praising that section of the book on post-structuralist philosophers, reviewer sasha k claimed that "Newman uses Kropotkin and Bakunin as his stand-ins for anarchism in general, and, in turn, only a few quotes from each to make his case".<ref name=sasha/> She questioned whether Newman's attribution of an essentialist conception of [[human nature]] to modern anarchists was accurate, concluding that had the book taken "a less one-dimensional view of anarchism", it would have to give up "most of what makes postanarchism post-anarchism.<ref name=sasha/> 

''New Formulation'' reviewer Michael Glavin cited Newman's ignorance of the initiative of anarchists to decentralize power and of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions, federations and [[affinity groups]] as evidence that he failed to understand power and wrongly conflated it with domination.<Ref name=glavin/>

Since the publication of ''From Bakunin to Lacan'' in 2001, there have been several attempts to develop an account of postanarchism that, while retaining many of Newman's specific conceptions of the anarchistic qualities of radical post-structuralist thought, would take postanarchist theory beyond academic discourse and into broader and more diverse environments, as the originator of postanarchism, [[Hakim Bey]], had intended.<ref name=adams/>
