The '''[[Beechcraft]] XA-38 Grizzly''' was a [[United States]] ground attack aircraft, fitted with a forward-firing 75&nbsp;mm [[cannon]] to attack heavily armored targets.  The first prototype flew on 7 May 1944 but after testing it became obvious it would not be ready for the projected [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]], and furthermore it used [[Radial engine|engines]] required by the [[B-29 Superfortress]] <U+2014> which had priority - and so it was canceled after two prototypes had been completed.

==Design and development==
The [[United States Army Air Forces]] awarded the Beech Aircraft Corporation a contract in December 1942 for two prototypes for their Model 28 "Destroyer". The requirement was for a powerful ground attack aircraft to replace the [[Douglas Aircraft Corporation|Douglas]] [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]], with the ability to hit "hardened" targets like [[tank]]s and [[bunker]]s. This capability was achieved through a 75&nbsp;mm cannon with 20 rounds, mounted in a fixed position on the nose as well as two .50 cal (12.7 mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s firing forward. Defensive armament consisted of remotely-controlled ventral and dorsal turrets, each armed with twin .50 cal (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns. There were to be two crew members, a pilot and an observer/gunner in the rear cabin, using periscope sights to aim the guns.

==Testing==
On 7 May 1944, Beech [[test pilot]] Vern Carstens flew the XA-38 on its maiden flight from the company's [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] airfield. The aircraft proved satisfactory in all respects and better than expected in some, including top speed. 

During testing, the XA-38 prototypes were flown by U.S. Army pilots and serviced by military personnel, proving to be reliable and establishing a high level of serviceability.<ref>Trimble 1983, p. 24.</ref> 

The armament proved especially effective and had it not been for wartime priorities shifting in 1944, the aircraft would most likely have been ordered in quantity{{cn|date=January 2012}}, although the B-29 had priority for the [[Wright R-3350]] engines. Instead, one prototype was scrapped and the other, intended for the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force|USAF Museum]], had an unknown fate.
