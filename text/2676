'''Jean Ren<U+00E9> Lacoste''' ({{IPA-fr|<U+0292><U+0251><U+0303>  <U+0281><U+0259>ne la<U+02C8>k<U+0254>st}}; 2 July 1904 - 12 October 1996) was a French [[tennis]] player and businessman. He was nicknamed "the Crocodile" by fans because of his tenacity on the court; he is also known worldwide as the creator of the [[Lacoste]] [[polo shirt|tennis shirt]], which he introduced in 1929.

Lacoste was one of [[The Four Musketeers (tennis)|The Four Musketeers]] with [[Jean Borotra]], [[Jacques Brugnon]], and [[Henri Cochet]], French tennis stars who dominated the game in the 1920s and early 1930s.  He won seven [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles titles at the French, American, and British championships and was an eminent baseline player and tactician of the pre-war period. As member of the French [[Davis Cup]] team he won the Davis Cup in [[1927 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1927]] and [[1928 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1928]]. Lacoste was the [[World number one male tennis player rankings|World No. 1]] player for both 1926 and 1927.<ref name=collins>{{cite book|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|pages=598, 599|author=Bud Collins|edition=2nd}}</ref>

==Tennis career==
[[File:Rene Lacoste 1922.jpg|thumb|Lacoste in 1922]]
Lacoste started playing tennis at age 15 when he accompanied his father on a trip to England.<ref name=collins/><ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|author1=Robin Finn|title=Rene Lacoste Dies at 92; Gave Fashion the Alligator|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/14/sports/rene-lacoste-dies-at-92-gave-fashion-the-alligator.html|work=The New York Times|date=14 October 1996}}</ref>

Lacoste's first participation in a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament was the [[1922 Wimbledon Championships]] in which he lost in the first round to [[Pat O'Hara Wood]]. The following year, 1923, he reached the fourth round at Wimbledon to be narrowly defeated by [[Cecil Campbell (tennis)|Cecil Campbell]] and competed for the first time in the [[1923 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|U.S. Championships]].

His breakthrough came in was 1925 when he won the singles title at the [[1925 French Championships (tennis)|French Championships]] and at [[1925 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], in both cases after a victory in the final against compatriot [[Jean Borotra]]. The following year, 1926, Lacoste lost his French title after a straight-sets defeat in the final to [[Henri Cochet]] and did not compete at Wimbledon but in September he won the [[1926 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|U.S. National Championships]] title against Borotra. He was ranked No.1 for 1926 by [[A. Wallis Myers]], tennis correspondent of [[The Daily Telegraph]].

In 1927 Lacoste was part of the [[France Davis Cup team|French team]] that captured the [[Davis Cup]] from the [[United States Davis Cup team|United States]], ending the latter's 6-year title run. The final was played at the [[Germantown Cricket Club]] in [[Philadelphia]] and Lacoste won both his singles matches against [[Bill Johnston (tennis player)|Bill Johnston]] and [[Bill Tilden]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Davis Cup <U+2013> 1927 Results|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=10003586|publisher=ITF|accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=David J.

At the [[1927 French Championships (tennis)|French Championships]] he was victorious in five sets while at the [[1927 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|U.S. National Championships]] he defended his title and denied Tilden his seventh U.S. title by winning in straight sets, although he survived setpoints in the first and third set and was down a break in the second.<ref name=robertson/> At Wimbledon Lacoste lost a five-set semifinal to Borotra.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article94414225 |title=Borotra beats Lacoste. |newspaper=[[Kalgoorlie Miner |Kalgoorlie Miner (WA : 1895 - 1950)]] |location=WA |date=2 July 1927 |accessdate=1 April 2015 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> For the second successive year he was ranked No.1.

In 1928 Lacoste lost his French title after a four-set loss in the final against Cochet. He took revenge by beating Cochet in the final of the the [[1928 Wimbledon Championships <U+2013> Men's Singles|Wimbledon Championships]] after having defeated Tilden in a five-set semifinal. The Challenge Round of the [[1928 International Lawn Tennis Challenge|1928 Davis Cup]] against the United States was played at the [[Stade Roland Garros]] in Paris on 27<U+2013>29 July. The stadium was specifically constructed to host France's first defense of the Davis Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Stadium|url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/rg_year_round/201408271409194686687.html|website=www.rolandgarros.com|publisher=[[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration fran<U+00E7>aise de tennis]] (FFT)}}</ref> Lacoste lost the first rubber in a five-set match to Tilden but France won the remaining rubbers to defeat the challengers 4<U+2013>1 and retain the cup. Lacoste did not participate in the [[1928 U.S. National Championships (tennis)|1928 U.S. Championships]].

Between 1923 and 1928 Lacoste played 51 Davis Cup matches for France in 26 ties and compiled a record of 32<U+2013>8 in singles and 8<U+2013>3 in doubles.

The only major championship he played in 1929 was the [[1929 French Championships (tennis)|French]] and he won his seventh, and last, Grand Slam singles title in a tight five-set final against [[Jean Borotra]].<ref name=chictribune/> Failing health, including [[respiratory disease]], led to his withdrawal from competitive tennis in 1929 although he would make a brief comeback at the [[1932 French Championships (tennis)|1932 French Championships]] where he defeated reigning Wimbledon champion [[Sidney Wood]] in the third round but lost in the fourth to [[Harry Lee (tennis)|Harry Lee]].<ref name=cnn>{{cite web|author1=Tom Sweetman|title=Rene Lacoste: The lasting legacy of 'Le Crocodile'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/11/sport/tennis/rene-lacoste-davis-cup-tennis/|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=davidson>{{cite book|last1=Davidson|first1=Owen|title=Lawn Tennis <U+2013> The Great Ones|date=1970|publisher=Pelham Books|location=London|isbn=9780720703801|pages=34<U+2013>38|oclc=99470}}</ref> He was the non-playing captain of the French [[Davis Cup]] team in 1932 and 1933.

The Four Musketeers were inducted simultaneously into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]], in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in 1976. In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer (tennis player)|Jack Kramer]], the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, included Lacoste in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.{{efn|name=kramer|Writing in 1979, Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game).  The next four best were, chronologically, [[Bill Tilden]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Bobby Riggs]], and [[Pancho Gonzales]].  After these six came the "second echelon" of [[Rod Laver]], [[Lew Hoad]], [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Gottfried von Cramm]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis player)|Jack Crawford]], [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Tony Trabert]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Stan Smith]], [[Bj<U+00F6>rn Borg]], and [[Jimmy Connors]].  He felt unable to rank [[Henri Cochet]] and Ren<U+00E9> Lacoste accurately but felt they were among the very best.}}

In 1928 Lacoste authored a book titled '' 'Lacoste on Tennis' ''.<ref name=nytobit/><ref>{{cite web|title=Lacoste on tennis|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/lacoste-on-tennis/oclc/513431|publisher=Worldcat}}</ref>

There are numerous explanations of why Lacoste was originally nicknamed the Crocodile. A 2006 [[New York Times]] obituary about Lacoste's son, Bernard, provides an apparently authoritative one. In the 1920s, supposedly, Lacoste made a bet with his team captain about whether he would win a certain match. The stakes were a suitcase he had seen in a Boston store; it was made of crocodile (or alligator) skin. Later, Ren<U+00E9> Lacoste's friend Robert George embroidered a crocodile onto a blazer that Lacoste wore for his matches.<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Bernard Lacoste, James Freedman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/style/23iht-obits.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 March 2006}}</ref>

===Playing style===
Lacoste was primarily a baseline player who relied on control and accurate, deeply-placed groundstrokes to put pressure on his opponents. In addition he possessed an excellent passing shot and backhand slice. Nicknamed the 'Tennis Machine' for his methodical game and ability to avoid errors he was known as a devoted and hard-working player rather than a player with a great amount of natural talent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Quist|first1=Adrian|title=Tennis : The Greats 1920<U+2013>1960|date=1984|publisher=ABC Enterprises and William Collins|location=Sydney|isbn=9780642527202|page=38|oclc=50097790}}</ref><ref name=chictribune>{{cite news|author1=William Shirer|title=Lacoste beats Borotra; Takes 3d French title|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1929/06/04/page/29/article/lacoste-beats-borotra-takes-3d-french-title|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=4 June 1929|page=29}}</ref> His style was a complete contrast to that of his fellow Musketeer [[Henri Cochet]].<ref name=robertson>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Max|title=The Encyclopedia of Tennis|year=1974|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=London|isbn=9780047960420|pages=168<U+2013>169, 276}}</ref> Lacoste was a studious tactician who meticulously analysed his opponents and kept detailed notes on their strengths and weaknesses.<ref name=collins/><ref name=robertson/>

==Business career==
In 1933, Lacoste founded ''[[Lacoste|La Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Chemise Lacoste]]'' with [[Andr<U+00E9> Gillier]]. The company produced the [[Polo shirt|tennis shirt]], also known as polo shirt, which Lacoste often wore when he was playing, which had a crocodile (often thought to be an alligator) embroidered on the chest. In 1963 his son Bernard took over the management of the company.

In 1961, Lacoste created an innovation in racquet technology by unveiling and patenting the first tubular steel tennis racquet.<ref name=cnn/> Until then, racquets had almost always been made of wood. This new racquet's strings were attached to the frame by a series of wires, which wrapped around the racquet head. The racquet was more resilient and allowed the ball to be hit with more power. The racquet was marketed in Europe under the Lacoste brand, but in the United States it was marketed by Wilson Sporting Goods. [[Pierre Darmon]] debuted the racquet at Wimbledon in 1963 but it achieved critical acclaim and huge popularity as the Wilson T-2000, used by American tennis greats [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Jimmy Connors]].<ref name=cnn/>

The week of his death, French Advertising agency [[Publicis]], who had been managing the account for decades, published a print ad with the Lacoste logo and the English words ''"See you later..."'', reinforcing the idea that the animal was perhaps an [[alligator]].

==Personal life==
On 30 June 1930 he married the famous golfing champion, [[Simone de la Chaume]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rene Lacoste, French Tennis Champion, to Take Golf Star As His Bride at Noon Monday|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pftPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4FQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3205%2C5642364|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=13 June 1930|pages=4-A}}</ref> Their daughter [[Catherine Lacoste]] was a champion [[golf]]er.
