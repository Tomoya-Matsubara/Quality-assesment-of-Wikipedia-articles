'''Peter Copley''' (20 May 1915 &ndash; 7 October 2008) was a British [[television]], [[film]] and [[Theatre|stage]] [[actor]].

==Biography==
Copley was born in [[Bushey]], [[Hertfordshire]], son of the printmakers, John Copley and [[Ethel Gabain]]. 

After changing his mind about joining the [[Royal Navy]], he studied at the [[Old Vic School]] and started out as a stage actor, in 1932. He made his first film appearance in 1934, going on to play a wide variety of characters from the villainous to the meek and mild. In 1946 he appeared on stage in "Cyrano de Bergerac" at the New Theatre in London. Away from acting, Peter Copley was [[Call to the Bar|called to the bar]] in 1963, and was a sharp-witted legal expert and part-time lawyer who successfully handled several court cases in the 1960s.<ref>Anthony Hayward [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-copley-prolific-character-actor-whose-career-lasted-more-than-70-years-1214979.html "Peter Copley: Prolific character actor whose career lasted more than 70 years!",] ''The Independent'', 29 December 2008.</ref>
