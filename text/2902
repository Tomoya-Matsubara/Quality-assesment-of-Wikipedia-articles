'''''Shinano''''' (Japanese:<U+4FE1><U+6FC3>), named after the ancient [[Shinano Province]], was an [[aircraft carrier]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]].  Initially laid down as the third of the [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato'' class battleships]], ''Shinano's'' partially complete hull was converted to an aircraft carrier in 1942, midway through construction.  Over the next two years, ''Shinano'' was heavily modified to act as a large support carrier.  When completed, she had a full-load displacement of 72,000 tons, the largest pre-1954 aircraft carrier built.

Commissioned in November 1944, ''Shinano'' was to transfer from Yokosuka to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure Naval Base]] to complete her fitting out.  While en-route, ''Shinano'' was sunk by the submarine {{USS|Archer-Fish|SS-311|6}} ten days after her commissioning; the result of severe design flaws and poor damage control. ''Shinano'' was largest vessel in history to have ever been sunk by a submarine.

==Design and Construction==
[[File:Shinano photo.jpg|thumb|left|''Shinano'' underway, in what was the only official photo of her ever taken]]

''Shinano'' was initially designed as the third [[Yamato class battleship|''Yamato'' class battleship]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], with her keel laid down in June 1940 at the Yokosuka Naval Dockyard.<ref name=Preston84>Preston, p. 84</ref>  Named after the ancient [[Shinano Province]], the vessel would have been one of the three largest battleships ever constructed.<ref name=Preston84/>  In Summer 1941, construction on ''Shinano's'' hull was temporarily suspended, so as to allow personnel and equipment to be utilized for other naval projects in response to approaching hostilities.<ref name=Preston91>Preston, p. 91</ref>  Had she been completed as a battleship, her armament and armour would have been nearly identical to that of [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] and [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']].<ref name=Preston84/>

Following Japan's disastrous losses at the [[Battle of Midway]]&mdash;in which four of Japan's six fleet carriers were lost&mdash;the decision was made to convert ''Shinano's'' unfinished hull to an Aircraft Carrier.<ref name=Preston91/>  In June 1942, her construction as a ''Yamato'' class battleship was halted, and she was gradually converted to an aircraft carrier.<ref name=cfrecord>{{Cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/Shinano.htm |title= Combined Fleet - tabular history of ''Shinano''|accessdate=27 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |date=}}</ref>  The conversion process placed a heavy emphasis on flight-deck armour, similar to the design of the British [[Illustrious class aircraft carrier|''Illustrious'' class aircraft carrier]]s.  The flight-deck was designed to withstand 1,000 pound bombs, the largest in the arsenal of the [[United States Navy]] that could be carried by dive-bombers.<ref name=Preston84/>  ''Shinano'' was also primarily designed as a support-carrier, with extensive facilities for aircraft repair and refitting.<ref name=Preston91/>  ''Shinano'' herself was intended to have a small fighter complement for defensive purposes, but was not intended to act as a fleet carrier.<ref name=ShinanoClass>{{Cite web |url= http://combinedfleet.com/ship.php?q=shinan_c.htm |title= ''Shinano'' class aircraft carrier|accessdate=27 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Parshall, Jon; Bob Hackett, Sander Kingsepp, & Allyn Nevitt |date=}}</ref><ref name=Preston91/> ''Shinano'' was officially launched  5 October 1944, with Captain [[Toshio Abe]] in overall command of the vessel.  With a total displacement of 72,000 tons,<ref name=ShinanoClass/> ''Shinano'' was the largest aircraft carrier constructed before 1954.<ref>Preston, p. 91. {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, launched in 1954, displaced 80,000 tons.</ref>

The ship's very existence was kept a closely-guarded secret. A tall fence was erected on three sides of the graving dock, and those working on the conversion were confined to the yard compound. Serious punishment<U+2014>up to and including death<U+2014>awaited anyone who breathed a word about Japan's new carrier. As a result, ''Shinano'' was the only major warship built in the 20th century to have never been officially photographed during its construction.<ref name="SeaAssault">{{cite book |last=Enright |first=Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors=James W. Ryan |title=Sea Assault |year=2000 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-97746-8 }} Originally published as ''Shinano!'' (ISBN 031200186X) in [[1987]].</ref>

===Armament===
''Shinano's'' armament differed radically from that of Japan's other aircraft carriers.<ref name=Preston91/>  Shinano's primary defensive armament took the form of 16 {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} guns.<ref name=ShinanoClass/>  Her antiaircraft armament was also significant: 125 {{convert|1|in|mm|adj=on}} antiaircraft guns,<ref name=ShinanoClass/> and 336 {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} antiaircraft rocket launchers in 12 28-barrel turrets.<ref name=Preston84/>  ''Shinano'' was also built to contain a maximum of 120 aircraft within her 870-foot hull.<ref name=Preston84/>

==Commissioning and Loss==
On 19 November 1944, ''Shinano'' was formally commissioned at Yokosuka, having spent the previous two weeks fitting out and performing minor trials.<ref name=cfrecord/>  As a result of growing worry for her safety, Japanese Naval Command ordered ''Shinano'' to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], where the remainder of her fitting-out would take place.<ref name=cfrecord/>  On 28 November 1944, ''Shinano'' departed Yokosuka, with an escort of three destroyers, bound for Kure.  At the time of her departure, the majority of her watertight compartment doors had yet to be installed,<ref name=ShinanoClass/>and the ship had not been tested for watertightness.<ref name="SeaAssault"/>  On her voyage to Kure, ''Shinano'' carried a crew of 2,176 officers and men, as well as 300 shipyard workers and 40 civilian employees.<ref name="SeaAssault"/><ref name=Preston84/> It also carried six "Shinyo" suicide-boats, and fifty [[Ohka]] rockets.<ref name=cfrecord/>

At 21:00 on 28 November, the American submarine {{USS|Archer-Fish|SS-311|2}} picked up ''Shinano''{{'}}s taskgroup on her radar.<ref name=wheeler184>Wheeler, p. 184</ref>  Although ''Shinano'' was faster than ''Archer-Fish'', the sub was able to remain in pursuit of ''Shinano'' due to the zig-zagging pattern of ''Shinano'' and her escorts.<ref name=wheeler184/>  At 03:00 on 29 November, Captain Joseph F. Enright fired six shallow-running torpedoes at ''Shinano'', with four striking the starboard side between the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] and the waterline.<ref name=cfrecord/>  Enright later said he'd deliberately set the torpedoes to run shallow in order to [[capsize]] the target.<ref name="SeaAssault"/>  ''Shinano''{{'}}s destroyer escorts pursued ''Archer-Fish'', forcing the sub to dive.<ref name=wheeler184/>

Though severe, the damage to ''Shinano'' was at first judged to be manageable, and the carrier continued under way.<ref name=cfrecord/>  However, progressive flooding over the next four hours caused ''Shinano'' to list to starboard.  ''Archer-Fish''{{'}}s crew later reported that ''Shinano'' was already listing minutes after the last torpedo hit.<ref name="SeaAssault"/> At dawn, Captain Abe ordered three of the outboard boiler rooms counter-flooded.  Thirty-six miles from where the torpedoes struck, ''Shinano''{{'}}s boiler water feed failed shortly afterwards.<ref name=cfrecord/>  All efforts to control the flooding failed, in part because most of the crew was not well-trained in damage control.<ref name="SeaAssault"/>

At 07:45, ''Shinano'' lost all power.  At 08:50, two of ''Shinano''{{'}}s escorts took her under tow, attempting to beach her on [[Cape Ushio]].  When the carrier continued to list to starboard, the tow-line had to be abandoned.<ref name=cfrecord/>  At 10:18, Abe gave the order to abandon ship, as ''Shinano's'' list continued to increase. At 10:57 on 29 November, ''Shinano'' capsized and sank at {{coord|32|0|N|137|0|E|diaply=inline,title}}, taking 1,400 of her 2,400 crew with her, including Captain Abe and both his navigators.<ref>Wheeler, p. 185</ref> The survivors of ''Shinano''{{'}}s sinking were quarantined in Japan for several months following her sinking.<ref name=cfrecord/>

==Postwar Analysis of the Sinking==

Postwar analysis by the US Naval Technical Mission to Japan concluded that ''Shinano'' had serious design flaws.<ref>Technical Reports, p. 26</ref> Specifically, the joint between the antiprojectile armor on the hull and the anti-torpedo bulge on the underwater body was poorly designed; ''Archer-Fish''{{'}}s torpedoes all exploded along this joint. Additionally, the force of the torpedo explosions dislodged an H-beam in one of the boiler rooms. The dislodged beam turned into a giant battering ram that punched a hole between two of the boiler rooms. In addition, the failure to test for watertightness played a role.<ref name=TR27>Technical Reports, p. 27</ref> Survivors claimed that they were unable to control the flooding because the water poured in too fast; some claimed to have seen rivets between seams burst and allow water to surge through.<ref name="SeaAssault"/>
