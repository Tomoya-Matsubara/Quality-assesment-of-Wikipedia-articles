==Architecture==

The gatehouse has three storeys and "a [[hip roof|hipped roof]] so high and so steep as to be virtually a spire".<ref name=pev/>  The lowest storey is in banded stone, the upper two storeys are in red brick with [[Diapering#Other uses|diapering]] in blue brick and stone dressings, and the roofs have red tiles.  An arched gateway forms the bottom storey and contains an ornate [[wrought iron]] gate.  Under the archway is ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].  Centrally over the gateway is a stone panel containing [[Roll of arms|armorial]] carvings.  Above this are [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]] and [[mullion]]ed windows and at the top is a spirelet (small spire).  One each side of the panel are smaller windows. From each corner of the gateway arises a tourelle (a [[turret]] on a projecting [[corbel]]).  In addition on the right is a circular stair turret with a conical roof.  To the right of the gatehouse is a two-storey wing, the lower storey in banded stone and upper storey [[timber framing|timber-framed]].  To the left is a small single-storey wing, also in banded stone.<ref name=images/><ref name=hub/>

Internally there is an oak spiral staircase and oak doors.  The large room above the gateway contains a fireplace in [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] style.<ref name=images/>
