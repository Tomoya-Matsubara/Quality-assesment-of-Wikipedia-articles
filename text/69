'''Arthur Henry Sarsfield Ward''' (15 February 1883 <U+2013> 1 June 1959), better known as '''Sax Rohmer''', was a prolific English novelist. He is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master criminal Dr. [[Fu Manchu]].<ref name="ja">"Rohmer, Sax" by Jack Adrian in [[David Pringle]], ''St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers''. London : St. James Press, 1998, ISBN 1558622063 (pp. 482<U+2013>4).</ref>

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Birmingham]] to a [[working class|working-class]] Irish Catholic family, he had an entirely [[working class education]] and early career before beginning to write. Rohmer initially pursued a career as a civil servant before concentrating on writing full-time.

He worked as a poet, songwriter, and comedy sketch writer in [[Music Hall]] before creating the Sax Rohmer persona and pursuing a career writing weird fiction.

Like his contemporaries [[Algernon Blackwood]] and [[Arthur Machen]], Rohmer claimed membership to one of the factions of the [[qabbalistic]] [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].<ref>http://www.shadowplayzine.com/Articles/hermetic_horrors.htm</ref> Rohmer also claimed ties to the [[Rosicrucians]], but the validity of his claims has been questioned. His physician and family friend, Dr. R. Watson Councell may have been his only legitimate connection to such organisations. It is believed that Rohmer may have exaggerated his association to boost his literary reputation as an occult writer.

His first published work came in 1903, when the short story "The Mysterious Mummy" was sold to ''Pearson's Weekly''. Rohmer's main literary influences
seem to have been [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[M. P. Shiel]]. 
<ref name="ja" />

He gradually transitioned from writing for [[Music Hall]] performers to concentrating on short stories and serials for magazine publication. In 1909 he married Rose Elizabeth Knox.

He published his first novel ''Pause!'' anonymously in 1910.

==The Fu Manchu series==
After penning ''Little Tich'' in 1911 (as ghostwriter for the famous music hall entertainer of the same name: [[Little Tich]]) he issued the first Fu Manchu novel, ''[[The Mystery of Dr. Fu-Manchu]]'', also serialised from October 1912 <U+2013> June 1913. It was an immediate success, with its fast-paced story of [[Denis Nayland Smith]] and Dr. Petrie facing the worldwide conspiracy of the '[[Yellow Peril]]'. The Fu Manchu stories, together with his more conventional detective series characters<U+2014>Paul Harley, Gaston Max, Red Kerry, Morris Klaw (an [[occult detective]]), and The Crime Magnet<U+2014> made Rohmer one of the most successful and well-paid authors of the 1920s and 1930s. The first three Fu Manchu books were published in the four years 1913<U+2013>17; but it was not until 1931 (some fourteen years after the third book in the series) that Rohmer returned to the series with ''The Daughter of Fu Manchu''. The reason for the long interval was that Rohmer wanted to be well and truly done with the series after ''The Si-Fan Mysteries'', much as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] did with [[Sherlock Holmes]]. The first three books had been successfully filmed by Stoll in the twenties as a pair of serials. In 1928, Rohmer bowed to pressure and agreed to write a fourth novel as a serial for ''Collier's''. Paramount had the first [[Warner Oland]] picture gearing up for production and the daily newspaper strip based on the series was in the offing. There was public demand for the character's return.

Rohmer's first effort at reviving the Fu Manchu property was eventually reworked as ''The Emporer of America''. The original intent had been for the head of the organisation to be Fu Manchu's daughter. He kept Head Centre as a female criminal mastermind to combat Drake Roscoe, but was very unhappy with the book both as it started and in its finished form. He would later return to Drake Roscoe and his female supervillain for the Sumuru series. In the meantime, he tried again to focus his energies on what was first titled ''Fu Manchu's Daughter'' for ''Collier's'' in 1930, but with an older (now knighted) Nayland Smith as the protagonist once more. The results were infinitely better and jump-started the series in the process. 

In the 28 years from 1931 to 1959, Rohmer added no fewer than 10 new books to the Fu Manchu series, meaning the series totals thirteen books in all (not counting the posthumous collection ''The Wrath of Fu Manchu'').

The Fu Manchu series drew much criticism from the Chinese government and Chinese
communities in the US for what was seeing as negative ethnic stereotyping.Sociologist
Virginia Berridge notes Rohmer created a false image of London's 
[[British Chinese|Chinese community]] as crime-ridden,
noting the [[Limehouse]] Chinese were one of the most law-abiding of London's 
ethnic minorities.<ref name="ja"/>    
Critic [[Jack Adrian]] notes that "Rohmer's own [[racism]] was careless and casual, a mere
symptom of his times".<ref name="ja"/>

==Other work==

Rohmer made friends with escape artist [[Harry Houdini]], who wrote to him in praise of Rohmer's ''The Romance of Sorcery''. Rohmer based his mystery-solving magician character Bazarada on Houdini.

''The Orchard of Tears'' is an odd book in the context of Sax Rohmer's other work. There are no oriental villains or exotic locations; rather, there are gentle rabbits and lambs in pastoral settings and a great deal of philosophical musing. As much as he enjoyed Fu Manchu<U+2014>and the notoriety and income the character provided<U+2014>Rohmer had other interests and a markedly serious side. The departure from his expected subject matter is plainly signalled by the book's dedication: 'To the slaves of the pomegranate, sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, who drink at the fountain of life, this chalice is offered as a loving-cup'. ''The Orchard of Tears'' is Rohmer's most restrained and serious novel. 

In ''The Quest of the Sacred Slipper'' (1919) terror comes to Britain when a self-centered archaeologist unearths one of [[Islam]]'s holiest [[relic]]s<U+2014>the sacred slipper of the [[prophet Mohammed]]. Until it is returned to its rightful people, the implacable Hassan of [[Aleppo]] vows his reign of death and destruction shall not cease. Behind these inhuman outrages is a secret group of fanatics. Not even the best men of [[Scotland Yard]] seem able to apprehend them. For, in some mystical way, this phantom band had never been seen or even heard.

''Tales of Chinatown'' (1922) is a collection of ten stories published in hardcover by Cassell in 1922 and Doubleday, Page and Company in 1922. All the stories first appeared in magazine format. This collection includes a story considered one of his best and also anthologised many times; "Tcheriapin." The story "The Hand of the Mandarin Quong" was rewritten for this; first published as "Hand of the White Sheikh" Rohmer changed the setting to a Chinatown background and published it as "The Mystery of the Shriveled Hand," the title then changed for this collection.

Rohmer also wrote several novels of [[Horror film|supernatural horror]], including ''Brood of the Witch-Queen'', described by Adrian as "Rohmer's masterpiece".
<ref name="ja" /><ref>L.D. Allen, "Sax Rohmer",in [[E. F. Bleiler]], ed. ''Supernatural Fiction Writers''. New York: Scribner's, 1985. pp.555<U+2013>560.</ref> Rohmer was very poor at managing his wealth, however, and made several disastrous business decisions that hampered him throughout his career. His final success came with a series of novels featuring a female variation on Fu Manchu, [[Sumuru (literary character)|Sumuru]]. The Sumuru series consist of five books. Rohmer also wrote numerous short stories; "The Master of Hollow Grange" (1920),
is a homage to [[M. R. James]]' story "Lost Hearts", featuring a [[mad scientist]] who
preys on children.<ref name="ja" />
 
After [[World War II]], the Rohmers moved to New York, only returning to London shortly before his death. Rohmer died in 1959 due to an outbreak of [[Influenza A virus subtype H2N2|influenza ("Asian Flu")]]. 

His wife published her own mystery novel, ''Bianca in Black'', in 1958 under the [[pen name]] Elizabeth Sax Rohmer. Some editions of the book mistakenly credit her as Rohmer's daughter. 

Elizabeth Sax Rohmer (1886&ndash;1979) and [[Cay Van Ash]] (1918&ndash;1994), her husband's former assistant, wrote a [[biography]] of the author, ''Master of Villainy'', published in 1972.
