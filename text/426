'''Pomace'''  ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>p<U+028C>m<U+026A>s}}, {{respell|PUM|is}}) is the solid remains of [[grape]]s, [[olive]]s, or other [[fruit]] after [[wine press|pressing]] for juice or oil.  It contains the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems of the fruit.

Grape pomace has traditionally been used to produce [[pomace brandy]] (such as [[grappa]]) and [[Grape seed oil|grapeseed oil]]. Today, it is mostly used as [[fodder]] or [[fertilizer]].

[[Oenocyanin]], a natural red dye and food coloring agent, is produced from grape pomace. Some companies also recover tartrates ([[cream of tartar]]) and grape [[polyphenol]]s from grape pomace.<ref name="Oxford pg 534-535"> J.

==History==
<U+201C>Pomace<U+201D> is derived from the [[Latin]] <U+201C>pomum<U+201D> (apple). The [[English people|English]] were the first to use the term <U+201C>pomace<U+201D> to refer to the byproduct of [[cider]] production.<ref name="Oxford pg 534-535"/>

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[pomace wine]]s with a low alcohol content of three or four percent were widely available. These faux wines were made by adding water to pomace and then [[Fermentation (wine)|fermenting]] it. Generally, medieval wines were not fermented to [[sweetness of wine|dryness]]; consequently the pomace would retain a small amount of fermentable sugar.

===Piquette===
{{main|Piquette}}
The [[Ancient Greeks (wine)|Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] would use pomace to create a wine later known as ''piquette''. This was a low-end wine that was normally given to [[Roman slaves|slaves]] and common workers. After the wine grapes were pressed twice, the pomace was soaked in water for a day and pressed for a third time. The resulting liquid was mixed with more water to produce a thin, weak wine.<ref name="Oxford pg 532"> J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 532 Oxford University Press 2006 ISBN 0198609906 </ref>

==Wines & brandies==
Apple pomace is often used to produce [[pectin]], or can be used to make [[Ciderkin]], a weak cider, while grape pomace is used to produce pomace wine and [[pomace brandy]], such as [[grappa]] (in Italy), [[Pomace brandy|marc]] (in France), [[zivania]] (in Cyprus), [[lozova<U+010D>a]] or [[lozova<U+010D>a|komovica]] (in Croatia), [[Arak  (alcoholic beverage)|Arak]] (in Iran), [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|Raki]] (in Turkey and Albania), [[Orujo]] (in Spain), [[Tsikoudia]] (in Crete), [[Tsipouro]] in northern Greece or [[baga<U+00E7>o]] (in Portugal). There are many other local names and variants such as the English "[[press cake]]".<ref name="Oxford pg 534-535"/>  Essentially all wine-producing cultures started making some form of pomace brandy once the principles of [[distillation]] were understood. 

===Winemaking===
The components of pomace in [[winemaking]] differs on whether white or red wine is being produced. In red wine production, pomace is produced after the free run juice (the juice created before pressing by the weight of [[gravity]]) is poured off, leaving behind dark blackish-red debris consisting of grape skins, stems, as well as dead [[yeast]] cells. The color of red wine is derived from skin contact during the [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] period which can sometime include partial fermentation. The resulting pomace is more alcoholic and [[tannic]] than pomace produced from white wine production. In white wine production, the grapes are quickly pressed after crushing in order to avoid skin contact with pomace being a by product of the pressing. The resulting debris is a pale, greenish-brown color and contains more [[residual sugar]]s than tannins & alcohol. This is the pomace normally used in brandy production.<ref name="Oxford pg 534-535"/>

Pomace is produced in large quantities in wine production with the issue of disposal being an important environmental consideration. Some wineries will reuse the material as fertilizer while others are exploring options of selling the used pomace to [[biogas]] companies to be used in the creation of [[renewable energy]]. As envisioned, pomace would be introduced into [[anaerobic digesters]] that contain [[microorganism]]s that aid in its [[decomposition]] and produce [[methane]] gas that can be combusted to generate power.<ref> Wine Spectator ''"Grapevine"'' Wine Spectator Magazine pg 16, Jan 31st-Feb 29th, 2008 </ref>  However, to make this potential use commercially viable, more research is needed to find methods for improving the digestibility of pomace.

Studies have also shown that specific polyphenols in red wine pomace may be beneficial for [[Oral hygiene|dental hygiene]]. The study conducted at the [[Eastman Dental Center]] found that these polyphenols interferes with ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'', the [[bacteria]] in the mouth which causes [[tooth decay]]. Professor Hyun Koo, the lead researcher of the study, hopes to isolate these polyphenols to produce new [[mouthwash]]es that will help protect against cavities.<ref> ''"[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Red-wine_waste_can_check_cavities/articleshow/2671985.cms Red-wine waste can check cavities]"'' The Times of India, Jan 3rd, 2008 </ref>

A 2004 [[Turkey|Turkish]] study conducted by [[Erciyes University]] found that pomace can also act as a natural [[food preservative]] that could interfere with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' bacterias. Scientist used the dried pomace from the white [[Turkish wine]] grape [[Emir Karasi]] and red [[Kalecik Karasi]] to produce a powder that was mixed [[ethyl acetate]], [[methanol]] or water and exposed to 14 different types of food bacteria. The results showed that all 14 bacterias were inhibited to some degree by the pomace<U+2014>depending on the grape variety and the concentration of the extract. The red wine grape Kalecik Karasi was shown to be the most effective due to what the study researchers believe is the higher concentration of polyphenols in red wine grape skins.<ref>J.
