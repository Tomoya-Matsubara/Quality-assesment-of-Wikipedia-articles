The '''Southeast Asia Treaty Organization''' ('''SEATO''') was an [[international organization]] for [[collective security|collective defense]] in [[Southeast Asia]] created by the '''Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty''', or '''Manila Pact''', signed in September 1954 in [[Manila]]. The formal institution of SEATO was established on 19 February 1955 at a meeting of treaty partners in [[Bangkok]], Thailand.<ref>{{harvnb|Leifer|2005}}</ref> The organization's headquarters were also located in Bangkok. 

Primarily created to block further [[communism|communist]] gains in Southeast Asia, SEATO is generally considered a failure because internal conflict and dispute hindered general use of the SEATO military; however, SEATO-funded cultural and educational programs left long-standing effects in Southeast Asia. SEATO was dissolved on 30 June 1977 after multiple members lost interest and withdrew.

==Origins and structure==

SEATO was created by the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, or Manila Pact, signed on 8 September 1954 in [[Manila]],<ref name=Franklin1>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=1}}</ref> as part of the American [[Truman Doctrine]] of creating anti-communist bilateral and collective defense treaties.<ref>{{harvnb|Jillson|2000|p=439}}</ref> These treaties and agreements were intended to create alliances that would contain communist powers ([[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], in SEATO's case).<ref>{{harvnb|Ooi|2004|pp=338<U+2013>339}}</ref> This policy was considered to have been largely developed by American diplomat and Soviet expert [[George F. Kennan]]. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] (1953<U+2013>1959) was the primary force behind the creation of SEATO, which expanded the concept of anti-communist collective defense to Southeast Asia.<ref name=Franklin1/> 

SEATO was planned to be a Southeast Asian version of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO),<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer et al.|2007|p=836}}</ref> in which the military forces of each member would be coordinated to provide for the collective defense of the members' country.  Organizationally, SEATO was headed by the Secretary General, whose office was created in 1957 at a meeting in [[Canberra]],<ref>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=184}}</ref><ref name=Page548>{{harvnb|Page|2003|p=548}}</ref> with a council of representatives from member nations and an international staff. Also present were committees for economics, security, and information.<ref name=Page548/> SEATO's first Secretary General was [[Pote Sarasin]], a Thai diplomat and politician who had served as Thailand's ambassador to the U.S. between 1952 and 1957,<ref name=Franklin186>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=186}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Weiner|2008|p=351}}</ref> and as Prime Minister of Thailand from September 1957 to 1 January 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinet.thaigov.go.th/eng/pm_his.htm|title=History of Thai Prime Ministers|publisher=Royal Thai Government|accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref>

Unlike the NATO alliance, SEATO had no joint commands with standing forces.<ref name=EB60>{{harvnb|Encyclopaedia Britannica (India)|2000|p=60}}</ref> In addition, SEATO's response protocol in the event of communism presenting a "common danger" to the member nations was vague and ineffective, though membership in the SEATO alliance did provide a rationale for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in the region during the [[Vietnam War]] (1955<U+2013>1975).<ref name=Maga>{{harvnb|Maga|2010}}</ref>

==Membership==
SEATO's members included Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan (including East Pakistan, now Bangladesh), the Philippines, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<ref name=EB60/> The membership reflected a mid-1950s combination of anti-communist Western nations and such nations in Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom and the United States, the latter of which joined after the [[U.S. Senate]] ratified the treaty by a 82<U+2013>1 vote,<ref name=Hearden46>{{harvnb|Hearden|1990|p=46}}</ref> represented the strongest Western powers.<ref name=Tarling604>{{harvnb|Tarling|1992|p=604}}</ref>

Because of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|1954 Geneva Conference]] settling the [[First Indochina War]] (1946<U+2013>1954), South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos were not SEATO members.<ref name=EB60/> They were, however, granted military protection,<ref name=EB60/> though Cambodia rejected the protection in 1956.<ref name=Grenville366>{{harvnb|Grenville|2001|p=366}}</ref> Canada considered joining, but decided against it in order to concentrate on its NATO responsibilities.<ref name=Blaxland138>{{harvnb|Blaxland|2006|p=138}}</ref>

==Military aspects==
[[File:Sabre Mk32s RAAF in Thailand early 1960s.jpg|thumb|250px|Australian No. 79 Squadron Sabres at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand, deployed as part of Australia's commitment to SEATO.|alt=A monoplane aircraft with three men and a fuel tanker truck.

The aircraft is mainly painted grey, but is marked with the Royal Australian Air Force roundel and stripes on its tail. The tail of another aircraft of similar appearance is visible in the background.]]

After its creation, SEATO quickly became insignificant militarily, as most of its member nations contributed very little to the alliance.<ref name=Blaxland138/> While SEATO military forces held training joint military training, they were never employed because of internal disagreements. SEATO was unable to intervene in [[Laotian Civil War|conflicts in Laos]] because France and Britain rejected use of military action.<ref name=Grenville366/> As a result, the U.S. provided unilateral support for Laos after 1962.<ref name=Grenville366/> Though sought by the U.S., involvement of SEATO in the [[Vietnam War]] was denied because of lack of British and French cooperation.<ref name=Hearden46/><ref name=Grenville366/>

Both the United States and Australia cited the alliance as justification for involvement in Vietnam.<ref name=Blaxland138/> American membership in SEATO provided the United States with a rationale for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Maga/> Other countries, such as Great Britain and key nations in Asia, accepted the rationale.<ref name=Maga/> In 1962, as part of its commitment to SEATO, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] deployed [[CAC Sabre]]s of its [[No. 79 Squadron RAAF|No. 79 Squadron]] to [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand. The Sabres began to play a role in the Vietnam War in 1965, when their air defence responsibilities expanded to include protection of [[United States Air Force|USAF]] aircraft using Ubon as a base for strikes against North Vietnam.<ref name=Stephens36>{{harvnb|Stephens|1995|p=36}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Independent Review Panel|title=Report to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence|date=9 July 2004|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/medals/Content/+060%20Reviews%20and%20Reports/Complete%20Ubon%20Report.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref>

==Cultural effects==
In addition to joint military training, SEATO member states worked on improving mutual social and economic issues.<ref name=Franklin183>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=183}}</ref> Such activities were overseen by SEATO's Committee of Information, Culture, Education, and Labor Activities, and proved to be some of SEATO's greatest successes.<ref name=Franklin183/> In 1959, SEATO's first Secretary General, Pote Sarasin, created the [[Asian Institute of Technology|SEATO Graduate School of Engineering]] (currently the Asian Institute of Technology) in Thailand to train engineers.<ref name=Franklin186/> SEATO also sponsored the creation of the Teacher Development Center in Bangkok, as well as the Thai Military Technical Training School, which offered technical programs for supervisors and workmen.<ref name=Franklin188>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=188}}</ref> SEATO's Skilled Labor Project (SLP) created artisan training facilities, especially in Thailand, where ninety-one training workshops were established.<ref name=Franklin188/>

SEATO also provided research funding and grants in agriculture and medical fields.<ref name=Franklin189>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=189}}</ref> In 1959, SEATO set up the Cholera Research Laboratory in Bangkok, later establishing a second Cholera Research Laboratory in [[Dhaka|Dhaka, Bangladesh]].<ref name=Franklin189/> The Dhaka laboratory soon became the world's leading [[cholera]] research facility and was later renamed the [[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh]].<ref>{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|pp=189<U+2013>190}}</ref> SEATO was also interested in literature, and a SEATO Literature Award was created and given to writers from member states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ppat.dbp.gov.my/ppat2001/trislipa.htm|title=Literary Trends and Literary Promotions in Thailand|last=Boonkhachorn|first=Trislipa|accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref>

==Criticism and dissolution==

Though Secretary of State Dulles considered SEATO an essential element in American foreign policy in Asia, historians have considered the Manila Pact a failure and the pact is rarely mentioned in history books.<ref name=Franklin1/> In ''The Geneva Conference of 1954 on Indochina'', [[James Cable|Sir James Cable]], a diplomat and naval strategist,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1359279/Sir-James-Cable.html|title=Sir James Cable|date=13 October 2001|work=www.telegraph.co.uk|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> described SEATO as "a fig leaf for the nakedness of American policy", citing the Manila Pact as a "zoo of paper tigers".<ref name=Franklin1/>

Consequently, questions of dissolving the organization arose. Pakistan withdrew in 1972 after the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971, in which East Pakistan successfully seceded with the aid of India.<ref name=Page548/> France withdrew financial support in 1975.<ref name=EB60/> After a final exercise on 20 February 1976, the organization was formally dissolved on 30 June 1977.<ref name=EB60/>
