[[Air Vice Marshal]] '''William Dowling (Bill) Bostock''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (5 February 1892 &ndash; 28 April 1968) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. During [[World War II]] he led RAAF Command, the Air Force's main operational formation, with responsibility for the defence of Australia and air offensives against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] targets in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]]. His achievements in the role earned him the [[Distinguished Service Order]] and the American [[Presidential Medal of Freedom|Medal of Freedom]]. [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] described him as "one of the world's most successful airmen".

A veteran of [[World War I]], Bostock first saw combat as a soldier in the [[Australian Imperial Force]] at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], then as a pilot in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], where he won the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Croix de guerre]]. He joined the newly formed RAAF in 1921 and by 1941 had risen to become its third most senior officer, serving as Director of Training from 1930 to 1931, [[Commanding Officer]] of [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Squadron]] from 1931 to 1936, and Director of Operations and Intelligence from 1938 to 1939.

The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of World War II, Bostock was considered a leading candidate for the position of [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] in 1942 but was passed over in favour of [[Air Commodore]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], a friend of twenty years. Appointed [[Air Officer Commanding]] RAAF Command soon after, Bostock became involved in a bitter and long-running dispute with Jones over control of the Air Force in the South West Pacific. Following his retirement from the RAAF in 1946, he became a [[journalist]] and later a Federal [[Member of Parliament]].

==Early life==
Bostock was born in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], an inner-city suburb of [[Sydney]], to an English father, also named William, and a Spanish mother, Mary. He was educated at The School in [[Mount Victoria, New South Wales|Mount Victoria]], in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] region of [[New South Wales]], where he completed his junior certificate.<ref name="Garrison">Garrison, ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', pp.224&ndash;225</ref><ref name="High Fliers">Stephens and Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.50&ndash;53</ref> The family later moved to [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], in Sydney's [[Inner West (Sydney)|Inner West]]. After leaving school Bostock was employed as an [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] with the [[Marconi Company]] for two-and-a-half years,<ref>[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp?B=3099633&I=1&SE=1 AIF personnel file (p.1)] at [[National Archives of Australia]].

==World War I==
In November 1914, Bostock joined the 2nd Signal Troop of the [[Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) as a [[sapper]].<ref name="Garrison"/><ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/nominalrolls/ww1/embarkation/person.asp?p=140725 First World War Embarkation Roll: William Dowling Bostock] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

Bostock transferred from the AIF to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] Special Reserve on 18 February 1917, and was commissioned as a probationary [[Second Lieutenant]]. He was posted to [[No. 48 Squadron RAF|No. 48 Squadron]] in August, following pilot training in Egypt and England.<ref name="Garrison"/><ref name="AIF personnel file p.4"/> Bostock fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and was awarded the Belgian [[Croix de guerre]].<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=30631|startpage=4523|date=12 April 1918|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=14 October}}</ref> He was invalided back to Britain in March 1918, after which he transferred to the newly created [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).<ref name="Garrison"/>

==Inter-war years==
Bostock married his Australian fianc<U+00E9>e, Gwendolen Norton, in [[Southampton]] on 6&nbsp;March 1919. The couple had two daughters, one of whom, Gwendolen Joan, would serve as a [[cipher]] officer in the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF) during [[World War II]].<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', p.337</ref> Bostock retired from the RAF and returned to civilian life in Australia that October.<ref name="Garrison"/> On 14&nbsp;September 1921, he joined the recently formed [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) and was commissioned a [[Flight Lieutenant]].

[[Image:P00448.195RichmondWapitis.jpg|thumb|left|Westland Wapitis of No. 3 Squadron, commanded by Bostock, in the Richmond area, October 1932]]

===Deputy Chief of the Air Staff===
[[Image:AWM012245BostockBurnett.jpg|thumb|right|Air Vice Marshal Bostock (right) was Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett (left), pictured in 1942]]
The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff position that Bostock occupied at the outbreak of World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy had the authority to act in place of the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on a Joint Planning Committee.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/03.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp.69&ndash;70]</ref> He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in [[Singapore]] in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/07.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp.143&ndash;144]</ref> Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting [[Air Commodore]] on 1&nbsp;June 1940 and substantive [[Air Vice Marshal]] on 1&nbsp;October 1941.<ref name="High Fliers"/><ref name="Helson p.44">Helson, ''"10 Years at the Top"'', p.44</ref> He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1942 [[New Years Honours]].<ref name="Honours and Awards">[http://www.awm.gov.au/honours/honours/person.asp?p=bb434 Honours and Awards (Gazetted): William Dowling Bostock] at Australian War Memorial.

===Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command===
In August 1942, [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], Supreme Commander SWPA, replaced Lieutenant General Brett with [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] (later General) [[George Kenney]]. Kenney created two new formations subordinate to Allied Air Forces Headquarters: the U.S. [[Fifth Air Force]] and RAAF Command. Bostock was chosen to be [[Air Officer Commanding]] RAAF Command,<ref name="Stephens pp.116-119"/> with twenty-four Australian squadrons at his disposal plus one each from the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]].<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.01 pp.4-6">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/01.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.4&ndash;6]</ref> The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under Bostock's command were those based in [[Territory of New Guinea|New Guinea]] as [[No. 9 Operational Group RAAF]] (9OG), controlled by Fifth Air Force.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.01 pp.4-6"/><ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/28.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp.585&ndash;588]</ref> RAAF Command was charged with defending Australia, except in the north-east, protecting the sea lanes to New Guinea, and [[North Western Area Campaign|conducting operations]] against Japanese shipping, airfields and other installations in the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name="Garrison"/>

By the end of 1943, 9OG, originally the RAAF's mobile strike force, had become engaged in static garrison duties in New Guinea. Bostock proposed that it be renamed Northern Area Command to better reflect its current function. Kenney asked Bostock to raise a new RAAF mobile formation, which led to the establishment of No.&nbsp;10 Operational Group (10OG) on 13&nbsp;November 1943 at [[Lae Nadzab Airport|Nadzab]], under the command of Group Captain [[Frederick Scherger]].<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.182&ndash;183]</ref> In February 1944, RAAF Command took over many of the units of 9OG, as well as responsibility for the [[Port Moresby]] and [[Milne Bay]] sectors. Bostock again recommended changing 9OG's name to Northern Area, and also proposed changing 10OG's name to Tactical Air Force, RAAF, in view of its increased strength from the infusion of new squadrons. On 11&nbsp;April, 9OG became Northern Command.<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/12.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.198&ndash;200]</ref> On 14&nbsp;September 1944, Bostock had an audience with Prime Minister Curtin, wherein the latter outlined his preferences for the deployment of RAAF Command, particularly that it should be represented in forward Allied operations, and employed primarily in the support of Australian ground forces. Bostock concurred with Curtin; the Prime Minister meanwhile authorised changing 10OG's name to [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|First Tactical Air Force]], with effect from 25&nbsp;October. RAAF Command's complement had now swelled to forty-one Australian squadrons.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.17 pp.296-299">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/17.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.296&ndash;299]</ref>

On 15&nbsp;March 1945, Bostock established a forward headquarters on [[Morotai|Morotai Island]] to directly control 1TAF for the upcoming [[Borneo campaign (1945)|Oboe]] operations, the reoccupation of [[Borneo]]. Kenney gave him responsibility for all Allied air operations south of the Philippines, and the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) units which were based in the [[Solomon Islands]] to support the [[Bougainville Campaign]] were assigned to RAAF Command.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.26 p.435">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.435]</ref><ref name="Stephens pp.169-170">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.169&ndash;170</ref> Bostock wrote to Kenney, "I am particularly anxious that the 1st Tactical Air Force should continue to be employed as a forward offensive formation rather than in a garrison role".<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.26 p.435"/> In April, Kenney's Allied Air Headquarters issued an order that Bostock would be named Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAAF Command, because he had several Air Officers Commanding (AOCs) reporting to him. Bostock duly passed on this change of nomenclature to his subordinate units but Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne vetoed the change in June.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.26 p.439">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.439]</ref> 

Bostock had control of the USAAF Fifth and [[Thirteenth Air Force]]s, as well as 1TAF, during [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Operation Oboe One]], the invasion of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]], commencing 1&nbsp;May 1945.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.27 p.452">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/27.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', p.452]</ref> By this time RAAF Command comprised some 17,000 personnel.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.26 p.439"/> On [[Operation Oboe Six]], the invasion of [[Labuan]]-[[Brunei]] in June, Bostock also had at his disposal aircraft based in Australia at Western and North-Western Area Commands.<ref name="Air War Against Japan ch.28 pp.475-477">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/28.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.475&ndash;477]</ref> For [[Battle of Balikpapan (1945)|Operation Oboe Two]], the invasion of Balikpapan in July, Bostock marshalled forty Allied squadrons. His aim, in concert with that of Kenney and [[I Corps (Australia)|I&nbsp;Corps]] commander [[Leslie Morshead|Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead]], was to deliver the heaviest aerial bombardment possible against enemy targets, to enable Australian assault forces to land with minimal casualties. Together with a naval barrage, this resulted in a "scene of indescribable ruin" on the battlefield, and allowed seventeen waves of troops to disembark their landing craft without loss.<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/29.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.482&ndash;484]</ref> MacArthur called the Labuan air offensive "flawless",<ref name="Garrison"/> while [[Thomas Blamey|General Sir Thomas Blamey]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Australian Military Forces]], congratulated Bostock on his "high order of control" and "ready and full cooperation" throughout the Borneo campaign.<ref name="Stephens pp.169-170"/>

===Rivalry with George Jones===
From 1942, the structure of the RAAF was divided such that Bostock was in operational charge of the Air Force in the South West Pacific but relied on [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|Air Vice Marshal Jones]] as CAS for supplies of manpower and equipment, while Jones was nominally in command of the entire RAAF but played no part in directing its major air operations against Japan.<ref name="Odgers">Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.42&ndash;43</ref><ref>Horner, "The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements", p.13</ref> The situation was a source of "acute personal tension" between the two senior officers for the remainder of the war.<ref name="Odgers"/> It was exacerbated by the fact that while the CAS was ''[[de jure]]'' head of the RAAF, Jones' rank of Air Vice Marshal was no higher than Bostock's.  Air Force historian Dr Alan Stephens later commented: "The system of divided command&nbsp;... was not an ideal arrangement, but with men of goodwill it could have worked. Regrettably Bostock and Jones were not of that mind&nbsp;..."<ref name="Stephens pp.120-122">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.120&ndash;122</ref> 

[[Image:Jones-Bostock-Burnett AWM 012249.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|left|Bostock (centre) with newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal George Jones (left), and former CAS, Air Chief Marshal Burnett, in 1942]]
Bostock's relationship with Kenney permitted him to ignore operational requests from Jones,<ref>Helson, ''"10 Years at the Top"'', pp.132,159</ref> while Jones continued to assert administrative control over Bostock<U+2019>s command.<ref name="Gillison">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/28.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp.595&ndash;596]</ref> When Jones tried to remove Bostock from RAAF Command in April 1943 and replace him with Air Commodore Joe Hewitt, AOC of No.&nbsp;9 Operational Group, Bostock appealed to Kenney, who advised Jones that he was opposed to any such change of command. Kenney threatened to escalate the matter to the Australian government, and some time later MacArthur told Curtin that Hewitt "was not an adequate replacement" for Bostock.<ref>Helson, ''"10 Years at the Top"'', pp.123&ndash;126</ref> The matter was allowed to drop,<ref>Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/01.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.16&ndash;18]</ref> but the rivalry continued. In January 1945, an acrimonious series of cables was exchanged between the two Air Vice Marshals. Jones complained to Bostock of the latter's "insubordinate tone" and "repeated attempts to usurp authority of this Headquarters". Bostock replied that as AOC RAAF Command he was "responsible to Commander, Allied Air Forces, and not, repeat not, subordinate to you<U+201D>, and that he would "continue to take the strongest exception to your unwarranted and uninformed interference".<ref name="Air War Against Japan pp.436-437">Odgers, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/26.pdf ''Air War Against Japan'', pp.436&ndash;437]</ref> 

Their feud was blamed for contributing to the low morale that precipitated the so-called "[[Morotai Mutiny]]" of April 1945, when a group of senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force submitted their resignations rather than continue to attack what they believed to be worthless targets.<ref name="Cleaning the augean stables">Alexander, "Cleaning the augean stables"</ref> Alerted to the issue by 1TAF's commander, Air Commodore [[Arthur Henry Cobby|Harry Cobby]], Bostock appealed to the pilots to withdraw their resignations. His methods were construed as an attempt to "make the situation go away or to at least cover it up"; one of the "mutineers", Squadron Leader John Waddy, quoted Bostock as saying, "I will leave these applications on the table and if you pick them up, all records and all notes of any of this affair will be expunged from Air Force records and files and nothing will be heard about it".<ref name="Cleaning the augean stables"/> When the pilots refused to drop the matter, Bostock signalled Jones, advising that he found morale on the island to be at a "dangerously low level" and recommending the CAS replace Cobby with Air Commodore [[Frederick Scherger]].<ref name="Odgers">Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 122&ndash;123</ref> Kenney concurred with Bostock, and Jones sacked Cobby.<ref name="Stephens pp.123-125">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.123&ndash;125</ref> A subsequent investigation vindicated the stand taken by the pilots; one of them, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry of Jones and Bostock: "I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it."<ref name="Cleaning the augean stables"/>

The conflict between the commanders reached its nadir during the [[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|invasion of Tarakan]] in May 1945, when Jones grounded RAAF bomber squadrons scheduled to take part in the attack due to their crews having exceeded their monthly quota of flying hours. Bostock was not consulted about the decision and fully expected to see Australian aircraft as he watched for the Allied formations from a U.S. warship during the battle. He later said that he would have thankfully "fallen through a crack in the boards on the deck" when he saw only American aircraft flying overhead, and had to apologise to Kenney for the RAAF's absence.<ref name="Stephens pp.120-122"/> The dual system of control and the tension between its two senior officers confused the RAAF's efforts in the field and reduced its influence on Allied strategy in the Pacific.<ref name="Dennis"/>

Bostock went into journalism after his retirement from the military, and become an aviation correspondent for ''The Herald''. He wrote a series of articles criticising the Air Force's organisation and presenting his side of the story of RAAF Command, motivated partly by his belief that the [[Australia in the War of 1939<U+2013>1945|official history of Australia in World War II]] would fail to adequately cover it. The articles caused considerable controversy and prompted the Minister for Air, [[Arthur Drakeford]], to make a formal response in Federal Parliament, labelling Bostock's allegations "malicious and unjustified".<ref>Helson, ''"10 Years at the Top"'', pp.243&ndash;249</ref> 

Bostock was decorated twice in 1948 for his war service, in March with the [[Distinguished Service Order]] "in recognition of distinguished services whilst in command of air operations in the Borneo Campaign during the period March to September, 1945",<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=38238 |startpage=1869|date=12 May 1948|accessyear=2008|accessdaymonth=14 October}}</ref> and in April with the American [[Presidential Medal of Freedom|Medal of Freedom with Silver Palm]].<ref name="Honours and Awards"/>  He entered politics in 1949, standing as a [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] candidate for the Federal [[Division of Indi]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], he retained his seat until being defeated in the 1958 poll. Bostock served on a joint committee for foreign affairs and sometimes came into conflict with his own party on matters of defence policy. He continued to contribute to ''The Herald'' while in government.<ref name="Garrison"/> During parliamentary debates in 1951 and again in 1957, Bostock spoke for "an integrated defence force with a single minister", advocating amalgamation of the four separate Departments of Defence, Air, Navy and Army into one Department of Defence, headed by the Minister for Defence. He further proposed that a single Commander-in-Chief lead the Army, Navy and Air Force; the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]], the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of the Naval Staff]], and the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] would report directly to the new position.<ref>{{cite hansard | url= | house=Australian House of Representatives | date=25 October 1951 | page_start=1234 | page_end=1237 }}</ref><ref>{{cite hansard | url= | house=Australian House of Representatives | date=14 November 1957 | page_start=2241 | page_end=2242 }}</ref> In 1973 the single-service departments were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], and by 1984 a [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] position had evolved to directly command all three armed services through their respective chiefs.<ref>Horner, "The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements", pp.24&ndash;27</ref> 

Bostock's wife Gwendolen died in 1947, and he married 33-year-old Nanette O'Keefe in Melbourne on 1&nbsp;June 1951; they had three sons. He owned a property near [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]], in rural Victoria, where he died in 1968. Survived by his second wife and his five children, Bostock was accorded an Air Force funeral and cremated.<ref name="Garrison"/>
