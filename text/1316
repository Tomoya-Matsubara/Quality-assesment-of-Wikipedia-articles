'''Bikhakhanim''' was the reigning princess of a small [[polity]] located on the [[Taman Peninsula]] in southern [[Russia]]. She may have been of [[Circassians|Circassian]], [[Georgian people|Georgian]], or [[Cuman]] origin. The Russian historian [[F. K. Brun]], suggests that the name of the princess might not have been "Bikhakhanim," but "Bikhakhatun,"<ref>Brun ii. 386.</ref> and that, if so, she was the daughter of the Georgian prince [[Beka II Jakeli]] (died  1391), the ruler of [[Samtskhe]] and [[Klarjeti]].<ref>Brosset ii. 206.</ref> 

However, "Beki" means "Ruling Woman" in [[Mongolian]] and "Khanim" was the Medieval title of a female patrilineal [[Descent from Genghis Khan|descendant of Genghis Khan]] (equivalent to "Khan" for a male). 1419 was the year that the sons of [[Tokhtamysh]] [[Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]] killed his rival [[Edigu]] the Khan of the [[Nogai Horde]] as a continuation of the [[Tokhtamysh<U+2013>Timur war]] and reestablished control over the region.

Bikhakhanim was married in 1419 to the [[Genoa|Genoese]] [[Jew]] [[Simeone de Guizolfi]], who through this marriage became ruler of that country under Genoese overlordship. One of his heirs, [[Zacharias de Guizolfi]], was still reigning in 1482.
