'''Robley Cook Williams''' ([[1908]] - [[January 3]], [[1995]]) was an early [[biophysicist]] and [[virologist]]. He served as the first President of the [[Biophysical Society]].

==Career==
Williams attended [[Cornell University]] on an athletic scholarship, completing a B.S. in 1931 and a Ph.D. in [[physics]] in 1935. He was also selected for membership in the [[Quill and Dagger]] society. Williams began his career as a researcher as an [[assistant professor]] of [[astronomy]] at the [[University of Michigan]], and from 1945, [[associate professor]] of physics. A growing fascination with viruses lead him to leave Michigan in 1950, when he was invited to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] by [[Wendell Stanley]], to serve as a [[professor]] at the newly created Department of Virology.<ref>Biophysical Society biography [http://www.biophysics.org/publications/cook-williams.pdf]</ref>

==Research==
Together with [[Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat]], Williams studied the [[Tobacco mosaic virus]], and showed that a functional virus could be created out of purified [[RNA]] and a [[protein]] coat. That same year, he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Williams was involved in the early use of [[Electron microscope|electron micrograph]]y in biology,<ref>Williams in [[Linus Pauling]] papers. [http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/narrative/page19.html]</ref> and also helped develop biophysical techniques such as freeze etching and particle-counting by the spray-drop technique.<ref>Biophysical Society biography</ref>

==Personal==
His son, Robley C. Williams, Jr., is a [[professor emeritus]] of biological science at [[Vanderbilt University]].
