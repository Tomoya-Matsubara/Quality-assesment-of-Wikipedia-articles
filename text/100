In [[astronomy]], the '''Pleiades''' ({{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|l|a<U+026A>|.|<U+0259>|d|i<U+02D0>|z}} or {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|p|l|i<U+02D0>|.|<U+0259>|d|i<U+02D0>|z}}), or '''Seven Sisters''' ('''[[Messier object|Messier object 45]]''' or '''M45'''), is an [[open cluster|open star cluster]] containing middle-aged hot [[Stellar classification#Hot B emission star classes|B-type stars]] located in the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. It is among the nearest [[star cluster]]s to Earth and is the cluster most obvious to the [[naked eye]] in the [[night sky]]. The celestial entity has several [[Pleiades in folklore and literature|meanings in different cultures and traditions]].

The cluster is dominated by [[Stellar classification#Hot blue emission star classes|hot blue and extremely luminous]] stars that have formed within the last 100 million years. Dust that forms a faint [[reflection nebula|reflection nebulosity]] around the brightest stars was thought at first to be left over from the formation of the cluster (hence the alternate name '''Maia Nebula''' after the star [[Maia (star)|Maia]]), but is now known to be an unrelated dust cloud in the [[interstellar medium]], through which the stars are currently passing. Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades was probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the [[Orion Nebula]].<ref>Kroupa, P., Aarseth, S.J., Hurley, J. 2001, MNRAS, 321, 699, "The formation of a bound star cluster: from the Orion nebula cluster to the Pleiades" [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001MNRAS.321..699K]</ref> Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.<ref>{{cite book | last = Gendler | first =Robert| title =A Year in the Life of the Universe: A Seasonal Guide to Viewing the Cosmos| publisher = Voyageur Press | year = 2006| page = 54 | isbn = 1610603400}}</ref>

==Observational history==
The Pleiades are a prominent sight in winter in both the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]], and have been known since antiquity to cultures all around the world, including the [[M<U+0101>ori culture|M<U+0101>ori]], [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal Australians]], the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the [[Arab people|Arabs]] (known as ''Thurayya''), the [[China|Chinese]], the [[Japan]]ese, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], the [[Aztec]], and the [[Sioux]] and [[Cherokee]]. In [[Tamil culture]] this star cluster is attributed to Lord [[Murugan]] (Lord Murugan raised by the six sisters known as the [[K<U+0101>rththikai Pengal]] and thus came to be known as [[Murugan|K<U+0101>rtikeyan]]). In Sanskrit he is known as [[Murugan|Skanda]].
[[File:Nebra Scheibe.jpg|thumb|The [[Nebra sky disk]], dated c. 1600 BC. The cluster of dots in the upper right portion of the disk is believed to be the Pleiades.]]

The [[Babylonian star catalogues]] name the Pleiades MUL.MUL or "star of stars", and they head the list of stars along the ecliptic, reflecting the fact that they were close to the point of [[vernal equinox]] around the 23rd century BC. The earliest known depiction of the Pleiades is likely a [[bronze age]] artifact known as the [[Nebra sky disk]], dated to approximately 1600 BC. Some [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] astronomers considered them to be a distinct [[constellation]], and they are mentioned by [[Hesiod]], and in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. They are also mentioned three times in the [[Bible]] ([[Book of Job|Job]] 9:9 and 38:31, as well as [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 5:8). The Pleiades ([[Krittika]]) are particularly revered in [[Hindu mythology]] as the six mothers of the war god [[Murugan]], who developed six faces, one for each of them. Some scholars of [[Islam]] suggested that the Pleiades (ath-thurayya) are the star mentioned in the sura (chapter) [[Najm]] of the [[Quran]].

In [[Japan]], the constellation is mentioned under the name Mutsuraboshi ("six stars") in the 8th century [[Kojiki]] and [[Manyosyu]] documents. The constellation is also known in Japan as Subaru (<U+201C>unite<U+201D>) and is depicted in the logo and name of the [[Subaru]] automobile company.  The Persian equivalent is [[Nahid]] (pronounced "Naheed").

The rising of the Pleiades is mentioned in the Ancient Greek text ''[[Geoponica]]''.<ref>http://www.ancientlibrary.com/geoponica/0028.html {{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref> The Greeks oriented the [[Hecatompedon]] temple of 550 BC and the [[Parthenon]] of 438 BC to their rising.<ref>[http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/105/JL27179.pdf?sequence=2 On the Rising of the Pleiades]</ref>

They have long been known to be a physically related group of stars rather than any chance alignment. The Reverend [[John Michell]] calculated in 1767 that the probability of a chance alignment of so many bright stars was only 1 in 500,000, and so correctly surmised that the Pleiades and many other clusters of stars must be physically related.<ref>

[[Charles Messier]] measured the position of the cluster and included it as M45 in his [[Messier object|catalogue]] of [[comet]]-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the [[Orion Nebula]] and the [[Beehive Cluster|Praesepe]] cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets<U+2014>something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|Lacaille]], whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.<ref>

==Distance==
[[File:Pleiades-comet-Machholz.jpeg|thumb|[[Comet Machholz]] appears to pass near the Pleiades in early 2005]]
[[File:The Pleiades (M45).jpg|thumbnail|An amateur photograph taken with a DSLR camera.]]

The distance to the Pleiades can be used as an important first step to calibrate the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the distance to the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the distance to the Pleiades discussed below is a [[red herring]], since the [[cosmic distance ladder]] can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]], [[Coma Star Cluster|Coma Berenices cluster]], etc.).<ref name=majaess11/>

Measurements of the distance have elicited much controversy. Results prior to the launch of the [[Hipparcos]] satellite generally found that the Pleiades were about 135 [[parsec]]s away from Earth. Data from Hipparcos yielded a surprising result, namely a distance of only 118 parsecs by measuring the [[parallax]] of stars in the cluster<U+2014>a technique that should yield the most direct and accurate results. Later work consistently argued that the Hipparcos distance measurement for the Pleiades was erroneous.<ref name=majaess11/><ref name="Percival"/><ref name="Zwahlen" /><ref name=soderblom05>

==Composition==
[[File:X-ray image of the Pleiades.gif|thumb|right|[[X-ray]] images of the Pleiades reveal the stars with the hottest atmospheres. Green squares indicate the seven optically brightest stars.]]

The cluster core radius is about 8 [[light year]]s and [[roche limit|tidal radius]] is about 43 light years. The cluster contains over 1,000 statistically confirmed members, although this figure excludes unresolved [[binary star]]s.<ref name="Adams, Joseph D. 2053">

The cluster contains many [[brown dwarf]]s, which are objects with less than about 8% of the [[Sun]]'s mass, not heavy enough for [[nuclear fusion]] reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% of the total population of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass.<ref>

 |issue=3 }}</ref> Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.

==Age and future evolution==
Ages for star clusters can be estimated by comparing the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] for the cluster with theoretical models of [[stellar evolution]]. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages is a result of uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as [[convective overshoot]], in which a [[convection|convective]] zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.

Another way of estimating the age of the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal [[main sequence]] stars, [[lithium]] is rapidly destroyed in [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. [[Brown dwarf]]s can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 million [[kelvin]], the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.<ref>

The cluster is [[relative motion|slowly moving]] in the direction of the feet of what is currently the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with [[molecular cloud|giant molecular clouds]] and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.

==Reflection nebulosity==
[[File:Reflection nebula IC 349 near Merope.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hubble Space Telescope]] image of reflection nebulosity near [[Merope (star)|Merope]] ([[IC 349]])]]

Under ideal observing conditions, some hint of nebulosity may be seen around the cluster, and this shows up in long-exposure photographs. It is a [[reflection nebula]], caused by dust reflecting the blue light of the hot, young stars.

It was formerly thought that the dust was left over from the [[star formation|formation]] of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by [[radiation pressure]]. Instead, it seems that the cluster is simply passing through a particularly dusty region of the [[interstellar medium]].

Studies show that the dust responsible for the nebulosity is not uniformly distributed, but is concentrated mainly in two layers along the line of sight to the cluster. These layers may have been formed by deceleration due to [[radiation]] pressure as the dust has moved towards the stars.<ref>

==Brightest stars==
The nine brightest stars of the Pleiades are named for the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Seven Sisters]] of [[Greek mythology]]: [[Sterope (Pleiad)|Sterope]], [[Merope (Pleiades)|Merope]], [[Electra (Pleiad)|Electra]], [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]], [[Taygete|Taygeta]], [[Celaeno]], and [[Alcyone (Pleiades)|Alcyone]], along with their parents [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]]. As daughters of Atlas, the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]] were sisters of the Pleiades. The English name of the cluster itself is of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, though of uncertain etymology.<!-- Traditionally, it has simply meant "daughters of Pleione", but the name may predate the myth of seven sisters. --> Suggested derivations include: from <U+03C0><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+00EE><U+03BD> ''ple<U+00EE>n'', to sail, making the Pleiades the "sailing ones"; from ''pleos'', full or many; or from ''[[peleiades]]'', flock of doves. The following table gives details of the brightest stars in the cluster:

==Possible planets==
Analyzing deep-infrared images obtained by the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] and [[Gemini Observatory|Gemini North telescope]], astronomers discovered that one of the cluster's stars <U+2013> [[HD 23514]], which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than those of the sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. This could be an evidence for planets formation around HD 23514.<ref>
