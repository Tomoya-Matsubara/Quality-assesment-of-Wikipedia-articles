===2005===
In 2005, the young Frenchman made one of the biggest moves in the top 50 from the previous season, climbing 200 ranking spots. He finished the year as the no. 3 Frenchman (behind no. 16 [[Richard Gasquet]], no. 26 [[S<U+00E9>bastien Grosjean]]) and captured his first ATP title, while reaching two additional finals.<ref>{{cite web|title=ATP <U+2013> Singles Ranking|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Singles.aspx?d=26.12.2005&r=1&c=#|publisher=ATP|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=26 December 2005}}</ref> In the first six months, he won Challenger titles in [[Besan<U+00E7>on]], defeating [[Christophe Rochus]],  and [[Tunis]] (defeating Santoro), and also reached the fourth round at the [[2005 NASDAQ-100 Open|Miami Masters]] (losing to Hrbaty) and a Grand Slam best third round appearance at [[2005 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] (losing to [[Mario An<U+010D>i<U+0107>]]). He compiled a 10<U+2013>14 record in ATP level play and 12<U+2013>1 in Challengers through July.

In the last three months, he went 15<U+2013>8, highlighted by his first ATP clay title at the Idea Prokom Open in Sopot defeating [[Florian Mayer]] in the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monfils wins breakthrough title|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/4129560.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=7 August 2005}}</ref>  Then he struggled with a 2<U+2013>5 mark before reaching the final in two of the last three indoor tournaments of the season, both in his native country in [[Open de Moselle|Metz]] (losing to Ljubi<U+010D>i<U+0107>) and [[Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon|Lyon]] (losing to Roddick). He went 11<U+2013>4 in tie-breaks and 1<U+2013>2 vs. top-10 opponents, defeating no. 10 [[Gast<U+00F3>n Gaudio]] in his first match of the season in Doha. He compiled records of 12<U+2013>10 on hard courts, 6<U+2013>7 on clay, 5<U+2013>2 on carpet, and 2<U+2013>3 on grass.

===2006===
In his first tournament of 2006, in [[Doha]], he reached the final, but lost 3<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>7 to world no. 1 [[Roger Federer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Federer shows he will still be the force in 2006|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tennis/federer-primed/2006/01/08/1136655088076.html|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=January 9, 2006}}</ref>  In a surprising event in Las Vegas, there was a tennis paddle tournament held by the Tennis Channel. Monfils was given a wildcard into the doubles event, but became more interested and inquired about getting a singles wildcard into the main draw. However, he received an entry into the qualifying singles (which he won). Monfils competed in the main draw of this [[Paddle tennis]] tournament and surprised everyone when he ousted world no. 1 paddle tennis player [[Scott Freedman]] and eventually went on to win the whole tournament.

Later on in 2006, Monfils reached the semifinals of the Rome [[Tennis Masters Series]], before losing to eventual champion [[Rafael Nadal]]. En route to the semifinals, Monfils defeated former world no. 1 [[Andy Roddick]]. He then entered the [[2006 Hamburg Masters|Hamburg Masters]] event, where he lost in straight sets to fellow teenager [[Andy Murray]] in the first round. After that, he faced Murray once more, this time in the first round of the French Open. After a gruelling five<U+2013>set battle, Monfils emerged victorious. Monfils then proceeded to play the Belgian [[Dick Norman]] in the second round. Once again, the match went to five sets, and Monfils got the better of his formidable opponent. Monfils then faced his toughest opponent yet, the American [[James Blake]]. Blake was the favourite for the win, as he was eighth seed, while Monfils was 25th seed. However, Monfils defeated Blake in another five-set match. Monfils described this run as a marathon. Blake said of Monfils that 'he was the fastest man on the tour'. The fourth round was Monfils' last, as he lost to [[Novak Djokovi<U+0107>]] in straight sets. Monfils said after the match: 'I am disappointed that I didn't take the opportunity, but you can expect me to return next year'. Monfils then left the court to a standing ovation.

As a result of his progress at the French Open, Monfils moved up five positions to reach a career high of no. 23. This also made him the no. 1 player in France, two positions ahead of S<U+00E9>bastien Grosjean.<ref>{{cite web|title=ATP <U+2013> Singles Rankings|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Singles.aspx?d=12.06.2006&r=1&c=#|publisher=ATP|accessdate=9 October 2012|date=12 June 2006}}</ref> 

Monfils then entered the [[Stella Artois Championships]], where he won his first-round match against [[J<U+00FC>rgen Melzer]]. He then played the American [[Bobby Reynolds]] and won in straight sets. His third-round encounter was the third time he faced the world no. 4 [[Ivan Ljubi<U+010D>i<U+0107>]]. Though the odds were against his, Monfils triumphed in straight sets, 7<U+2013>6, 7<U+2013>5. His quarterfinal draw was with [[James Blake]], whom he had met earlier at the French Open. This time Blake succeeded. After having lost a set, Monfils retired as a result of a back injury. This injury effectively ruled him out of the Nottingham championships the following week.

At the [[2006 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], Monfils suffered a surprising first-round exit when defeated by [[Igor Kunitsyn]]. Monfils won the first set, but ended up losing the next three, 7<U+2013>5, 6<U+2013>7, 3<U+2013>6, 4<U+2013>6.

===2007===

Monfils had a good run in [[Hypo Group Tennis International|Poertschach]] as a warm-up for the French Open.

Monfils made it to the semifinals of the [[2007 Legg Mason Tennis Classic]], before losing to American [[John Isner]] in a 7<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>7, 6<U+2013>7 match. Monfils withdrew from the [[2007 US Open (tennis)|2007 US Open]] with a hamstring injury. He also was forced to withdraw from the [[2008 Australian Open]] due to the same injury.
