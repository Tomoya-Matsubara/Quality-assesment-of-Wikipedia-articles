In [[mathematics]], the '''Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral''', also known as the '''Denjoy integral''' (pronounced {{IPA-fr|d<U+0251><U+0303><U+02C8><U+0292>wa|}}) and the '''Perron integral''', is one of a number of definitions of the [[integral]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]. It is a generalization of the [[Riemann integral]] which in some situations is more useful than the [[Lebesgue integral]]. 

This integral was first defined by [[Arnaud Denjoy]] (1912). Denjoy was interested in a definition that would allow one to integrate functions like 

:<math>f(x)=\frac{1}{x}\sin\left(\frac{1}{x^3}\right).</math>

This function has a singularity at 0, and is not Lebesgue integrable. However, it seems natural to calculate its integral except over [&minus;<U+03B5>,<U+03B4>] and then let <U+03B5>, <U+03B4> <U+2192> 0.

Trying to create a general theory Denjoy used [[transfinite induction]] over the possible types of singularities which made the definition quite complicated. Other definitions were given by [[Nikolai Luzin]] (using variations on the notions of [[absolute continuity]]), and by [[Oskar Perron]], who was interested in continuous major and minor functions. It took a while to understand that the Perron and Denjoy integrals are actually identical. 

Later, in 1957, the Czech mathematician [[Jaroslav Kurzweil]] discovered a new definition of this integral elegantly similar in nature to [[Riemann]]'s original definition which he named the '''gauge integral'''; the theory was developed by [[Ralph Henstock]]. Due to these two important mathematicians, it is now commonly known as the '''Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral'''. The simplicity of Kurzweil's definition made some educators advocate that this integral should replace the Riemann integral in introductory calculus courses, but this idea has not gained traction.

==Definition==
Henstock's definition is as follows:

Given a [[tagged partition]] ''P'' of [''a'', ''b''], say 

:<math>a = u_0 < u_1 < \cdots < u_n = b, \ \ t_i \in [u_{i-1}, u_i]</math> 

and a positive function 

:<math>\delta \colon [a, b] \to (0, \infty),\,</math>

which we call a ''gauge'', we say ''P ''is <math>\delta</math>-fine if 

:<math>\forall i \ \ u_i - u_{i-1} < \delta (t_i). </math>

For a tagged partition ''P'' and a function 

:<math>f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}</math> 

we define the Riemann sum to be 

:<math> \sum_P f = \sum_{i = 1}^n (u_i - u_{i-1}) f(t_i).</math>

Given a function 

:<math>f \colon [a, b] \to \mathbb{R},</math> 

we now define a number ''I'' to be the Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral of ''f'' if for every <U+03B5>&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there exists a gauge <math>\delta</math> such that whenever ''P'' is <math>\delta</math>-fine, we have 

:<math> {\Big \vert} \sum_P f - I {\Big \vert} < \varepsilon. </math> 

If such an ''I'' exists, we say that ''f'' is Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable on [''a'', ''b''].

[[Cousin's theorem]] states that for every gauge <math>\delta</math>, such a <math>\delta</math>-fine partition ''P'' does exist, so this condition cannot be satisfied [[vacuous truth|vacuously]]. The Riemann integral can be regarded as the special case where we only allow constant gauges.

==Properties==

Let {{nowrap|''f'': [''a'', ''b''] <U+2192> '''R'''}} be any function.

If {{nowrap|''a'' < ''c'' < ''b''}}, then ''f'' is Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable on [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] if and only if it is Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable on both [''a'',&nbsp;''c''] and [''c'',&nbsp;''b''], and then

:<math>\int_a^bf(x)\,dx=\int_a^cf(x)\,dx+\int_c^bf(x)\,dx.</math>

The Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral is linear, i.e., if ''f'' and ''g'' are integrable, and <U+03B1>, <U+03B2> are reals, then <U+03B1>''f'' + <U+03B2>''g'' is integrable and

:<math>\int_a^b\alpha f(x)+\beta g(x)\,dx=\alpha\int_a^bf(x)\,dx+\beta\int_a^bg(x)\,dx.</math>

If ''f'' is Riemann or Lebesgue integrable, then it is also Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable, and the values of the integrals are the same. The important [[Hake's theorem]] states that

:<math>\int_a^bf(x)\,dx=\lim_{c\to b-}\int_a^cf(x)\,dx</math>

whenever either side of the equation exists, and symmetrically for the lower integration bound. This means that if ''f'' is "[[improper integral|improperly]] Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable", then it is properly Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable; in particular, improper Riemann or Lebesgue integrals such as

:<math>\int_0^1\frac{\sin(1/x)}x\,dx</math>

are also Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrals. This shows that there is no sense in studying an "improper Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral" with finite bounds. However, it makes sense to consider improper Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrals with infinite bounds such as

:<math>\int_a^{+\infty} f(x)\,dx := \lim_{b\to+\infty}\int_a^bf(x)\,dx.</math>

For many types of functions the Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral is no more general than Lebesgue integral. For example, if ''f'' is bounded, the following are equivalent:
*''f'' is Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable,
*''f'' is Lebesgue integrable,
*''f'' is [[measurable function|Lebesgue measurable]].
In general, every Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable function is measurable, and ''f'' is Lebesgue integrable if and only if both ''f'' and |''f''| are Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable. This means that the Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral can be thought of as a "[[absolute convergence|non-absolutely convergent]] version of Lebesgue integral". It also implies that the Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral satisfies appropriate versions of the [[monotone convergence theorem#Lebesgue monotone convergence theorem|monotone convergence theorem]] (without requiring the functions to be nonnegative) and [[dominated convergence theorem]] (where the condition of dominance is loosened to ''g''(''x'') <U+2264> ''f<sub>n</sub>''(''x'') <U+2264> ''h''(''x'') for some integrable ''g'', ''h'').

If ''F'' is differentiable everywhere (or with countable many exceptions), the derivative ''F''&prime; is Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable, and its indefinite Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral is ''F''.  (Note that ''F''&prime; need not be Lebesgue integrable.) In other words, we obtain a simpler and more satisfactory version of the [[second fundamental theorem of calculus]]: each differentiable function is, up to a constant, the integral of its derivative:

: <math>F(x) - F(a) = \int_a^x F'(t) \,dt.</math>

Conversely, the [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem]] continues to holds for the Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral: if ''f'' is Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integrable on [''a'',&nbsp;''b''], and

:<math>F(x)=\int_a^xf(t)\,dt,</math>

then ''F''&prime;(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') almost everywhere in [''a'',&nbsp;''b''] (in particular, ''F'' is almost everywhere differentiable).

==McShane integral==
Interestingly, [[Lebesgue integral]] on a line can also be presented in a similar fashion. 

First of all, change of

:<math>\forall i \ \ u_i - u_{i-1} < \delta (t_i)</math>

to

:<math>\forall i \ \ [u_{i-1},u_i]\subset U_{\delta (t_i)}(t_i)</math>

(here <math>U_{\varepsilon}(a)</math> is a <math>\varepsilon</math>-neighbourhood of ''a'') in the notion of <math>\delta</math>-fine partition yields a definition of the Henstock<U+2013>Kurzweil integral equivalent to the one given above. But after this change we can drop condition

:<math>t_i \in [u_{i-1}, u_i]</math> 

and get a definition of ''McShane integral'', which is equivalent to the Lebesgue integral.
