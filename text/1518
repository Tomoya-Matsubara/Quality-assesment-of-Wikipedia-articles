'''LeRoi Holloway Moore''' (September 7, 1961 <U+2013> August 19, 2008) was an American [[saxophonist]] best known as a founding member of the [[Dave Matthews Band]]. Moore often [[orchestration|arranged]] music for the songs written by frontman [[Dave Matthews]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://dmband.com/member/leroi/ |title=The Official Dave Matthews Band Website :: Member |accessdate=2008-08-20 |publisher=Dave Matthews Band |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080309133403/http://dmband.com/member/leroi/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> Moore also co-wrote many of the band's songs, notably "[[Too Much (Dave Matthews Band song)|Too Much]]" and "[[Stay (Wasting Time)]]".

==Biography==
Moore was born on September 7, 1961, in [[Durham, North Carolina]], to Roxie Moore (n<U+00E9>e Holloway) and Albert P. Moore.<ref name="obit">{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/DailyProgress/Obituaries.asp?Page=LifeStory&PersonId=116350026|title=Obituaries: Charlottesville Daily Progress |publisher=Media General, Inc.|accessdate=2008-08-28}}</ref> Raised in Virginia, he attended college at [[James Madison University]] studying [[tenor saxophone]], and later became an accomplished jazz musician in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], playing with artists such as [[John D'earth]] and [[Dawn Thompson]].<ref>http://members.tripod.com/~dancinnanci/leroibio.html</ref> Moore began playing professionally after a brief stay in college. Moore helped found the Charlottesville Swing Orchestra (1982), and the John D'earth Quintet. The latter played at Miller's, a Charlottesville bar, every Thursday night in the late 1980s, where Moore first met Dave Matthews in 1991.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Dave Matthews Band: Step Into the Light |last=Delancey |first=Morgan |publisher=ECW Press |year=2001 |isbn=1550224433}}</ref> In an effort to bring in some instrumental help for some songs Matthews had written, Moore began recording songs with Matthews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dmband.com/history/history/ |title=The Official Dave Matthews Band Website :: History |accessdate=2008-08-20 |publisher=Dave Matthews Band}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Moore played bass, baritone, tenor, alto, and soprano [[saxophone]]s, as well as the [[flute]], [[bass clarinet]], the wooden [[Tin whistle|penny whistle]], and the [[oboe]].  Moore's woodwind technician, David Saull, notes that Moore had "quite an extensive horn collection."

In addition to performing with the Dave Matthews Band, Moore appeared on [[Code Magenta]]'s self-titled album and [[Soko]]'s album ''[[In November Sunlight]]''.

Moore also worked as a producer with artist [[Samantha Farrell]] on her second album, Luminous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://antsmarching.org/news/2009/10/06/Samantha-Farrell---LeRoi-Moore-Produced-Album-Available-via-iTunes|title=Samantha Farrell - LeRoi Moore Produced Album Available via iTunes|first=Jake|last=Vigliotti|date=2009-10-06|accessdate=2009-10-18|publisher=AntsMarching.org}}</ref>

==Death==
{{Multiple issues|section=y|refimprove=November 2010|tone=November 2010}}
Moore was injured on June 30, 2008, in an [[all-terrain vehicle]] accident on his farm outside Charlottesville, Virginia,<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Reuters |title=Dave Matthews Band saxophonist dies |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080820/en_nm/matthewsband_moore_dc_1 |date=2008-08-19}}</ref> breaking several ribs and puncturing a lung,<ref>{{cite news|publisher=TMZ|title= Dave Matthews Band Member Dead|url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/08/19/dave-matthews-band-member-dead/}}</ref> and was hospitalized at [[University of Virginia Health System|UVA]] for several days. Moore was riding the ATV to another part of his farm to check a fence when the vehicle hit a grass-covered ditch. This caused the ATV to flip and partially land on Moore. His last live performance took place two days prior at the [[Nissan Pavilion]] in [[Bristow, Virginia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453056556&tid=98&where=2008 |title=06.28.08 Nissan Pavilion at Stone Ridge - Bristow, VA |work=DMBAlmanac.com |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> [[Jeff Coffin]], the saxophonist from [[B<U+00E9>la Fleck and the Flecktones]], stood in for Moore on subsequent tour dates. July 1, 2008, in Charlotte, North Carolina, marked the first time a band member has missed a show since 1993, two years after the band was formed.<ref>http://www.dmbalmanac.com/TourShowSet.aspx?id=453056557&tid=98&where=2008</ref>  Though released several days later, Moore was re-hospitalized in mid-July for complications related to the accident.  

After Moore was released from the University of Virginia Health System, he traveled to his home in Los Angeles, California, to start his rehabilitation program. On the morning of August 19, Moore was feeling unwell and those who were present could see that his lips were turning blue.  It was at this point that he was rushed to the hospital, but died shortly thereafter. While it was widely reported that he had died from a [[Thrombus|blood clot]], the coroner's office determined his cause of death to be [[pneumonia]]. The following statement was released on the band's website:<blockquote>
We are deeply saddened that LeRoi Moore, saxophonist and founding member of Dave Matthews Band, died unexpectedly Tuesday afternoon, August 19, 2008, at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles from sudden complications stemming from his June ATV accident on his farm near Charlottesville, Virginia. LeRoi had recently returned to his Los Angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmband.com/news/2008/8 |title=The Official Dave Matthews Band Website :: News |publisher=Dave Matthews Band|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2008-08-19}}</ref></blockquote>

Matthews paid tribute to Moore on the day of his passing at the [[Staples Center]], Los Angeles, after the band's first song of the performance, "[[Bartender (Dave Matthews Band song)|Bartender]]".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/article/10937/dave-matthews-bands-leroi-moore-passes-away/ |title=Dave Matthews Band<U+2019>s LeRoi Moore Passes Away |publisher=[[Access Hollywood]] |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2008-08-20}}</ref> "We all had some bad news today," Matthews told the sold-out crowd. "Our good friend LeRoi Moore passed on and gave his ghost up today and we will miss him forever." Fans then shouted Moore's name in remembrance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20220249,00.html |publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=2008-08-20 |date=2008-08-20 |title=Dave Matthews Pays Tribute to Band Member |author=Mary Margaret}}</ref>

On August 27, Moore was entombed at Holly Memorial Gardens in Albemarle County. Attendance at the funeral numbered in the thousands, including the rest of the band, Moore's family, and dedicated fans.

Moore died 3 months shy of his November 8, 2008 wedding to his longtime love and best friend, Lisa Beane. 

<U+201C>Roi loved people,<U+201D> said Matthews, <U+201C>but he had the hardest time loving himself, and that was the most difficult thing about being his friend for me, watching him torture himself.<U+201D>  Matthews said the 46-year-old Moore was <U+201C>a good soul, but he was a tortured soul. But he loved his family and he loved his friends. He was finding himself, finding the light inside himself, and it was shining more than it had for a very long time.<U+201D>  Matthews credited Moore<U+2019>s fiance, Lisa Bean, for his newfound happiness.  <U+201C>I believe her unwavering love for him,<U+201D> Matthews said, <U+201C>and her willingness to stand in front of him, as he was reluctant to love himself, and insisted on it, caused him to eventually see the light.  <U+201C>It was so bright,<U+201D> Matthews continued, <U+201C>that we could all see it so much all of the time, when he would put that horn in his mouth and make the most astonishingly honest music that could knock you over, and it would sink right to the middle of you.<U+201D> <ref>http://www.readthehook.com/blog/index.php/2008/08/28/tortured-shining-moore-remembered-by-dave/</ref>

Dave Matthews Band released LeRoi Moore's final concert performance as ''[[Live Trax Vol. 14]]''. The concert took place in the band's home state of Virginia in Bristow on June 28, 2008. Proceeds from the CD will be donated to local charities that Moore valued.<ref>http://www.davematthewsband.com/news/view/7f38d07b7ae4154c28f97fe27fec5669</ref>

===Reaction===
The reaction from Dave Matthews Band fans and management was tremendous after Moore's death.  Almost from the second Moore's death was known, fans started to honor LeRoi in many ways.  This included the creation of wristbands, bumper stickers, and memorial recordings honoring his accomplishments and his life.  For the final shows of Dave Matthews Band's summer tour, the band played songs that were LeRoi's favorites such as "[[Eh Hee]]," "[[Proudest Monkey]]," "[[Bartender (Dave Matthews Band song)|Bartender]]," and "[[Loving Wings]]." Other musicians and artists, such as [[John Mayer]], [[Jeff Coffin]] (who took over horn duties for Moore following his passing), [[Kenny Chesney]], [[The Allman Brothers]], [[B<U+00E9>la Fleck and the Flecktones]], [[Victor Wooten]], and [[Phish]] paid tribute to Moore on their websites and at their shows.

With the release of the band's newest studio album, ''[[Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King]]'', the band became more open to talk about Moore's death and their reaction to that day with the media. In the documentary ''[[The Road to Big Whiskey]]'', each band member talked about the day that LeRoi passed and how it has affected them.

===Tribute===
On September 30, 2008, during a concert in Brazil for the South American Tour, while the Dave Matthews Band was playing the introduction of "[[41 (song)|#41]]," Brazilian fans spread white balloons around the concert house in order to pay homage to Moore.  At this point, the band almost completely stopped playing and thanked the crowd for this amazing show of thanks to Moore.  Violinist Boyd Tinsley was driven to tears by this amazing homage to Moore.

After Moore's death, Methane Studios, the company that creates most of the band's show posters, paid tribute to Moore on the posters that were sold at the shows. One such poster that was sold at a show on September 7, 2008, which would have been Moore's 47th birthday, has become a sought after collectors item among fans. Some sales of the poster have been seen as high as $600 on eBay. 

A second tribute poster was printed and released on Sept 6, 2009, and was sold during the final day of the Gorge '09 show. The poster was the King of Spades, a part of the Royal Flush series. There were 1100 printed and all prints sold out in the first hour. It shows the King of Spades playing a saxophone with his eyes closed. Across the base of his crown, it says "GrooGrux King."

Glow sticks were also tossed by the crowd during the Gorge shows in 2008, as well as a tribute slide show video with photos of Moore, played along with the studio version of "[[34 (song)|#34]]" during the encore breaks.

At the [[51st Grammy Awards]], the first one following Moore's death, a video tribute to musicians who had died in the previous year excluded Moore, disappointing and angering fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7883319.stm |title=Fans angry over Moore Grammy snub |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2009-02-22}}</ref> [[Neil Portnow]], president of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]], responded with a statement noting that Moore was included in a list of deceased musicians in the program for the event, and "unfortunately we are unable to include all of the talented and wonderful people within the allotted timeframe." This created a tremendous outrage from the band's fans and many other music celebrities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2009/02/11/dave-matthews-band-recording-academy-president-address-leroi-moores-omission-from-grammy-in-memoriam-segment/ |title=Dave Matthews Band, Recording Academy President Address LeRoi Moore<U+2019>s Omission From Grammy <U+2018>In Memoriam<U+2019> Segment |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2009-02-22 |publisher=[[MTV]] |author=Alex Shapiro}}</ref>
