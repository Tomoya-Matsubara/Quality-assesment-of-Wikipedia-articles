'''German submarine ''U-853''''' was a [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German Type IX submarine#Type IXC/40|Type IXC/40]] [[U-boat]] of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' during [[World War II]]. Her keel was laid down on 21 August 1942 by [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]]. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 25 June 1943 with ''[[Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant]]'' Helmut Sommer in command. ''U-853'' saw action during the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939<U+2013>1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] in [[World War II]]. She conducted three patrols, sinking two ships totalling 5,783 tons. 

On her final patrol, ''U-853'' was sent to harass United States coastal shipping.  She destroyed [[USS Eagle Boat 56 (PE-56)|USS ''Eagle 56'' (PE-56)]] near [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], [[Maine]].  Just days before Germany's surrender, ''U-853'' torpedoed and sank the collier ''Black Point'' during the [[#Battle of Point Judith|Battle of Point Judith]].  American warships quickly found ''U-853'' and sank her {{convert|7|mi}} east of [[Block Island]], [[Rhode Island]], resulting in the loss of her entire crew.

''U-853'' is a popular [[deep sea diving]] site.  She rests in {{convert|121|ft}} of water.  Holes in the hull permit access to the interior of the submarine, though it is a war grave with most of the 55 crew bodies remaining inside.   

== Construction and crew==
''U-853'' was a German Type IXC/40 submarine built by [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]]. Ordered on 5 June 1941, her keel was laid on 21 August 1942 and she was commissioned on 25 June 1943.<ref name="uboatnet">{{cite web|publisher=www.uboat.net|title=U-853|url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/u853.htm|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> She was one of 87 submarines of her type.  The Type IXC/40 was a large ocean-going submarine that designed for sustained operations far from the home support facilities. ''U-853'' carried a crew of 55. The Germans nicknamed the [[U-boat]] ''der Seilt<U+00E4>nzer'' ("the Tightrope Walker"), and her crew painted an emblem of a yellow shield with a red horse on her sail.<ref>{{cite book|title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56|last=Puleo|first=Stephen|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1592287395|year=2005|pages=15<U+2013>17}}</ref>

==First patrol==
On her first patrol from May to June 1944, ''U-853'' was assigned to weather-watching duty under the command of ''Kapit<U+00E4>nleutnant'' Helmut Sommer.  This was his first war patrol.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.uboat.net|title=Helmut Sommer|url=http://www.uboat.net/men/commanders/1203.html|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> German intelligence believed that weather conditions in the Atlantic could be used to help predict the timing of an Allied invasion of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56|last=Puleo|first=Stephen|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1592287395|year=2005|page=16}}</ref> On May 25, 1944 ''U-853'' spotted the ''[[RMS Queen Mary|Queen Mary]]'', loaded with American troops and supplies.  The U-boat submerged to attack, but was outrun by the much larger and faster ship.<ref name="greatest">{{cite book|title=The Greatest Submarine Stories Ever Told|last=Underwood|first=Lamar|year=2005|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1592287336|pages=184<U+2013>185}}</ref>  As she surfaced in the ''Queen Mary's'' wake ''U-853'' was attacked by [[Fairey Swordfish]] aircraft from British [[merchant aircraft carrier]]s {{ship|MV|Ancylus}} and {{ship|MV|Empire MacKendrick}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Barque of Saviors |last=Drumm|first=Russell|year=2001|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Books|isbn=0395983673|page=9}}</ref> The U-boat took no significant damage and returned fire, hitting all three aircraft.  The planes were able to return to their carrier, but after recovery one was deemed a total loss and jettisoned.

The escort carrier {{USS|Croatan|CVE-14}} had been hunting weather boats for nearly a month and had already sunk {{GS|U-488||2}} and {{GS|U-490||2}}.  Intercepted radio transmissions led ''Croatan'' and six destroyers to search for ''U-853''.<ref name="Puleo 2005 17">{{cite book|title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56|last=Puleo|first=Stephen|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1592287395|year=2005|page=17}}</ref> The ''U-853'' proved so elusive that ''Croatan''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew nicknamed their prey "Moby Dick."<ref name="greatest"/> After ten days of hunting, on June 17 [[Huff-Duff]] (HF/DF, high frequency direction finding) picked up a weather report from the ''U-853'' only {{convert|30|mi}} away.<ref name="greatest"/>  Within minutes two [[FM-1 Wildcat]] fighters [[strafe]]d the submarine,<ref name="greatest"/> killing  2 men and wounding 12 others.  Sommer suffered 28 shrapnel and bullet wounds yet still managed to give the order to submerge.  In all likelihood Sommer saved his submarine from being destroyed by allied bombers.<ref name="greatest"/>

Three weeks of pursuit from May 25 until June 17 placed an enormous strain on ''U-853''{{'}}s crew. Twenty-three year old ''[[Oberleutnant zur See]]'' Helmut Fr<U+00F6>msdorf took command of the boat on June 18 (his first command)<ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.uboat.net|title=Helmut Fr<U+00F6>msdorf|url=http://www.uboat.net/men/commanders/332.html|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref> and returned to [[Lorient]]. Sommer and a large number of the crew was declared unfit for duty. On July 10 Sommer was formally relieved by ''Oberlutenant'' Otto Wermuth.

==Second patrol==
The boat remained in port until August 27. Decorated veteran ''[[Korvettenkapit<U+00E4>n]]'' [[G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke]], Commander of the [[10. Unterseebootsflottille|10th Flotilla]], took command for her second patrol.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=www.uboat.net|title=G<U+00FC>nter Kuhnke|url=http://www.uboat.net/men/kuhnke.htm|accessdate=2007-09-30}}</ref>  
''U-853'' operated this time in the [[Western Approaches]] off the British Isles, but in a period of seven weeks scored no successes. On completion she did not return to Lorient, but continued to [[Flensburg]], arriving October 14. 
<ref>[http://uboat.net/boats/patrols/patrol_2537.html 2nd patrol] www.uboat.net retrieved 23.9.09</ref>
Kuhnke assumed command of the [[33. Unterseebootsflottille|33rd Flotilla]] upon arriving at Flensburg.  He relinquished command of ''U-853'' back to Fr<U+00F6>msdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure ''U-853'' was fitted with a ''[[Submarine snorkel|Schnorchel]]'', a retractable air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines.<ref name="greatest"/> The ''Schnorchel'' reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.<ref name="greatest"/>

==Last patrol==
On February 23, 1945 Germany sent ''U-853'' on her third war patrol to harass US coastal shipping.  Under the command of ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Helmut Fr<U+00F6>msdorf, ''U-853'' did not sink any targets during the first weeks of her patrol.  Her crossing of the Atlantic was slow because she used her ''Schnorchel'' to remain submerged to avoid being spotted by Allied aircraft.<ref name="Puleo 2005 17"/>   On April 1, 1945 ''U-853'' was ordered to the [[Gulf of Maine]].<ref name="nedn2">{{cite web|publisher=www.nedivenews.com|url=http://www.nedivenews.com/?q=node/32/print|author=Peter Venoutsos|title=U-853 Closes a Chapter of World War II|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref>  On April 23 she fatally torpedoed [[USS Eagle Boat 56 (PE-56)|USS ''Eagle Boat 56'' (PE-56)]] near [[Portland, Maine]].<ref name="uscg">{{cite web|title=U-853|publisher=www.uscg.mil|accessdate=2008-09-29|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/U853.asp}}</ref> The next day [[USS Muskegon (PF-24)|USS ''Muskegon'' (PF-24)]] made [[sonar]] contact and attacked ''U-853'', but failed to destroy her.<ref name="nedn2"/>

''Eagle Boat 56'', a [[World War I]]-era patrol boat, was towing targets for a [[United States Navy]] dive-bomber training exercise {{convert|3|mi}} off [[Cape Elizabeth, Maine|Cape Elizabeth]] when she exploded amidships and sank.  Only 13 of the 67 crew survived.  Although several survivors claimed to have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion.  The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 to acknowledge that the sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded [[Purple Heart]]s to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.<ref>{{cite book|title=Due to Enemy Action: The True World War II Story of the USS Eagle 56|last=Puleo|first=Stephen|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=1592287395|year=2005|page=5}}</ref>

== Battle of Point Judith ==

[[Image:U-853-sinking2.jpg|thumbnail|left|Hedgehog charges detonate on the ocean floor]]

On May 5, 1945, [[President of Germany|President]] (''[[Reichspr<U+00E4>sident]]'') of [[Nazi Germany]] [[Karl D<U+00F6>nitz]] ordered all U-boats to cease offensive operations and return to their bases. ''U-853'' was lying in wait off [[Point Judith, Rhode Island]] at the time.  According to the [[US Coast Guard]], ''U-853'' did not receive that order, or less likely, ignored it.<ref name="uscg"/>  Soon after, her torpedo blew off the stern of SS ''Black Point'', a {{convert|368|ft|adj=on}} [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] underway from [[New York City, New York|New York]] to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Within 15 minutes ''Black Point'' had sunk in {{convert|100|ft}} of water less than {{convert|4|mi}} south of Point Judith.<ref name="nedn">{{cite web|publisher=www.nedivenews.com|url=http://www.nedivenews.com/?q=node/180|title=U-853|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref>  She was the last US-flagged merchant ship lost in [[World War II]]. Twelve men died, while 34 crew members were rescued. One of the rescuing ships, Yugoslav freighter SS ''Kamen'', sent a report of the torpedoing to authorities.  The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] organized a "hunter-killer" group that included four American warships: {{USS|Ericsson|DD-440|3}}, {{USS|Amick|DE-168|3}}, {{USS|Atherton |DE-169|3}}, and {{USS|Moberly|PF-63|3}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=U-853|url=http://www.uscg.mil/History/WEBCUTTERS/PF63_Moberly.html|publisher=uscg.mil|accessdate=2007-07-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The group discovered ''U-853'' bottomed in {{convert|18|fathom}}, and dropped [[depth charge]]s and [[hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]]s during a 16 hour attack.  At first the U-boat attempted to flee, and then tried to hide by lying still.  Both times it was found by sonar.<ref name="BI">{{cite book | title=Block Island&mdash;The Sea | author=Robert M. Downie | publisher= Book Nook Press | year= 1998|pages=197<U+2013>198}}</ref> The morning of May 6, 1945 two [[K-Class blimp]]s from [[Lakehurst, New Jersey|Lakehurst]], [[New Jersey]], K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers.  K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from ''Atherton'' and ''Moberly'' resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap floating to the surface.  With the loss of all 55 officers and men, ''U-853'' was one of the last U-boat sunk during [[World War II]].<ref name="BI" /> and, with [[German submarine U-881|''U-881'']], the last to be sunk in US waters. ''Atherton'' and ''Moberly'' received credit for the kill.<ref name="uboatnet"/>

== Wreck ==
''U-853'' lies seven miles east of [[Block Island]] in {{convert|130|ft}} of water. The US Coast Guard pinpoints the location of the wreck at 41.13 N 71.27 W.<ref name="uscg"/> ''U-853'' sits upright with her periscope rising to a depth of {{convert|100|ft}}.<ref name="nedn"/> Most of the 55 crew member bodies remain within the hull, which is a war grave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/fates/dive/dive_us.htm|title=Dive into History US Waters|publisher=www.uboat.net|accessdate=2008-09-30}}</ref> It is one of the more popular dive sites in Southern New England. The hull has depth charge blast holes: one forward of the conning tower at the radio room and another in the starboard side of the engine room. Entering the wreck is dangerous due to debris, sharp metal edges, and confined spaces.<ref name="nedn2"/>  

On May 6 and 7, 1945, Navy divers attempted to enter the wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed.<ref name="nedn"/>  Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953.  In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck.  This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].<ref name="nedn2"/> At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage.<ref>{{cite book | title=Block Island&mdash;The Sea | author=Robert M.
