The body existed from 1775 to 1845. In the history of the Polish parliament, it succeeded the [[general sejm]] and local [[sejmik]] on the territories of the [[Austrian partition]]. The Estates were disbanded following the [[Krak<U+00F3>w Uprising]] of 1846. In 1861 they was succeeded by the [[Country Sejm]] ({{lang-pl|sejm krajowy}}).

==History==
===Postulate Sejm===
Parts of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Lesser Poland]] territories were included in the [[Austrian partition]] as early as the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/> In order to reduce the dissent, the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1775 allowed the Polish nobility ([[szlachta]]) of the newly acquired territories to continue their tradition of holding a local parliament-like meetings, and gave the permission for an advisory body, the '''Postulate Sejm''' ({{lang-pl|sejm postulatowy}}), to be held every year.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/><ref name="Smole<U+0144>ski1919">{{cite book|author=W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Smole<U+0144>ski|title=Dzieje narodu polskiego|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=DUpBAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA408|accessdate=31 October 2012|year=1919|publisher=Gebethner i Wolff|pages=408<U+2013>409}}</ref> The implementation of the Postulate Sejm was delayed, and eventually it held only four sessions, all in [[Lviv]] (Lw<U+00F3>w): in 1782, 1784, 1786 and 1788.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/> The body had no real power; it could only write petitions to the monarch, who had no obligation to act on them.<ref name="Smole<U+0144>ski1919"/> Polish legal scholar [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Grodziski]] noted that while the Sejm, on the surface, continued the Polish parliamentary tradtion, the real goal of this powerless body, as intended by the Austrian court, was to drive a wedge between the various groups of Polish nobility, reducing their unity and influence.<ref name="Grodziski1993">{{cite book|author=Stanis<U+0142>aw Grodziski|title=Sejm Krajowy galicyjski: 1861-1914|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VDZpAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=1 November 2012|year=1993|publisher=Wydawn. Sejmowe|isbn=978-83-7059-052-9|page=17}}</ref> The Postulate Sejm was composed of wealthy nobility and two deputies from the city of Lviv.<ref name="Smole<U+0144>ski1919"/> The sessions lasted few days each.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/> The 1788 session was the last one; part of the Austrian-held Commonwealth territories were briefly included in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] following the [[Polish-Austrian War]] in 1806, and the populace represented at the [[Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw]], but this was short lived, as the territories in question were restored to Austria following the Duchy's occupation and the terms of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/>

===Estates of Galicia===
Soon afterward, in 1817, [[Francis I of Austria]] called for a new sejm, now named the [[Estates of Galicia]] ({{lang-pl|Stany Galicyjskie}}), which met again in Lviv.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/> Most scholars, like [[Jacek J<U+0119>druch]], see this body as a continuation of the Postulate Sejm, and discuss both of them together.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/> The [[Austrian Emperor]] decreed that the members have to wear a special uniform; this made it the only Polish parliament-like body in the history of Polish politics with a [[dress code]] requirement.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-242"/>

The Estates were mostly conservative, however from late 1830s influx of new members, such as [[Leon Sapieha]], [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Badeni]] and [[Agenor Go<U+0142>uchowski]] made the body more progressive and representative.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-243"/> In the 1840s the Sejm saw much debate on the subject of [[abolition of serfdom]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-244"/> The Estates last met in 1845, when they voted, 116 to 10, on the proposal to abolish serfdom; however they lacked the power to implement it and had to wait for the Emperor's decision.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-245"/> The Estates were disbanded following the [[Krak<U+00F3>w Uprising]] of 1846, a mostly [[peasant rebellion]] aimed, ironically, at many of the nobles who were supportive of the abolition of serfdom.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-243"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-245"/> In 1848, during the [[Spring of Nations]] unrest, when the Emperor tried to convene the Estates, the members refused, demanding a more representative composition, and increased powers; the Emperor turned down their demand.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-245"/> In 1861 thee Estates were succeeded by the [[Country Sejm]] ({{lang-pl|sejm krajowy}}).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-246"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-247"/>

==Composition and organization==
The number of the members was not fixed; it varied from over 200 (in 1782 and 1817( to as low as 41 (in 1834); in most years the Sejm had averaged 60 to 80 deputies.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-243"/> They were composed of clergy, nobility (either titled or above a certain, relatively high, income level), two deputies from the city of Lviv representing the [[burger]]s and later, [[chancellor]] of the [[University of Lw<U+00F3>w]].<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-241"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-242"/> The members were not elective, holding the mandates due to their offices, titles or wealth.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-242"/> This made the Sejm not representative, and rather conservative.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-242"/>

The Estates met for a few days each year, with some exceptions: they were not convened in the years 1831 and 1832 (time of the [[November Uprising]] in the neighboring Polish statelet, the [[Congress Kingdom]]).<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-242"/><ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-243"/>

The Estates had no dedicated location to meet.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-246"/> To evade Emperor's limitation on the preceedings duration and topics to be discussed, the members met before each session at various locations.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-247"/> While in session, they met at the former monastery buildings, owned by the University of Lw<U+00F3>w.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-247"/>

==Competences==
Just like the preceeding Postulate Sejm, the Estates had very limited competences: they met to hear the Emperor decrees, distribute tax assessments, grant Galician titles of nobility to individuals who already held similar titles elsewhere in the Austrian Empire, prepare petitions and appeals to be heard by the Emperor.<ref name="J<U+0119>druch1982-242"/> Polish 19th century historian, [[Henryk Schmitt]], wrote that the role of the Estates was to listen to the government decisions, and file petitions, which often waited for the royal reply for several years; he thus notes that the Estates were powerless, a "comedy", their only purpose being to fulfill the Congress of Vienna requirement of having some form of "national representation" on the lands of the Austrian partition.<ref name="Schmitt1894">{{cite book|author=Henryk Schmitt|title=Dzieje porozbiorowe Polski|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gFZCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA340|accessdate=31 October 2012|year=1894|publisher=Nak<U+0142>adem Towarzystwa <U+00F3>swiaty ludowej|page=340}}</ref>
