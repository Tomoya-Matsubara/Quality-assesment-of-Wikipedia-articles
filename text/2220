The '''2008 congressional elections in Kansas''' were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who would represent the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Kansas]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]], coinciding with the [[United States presidential election, 2008|presidential]] and [[United States Senate election in Kansas, 2008|senatorial]] elections. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected will serve in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]] from January 3, 2009 until January 3, 2011.

Kansas has four seats in the House, apportioned according to the [[2000 United States Census]]. Its 2007-2008 congressional delegation consisted of two Republicans and two Democrats. It is now three Republicans and one Democrat. District 2 was the only seat which changed party (from Democratic to Republican), although CQ Politics had forecasted districts 2 and 3 to be at some risk for the incumbent party.

The primary elections for Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates were held on August 5.<ref>[http://www.kssos.org/elections/08elec/2008%20Election%20Calendar.pdf 2008 Election Calendar] ''Kansas Secretary of State'''</ref>
