'''Mellbreak''' is a [[hill]] in the Western part of the [[England|English]] [[Lake District]]. Despite being surrounded on all sides by higher fells (the [[Loweswater]] Fells, the [[High Stile]] Ridge and the [[Grasmoor]] Group), it stands in isolation. It is surrounded on three sides by a '[[moat]]' of deep marshy land, and on the fourth (east) side by the [[lake]] of [[Crummock Water]]. The fell forms a partnership with the lake, running parallel to it, falling sheer into it, and regularly providing the backdrop for pictures of it.

==Topography==
The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and [[Wasdale]] to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are [[Great Gable]] and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of [[Ennerdale]], the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.<ref name="wainwright">[[Alfred Wainwright]]: ''A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells'': Westmorland Gazette (1966): ISBN 0-7112-2460-9</ref> Mellbreak and the other Loweswater Fells form the extremity of the northern arm.

The Loweswater Fells have been compared<ref name="wainwright"/> to the digits of a hand, radiating out south westward from the "palm" centred on Loweswater village. From the west these are [[Burnbank Fell]], [[Blake Fell]], [[Gavel Fell]], [[Hen Comb]] and Mellbreak, the "thumb". To continue the hand metaphor, the opposing thumb of Mellbreak is the tenuous northern extremity of [[Starling Dodd]], whilst the other Loweswater Fells are satellites of [[Great Borne]].

The fell has been likened (by [[Alfred Wainwright]] and others) to the shape of an upturned boat, having north and south tops of roughly equal height and a wide flat depression in between. On the eastern side the steep slopes run down directly to the shore of Crummock Water. Low Ling Crag, a rocky projection into the lake, is a continuation of outcrops higher up. Other crags rim the depression between the two tops. 

The southern boundary is formed by Scale Beck and its tributary Black Beck. Mellbreak has a third much lower top overlooking this steep sided valley, Scale Kott (1,109&nbsp;ft). At the head of Black Beck is the connection to Starling Dodd, running south west from Scale Knott. This could hardly be considered a ridge in walking terms, since it begins at the foot of an 800&nbsp;ft scree slope on the northern flank of Starling Dodd.

To the west of Mellbreak is the marshy valley of Mosedale, its beck flowing north to Loweswater village. On the other side is the parallel ridge of Hen Comb. The northern end of Mellbreak rises direct from the valley behind the village, precipitous like a sand castle on a flat beach. From this vantage point its steep [[gable]]d profile is an arresting sight. The successive rock tiers of White, Dropping and Raven Crags complete the picture.

==Geology and Mining==
Mellbreak is formed primarily from the laminated [[mudstone]] and [[siltstone]] of the Kirkstile Formation. There is an intrusion of [[basalt]] on the Crummock face and the southern end around Scale Knott exhibit the Buttermere Formation. This is an [[olistostrome]] of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and [[sandstone]].The rocks of Hen Comb are of the Kirkstile Formation, laminated [[mudstone]] and [[siltstone]], often associated with the [[Skiddaw]] group.<ref name="BGS">[[British Geological Survey]]: 1:50,000 series maps, ''England & Wales Sheet 29'': BGS (1999)</ref>

There are two small trials for [[iron]], one on each side of the fell. Neither penetrates for more than a few feet.<ref name="adams">Adams, John: ''Mines of the Lake District Fells'': Dalesman (1995) ISBN 0-85206-931-6</ref>

==Summit and View==
Although the south top is slightly higher, at 512&nbsp;m (1,680&nbsp;ft) it is the north top (509&nbsp;m, 1,670&nbsp;ft) that is the better summit, being rocky and situated on the top of the crags that make up the north face of the fell. Both carry substantial [cairn]]s, that of the true summit being on grass. <ref name="wainwright"/> The views are good from both summits, a consequence of Mellbreak's isolation and great [[Topographic prominence|relative height]]. The north top brings the [[Solway Firth]] into view, but otherwise the differences are mainly confined to the foreground. [[Grasmoor]] and [[Rannerdale Knotts]] look impressive across the lake, an unexpected glimpse of the [[Helvellyn range]] seen behind.<ref name="wainwright"/>


==Ascents==
A popular route up the fell is a path from the village of [[Loweswater]], that threads its way between the [[crags]] and rocky outcrops on the north side. The north top is then traversed to reach the summit. A variation misses out the north top, following a slanting path southwards along the Mosedale face to the depression. From the shore of Crummock Water an ascent can be made following Pillar Rake, a diagonal breach in the central rim of crag. A direct climb of the south top direct is best achieved from Buttermere village, starting along the Scale Force path before making for Scale Knott.<ref name="wainwright"/><ref name="birkett"> Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): ISBN 0-00-713629-3</ref>
