'''Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen''' (5 May 1833 &ndash; 6 October 1905) was a [[Germany|German]] traveller, [[geographer]], and [[scientist]]. 

==Biography==
He was born in [[Pok<U+00F3>j|Carlsruhe]], [[Prussian Silesia]], and was educated in [[University of Wroc<U+0142>aw|Breslau]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]]. He traveled or studied in the [[Alps]] of [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]] and the [[Carpathians]] in [[Transylvania]]. In 1860, he joined the [[Eulenburg Expedition]], a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] expedition which visited [[Ceylon]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Java (island)|Java]], the [[Philippines]], [[Siam]], [[Burma]] between 1860 and 1862. From 1862 to 1868 he worked as a geologist in the [[United States]] discovering [[Goldfield]]s in [[California]]. This was followed by several more trips of [[Qing Dynasty|China]], [[Japan]], [[Burma]], and [[Java]]. He published his geographical, geological, economic, and ethnological findings in three volumes with an atlas. In China he located the dried-up lake bed of [[Lopnur]]. 

He was also Professor of [[Geology]] at the [[University of Bonn]] beginning in 1875, Professor of [[Geography]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1883, and Professor of Geography at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin]] in 1886. Among his most famous students was [[Sven Hedin]], the Swedish explorer. He served as President of the German Geographical Society for many years, and founded the Berlin Hydrographical Institute.

He is noted for coining the terms "Seidenstra<U+00DF>e" and "Seidenstra<U+00DF>en" = "[[Silk Road]](s)" or "Silk Route(s)" in 1877.<ref>"Approaches Old and New to the Silk Roads" Vadime Eliseeff in: ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce''.

"Richtofen's "Silk Roads": Toward the Archaeology of a Concept." ''The Silk Road''. Volume 5, Number 1, Summer 2007, p. 4.</ref> He also standardized the practices of [[chorography]] and [[chorology]].

He died in 1905 in Berlin.

When [[William Gill (explorer)|William Gill]] consulted him about a planned trip to China, he remarked:
{{cquote|Hour after hour he gave up his valuable time to me, and opened volumes from his rich store of information. <U+2026> Baron von Richtofen possesses in a remarkable manner the faculty of gathering up the details presented to his view; putting them together and generalising on them with rare judgement; forming out of what would be to a lesser genius, but scattered and unintelligible fragments, a uniform and comprehensive whole <U+2026> not one hint was given me that did not subsequently prove its value; his kind thoughts for my comfort and amusement were never ceasing, and his refined and cultivated intellect and genial manner rendered the recollections of my stay in the German capital some of the most pleasant of my life.}}

Ferdinand von Richthofen was an uncle of the [[World War I]] flying ace [[Manfred von Richthofen]], best known as the "[[Red Baron]]".

The mountain range on the southern edge of the [[Gansu corridor]] in western China was named [[Richthofen Range]] after him, although the modern name is now [[Qilian Mountains]].  The 12940 ft. [[Mount Richthofen]] in [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] is also named after him.<ref>{{cite book | url =  http://books.google.de/books?id=RqIJGW5OoaIC&pg=PA50 | isbn = 9780967146607 | author =  edited by Randy Jacobs, with Robert M.
