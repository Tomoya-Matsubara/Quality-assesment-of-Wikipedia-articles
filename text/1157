The '''Marquette Building''', completed in 1895, is a [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] landmark that was built by the George A. Fuller Company and designed by architects [[Holabird & Roche]].  The building is currently owned by the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]].  It is located in the [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] known as the "[[Loop, Chicago|Loop]]" in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]].

The building was one of the early steel frame [[skyscraper]]s of its day, and is considered one of the best examples of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School of architecture]].<ref name=NPS>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/chicago/c11.htm|accessdate=2009-05-28|title=The Marquette Building|publisher=National Park Service|author=|date=}}</ref> The building originally had a reddish, [[terra cotta]] exterior that is now somewhat blackened due to decades of Loop soot.  It is noted both for its then cutting edge frame and its ornate interior.  

Since being built, the building has received numerous awards and honors.  It was designated a [[Chicago Landmark]] on June 9, 1975,<ref name="CoC">{{cite web |author= |url= http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/M/Marquette.html |title= Marquette Building |publisher= City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division |year= 2003 |month= |accessdate=2007-02-05 }}</ref> and it is considered an architectural masterpiece. It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on August 17, 1973.  It was a named a [[National Historic Landmark]] on January 7, 1976.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url= http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=1328&resourceType=Building |title= Marquette Building |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2007-03-26 }}</ref>  The building's preservation has been a major focus of the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation completed an extensive four-year restoration in 2006.

==History==
The building was named after Father [[Jacques Marquette]], the first European settler in Chicago, who explored the Chicago region in 1674 and wintered in the area for the 1674-5 winter season.  It was designed by  [[William Holabird]] and [[Martin Roche]], with Coydon T. Purdy, [[architect]]s of the firm [[Holabird & Roche]].<ref name="Ab">{{cite web |author= Craven, Jackie |url= http://architecture.about.com/library/blmarquette-holabird.htm |title= Great Buildings |publisher= About, Inc., |year= |month= |accessdate=2007-02-05 }}</ref>

In the 1930s the building was the downtown [[headquarters]] for over 30 [[railroad]] companies.<ref name="Emp"/>  Its lobby connects with the [[D.H. Burnham & Company]] designed Edison Building to the west providing a [[pedway]] from Dearborn to Clark.<ref name="Emp">{{cite web |author= |url= http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=marquettebuilding-chicago-il-usa |title= Marquette Building |publisher= Emporis.com |year= |month= |accessdate=2007-02-05 }}</ref>  Around 1950, the terra-cotta cornice was removed from the Marquette Building when an additional story was added.<ref name=CL2006PEA>{{cite web|url=http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/marquette.pdf|title=2006 Preservation Excellence Awards: The Marquette Building 140 South Dearborn Street Exterior Restoration and Cornice Reconstruction|publisher=City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Landmarks Division|accessdate=2007-04-24|date=2006-09-07|format=PDF}}</ref> The building has been in continuous use as an [[office building]] since its construction.<ref name="NPS" />

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], many downtown buildings closed to the public, which eliminated warm, dry, indoor walking routes providing shortcuts through full [[city block]]s, but the Marquette Building did not.<ref name=CB20050207>{{cite news|url=http://chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/mag/article.pl?article_id=23047&bt=Marquette+Building&arc=n&searchType=all|format=Registration required|date=2005-02-07|accessdate=2007-04-30|author=Scheffler, Mark|title=Seen & Noted: Walk this way|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.|work=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref>
