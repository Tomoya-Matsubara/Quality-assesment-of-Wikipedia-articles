'''''Moon.''''' is a Japanese [[Eroge|adult]] [[visual novel]] developed by [[Tactics (company)|Tactics]], a brand of [[Nexton]], released on November 21, 1997 playable on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[Personal computer|PCs]]. The game was described by the development team as a {{Nihongo|"Reaching the Heart [[Adventure game|AVG]]"|<U+5FC3><U+306B><U+5C4A><U+304F>AVG|Kokoro ni Todoku AVG}}.<ref name="original-website">{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723212403/http://sv.force-x.com/~tactics/qtactics/moon.htm|url= http://sv.force-x.com/~tactics/qtactics/moon.htm|title=Original ''Moon.'' official website|publisher=[[Tactics (company)|Tactics]]|archivedate=July 23, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2007|language=Japanese}}</ref> The story follows the protagonist Ikumi Amasawa, a girl who joins an organization called FARGO in the hopes of discovering why and how her mother died, who was a member of the same group. The [[gameplay]] in ''Moon.'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the three female main characters. The game ranked twice in the national top 50 for best-selling PC games sold in Japan.

Much of the staff that created the game later became the founding members of the visual novel brand [[Key (company)|Key]]. ''Moon.'' was the starting point for Key's origins, and was the first time the principal Key team was formed. A novel based on the game written by [[Midori Tateyama]] was released in July 1998 by [[Movic]]. The game's original soundtrack was released bundled with ''[[D<U+014D>sei]]'''s soundtrack in August 2000 at [[Comiket|Comiket 58]]; ''D<U+014D>sei'' was Tactics' first game. ''Moon.'' has been referenced in other media not directly related to the game, such as in Tactics' third game ''[[One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e]]'', and in the second [[anime]] adaptation of Key's first game ''[[Kanon]]''.<ref name="Moon.-in-One" /><ref name="Moon.-in-Kanon" />

==Gameplay==
[[File:Moon. original screenshot.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Average dialogue and narrative in ''Moon.'' depicting the main character Ikumi talking to Haruka.]]
''Moon.'' is a [[drama]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[visual novel]] in which the player assumes the role of Ikumi Amasawa. Much of its [[gameplay]] is spent on reading the story's [[narrative]] and [[dialogue]]. ''Moon.'' follows a [[Nonlinear gameplay#Branching storylines|branching plot line]] with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

There are three main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. The player has to manually navigate through the corridors of FARGO to explore the surroundings.

The game is split into 20 sub-parts each given a title in English written mostly in white where a portion of the title is displayed in red, and each cover a single day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~tp6a-sk/moon-cap0.html|title=Outline of the 20 sub-parts in ''Moon.''|publisher=Asahi Net|accessdate=November 28, 2007|language=Japanese}}</ref> There are seven endings to the game: a single true end, two normal ends, and four bad ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~tp6a-sk/moon-cap.html|title=Outline of the seven endings in ''Moon.''|publisher=Asahi Net|accessdate=November 28, 2007|language=Japanese}}</ref> In the original game, a [[Omake|bonus]] [[role-playing game]] became available on the title screen after the game was completed at least once. This was later removed from the full-voice DVD edition of the game. There are scenes in ''Moon.'' with sexual [[Computer graphics|CGs]] depicting a given heroine having sex.

==Plot and characters==
''Moon.'''s story revolves around a mysterious organization known as FARGO. The protagonist of the story is a young girl named {{Nihongo|Ikumi Amasawa|<U+5929><U+6CA2><U+90C1><U+672A>|Amasawa Ikumi|''voiced by:'' Ruru}} who discovers that FARGO was involved with the death of her mother {{Nihongo|Miyoko Amasawa|<U+5929><U+6CA2><U+672A><U+591C><U+5B50>|Amasawa Miyoko}} six years before the story begins.<ref name="original-website" /> Miyoko, who would often make special cream stew for her daughter, was a member of FARGO. Following this revelation, Ikumi joins FARGO to discover how and why her mother died while also slowly uncovering the group's disturbing nature of harnessing psychic abilities through torture.<ref name="Moon.DVD">{{cite web|url=http://nexton-net.jp/~nexton/moon/index.html|title=Moon.DVD's official website|publisher=[[Nexton]]|accessdate=November 28, 2007|language=Japanese}}</ref> Ikumi ultimately wants to take out her revenge against FARGO for killing her mother.<ref name="original-website" />

Ikumi had been one of ten girls her age that gathered at a seminar for people who wanted to join FARGO; she had been ordered to get on a truck which would take the small group to FARGO, and on the ride, Ikumi meets two other girls with similar goals in mind as her.<ref name="original-website" /> One of the girls is named {{Nihongo|Haruka Mima|<U+5DF3><U+9593><U+6674><U+9999>|Mima Haruka|''voiced by:'' Aya}} who joined FARGO in order to save her older brother. She starts to work with Ikumi for the sake of their mutual goals.<ref name="Moon.DVD" /> The second girl is named {{Nihongo|Yui Nakura|<U+540D><U+5009><U+7531><U+4F9D>|Nakura Yui|''voiced by:'' [[Miya Serizono]]}} who is searching for her older sister {{Nihongo|Yuri Nakura|<U+540D><U+5009><U+53CB><U+91CC>|Nakura Yuri|''voiced by:'' Komugi Nishida}} who joined FARGO in order to obtain the 'invisible power', a kind of [[extrasensory perception]]. Yui has an optimistic personality which hides a gloomy past of which she has no memory of. Each of the girls have a strong will to complete their respective purposes, and they help each other along the way.<ref name="Moon.DVD" />

At FARGO, Ikumi meets others who are affiliated with the group.

''Boy'' or ''Young man'', ''voiced by:'' [[Arashi Tsunami]]}}.<ref name="Moon.DVD" /> He helps Ikumi in her search for the answers regarding her mother; it is never revealed what his true name is. Others include {{Nihongo|Takatsuki|<U+9AD8><U+69FB>||''voiced by:'' Matsuri Y<U+016B>atono}}, a man in FARGO with an arrogant attitude, and {{Nihongo|Tsuki|<U+6708>||lit.
