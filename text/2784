'''Radbod''' or '''Redbad''' (d.[[719]]) was the [[Rulers of Frisia|duke (or king) of Frisia]] from [[680]] to [[719]]. He is often considered the last independent ruler of [[Frisia]] (or [[Friesland]]) before [[Frankish]] domination.

==Reign==
While his father, Duke [[Aldegisel, King of the Frisians|Aldegisel]] (or ''Eadgils'', ''Aldgisl'' which can be translated as 'Old Whip'), had welcomed [[Christianity]] into his realm, Radbod attempted to extirpate the religion and free the Frisians from subjugation to the [[Merovingian]] kingdom of the Franks. In [[689]], Radbod was, however, defeated by [[Pippin of Herstal]] in the battle of [[Dorestad]] and compelled to cede [[West Frisia (historical)|West Frisia]] (''Frisia Citerior'', meaning Nearer Frisia, from the [[Scheldt]] to the [[Vlie]]) to the [[Franks]]. 

Between [[690]] and [[692]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] fell into the hands of [[Pippin of Herstal]]. This gave the Franks control of important trade routes on the [[Rhine]] to the [[North Sea]]. Some sources say that, following this defeat, Radbod retreated, in [[697]], to the island of [[Heligoland]], others say he retreated to the part of Holland that is still known as Friesland.

On Pippin's death in [[714]], Radbod took the initiative again. He forced [[Saint Willibrord]] and his monks to flee and advanced as far as [[Cologne]], where he defeated [[Charles Martel]], Pippin's natural son, in [[716]]. Eventually, however, Charles prevailed and compelled the Frisians to submit. Radbod died in 719, but for some years his successors struggled against the Frankish power.

==Relation with the Church==
During the second journey of [[Saint Boniface]] to [[Rome]], [[Willibrord]] tried to convert Radbod, but not succeeding he returned to Fontenelle. It is said that Radbod was nearly baptised, but refused when he was told that he would not be able to find any of his ancestors in Heaven after his death, since he preferred spending eternity in Hell with his pagan ancestors than in Heaven with strangers. This legend is also told with Willibrord being replaced with [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] (or Vulfran), a monk and ex-archbishop of [[Sens]].

Willibrord tried this while on a [[Carolingian]]-sponsored mission into Frisia with the express purpose of trying to convert the pagan [[Frisians]] living there in the hope that, once they had converted to [[Christianity]], the Franks could gain control of the important trade port [[Dorestad]], which they had up to that point been unable to do.
