'''Monemvassia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03BC><U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03B1>, <U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03BC><U+03B2><U+03AC><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03B1>, <U+039C><U+03BF><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03BC><U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C3><U+03B9><U+03AC>), is a [[medieval]] fortress with an adjacent town, located on a small peninsula off the east coast of the [[Peloponnese]] in the [[Greece|Greek]] [[Prefectures of Greece|prefecture]] of [[Laconia]]. Remains include the defensive structures, the small adjacent town and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[churches]]. Its name derives from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words, ''mone'' and ''emvassia'', meaning "single entrance". Many of the streets are narrow and are only fit for pedestrians. The bay of [[Palaia Monemvassia]] is found in the north. Monemvassia's nickname is ''the [[Gibraltar]] of the East'' or ''The Rock''.

The rock is 300 m tall and 1.8 km long. The village is situated on the southeastern side of the rock, which overlooks the Palaia Monemvasia bay. A small hamlet with about 10 houses lies to the northwest. A field of grass covers the northwest and top, accessed by a rocky, zig-zagging pathway. The fortress lies on the north side of the colorful rock, which ranges from grey to peach melon and pink.

From 1981 to 1991, the village had a huge decline in population, one of the places that lost population in Laconia.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The founding of the town and fortress of Monemvassia most probably occurred in the [[6th Century]] [[Common Era|CE]]. The town was founded in [[583]] by people seeking refuge from the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and the [[Eurasian Avars|Avaric]] invasion of Greece. From the [[10th Century]] CE, the town developed into an important trade and maritime center. The fortress withstood the [[Arab]] and [[Normans|Norman]] invasions and conquests in [[1147]]. Cornfields that fed up to 30 men were grown inside the fortress.

It was a Byzantine town that existed continuously under the domain of the Empire until [[1471]], when it was sold to the Pope by the Despot of Morea Thomas Palaeologos (in 1474 Venice captured it.) It was successively governed by [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in intervals:
*Venetian: (1470 - 1540)
*Ottoman: (1540 - 1690)
*Venetian: (1690 - 1715)
*Ottoman: (1715 - 1821)

The commercial importance of the town continued until the [[Orlov Revolt]] ([[1770]]) in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|Russo-Turkish War]], which saw its importance decline severely.

===Modern times===
The town was liberated from Ottoman rule on August 1, [[1821]], during the [[Greek War of Independence]]. 

The citadel has been uninhabited since [[1920]].

In [[1971]], Monemvassia became linked with the rest of the outside world through a bridge on the western side that connects to [[Greece Interstate 86|GR-86]].

In more recent history, the town has seen a resurgence in importance with increasing numbers of tourists visiting the site and the region. The medieval buildings have been restored, many of them converted to hotels.
