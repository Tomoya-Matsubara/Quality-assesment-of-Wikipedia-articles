The '''Sinsinawa Mound raid''' occurred on June 29, 1832, near the [[Sinsinawa, Wisconsin|Sinsinawa]] mining settlement in [[Michigan Territory]] (present-day [[Grant County, Wisconsin]] in the United States). This incident, part of the [[Black Hawk War]], resulted in the deaths of two men; a third man survived by seeking cover in a nearby [[blockhouse]]. In the aftermath of the raid, Captain [[James W. Stephenson]] set out to pursue the attackers&mdash;a straggling band of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]&mdash;but lost their trail at the [[Mississippi River]]. The attack occurred in the same week as other skirmishes and raids, and as a result helped contribute to the growing fear in the region. The raid caused the residents of nearby [[Platteville, Wisconsin|Platteville]] to consider fleeing their settlement.

==Background==
As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the [[governor]] of [[Indiana Territory]] and a group of [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and [[Fox (tribe)|Fox]] leaders regarding land settlement, the tribes vacated their lands in [[Illinois]] and moved west of the [[Mississippi]] in 1828. However, Sauk Chief [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]] and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands.<ref name=lewis/> Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830&ndash;31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River into Illinois, but was persuaded each time to return west without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the [[United Kingdom|British]], he again moved his so-called "[[British Band]]" of around 1,000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.<ref name=lewis>Lewis, James.

The conflict became known as the [[Black Hawk War]].

The period between Stillman's Run and the raid at Sinsinawa Mound was filled with war-related activity. A series of attacks at [[Buffalo Grove, Ogle County, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]], the [[Savanna, Illinois|Plum River settlement]], [[Blue Mounds Fort|Fort Blue Mounds]] and the war's most famous incident, the [[Indian Creek massacre]], all took place between mid-May and late June 1832.<ref name=indcr>"[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/diary/002816.asp May 21, Indian Creek, Ill.: Abduction of the Hall Sisters]," Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, ''Wisconsin State Historical Society''.

[[George W. Jones]], who would later become a [[U.S. Senator]] from [[Iowa]], arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 established a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own [[log cabin]], built during the spring of 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] (14.9 [[meter|m]]) by 17&nbsp;feet (5.2&nbsp;m) and each room had one door and one window.<ref name=sharp>Sharp, Mildred J.

==Aftermath==
When news of the raid reached [[Galena, Illinois]], Captain [[James W. Stephenson]] set out with thirty soldiers to pursue the raiding party.<ref name=collections/> Arriving at Sinsinawa Mound, they buried the two "most shockingly mutilated" settlers there; both Thompson and Boxley had been [[scalping|scalped]] and Thompson's heart had been removed.<ref name=trask/> Stephenson then followed the Sauk trail to the Mississippi River where it went cold, the raiders having apparently crossed the river. Stephenson's party returned to Galena empty handed.<ref name=chronology/> [[Henry Dodge]] ordered the various elements of the militia to rendezvous at [[Fort Hamilton (Wisconsin)|Fort Hamilton]] to eventually join General Henry Atkinson near present-day [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. When word of the attack at Sinsinawa Mound reached George W. Jones he left the volunteers under the command of Dodge and returned to the settlement at the mound.<ref name=chronology/>

The attack at Sinsinawa Mound, compounded by other incidents around the region, helped contribute to the fear gripping the settlers.<ref name=trask/> The people of [[Platteville, Wisconsin|Platteville]], in present-day [[Wisconsin]], contemplated fleeing to Galena, about 25 [[mile]]s (40 [[Kilometer|km]]) south, as a direct result of the Sinsinawa Mound raid.<ref name=wiscmag>Wilgus, James A.

Retrieved August 13, 2007.</ref> Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American [[Ho-Chunk]] tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.<ref name=wiscmag/>
