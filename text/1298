'''Kylie Ann Minogue''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (born 28 May 1968), is an Australian pop [[singer]]-[[songwriter]] and occasional [[actress]]. She rose to prominence in the late 1980s through her role in the Australian television [[soap opera]] ''[[Neighbours]]'', before commencing her career as a [[recording artist]] in 1987.

Signed to a contract by [[United Kingdom|English]] [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer|producer]]s [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock, Aitken & Waterman]] in 1987, she achieved a string of hit records throughout the world. Her popularity waned during the early 1990s, leading her to part company from Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992. During the mid to late 1990s, Minogue distanced herself from her earlier work and attempted to establish herself as a credible and independent performer and songwriter. Her projects were widely publicised, but her [[album]]s failed to attract a substantial audience and resulted in the lowest sales of her career at the time. She returned to popularity as a [[pop music|pop]] artist in 2000, and became well-known for her elaborate [[music video]]s and expensively mounted stage shows. Diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 2005, Minogue returned to performing and recording in late 2006 after a period of convalescence.   

Although she was dismissed by some critics during her early career, she has achieved longevity as a pop music artist. She has sold in excess of 60 million records,<ref>Webster, Philip.

Australian artist [[Nick Cave]] had been interested in working with Minogue since hearing "Better the Devil You Know", saying it contained "one of pop music's most violent and distressing lyrics" and "when Kylie Minogue sings these words, there is an innocence to her that makes the horror of this chilling lyric all the more compelling".<ref>

It received widespread attention in Europe, where it reached the top 10 in several countries, and acclaim in Australia where it reached number two,<ref name="abcspecial"/> and won [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA Award]]s for "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Release". Following concert appearances with Cave, Minogue recited the lyrics to "I Should Be So Lucky" as poetry in London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] "Poetry Jam", at the suggestion of Cave, and later credited him with giving her the confidence to express herself artistically, saying: "He taught me to never veer too far from who I am, but to go further, try different things, and never lose sight of myself at the core.

Retitled ''Kylie Minogue'' in the UK following the death of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], it became the lowest selling album of her career.  In Australia, ''Impossible Princess'' became her highest selling album since ''Kylie'' in 1988, with sales boosted by a highly successful live tour. In reviewing her show, ''[[The Times]]'' wrote of her ability to "mask her thin, often nondescript voice with musical diversity and brittle charisma and genuinely great pop songs by any standard", and a live album recorded during her tour, titled ''[[Intimate and Live]]'', was successful in Australia.

She maintained her high profile in Australia with live performances, including the 1998 [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]], the opening of [[20th Century Fox|Fox Studios]] in Sydney in 1999, where she performed [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", and a Christmas concert in [[Dili]], [[East Timor]] in association with the [[United Nations Peace-Keeping Forces]].

Minogue's former stylist and creative director [[William Baker (fashion designer)|William Baker]] explained that the music videos for the ''Fever'' album were inspired by [[science fiction film]]s<U+2014>specifically those by [[Stanley Kubrick]]<U+2014>and accentuated the electropop elements of the music by using dancers in the style of [[Kraftwerk]].  Alan MacDonald, the designer of the 2002 ''KylieFever'' tour, brought those elements into the stage show which drew inspiration from Minogue's past incarnations.  The show opened with Minogue as a space age [[Vamp (woman)|vamp]], which she described as "Queen of [[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]] with her drones", through to scenes inspired by Kubrick's ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', followed by the various [[persona]]s of Minogue's career.

Her next album, ''[[Body Language (Kylie Minogue album)|Body Language]]'' (2003), was released following an invitation-only concert, titled ''[[Money Can't Buy]]'', at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in London. The event marked the presentation of a new visual style, designed by Minogue and Baker, inspired in part by [[Brigitte Bardot]], about whom Minogue commented: "I just tended to think of BB as, well, she's a sexpot, isn't she? She's one of the greatest pinups. But she was fairly radical in her own way at that time. And we chose to reference the period, which was ... a perfect blend of coquette and rock and roll."<ref>

The show attracted mixed reviews, with the main criticisms being that nothing substantially new was presented, and that the new songs did not match the appeal of her previous hits.  Despite this, the concert was made into a successful television special that drew high ratings.

Throughout her professional life, Minogue has been the subject of intense media interest in both the United Kingdom and Australia, which remained constant even while her success as a recording artist had temporarily fluctuated. Her efforts to be taken seriously as a musician have sometimes been hindered by her high profile as noted by ''[[The Australian]]'', who wrote in 1997, "When you have to lug around an image the size of Kylie's, it's difficult for any music you produce to match the hype<U+2014>especially in a country that gives scant credibility to pop".<ref>

Minogue is regarded as a [[gay icon]], which she encourages with comments such as "I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits." While part of her appeal lies in her flamboyant costumes and her confident sexual posturing, she acknowledges the [[homosexuality|gay]] community throughout the world by performing at gay venues and events, and by openly supporting [[AIDS]] charities and [[LGBT rights by country|gay rights]] causes. Her male dancers have often displayed overt [[homosexual]] attires and attitudes. She has said that she believes gay fans responded to her apparent distress when the news media began heavily criticising her in 1989, and that those fans have remained loyal, explaining, "My gay audience has been with me from the beginning... they kind of adopted me".<ref name="VH1" />

After playing the "[[girl next door]]" in her early music videos, Minogue began to touch on adult themes: a mature relationship in "Better the Devil You Know", [[lesbian]] posturing and [[drag queen]]s in "What Do I Have to Do", [[telephone sex]] in "Confide in Me", and [[prostitution]] in "On a Night like This". She performed a slow strip tease in the ''[[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]''-inspired "Put Yourself in My Place" and wore revealing costumes in many of her videos, most notably "Spinning Around" and "Can't Get You Out of My Head". She satirised her image in the video for "Did It Again", in which the four major incarnations of her career, "Indie Kylie", "Dance Kylie", "Sex Kylie", and "Cute Kylie" battled for supremacy. Her evolving image and often overt sexuality led to some critical comparisons to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].<ref>

In 1993, [[Baz Luhrmann]] introduced Minogue to the photographer [[Bert Stern]], notable for his work with [[Marilyn Monroe]]. Stern photographed her in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that she had a "similar vulnerability and awareness of the camera".

During her career she has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new "look" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' to the more traditionally sophisticated ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', making the Minogue face and name known to a broad group of people. Stylist [[William Baker]] has suggested that this is part of the reason she has entered in the mainstream [[pop culture]] of Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate simply on selling records.<ref name="lalala165" />

Despite her commercial success, and her acceptance by a large audience as a contemporary [[sex symbol]], her critics describe her willingness to display her body as an attempt to disguise a lack of talent. Her detractors, such as those discussed in the book ''La La La'', have described her as a "one dimensional performer" and "pretty, but mindless and talentless". [[Miki Berenyi]] of the group [[Lush (band)|Lush]] said "I have a massive problem with her because she epitomises the acceptable role ... it's a shame she gets so much credibility when there are so many women worth a hundred times that. It's war<U+2014>you shouldn't stick up for Kylie, she should be fought at every turn".<ref name="lalala165" /> At the 2007 Q Music Awards, at which Minogue won the Q Idol Award, [[Ian Brown]], former lead singer of the [[Stone Roses]] savaged Minogue, saying "I don't know what Kylie's doing at a music awards to be honest.  I don't think she's cute. I don't think she's good looking. Her music's rubbish - she makes music for little kids. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm putting her down, but there's a lot of great minds out there making music and she's not one of them."<ref>"[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/s/1018974_ian_brown_in_kylie_outburst?rss=yes?rss=yes Ian Brown in Kylie outburst]".

Minogue has often spoken of the stability of the team she works with. Her parents, Ron and Carol Minogue, are actively involved in her career; her father, an accountant, is her financial advisor and her mother has joined her on each of her tours. She has been managed by Terry Blamey since 1987 and the close network, along with her Stock, Aitken and Waterman origins, have led to comments that she is "manufactured", an assessment which Minogue has admitted is partly accurate, saying, "if you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go... Ultimately, yes, it's my name and I have to deliver the goods. But it doesn't happen without a team. So I try and work with the best people I can and take from them what I can. Hopefully I enhance what they do as well"<ref name="VH1" /> William Baker has described her status as a sex symbol as a "double edged sword" observing that "we always attempted to use her sex appeal as an enhancement of her music and to sell a record.  But now it has become in danger of eclipsing what she actually is: a pop singer".<ref>
