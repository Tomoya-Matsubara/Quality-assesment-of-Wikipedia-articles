The '''Palais Rohan''' (Rohan [[Palace]]) is one of the most important buildings in the city of [[Strasbourg]] in [[Alsace]], [[France]]. It represents not only the high point of local [[baroque]] architecture, according to widespread opinion among art historians, but has also housed three of the most important museums in the city since the end of the 19th century: the [[Mus<U+00E9>e arch<U+00E9>ologique (Strasbourg)|Archaeological Museum]] (''Mus<U+00E9>e arch<U+00E9>ologique'', basement), the [[Mus<U+00E9>e des Arts d<U+00E9>coratifs, Strasbourg|Museum of Decorative Arts]] (''Mus<U+00E9>e des Arts d<U+00E9>coratifs'', ground floor) and the [[Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg|Museum of Fine Arts]] (''Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux-arts'', first and second floor). The city gallery, ''Galerie Robert Heitz'', is also in a side wing of the palace.

== Historical Overview ==
The palace was commissioned by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan]], [[Archbishops of Strasbourg|Bishop of Strasbourg]], from the architect [[Joseph Massol]] and erected between [[1731]] and [[1742]] according to plans by [[Robert de Cotte]]. It was built on the site of the former residence of the Bishop, the so-called ''Palatium'', which had been built from 1262 onwards. In [[1744]], [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] stayed in the palace, and [[Marie Antoinette]] stayed there in [[1779]].<ref>[http://www.jmrw.com/France/Strasbourg/pages/Musee_Arts_Decoratifs.htm The canopy room, ''in French'']</ref> In [[1805]], [[1806]] and [[1809]], [[Napol<U+00E9>on Bonaparte]] stayed there and had some of the rooms changed to suit his tastes and those of his wife, [[Jos<U+00E9>phine de Beauharnais|Jos<U+00E9>phine]].<ref>[http://ameliefr.club.fr/Kleber.html The Napoleon room, ''in French'']</ref> In 1810, Napoleon's second wife [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]] spent her first night on French soil in the palace. Another royal guest was king [[Charles X of France]] in 1828. From [[1872]] until [[1898]], the palace served as the main building of the imperial German ''[[University of Strasbourg|Universit<U+00E4>t Stra<U+00DF>burg]]'', up until the founding and opening of the new "Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universit<U+00E4>t". The art collection of the city (previously kept in the ''Aubette'' on the [[Place Kl<U+00E9>ber]], which had been burned after Prussian artillery fire on [[August 24]], [[1870]]) had been completely destroyed during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. As of [[1898]] and during the course of the re-establishment of the art collection, the palace became the seat of the imperial museums of Strasbourg. On August 11, [[1944]], the building was damaged by English and American bombs. The restoration of the premises was completed in the 1990s.

== Structure ==
The palace is built on a nearly square base which falls away toward the [[Ill]] River and is subdivided around a three-part inner court by a gallery. South of that, there is a main wing for the [[Prince-Bishop|Prince-Archbishop]], with its two representative [[Classicism|Classic]] fa<U+00E7>ades, which extends the entire width of the building. The most extravagant and overwhelming feature, from the viewpoint of the overall impression, is the fa<U+00E7>ade which faces the Ill, with a small flat terrace with wrought-iron railings extending on both sides before it. The courtyard gate to the cathedral is wide and curved and has a roof with religious sculptures.

The chambers of the Prince-Archbishop, which can be viewed today in nearly their original condition, are divided into the ''grand appartement'' (display space, facing the river) and ''petit appartement'' (living space, facing the inner court), as in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. On both sides of the suites are the two most spacious rooms of the palace, the dining hall and the library, which both extend over the entire longitudinal axis of the wing. The library also serves as the nave of the castle's very small chapel.
