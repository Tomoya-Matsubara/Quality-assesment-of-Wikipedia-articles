'''''Ustia''''' is an extinct [[genus]] of [[biarmosuchia]]n [[therapsid]] from the [[Middle Permian]] of Russia. It is known from a single species, '''''Ustia atra''''', which was described in 2003 from an isolated lower jaw. ''Ustia'' was classified in the family [[Ictidorhinidae]], which also includes the genus ''[[Ictidorhinus]]'' from South Africa. Both are relatively small biarmosuchians.<ref name=IMF08>{{cite doi|10.1134/S0031030108090013}}</ref> Several other Russian therapsids known only from lower jaw bones have been placed in Ictidorhinidae, and the family is likely a [[paraphyletic]] assemblage representing a small body type than a true [[clade]].<ref name=SCA03>{{cite doi|10.1666/0022-3360(2003)077<0977:TNAPOL>2.0.CO;2}}</ref>
