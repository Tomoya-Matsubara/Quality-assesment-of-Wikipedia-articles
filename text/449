<onlyinclude> <!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below -->
The '''List of Oklahoma birds''' lists every wild [[bird]] [[species]] ever seen in [[Oklahoma]], as recorded by the Oklahoma Bird Records Committee. The following markings have been used:

* '''(I)''' - Introduced: Birds that have been introduced to North America by the actions of man, either directly or indirectly
*'''(E)''' - [[Extinct]]
*'''(Ex)''' - Extirpated: A bird that, while it is not extinct, is no longer found in Oklahoma. The only bird marked (Ex) is the [[Ivory-billed Woodpecker]] which was, until 2004 presumed to be extinct, but was rediscovered in the wild. However it is not now found in Oklahoma
*'''(A)''' -  Accidental: Birds that have been seen only a few times, or only once.
*'''(H)''' - Hypothetical: Birds that have had a credible sighting reported, but have not been documented with a specimen or with a suitable photograph</onlyinclude>

Birds listed as either accidental or hypothetical should not be expected to be found anywhere in Oklahoma with regularity.  Except for the accidental and hypothetical birds, only birds that are considered to have established, self-sustaining, wild populations in Oklahoma are included on this list.  This means that birds that are probable escapees are not included on this list.  The [[Barbary Dove|Ringed Turtle-Dove]] (''Streptopelia risoria'') was previously considered to be an established wild bird, and, although occasional sightings are reported from residential areas, these birds are probable escapees, and evidence of a true self-sustaining population is lacking. It is, therefore, not included on this list.  There are 469 species on this list, including 17 hypothetical species.

This list is presented in taxonomic order and follows ''The Check-list of North American Birds'' (7th ed., 1998), published by the [[American Ornithologists' Union]].  The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family accounts. Introduced, casual, accidental, hypothetical, extirpated and extinct species are included in the total species counts for North America and Oklahoma.
