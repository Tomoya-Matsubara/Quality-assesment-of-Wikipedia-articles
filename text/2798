The operation was codenamed ''snakepit'' ({{lang-ps|'''Mar Kardad'''}}).<ref name=Guard/> Senior ISAF officers, including US general [[Dan K.

ISAF forces had previously occupied the town, until a controversial withdrawal in late 2006. 

It was the first battle in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|war in Afghanistan]] in which Afghan army units were the principal fighting force. Statements from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) emphasised that the operation was Afghan-led,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/DefenceNews/MilitaryOperations/timeIsNowRightForRetakingMusaQalehBrowne.htm |title="Time is now right" for retaking Musa Qaleh - Browne |accessdate=2007-12-09 |publisher=[[British Ministry of Defence]] |work=Defence News |date=2007-12-07}}</ref> although the ability of Afghan units to function without [[NATO]] control was questioned during the battle.<ref name=Times9/> Military engagement over Musa Qala is part of a [[Helmand province campaign|wider conflict]] between coalition forces and the Taliban in Helmand. Both before and after the battle, related fighting was reported across a larger area, particularly in [[Sangin]] district to the south of Musa Qala.

== Background ==
[[Musa Qala]] is a town of around 15,000 to 20,000 people,<ref name=Telegraph12>{{cite news |first=Tom|last=Coghlan|coauthors= Burleigh, James|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/09/wafg909.xml |title=Battle for Taliban stronghold intensifies |accessdate=2007-12-18 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=2007-12-12 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=msnbc/> with another 25,000 in the surrounding area.<ref name=msnbc/> ISAF forces were first deployed in the town in mid-June 2006, as part of the "platoon house" strategy. This consisted in protecting the district centres of Northern Helmand with small detachments of British ISAF troops, at the request of the provincial governor [[Engineer Mohammad Daoud|Mohammed Daoud]]. This move met with an unexpectedly fierce resistance from the Taliban and local tribesmen, who used conventional, rather than [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] tactics, to drive the coalition from their positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmdfence/408/40807.htm |title= UK operations in southern Afghanistan |accessdate=2008-01-09 |last=Select Committee on Defense |first= |coauthors= |date=2007-07-18 |work=Thirteenth Report |publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]]}}</ref> The isolated British garrison found itself under siege and constant attack for long periods, and their replacements could only be brought in after a full battle group operation, codenamed Snakebite, broke through Taliban lines in early August.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2376780,00.html |title= Pathfinders on a four-day mission fight off eight-week Taleban siege|accessdate=2008-01-09 |last=Albone |first=Tim |date=2006-09-27 |publisher=[[The Times]] | location=London}}</ref>

The fighting ended in October 2006 when, in a controversial move, control was ceded to local tribal elders.<ref name=Standard>{{cite web |first=Bill|last=Roggio |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2007/12/the_battle_for_musa_qala_has_b.asp |title=The Battle for Musa Qala Has Begun|accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=2007-12-07 |publisher=[[Weekly Standard]] }}</ref> The deal was intended to see neither British nor Taliban forces in the town in an effort to reduce conflict and civilian casualties. At the time, a British officer commented: "There is an obvious danger that the Taliban could make the deal and then renege on it."<ref name=BBC06>{{cite web |first=Mick|last=Smith|url= http://timesonline.typepad.com/mick_smith/2006/10/message_to_the_.html|accessdate=2007-12-09 |title=Message to the Politicians: Let the Soldiers Get on with their Job!|date=2006-10-01 |publisher=[[The Times]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927094656/http://timesonline.typepad.com/mick_smith/2006/10/message_to_the_.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> The Taliban did renege on the agreement, quickly over-running the town with 200 to 300 troops in February 2007. The Taliban seizure followed a US airstrike that incensed militants; a Taliban commander's brother and 20 followers were killed in the attack. A confluence of tribal politics, religion, and money from the drug trade helped ensure the uneasy truce would not hold.<ref name=ObserverFeb>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Burke |authorlink=Jason Burke|title= Taliban town seizure throws Afghan policy into disarray |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2005459,00.html |publisher=[[The Observer]] |date= 2007-02-04 |accessdate=2007-11-23 | location=London}}</ref> At the time, the government claimed they could retake the town within 24 hours, but that plan had been postponed to avoid causing civilian casualties.<ref name=IRIN/>

Musa Qala was the only significant town held by the Taliban at the time of the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the [[Sharia]]. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force.<ref name=IRIN>{{cite web |title= Taliban impose rule, hefty taxes in Musa Qala District|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=72979 |work= |publisher=[[IRIN]] |date= 2007-06-28|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the [[burqa]].<ref name=Times14/> The town is sited in a major [[opium poppy]] growing area and became a centre for heroin trade as the Taliban allowed open heroin trading in order to tax it.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7134973.stm |title=Soldiers 'seize Taleban leaders' |accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=2007-12-09 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}</ref><ref name=Times13/>

==The battle==
[[Image:Lashkar Gar-Musa Qala Aerial map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Musa Qaleh, Helmand Province plus surrounding Provinces and some towns.]]

===Immediate prelude===
Prior to the battle, two thousand militants were reported to be holding the town.<ref name=Guard/> That was a similar claim to the 2,050 "fully armed fighters" reported by one Taliban commander, Enqiadi, in late November; at the time, he seemed confident that the whole of Helmand province would fall to the Taliban in the winter of 2007<U+2013>08.<ref name=ISN>{{cite web |first=Aziz Ahmad |last=Tassal|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?id=18412 |title=Musa Qala: The shape of things to come |accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=2007-11-29 |publisher=[[International Relations and Security Network]]}}</ref> After the battle one ISAF officer was more conservative in estimates of Taliban fighters, suggesting only three to four hundred opposed the coalition at any one time.<ref name=NATO/>

In the days before the assault, the coalition secured the defection of a critical tribal leader, Mullah [[Abdul Salaam Alizai|Abdul Salaam]], who had been governor of [[Uruzgan province]] under Taliban rule.<ref name=Times9/> A leader of the Alizai tribe, Salaam was reported to be in negotiation with the coalition as early as October 2007, causing a rift within the Taliban.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/10/30/wtaliban130.xml|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|title=Key tribal leader on verge of deserting Taliban
|first=Tom|last=Coghlan|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2007-12-23 | location=London}}</ref> His defection was personally sought by Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] and he brought as many as one third of the Taliban forces defending Musa Qala to the coalition side. However, it is unclear if they fought on the side of the ISAF or simply stayed out of the fight.<ref name=Times9/> 

Coalition military manoeuvres and a build-up of troops and supplies had continued for weeks before the assault.<ref name=Khaleej>{{cite web |url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticleNew.asp?xfile=data/subcontinent/2007/December/subcontinent_December285.xml&section=subcontinent&col= |title=NATO soldier killed in Musa Qala operation: Afghanistan |accessdate=2007-12-09 |date=2007-12-08 |publisher=[[Khaleej Times]] }}</ref> On 1 November, British forces had started reconnaissance patrols in preparation for the attack.<ref name=Scotsman6>{{cite web | last =Starkey |first=Jerome| title =Exodus as British set to attack Taleban| publisher=[[The Scotsman]] | date=2007-12-06| url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1902652007| accessdate=2007-12-10}}</ref> In the middle of that month, the MOD reported that troops from [[3 Commando Brigade|40 Commando]] [[Royal Marines]] and the Right Flank Company of the [[Scots Guards]] were patrolling outside the town to confuse the Taliban and disrupt their supply routes.<ref>{{cite web |url=

{{Bquote|The current situation in Musa Qaleh is that it is underneath the Afghan flag ...

Brigadier Mackay, commander of the Helmand Task Force, emphasised that the coalition's plan encouraged the less committed local fighters<U+2014>the so-called "tier two" Taliban<U+2014>to break away from the more ideologically-driven militants.<ref name=Scotsman17/> This strategy may have been successful; Afghan president [[Hamid Karzai]] declared that he had been approached by Taliban members wanting to swap sides after a string of insurgent exactions against civilians.<ref name=Scotsman11/> He said: "They hanged a boy of 15 from a ceiling and lit two gas canisters under him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article567987.ece |title=Taliban Town Taken |accessdate=2007-12-18 |work=[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]] |date=2007-12-11 }}</ref> Precise Taliban casualties were not reported although the Afghan Defence Ministry suggested hundreds killed, detained, or captured.<ref name=Reuters/> The insurgents claimed 17 Afghan army and ISAF killed, as well as at least 40 civilians, but their numbers are typically unverifiable.<ref name=Ahmadi>{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Coghlan| title =Taliban flee as troops retake Musa Qala | publisher =[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=2007-12-12| url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/10/wafg510.xml |accessdate=2007-12-22 | location=London}}</ref>

Although fierce in the first days, the battle did not produce the house-to-house combat that had been feared; the Taliban largely retreated without protracted resistance.<ref name=Scotsman17/><ref name=Times13/> Poor weather conditions, including fog, may have allowed them to retreat more easily.<ref name=Ahmadi/> Taliban spokesmen suggested the retreat was designed to avoid continued airstrikes and civilian casualties within the town. By the time the town centre was reached, fighting proved "unremarkable" and according to one senior US officer: "The urban center of Musa Qala was not significantly opposed, it was not significantly barricaded".<ref name=IHT13/> The final advance into the town's main bazaar by the Afghan Army was physically led by an Advanced Search Team of the [[Royal Engineers]] of the [[British Army]] followed by [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] and the main Afghan force who raised their flag for the world's press.

==Wider fighting==
[[Image:AfghanistanHelmandKajakaiDamm.jpg|thumb|Kajaki Dam, River Helmand]]
Musa Qala is just one flashpoint in the wider [[Helmand province campaign]], a coalition effort to dislodge the Taliban from the volatile province, largely led by British forces. The battle to retake the town sparked conflict in adjoining areas. In November 2007, when reconnaissance patrols began, "vicious" Taliban attacks were launched in [[Sangin]] Valley, Helmand province, to the south, including one which saw Royal Marine Commandos endure two days of rocket and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire.<ref name=Scotsman17/> Just three days before the main assault, on 4 December, British forces suffered a fatality to the north of the village of Sangin, when Trooper Jack Sadler was killed by a roadside bomb.<ref>{{cite web |url=

In the days after the main battle was launched, Lieutanant Colonel Eaton confirmed that the Taliban were attempting to create pressure in other areas but that attacks on British bases had been repulsed. One Taliban commander noted: "We have launched attacks in Sangin and in Sarwan Kala (Sarevan Qaleh) ... We have orders to attack the British everywhere."<ref name=Telegraph12/> When the principal Taliban retreat from Musa Qala occurred fighting continued elsewhere: on the eleventh and twelfth, retreating Taliban militants attacked a government centre in Sangin. They were repulsed with 50 killed, according to the Afghan Defence Ministry.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/12/afghanistan.violence.ap/index.html |title= Official: Taliban flee, 50 killed |accessdate=2007-12-12 |date=2007-12-12|publisher=[[CNN]] | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213145655/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/12/afghanistan.violence.ap/index.html| archivedate = December 13, 2007}}</ref> American, British, and other NATO special forces were specifically deployed to prevent the Taliban from withdrawing north into [[Baghran District]], and  east into [[Or<U+016B>zg<U+0101>n Province]], their traditional refuge.<ref name=Ahmadi/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Musa Qala Flag 01.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Flag of Afghanistan|Afghan flag]] is raised over Musa Qala following its recapture.]]
British officers expressed satisfaction that Musa Qala had been recaptured without damage to the town itself. However, they acknowledged that the Taliban had not been definitively defeated and would probably "have another go" in the area.<ref name=Times13>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3043168.ece |title=A pornographic deck of cards and <U+00A3>150m surprise for town<U+2019>s liberators |accessdate=2007-12-22 |last=Meo |first=Nick |date=2007-12-13 |publisher=[[The Times]] | location=London}}</ref> As often in the War in Afghanistan, Taliban fighters were believed to have merged back into the local rural population after the defeat, their traditional dress providing simple cover. In the days after the battle, counter-attacks on the town were considered likely and coalition officials suggested sustained defence would be necessary;<ref name=BBCTalibanRetreat/><ref name=Guard11/> British forces plan to reinforce Musa Qala but have emphasised that future defence of the village will be largely Afghan controlled. The optimistic picture of Afghan capability presented by ISAF command has been challenged. A reporter on the ground, writing for ''[[The Times]]'', notes that the Afghan forces "could barely function without Nato<U+2019>s protection and Nato had to cajole them to move forward".<ref name=Times9/> 

British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] was in Helmand at the time of the assault, visiting troops at [[Camp Bastion]]. He suggested success at Musa Qala would provide a step toward Afghan peace and promised continued reconstruction relief.<ref name=BBCTalibanRetreat/> Coalition and Afghan government plans include the construction of a local [[mosque]], the rebuilding of a district centre, police buildings, schools, and the repair of the electricity infrastructure.<ref name=IHT13>{{cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/12/13/europe/EU-GEN-NATO-Afghanistan.php#end_main |title=NATO says Musa Qala battle shows significant progress by Afghan army

Various Taliban supplies were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches as they moved further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started to return to the area, some with reports of Taliban punishments and claims of active [[Pakistan]]i and [[Arab]] [[jihadi]]s.<ref name=Times14>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3048928.ece |title=Fearful farmers return to Musa Qala as British search homes |accessdate=2007-12-18 |last=Nick |first=Meo |date=2007-12-14 |publisher=[[The Times]] | location=London}}</ref> A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is to use military force to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents.<ref name=BBC13/> On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated <U+00A3>150 to <U+00A3>200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.<ref name=Times13/><ref>{{cite web |url=

Strategically, control of Musa Qala is meant both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan and to serve as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult.<ref name=BBC13>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7137041.stm |title=Why the battle for Musa Qala matters  |accessdate=2007-12-22 |last=Loyn |first=David |date=2007-12-10 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.<ref name=IHT13/> 

Civilian return to the town was slow, with shops still shuttered on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when the driver was shot dead.<ref>{{cite news

Coalition and Afghan authorities continued their efforts to win over Taliban sympathizers. However a lack of coordination has created some tension. In late December, two western diplomats were expelled from Afghanistan. Governor Assadullah Wafa accused them of holding secret talks with the Taliban and proposing bribes to them.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,,2232392,00.html |title=Expelled diplomats leave Afghanistan |accessdate=2008-01-30 |last=Siddique |first=Haroon  |date=2007-12-27 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}</ref> In January 2008, Mullah Abdul Salaam was appointed governor of Musa Qala district by the Afghan government, a gesture that was destined to encourage other Taliban commanders to change sides.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://avantgo.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3155916.ece |title=Taleban warlord gets new job as governor |accessdate=2008-01-30 |last= Meo |first=Nick |date=2008-01-09 |publisher=[[The Times]] | location=London}}</ref>
