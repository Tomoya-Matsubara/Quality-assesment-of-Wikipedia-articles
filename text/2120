The '''Blue Ridge Scenic Railway''' is a short [[heritage railway]] in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Based in [[Blue Ridge, Georgia]], it follows the former [[Marietta and North Georgia Railroad]] line along the [[Toccoa River]] north to [[McCaysville, Georgia]], and its [[twin city]] of [[Copperhill, Tennessee]].  It is a [[subsidiary]] of the [[Georgia Northeastern Railroad]], which also operates [[freight]] service on the same line.

[[Train]]s generally run Fridays to Mondays from just after [[St. Patrick's Day]] in March to the last weekend in December, all week (except Wed.) during [[spring break]] (first full week of April), and [[summer]] (mid-June to the end of July) and, and all week (7 days) during October/November until [[Thanksgiving]].  A special [[Christmas]] train runs [[Thanksgiving]] weekend, the weekends following, and the full week prior to [[Christmas]] itself.  Normal trips resume for the final week of the year.

The Blue Ridge Scenic Railway started operations in 1998, and is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2007.
