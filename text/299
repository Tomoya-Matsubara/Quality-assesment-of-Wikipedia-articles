'''USS ''West Gate'' (ID-3216)''' was a [[cargo ship]] for the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War I]]. The ship was laid down as '''SS ''War Agate''''' but [[ship naming and launching|launched]] in January 1918 as '''SS ''West Gate'''''.

SS ''West Gate'' was a [[steam turbine|steam]]-powered for the {{USSB|first=long}} as part of the ''West'' boats, a series of steel-[[hull (watercraft)|hulled]] cargo ships built on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the [[World War I]] war effort. She was the 3rd ship built by the [[Columbia River Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the {{NOTS|first=long}} of the [[United States Navy]] in April 1918.

After experiencing engine trouble on her first attempt at a transatlantic crossing, ''West Gate'' was unsuccessfully attacked by two German submarines in early July 1918 while returning to port for repairs. After successfully completing her trip to France, she began her second transatlantic trip in early October. In the early morning hours of 7 October, ''West Gate''{{'}} steering gear jammed and another Navy cargo ship, {{USS|American|ID-2292|2}}, collided with and sank ''West Gate''. Seven men lost their lives in the accident.

== Design and construction ==
The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] at the [[Columbia River Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Portland, Oregon]], under the name ''War Agate'' for the British [[Admiralty]] and intended for operation by the [[Cunard Line]].<!-- Cunard --><ref name=DANFS /><ref name=Colton /><!-- Admiralty, shipbuilder --> In mid-1917, however, the {{USSB}} commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress, which would have included the still-incomplete ''War Agate''.<ref>Crowell and Wilson, p. 321.</ref> The ship had been renamed ''West Gate'' by the time of her [[ship naming and launching|launching]] on 27 January 1918. She was one of the ''West'' ships, [[cargo ship]]s of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the {{USSB|first=long}} for emergency use during the [[First World War]]. All of the ''West'' ships were given names that began with the word ''West'',<ref name=CW-358>Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358<U+2013>59.</ref> the 3rd of some 30 ''West'' ships built at Columbia River Shipbuilding.<ref name=Colton /> 

''West Gate'' was {{GRT|5,799|first=yes}}, and was {{convert|410|ft|1|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]])<ref name=Miramar /> and {{convert|54|ft|m|1}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]]. She had a steel [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] that [[displacement|displaced]] 12,185 t with a [[mean]] [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|24|ft|1|in|m}}.<ref name=DANFS /> Her [[hold (ship)|hold]] was {{convert|29|ft|9|in|m}} deep.<ref name=DANFS /> ''West Gate''{{'}}s power plant consisted of a single [[steam turbine]] driving a single [[screw propeller]] which moved the ship at up to {{convert|10.5|knots|km/h}}.<ref name=Miramar />

== Career ==
After her April 1918 completion,<ref name=Miramar />  ''West Gate'' was handed over to the [[United States Navy]] for use in the {{NOTS|first=long}}. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], as USS ''West Gate'' (ID-3216) the same day with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Alexander Watson, <small>[[United States Naval Reserve Forces|USNRF]]</small>, in command.<ref name=DANFS />

After making her way to [[New York City|New York]], ''West Gate'' took on 6,700<U+00A0>tons of cargo that included [[locomotive]]s, steel rails, and [[materiel]] for the [[United States Army]] and departed in a convoy for France on 28 June. The ship soon developed engine trouble and dropped out of the convoy to head to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]], for repairs. While headed to St. John's in moderate seas under a cloudy sky, ''West Gate'' was attacked by two German submarines at 19:15 on 3 July. One U-boat surfaced in front of the cargo ship, crossing to [[starboard]]. As ''West Gate'' quickly turned to port to evade the U-boat, a second U-boat surfaced one point to starboard. While ''West Gate''{{'}}s radio operator sent out a preemptive [[SOS]], her gunners opened fire on the two submarines. Though her gunners made hits on neither boat, both were bracketed with fire, quickly submerged, and apparently departed the scene. ''West Gate'' arrived at St. John's at 18:00 on 7 July without any further contact with enemy vessels.<ref name=DANFS />

After four days of repairs, ''West Gate'' departed St. John's for France and arrived at the [[Gironde|Gironde estuary]] on 22 July. She shifted to [[Saint-Nazaire]] three days later where she unloaded her cargo. ''West Gate'' departed on 21 August for [[Newport News, Virginia]], where she arrived on 10 September. Later in the month, she headed to New York for major engine repairs.<ref name=DANFS />

== Final voyage ==
After taking on {{convert|7187|LT|t}} of Army materiel, she departed for [[Bordeaux]] on 4 October in a convoy escorted by cruiser {{USS|Denver|CL-16|2}}. On the night of 6/7 October, noted in the ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'' as "particularly dark and rainy", the ships were having trouble maintaining their stations in the convoy. ''West Gate'' was sailing in the first column to the starboard of the guide ship, {{USS|Sagua|ID-1627|2}}.<ref name=DANFS />

At 02:28 on 7 October, while about {{convert|250|nmi|km}} south of [[City of Halifax|Halifax]],<ref>{{cite web | last = Radigan | first = Joseph M. | title = West Gate (ID 3216) | url = http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/173216.htm | publisher = NavSource Naval History | year = 2005 | accessdaymonth = 2 October | accessyear = 2008 }}</ref> ''West Gate''{{'}}s steering gear engine jammed, sending the ship veering sharply to the [[port (direction)|port]]. The crew put the ship's engines at half speed to try to drop out of the convoy. [[Lieutenant]] Spencer, the chief engineer, and his assistant, [[Lieutenant, junior grade|Lieutenant (j.g.)]] Hillery, headed to the machinery spaces to see about effecting repairs. At 02:30, men on the bridge sighted the red light from the oncoming {{USS|American|ID-2292|2}}, which had been steaming behind and to the port of ''West Gate''. Though the bridge ordered the engines raised to "full speed ahead" to avoid the collision, there was no time for the engines to respond before ''American''{{'}}s bow cut into the starboard side of ''West Gate'', near the [[poop deck]].<ref name=DANFS /><ref name=DANFS-American>{{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = American | url = http://history.navy.mil/danfs/a8/american-ii.htm | short = on }}</ref>

''West Gate''{{'}}s engines were shut down while ''American'' backed out of the tangle.<ref group=Note>{{USS|American|ID-2292|6}} suffered damage but safely reached [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] to undergo repairs. The ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'' does not report any casualties on ''American'' from the collision. See: {{cite DANFS | author = Naval Historical Center | title = American | url = http://history.navy.mil/danfs/a8/american-ii.htm | short = on | link = off }}</ref> ''West Gate'' quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued. The chief engineer and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent the explosion of the boilers. They finished the task just before the aft [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.<ref name=DANFS />

[[Gunner's Mate|Chief Gunner's Mate]] Michael B. Wallrath, who had assisted in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing to it that all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants.<ref name=DANFS /> [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant commander]] R. B. Vandervoort, <small>USNRF</small>, ''West Gate''{{'}}s commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When he climbed up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort was able to get the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by ''West Gate''{{'}}s final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed to get back to the surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of ''American''{{'}}s lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3<U+00BD><U+00A0>hours in the water.<ref name=DANFS />

A total of seven men from ''West Gate'', two from lifeboat six and five others probably killed in the initial collision, lost their lives in the accident.<ref name=DANFS /> The U.S. Navy awarded Chief Gunner's Mate Wallrath a Letter of Commendation for his actions during the sinking of ''West Gate''.<ref>Stringer, p. 217.</ref>
