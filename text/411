'''"Bring The Light"''' is a song from [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' 2007 album, ''[[Zeitgeist (album)|Zeitgeist]]''. 

"Bring the Light" features the well-known rock sound of the Pumpkins, with a somewhat over-the-top sensibility (namely, heavy vocal overdubs and a double, harmonized [[guitar solo]]).  It also features heavy use of [[palm muting]].  The song's sensibility is largely thanks to producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]].<ref>Chamberlin, Jimmy and Billy Corgan.  (Interview subjects) "[http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&videoid=15248145 Smashing Pumpkins - Zeitgeist Track by Track]" (video).</ref>  

The song was conspicuously absent from the Pumpkins' summer 2007 tour, but was debuted in the [[North American]] leg on September 13, 2007 at the Pearl Theater in [[Las Vegas]].  The song's doubled, harmonized guitar solo was replicated by both Corgan and second guitarist [[Jeff Schroeder]], producing a dual lead sound rare for the band.  The song has since been added to the regular setlist and has been well-received.

Though it has not been released as a single, it has fared better than the official second single from the album, "[[That's the Way (My Love Is)]]", in certain quarters, peaking at number 5 in [[Peru]].  It has also enjoyed airplay in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], and on [[WXRK|K-ROCK]], [[KROQ]], and [[Ethel (XM)|Ethel]], peaking at #277 on the U.S Modern Rock charts in early November. <ref>[http://w2.mediabase.com/mmrweb/AllAccess/Charts.asp?format=r3MM&showtopn=500&cutoff=1 Mediabase 24/7 - 7 Day Charts]</ref>
