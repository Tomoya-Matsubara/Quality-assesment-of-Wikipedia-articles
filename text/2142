'''''Body Count''''' is the eponymous debut album of American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Body Count]]. "Cop Killer" was originally intended to be the album's title, as evidenced by the tattoo on the original cover. Released in 1992, the album material focuses on various social and political issues ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. The album presents a turning point in the career of [[Ice-T]], who co-wrote the album's songs with lead guitarist [[Ernie C]] and performed as the band's lead singer. Previously known only as a rapper, Ice-T's work with the band helped establish a [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] audience with rock music fans. The album produced one single, "[[There Goes the Neighborhood (Body Count song)|There Goes the Neighborhood]]."<ref name="GreatRockDiscography">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin Charles |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The Great Rock Discography |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition=7th |series= |date= |year=2002 |month= |publisher=Canongate |location= |language= |isbn=1841956155 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=724<U+2013>725 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>

''Body Count'' is best known for the inclusion of the controversial song "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]," which was the subject of much criticism from various political figures, although many defended the song on the basis of the group's right to [[freedom of speech]].

While [[Ice-T]] was primarily known for his work in the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] genre, he had long been a fan of various genres of [[rock music]] and had [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] songs by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Led Zeppelin]], among other artists.<ref name="Breaks">{{cite web |last= |first= |url=http://www.the-breaks.com/search.php?term=Ice-T&type=6 |title=Ice-T Entry at The-Breaks.com |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2007-10-20 }}</ref> He formed Body Count out of this interest.<ref name="IceOpinion"/> The band comprised musicians Ice-T had known from [[Crenshaw High School]].<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wpfpxqt5ldje~T1 |title=Body Count Biography |accessdate=2007-10-20 |author= |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Ice-T states that "I knew we didn't want to form an [[R&B]] group. [...] Where am I gonna get the rage and the anger to attack something with that? [...] We knew Body Count had to be a rock band. The name alone negates the band from being R&B."<ref name="IceOpinion"/>

Ice-T co-wrote the band's music and lyrics with lead guitarist [[Ernie C]], and took on the duties of lead vocalist. Ice-T states that "I knew I couldn't sing, but then I thought, 'Who ''can'' sing in [[rock 'n' roll]]?'"<ref name="IceOpinion"/> Aside from Ice-T and Ernie C, the original line-up consisted of Mooseman on [[bass guitar|bass]], [[Beatmaster V]] on drums and [[D-Roc The Executioner|D-Roc]] on [[rhythm guitar]]. According to Ice-T, "We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in [[Los Angeles, California|L.A.]], I'd watch the news, and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. 'Is that all I am,' I thought, 'a body count?'"<ref name="IceOpinion"/>

Ice-T introduced the band at [[Lollapalooza]] in 1991, devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both [[alternative rock]] fans and middle-class teenagers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=ICE-T&sql=11:gnfyxq85ld6e~T1 |title=Ice-T Biography |accessdate=2007-10-20 |author= |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Many considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour.<ref>{{cite book |last=Apter |first=Jeff |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Fornication: The Red Hot Chili Peppers Story  |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2004 |month= |publisher=Omnibus Press |location= |language= |isbn=1844493814 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=250 }}</ref> The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album ''[[O.G. Original Gangster]]''. The song "Body Count" was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a "black [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band," stating that "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music.

Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But ''Body Count'' was intended to reflect straight anger. It was supposed to be the voice of the angry brother, without answers.

Despite Ice-T's attempts to differentiate ''Body Count'' from his work in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image.<ref name="Christie"/> Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" as rap to provoke negative criticism. "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song Cop Killer and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word ''rap'' they can get a lot of people who think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it.

==Lyrical themes==
[[Image:There Goes the Neighborhood music video.jpg|thumb|200px|The final image of the "There Goes the Neighborhood" music video.]]
Like Ice-T's gangsta rap albums, ''Body Count'''s material focused on various social and political issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like [[The Beach Boys]] sing about the beach, we sing about the way we grew up."<ref name="MorningCall"/> Ice-T states that "''Body Count'' was an angry record. It was meant to be a protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor."<ref name="IceOpinion"/> The spoken introduction, "Smoked Pork" features Ice-T taking on the roles of a seemingly stranded motorist and a [[police officer]] who refuses to aid, telling him that "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes the motorist, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is the motorist confirming his identity.<ref>Body Count (1992). "Smoked Pork". ''Body Count''. [[Sire Records|Sire]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]]. ISBN 7599268782</ref>

In the lyrics of "KKK Bitch," Ice-T describes a sexual encounter with a woman whom he soon learns is the daughter of the [[Grand Wizard]] of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count "crash" a Klan meeting to "get buck wild with the white freaks". Ice-T makes humorous reference to "[falling] in love with [[Tipper Gore]]'s two twelve year old nieces", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him "when his grandson's named little Ice-T."<ref name="Lyrics">Body Count (1992). ''Body Count''. Lyrics sheet. [[Sire Records|Sire]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]]. ISBN 7599268782</ref> In ''The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?'', Ice-T wrote that "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the [[Southern United States|South]] and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks. [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip."<ref name="IceOpinion"/>

"Voodoo" describes a fictional encounter between Ice-T and an old woman with a [[voodoo doll]].<ref name="Lyrics"/> "The Winner Loses" describes the downfall of a [[crack cocaine]] user.<ref name="Lyrics"/> "There Goes the Neighborhood" is a sarcastic response to critics of Body Count, sung from the point of view of a racist white rocker who wonders "Don't they know rock's just for whites? / Don't they know the rules? / Those niggers are too hardcore / This shit ain't cool."<ref name="Lyrics"/> For the song's music video, the word "[[nigger]]" was replaced with the phrase "black boys".<ref name="IceOpinion"/> The music video ends with a black musician implanting an [[electric guitar]] into the ground and setting it on fire. The final image is similar to that of a [[cross burning|burning cross]].<ref>Body Count (1992). "There Goes The Neighborhood". Music video. ''Body Count''. [[Sire Records|Sire]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]]. ISBN 7599268782</ref>

"Evil Dick" focuses on male promiscuity. Its lyrics describe a married man who is led to seek after strange women after his "evil [[Penis#Slang|dick]]" tells him "Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone."<ref name="Lyrics"/> "Momma's Gotta Die Tonight" follows the account of a black teenager who murders and [[dismemberment|dismember]]s his racist mother after she reacts negatively when he brings a [[white people|white]] girl home.<ref name="Lyrics"/> In ''The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?'', Ice-T wrote that the song's lyrics are metaphorical, explaining that "Whoever is still perpetuating racism has got to die, not necessarily physically, but they have to kill off that part of their brain. From now on, consider it dead. The entire attitude is dead."<ref name="IceOpinion"/>

Ice-T referred to the album's final track, "Cop Killer" as a protest song, stating that the song is "[sung] in the first person as a character who is fed up with police brutality."<ref name="McKinnon">{{cite news |url=http://newsworld.cbc.ca/arts/music/hangthemcday2.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071111055016/http://newsworld.cbc.ca/arts/music/hangthemcday2.html |archivedate=2007-11-11 |title=Hang the MC <small>Blaming hip hop for violence: a four-part series</small> |accessdate=2007-10-20 |last=McKinnon |first=Matthew |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=February 7, 2006 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=CBC News |pages= |language= }}</ref> The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio.<ref name="MorningCall"/> The album version mentions then-[[Los Angeles]] police chief [[Daryl Gates]] and the black motorist [[Rodney King]], whose beating by [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers was recorded on videotape.<ref name="Lyrics"/> In ''The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?'', Ice-T wrote that the song "[is] a warning, not a threat<U+2014>to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'"<ref name="IceOpinion"/> In an interview for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Ice-T stated that "We just celebrated the [[Independence Day (United States)|fourth of July]], which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], there were songs similar to mine."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/music/rbicet-92.php |title=Ice-T Blinks |accessdate=2007-10-20 |author= |last=Christgau |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Christgau |coauthors= |date=August 11, 1992 |year= |month= |work= |publisher=[[Village Voice]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

The [[National Black Police Association (United States)|National Black Police Association]] opposed the boycott of [[Time-Warner]] and the attacks on "Cop Killer," identifying police brutality as the cause of much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others."<ref name="Austin"/> Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence.<ref name="YouthMedia"/><ref name="Jones">{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Thomas David |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Human Rights: group defamation, freedom of expression, and the law of nations |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1998 |month= |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |location= |language= |isbn=9041102655 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=126<U+2013>129 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> Others defended the album on the basis of the group's right to [[freedom of speech]], and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film ''[[New Jack City]]''.<ref name="Shuker">{{cite book |last=Shuker |first=Roy |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Understanding Popular Music |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2001 |month= |publisher=Routledge |location= |language= |isbn=0415235103 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=227<U+2013>229 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> Ice-T is quoted as saying that "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment.

So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it."<ref name="Roc">{{cite web |url=http://www.theroc.org/roc-mag/textarch/roc-11/roc11-09.htm |title=A Roc Exclusive: Ice-T Speaks Out on Censorship, Cop Killer, His Leaving Warner Bros., and More |accessdate=2007-10-20 |last=Heck |first=Mike |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] branded "Cop Killer" as being "obscene," and President [[George H.W. Bush]] publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product.<ref name="YouthMedia"/> ''Body Count'' was removed from the shelves of a retail store in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album.<ref name="Austin"/> In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice-T concert in [[Auckland]], arguing that "Anyone who comes to this country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police, should not be welcome here,"<ref name="Shuker"/> before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal, in an effort to get it banned under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act. This was the first time in twenty years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body, and the first ever case involving popular music.<ref name="Shuker"/> After reviewing the various submissions, and listening carefully to the album, the Tribunal found the song "Cop Killer" to be "not exhortatory," saw the album as displaying "an honest purpose," and found Body Count not indecent.<ref name="Shuker"/>
[[Image:Body Count Album Cover Reissue.jpg|right|thumb|180px|For the reissue, the artwork was altered to remove reference to the controversial song.]]
The controversy escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and [[stockholder]]s threatened to pull out of the company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove "Cop Killer" from the album of his own volition,<ref name="IceOpinion"/><ref name="Time"/><ref name="Roc"/> a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for "caving in to external pressure."<ref>{{cite book |last=Oxoby |first=Marc |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=The 1990s |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2003 |month= |publisher=Greenwood Press |location= |language= |isbn=0313316155 |oclc= |doi= |id=  |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=|page=171 }}</ref> In an interview, Ice-T stated that "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record but the cops that are out there killing people."<ref name="Roc"/>

"Cop Killer" was replaced by a new version of "Freedom of Speech," a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album ''[[The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say]]''. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song "[[Foxey Lady]]."<ref name="AMG"/> Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over the Ice-T solo album ''[[Home Invasion (album)|Home Invasion]]'',<ref name="IceOpinion"/> taking Body Count with him. The studio version of "Cop Killer" has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release ''Live in L.A.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bodycountliveinla.php |title=Review of Body Count: ''Live in L.A.'' |accessdate=2007-10-20 |last=Gibron |first=Bill |coauthors= |date=February 16, 2006 |work= |publisher=DVD Verdict}}</ref> According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it too and I<U+2019>m real respected by other artists for it. But it<U+2019>s a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit|Law & Order SVU]]''."<ref name="MorningCall"/>
