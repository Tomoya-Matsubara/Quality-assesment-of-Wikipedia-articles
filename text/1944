==History==
Originally called Walrath for farmer A. J. Walrath, Amsterdam was established in 1911 by the Northern Pacific Railway on a branch line between Manhattan and Anceney. The railroad changed the name to Amsterdam because of the large number of Dutch settlers who had moved to the area in the 1890s to grow malting barley to supply the Manhattan Malting Company.
