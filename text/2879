'''Woodrow Wilson "Woody" Guthrie''' ([[July 14]], [[1912]] &ndash; [[October 3]], [[1967]]) was a [[United States|American]] songwriter and [[folk music]]ian. Guthrie's musical legacy consists of hundreds of songs, [[ballad]]s and improvised works covering topics from political themes to [[traditional songs]] to children's songs. Guthrie performed continually throughout his life with his guitar frequently displaying the slogan "This Machine Kills [[Fascists]]". Guthrie is perhaps best known for his song "[[This Land Is Your Land]]" which is regularly sung in American schools.  Many of his recorded songs are archived in the [[Library of Congress]].<ref> Library of Congress.

Guthrie traveled across the United States and spent time learning traditional folk and blues songs.  His experience following migrant workers from Oklahoma to California inspired him to write his own original folk songs about working people. He was a first-hand observer and survivor of the economic and environmental hardships of the [[Dust Bowl]] era during the [[great depression|Great Depression]] and became known as the "Dust Bowl Troubadour".<ref>Alarik, Scott.

Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children, including [[American folk music|American folk]] musician [[Arlo Guthrie]].  He is the grandfather of musician [[Sarah Lee Guthrie]]. Guthrie died from complications of the [[Degenerative disease|degenerative]] [[neurologic]] affliction known as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]].

==Biography==
===Early life: 1912<U+2013>1930===
[[Image:Guthrie house.jpg|thumb|Woody Guthrie's [[Okfuskee County, Oklahoma]] birthplace as it appeared in 1979]]
Guthrie was born in [[Okemah, Oklahoma]] to Nora Belle Sherman and Charles Edward Guthrie.<ref name="Reitwiesner"/> His parents named him after [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was elected [[President of the United States|president]] the year Guthrie was born. Charles Guthrie, known as Charley, was an industrious businessman, owning at one time up to {{nowrap|30 plots}} of land in Okfuskee county. Charley was also actively involved in Oklahoma politics and was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate for office in the county. The young Guthrie would often accompany his father when Charley made [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speeches]] in the area.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;11</ref>  

Guthrie's early family life included several tragic fires which caused the loss of their home in Okemah.  His sister Clara died in an accidental coal oil fire when Guthrie was seven, and Guthrie's father was severely burned in a later coal oil fire.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;30</ref>  The circumstances of these fires, especially Charley's accident, remain unclear. It is not known whether they were in fact accidents or the result of actions by Guthrie's mother who, unknown to the Guthries at the time, was suffering from a degenerative neurological disease.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;26,&nbsp;32,&nbsp;39</ref> Nora Guthrie was eventually committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane, where she died in 1930.  It is believed she was a victim of Huntington's Disease, which would later result in her son's death . It is also suspected that Guthrie's maternal grandfather, George Sherman, suffered from the disease due to circumstances surrounding his drowning death.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;1,&nbsp;4</ref> 

With Nora Guthrie institutionalized and Charley Guthrie living in [[Pampa, Texas|Pampa]], [[Texas]] working to repay his debts from unsuccessful real estate deals, Woody Guthrie and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma and relied on their eldest brother, Roy Guthrie, for support. The fourteen year old Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, bumming meals, and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends. According to one story, Guthrie made friends with an African-American blues harmonica player named "George", whom he would watch play at the man's shoe shine booth. Before long Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along.<ref>Guthrie's interview with Alan Lomax at the Library Of Congress Recording Sessions, as recorded in Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;28. But in another interview 14&nbsp;years later, Guthrie claimed that he learned how to play harmonica from a boyhood friend, John Woods, and that his earlier story was false. ibid, p.&nbsp;410.</ref> He seemed to have a natural affinity for music and easily learned to "[[Playing by ear|play by ear]]". He began to use his musical skills around town, playing a song for a sandwich or coins.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;28</ref> Guthrie easily learned old Irish ballads and traditional songs from the parents of friends. Although Guthrie did not excel as a student&mdash;he dropped out of high school in his fourth year and did not graduate&mdash;his teachers described him as bright. He was also an avid reader and read books on a wide range of topics. Friends remember him reading constantly.<ref name=Cray44>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;44</ref> 

Eventually, Guthrie's father sent for his son to come to Texas where little would change for the now-aspiring musician. Guthrie, 18&nbsp;years old, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa and spent a lot of time learning songs by [[busking]] on the streets and reading at the library. He was growing as a musician, gaining practice by regularly playing at dances for his cousin Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player. In addition, Guthrie spent much time at the library in Pampa's city hall and wrote a manuscript summarizing everything he had read on the basics of psychology.  A librarian in Pampa shelved this manuscript under Guthrie's name, but it was later lost in a library reorganization.<ref name=Cray44>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;44</ref>

===1930s: Traveling era===
At age&nbsp;19 Guthrie met and married his first wife, Mary Jennings, with whom he had three children.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;62</ref> Their relationship was strained by Woody's constant traveling which often&mdash;literally and figuratively&mdash;caused family upheaval. With the advent of the [[Dust Bowl]] era, Guthrie left Texas, leaving Mary behind, and joined the thousands of [[Okies]] who were migrating to [[California]] looking for work. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these [[working class]] people.

====California====
In the late 1930s, Guthrie achieved fame in [[Los Angeles]], California, with radio partner Maxine "Lefty Lou" Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial "[[hillbilly]]" music and traditional folk music.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;90<U+2013>92,&nbsp;103<U+2013>112</ref> Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family still living in Texas. While appearing on radio station [[KFVD]], a commercial radio station owned by a populist-minded [[New Deal]] Democrat Frank Burke, Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually end up on ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]''. It was at KFVD that Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about [[Thomas Mooney]], a wrongly convicted man who was, at the time, a leftist [[cause c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre]].<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;139</ref> Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to Socialists and Communists in Southern California, including [[Will Geer]], who would remain Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California. Although Guthrie was never very interested in the party dogma, he shared Robbin's leanings. Despite Guthrie's later claim that, "the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party"<ref>Woody Guthrie Archives. "My Constitution and Me" [http://woodyguthrie.org/ Woody Guthrie Archives Collection]. Manuscripts Box 7 Folder 23.1,  Unavailable online, link to Woody Guthrie Archives website for contact information.</ref> he was never a member of the Party, as he was too unpredictable from the party's dogmatic point of view. He was, however, noted as a [[fellow traveler]], or an outsider who agrees with the platform of the party without being subject to party discipline.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;151</ref> Though not a party member, Guthrie requested to write a column for the Communist newspaper ''[[The Daily Worker]]''. The column, titled "Woody Sez", appeared a total of 174&nbsp;times from May&nbsp;1939 to January&nbsp;1940. The columns were not explicitly political, but rather were about current events that Guthrie observed and experienced.  The columns were written in an exaggerated hillbilly dialect and usually included a small comic.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;153</ref> The columns were later published as a collection after Guthrie's death.<ref name="Spivey"/> [[Steve Earle]] said of Woody, "I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in very political times".<ref>Corn, David. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20021104/corn/2 Jerusalem Calling], ''The Nation'', [[October 17]], [[2002]]. Retrieved on [[November 7]], [[2007]].</ref> 

With the outbreak of [[world war 2|war]] and the nonaggression pact the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with [[Germany]] in 1939 KFVD radio owners did not want its staff "spinning apologia" for the Soviet Union; both Robbin and Guthrie left the station.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;161</ref> Without the daily radio show, prospects for employment diminished and Guthrie and his family returned to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary Guthrie was happy to return to Texas, the wanderlusting Guthrie  soon after accepted Will Geer's invitation to come to [[New York City]] and headed east.

===1940s: Building a legacy===
====New York City====
Arriving in New York, Guthrie, known as the Oklahoma cowboy, was embraced by its leftist folk music community and slept on a couch in Will Geer's apartment. Guthrie also made what were his first real recordings<U+2014>several hours of conversation and songs that were recorded by folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] for the [[Library of Congress]]<U+2014>as well as an album, ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', for [[Victor Records]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]].<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;174</ref> 

{{Sound sample box align right|Music sample:}}
{{Listen|filename=Woody Guthrie - This Land.ogg|title="This Land is Your Land"|description=Sample  of Woody Guthrie's song, "This Land is Your Land"|format=[[Ogg]]}}
{{sample box end}}

In February&nbsp;1940, Guthrie penned his most famous song, "[[This Land Is Your Land]]". Originally titled "God Blessed America" it was inspired in part by his experiences during a cross-country trip and in part by his distaste for [[Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin's]] song "[[God Bless America]]".  Guthrie thought the Berlin song was unrealistic and complacent, and he was tired of hearing [[Kate Smith]] sing it on the radio.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;144</ref> The melody is based on the gospel song "Oh My Loving Brother", best known as "Little Darling, Pal of Mine", sung by the country group [[The Carter Family]]. Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment "All you can write is what you see, Woody G., N.Y., N.Y., N.Y.".<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;165</ref> He protested class inequality in the final verses:

:''In the squares of the city, In the shadow of a steeple;''
:''By the relief office, I'd seen my people.''
:''As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,''
:''Is this land made for you and me?''

:''As I went walking, I saw a sign there,''
:''And on the sign there, It said "no trespassing."'' [In another version, the sign reads "Private Property"]
:''But on the other side, it didn't say nothing!''
:''That side was made for you and me.''

These verses were often omitted in subsequent recordings, sometimes by Guthrie himself. Though the song was written in 1940, it would be four years before it was recorded by Moses Asch in April 1944,<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;287</ref> and even longer until sheet music was produced and given to schools by Howie Richmond.<ref>Joe Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;375</ref> 

In March&nbsp;1940, Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by The Steinbeck Committee to Aid Farm Workers to raise money for Migrant Workers. [[John Steinbeck|John Steinbeck's]] book ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' was quite popular at the time. It was at this concert Guthrie first met [[Pete Seeger]] and the two men became good friends.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;168</ref> Later Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family and has recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie's mother in which she asked Seeger's help in persuading Guthrie to treat her daughter better.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man''p.&nbsp;188</ref>

Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on [[CBS]]'s radio program ''Back Where I Come From'' and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend [[Leadbelly|Huddie "Leadbelly" Ledbetter]]. Ledbetter's Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the left wing musician circle in New York at the time and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends after having busked together at bars in Harlem.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', pp.&nbsp;194,&nbsp;195</ref>

In September&nbsp;1940 Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco company to host their radio program "Pipe Smoking Time". Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940.<ref name=cray197>Cray, ''Ramblin Man''p.&nbsp;197</ref> He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary and eventually brought Mary and the children to New York, where the family lived in an apartment on [[Central Park West]]. The reunion represented Woody's desire to be a better father and husband. He said "I have to set [''sic''] real hard to think of being a dad".<ref name=cray197>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;197</ref> Guthrie began to feel that the show was too restricting when he was told what to sing, and quit after the seventh broadcast.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man''p.&nbsp;200</ref>  Disgruntled with New York, Guthrie packed up Mary and his children in a new car and headed west to California.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man''p.&nbsp;199</ref>

====Pacific Northwest====
In May&nbsp;1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved the family to the [[Pacific northwest]] when he was offered a job there. A documentary, directed by Gunther von Fritsch, was being created in support of the [[Bonneville Power Administration|Bonneville Power Administration's]] building of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] on the [[Columbia River]] and needed a narrator. Supported by a recommendation from Alan Lomax, the original idea was to have Guthrie narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was projected to take one year to complete but when filmmakers became worried about the implications of casting such a political figure, Guthrie's role was minimized.  He was hired instead for one month only by the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] to write songs about the [[Columbia River]] and the building of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack. Although the film was never released in anything but a limited form, some good did come of the project. When Guthrie and a driver toured the Columbia River, Guthrie was so moved by the lush woodland and mountains of the Pacific northwest that he said he "couldn't believe it, it's a paradise",<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.209</ref> and was creatively inspired. In one month Guthrie wrote 26&nbsp;songs including three of his most famous: "[[Roll On Columbia]]", "[[Pastures of Plenty]]", and "[[Grand Coulee Dam]]".<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;195,&nbsp;196,&nbsp;202,&nbsp;205,&nbsp;212</ref> These songs were eventually recorded and released as ''Columbia River Songs''. 

While Guthrie may have been inspired musically, his marriage did not fare as well. At the conclusion of the month in Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York.  Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.213</ref> Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage. Divorce was difficult with Mary being a member of the [[Catholic]] Church, but she reluctantly agreed in December&nbsp;1943.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;266</ref>
[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|Woody Guthrie, 1943]]

====Almanac Singers====
{{main|Almanac Singers}}
Following the conclusion of his work in Washington State, Guthrie corresponded with [[Pete Seeger]] about Seeger's newly formed folk-protest group, the [[Almanac Singers]]. Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.192-193,195<U+2013>231</ref> The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called [[Hootenanny|hootenannys]], a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]]. 

Initially Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanacs Singers termed "peace" songs. After America's entry into [[World War II]] the topics of their songs became more specifically anti-fascist. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the 'core' members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common socialist ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannys were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits between all the members, although in the case of "Union Maid", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;220</ref> 

In the Almanac House Guthrie added an air of authenticity to their work since Guthrie was a "real" working class Oklahoman. "There was the heart of America personified in Woody....And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance", a friend of the group, Irwin Silber, would say.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;216</ref> Woody would routinely emphasize his working class image, reject songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and would rarely contribute to household chores.  House member Agnes "Sis" Cunningham, another Okie, would later recall that Woody, "loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual".<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;231</ref>

====''Bound for Glory''====

Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, including many written while living in New York City.  After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography; in Lomax's opinion, Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts of American childhood that he had read.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;200,&nbsp;201</ref>  It was during this time that Guthrie met a dancer in New York who would become his second wife, [[Marjorie Mazia]]. Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious [[Martha_Graham_Center_of_Contemporary_Dance|Martha Graham Dance School]] where she was assisting [[Sophie Maslow]] with her piece ''Folksay''. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by [[Carl Sandburg]], it included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's ''Dust Bowl Ballads'' for the dance studio.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;200</ref> He continued writing songs and, as Lomax had suggested, began work on his autobiography. The end product, [[Bound for Glory (book)|''Bound For Glory'']] was completed in no small part due to the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943.<ref>Amazon.com. [http://www.amazon.com/Bound-glory-Woody-Guthrie/dp/B0007E0CZ2 ''Bound for Glory'' (Unknown Binding).] Retrieved on [[November 27]], [[2007]].</ref> It is a vivid tale told in the artist's own down-home dialect, with the flare and imagery of a true storyteller. ''Library Journal'' complained about the "Too careful reproduction of illiterate speech."<ref name=laborie>LaBorie, Tim.

====The Asch recordings====
In 1944, Guthrie met [[Moses Asch|Moses "Moe" Asch]] of [[Folkways Records]], for whom he first recorded "This Land Is Your Land", and over the next few years recorded "[[Worried Man Blues]]", along with [[Woody Guthrie discography#The Asch Recordings|hundreds of other songs]]. These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records who had joint distribution rights to the recordings.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;417</ref> The Folkways recordings are still available today with the most complete series of these sessions, culled from dates with Asch, simply titled ''The Asch Recordings''.

====World War II years====
Guthrie unsuccessfully lobbied the United States Army in an attempt to avoid the draft.  He believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems at home were the best use of his talents.  When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friend [[Cisco Houston]], pressured Guthrie along with [[Jim Longhi]] to join the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]].<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;277<U+2013>280,&nbsp;287<U+2013>291</ref> Guthrie served as a mess man and dish washer, but would frequently entertain the crew and troops to buoy the spirits on transatlantic voyages. Guthrie made attempts to write about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with the results. Longhi would later write about these experiences in his book ''Woody, Cisco and Me''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Longhi |first=Jim |authorlink= Jim Longhi |title= "Woody, Cisco and Me" |year=1997 |publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=0252022769 }}</ref> The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his military service. In 1945, Guthrie's association with Communism made him ineligible for further service in the Merchant Marine and he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&nbsp;302<U+2013>303</ref>

Guthrie and [[Marjorie Guthrie|Marjorie]] were married while he was on [[Wiktionary:furlough|furlough]] from the Army.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;312</ref> After his discharge, they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in [[Coney Island]] and over time had four children.  One of their children, Cathy, died at age four as a result of a fire, sending Guthrie into a serious depression.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;344<U+2013>351 </ref> Their other children were named Joady, Nora and Arlo. [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]] followed in his father's footsteps as a singer-songwriter. During this period, Guthrie wrote and recorded, ''[[Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child]]'', a collection of [[children's music]], which includes the song "Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin')", written when Arlo was about nine years old. 

The 1948 [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|crash]] of a plane carrying 28 Mexican farm workers from [[Oakland, California]], on their way to be [[deportation|deported]] back to Mexico inspired Woody to write "[[Deportee (Plane Wreck At Los Gatos)]]".<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;364<U+2013>365</ref>

====Mermaid Avenue====
The years living on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie's most productive periods as a writer. His extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by Marjorie and later his estate, mostly handled by Guthrie's daughter Nora. Several of the manuscripts contain scribblings by a young Arlo and the other Guthrie offspring.<ref>{{cite web | last = WoodyGuthrie.org| title = Woody Guthrie Archives | url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/archives/archivesindex.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-10 }}
</ref>

During this time [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] studied extensively under Guthrie, visiting his  home and observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Due to Guthrie's illness, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo would later claim that they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If you want to learn something, just steal it <U+2014> that's the way I learned from Lead Belly."<ref>{{cite web | last = Reitwiesner | first = William Addams | title = Guthrie Family Ancestry | url=http://ramblinjack.com/bio2.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>

===1950s and 1960s===
====Deteriorating health====
By the late 1940s, Guthrie's health was worsening and his behavior becoming extremely erratic. He received various diagnoses (including [[alcoholism]] and [[schizophrenia]]), but in 1952 was finally diagnosed to be suffering from [[Huntington's Disease]], the [[genetic disorder]] believed to have caused the death of his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her and they eventually divorced.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;388<U+2013>394,&nbsp;399</ref> 

Upon his return to California, Guthrie lived in a compound owned by Will Geer with blacklisted singers and actors waiting out the political climate. As his health worsened he met and married his third wife, Anneke Van Kirk, and they had a child, Lorina Lynn. The couple moved to Florida briefly, living in a bus on land owned by a friend. Guthrie's arm was hurt in a campfire accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although in time he regained movement in the arm he was not able to play the guitar again. In 1954 the couple returned to New York.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;418<U+2013>419</ref> Shortly after that, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Anneke left New York, allowing friends to adopt Lorina Lynn. After the divorce, Guthrie's second wife Marjorie reentered his life.  Marjorie cared for him and assisted him until his death. 

Guthrie, increasingly unable to control his muscle movements, was hospitalized at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]] from 1956 to 1961, at Brooklyn State Hospital until 1966,<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;433<U+2013>439</ref> and finally at [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]] until his death.<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;460 </ref> Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and played on the hospital grounds. Eventually a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for these Sunday visits lasting until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to where Marjorie lived. Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated due to a lack of information about the disease at the time. However, his death helped raise awareness of the disease and led Marjorie to help found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]]. None of Guthrie's three remaining children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's, but two of Mary Guthrie's children (Gwendolyn and Sue) were diagnosed with the disease. Both died at 41&nbsp;years of age.<ref>Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&nbsp;394</ref>

====Folk revival and Guthrie's death====
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new generation of young people were inspired by folk singers including Guthrie. These "folk revivalists" became more politically aware in their music. The [[American folk music revival|American Folk Revival]] was beginning to take place, focused on the issues of the day, such as the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] and [[Free Speech Movement|free speech movement]]. Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places like [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. Many of these musicians had heard of Guthrie, but one of the first to visit him in the Brooklyn State Hospital was [[Bob Dylan]]. Dylan idolized Guthrie, calling him his hero. Soon after learning of Guthrie's whereabouts, these new, young folk singers regularly visited him during the final years of his life, playing his own songs for him as well as their originals.<ref>{{cite web | last = Reitwiesner | first = William Addams | title = Guthrie Family Ancestry | date=[[May 31]], [[1983]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896825,00.html | publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate = 2007-04-10 }}</ref> Guthrie died of complications of the disease in 1967.  By the time of his death, his work had been discovered by a new audience, introduced to them in part through [[Bob Dylan]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival, and his son [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]]. Since his death, artists have paid tribute to Guthrie by covering his songs or by dedicating songs to him. One of the first artists to do so was English folk artist Donovan, who covered Guthrie's "Car, Car (Riding in My Car)" on his 1965 debut album ''What's Bin Did And What's Bin Hid''.<ref>CD Universe.
