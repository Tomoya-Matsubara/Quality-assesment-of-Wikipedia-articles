'''Edward Vincent Kilfeather''' (April 5, 1900, [[Portland, Oregon]] - January 13, 1950, [[Los Angeles, California]]) was a musical [[composer]] and [[arrangement|arranger]] who worked on the [[Columbia Pictures]]' [[animated cartoon]]s.

Kilfeather was born in 1900<ref>1900 U.S. Census, familysearch.org image file of handwritten census return</ref> to Edward and Hannah Kilfeather and grew up in Portland, Oregon. His father was a well-known Democrat found guilty of jury bribing in 1898.<ref>''San Francisco Call'', Jan. 16, 1898</ref>. The young Kilfeather hooked up with another Portlander, [[George Olsen]], who had formed a band and was its pianist, conductor and arranger. The band headed south and in San Francisco when it was hired by [[Flo Ziegfeld]] in 1923 to come to New Year to play music for the show ''[[Kid Boots]]''.<ref>''The Big Band Almanac'', Leo Walker</ref> Kilfeather co-wrote the song ''Goin' Home Blues'' for the show.<ref>''Catalog of Copyright Entries, Part 3, Issues 5-6'', Library of Congress</ref>. Ziegfield became enraged with the band after the opening of ''[[Whoopee!]]'' in 1928. While on the road in Pittsburgh, he fired Kilfeather and replaced him with a personal favorite. Olsen protested by having his musicians refuse to play for the replacement. Ziegfeld relented and gave Kilfeather his job back. The Olsen band quit when the week was over.<ref>''Eddie Cantor: A Life in Show Business'', Gregory Koseluk, page 142</ref>.

Kilfeather wrote a number of songs that Olsen recorded on [[Brunswick Records]], including ''She's a Corn Fed Indiana Girl''. (1926)<ref>''Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical Compositions, Part 3'', Library of Congress, 1927</ref> He was so taken with the cornet playing of [[Bix Beiderbecke]] on a recording of ''Jazz Me Blues'' that he transcribed the notes and used it in Olsen's [[RCA Victor]] recording ''You'll Never Get to Heaven With Those Eyes''.<ref>''Voices of the Jazz Age: Profiles of Eight Vintage Jazzmen,'' Chip Deffaa, page 63.</ref>

Quitting the Olsen band, he moved to Los Angeles in 1931 to play with Sam Coslow's orchestra at the [[Roosevelt_Hotel_(Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]].<ref>''Los Angeles Times, May 25, 1931</ref> He arrived at the [[Charles Mintz]] cartoon studio in 1937 and stayed after it was absorbed by Columbia in 1941. His first short was ''Merry Mannequins'' and he was involved in 64 cartoons through the release of ''Up N' Atom'' in 1947.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0453010/</ref>. He was the studio's musical director, sometimes working in conjunction with composer [[Paul Worth]].

Kilfeather died in 1950, leaving behind his wife, the former [[Adelaide Robinson]], who died in 1991, and a daughter.
