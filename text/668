== Bangladesh liberation war ==
Akbar Ali actively participated in the [[civil disobedience]] movement before the commencement of the war of liberation in 1971. When the war began, he decided to supply ammunition to the guerrilla fighters, still in the capacity of the SDO of Habiganj. As the [[Mujibnagar government]] was yet to be formed and war of liberation remained to be formally launched,  many police officers disagreed to give arms and ammunation without a written order. Khan fearlessly gave written note ordering to provide the freedom fighters with food and money. He helped to send nearly three Crore taka to [[Agartala]] by a truck to raise funds for the Bangladesh Government. He took the risk to open to help with the foods for the guerrilla fighters. Later he left Bangladesh, the then [[East Pakistan]] and moved to Agartala, India across the border to physically participate in the war of liberation. 

He said, "After reaching Agartala we focused on building up an 'eastern administration'. Our main aim was to support the freedom fighters and to help the refugees who had left Bangladesh and lived in camps. We established connection with the [[Mujibnagar Government]] after a few months of its formation on 17 April 1971. During the initial months we had to struggle single-handedly". 

In July, he was asked to come to Kolkata ([[Calcutta]]) to join the government. There he began working at the Cabinet division as a deputy secretary. Later, in August, he was trasferred to Defense Ministry.<ref name=Akbar/>
