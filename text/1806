'''Liselotte Herrmann''' (called "Lilo", born [[23 June]] [[1906]] or [[1909]] in [[Berlin]]; died [[20 June]] [[1938]] in Berlin-[[Pl<U+00F6>tzensee]], executed) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Communist]] [[Widerstand|resistance]] fighter during the [[Third Reich]].

== Early years ==
Liselotte Herrmann, an [[engineer]]'s daughter, had a [[middle-class]] liberal upbringing. After completing her ''[[Abitur]]'', she went to work in a chemical [[factory]] to support her studies in [[chemistry]], starting in [[1929]], and later also in [[biology]] as of [[1931]]. She took these programmes at the ''Technische Hochschule Stuttgart'' (now the [[University of Stuttgart]]) and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. She joined the ''Kommunistischer Jugendverband Deutschlands'' ("Communist Youth Federation of Germany") in [[1928]] or [[1930]], and also became a member of the ''Roter Studentenbund'' ("Red Students' League"). From 1931, she was a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD).

== Opposition activities ==
Early in [[1933]], she signed a "Call for the Defence of Democratic Rights and Freedoms" at the university in Berlin, and was therefore, together with 111 other students, reprimanded and debarred by the university on [[11 July]] 1933. From that time, she worked illegally against Germany's [[fascist]] [[dictatorship]]. On [[20 December]] 1933, her husband was slain in [[Gestapo]] custody.

She took a job as a [[nanny]] and socialized with the armed resistance within the KPD. In [[1934]], Liselotte's son Walter was born. From September of the same year, she lived once again in [[Stuttgart]], where she worked as a [[shorthand]] typist at her father's engineering office.

She reestablished contacts with the now banned KPD. From late 1934, she worked as a technical aid with [[Stefan Lovasz]], the [[W<U+00FC>rttemberg]] KPD leader. She obtained from [[Arthur G<U+00F6>ritz]] information about secret weapons projects &mdash; munitions production at the Dornier factory in [[Friedrichshafen]] and the building of another, underground munitions factory near [[Celle]] &mdash; which she relayed to the KPD's office that had been set up in [[Switzerland]].

== Arrest, trial, death ==
On [[7 December]] [[1935]], Liselotte Hermann was seized. For 19 harrowing months she was held in remand custody, whilst her young son had to be cared for by his grandparents. Charged before the ''[[Volksgerichtshof]]'', Herrmann was sentenced to death by the Second Senate of the ''Volksgerichtshof'' in Stuttgart on [[12 June]] [[1937]] for "[[treason]] and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit [[high treason]]".

After a year in the Berlin Women's Prison, she was transferred to [[Pl<U+00F6>tzensee]] [[Prison]], also in Berlin, for execution. Despite international protests, Liselotte Hermann was [[beheading|beheaded]] on [[20 June]] [[1938]]. Her political friends Stefan Lovasz, [[Josef Steidle]] and Arthur G<U+00F6>ritz were also put to death the same day.

== Controversy ==
In [[East Germany]], many [[school]]s, [[street]]s, and institutions were named after her, but after [[German reunification]] in [[1990]], many were given new names in the rush to erase all references to Communism.

Indeed, even in Stuttgart, where Liselotte Herrmann studied, she has been a controversial figure. In [[1988]], unknown persons placed a simple memorial stone to her on the University of Stuttgart campus, which caused a bit of a stir. "Lilo-Herrmann-Weg" was the city's tribute to her, but it is little more than a 100 m-long blind alley affording access to public and private parking. No-one lives there. In the [[1970s]], students at the university tried to get a new residence named after her, but the university administration balked at the idea.
