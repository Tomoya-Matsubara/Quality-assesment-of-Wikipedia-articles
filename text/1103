'''Waverly''' is an [[incorporated town]] in [[Sussex County, Virginia|Sussex County]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]]. The population was 2,309 at the 2000 census.

Popular legend has it that [[William Mahone]] (1826-1895), builder of the [[Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad]] (now [[Norfolk Southern]]), and his cultured wife, [[Otelia Butler Mahone]] (1837-1911), traveled along the newly completed Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad naming stations. Otelia was reading ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' a book written by Sir [[Walter Scott]]. From his historical Scottish novels, Otelia chose the place names of Waverly, as well as [[Windsor, Virginia|Windsor]] and [[Wakefield, Virginia|Wakefield]]. She tapped the Scottish Clan "McIvor" for the name of [[Ivor, Virginia|Ivor]], a small town in neighboring [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton County]]. When they could not agree, it is said that they invented a new name, which is how the tiny community of [[Disputanta, Virginia|Disputanta]] was created. The N&P railroad was completed in 1858. Waverly is the 2nd largest of the towns Gen. Mahone founded. 

William Mahone became a [[Major General]] in the [[Confederate Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], and later, a Senator in the [[United States Congress]]. A large portion of [[U.S. Highway 460]] between [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]] is named in his honor.
