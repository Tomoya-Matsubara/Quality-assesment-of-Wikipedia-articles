The ''' M249 light machine gun (LMG)''', previously designated the '''M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW)''', and formally written as '''Light Machine Gun, 5.56&nbsp;mm, M249''', is an American version of the Belgian [[FN Minimi]], a [[light machine gun]] manufactured by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] company [[FN Herstal]] (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States and is widely used by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]]. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective of a number of candidate weapons to address the lack of [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] [[firepower]] in small units. The M249 provides infantry [[squad]]s with the heavy [[Rate of fire|volume of fire]] of a [[machine gun]] combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.

The M249 is [[Gas operated reloading|gas operated]] and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding [[bipod]] is attached near the front of the gun, though an [[M192 Lightweight Ground Mount|M192 LGM]] [[tripod (weapon)|tripod]] is also available. It can be fed from both [[Belt (firearm)|linked ammunition]] and [[STANAG magazine]]s, like those used in the [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[M4 carbine|M4]]. This allows the [[Squad automatic weapon|SAW]] gunner to use rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds. However, this will often cause malfunctions where the magazine spring has difficulty feeding rounds quickly enough to match the SAW's high cyclic rate.

M249s have seen action in every major conflict involving the United States since the [[United States invasion of Panama|U.S. invasion of Panama]] in 1989. Soldiers are generally satisfied with the weapon's performance, though there have been reports of clogging with dirt and sand. Due to the weight and age of the weapon, the [[United States Marine Corps]] is fielding the [[M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle]] with plans to partially replace the M249 in Marine Corps service.<ref name="M27">{{cite web|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/07/marine_IAR_070110w/|title=Conway eyes additional testing for auto-rifle|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=July 2, 2010|publisher=Marine Corps Times|accessdate=2 July 2010}}</ref>

==Development==

In 1965, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and U.S. Marine Corps' primary machine guns were the [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 Browning]] and [[M60 machine gun|M60]]. The M2 was a large-caliber [[heavy machine gun]], usually mounted on vehicles or in fixed emplacements.<ref name="Willbanks-2004-179">{{harvnb|Willbanks|2004|p=179}}</ref> The M60 was a more mobile [[medium machine gun]] intended to be carried with the troops to provide heavy automatic fire.<ref name="Willbanks-2004-131">{{harvnb|Willbanks|2004|p=131}}</ref> Both were very heavy weapons and usually required a crew of at least two to operate efficiently.<ref name="U.S. Army-1992">{{harvnb|U.S. Army|1992}}, A-1 Rifle platoon.</ref> The [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]], the army's main individual machine gun since its introduction in World War I, was phased out in 1957 with the introduction of the [[M14 rifle]], which had a fully automatic mode.<ref name="Jones-2005">{{harvnb|Jones|2005}}</ref> "Designated riflemen" in every squad were ordered to use their weapons on the fully automatic setting, while other troops were required to use their rifle's semi-automatic mode on most occasions to increase accuracy and conserve ammunition.<ref name="U.S. Army-2003"/> Because the M14 and [[M16 rifle|M16]] rifles had not been designed with sustained automatic fire in mind, they often overheated or jammed.<ref name="U.S. Army-2003">{{harvnb|U.S. Army|2003}}, 7<U+2013>9 Automatic or burst fire.</ref> The 30-round and 20-round magazines of these weapons also limited their sustained automatic effectiveness when compared to belt-fed weapons.<ref name="Willbanks-2004-179"/>

The Army decided that an individual machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops would no longer have to rely on rifles for automatic fire.<ref name="Bonds-2002-451">[[#CITEREFBondsMiller, David2002|Bonds and Miller 2002]], p. 451.</ref> Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine gun into the infantry squad was examined in various studies.<ref name="Ezell-1983-91">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|p=91}}</ref> While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a [[flechette]]- or dart-firing [[Universal Machine Gun]] during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the [[Stoner 63]] light machine gun, a modular weapon which could be easily modified for different purposes.<ref name="U.S. Army-1968-18-22">{{harvnb|U.S. Army|1968|pp=18<U+2013>22}}</ref><ref name="Ezell-1983-89">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|p=89}}</ref> The Stoner&nbsp;63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the USMC, and later on a wider scale with the [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]].<ref name="Ezell-1983-89"/>

In 1968, the Army Small Arms Program developed plans for a new 5.56&nbsp;mm caliber LMG, though no funds were allocated (5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition was viewed as underpowered by many in the armed forces). Studies of improved 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition, with better performance characteristics, began.<ref name="U.S. Army-1968-36-41-42">{{harvnb|U.S. Army|1968|pp=36, 41<U+2013>42}}</ref> The earliest reference to studies of other caliber cartridges for the LMG did not appear until 1969.<ref name="U.S. Army-1969">{{harvnb|U.S. Army Weapons Command Future Weapons Systems Division|1969}}</ref> In July 1970, the U.S. Army finally approved development of an LMG, with no specified caliber. At this time, the nomenclature "Squad Automatic Weapon" (SAW) was introduced.<ref name="Ezell-1983-91"/> Actual design of alternative cartridges for the LMG did not begin until July 1971. A month later, [[Frankford Arsenal]] decided upon two cartridge designs for the new LMG: a [[6 mm SAW|6&nbsp;mm cartridge]] and a new 5.56&nbsp;mm cartridge with a much larger case.<ref name="Woodin Laboratory-1980-1">{{harvnb|Woodin Laboratory|1980|p=1}}</ref> Neither design was finalized by March 1972, when the Army published the specifications document for the planned SAW.<ref name="Ezell-1983-92-95">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|pp=92, 95}}</ref> The 6&nbsp;mm cartridge design was eventually approved in May that year.<ref name="Woodin Laboratory-1980">{{harvnb|Woodin Laboratory|1980|pp=5<U+2013>6}}</ref> Prior to July 1972, SAW development contracts were awarded to [[Maremont]], [[Philco Ford]], and the Rodman Laboratory at [[Rock Island Arsenal]]. These companies produced designs with Army designations XM233, XM234 and XM235 respectively<U+2014>X denoting "experimental". Designs were required to have a weight of less than 9.07&nbsp;kg (20&nbsp;lb) including 200 rounds of ammunition, and a range of at least 800&nbsp;meters (2,600&nbsp;ft).<ref name="Ezell-1983-95">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|p=95}}</ref><ref name="U.S. Army Centre Of Military History-1974-176">{{harvnb|United States Army Center of Military History|1974|p=176}}</ref>

When the time came for developmental and operational testing of the SAW candidates, three 5.56&nbsp;mm candidate weapons were included with the 6&nbsp;mm candidates: the [[Colt Automatic Rifle|M16 HBAR]], a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] (FN) [[FN Minimi|Minimi]]; and the [[Heckler & Koch HK23|HK 23A1]]. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974.<ref name="Ezell-1983-95"/> In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6&nbsp;mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry.<ref name="Ezell-1983-96-97-100">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|pp=96<U+2013>97, 100}}</ref> In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for the conversion of the Rodman XM235 to 5.56&nbsp;mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to [[Ford Aerospace]], and its designation was changed to XM248.<ref name="Ezell-1983-98">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|p=98}}</ref> A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, [[Heckler & Koch]] lobbied to include a 5.56&nbsp;mm conversion of its [[Heckler_%26_Koch_HK23#HK21A1|HK 21A1]] (instead of the standard 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249.<ref name="Ezell-1983-96-102">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|pp=96, 102}}</ref> Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.<ref name="U.S. Army Centre Of Military History-1983-240">{{harvnb|United States Army Center of Military History|1983|p=240}}</ref>

In May 1980, the FN XM249 was selected as the best choice for future development on the grounds of performance and cost, while the HK XM262 reportedly came a close second.<ref name="U.S. Army Centre Of Military History-1983-240"/> In September, FN was awarded a "maturity phase" contract for further development of the XM249,<ref name="Ezell-1983-103-104">{{harvnb|Ezell|1983|pp=103<U+2013>104}}</ref> and testing of the new weapon began in June 1981.<ref name="U.S. Army Centre Of Military History-1988-253">{{harvnb|United States Army Center of Military History|1988|p=243}}</ref> The official adoption took place on February 1, 1982.

The new gun entered U.S. Army service as the M249 squad automatic weapon in 1984, and was adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps a year later. The U.S. production model has a different butt from that of the regular Minimi.<ref name="U.S. Army Centre Of Military History-1995-43">{{harvnb|United States Army Center of Military History|1995|p=43}}</ref> It is manufactured in the FN factory in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name="Crawford-2003-17">{{harvnb|Crawford|2003|p=17}}</ref>

Although found to be reliable and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards in the form of an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were also complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-[[United States Under Secretary of the Army|U.S. Under Secretary of the Army]] [[James R. Ambrose]] suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems.<ref name="Ezell-1988-415">{{harvnb|Ezell|1988|p=415}}</ref> Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program for other purposes, including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed.<ref name="U.S. Army Centre Of Military History-1995-43"/> In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.<ref name="U.S. Army-1994">{{harvnb|U.S. Army|1994}}, Preface.</ref>

==Design details==
[[File:M249 FN MINIMI DM-SD-05-05342.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine firing an M249 from an [[M122 tripod|M122A1]] at a training range in November 2003.]]

The M249 is a belt-fed light machine gun.<ref name="Bonds-2002-451"/> It fires the [[5.56<U+00D7>45mm NATO|5.56<U+00D7>45&nbsp;mm NATO]] cartridge, usually a combination of one [[Tracer ammunition#Types|M856]] tracer and four M855 ball cartridges fed from [[M27 link|M27 linked belts]]. Belts are typically held in a hard plastic or soft canvas box attached to the underside of the weapon.<ref name="Bonds-2002-451"/>

It fires from an [[open bolt]] and is [[gas operated]]. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt and bolt carrier move forward under the power of the recoil spring. A cartridge is stripped from the belt, chambered, and discharged, sending a bullet down the bore. Expanding propellant gases are diverted through a hole in the barrel into a chamber. This pressure moves a piston providing the energy to extract and eject the spent casing as well as advance the belt and compress the recoil spring, thus preparing for subsequent shots. At {{convert|1041|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} long and {{convert|7.5|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}} in weight ({{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}} including a 200-round belt and plastic ammo box), the M249 is a cumbersome weapon.<ref name="Crawford-2003-17"/>

The barrel has a rifling twist rate of one turn in {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}. Because firing heats up the bore, the air-cooled barrel is equipped with a mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare.<ref name="Crawford-2003-17"/> A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a [[M192 Lightweight Ground Mount]] [[tripod (weapon)|tripod]] or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original gas regulator offered two different gas port sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725 rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000&nbsp;r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position gas regulator was discarded as part of a product improvement program. Sustained rate of fire, the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is approximately 85&nbsp;r/min.<ref name="Bonds-2002-451"/>

==Operational history==
[[File:5.56mm-military-rounds.jpg|thumb|The different rounds that can be successfully loaded into the M249 SAW]]
The M249 LMG entered service in 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial reactions to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip.<ref name="Eby-2001">{{harvnb|Eby|2001}}</ref> It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though a number of areas for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps which accumulated dirt.<ref name="Savage-2002">{{harvnb|Savage|2002}}</ref> Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.<ref name="Cargile-2001">{{harvnb|Cargile|2001}}</ref><ref name="Grundy-2001">{{harvnb|Grundy|2001}}</ref>

The M249 SAW was not used heavily before the 1991 [[Gulf War]], though it has been used in every major U.S. conflict since. American personnel in [[Unified Task Force|Somalia]] in 1993, [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]] in 1994, [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] in 1999, [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|Afghanistan]] in 2001 and [[Iraq War|Iraq]] since 2003 have been issued M249s. Surplus weapons were donated to [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]] and [[Tunisia]].<ref name="Boutwell-1999-70">{{harvnb|Boutwell|1999|p=70}}</ref>

Tactically, SAWs are either carried with a maneuvering unit and fired while handheld, or positioned to remain stationary and provide covering fire for other units.<ref name="U.S. Army-1992"/> The usual load of ammunition carried for the weapon is 1,000 rounds in 5 200-round belts, although up to 500 extra rounds generally get loaded into 100 round soft boxes.<ref name="Military Analysis Network-1999">[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/m249.htm Military Analysis Network], M249 Light Machine Gun.</ref>

===Persian Gulf War===
929 M249 SAWs were issued to personnel from the U.S. Army and USMC during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners who were involved in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them.<ref name="U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command-1993">{{harvnb|U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command|1993}}</ref> There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.<ref name="Bruning-2006-61">{{harvnb|Bruning|2006|p=61}}</ref>

===Afghanistan===
The standard squad automatic weapon in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the [[M240 machine gun]]. Almost every eight-man squad deployed is issued two M249s. Most M249s were given a collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat.<ref name="Jane's Information Group-1996"/> Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.<ref name="Military Analysis Network-1999"/>

A report entitled ''Lessons Learned in Afghanistan'' was released by Lieutenant Colonel Charlie Dean and SFC Sam Newland of the U.S. Army [[Natick Soldier Center]] in 2002. They found that 54% of SAW gunners had problems maintaining their weapons, and 30% reported the gun rusted easily. Soldiers reported ammunition boxes rattling and falling off. 80% percent of soldiers surveyed were pleased with the weapon's accuracy and lethality, yet only 64% claimed they were "confident in their weapon". Weapons clogging up with sand in the desert seems to be the main complaint.<ref name="Exum-2004-170">{{harvnb|Exum|2004|p=170}}</ref>

===Iraq War===
[[File:Light machine gun soft pack.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=a canvas pouch in universal camouflage pattern with a zipper and metal clip for mounting to the M249.|A cloth pouch (in [[Universal Camouflage Pattern|UCP]] camo) used for holding [[Belt (firearm)|belts]] of [[M27 link|linked]] ammunition, this one being capable of holding up to 200 rounds.]]
The PIP and Para versions of the M249 have also been used in the Iraq war since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]]. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost twenty years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape.<ref name="Bruning-2006-61"/> The lethality of the 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times.<ref>{{harvnb|Cordesman|2003|p=383}}</ref> As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned very regularly.<ref name="Bruning-2006-61"/>

''Operation Iraqi Freedom PEO Soldier Lessons Learned'', a report on the performance of weapons in the Iraq War, was published by Lieutenant Colonel Jim Smith of the U.S. Army on May 15, 2003. Smith spoke positively of the M249, claiming that it "provided the requisite firepower at the squad level as intended". He praised the SPW variant, noting that its "short barrel and forward pistol grip allowed for very effective use of the SAW in urban terrain". At the [[National Defense Industrial Association]] in 2007, LTC Al Kelly of the [[17th Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion, 17th Infantry]] gave a presentation describing the M249 as having "good range, excellent reliability" and an "excellent tracer". He said that a cloth pouch was preferred over the plastic box for holding linked ammunition, and that "knock-down power is poor but is compensated by rate of fire".<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2003}}</ref>

;M249 PIP
:The product improvement program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock with a plastic stock based upon the shape of the heavier [[M240 machine gun]]. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil.<ref>[http://www.fnhusa.com/le/products/firearms/family.asp?fid=FNF014&gid=FNG008 FNH USA website], M249 description.</ref> In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the product improvement kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed carrying handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or [[chamfer]]ed to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, [[flash suppressor]], and sights.<ref name="Jane's Information Group-1994">{{harvnb|Jane's Information Group|1994}}</ref> Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100 and 200 round fabric "soft pack" magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and [[picatinny rail]]s for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.<ref name="Jane's Information Group-1996">{{harvnb|Jane's Information Group|1996}}</ref><ref name="Jane's Information Group-1998">{{harvnb|Jane's Information Group|1998}}</ref>

;M249 Para
:The M249 Para is a compact version of the gun with a shorter barrel and sliding aluminum buttstock, so-called because of its intended use by airborne troops. It is much shorter and considerably lighter than the regular M249 at {{convert|893|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} long and {{convert|7.1|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}} in weight.<ref name="Crawford-2003-56"/> The Army's Rapid Fielding Initiative is in the process of replacing the original collapsible buttstock with an adjustable model based loosely on the design of the [[M4 carbine]] buttstock.

;M249 Special Purpose Weapon
:This lightweight and shorter version of the M249 is designed to meet [[USSOCOM]] special operations forces requirements. The carrying handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lug all have been removed to reduce weight. As a result, the SPW cannot be mounted in vehicles or use M16 magazines. Picatinny rails were added to the feed cover and forearm for the mounting of optics, lasers, vertical foregrips, and other M4 [[SOPMOD]] kit accessories. The SPW also has a detachable bipod. The SPW's lightweight barrel is longer than that of the Para model, giving it a total length of {{convert|908|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} and a weight of {{convert|5.7|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name="Crawford-2003-17"/>

;Mk 46 Mod 0
:This is a variant of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the [[United States Naval Special Warfare Command|US Naval Special Warfare Command]] (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the carrying handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the collapsible buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm also differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted barrel of the same length.<ref name="Pushies-2004-88">{{harvnb|Pushies|2004|p=88}}</ref>

;Mk 48
{{Main|Mk 48 machine gun}}
:This is a [[7.62<U+00D7>51mm NATO|7.62<U+00D7>51&nbsp;mm NATO]] version of the Mk&nbsp;46, used by USSOCOM, when a heavier cartridge is required.<ref name="Pushies-2004-88"/> It is officially classified as an LWMG (Light Weight Machine Gun) and was developed as a replacement for the [[M60 machine gun#M60E4 and Mk 43 Mod 0/1|Mk 43 Mod 0/1]]. The M60 based machine guns are a great deal more portable than the heavier M240 based designs used elsewhere in the US military in the infantry medium machine gun role. However the M60 based designs have a long history of insufficient reliability. Trials conducted through the mid-1990s led the US Army to replace its M60 with M240B [[General-purpose machine gun|GPMGs]]. The M240B however, weighs in at ~27.5&nbsp;lb and is about 49" long with the standard barrel. NAVSPECWAR was reluctant to give up the increased portability of the M60 (~22.5&nbsp;lb, 37.7" OAL with the shortest "Assault Barrel") designs in spite of the M240's increased reliability. A request was put in for a new machine gun in 2001, and FN responded with a scaled up version of the M249 weighing in at ~18.5&nbsp;lb with an OAL of ~39.5". The new design achieved much better reliability than the M60-based weapons while bettering its light weight and maintaining the same manual of arms as the already in-use M249. USSOCOM was slated to begin receiving deliveries of the new gun in August 2003.<ref name="WorldGuns.ru">{{Citation | last = Popenker| first = Maxim | title = Modern Firearms <U+2013> Mk 48 model 0 7.62&nbsp;mm Lightweight Machinegun (USA)| url = http://world.guns.ru/machine/mg38-e.htm| doi = | accessdate =2009-04-29 }}</ref>

==Future==
Many of the M249s still in U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps service have been worn down by continuous use and are becoming increasingly unreliable. A refurbishment program intended to extend the service lives of these M249s has been carried out, though the weapons are still deteriorating from heavy use. In particular, warping of the receiver rails is a nearly ubiquitous defect in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than [[spot welding]]. 

The U.S. Marine Corps tested the [[M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle]], a lighter, magazine-fed rifle to supplement and partially replace the M249. With plans to buy up to 4,100 IARs to complement and partially replace its 10,000 M249s (of which 8,000 will remain in service) held at [[platoon]] level,<ref name="Cox-2008">{{harvnb|Cox|2008}}</ref> it has acquired 450 of the [[Heckler & Koch HK416]]<U+2013>based weapons for testing.<ref name="M27" /> The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR. Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an automatic rifle with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and firepower of a squad. While the Marine Corps has 13-man squads, the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more firepower from the squad machine gunners to make up the difference. The U.S. Army does, however, want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons.<ref name="Cox-2008"/> They are currently working on replacing the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.<ref>[http://www.tactical-life.com/online/news/fort-benning-soldiers-evaluate-redesigned-buttstock-for-m-240b-m-249/ Fort Benning Soldiers evaluate redesigned buttstock for M-240B, M-249]</ref> The U.S. Army is also looking to replace the M249 with the [[LSAT light machine gun]].
