The '''U-Drop Inn''', also known as '''Tower Station and U-Drop Inn''' and '''Tower Caf<U+00E9>''', was built in 1936 in [[Shamrock, Texas]] along the historic [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] highway. Inspired by the image of a [[Nail (fastener)|nail]] stuck in dirt, the building was designed by [[J.C. Berry]]. An unusual example of [[art deco]] [[architecture]] applied to a gas station and restaurant, the building features two flared towers with geometric detailing, curvilinear massing, glazed ceramic tile walls, and neon light accents. It has traditionally held two separate business: "Tower Station", a gas station on the western side, and the "U-Drop Inn", a caf<U+00E9> on the eastern side. Though it has passed hands several times in its history, the building has consistently housed the same types of businesses it was originally constructed for.

Once considered a beautiful and impressive example of Route 66 architecture in Texas, the U-Drop Inn fell into disrepair with the decommissioning of Route 66. It closed for business in the late 1990s. After it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in September 1997, the building was purchased by the First National Bank of Shamrock, which then gifted it to the city. Primarily funded by a [[United States Dollar|$]]1.7 million federal grant, the city hired a firm specializing in historical renovation to restore the building to its original glory and adapt it into a museum, visitors' center, gift shop, and the city's chamber of commerce. The revived U-Drop Inn was featured in the 2006 animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' as the inspiration for the fictional Ramone's body shop.

==History==
===Early days===
Opened on April 1, 1936, the U-Drop Inn was built by J.M. Tindall using a design created by his friend, John Nunn, who scratched the design on a patch of dirt in the driveway of a nearby motel.<ref name="66 Association">{{cite web |url=http://www.mockturtlepress.com/texas/drive66east.html |title=Drive 66 (East): Old Route 66 Association of Texas |publisher=Mock Turtle Press and Old Route 66 Association of Texas  |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Remember66" /> Tindall had [[Pampa, Texas|Pampa]] architect J.C. Berry draw up the blueprints for the art deco structure, and construction began at the busy intersection of [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] and [[U.S. Route 83]].<ref name="Remember66" /> Nunn, whose family owned and ran the business, sponsored a contest to decide the name of the new building. An eight-year-old boy won a week's worth of waitressing pay (approximately $50.00 at the time) with his entry of "U-Drop Inn".<ref name="Remember66">{{cite book |title=Route 66 Remembered |first=Michael |last=Witzel |publisher=Motorbooks International |location=[[Osceola, Wisconsin]] |date=April 28, 2003 |isbn=0-760-31498-5 |oclc=51234105 |pages=79 |chapter=Chapter 2: Filling Circumstances: Highway Pump and Circumstance }}</ref> In addition to a caf<U+00E9>, the building housed a gas station that sold [[Conoco]] brand fuel and a store.<ref name="Celebrate">{{cite news |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/travel/texasneighbors/stories/DN-regnotes_0302tra.ART.State.Edition1.4683d5b.html |title=Shamrock celebrates St. Patrick's Day in the Panhandle |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=March 4, 2008 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }}</ref>  The store was never actually opened as a store, and became a ballroom and overflow dining area for the caf<U+00E9>.<ref name="Firsching OldGas">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldgas.com/info/towerconoco.html |title=Tower Conoco |first=Jay |last=Firsching |publisher=Primarily Petroliana |work=OldGas.com |date=October 6, 2003 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }}</ref>

When the business opened, the local newspaper called it "the most up-to-date edifice of its kind on U.S. Highway 66 between Oklahoma City and Amarillo", with the caf<U+00E9> considered "the swankiest of the swank eating places".<ref name="RoadTrips">{{cite book |title=Texas Road Trip: Stories From Across the Great State and a Few Personal Reflections |first=Bryan |last=Woolley |publisher=TCU Press |location=[[Fort Worth, Texas]] |year=2004 |month=September |isbn=0-875-65291-3 |oclc=54537067 |pages=66 |chapter=Mother Road: Route 66 Museum, Cadillac Ranch, Phillips 66 }}</ref> At the time of opening, the U-Drop was the only caf<U+00E9> within {{convert|100|mi|km}} of Shamrock, enjoying brisk business and becoming a successful establishment.<ref name="Route66Lost">{{cite book |title=Route 66, Lost & Found: Ruins and Relics Revisited |first=Russel Olsen |last=Witzel |publisher=Motorbooks International |location=[[Osceola, Wisconsin]] |date=May 1, 2004 |isbn=0-760-31854-9 |oclc=55482301 |pages=84 |chapter=Texas }}</ref> Nunn sold the Inn after several years, but purchased it back in 1950 and renamed it Nunn's Caf<U+00E9>. In 1957, John Nunn died and his wife Bebe sold the caf<U+00E9> to Grace Brunner who again renamed it, this time to Tower Caf<U+00E9>, and added a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus station.<ref name="Route66Lost" />

===Decline===
After Nunn's death, the building passed through the hands of a few more owners and the station sold gasoline from various other companies.<ref name="Route66Lost" /><ref name="Route66 Kaszynski" /> In the 1970s, [[Petrofina|Fina]] took over the building, painting it red, white, and blue.<ref name="Firsching OldGas" /> In the early 1980s, James R. Tindall, Sr. purchased the building, the construction of which his father had originally financed, repainted it to its original colors, and changed the name back to the original name of U-Drop Inn.<ref name="Route66Lost" /> In the mid 1990s, the building was repossessed by the bank and closed completely in 1997.<ref name="RoadTrips" /><ref name="Route66 Kaszynski">{{cite book |title=Route 66: Images of America's Main Street |first=William |last=Kaszynski |publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]] |location=[[Jefferson, North Carolina]] |date=May 11, 2002 |isbn=0-786-41553-3 |oclc=51738050 |pages=79 |chapter=Section 2 }}</ref> Up through its closing, the caf<U+00E9> at the U-Drop was praised for its low-priced and tasty "home cooking".<ref>{{cite news |title=Home-cookin' highway &ndash; a heaping sampling |first=Arnold |last=Hamilton |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=May 17, 1992 }}</ref>

In 1956, with signing of the [[Interstate Highway Act]], [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] fell into decline, with segments being bypassed via turnpikes and newer highways. With the opening of [[Interstate 40]], Shamrock became one of the bypassed towns and the U-Drop Inn, which once served thousands of travelers fell into disrepair due to neglect.<ref name="RoadsideRenewal">{{cite journal |title=Roadside Renewal |first=Thomas J. |last=Degrood |publisher=[[Texas Society of Architects]] |journal=Texas Architect |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=2005 |month=July/August |pages=42<U+2013>43}}</ref> In 1984, Route 66 was decommissioned by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]], seeming to seal the fate of the town and the U-Drop Inn.<ref name="ABC Motels">{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=3194639&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 |title=Route 66 Motels an Endangered Species |first=Justin |last=Juozapavicius |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=May 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 1990, several state and local historical associations began efforts to preserve the architectural landmarks along the old route, particularly the many derelict or abandoned motels.<ref name="ABC Motels" />

===Restoration===
Referred to as "one of the most impressive examples" of Route 66 architecture by the Texas Historical Commission,<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Mother Road: Nostalgia Drives Visitors to Experience Route 66 in the Texas Panhandle |first=Andy |last=Rhodes |publisher=Texas Historical Commission |journal=The Medallion |accessdate=April 13, 2009 |volume=March<U+2013>April 2004 |year=2004 |pages=10<U+2013>13 |url=http://www.thc.state.tx.us/medallionmag/medallionPDFs/MD03-04.pdf  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071120012503/http://www.thc.state.tx.us/medallionmag/medallionPDFs/MD03-04.pdf |archivedate = November 20, 2007}}</ref> the U-Drop Inn was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on September 18, 1997.<ref name="RegistryListing">{{cite web |url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=2097001160&site_name=Tower+Station&class=2001 |title=Texas Historic Sites Atlas&nbsp;<U+2014> Tower Station (selected data and text from National Register of Historic Places registration information) |work=Historic Sites Atlas |publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]] |accessdate=March 29, 2008}}</ref><ref name="NRHP">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/tx/Wheeler/state.html |publisher=[[National Register of Historic Places]] |title=Texas&nbsp;<U+2014> Wheeler County |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="NRHP Registration">{{cite paper |last=Olsson |first=James |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form |publisher=[[National Register of Historic Places]] |date=August 12, 1997}}</ref>  In May 1999, the First National Bank of Shamrock purchased the U-Drop Inn, then gifted it to the city of Shamrock.<ref name="Celebrate" /><ref name="RoadsideRenewal" />

The city of Shamrock began taking measures to revive the neglected structure as a tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fantastic Filling Stations |first=Tim |last=Steil |publisher=Motorbooks International |location=[[St. Paul, Minnesota]] |date=May 11, 2002 |isbn=0-760-31064-5 |oclc=49968065 |pages=73 |chapter=Chapter 10: Hard Times at Home }}</ref> In 2000, the city hired Phillips Swager Associates of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and [http://www.architexas.com Architexas], a firm specializing in historical preservation, to begin implementing a phased restoration plan.<ref name="RoadsideRenewal" /><ref name="Architexas" />

The company adapted the old gas station and caf<U+00E9> to act as the community's chamber of commerce and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity.<ref name="Architexas" /> Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, they had all been taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.<ref name="RoadsideRenewal" />

The restoration also included turning the building into a museum of its own history, giving it the authentic appearance of a working 1940 gas station.<ref name="Firsching OldGas" /> With [[United States Dollar|$]]1.7 million in funding by the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century]], the restoration was completed in July 2003.<ref name="66 Association" /><ref name="RoadsideRenewal" /><ref name="Architexas">{{cite web |url=http://www.architexas.com/pdfs/historic_preservation/tower_station_and_u_drop_inn.pdf |format=pdf |title=Tower Station and U-Drop Inn |publisher=Architexas |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }}</ref>

==Architecture==
With its glazed brick, "zigzag" [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], strong vertical elements, and the decorative structure, particularly the metal "tulip", the building is considered to be an excellent example of the [[Art Deco]] style. Art Deco was most commonly seen in large commercial and public buildings, so its use in a gas station and roadside restaurant was a rare sight.<ref name="NRHP Registration" /> The U-Drop is one of the few Art Deco caf<U+00E9>s built in the 1930s, and it stands out architecturally from its peers, as most depression-era caf<U+00E9>s had simpler and similar wood-frame and clapboard designs or followed the [[Streamline Moderne]] offshoot of Art Deco.<ref name="AlongRoute66" /> 

The original building was designed by John Nunn and architect J.C. Berry.<ref name="66 Association" /><ref name="Remember66" /> The 1-story concrete and brick building has a modified rectangular layout with a flat roof.<ref name="NRHP Registration" />  It features a flared tower over the gas station, and two canopies, one facing Route 66 and one facing Highway 83 over the front of the gas station office. In the rear, a second, shorter tower contained the restaurant.<ref name="AlongRoute66">{{cite book |title=Along Route 66 |first=Quinta |last=Scott |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |location=[[Osceola, Wisconsin]] |year=2001 |month=December |isbn=0-806-13383-X |oclc=45842985 |pages=23 |chapter=The Architecture of Americas Highway: Streamline Moderne, U.S. Highway 66, Route 66 }}</ref> The main buildings were built of [[structural clay tile]] with [[terra-cotta]] glazed brick.<ref name="Route66Lost" /><ref name="RoadsideRenewal" /> The two towers are clad in [[stucco]] with decorative green and gold glazed [[terra-cotta]] tiles and cast concrete stepped forms.<ref name="NRHP Registration" /> Designed to attract the attention of the passing motorists, the towers also feature geometric detailing, curvilinear massing, and are outlined with [[neon]] lighting added additional character and uniqueness to the building's design.<ref name="Route66Lost" /><ref name="RoadsideRenewal" /><ref name="NRHP Registration" /> 

Historically, the U-Drop Inn held two separate businesses which shared a single interior wall. The western side, commonly called "Tower Station" "is dominated by a large four-sided [[obelisk]] rising from the flat roof and topped by a metal 'tulip'."<ref name="NRHP Registration" /> The tower displayed the station name, Conoco, in all capital letters on each side, with neon lightening on the corners. Vertical-rubbed detailing goes along the base of both towers, as well as two canopies that extend south and west from the western tower. The posts of the canopies were originally encased in decorative glazed tile and vintage metal signs. Between the canopy posts are fuel islands designed to hold three fuel pumps each. 1960s-vintage pumps are currently situated on the islands, with three on the western canopy and two on the southern. A [[chamfer]]ed corner separates the two canopies. Multiple-pane windows surround the glass doors of the office station, as well as dominating much of the southern side of the building. Situated between the office and the caf<U+00E9> are two service station bays with roll-up style overhead doors.<ref name="NRHP Registration" />

The eastern side of the building, commonly called the "U-Drop Inn cafe" has a similarly designed, three-sided, shorter version of the main tower. Mirroring the "Conoco" wording, it has "Cafe" written in the same green paint with [[drop shadow]]ed lettering, and a small ornamental metal sphere perched at its top. Just below the tower, an outstretched metal and wooden sign, added in 1950, displays the name of the building and points towards the recessed entrance. This side mirrors the tiled detail found in the station side, and once had a neon "starburst" around the sign and entryway. Inside the caf<U+00E9>, the eastern and southern interior walls are lined with booths. The northern wall holds two small restrooms, with the kitchen once located in the northeastern corner. On the southern wall, a recessed doorway flanked by large single-paned windows led into the caf<U+00E9>'s main dining room. The building's exterior is pained beige with dark green accents. On the northern facade, the original brick remains unpainted.<ref name="NRHP Registration" />

==Appearance in ''Cars''== 
The 2006 [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Pixar]] computer-animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' is set in a fictional town called Radiator Springs. Many of the buildings and structures used in the town were based on real places along Route 66, with the Tower Station and U-Drop Inn's unique design and architecture becoming the inspiration for the body shop owned by the character Ramone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/PicturePages/66ShamrockUDropInn-2.html |title=Shamrock Texas U-Drop Inn |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=March 22, 2008 }}</ref>
