'''''Cheney v. United States District Court''''', [[case citation|542 U.S. 367]] (2004), was a 2004 [[United States]] [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] [[United States Supreme Court cases|case]] between [[United States Vice President|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]].<ref name="justia">{{ussc|Source=j|542|367|2004}}</ref> The case came as an appeal after the lower [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia|District Court for the District of Columbia]] ordered Cheney to disclose some of his records that would show how his [[National Energy Policy Development Group]] developed its recommendations. Cheney appealed the decision of the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, but the Appeals Court rejected the appeal. In a 7-2 decision, the Court sent the case back to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]].<ref name="cnn">{{cite news

==Prior history==
The case began when the conservative [[Judicial Watch]] filed [[Freedom of Information Act]] requests about the National Energy Policy Development Group, which Cheney headed, in 2001-2002.<ref name="nytHist">{{cite news

  | publisher = [[Judicial Watch]]
  | url = http://www.judicialwatch.org/cheneycase.shtml
  | accessdate = 28 January 2009}}</ref> These requests were denied.<ref name="jw" />

Judicial Watch and the liberal [[Sierra Club]] then sued, arguing the refusal a violation of the [[Federal Advisory Committee Act]] of 1972 (FACA), which requires committees set up by the president or by federal agencies to provide advice must conduct their business in public. The exception to this law is committees composed entirely of federal officials and employees, which [[de jure]] Cheney's committee was.<ref name="nytHist" />

However, Judicial Watch and the Sierra Club argued that because so many energy industry lobbyists were so deeply involved in the committees work, they were effectively members. Under this, the committee would have to obey FACA. In 1993, the [[D.C. Circuit]] ruled in [[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons v. Clinton]], that in such a situation, FACA does apply.<ref name="cnn" />

In July 2002, D.C. [[district judge]] [[Emmet G. Sullivan]] ruled that Sierra Club and Judicial Watch deserved to know whether private citizens had taken part in the work of the task force to a large enough degree sufficient to bring the task force under the umbrella of the law.<ref name="nytHist" />

Rather than accepting the ruling, the vice president appealed it to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, arguing that complying would force him reveal information that, under law, he does not have to reveal. Cheney also argued that the case violated the separation of powers clause of the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="nytHist" /> 

The Court of Appeals ruled that Cheney did have to turn over information. Cheney appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.<ref name="nyt" />

==Case==
The question the Court was debating was whether or not the D.C. District Court should have rejected the request from the Vice President to block disclosure of records from his energy policy task force.

The Court ruled 7-2 that the lower appeals court had acted "prematurely" and sent the case back to the court.<ref name="nyt" />

The Court did not rule on whether or not FACA should or should apply to the task force, and left to the Court of Appeals.<ref name="cnn" />

[[Anthony Kennedy]] wrote the majority opinion, agreed to by four other justices. Two justices, [[Clarence Thomas]] and Scalia would have had the case end there with Cheney not having to disclose any information.<ref name="cnn" /> [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] was joined by [[David H. Souter]] in dissenting, arguing the Supreme Court should let the case proceed in the District Court.<ref name="cnn" /><ref name="nyt" />

===Scalia conflict of interest controversy===
The case received press attention when [[Antonin Scalia]] refused to [[recuse]] himself from the case, despite having hunted ducks with Cheney and others while the case was pending in the lower courts.  Scalia filed a lengthy statement explaining why he was not recusing himself. In the end, Scalia supported Cheney. <ref name="cnn" /><ref name="wapo">{{cite news

==Subsequent history==
On May 9, 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Vice President's Energy Task Force did not have to comply with FACA.<ref name="jw"/>
