'''''Sarcoscypha dudleyi''''', commonly known as the '''crimson cup''' or the '''scarlet cup''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[Sarcoscyphaceae]] family of the [[Pezizales]] order. In addition to its main distribution in the central to eastern United States, the fungus has also been recorded once in Bulgaria. It has been frequently confused with ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea]]'', but can be distinguished from this and other related species in ''[[Sarcoscypha]]'' by differences in microscopic characteristics, such as the presence and number of oil droplets in the [[ascospore|spores]]. The species ''Molliardiomyces dudleyi'' is an [[Imperfect fungi|imperfect]] form of the fungus that lacks a [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproductive]] stage in its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The species was first collected by the botanist [[William Russell Dudley]] in October 1888, in [[Tompkins County, New York]].<ref name=Harrington1990/> American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]], who described it in the 1894 ''Annual Report of the New York State Botanist'', named it ''Peziza Dudleyi'' after its discoverer. Peck noted a physical resemblance to ''P.&nbsp;aurantia'' (now known as ''[[Aleuria aurantia]]'') and ''P.&nbsp;inaequalis'', and said that it could be distinguished from those species by its yellow [[hymenium]] and larger spores.<ref name=Peck1894/> Several mycologists have considered the species to be [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''S.&nbsp;coccinea''.<ref name=Seaver1928/><ref name=Kanouse1948/><ref name=Pfister1979/> However, as was later pointed out by Harrington (1990), "the importance of fresh material for species diagnosis, especially for noting ascospore guttulation, cannot be overstated. Although I had examined material (dried herbarium specimens) from western North America I was not prepared to recognize that group as a species distinct from the two, large eastern North American species until I saw fresh (living) material."<ref name=Harrington1990/> As is the case with many fungi, microscopic differences between similar species can only be accurately determined by examining fresh material. Harrington analyzed [[herbarium]] specimens and fresh material of North American specimens of "''S.&nbsp;coccinea''", and found that both ''S.&nbsp;dudleyi'' and ''[[Sarcoscypha austriaca|S.&nbsp;austriaca]]'' were commonly misidentified. These results echoed a similar 1984 analysis of European specimens, performed by Hans-Otto Baral.<ref name=Baral1984/>

| caption=Phylogeny and relationships of ''S.&nbsp;dudleyi'' and related species based on [[internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] sequences and [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics.<ref name=Harrington1998/>}}
The [[phylogenetic]] relationships in the genus ''Sarcoscypha'' were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s.<ref name=Harrington1998/><ref name=Harrington1997/> The [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis combined comparison of [[DNA sequence|sequences]] from the [[internal transcribed spacer]] in the non-functional [[RNA]] with fifteen traditional [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters, such as [[spore]] features, fruit body shape, and degree of hair curliness. Based on this analysis, ''S.&nbsp;dudleyi'' is part of a [[clade]] of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species ''[[Sarcoscypha occidentalis|S.&nbsp;occidentalis]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha emarginata|S.&nbsp;emarginata]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha hosoyae|S.&nbsp;hosoyae]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha korfiana|S.&nbsp;korfiana]]'' and ''[[Sarcoscypha mesocyatha|S.&nbsp;mesocyatha]]''.<ref name=Harrington1998/> All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of ''Sarcoscypha'' (containing the [[type species]] ''S.&nbsp;coccinea''), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.<ref name=Harrington1997/>

''Sarcoscypha dudleyi'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "crimson cup" or the "scarlet cup",<ref name= Healy2008/> although it shares this latter name with ''S.&nbsp;coccinea''.<ref name=Arora1986/>

==Description==
[[image:Sarcoscypha dudleyi 65010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Fruit bodies grow on wood.]]
The fruit body is {{convert|2|<U+2013>|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad and shallowly to deeply cup-shaped. The exterior surface of the fruit body is covered with whitish, matted "hairs", while the interior fertile surface of the cup (the [[hymenium]]) is scarlet- to orange-red. The edge of the cup (or ''margin'') is curved inwards in young fruit bodies. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], if present at all, is short.<ref name= Healy2008/>

The [[ascus|asci]] are 400<U+2013>500 by 12<U+2013>14&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+00B5>m]], cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are elliptical to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, and measure 26<U+2013>40 by 10<U+2013>12&nbsp;<U+00B5>m. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters that may be used to help distinguish ''S.&nbsp;dudleyi'' from some other ''Sarcoscypha'' species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together.<ref name=Harrington1990/> The [[paraphyses]] (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the [[hymenium]]) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules.<ref name= Healy2008/> The granules contain [[carotenoid]] pigments such as [[plectaniaxanthine]] or [[beta carotene]], and give the fruit body its color.<ref name=Arpin1968/>

===Anamorph form===
Anamorphic or [[fungi imperfecti|imperfect fungi]] are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and typically reproduce by the process of [[mitosis]] in structures called [[conidium|conidia]]. In some cases, the sexual stage<U+2014>or [[teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]] stage<U+2014>is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'' is ''Molliardiomyces dudleyi''.<ref name=Harrington1990/>

==Habitat and distribution==
[[image:Sarcoscypha dudleyi 74659.jpg|thumb|160px|right|In [[Strouds Run State Park]], Ohio, US]]
''Sarcoscypha dudleyi'' is a [[saprobic]] species,<ref name="urlKuo"/> and derives nutrients by breaking down the complex insoluble [[polysaccharide]]s found in woody material, such as [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]]. Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups, and are attached to buried or partially buried sticks in forests. [[Basswood]] has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species. Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring, but may occasionally also in late fall.<ref name= Healy2008/> Although the distribution appears to be largely restricted to the eastern United States,<ref name=Healy2008/> it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994, representing the first European collection.<ref name=Dimitrova1994/>
