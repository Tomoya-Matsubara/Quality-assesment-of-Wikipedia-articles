'''Cynicism''' ({{lang-el|<U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03C2>}}) originally comprised the various [[philosophy|philosophies]] of a group of ancient [[Greeks]] called the [[Cynic]]s, founded by [[Antisthenes]] in about the 4th century BC. The Cynics rejected all conventions, whether of religion, manners, housing, dress, or decency, advocating the pursuit of [[virtue]] in a simple and unmaterialistic lifestyle.

The Cynics ({{lang-el|<U+039A><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03AF>}}, {{lang-la|Cynici}}) were an influential group of [[philosopher]]s from the ancient [[School (discipline)|school]] of Cynicism. Their philosophy was that the purpose of [[Personal life|life]] was to live a life of [[Virtue]] in agreement with [[Nature]].  This meant rejecting all conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[Power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[Celebrity|fame]], and by living a [[simple living|simple life]] free from all possessions. As reasoning creatures, people could gain happiness by rigorous training and by living in a way which was natural for [[humans]]. They believed that the [[world]] belonged equally to everyone, and that [[suffering]] was caused by false judgments of what was valuable and by the worthless [[Tradition|customs]] and [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] which surrounded [[society]]. Many of these thoughts were later absorbed into [[Stoicism]].

The first philosopher to outline these themes was [[Antisthenes]], who had been a pupil of [[Socrates]] in the late [[5th century BCE]]. He was followed by [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who lived in a tub on the streets of [[Athens]].  He took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by [[Crates of Thebes]] who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of [[Imperial Rome]] in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although many of its [[ascetic]] and [[rhetorical]] ideas were adopted by [[early Christians]].

==Origin of the Cynic name==
The name Cynic derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word <U+03BA><U+03C5><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03C2>, ''kynikos'', "dog-like" and that from <U+03BA><U+03CD><U+03C9><U+03BD>, ''ky<U+00F4>n'', "[[dog]]" ([[genitive]]: ''kynos'').<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2360864 '''Kynikos''', "A Greek-English Lexicon", Liddell and Scott, at Perseus]</ref> One explanation offered in ancient times for why the Cynics were called ''dogs'' was because the first Cynic, [[Antisthenes]], taught in the [[Cynosarges]] gymnasium at [[Athens]].<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 13. Cf. ''[[The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature]]'', 2nd edition, p. 165.</ref> The word ''Cynosarges'' means the place of the ''white dog''. It seems certain, however, that the word ''dog'' was also thrown at the first Cynics as an insult for their shameless rejection of conventional manners, and their decision to live on the streets. [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], in particular, was referred to as ''the Dog'',<ref>An obscure reference to "the Dog" in Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' (3.10.1411a25) is generally agreed to be the first reference to Diogenes.</ref> a distinction he seems to have revelled in, stating that "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them."<ref>Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.</ref> Later Cynics also sought to turn the word to their advantage, as a later commentator explained:
<blockquote>There are four reasons why the ''Cynics'' are so named. First because of the ''indifference'' of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second reason is that the dog is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is
that the dog is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is that the dog is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.<ref name="dudley5">Scholium on Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'', quoted in {{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=5}}</ref></blockquote>

==Philosophy==
Cynicism is one of the most striking of all the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]].<ref name="long28">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=28}}</ref> It offered people the possibility of happiness and freedom from suffering in an age of uncertainty. Although there was never an official Cynic doctrine, the fundamental principles of Cynicism can be summarised as follows:<ref name="kidd">{{Harvnb|Kidd|2005}}</ref><ref name="long29">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=29}}</ref>

# The goal of life is [[happiness]] which is to live in agreement with [[Nature]].
# Happiness depends on being self-sufficient, and a master of mental attitude.
# Self-sufficiency is achieved by living a life of [[Virtue]].
# The road to virtue is to free oneself from any influence such as wealth, fame, or power, which have no value in Nature.
# Suffering is caused by false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a vicious character.

A Cynic, then, has no property and rejects all conventional values of money, fame, power or reputation. A life lived according to nature requires only the bare necessities required for existence, and one can become free by unshackling oneself from any needs which are the result of convention.<ref name="long34">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=34}}</ref> The Cynics adopted [[Heracles|Hercules]] as their hero, as epitomizing the ideal Cynic.<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 2, 71; Dio Chrysostom, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dio_Chrysostom/Discourses/8*.html#26 ''Orations'', viii. 26-32]; Pseudo-Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl431.htm ''Cynicus''], 13; Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''], 4, 33, 36.</ref> Hercules "was he who brought Cerberus, the hound of Hades, from the underworld, a point of special appeal to the dog-man, Diogenes."<ref>Orlando Patterson: [http://books.google.com/books?id=E0w9bA4PeOQC&pg=RA1-PA186&lpg=RA1-PA186&dq=Cerberus+Cynics+Heracles&source=bl&ots=x1qmPJVy56&sig=mMiI_KA938eJmULvCwbDWtBwXdA&hl=en&ei=TiKwSeyDKJaitge5nNngBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=9&ct=result ''Freedom''. p. 186]</ref>
According to [[Lucian]], "Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog."<ref>Lucian, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/LucianDialoguesDead1.html#4 ''Dialogues of the Dead'', 21]</ref>

The Cynic way of life required continuous training, not just in exercising one's judgments and mental impressions, but a physical training as well:
<blockquote>[Diogenes] used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile impressions at the time of its performance, as very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind and body.<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 70</ref></blockquote>

None of this meant that the Cynic would retreat from society, far from it, Cynics would live in the full glare of the public's gaze and would be quite indifferent in the face of any [[insults]] which might result from their unconventional behaviour.<ref name="kidd"/> The Cynics are said to have invented the idea of [[cosmopolitanism]]: when he was asked where he came from, Diogenes replied that he was "a citizen of the world, (''kosmopolit<U+00EA>s'')."<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 63</ref>

The ideal Cynic would evangelise; as the [[wiktionary:watchdog|watchdog]] of humanity, it was their job to hound people about the error of their ways.<ref name="kidd"/> The example of the Cynic's life (and the use of the Cynic's biting [[satire]]) would dig-up and expose the pretensions which lay at the root of everyday conventions.<ref name="kidd"/>

Although Cynicism concentrated solely on [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethics]], Cynic philosophy had a big impact on the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] world, ultimately becoming an important influence for [[Stoicism]]. The Stoic [[Apollodorus of Seleucia|Apollodorus]] writing in the [[2nd century BCE]] stated that "Cynicism is the short path to virtue."<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vii. 121</ref>

==History of Cynicism==
[[Image:Antisthenes pushkin.jpg|right|thumb|Bust of Antisthenes]]
The classical [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Cynics regarded [[virtue]] as the only necessity for [[happiness]], and saw virtue as entirely sufficient for attaining happiness. Classical Cynics followed this philosophy to the extent of neglecting everything not furthering their perfection of virtue and attainment of happiness, thus, the  title ''Cynics'', derived from the Greek word ''<U+03BA><U+03CD><U+03C9><U+03BD>'' (meaning "dog") because they allegedly neglected society, hygiene, family, money, etc., in a manner reminiscent of dogs. They sought to free themselves from conventions; become self-sufficient; and live only in accordance with nature. They rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, [[power (sociology)|power]], or [[celebrity|fame]], to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, [[personal life|lives]].<ref name="cynic1">[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cynics.htm ''Cynics''] <U+2013> ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref>

The ancient Cynics rejected conventional social values, and would criticise the types of behaviours, such as greed, which they viewed as causing suffering. Emphasis on this aspect of their teachings led, in the late 18th and early 19th century,<ref>David Mazella, (2007), ''The Making of Modern Cynicism'', University of Virginia Press. ISBN 0-813-92615-7</ref> to the modern understanding of cynicism as "an attitude of scornful or jaded negativity, especially a general distrust of the integrity or professed motives of others."<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Cynicism ''Cynicism''], ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language''. Fourth Edition. 2006. Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> This modern definition of cynicism is in marked contrast to the ancient philosophy, which emphasized "virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire."<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', page 231. Simon and Schuster.</ref>

===Influences===
Various philosophers, such as the [[Pythagoreans]], had advocated simple living in the centuries preceding the Cynics. In the early [[6th century BCE]], [[Anacharsis]], a [[Scythian]] sage had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics.<ref>R. Martin, ''The Scythian Accent: Anacharsis and the Cynics'', {{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Caz<U+00E9>|1996}}</ref> Perhaps of importance were tales of [[India]]n philosophers, known to later Greeks as the [[Gymnosophists]], who had adopted a strict [[asceticism]] together with a disrespect for established [[laws]] and [[Norm (sociology)|customs]].<ref>J. Romm, ''Dog Heads and Noble Savages: Cynicism before the Cynics'', {{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Caz<U+00E9>|1996}}</ref> By the [[5th century BCE]], the [[Sophists]] had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as [[religion]], [[law]] and [[ethics]]. However, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was [[Socrates]]. Although he was not an ascetic, he did profess a love of [[Virtue]] and an indifference to [[wealth]],<ref>Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1656 ''Apology''], 41e.</ref> together with a disdain for general opinion.<ref>Xenophon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1171 ''Apology''], 1.</ref>  These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of [[Plato]]'s philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, [[Antisthenes]].

===Antisthenes===
The story of Cynicism traditionally begins with [[Antisthenes]] (c. 445<U+2013>365 BCE),<ref name=dudley1>{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=1}}</ref>
<ref name=bracht6>{{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Caz<U+00E9>|1996|p=6}}</ref> who was an older contemporary of [[Plato]] and a pupil of [[Socrates]].  At about 25 years his junior, Antisthenes was one of the most important of Socrates' disciples.<ref>Xenophon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1181 ''Symposium''], 4.57<U+2013>64.</ref>  Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism,<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 2</ref> his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism.  In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by [[Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius]],<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 15<U+2013>18</ref> writings on [[Language]], [[Dialogue]] and [[Literature]] far outnumber those on [[Ethics (philosophy)|Ethics]] or [[Politics]],<ref name=prince79>{{Harvnb|Prince|2005|p=79}}</ref> although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time.<ref name=navia40>{{Harvnb|Navia|1996|p=40}}</ref> It is certainly true that Antisthenes preached a life of [[poverty]]:
<blockquote>I have enough to eat till my hunger is stayed, to drink till my thirst is sated; to clothe myself as well; and out of doors not [even] [[Callias III|Callias]] there, with all his riches, is more safe than I from shivering; and when I find myself indoors, what warmer shirting do I need than my bare walls?<ref>Xenophon, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1181 ''Symposium''], 4.34.</ref></blockquote>

===Diogenes of Sinope===
[[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412<U+2013>323 BCE) dominates the story of Cynicism like no other figure.  He originally came to [[Athens]], fleeing his home city, after he and his father, who was in charge of the mint at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], got into trouble for falsifying the coinage.<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 20<U+2013>21</ref>  (The phrase "defacing the currency" later became proverbial in describing Diogenes' rejection of conventional values.)<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 20, 71</ref>  Later tradition claimed that Diogenes became the disciple of Antisthenes,<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 6, 18, 21; Aelian, x. 16; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii. 22. 63</ref> but it is by no means certain that they ever met.<ref name="long45">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=45}}</ref>
<ref name="dudley2">{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=2}}</ref>
<ref name=prince77>{{Harvnb|Prince|2005|p=77}}</ref>  What is true is that Diogenes adopted Antisthenes' teachings and embraced the [[asceticism|ascetic]] way of life, pursuing a lifestyle of self-sufficiency (''autarkeia''), austerity (''ask<U+0113>sis''), and shamelessness (''anaidei''a).<ref>Sarton, G., ''Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece,'' Dover Publications. (1980).</ref>  There are countless anecdotes about his extravagant asceticism (sleeping in a tub),<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 23; Jerome, Adversus Jovinianum, 2.14</ref> shameless behaviour (eating raw meat),<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 34</ref> and his biting satire ("bad people obey their lusts as servants obey their masters"),<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 66</ref> and although it is impossible to tell which of these stories are genuine, they do illustrate the broad character of the man, including an ethical seriousness.<ref name="long33">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=33}}</ref>

===Crates of Thebes===
[[Crates of Thebes]] (c. 365<U+2013>c. 285 BCE) is the third figure who dominates Cynic history.  He is notable because he renounced a large fortune to live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens.<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 87<U+2013>88</ref>  He is said to have been a pupil of Diogenes,<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, vi. 85, 87; Epictetus, ''Discourses'', iii. 22. 63</ref> but again this is uncertain.<ref name="long46">{{Harvnb|Long|1996|p=46}}</ref> Crates married [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] after she had fallen in love with him and together they lived like beggars on the streets of Athens,<ref>Although there is no mention in ancient sources of them actually begging. Cf. Doyne Dawson, (1992), ''Cities of the gods: communist utopias in Greek thought<U+200E>'', page 135. Oxford University Press</ref> where Crates was treated with respect.<ref>Plutarch, ''Symposiacs'', 2.1; Apuleius, ''Florida'', 22; Julian, ''Orations'', 6.201b</ref> Crates' later fame (apart from his unconventional lifestyle) lies in the fact that he became the teacher of [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]].<ref>Diogenes La<U+00EB>rtius, i. 15, vi. 105, vii. 2, etc</ref> The Cynic strain to be found in early Stoicism (such as Zeno's own radical views on sexual equality spelled out in his ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]'') can be ascribed to Crates' influence.<ref name=schofield>{{Harvnb|Schofield|1991}}</ref>

===Other Cynics===
There were many other Cynics in the [[4th century BCE|4th]] and [[3rd century BCE|3rd centuries BCE]], including [[Onesicritus]] (who sailed with [[Alexander the Great]] to [[India]]), and the moral satirists [[Bion of Borysthenes]] and [[Menippus|Menippus of Gadara]].  However, with the rise of Stoicism in the [[3rd century BCE]], Cynicism as a serious philosophical activity underwent a decline,<ref name=dudley117>{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=117}}</ref>
<ref name=bracht13>{{Harvnb|Bracht Branham|Goulet-Caz<U+00E9>|1996|p=13}}</ref> and it is not until the [[Roman era]] that Cynicism underwent a revival.

==Cynicism in the Roman World==
[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|right|thumb|Diogenes of Sinope <U+2013> depicted by [[Jean-L<U+00E9>on G<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me]]]]
There is little record of Cynicism in the second or first centuries BCE; [[Cicero]] (c. 50 BCE), who was much interested in [[Greek philosophy]], had little to say about Cynicism, except that "it is to be shunned; for it is opposed to modesty, without which there can be neither right nor honor."<ref>Cicero, ''De Officiis'', i. 41.</ref> However, by the 1st century, Cynicism reappeared with full force. The rise of [[Imperial Rome]], like the Greek loss of independence under [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] three centuries earlier, may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people, which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self-sufficiency and inner-happiness to flourish once again.<ref name=dudley124>{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=124}}</ref> Cynics could be found throughout the empire, standing on street corners, preaching about [[Virtue]].<ref>Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''], 3</ref> [[Lucian]] complained that "every city is filled with such upstarts, particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes, Antisthenes, and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog,"<ref>Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl421.htm ''Fugitivi''], 16.</ref> and [[Aelius Aristides]] observed that "they frequent the doorways, talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters, making up for their lowly condition by using impudence."<ref name="aristides">Aelius Aristides, iii. 654<U+2013>694</ref> The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century was [[Demetrius the Cynic|Demetrius]], whom [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] praised as "a man of consummate wisdom, though he himself denied it, constant to the principles which he professed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects."<ref>Seneca, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3794 ''De Beneficiis''], vii.</ref> Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker. In the 2nd century, Lucian, whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher [[Peregrinus Proteus]],<ref>Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''].</ref> nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher, [[Demonax]], in a dialogue.<ref>Lucian, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6829 ''Demonax''].</ref>

Cynicism came to be seen as an idealised form of [[Stoicism]], a view which led [[Epictetus]] to eulogise the ideal Cynic in a lengthy discourse.<ref>Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], 3. 22.</ref>  According to Epictetus, the ideal Cynic "must know that he is sent as a messenger from [[Zeus]] to people concerning good and bad things, to show them that they have wandered."<ref>Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], 3. 22. 23</ref>  Unfortunately for Epictetus, many Cynics of the era did not live up to the ideal: "consider the present Cynics who are dogs that wait at tables, and in no respect imitate the Cynics of old except perchance in [[flatulence|breaking wind]]."<ref>Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''], 3. 22. 80</ref>

Unlike Stoicism, which declined as an independent philosophy after the 2nd century, Cynicism seems to have thrived into the 4th century.<ref name=dudley202>{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|p=202}}</ref>   The Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] (ruled 361<U+2013>363), like Epictetus, praised the ideal Cynic and complained about the actual practitioners of Cynicism.<ref>Julian, ''Oration 6: To the Uneducated Cynics''; ''Oration 7: To the Cynic Heracleios''.</ref>

The final Cynic noted in classical history is [[Sallustius of Emesa]] in the late 5th century.<ref>Damascius, ''Life of Isidorus'': fragments preserved in the ''Commentary on Plato's Parmenides'' by [[Proclus]], in the ''Bibliotheca'' of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], and in ''The [[Suda]]''.</ref>  A student of the Neoplatonic philosopher [[Isidore of Alexandria]], he devoted himself to living a life of Cynic asceticism.

==Cynicism and Christianity==
===Historical Jesus as a Jewish Cynic===
Some historians have noted the similarities between the life and teachings of [[Jesus]] and those of the Cynics. Some scholars have argued that the [[Q document]], the hypothetical common source for the gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], has strong similarities with the teachings of the Cynics.<ref>Leif Vaage, (1994), ''Galilean Upstarts: Jesus' First Followers According to Q''. TPI</ref><ref>F. Gerald Downing, (1992), ''Cynics and Christian Origins''. T. & T. Clark.</ref> Scholars on the [[quest for the historical Jesus]], such as [[Burton L. Mack]] and [[John Dominic Crossan]] of the [[Jesus Seminar]], have argued that 1st century [[Galilee]] was a world in which [[Hellenization|Hellenistic]] ideas collided with Jewish thought and traditions. The city of [[Gadara]], only a day's walk from [[Nazareth]], was particularly notable as a center of Cynic philosophy,<ref>In particular, [[Menippus]] (3rd century BCE), [[Meleager of Gadara|Meleager]] (1st century BCE), and [[Oenomaus of Gadara|Oenomaus]] (2nd century CE), all came from Gadara.</ref> and Mack has described Jesus as a "rather normal Cynic-type figure."<ref>Quoted in R. Ostling, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968139,00.html ''Who was Jesus?", Time, August 15, 1988, pages 37<U+2013>42].</ref>  For Crossan, Jesus was more like a Cynic sage from an [[Hellenistic Jewish]] tradition than either a [[Christ]] who would die as a [[Substitutionary atonement|substitute for sinners]] or a [[Jewish messianism|Messiah]] who wanted to establish an independent Jewish state of Israel.<ref>John Dominic Crossan, (1991), ''The Historical Jesus: The Life of a Mediterranean Jewish Peasant'', ISBN 0-06-061629-6</ref> Other scholars doubt that Jesus was deeply influenced by the Cynics, and see the Jewish prophetic tradition as of much greater importance.<ref>Craig A. Evans, ''Life of Jesus Research: An Annotated Bibliography'', page 151. BRILL</ref>

===Cynic influences on early Christianity===
Many of the [[ascetic]] practices of Cynicism were undoubtedly adopted by early [[Christians]], and Christians often employed the same [[rhetoric]]al methods as the Cynics.<ref>F. Gasco Lacalle, (1986) ''Cristianos y cinicos. Una tificacion del fenomeno cristiano durante el siglo II,'' pages 111<U+2013>119. Memorias de Historia Antigua 7.</ref> Some Cynics were actually martyred for speaking out against the authorities.<ref>Dio Cassius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/65*.html#p291 ''Epitome of book 65'', 15.5]; Herodian, [http://www.livius.org/he-hg/herodian/hre109.html  ''Roman History'', 1.9.2<U+2013>5]</ref> One Cynic, [[Peregrinus Proteus]], lived for a time as a Christian before converting to Cynicism,<ref>Lucian, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl4/wl420.htm ''De Morte Peregrini''], 10<U+2013>15</ref> whereas in the 4th century, [[Maximus the Cynic|Maximus of Alexandria]], although a Christian, was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle. Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty,<ref>Origen, ''adv. Cels.'' 2.41, 6.28, 7.7; Basil of Caesarea, ''Leg. Lib. Gent.'' 9.3, 4, 20; Theodoret, ''Provid.'' 6; John Chrysostom, ''Ad. Op. Vit. Monast.'' 2.4, 5</ref> although they scorned Cynic shamelessness: [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] stating that they had, "in violation of the modest instincts of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs."<ref>Augustine, {{ws|''[[s:The City of God/Book XIV/Chapter 20|De Civitate Dei'' 14.20]]''}}</ref> The ascetic orders of Christianity also had direct connection with the Cynics, as can be seen in the wandering [[mendicant]] monks of the early church who in outward appearance, and in many of their practices were little different from the Cynics of an earlier age.<ref name=dudley209>{{Harvnb|Dudley|1937|pp=209<U+2013>211}}</ref>
