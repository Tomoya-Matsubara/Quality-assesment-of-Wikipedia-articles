==Life and work==

Bacevich was born in Normal, Illinois, the son of Martha Ellen (Bulfer) and Andrew Bacevich.<ref>http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nwitimes/obituary.aspx?n=martha-ellen-greenis-bacevich&pid=154748279&fhid=8241</ref> His father was of [[Lithuania]]n descent and his mother was of Irish, German, and English ancestry.<ref>http://www.westpointcoh.org/westpointcoh/interview/navigating-an-ethical-critique-for-a-new-kind-of-war-in-iraq/print</ref> He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] in 1969 and served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]], serving in Vietnam from the summer of 1970 to the summer of 1971.  Later he held posts in Germany, including the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]]; the United States; and the Persian Gulf up to his retirement from the service with the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] in the early 1990s.  He holds a [[Ph.D.]] in American Diplomatic History from [[Princeton University]], and taught at [[West Point]] and [[Johns Hopkins University]] before joining the faculty at [[Boston University]] in 1998.

On May 13, 2007, Bacevich's son, 1LT Andrew John Bacevich, was killed in action in Iraq by an [[improvised explosive device]] south of Samarra in [[Salah ad Din Governorate]].<ref>[http://www.militarytimes.com/valor/army-1st-lt-andrew-j-bacevich/2758559 Honor the Fallen Army 1st Lt. Andrew J. Bacevich]</ref>  The younger Bacevich, 27, was a [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] in the U.S. Army,<ref name="soldier">"[http://www.eyewitnessnewstv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6514091&nav=F2DO Soldier from Fort Hood killed in Iraq]", The [[Associated Press]], published May 14, 2007, accessed May 15, 2007.</ref> assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 8th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division.

Bacevich also has three daughters.<ref name="soldier"/>

==Writings==
Bacevich has described himself as a "Catholic conservative" <ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2010/are-americans-god%E2%80%99s-chosen-people-2/ | work=BU Today | title=Are Americans God's Chosen People? | first=Rich | last=Barlow | date=November 22, 2010 | accessdate=February 18, 2013}}</ref> and initially published writings in a number of politically oriented magazines, including ''[[Wilson Quarterly|The Wilson Quarterly]]''.  His recent writings have professed a dissatisfaction with the [[George W. Bush Administration|Bush Administration]] and many of its intellectual supporters on matters of American [[foreign policy]].

On August 15, 2008, Bacevich appeared as the guest of [[Bill Moyers Journal]] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] to promote his book, ''The Limits of Power.''  As in both of his previous books, ''The Long War'' (2007) and ''The New American Militarism: How Americans are Seduced by War'' (2005), Bacevich is critical of American foreign policy in the post [[Cold War]] era, maintaining the United States has developed an over-reliance on military power, in contrast to diplomacy, to achieve its foreign policy aims. He also asserts that policymakers in particular, and the American people in general, overestimate the usefulness of military force in foreign affairs. Bacevich believes romanticized images of war in popular culture (especially movies) interact with the lack of actual military service among most of the U.S. population to produce in the American people a highly unrealistic, even dangerous notion of what combat and military service are really like.

Bacevich conceived ''The New American Militarism'' as "a corrective to what has become the conventional critique of U.S. policies since [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] but [also] as a challenge to the orthodox historical context employed to justify those policies."

Finally, he attempts to place current policies in historical context, as part of an American tradition going back to the Presidency of [[Woodrow Wilson]], a tradition (of an interventionist, militarized foreign policy) which has strong bi-partisan roots. To lay an intellectual foundation for this argument, he cites two influential historians from the 20th century: [[Charles A. Beard]] and [[William Appleman Williams]].

Ultimately, Bacevich eschews the partisanship of current debate about American foreign policy as short-sighted and ahistorical. Instead of blaming only one president (or his advisors) for contemporary policies, Bacevich sees both Republicans and Democrats as sharing responsibility for policies which may not be in the nation's best interest.

In March 2003, at the time of the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], Bacevich wrote in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' that "if, as seems probable, the effort encounters greater resistance than its architects imagine, our way of life may find itself tested in ways that will make the Vietnam War look like a mere blip in American history."<ref name=MacQuarrie/>

An editorial about the [[Bush Doctrine]] was published by the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' in March 2007.<ref name=Bacevich>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2007/03/01/rescinding_the_bush_doctrine/ |title=Rescinding the Bush Doctrine
|first=Andrew J. |last=Bacevich |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref>

In an article of  ''[[The American Conservative]]'' dated March 24, 2008, Bacevich depicts Democratic Presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] as the best choice for [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] in the fall. Part of his argument includes the fact that "this liberal Democrat has promised to end the U.S. combat role in Iraq. Contained within that promise, if fulfilled, lies some modest prospect of a conservative revival."<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.amconmag.com/2008/2008_03_24/article.html The Right Choice?]</ref> He also goes on to mention that "For conservatives to hope the election of yet another Republican will set things right is surely in vain. To believe that President John McCain will reduce the scope and intrusiveness of federal authority, cut the imperial presidency down to size, and put the government on a pay-as-you-go basis is to succumb to a great delusion."<ref name=autogenerated1/>

In the October 11, 2009, issue of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/10/11/afghanistan___the_proxy_war/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Afghanistan <U+2013> the proxy war | first=Andrew J. | last=Bacevich | date=October 11, 2009}}</ref> he wrote that the decision to commit more troops to Afghanistan may be the most fateful choice of the Obama administration. "If the Afghan war then becomes the consuming issue of Obama<U+2019>s presidency<U+2014>as Iraq became for his predecessor, as Vietnam did for Lyndon Johnson, and as Korea did for Harry Truman<U+2014>the inevitable effect will be to compromise the prospects of reform more broadly," Bacevich wrote.

In his article "Non Believer" in the  July 7, 2010, issue of ''[[The New Republic]]'', Bacevich compared President George W. Bush, characterized as wrong-headed but sincere, with President Obama, who, he says, has no belief in the Afghanistan war but pursues it for his own politically cynical reasons: "Who is more deserving of contempt? The commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause, however misguided, in which he sincerely believes? Or the commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause in which he manifestly does not believe and yet refuses to forsake?"<ref name="TNR01">Bacevich, Andrew, [http://www.tnr.com/blog/foreign-policy/76091/non-believer "Non-Believer"], ''The New Republic'', August 31, 2010 10:53 pm ET. Retrieved 2010-09-05. Referenced in [[Frank Rich]], [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/opinion/05rich.html "Freedom's just another word"], ''The New York Times'', September 4, 2010 (September 5, 2010 p. WK8, NY ed.).</ref>

In an October 2010 interview with ''[[Guernica Magazine]]'', Bacevich addressed his seemingly contradictory stance on Obama. While Bacevich supported Obama during the 2008 presidential race in which Obama repeatedly said he believed in the Afghanistan War, Bacevich has become increasingly critical of Obama's decision to commit additional troops to that war: "I interpreted his campaign rhetoric about Afghanistan as an effort to insulate him from the charge of being a national security wimp. His decision to escalate was certainly not a decision his supporters were clamoring for." <ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite news| url=http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/2062/bacevich_10_1_10/ | work=Guernica Magazine | title=Blood Without Guts | first=Andrew J. | last=Bacevich | date=October 1, 2010}}</ref>

Bacevich's papers are currently housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.
