[[Very Reverend|The Very Rev.]] '''George Fielden MacLeod, Baron MacLeod of Fuinary''', [[Military Cross|MC]] [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]] ([[June 17]], [[1895]] &ndash; [[June 27]], [[1991]]), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] soldier and clergyman; one of the best known, most influential and unconventional [[Church of Scotland]] [[Minister of religion|minister]]s of the 20th century. He was the founder of the [[Iona Community]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Glasgow]] in [[1895]]. His grandfather was the highly respected Revd Norman MacLeod of the [[Barony Church]], [[Glasgow]], a [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and Chaplain to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. His father (Sir John MacLeod) was a successful businessman before entering politics as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist]] MP; his mother Edith was from a wealthy [[Lancastrian]] family (owning cotton mills). From this background and heir to a baronetcy, George MacLeod was educated at [[Winchester School]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]].

==WW1 experiences==
Upon the outbreak of [[World War I]] in [[1914]] he joined the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], rising to the rank of [[Captain]]. He first saw active service in [[Greece]]. After falling ill with [[dysentery]], he was sent back to Scotland to recuperate, after which he was posted to [[Flanders]] and saw action at [[Ypres]] and [[Passchendaele]], for which he was awarded the [[Military Cross]] (MC) and the French [[Croix de Guerre]] for bravery. 

His experience of war profoundly affected him, leading him to train for the ministry. He studied divinity at the [[University of Edinburgh]], followed by a year at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], [[New York City]] (1921-1922). Upon return to Scotland he was invited to become Assistant at [[St Giles Cathedral]]. During this period his concern over social inequality became increasingly prominent. In [[1924]] he was ordained as a [[Church of Scotland]] minister, to be Padre of [[Toc H]] (Talbot House) in Scotland. Such non-parochial appointments were extremely unusual at the time. Following a disagreement, he resigned from [[Toc H]] in [[1926]], but was invited to become associate minister at [[St Cuthbert's Church]], [[Edinburgh]].

==The road to Iona==
His wartime experiences combined with a profound disillusionment by post-[[World War I]] political rhetoric of ''"a land fit for heroes"'' deeply affected him. Confronted by the realities of the depression and unemployment faced by those less privileged than himself he gradually moved towards [[socialism]] and [[pacificism]]. He would also later become actively involved with the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND). 

In [[1930]], to considerable surprise, he decided to leave St Cuthbert's to become minister at [[Govan Old Parish Church]] - encountering the considerable social problems caused by poverty in this part of Glasgow. The pace of work took its toll and in [[1932]] he suffered a [[breakdown]]. He spent some time recuperating in [[Jerusalem]] in early [[1933]]; worshipping in an [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] on [[Easter Day]] he felt a profound spiritual experience, feeling a sense of recovery of the Church as the corporate [[Body of Christ]]. This would strongly influence the rest of his life. 

He resigned (giving up the financial security of a [[parish]] minister's [[stipend]]) to become the full-time leader of the [[Iona Community]], which he founded in 1938. The idea of rebuilding [[Iona Abbey]] using ministers, students and unemployed labourers working together influenced his thinking; the [[Iona Community]] grew into an international [[ecumenical]] community, with offices in [[Govan]] and a presence on the Isle of [[Iona]].

==Later life==
During [[World War II]], he served as [[locum]] minister at [[Canongate Kirk]] in Edinburgh - a parish also then afflicted by [[poverty]].

In 1948 (aged 53) he married Lorna; immediately after the wedding they travelled to [[Australia]] for a preaching tour. The 1940s and early 1950s were a difficult period professionally which became known as the "Govan Case"; when George was invited to return to [[Govan Old Parish Church]] in 1948 the Presbytery of Glasgow refused to approve his appointment, given his wish to continue his active leadership of the Iona Community. The case was referred to the General Assembly, ultimately he was refused permission to combine the two posts.

Despite a feeling of hurt and rejection over the "Govan Case", George MacLeod remained one of the highest profile figures in the [[Church of Scotland]]. In [[1957]] he was elected [[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]]. 

In [[1967]] he was awarded a [[peerage]], becoming Lord MacLeod of Fuinary - the only Church of Scotland minister to have been thus honoured. 

George MacLeod's influence on the [[Church of Scotland]] was considerable. Although dismissed by some as a maverick, he helped to raise awareness of [[ecumenism]] and [[social justice]] issues, and inspired many to become involved with such questions. Through the creation of the [[Iona Community]] he was a pioneer of new forms of ministry (outside more conventional parish or [[chaplain]]cy structures.)
