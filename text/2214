'''Hotel Moskva''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: '''<U+0425><U+043E><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B> <U+041C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+0432><U+0430>'''; {{lang-en|'''Hotel Moscow'''}}), is one of the oldest still operating hotels in [[Belgrade]] but also in the entire [[Serbia]]. Apart from being a hotel, Hotel Moskva is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Belgrade, a valuable architectural monument and as such, it was placed under governmental protection.

== Location ==

Hotel Moskva is located on the [[Terazije]] square, core of Belgrade's downtown. It lies on the crossroads of three streets: Terazije, ''Prizrenska'' and ''Balkanska''. Location on top of [[Terazijska Terasa]] provides a wonderful skyline view of [[Novi Beograd]], across the [[Sava]] river. Apart from other commercial buildings in the vicinity, two other hotels, "Balkan" and "Kasina", are located right across ''Prizrenska'' street and Terazije, respectively, so as the [[Palace Albania]] and the Terazije fountain, built in 1860, which is the administratively declared center of Belgrade.

== History ==

[[File:Hotel Moscou.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Hotel Moskva]]

The inn "Velika Srbija" was previously located on the lot where hotel is today. Hotel Moskva itself was built in 1906 and open on January 16, 1908. The importance it had even at that time can bee seen as it was personally open by the [[King of Serbia]], [[Peter I Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evi<U+0107>]]. <ref>[[Politika]] daily, January 22, 2008, p. 23</ref> Hotel was built with the [[Russia]]n capital, hence the name. Soon after it was opened, [[Olympic Committee of Serbia]] and Club of the journalists and writers moved in. In 1923 Postal Savings Bank took over the hotel, which in turn was taken over by the [[National Bank of Yugoslavia]] in 1938. During [[World War II]], [[Gestapo]] moved into the hotel in 1941, transforming it into its headquarters, and renamed it to ''Velika Srbija'', after the original inn. The headquarter had its own power generators and water sources and was one of the last buildings liberated at the end of war. During German withdrawal in 1944, original master's paintings, [[silver (household)|silverware]] and gold-plated [[utensils]] which were in the hotel were looted and taken away. In the post war period, it became a favorite place of the cultural elite. [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] [[Nobel laureate]] in literature, [[Ivo Andri<U+0107>]], had his own table at the restaurant, and poet [[Vasko Popa]] was a regular visitor.

== Architecture ==

Hotel was designed by the architect [[Jovan Ilki<U+0107>]], in [[Vienna Secession|Secessionist]] style, quite daring for that time, giving Belgrade a modern face during the transformation it was undergoing at the turn of the century. The most impressive feature, even at the first glance, is the smooth and shiny fa<U+00E7>ade, made of ceramic tiles. Originally, it had 36 rooms, but after many renovations, today it has 132 rooms (of those 40 [[duplex]] rooms) and 6 apartments.
