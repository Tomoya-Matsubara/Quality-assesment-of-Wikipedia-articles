{{Peerage|Types}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], '''representative peers''' were those [[Peerage|peers]] elected by the members of the [[Peerage of Scotland]] and the [[Peerage of Ireland]] to sit in the British [[House of Lords]]. At this time, all members of the [[Peerage of England]] held the right to sit in the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as [[Peerage of Great Britain|Peers of Great Britain]] and after 1801 as [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|Peers of the United Kingdom]] held the same right to sit in the House of Lords.

Representative peers were introduced in 1707, when the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] were united into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. At the time, there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers.<ref name=nicholls>{{cite web |author=Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldselect/ldprivi/108i/10806.htm |title=Opinions of the Committee |work=Select Committee on Privileges Second Report |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently the election of a small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated.<ref name=nicholls/> A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] merged into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] in January 1801. 

Scotland was allowed to elect sixteen representative peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight.<ref name="May p228">{{cite book |last=May |first=Erskine |authorlink=Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough |title=The Constitutional History of England since the Accession of George III 1760<U+2013>1860 |publisher=Crosby & Nichols |year=1862 |location=Boston |page=228 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0nQRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA228}}</ref> Those chosen by Scotland sat for a single term, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the [[Irish Free State]] came into existence as a [[Dominion]] in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued to be entitled to sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.

Under the 1999 [[House of Lords Act]], a new form of representative peer was introduced to allow some hereditary peers to stay in the House of Lords.<ref name="types of member"/>

Under articles XXII and XXIII of the [[Act of Union 1707|Act of Union]] of 1707, Scottish peers were entitled to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords.<ref name="May treatise on law"/><ref name="Price">{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Jacob M |title=The Sixteen Peers of Scotland: An Account of the Elections of the Representative Peers of Scotland, 1707<U+2013>1959 by James Fergusson |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 1961 |page=439 |doi=10.1086/238935 }}</ref> Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments.

The [[Plurality-at-large voting|block voting]] system was used, with each peer casting as many votes as there were seats to be filled. The system, however, permitted the party with the greatest number of peers, normally the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writs of summons]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990429/text/90429-16.htm |title=House of Lords Hansard for 29 Apr 1999 (pt 16) |work=House of Lords Hansard |volume=600 |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref>

The position and rights of Scottish peers in relation to the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, [[James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton|The 4th Duke of Hamilton]], a peer of Scotland, was made [[Duke of Brandon]] in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity.<ref name="debrett p358">{{cite book |last=Debrett |first=John |authorlink=John Debrett |title=Debrett's Peerage of England, Scotland, and Ireland |publisher=J.

Under the [[Peerage Act 1963]], all Scottish peers procured the right to sit in the House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished.<ref name="Peerage Act 1963">{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldselect/ldprivi/108i/10820.htm |title=Peerage Act 1963 |publisher=The Committee Office, House of Lords |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> Scottish as well as British and English [[hereditary peer]]s lost their automatic right to sit in the Upper House with the passage of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]].

It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act of 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld.<ref name="Slynn" /><ref name="case for the Lord Gray">{{cite web |author=Richard S.

[[File:Holyrood from Calton Hill by James Valentine. 1878 or earlier..jpg|thumb|Scottish representative peers were chosen in the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]]]]

Counsel for the Government held a different view. It was noted that the Peerage Act 1963 explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been, or at least purportedly, repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. It was further asserted by the Government that Article XXII could be repealed because it had not been [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]]. Examples of entrenched provisions are numerous: England and Scotland were united "forever",<ref>{{cite web |title=Treaty of Union 1707 |work=The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707 |publisher=School of History at the University of St Andrews |year=1706 |url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1706/10/257 |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> the [[Court of Session]] was to remain "in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldselect/ldprivi/108i/10813.htm |title=Union With England Act 1707 |publisher=The Committee Office, House of Lords |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> and the establishment of the [[Church of Scotland]] was "effectually and unalterably secured".<ref name="case for HMG">{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldselect/ldprivi/108i/10811.htm |title=Appendix 3 'Case for Her Majesty's Government' |work=Select Committee on Privileges Second Report |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> Article XXII, however, did not include any words of entrenchment, making it "fundamental or unalterable in all time coming".<ref>{{cite web |author=Hector L.

Further, the Government pointed out that, even if the election of Scottish peers were entrenched, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] could amend the provision under the doctrine of [[Parliamentary sovereignty]]. Though the position of the Church of Scotland was "unalterably" secured, the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1853]] repealed the requirement that professors declare their faith before assuming a position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldselect/ldprivi/108i/10812.htm |title=Union with Scotland Act 1706 |work=Select Committee on Privileges Second Report |publisher=The Committee Office, House of Lords |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> In [[Ireland]], the [[Church of Ireland]] was entirely disestablished in 1869,<ref>{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=Jocelyn |title=Britain, 1846<U+2013>1919 |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |page=225}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Evan |first=Anna Laura |title=The disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1869 |location=Lancaster |publisher=James & Naomi |year=1929}}</ref> though the Articles of Union with Ireland had clearly entrenched the establishment of that body. In December 1922, the Union with most of Ireland was dissolved upon the creation of the [[Irish Free State]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/8B9125171CFBA78080256DE5004011F8?opendocument |title=Early Irish Law and Brehon law |publisher=Courts Service of Ireland |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> though [[Great Britain]] and all of Ireland were supposedly united "forever." It was therefore suggested that Parliament could, if it pleased, repeal an Article of Union as well amend as any underlying principle.

The Privileges Committee unanimously found that the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted.<ref name="case for HMG"/> The bill did receive [[Royal Assent]], and from 1999, hereditary peers have not had the automatic right to sit in Parliament.<ref>{{cite web |title=Different types of Lords |work=About Parliament |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-types/ |accessdate=21 January 2013}}</ref>

The Clerk of the Crown in Ireland was responsible for electoral arrangements; each peer voted by an open and public ballot. The results of the first election were announced by the Clerk of the Crown and published in both ''[[The Dublin Gazette]]'' and ''[[The London Gazette]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Finnelly |first=William |title=The Law and Practice of Elections in England, Scotland, and Ireland |publisher=A.

[[Ireland]] was further represented in the House of Lords by four [[Lords Spiritual]], who sat in rotation for terms lasting one session each.

Following the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, [[Francis Needham, 4th Earl of Kilmorey|The 4th Earl of Kilmorey]] (a peer from an [[Ulster]] family), died in 1961.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gadd |first=R.P. |title=A short account of the peerage of Ireland |publisher=[[The Heraldry Society]] |url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/articles/ireland/peerage_of_ireland.htm |accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref> Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the [[Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922]] had abolished the office of [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]],<ref>{{cite web |author=Brigid Hadfield |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/constitutional/support/ci_c021.shtml |title=The Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the Act of Union |publisher=BBC NI |year=1998 |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans.<ref name="Lysaght">{{cite web |last=Lysaght |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Lysaght |title=The Irish Peers and the House of Lords |work=106th Edition |publisher=Burke's Peerage & Baronetage |year=1999 |url=http://www.burkes-peerage.net/articles/ireland/page93.aspx |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110716064928/http://www.burkespeerage.com/articles/ireland/page93.aspx |archivedate=2013-02-11 |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> In the next year, when the [[Peerage Act 1963]] (which, among other things, gave all peers in the [[Peerage of Scotland]] the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], and to vote at parliamentary elections.<ref name="Peerage Act 1963">{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1963/48/enacted |title=Peerage Act 1963 |publisher=National Archives of the United Kingdom |date=31 July 2967 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>

In 1965, [[Earl of Antrim|The 8th Earl of Antrim]] (another peer from [[Ulster]]) and other Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords, arguing that the right to elect representative peers had never been formally abolished. The House of Lords ruled against the Irish peers. [[James Reid, Baron Reid|Lord Reid]], a [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]], based his ruling on the Act of Union, which stated that representative peers sat "on the part of Ireland."<ref name="Lysaght" /> He reasoned that, since the island had been divided into the Irish Free State and [[Northern Ireland]], there was no such political entity called "Ireland" which the representative peers could be said to represent. Lord Reid wrote, "A statutory provision is impliedly repealed if a later enactment brings to an end a state of things the continuance of which is essential for its operation."<ref>{{cite web |author=Brigid Hadfield |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/learning/history/stateapart/agreement/constitutional/support/ci_c022.shtml |title=The Belfast Agreement, Sovereignty and the State of the Union |publisher=BBC NI |year=1998 |accessdate=7 April 2007}}</ref> In contrast, [[Richard Wilberforce, Baron Wilberforce|Lord Wilberforce]], another Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, disagreed that a major enactment such as the Act of Union could be repealed by implication.<ref name="Lysaght" /> He argued instead on the basis that the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Irish Free State Act 1921]]<U+2014>which was silent on the election of representative peers<U+2014>abolished the posts of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Clerk of the Crown in Ireland. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland was responsible for calling elections of representative peers, and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland was responsible for sending peers their ballots. Since these offices had been abolished; Lord Wilberforce argued against any mechanism by which Irish peers could be elected. Here too, the petitioners lost.<ref name="Lysaght"/>

The petitioners failed to raise the status of [[Northern Ireland]] as part of the United Kingdom. ''[[Burke's Peerage|Burke's Peerage & Baronetage]]'' suggests that if this fact had been foremost, Lord Wilberforce's arguments relating to the removal of the electoral mechanism for the election could be rebutted, as the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland did have replacements in Northern Ireland. The reason for excluding the arguments relating to Northern Ireland from the petition "was that leading counsel for the petitioning Irish peers was convinced that the members of the Committee for Privileges were with him on what he considered was his best argument and did not want to alienate them by introducing another point."<ref name="Lysaght" /> To prevent further appeals on the matter, [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] repealed, as a part of the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1971, the sections of the Acts of Union relating to the election of Irish representative peers.<ref name="Lysaght" />
