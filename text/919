'''Ray Clay''' is an [[United States|American]] [[public address]] [[announcer]] best known for his work for the [[Chicago Bulls]] organization in the [[1990s]].

==Chicago Bulls==
A native of [[Berwyn, Illinois]], Clay began announcing basketball games at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] in [[1980]].  He was hired by the Bulls in [[1990]] and worked with them for 12 <U+00BD> seasons, during which the team won six [[NBA Finals|NBA Championships]].  With the rising popularity of the team, many traditions Clay adopted from his predecessor, [[Tommy Edwards (announcer)|Tommy Edwards]], became known worldwide, including the opening address to the fans (<U+201C>Aaaaand now...the starting lineup...for your...Chicago Bulls!<U+201D>) the distinctive player introductions (e.g., <U+201C>Frommmm [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]]...at [[guard (basketball)|guard]]...6<U+2019>6"...[[Michael Jordan]]!<U+201D>), and the use of the [[The Alan Parsons Project]] song "Sirius" as background music for the introductions.

Clay<U+2019>s fame during the height of the Bulls success led to a minor [[actor|acting]] career.  For example, he guest starred in a [[1993]] [[A Tisket, a Tasket, Can Peg Make a Basket?|episode]] of the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Married... with Children]]'' and appeared in the films ''[[Blink (film)|Blink]]'' and ''[[He Got Game]]''.  In addition, he lent his vocal talents to several basketball [[video game]]s and read the "[[Top 10 list|Top Ten]]" on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in [[1998]].<ref>"Late Show With David Letterman #1141" [http://www.tv.com/late-show-with-david-letterman/show-1141/episode/124096/summary.html http://www.tv.com/late-show-with-david-letterman/show-1141/episode/124096/summary.html]. </ref>

==[[2002]] dismissal==
In January 2002, Michael Jordan was scheduled to return to the [[United Center]] for the first time since leaving the Bulls in [[1999]].  Jordan was then playing for the rival [[Washington Wizards]], and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] asked Clay how he was going to introduce the ex-Bull.  Clay explained that he wanted to deliver his familiar introduction for Jordan, but team management had ordered him to introduce Jordan as he would any other opposing player.  After the conversation went into print, the Bulls allegedly reprimanded him for his comments.<ref name = A>Mariotti, Jay. <U+201C>Tired tactics need no introduction<U+201D>. ''Chicago Sun-Times''. May 15, 2002.</ref>  

Clay was suddenly fired in May of that year.  The Bulls gave no official reason for Clay<U+2019>s dismissal, but Clay speculated he was fired because of his disagreement with team management over Jordan<U+2019>s introduction.  <U+201C>When you put two and two together, that<U+2019>s all it could be.  I can<U+2019>t think of anything else I ever did wrong,<U+201D> he told Mariotti.<ref name = A>Mariotti, Jay. <U+201C>Tired tactics need no introduction<U+201D>. ''Chicago Sun-Times''. May 15, 2002.</ref>

In April [[2003]], Clay accepted an invitation to introduce Jordan at the [[Wachovia Center|First Union Center]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], where Jordan played his last game in the NBA.<ref>Wyche, Steve. <U+201C>The Air Finally Runs Out<U+201D>.

==Current work==
Clay currently works full-time as Director of Campus Recreation at UIC.  He also announces games for the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]<U+2019>s [[Chicago Sky]], who play their home games at the [[UIC Pavilion]].
