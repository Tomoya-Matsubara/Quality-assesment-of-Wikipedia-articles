'''Playtex''' is a product brand owned by Playtex Marketing Corp. and leased to several companies that sell Playtex-branded products. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]] has exclusive rights to the Playtex brand for bras, panties and [[Foundation garment|shapewear]] in Europe and South Africa, while a [[HanesBrands]] subsidiary sells Playtex apparel in the rest of the world. Playtex Products LLC, which is owned by Energizer Holdings, sells Playtex-branded baby cups, gloves, [[tampon]]s and other consumer products. Prior to 1988 all Playtex-branded products were sold by a single company.

Playtex was founded as International Latex Corporation (ILC), which started out making infants' [[rubber pants]] in the 1930s, before expanding into women's girdles. After World War II, ILC resumed production and created Playtex as one of four divisions. Playtex established the use of standard sizes for undergarments, while previously they were custom-tailored. The company was the first to advertise undergarments on national television in 1955. Twenty-two years later, it was also the first to take advantage of relaxed regulations by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]], when it showed a live model wearing a bra in a commercial. 

During the 1960s, [[tampon]]s and infant-care products bearing the Playtex brand were introduced, making Playtex the primary competitor to [[Tampax]] in the tampon [[Economic sector|sector]]. Playtex also introduced the plastic tampon applicator. In 1962, before Playtex's industrial division spun-off into [[ILC Dover]], it helped create the latex components of the spacesuits used in the Apollo mission. From 1969 to the 1990s, [[chief executive officer]] Joel Smilow led the company through a series of acquisitions and sales. Playtex was acquired by [[Esmark]] in 1975, and then by [[Beatrice Foods]] in 1985. A year later an investor group led by Smilow bought Playtex for $1.25 billion. Its cosmetics brands were sold to [[Revlon]] to fund the acquisition.

In 1988, Smilow split Playtex into two companies in a $1.3 billion transaction that bought out some of Playtex's other investors and put ownership into two separate investment firms operated by Smilow. In 1991, Playtex Apparel Inc., was sold to [[Sara Lee Corporation]], which became part of [[Energizer Holdings]] in 2007. Several of Sara Lee's brands, including Playtex Apparel, were spun-off into [[HanesBrands]].

===Recent history===

Playtex Products continued to erode Tampax's' [[market share]] throughout the late 20th century.

In 1997 [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), makers of [[Always (brand)|Always]] [[sanitary napkins]] and [[pantiliner]]s, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling [[Rely (brand)|Rely]] from the market over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.<ref name="Houppert The Curse">{{cite book|last=Houppert|first=Karen|title=The Curse: Confronting the Last Unmentionable Taboo: Menstruation|year=2000|publisher=MacMillan|isbn=9781466813960|pages=39<U+2013>43|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6IlCwf5BgJ0C&pg=PA39}}</ref>

Due to its strong advantage among younger women, and [[baby boomer]]s reaching [[menopause]], Playtex continued to gain market share on Tampax. After extensive [[market research]], Tampax reversed that trend with the 2002 introduction of Pearl, with an applicator designed to be as visually appealing as it was functional, and making the brand once again appealing to teens.<ref name="The Game Changer">{{cite book|title=The Game Changer: How Every Leader Can Drive Everyday Innovation|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781847651365|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=auCt2-LPnLkC&pg=PA1975|author=Lafley, A.G.|coauthors=Sharan, Ram|accessdate=May 1, 2013}}</ref>  

Playtex responded by [[litigation|litigating]].
