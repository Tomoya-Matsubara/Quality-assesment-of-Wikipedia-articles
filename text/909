'''Cleveland Street''' in [[central London]] runs north to south from [[Euston Road]] ([[A501 road|A501]]) to the junction of Mortimer Street and Goodge Street. It lies within  [[Fitzrovia]], in the [[W postcode area|W1]] post code area.  Cleveland Street also runs along part of the border between [[Bloomsbury (ward)]] which is located in [[London Borough of Camden]], and [[West End (ward)]] and [[Marylebone]] High Street (ward) in the [[City of Westminster]].<ref>http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/fmn/index3.cfm?FMNstreet=Cleveland%20Street&LayerID=55 Area Ward Boundaries for Cleveland Street</ref>

Cleveland Street marks the border between the [[City of Westminster]] to its west and the [[London Borough of Camden]] to the east. This border is ancient, largely following the old divide between the western parish of [[Saint Marylebone]] and the parish of [[St Pancras, London|Saint Pancras]] to the east and can be traced back as far as 1792.<ref>[http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/horwoodpages/horwoodmain.html Horwood Map](1792-1799)</ref> The street was also a boundary between large estates, such as the [[Bedford Estate]] and the Berners Estate.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46086 ''Survey of London: volume 36: Covent Garden''] (1970), pp. 34-37</ref> Maps show that the southern end of modern Cleveland Street, beyond Riding House Street, was known as Upper Newman Street and then Norfolk Street. The northern section was once known as Upper Cleveland Street and Buckingham Place.<ref>[http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/horwoodpages/horwoodmain.html Horwood Map](1792-1799), Peter Potter Map (1832), George Lucas Map of Maylebone (1846), Map of the Parish of St. Marylebone (1832) at [http://www.oldlondonmaps.com/horwoodpages/horwoodmain.html Westminster City Archives]</ref> 

The name comes from the [[Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland]] whose estate was connected in the 19th century with the Southampton (Wriothesley) property <ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=65152 Survey ''of London: volume 21: The parish of St Pancras part 3: Tottenham Court Road & neighbourhood''] (1949), pp. 1-6</ref> via [[Henry Fitzroy, 1st Duke of Grafton]]. The Southampton property later  became the Bedford Estate.
Cleveland Street is renowned for several historical events and buildings, the most notable recent one being  the [[BT Tower]].

== History ==

The [[Cleveland Street Scandal]] happened in 1889 at 19 Cleveland Street (now demolished) which at the time housed a male [[brothel]] in which teenage telegraph boys served as prostitutes.<ref>Theo Aronson, ''Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld'' (1994) pp. 8<U+2013>10 and Montgomery Hyde, ''The Cleveland Street Scandal'' (1976), pp. 20<U+2013>23</ref> The scandal allegedly involved [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale]], heir to the throne of England.<ref>Lees Milne, ''Harold Nicolson'' (1980-81), pp.231</ref> A show inspired by the [[Cleveland Street scandal]] and titled Cleveland Street The Musical - with book and lyrics by [[Glenn Chandler]] - is scheduled to run in London between April and May 2011. 

In his book [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]], [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]] mentions Cleveland Street in conjunction with two houses in the street. According to Knight's theory, the royal family was connected with the [[Jack The Ripper]] murders from 1888, via the same [[Prince Albert Victor]] who he claims met his later wife, Catholic prostitute Annie Elizabeth Crook, at the studio of the painter [[Walter Sickert]] at  15 Cleveland Street. After their secret wedding, Annie Elizabeth Crook was allegedly settled in an apartment at  6 Cleveland Street.<ref>Stephhen Knight, ''Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution'' (1976), pp. 22<U+2013>28</ref>  The conspiracy theory behind the murders described in Knight's book has been loosely adapted into [[From Hell]] (1999), a [[graphic novel]] by Alan Moore from which a [[From Hell (film)|movie]] with the same title was adapted in 2001. Several scenes in the movie take place in Cleveland Street, although they were not shot on location.<ref>Internet Movie Database, [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/locations ''From Hell'' Locations]</ref>

* 151 (George and Dragon corner [[public house]] c.1850 rebuild or recasting)

* The [[BT Tower]] complex. The tower was London tallest building when it was completed in 1960 and it remains a major [[List of structures in London|London landmark]], being currently the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London|8th tallest building]] in London at 177 metres plus a 12 metre antenna.<ref>SkyscraperPage.com -[http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6765. http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6765 ''BT Tower'']</ref>

*The frontage building of the former [[Cleveland Street workhouse]] later Middlesex Hospital annexe and outpatient department on the eastern side of the street at 44 <ref>Workhouses.org, [http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Strand/Strand.shtml ''Strand Union Workhouse'']</ref> c.1776. Over the years from 1778 until 2005 the building operated as a workhouse then a workhouse infirmary and more recently as a hospital.  UCLH NHS Foundation Trust in 2010 proposed the building's demolition in a planning application (and conservation area consent) submitted to [[Camden London Borough Council]] to replace it with a large building mixing private accommodation with commercial space.<ref>Camden Council, [http://planningrecords.camden.gov.uk/Northgate/PlanningExplorer17/Generic/StdDetails.aspx?PT=Planning%20Applications%20On-Line&TYPE=PL/PlanningPK.xml&PARAM0=225694&XSLT=/Northgate/PlanningExplorer17/SiteFiles/Skins/camden/xslt/PL/PLDetails.xslt&FT=Planning%20Application%20Details&PUBLIC=Y&XMLSIDE=/Northgate/PlanningExplorer17/SiteFiles/Skins/camden/Menus/PL.xml&DAURI=PLANNING ''Details Page for Planning Application - 2010/2205/P'']</ref><ref>Camden Council, [http://planningrecords.camden.gov.uk/Northgate/PlanningExplorer17/Generic/StdDetails.aspx?PT=Planning_Applications_On-Line&TYPE=PL/PlanningPK.xml&PARAM0=225714&XSLT=/Northgate/PlanningExplorer17/SiteFiles/Skins/camden/xslt/PL/PLDetails.xslt&FT=Planning_Application_Details&PUBLIC=Y&XMLSIDE=/Northgate/PlanningExplorer17/SiteFiles/Skins/camden/Menus/PL.xml&DAURI=PLANNING ''Details Page for Planning Application - 2010/2209/C'']</ref> However adjoining [[Westminster City Council]] objected on three grounds on 2 December 2010.<ref>Westminster City Council, [http://idoxpa.westminster.gov.uk/online-applications/files/F03FD32DD1F541CEE9C8C07B8F6125D7/pdf/10_07581_OBS--1988770.pdf ''Decision document'']
1. The City Council considers that the existing building is a heritage asset which makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area.  The proposed development would not preserve or enhance this character and appearance.  The City Council considers that retention and refurbishment of all or a substantial part of the existing building should be pursued.<br></br>
2. The proposals provide insufficient on-street car parking facilities for the development, particularly for the private housing market which would generate significant car parking demand.  This would increase the pressure for car parking on surrounding streets to the detriment of highway safety and convenience.<br></br>
3. The submitted Daylight, Sunlight and Shadow study shows that the proposed development would result in unacceptable losses of daylight for some of the residential properties on Cleveland Street which face the application site.  This would be materially harmful to the local residential environment and lead to an unacceptable reduction in the quality of residential amenity.

The [[Cleveland Street Workhouse]]<ref>http://www.clevelandstreetworkhouse.org/</ref> is of particular importance in light of the fact that [[Charles Dickens]] is known to have lived nearby in what is now 22 Cleveland Street.  Dickens lived there as a young child between 1815<U+2013>1816 and then again as a teenager between 1828-1831. His residence in the street has led to the suggestion that the nearby workhouse was probably the inspiration for [[Oliver Twist]].<ref>Lorna Bradbury (20 January 2011) "[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/8271265/Oliver-Twists-Workhouse-Discovered.html ''Oliver Twist's Workhouse Discovered'']", The Telegraph</ref>

Cleveland Street hosted the [[Middlesex Hospital]], closed in 2005 and since demolished. The hospital occupied an entire block on the western side of the southern section of the street. The future of this site is currently uncertain, despite its sale by nationalised Icelandic [[Kaupthing Bank]] to [[Aviva Investors]] and Exemplar Properties.<ref>Deirdre Hipwell (18 July 2010), "[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/aviva-wins-noho-square-scheme-2029070.html ''Aviva wins Noho Square scheme'']", Independent on Sunday</ref>

Cleveland Street was described as an area of special architectural and historic interest when it was designated a [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]] on 20 November 1990.<ref>Department of Planning and City Development, Westminster City Council, Cleveland Street Conservation Area Audit,11 April 2006, available on http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Cleveland%20Street%20CAA%20SPG.pdf Date accessed 14/12/2010</ref> Anomalously on its Camden side Cleveland Street is part of two conservation areas: the [[Fitzroy Square]] conservation area,<ref>[http://www.camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/environment/planning-and-built-environment/conservation-and-design/conservation-areas/download-conservation-area-appraisals-and-management-strategies.en?page=8 ''Fitzroy Square conservation area appraisal and management plan''], adopted 16 March 2010
