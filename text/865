'''Route 20''', known locally as '''McLean Boulevard''', is a [[state highway]] that runs 4.15 miles (6.68&nbsp;km) in [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. It runs along the east side of [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic County]], following the west bank of the [[Passaic River]] between [[U.S. Route 46]] and River Street ([[County Route 504 (New Jersey)|County Route 504]]), at which point County Route 504 begins. It is a four- to six-lane [[divided highway]] most of its length that runs through residential and commercial areas of Paterson, intersecting with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]] and [[New Jersey Route 4|Route 4]] at interchanges. The northernmost part of the route is a county-maintained [[one-way pair]] that follows 1st and 2nd Avenues.

== Route description ==
Route 20 begins at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 46]] and County Route 630 (Crooks Avenue) just north of the Garden State Parkway on the border of Clifton and Paterson. The road follows the bend of the [[Passaic River]] directly north of Dundee Lake, heading to the north into Paterson as McLean Boulevard, a four-lane [[divided highway]] with a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed limit.<ref name="sld"/> The route runs in between the Passaic River to the east and two large cemeteries to the west before coming to an interchange with [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]] and Market Street. Past Interstate 80, Route 20 becomes a six-lane divided highway that heads through a mix of residential and commercial areas.<ref name="sld"/><ref name=gm>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=route+46+and+roosevelt+avenue+elmwood+park,+nj&daddr=first+avenue+and+river+street+paterson,+nj&geocode=&hl=en&mra=ls&rtol=1&sll=40.892802,-74.123769&sspn=0.007218,0.013733&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=13 |title=overview of New Jersey Route 20 |accessdate=2009-03-11}}</ref> 

The next interchange along the route is for [[New Jersey Route 4|Route 4]] (Broadway), with access to both eastbound Route 4 and westbound Broadway from both directions.<ref name="sld"/> The road continues further north as a four-lane divided highway with a speed limit of {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, heading through more urbanized areas of Paterson. It crosses County Route 651 (East 33rd Street/Morlot Avenue), which crosses the Passaic River to become County Route 78 (Morlot Avenue) in Bergen County.<ref name="sld"/><ref name=gm/> 

Route 20 continues to follow the Passaic River as a {{convert|45|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} road through commercial areas, featuring an intersection with County Route 652 (5th Avenue). Past this intersection, the route proceeds through urban areas, turning west and splitting into a [[one-way pair]]. Here, the route becomes county maintained, with the northbound direction following 1st Avenue and the southbound direction following 2nd Avenue before coming to an end at [[County Route 504 (New Jersey)|County Route 504]] (River Street).<ref name="sld"/><ref name=gm/>

[[File:NJ 20 overhead sign.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Overhead sign for Route 20.]]The present-day routing of Route 20 north of Market Street was legislated in 1927 as part of [[New Jersey Route 3|Route 3]], which was to run from the [[New York]] border at [[Greenwood Lake]] to [[Secaucus, New Jersey|Secaucus]].<ref name=nj1927>State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319.</ref><ref name="Map">{{cite web|author= Williams, Jimmy and Sharon |url=http://www.jimmyandsharonwilliams.com/njroads/1920s/images/1927_routes.gif|title=1927 New Jersey Road Map|publisher= 1920s New Jersey Highways|
