'''''The Remix Album''''' was released in 1998 after the success [[All Saints (album)|All Saints]] debut album and features remixes of the songs most of which had not been published before and was one of the first remix-only albums by established artists. The reason for the release is unclear, but it is probably related to the fact that All Saints loved to remix their song or have it remixed with other DJs and after the chart success of "[[Never Ever]]" the first priority was a world-wide tour which meant that the next album wasn't due for some time. Surprisingly the album did quite well in Australia despite being a release for a limited audience. [[Pete Tong]] was responsible for the mix which he selected from promo singles and limited edition singles. In some cases the remixes have been edited in order to release 15 remixes on one album.
