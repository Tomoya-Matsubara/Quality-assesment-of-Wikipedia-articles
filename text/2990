==Controversies==
===Alleged bias===
In mid-2003, [[GMA Network]], the chief rival of SkyCable's sister company [[ABS-CBN]], accused SkyCable of purposely tampering with the signal of GMA received by SkyCable's subscribers. At that time, SkyCable changed its channel listing, moving GMA to channel 14. Subscribers received poor reception of GMA, but officals at SkyCable denied these claims. <ref>http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/may/12/ent_5-1.htm</ref> The National Telecommunications Commission ordered SkyCable to move GMA to an appropriate channel. <ref>http://www.inq7.net/ent/2003/sep/01/text/ent_1-1-p.htm</ref> SkyCable complied with the order and moved GMA to Channel 12 on the system.<ref>http://www.inq7.net/brk/2003/dec/10/text/brkpol_4-1-p.htm</ref> 

Even so, some subscribers have complained still about GMA's weak signal on 12, especially in timeslots where GMA's ratings are relatively high. In response, GMA provides a telephone line where subscribers can complain to GMA about the signal quality. The phone line has been promoted during newscasts, and is being used to collect evidence in preparation for a formal complaint against SkyCable.

===Removal of Solar Entertainment's Channels===
<!--Please add proper references for this section. Refrain from using Forums, Blogs, Streaming Sites as a source because they are not reliable. Please cooperate with us in keeping the order and truthfulness of this site.-->

Due to a dispute with SkyCable, channels owned by [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]] will be removed from SkyCable's lineups on [[January 1st]], [[2008]]. The channels will be "replaced" by several new channels - [[AXN Beyond]], [[Fox Crime]], [[Balls (Channel)|Balls]], [[MAXXX]] and [[Velvet TV]].

[[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]] responded to the move by starting to air programs on [[Associated Broadcasting Company|Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC)]] and [[DZRJ-TV|RJTV 29]], apart from [[Radio Philippines Network|Radio Philippines Network (RPN)]], which already airs Solar's programs. One insider commented that it was the best move, while another claimed that the troubles started when [[Manny Pacquiao]], whose matches Solar Entertainment has exclusive rights to air and distribute, switched his loyalties from ABS-CBN to GMA. However, the said move, according to SkyCable's vice president for Programming Juno Chuidian, was just part of the thrust to improve programming and reduce redundant programs.<ref>{{Citation | last =San Diego | first =Bayani Jr. | title = Solar joins ABC 5, RJTV | newspaper = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]| pages = E4 | date =[[November 22]] [[2007]] | url = http://archive.inquirer.net/view.php?db=1&story_id=102344}}</ref>

==Competition==
SkyCable competes with many cable TV providers in Metro Manila, some only operating in a certain locale in Metro Manila. But SkyCable's major competitor is [[Global Destiny Cable]], which also operates metrowide. Both have their own affiliates nationwide, and both provide their own [[cable internet]] services to subscribers. However, the market for Global Destiny Cable is now vastly different from that of SkyCable, considering that it now focuses more on Asian shows than the predominantly English programming still adopted by SkyCable to this day. It is therefore safe to assume that the two cable giants are no longer in direct competition with each other.

Another major competitor in the Philippine [[pay TV]] industry was [[Dream Satellite TV]], the country's first and only [[satellite TV]] provider. It operates nationwide since it transmits its signals to its subscribers via satellite. Until 2006 Dream offered a reasonable alternative to Sky cable.  But because of mismanagement Dream now offers a very limited, and continuously shrinking number of channels, at prices far higher than than top packages of the cable providers.  So it is now only a viable choice in areas too remote to have a cable provider. 

In spite of the advantages each competitor has over SkyCable, it has been seen that the latter is still the most preferred among them. This is mainly due to its vast variety of channels sourcing from [[STAR TV]],  [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|SPE Networks Asia]], [[Creative Programs, Inc.]], and [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]], which is testified by subscribers to be "worth the high cost."
