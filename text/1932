The '''[[National Tramway Museum]]''' in [[Crich]], [[Derbyshire]], has a very large and diverse fleet of heritage '''[[tramcar|tramcars]]''', and aims to illustrate the complete development of the traditional British Tramcar. Where it isn't possible to show this, tramcars from places as far away as [[Berlin]], [[Den Haag]], [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Hill of Howth Tramway|Howth]], [[Johannesburg]], [[New York]], [[Oporto]], [[Prague]] and [[Sydney]] have been acquired to show this. The majority of the trams at Crich are double-deck trams built between 1900 and 1930<ref name=BTO_fleetlist>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/crich.html|title=British Trams Online Fleetlist}}</ref>, and several have open tops. There are a few trams in the collection that were built after WWII, and these give an idea of how the British Tram Industry may have developed if services had not declined.

Unfortunately, only about fourteen<ref name=BTO_fleetlist>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/crich.html|title=British Trams Online Fleetlist}}</ref><!-- <----Please change this number relating to the number of red sections on the fleet list below! --> of these beautiful vehicles are currently in operational condition, and there are many more on display and being restored...

Every operating day, the museum selects between two and four trams and operates them over it's line to Glory Mine, via Wakebridge. In addition, there is a [[#Berlin 3006|1969 Berlin Tram]] that has been converted into an ''"Access Tram"'', which allows the less able to travel over the line.

[[#Southampton 45|Southampton 45]] was the very first tramcar to be preserved by the Tramway Museum Society, purchased for just <U+00A3>10 in 1949, after the closing ceremony of the Southampton Corporation.<ref name=Official_fleetlist>{{cite web|url=http://www.tramway.co.uk/smx/cms/tramfleet/|title=Official Fleetlist}}</ref><ref name=BTO_soton_45>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/45.html|title=Southampton 45 Profile}}</ref>

*The steam tram engine ''John Bull'' has an intriguing past - it is rumoured to have fallen into the sea on its way from New South Wales to Manchester; it disappeared in Sydney; and re-surfaced in 1980!<ref name=Guidebook-2003-2008>{{cite book|title=Crich Tramway Village Guidebook, 2003-2008 Edition|date=2003-2008|publisher=National Tramway Museum}}</ref>
*Sheffield Tram No. 510, entered service in 1950 and was withdrawn, still almost brand-new, when the city's tram system closed in 1960! Ironically, this tram has in fact now done more years at the museum than it did in Sheffield.<ref name=Guidebook-2003-2008>{{cite book|title=Crich Tramway Village Guidebook, 2003-2008 Edition|date=2003-2008|publisher=National Tramway Museum}}</ref>
*When made redundant, Blackpool Tram No. 166 was commandeered by the BBC, along with its sister No. 165, as an outside broadcast unit. Many seats were removed, and cameras and recording gear were mounted, to allow the illuminations to be filmed - the already congested promenade could not take any more traffic, ruling out conventional outside broadcast units.<ref name=Guidebook-2003-2008>{{cite book|title=Crich Tramway Village Guidebook, 2003-2008 Edition|date=2003-2008|publisher=National Tramway Museum}}</ref>
*Not many of the museum's trams can claim to have been on TV or have front page news, but one can! Prague No. 180 had more press coverage than the rest of the fleet put together.<ref name=Guidebook-2003-2008>{{cite book|title=Crich Tramway Village Guidebook, 2003-2008 Edition|date=2003-2008|publisher=National Tramway Museum}}</ref> This is because when it was transported to Crich, it was running just ahead of the "Iron curtain" of communist occupation. It became a symbol of the plight of the country. It was restored by its original manufacturers, Tatra, who later made 902.
*The 1904 Chesterfield tramcar No.7 has had many adventures, and some great escapes! First, it survived a depot fire which destroyed many other trams. Then, it was used as a house by Mr. Eric Cocking - who had actually travelled to school in it. Finally, the museum found the tram, and now, after restoration, it lives happily amongst the operating fleet.<ref name=Guidebook-2003-2008>{{cite book|title=Crich Tramway Village Guidebook, 2003-2008 Edition|date=2003-2008|publisher=National Tramway Museum}}</ref>
*Similarly, recently restored Leeds 345 is a very lucky tram. Withdrawn early due to rotten bodywork, it was used as a carpenters' tea shed at a Leeds depot. It was rescued by K. Terry, and for years sat at Crich. It was moved to an outside store, where later on a fire was started. When restored, parts of the lower deck ceiling were found to be singed.
*Sheffield 74 is in fact made of 3 trams. The top and bottom decks are from different Sheffield trams, and the truck from Leeds.
*London County Council 1622 was originally an open ended unrefurbished car, but was restored as an enclosed "rehab" car. Its bogies are ex Feltham.


==Southampton 45==
[[Image:Southampton 45.jpg|right|170px]]
'''Southampton 45''' was built 1903 by Hurst Nelson as an open-top double-deck tram with a 3 windowed lower saloon. At some stage it was rebuilt with canopies and 4 saloon windows by the [[Southampton Corporation Tramways]], however the exact date is unknown. <ref name=BTO_soton_45>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/45.html|title=Southampton 45 Profile}}</ref>

This tram was the one that started the whole preservation movement, being bought by enthusiasts for just <U+00A3>10 in 1949.<ref name=Official_fleetlist>{{cite web|url=http://www.tramway.co.uk/smx/cms/tramfleet/|title=Official Fleetlist}}</ref><ref name=BTO_soton_45>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/45.html|title=Southampton 45 Profile}}</ref> However, there was no National Tramway Museum in 1949, and so the tram travelled the country staying at many locations, including [[Blackpool tramway#Marton Depot|Marton Depot]] in [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]], and the [[National Motor Museum]] at Beaulieu in Hampshire. Whilst it was at Beaulieu, [[#Newcastle 102]] was also there, and together they formed an open air display, before heading to Crich in 1960.

People often comment that the tram looks out of proportion: this is due to tha fact that it had to pass under the Mediaeval [[Bargate Arch]] in Southampton, and a normal tram wouldn't have fit under it without colliding. It also has knifeboard seating on the top deck for this reason.<ref name=BTO_soton_45>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/45.html|title=Southampton 45 Profile}}</ref><ref name=Guidebook-2003-2008>{{cite book|title=Crich Tramway Village Guidebook, 2003-2008 Edition|date=2003-2008|publisher=National Tramway Museum}}</ref>

==London County Council Tramways 106==

<!-- ==Leeds 600==
One of 3 Leeds experimental single deck cars: 600 was converted from Sunderland 85, fitted with EP (electropneumatic) control and EMB bogies. Currently stored off site. 601 was an EP version of 602, and was externally very similar. This car was preserved, but was destroyed by arson shortly after. -->

==Leeds 602==
[[Image:Leeds 602.JPG|right|170px]]
'''Leeds 602''' is one of three experimental tramcars built for Leeds City Tramways, the others being [[#Leeds 600|Leeds 600]], and Leeds 601.  The tramcar is the only vehicle at Crich to use VAMBAC (Variable Automatic Multinotch Braking and Acceleration Control)<ref name=Official_fleetlist>{{cite web|url=http://www.tramway.co.uk/smx/cms/tramfleet2/|title=Official Fleetlist}}</ref>, and one of only 4 in the country (2 of which are at [[Blackpool tramway|Blackpool]], and the other being at the [[East Anglian Transport Museum]].

It entered service on the 1st June 1953<ref name=Official_fleetlist>{{cite web|url=http://www.tramway.co.uk/smx/cms/tramfleet2/|title=Official Fleetlist}}</ref>, and was built by Bus Manufacturer Charles H. Roe. Leeds 602 was withdrawn at the last ever ''"close of play"'' in 1957. The design of 602 owes a lot to the Glasgow [[#Glasgow 1282|Cunarders]] and [[#Glasgow 1297|Coronations]], due to the fact that the General Manager of Leeds at the time was A.B.Findlay, who did at one stage produce drawings of a single-decker Cunarder. Findlay used these ideas to build two identical prototypes (601 and 602), and Leeds 602 was fitted with VAMBAC equipment under the Bow Collector. In addition, all it's fittings are elctrical, making it a very complicated tram!<ref name=602_BTO>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/602.html|title=British Trams Online 602 Profile}}</ref><ref name=602_TSW>{{cite web|url=http://train.spottingworld.com/Leeds_City_Tramways_VAMBAC_No._602|title=TrainSpottingWorld 602 Profile}}</ref>

602's service life was spent working the Hunslet Route around leeds - the blind for which can be seen in the picture - and it was here until the end of it's working life, when it was acquired for preservation at the National Tramway Museum.<ref name=602_BTO>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/602.html|title=British Trams Online 602 Profile}}</ref><ref name=602_TSW>{{cite web|url=http://train.spottingworld.com/Leeds_City_Tramways_VAMBAC_No._602|title=TrainSpottingWorld 602 Profile}}</ref> Leeds 601 was also preserved, but was destroyed soon after in an arson attack.

Once at Crich it was used in service between 1967 and 1972, before it's first workshop attention in 1973. It saw further used in 1974-5, and returned to the workshop in 1977. It was back in the fleet for the 1979-80 seasons, before having a third bout of workshop attention in 1986. Following this it had a longer operational life in 1987-1995, but it was finally withdrawn due to the discovery of a leaking roof. It was resurrected on a limted-use basis for the Tramathon in 2003 <ref name=03_tramathon>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/tramathon03.html|title=Tramathon 2003}}</ref>, and then it was withdrawn to have attention to it's leaky roof.  <ref name=602_BTO>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtramsonline.co.uk/602.html|title=British Trams Online 602 Profile}}</ref> This was finally fixed, and a long-needed repaint was undertaken. <ref name=TMS_Crich_forum>{{cite web|url=http://tmscrich.iphpbb.com|title=TMS Forum}}</ref> It returned for the Tramathon and Enthusiast's Day in 2005, and was used for 6 days in 2006.<ref name=602_TSW>{{cite web|url=http://train.spottingworld.com/Leeds_City_Tramways_VAMBAC_No._602|title=TrainSpottingWorld 602 Profile}}</ref> One of which was the enthusiast's day, which allowed the oppurtunity to ride both a bus and tram built by Charles H.

<!-- ==Liverpool 869== 
[[Image:Green Goddess.jpg|right|170px]]
This tram is in a Green and white livery, and is affectionately known as the Green Goddess. One of Liverpool's fleet of Bogie streamliners (there were also 4 wheel versions), it was later sold on to Glasgow, from where it was bought. Fitted with EP control, is often used for UDEs (Ultimate driving experiences, i.e. one-day tram driving courses for members of the public, equivalent to the "footplate experience" of steam railways) -->
