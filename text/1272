Lawson has written six bestselling cookery books in total. She originally came up with the idea of writing a cookery book after attending a dinner party and observing her host in tears due to an unset [[cr<U+00E8>me caramel]], prompting Lawson to realise that cooking should not be a stressful time.<ref name="itgirl">Dolce, Joe.

Retrieved on [[2008-01-31]].</ref> She then wrote ''How to Eat'' which was published in 1998,<ref name="sweetandsour"/> and included culinary tips on preparation and saving time.<ref name="itgirl"/> She further commented "It<U+2019>s true that I wouldn<U+2019>t have written the first book had my sister and mother been alive. It was my way of continuing our conversation.

She soon had a second best-selling book in 2000, ''How to be a Domestic Goddess'', and a social affairs column in ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref name="sweetandsour"/> Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book,<ref>Vickers, Amy.

==Popular culture==
Her style of presentation is often gently mocked by comedians and commentators, particularly in a regularly-occurring impersonation of her in the [[BBC]] television comedy series ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', who perceive that she plays overtly upon her attractiveness and sexuality as a device to engage viewers of her cookery programmes, despite Lawson's repeated denials that she does so.<ref>BBC Press Release.

She has also been featured on [[BBC One]] TV impersonation-sketch show ''[[Big Impression]]'', where [[Ronni Ancona]] has done impressions of her, which mock and embellish the fact that she uses slightly exotic foods. For example, in one sketch, a recipe requires [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] eggs. In her act, Ancona also lampooned Lawson's tendency to present her recipes with over-description. Lawson's view on Ancona's impressions is "very odd but very flattering at the same time."<ref name="Metro,Lawson"/>
