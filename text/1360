'''J<U+00F8>rgen Iversen Dyppel''' (also called '''George Iversen''' or '''Ifversen'''<ref>Ryberg/Vicq, Names, 134</ref>, or sometimes '''Doppel''' in Knox) ([[February 25]] [[1638]] - [[1683]]) was the first [[governor]] of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[Danish West Indies]], from 1672 to 1680.

==Biography==

Dyppel was born in [[Helsing<U+00F8>r]], [[Denmark]] as the son of a baker from [[Holstein]] or [[S<U+00F8>nderjylland]]<ref name=Bricka332>Bricka, Biografisk, 332</ref> and Else Pedersdatter.<ref>Ehrencron-M<U+00FC>ller, Forfatterlexikon, 343</ref> After his education, he went to the West Indies to trade with [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] residents. However, he had losses due to British pirates, and returned to Denmark in 1665.

There, he married Birgitte Pedersdatter in 1670, and due to his experiences in the West Indies, he was named by the newly founded [[Danish West India Company]] as the first governor of St. Thomas in 1671, for a term of three years. Dyppel left Denmark on [[October 20]] [[1671]] on the Danish vessel ''The Pharaoh'' and arrived [[May 23]] the following year<ref name=Knox47>Knox, Account, 47</ref>. Sources disagree on the exact date of his officially taking the gubernatorial position, as Bricka has the date as [[May 26]] [[1672]]<ref name=Bricka332 />, where Westergaard has May 25<ref>Westergaard, Danish West Indies, 22</ref>.

At the time when Danish West India Company claimed St. Thomas, it had been abandoned by the previous English settlers<ref name=Knox47 />, although some Dutch were there upon Dyppel's arrival. The estates of the present settlers were confirmed in deeds issued by Dyppel in 1678. Such estates were taxed for a capon or a turkey, which were used for a banquet each year.<ref>Knox, Account, 52</ref> Future governors [[Nicolai Esmit|Nicolai]] and [[Adolph Esmit]] are named as land owners in the 1678 deeds.<ref>Knox, Account, 247</ref>

{{Rquote|right|I, J<U+00F8>rgen Iversen, His Majesty the King of Denmark and Norway, and the West India Company's Governor of the Island of St. Thomas, find it right and proper to proclaim this ordinance for the honor of God, and the good of the country.|J<U+00F8>rgen Iversen Dyppel|Orders of [[August 8]] [[1672]]}}

His first orders included mandatory church attendance for all settlers (and piousness for [[indentured servant|white servants]]), the stocking of arms (swords and guns), and a curfew for black [[slaves]]<ref>Knox, Account, 48</ref>. Additionally, a system of alarms were set up in the case of hostile ships. A settler who spotted a ship was to fire his gun and alert his neighbor, who would in turn alert the next. Any rule broken resulted in a fine of 10 to 1000 pounds of tobacco, depending on the offense.<ref>Knox, Account, 49</ref>

The system of alarms was, according to Knox, instated due to the ''"[[Spanish people|Spaniards]], at [[Puerto Rico|Porto Rico]], still jealous of other nations possessing islands in their vicinity, sought to annoy [St. Thomas] by every means in their power. They often descended by night upon the island, and stole negroes and cattle."''<ref>Knox, Account, 51</ref> Another concern was French and English [[buccaneer]]s at [[Tortuga]].

Among Dyppel's other initial tasks included organizing the clearing of forests, building roads and plantations.<ref name=Bricka332 /> Due to the other Danes not being used to the climate, as well as the [[Franco-Dutch War|Franco-Dutch]] and [[Third_Anglo-Dutch_War|Anglo-Dutch]] wars, this proved a complex undertaking, and his term was extended.<ref name=Bricka332 /> Dyppel obtained some help from the British settlers of [[Tortola]].<ref>Westergaard, Danish West Indies, 23</ref>

The war caused problems with the predominantly Dutch settlers, and on February 2, 1678, St. Thomas was attacked by the French, albeit they were repelled. Dyppel's first wife died in 1679.<ref name=Bricka332 />

The task of defending St. Thomas proved arduous, and Dyppel called upon the company to find a replacement. The company elected [[Nicolai Esmit]]<U+00A0>as successor on [[September 9]] [[1679]], and Dyppel officially resigned as governor on July 4, 1680.<ref>Westergaard, Danish West Indies, 25</ref> <ref>Knox, Account, 54</ref> After returning to Denmark, he quickly rose in power in Danish West India Company, and in 1682 it was decided that he would return to St. Thomas to reclaim the title as governor. <ref name=Bricka332 /> Dyppel married the niece of Copenhagen mayor [[Bartholom<U+00E6>us Jensen]], Margrethe Christensdatter.<ref name=Bricka333>Bricka, Biografisk, 333</ref>

However, it proved difficult to find people willing to accompany him as settlers in Denmark, and instead convicted prisoners were brought along with the promise of freedom. During the trip, these prisoners [[mutiny|mutinied]] around [[New Years Eve]], 1683, and Dyppel was thrown overboard with one of his children.<ref name=Bricka332 /> His wife survived the ordeal and married a plantation owner on St. Thomas.<ref name=Bricka333 /> Dyppel's first son, Iver J<U+00F8>rgensen Dyppel, married Anna van Ockeren, who upon becoming a widow married future Governor [[Claus Hansen]].

Dyppel's legacy according to Biografisk Lexikon is that of an honest man and a hard worker.
