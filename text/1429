'''Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola''' (December, [[1559]] - March, [[1613]]), [[Spain|Spanish]] [[dramatist]] and [[poet]], was baptized at [[Barbastro]] on [[December 14]], 1559.

He was educated at the universities of [[Huesca]] and [[Saragossa]], becoming secretary to the duke de Villahermosa in [[1585]]. He was appointed historiographer of [[Aragon]] in 1599, and in 1610 accompanied the count de Lemos to [[Naples]], where he died in March 1613.

His tragedies&mdash;''Fills'', ''Isabela'' and ''Alejandra''&mdash;are said by [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]] to have "filled all who heard them with admiration, delight and interest"; ''Filis'' is lost, and ''Isabela'' and ''Alejandra'', which were not printed till [[1772]], are imitations of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].

Argensola's poems were published with those of [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Leonardo de Argensola|his brother]] in [[1634]]; they consist of translations from the Latin poets, and of original [[satire]]s.
