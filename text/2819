==Overview==
[[File:Buenos Aires Puerto Madero Molinos 1999-05-01.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The former Molinos mill and silos in the [[Puerto Madero]] ward of Buenos Aires, converted into the upscale [[Faena Hotel+Universe]] in 2004]]
Molinos R<U+00ED>o de la Plata (Molinos) originated with the 1899 establishment of ''Centenera'', a food processing plant, by [[Bunge y Born]], then a prominent local [[wheat]] milling company established by [[Belgian people|Belgian]] immigrants in 1884. They had one of the largest wheat mills in the country built on a [[Puerto Madero]] lot in 1902, and with it, established ''Molinos R<U+00ED>o de la Plata'' (later a leader in the local retail foods market).<ref name=educ>[http://www.educ.ar/educar/site/educar/kbee:/educar/content/portal-content/taxonomia-recursos/recurso/ec264d95-fe4d-4ca0-91a9-56f79f08e909.recurso/943ae22b-4e52-49f0-97f3-b7ed2ddd0762/soc-poli-6.pdf educ.ar - Procesos econ<U+00F3>micos en la Argentina: el caso de Bunge y Born {{es icon}}]</ref>

Bunge & Born divested itself of almost all its retail foods interests in 1998, however, and was reorganized as [[Bunge Limited]], upon which a controlling stake in Molinos was sold to [[Gregorio P<U+00E9>rez Companc]].<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/economico/98-05-31/o-00401e.htm ''Clar<U+00ED>n'': La retirada final del grupo Bunge & Born {{es icon}}]</ref> 

On August 1, 2002, Molinos announced the partial repurchase of its [[USD]] $150 million senior [[trade finance|secured export note]]s (SENs), due 2006. Molinos repurchased USD $31.4 million face value of the notes at a 25% discount, using available cash balances. Following the repurchase, the amount outstanding on the SENs is USD $52.6 million.

The transaction has improved Molinos' financial profile by reducing the debt burden and lowering debt servicing costs. Molinos remains current on its scheduled debt payments. Notwithstanding, Molinos' credit risk remains high due to the negative financial ramifications of the peso's devaluation and the adverse economic environment in the country. On a ''[[pro forma]]'' basis at June 30, 2002, after accounting for the repurchase, Molinos' total consolidated financial debt reached Arg$718.8 million (approximately USD $188 million), composed mainly of a balance outstanding on its SENs of US$52.6 million and US$84 million in working [[Financial capital|capital]] finance, most of it dollar denominated.<ref>MOLINOS RIO: Fitch Ratings Comments On Repurchase of SENs</ref>

Molinos operates 20 manufacturing plants, 10 distribution centers, and 600 trucks, among other facilities. It owns 75,000 hectares (188,000 acres) of prime [[Pampas]] land for the production of [[wheat]].<ref name=numeros/>
