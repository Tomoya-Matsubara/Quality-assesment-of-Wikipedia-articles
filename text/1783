'''Jack the Ripper''' is a [[pseudonym]] given to an unidentified [[serial killer]] active in the largely impoverished districts in and around [[Whitechapel]], [[London]], in late 1888. The name originated in [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] by someone claiming to be the murderer that was disseminated in the media. The letter is widely considered to be a hoax, and may have been written by a journalist in a deliberate attempt to heighten interest in the story.

Attacks ascribed to the Ripper typically involve women [[prostitution|prostitutes]] whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer possessed anatomical or surgical knowledge. Rumours that the murders were connected intensified in September and October 1888, and media outlets and [[Scotland Yard]] received a series of extremely disturbing letters from a writer or writers purporting to be the murderer. [[From Hell letter|One letter]], received by [[George Lusk]], of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], included half of a preserved human kidney, supposedly from one of the victims. Mainly because of the extraordinarily brutal character of the murders, and because of media treatment of the events, the public came increasingly to believe in a single serial killer, Jack the Ripper. Extensive newspaper coverage bestowed widespread and enduring international notoriety on the Ripper. The murders most often attributed to the Ripper occurred in the latter half of 1888, although a longer series of brutal [[Whitechapel murders|killings in Whitechapel]] persisted at least until 1891. The investigation was unable to connect the later killings conclusively to the murders of 1888, but the legend of Jack the Ripper solidified.

The term "ripperology" was coined to describe the study and analysis of the Ripper cases. As the murders were never solved, the legends surrounding them became a combination of genuine historical research, [[folklore]], and [[pseudohistory]]. There are over one hundred [[Jack the Ripper suspects|theories about the Ripper's identity]], and the murders have inspired [[Jack the Ripper fiction|multiple works of fiction]].

==Background==
In the mid 19th century, England experienced an influx of [[Irish diaspora|Irish immigrants]], who swelled the populations of England's major cities, including the [[East End of London]]. From 1882, [[Jew]]ish refugees from eastern Europe and [[Tsarist Russia]] moved into the same area.<ref>Kershen, Anne J., "The Immigrant Community of Whitechapel at the Time of the Jack the Ripper Murders", in Werner, pp. 65<U+2013>97; Vaughan, Laura, "Mapping the East End Labyrinth", in Werner, p. 225</ref> London's East End, and the [[civil parish]] of [[Whitechapel]] became increasingly overcrowded, work and housing conditions worsened, and a massive economic underclass developed.<ref>[http://booth.lse.ac.uk/ ''Life and Labour of the People in London'' (London: Macmillan, 1902<U+2013>1903)] (The [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] on-line archive) retrieved 5 August 2008</ref> Robbery, violence and alcohol dependency were commonplace, and the endemic poverty drove many women to [[prostitution]]. In October 1888, the [[London Metropolitan Police]] estimated that there were 1200 prostitutes and about 62 brothels in Whitechapel.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 1; Police report dated 25 October 1888, MEPO 3/141 ff. 158<U+2013>163, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 283; Rumbelow, p. 12</ref> The economic problems were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions. Between 1886 and 1889, frequent demonstrations, [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|such as that of 13 November 1887]], led to police intervention and further public unrest.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 131<U+2013>149; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 38<U+2013>42; Rumbelow, pp. 21<U+2013>22</ref> Racism, crime, social disturbance, and real deprivation fed public perceptions that Whitechapel was a notorious den of immorality.<ref>Marriott, John, "The Imaginative Geography of the Whitechapel murders", in Werner, pp. 31<U+2013>63</ref> In 1888, such perceptions were strengthened when a series of vicious and grotesque murders attributed to "Jack the Ripper" received unprecedented coverage in the media.<ref>Haggard, Robert F. (1993), [http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH35/haggard1.html "Jack the Ripper As the Threat of Outcast London"], ''Essays in History'', vol. 35, Corcoran Department of History at the University of Virginia, retrieved 7 December 2009</ref>

{{Main|Whitechapel murders}}
The large number of horrific attacks against women in the East End during this era adds uncertainty to how many victims were killed by the same person.<ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 20</ref> Eleven separate murders, stretching from 3 April 1888 to 13 February 1891, were included in a London [[Metropolitan Police Service]] investigation, and were known collectively in the police docket as the "[[Whitechapel murders]]".<ref name=met>[http://www.met.police.uk/history/ripper.htm "The Enduring Mystery of Jack the Ripper"], Metropolitan Police, retrieved 1 May 2009</ref><ref>Cook, pp. 33<U+2013>34; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 3</ref> Opinions vary as to whether these murders should be linked to the same culprit or not, but five of the eleven Whitechapel murders, known as the "canonical five", are widely believed to be the work of the Ripper.<ref>Cook, p. 151</ref> Most experts point to deep throat slashes, abdominal and genital-area mutilation, removal of internal organs, and progressive facial mutilations as the distinctive features of Jack the Ripper's ''[[modus operandi]]''.<ref name=keppel/>

The first two cases in the Whitechapel murders file, those of [[Emma Elizabeth Smith]] and [[Martha Tabram]], are non-canonical. Smith was robbed and sexually assaulted on [[Osborn Street]], Whitechapel, on 3 April 1888. A blunt object was inserted into her [[vagina]], which ruptured her [[peritoneum]]. She developed [[peritonitis]], and died the following day at [[London Hospital]].<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 27<U+2013>28; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 47<U+2013>50; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 4<U+2013>7</ref> She said that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of whom was a teenager.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 28; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 4<U+2013>7</ref> Although this attack was linked to the later murders by the press,<ref>e.g. ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'', 8 September 1888, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 155<U+2013>156 and Cook, p. 62</ref> it was almost certainly gang violence unrelated to the Ripper.<ref name=met/><ref name=odnb/><ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 49</ref>

Tabram was killed on 7 August 1888; she had suffered 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and the closeness of the location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 51<U+2013>55</ref> However, the attack differs from the canonical ones in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen. Many experts today do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 51<U+2013>55; Marriott, p. 13</ref>

===Canonical five===
The canonical five Ripper victims are [[Mary Ann Nichols]], [[Annie Chapman]], [[Elizabeth Stride]], [[Catherine Eddowes]] and [[Mary Jane Kelly]]. Nichols' body was discovered at about 3:40 a.m. on Friday 31 August 1888 in [[Buck's Row]] (now [[Durward Street]]), Whitechapel. The throat was severed deeply by two cuts, and the lower part of the abdomen was partly ripped open by a deep, jagged wound. Several other incisions on the abdomen were caused by the same knife.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 60<U+2013>61; Rumbelow, pp. 24<U+2013>27</ref>

Chapman's body was discovered at about 6 a.m. on Saturday 8 September 1888 near a doorway in the back yard of 29 [[Hanbury Street]], [[Spitalfields]]. As in the case of Mary Ann Nichols, the throat was severed by two cuts.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> The abdomen was slashed entirely open, and it was later discovered that the [[uterus]] had been removed.<ref>Marriott, pp. 26<U+2013>29; Rumbelow, p. 42</ref> At the inquest, one witness described seeing Chapman with a dark-haired man of "shabby-genteel" appearance at about 5:30 a.m.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 153; Cook, p. 163; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 98; Marriott, pp. 59<U+2013>75</ref>

Stride and Eddowes were killed on Sunday 30 September 1888. Stride's body was discovered at about 1 a.m., in Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now [[Henriques Street]]) in Whitechapel. The cause of death was one clear-cut incision which severed the main artery on the left side of the neck. Uncertainty about whether Stride's murder should be attributed to the Ripper, or whether he was interrupted during the attack, stems from the absence of mutilations to the abdomen.<ref>Cook, p. 157; Marriott, pp. 81<U+2013>125</ref> Witnesses who thought they saw Stride with a man earlier that night gave differing descriptions: some said her companion was fair, others dark; some said he was shabbily-dressed, others well-dressed.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 176<U+2013>184</ref> Eddowes' body was found in [[Mitre Square]], in the [[City of London]], three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed, and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man, [[Joseph Lawende]], had passed through the square shortly before the murder with two friends, and he described seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes.<ref name=lawende/> His companions, however, were unable to confirm his description.<ref name=lawende>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 193<U+2013>194; Chief Inspector Swanson's report, 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, pp. 185<U+2013>188</ref> Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the "double event".<ref>e.g. Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 30; Rumbelow, p. 118</ref> Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing on the wall above the apron piece, which became known as the [[Goulston Street graffito]], seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or merely incidental.<ref>Cook, p. 143; Sugden, p. 254</ref> [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Police Commissioner]] [[Charles Warren]] feared the graffito might spark [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] riots, and ordered it washed away before dawn.<ref>Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], 6 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 183<U+2013>184</ref>
[[File:MaryJaneKelly Ripper 100.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black and white photograph of an eviscerated human body lying on a bed. The face is mutilated.|Official police photograph of Mary Kelly's murder scene in 13 Miller's Court.]]
Kelly's gruesomely mutilated body was discovered lying on the bed in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, off [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street, Spitalfields]], shortly after 10:45 a.m. on Friday 9 November 1888. The throat had been severed down to the spine, and the abdomen virtually emptied of its organs. The heart was missing.

The canonical five murders were perpetrated at night, on or close to a weekend, and either at the end of a month or a week or so after.<ref>e.g. ''Daily Telegraph'', 10 November 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 339<U+2013>340</ref> The mutilations became increasingly severe as the series of murders proceeded, except for that of Stride, whose attacker may have been interrupted.<ref>Macnaghten's notes quoted by Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 584<U+2013>587</ref> Nichols was not missing any organs; Chapman's uterus was taken; Eddowes had her uterus and a kidney removed and her face mutilated; Kelly's body was eviscerated and her face hacked away, though only her heart was missing from the crime scene.

Historically, the belief that these five crimes were committed by the same man derives from contemporary documents that link them together to the exclusion of others.<ref>Cook, p. 151; Woods and Baddeley, p. 85</ref> In 1894, Sir [[Melville Macnaghten]], Assistant [[Chief Constable]] of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] and Head of the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID), wrote a report that stated: "the Whitechapel murderer had 5 victims<U+2014>& 5 victims only".<ref>Macnaghten's notes quoted by Cook, p. 151; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 584<U+2013>587 and Rumbelow, p. 140</ref> Similarly, the canonical five victims were linked together in a letter written by the police surgeon [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]] to [[Robert Anderson (police official)|Robert Anderson]], head of the London CID, on 10 November 1888.<ref name=bond/> While the police evidently treated the five murders as a single case, authors Stewart P. Evans and [[Donald Rumbelow]] argue that the canonical five is a "Ripper myth" and that while three cases (Nichols, Chapman, and Eddowes) can be definitely linked, there is less certainty over Stride and Kelly, and less again over Tabram.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 260</ref> Dr Percy Clark, assistant to the examining pathologist [[George Bagster Phillips]], linked only three of the murders and thought the others were perpetrated by "weak-minded individual[s]&nbsp;... induced to emulate the crime".<ref>Interview in the ''East London Observer'', 14 May 1910, quoted in Cook, pp. 179<U+2013>180 and Evans and Rumbelow, p. 239</ref> Macnaghten did not join the police force until the year after the murders, and his memorandum contains serious factual errors about possible suspects.<ref>Marriott, pp. 231<U+2013>234; Rumbelow, p. 157</ref> Some researchers have posited that the series may not have been the work of a single murderer at all, but of an unknown larger number of killers acting independently.<ref>e.g. Cook, pp. 156<U+2013>159</ref> Conversely, others suppose that the six murders between Tabram and Kelly were the work of a single killer.<ref name=keppel/>

===Later Whitechapel murders===
Kelly is generally considered to be the Ripper's final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit's death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration.<ref name=odnb/> The Whitechapel murders file does, however, detail another four murders that happened after the canonical five, those of Rose Mylett, Alice McKenzie, The Pinchin Street torso, and Frances Coles.

Mylett was found strangled in Clarke's Yard, High Street, [[Poplar, London|Poplar]] on 20 December 1888. As there was no sign of a struggle, the police believed that she had accidentally choked herself while in a drunken stupor, or committed suicide.<ref name=mylett/> Nevertheless, the inquest jury returned a verdict of murder.<ref name=mylett>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 245<U+2013>246; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 422<U+2013>439</ref>

McKenzie was killed on 17 July 1889 by severance of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts were found on the body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]], believed this to be a Ripper murder, though another pathologist, [[George Bagster Phillips]], who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 208<U+2013>209; Rumbelow, p. 131</ref> Later writers are also divided between those who think that her murderer copied the Ripper's ''modus operandi'' to deflect suspicion from himself,<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 209</ref> and those that ascribe it to the Ripper.<ref>Marriott, p. 195</ref>

"The Pinchin Street torso" was a headless and legless torso of an unidentified woman found under a railway arch in Pinchin Street, Whitechapel, on 10 September 1889. It seems probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and that parts of the dismembered body were dumped at the crime scene.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 210; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 480<U+2013>515</ref>

Coles was killed on 13 February 1891 under a railway arch at Swallow Gardens, Whitechapel. Her throat was cut but the body was not mutilated. A man named [[Jack the Ripper suspects#James Thomas Sadler|James Thomas Sadler]], seen earlier with her, was arrested by the police, charged with her murder and was briefly thought to be the Ripper.<ref name=coles/> He was, however, later discharged from court due to lack of evidence on 3 March 1891.<ref name=coles>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 218<U+2013>222; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 551<U+2013>568</ref>

===Other alleged victims===<!--not all of the following cases were murders, so cannot say "other murders"-->
In addition to the eleven Whitechapel murders, other contemporary attacks have been connected to the Ripper by commentators. In some cases, it is unclear whether these stories were true or whether they were fabricated as a part of Ripper lore.<ref name="Hunted"/> "Fairy Fay" was a nickname for an unknown murder victim allegedly found on 26 December 1887 "after a stake had been thrust through her abdomen".<ref>[[Martin Fido|Fido, Martin]] (1993), ''The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper'', New York: Barnes and Noble, ISBN 9781566195379, p. 15</ref> It has been suggested that "Fairy Fay" was a creation of the press based upon confusion of the details of the murder of Emma Elizabeth Smith with a separate non-fatal attack the previous Christmas.<ref name="Hunted">Evans, Stewart P.; Connell, Nicholas (2000). ''The Man Who Hunted Jack the Ripper''. ISBN 1902791053</ref> The name of "Fairy Fay" was first used for this alleged victim in 1950.<ref>''[[Reynold's News]]'', 29 October 1950, in which Terrence Robinson dubs her Fairy Fay "for want of a better name"</ref> There were no recorded murders in Whitechapel at or around Christmas 1887.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 3</ref> Most authors agree that "Fairy Fay" never existed.<ref name="Hunted" /><ref name="TheFacts">Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Facts'', pp. 21<U+2013>25</ref>

Annie Millwood (born c. 1850) was reportedly admitted to hospital with "numerous stabs in the legs and lower part of the body"<ref>''The Eastern Post and City Chronicle'', 7 April 1888</ref> on 25 February 1888. She was discharged but died from apparently natural causes on 31 March 1888.<ref name="TheFacts" /> Ada Wilson reportedly survived being stabbed twice in the neck on 28 March 1888.<ref>e.g. ''East London Advertiser'', 31 March 1888</ref><ref>Scott, Christopher (2004).

She had a superficial cut on her throat, possibly self-inflicted. A Jewish cigar-maker, Joseph Isaacs, was arrested on suspicion of the attack and of being the Ripper, but was not connected to the crimes.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 202</ref>
[[File:Whitehall murder school illustration.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of three men discovering the torso of a woman|"[[The Whitehall Mystery]]" of October 1888]]
"[[The Whitehall Mystery]]" was a term coined for the discovery of a headless torso of a woman on 2 October 1888 in the basement of the new [[Norman Shaw Buildings|Metropolitan Police headquarters]] being built in [[Whitehall]]. An arm belonging to the body was previously discovered floating in the [[river Thames]] near [[Pimlico]], and one of the legs was subsequently discovered buried near where the torso was found.<ref name=e&r>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 142<U+2013>144</ref> The other limbs and head were never recovered and the body was never identified. The mutilations were similar to those in the Pinchin Street case, although in that case the hands were not severed. It has been suggested that The Whitehall Mystery and the Pinchin Street case may have been part of a series of murders, called the "Thames Mysteries" or "Embankment Murders", committed by a single serial killer, dubbed the "Torso killer".<ref name=scott>Scott, Christopher (2004).

Michael (2002), "The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London", Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland & Company, ISBN 9780786413485</ref> As the ''modus operandi'' of the torso killer differed from that of the Ripper, police at the time discounted any connection between the two.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 210<U+2013>213</ref> Elizabeth Jackson, a prostitute whose various body parts were collected from the [[river Thames]] between 31 May and 25 June 1889, may have been another victim of the "Torso killer".<ref name=scott/>

John Gill, a seven-year-old boy was found murdered in [[Manningham, Bradford]], on 29 December 1888. His legs had been severed, his abdomen opened, his intestines drawn out, and his heart and one ear removed. The similarities with the murder of Mary Kelly led to press speculation that the Ripper had killed the boy.<ref name=gill/> The boy's employer, milkman William Barrett, was twice arrested for the murder on circumstantial evidence but was released.<ref name=gill/> No-one else was ever prosecuted.<ref name=gill>Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 136</ref>

[[Carrie Brown (murder victim)|Carrie Brown]] (nicknamed "Shakespeare", reportedly for quoting [[Shakespeare's sonnets]]) was strangled with clothing and then mutilated with a knife on 24 April 1891 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=brown/> Her body was found with a large tear through her groin area and superficial cuts on her legs and back. No organs were removed from the scene, though an ovary, either purposely removed or unintentionally dislodged, was found upon the bed.<ref name=brown/> At the time, the murder was compared to those in Whitechapel though the Metropolitan Police eventually ruled out any connection.<ref name=brown>Vanderlinden, Wolf (2003<U+2013>04).

==Investigation==
[[File:F.G.Abberline.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Sketch of a whiskered man in profile|Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], 1888]]
The surviving police files on the Whitechapel murders allow a detailed view of investigative procedure in the [[Victorian era]].<ref name=canter12/> A large team of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel, forensic material was collected and examined and suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Over 2000 people were interviewed, "upwards of 300" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.<ref>Inspector [[Donald Swanson]]'s report to the Home Office, 19 October 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 113; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125</ref> Police work follows the same pattern today.<ref name=canter12>[[David Canter|Canter, David]] (1994), ''Criminal Shadows: Inside the Mind of the Serial Killer'', London: HarperCollins, pp.12<U+2013>13, ISBN 0 00 255215 9</ref> 

The investigation was initially conducted by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] Whitechapel (H) Division [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) headed by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid. After the Nichols murder, Detective Inspectors [[Frederick Abberline]], Henry Moore, and Walter Andrews were sent from Central Office at [[Scotland Yard]] to assist. After the Eddowes murder, which occurred within the [[City of London]], the [[City of London Police|City Police]] under Detective Inspector James McWilliam were involved.<ref name=met/> However, overall direction of the murder enquiries was hampered by the fact that the newly appointed head of the CID, [[Robert Anderson (police official)|Robert Anderson]], was on leave in [[Switzerland]] between 7 September and 6 October, during the time Chapman, Stride and Eddowes were killed.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 675</ref> This prompted the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Charles Warren]], to appoint Chief Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] to coordinate the enquiry from Scotland Yard.<ref>Begg, p. 205; Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref>

[[File:Ripper cartoon punch.png|thumb|right|alt=Drawing of a blind-folded policeman with arms outstretched in the midst of a bunch of ragamuffin ruffians|"Blind-man's Buff": ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[John Tenniel]] (22 September 1888) criticising the police's alleged incompetence. The failure of the police to capture the killer reinforced the attitude held by radicals that the police were inept and mismanaged.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 57</ref>]]
Due in part to dissatisfaction with the police effort, a group of volunteer citizens in [[East End of London|London's East End]] called the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, petitioned the government to raise a reward for information about the killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.<ref name=committee/> The committee was led by [[George Lusk]] in 1888.<ref name=committee>e.g. Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 245<U+2013>252</ref>

Butchers, slaughterers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. A surviving note from Major Henry Smith, Acting Commissioner of the [[City of London Police|City Police]], indicates that the alibis of many local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were all eliminated from the inquiry.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 274</ref> A report from Inspector [[Donald Swanson]] to the Home Office confirms that 76 butchers and slaughterers were visited, and that the inquiry encompassed all their employees for the previous six months.<ref>Inspector Donald Swanson's report to the [[Home Office]], 19 October 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 206 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 125</ref> Some commentators at the time, including [[Queen Victoria]], thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the [[London Docks]],<ref>Marriott, John, "The Imaginative Geography of the Whitechapel murders", in Werner, p. 48</ref> and such boats usually docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday.<ref>Rumbelow, p. 93; ''Daily Telegraph'', 10 November 1888, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 341</ref> The cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.<ref>Robert Anderson to Home Office, 10 January 1889, 144/221/A49301C ff. 235<U+2013>6, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 399</ref>

At the end of October, [[Robert Anderson (police official)|Robert Anderson]], head of the London CID, asked police surgeon [[Thomas Bond (British physician)|Thomas Bond]] to give his opinion as to the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge.<ref>Evans and Rumbelow, pp. 186<U+2013>187; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 359<U+2013>360</ref> The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the "Whitechapel murderer" is the earliest surviving [[Offender profiling|offender profile]].<ref name=canter5>Canter, pp. 5<U+2013>6</ref> Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the [[post mortem]] notes from the four previous canonical murders.<ref name=bond>Letter from Thomas Bond to Robert Anderson, 10 November 1888, HO 144/221/A49301C, quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 360<U+2013>362 and Rumbelow, pp. 145<U+2013>147</ref> He wrote:

{{quote|All five murders no doubt were committed by the same hand. In the first four the throats appear to have been cut from left to right, in the last case owing to the extensive mutilation it is impossible to say in what direction the fatal cut was made, but arterial blood was found on the wall in splashes close to where the woman's head must have been lying.<br />All the circumstances surrounding the murders lead me to form the opinion that the women must have been lying down when murdered and in every case the throat was first cut.<ref name=bond/>}}

Bond was strongly opposed to the idea that the murderer possessed any kind of scientific or anatomical knowledge, or even "the technical knowledge of a butcher or horse slaughterer".<ref name=bond/> In his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to "periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic [[mania]]", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating "[[satyriasis]]".<ref name=bond/> Bond also stated that "the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely".<ref name=bond/> While there is no evidence of any sexual activity with any the victims,<ref name=keppel/><ref>Woods and Baddeley, p. 38</ref> psychologists suppose that the penetration of the victims with a knife and "leaving them on display in sexually degrading positions with the wounds exposed" indicates that the perpetrator derived sexual pleasure from the attacks.<ref name=keppel>[[Robert D.

==Suspects==
{{Main|Jack the Ripper suspects}}
[[File:JacktheRipperPuck.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Cartoon of a man holding a bloody knife looking contemptuously at a display of half-a-dozen supposed and dissimilar likenesses|Speculation as to the identity of Jack the Ripper: cover of the 21 September 1889, issue of ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, by cartoonist [[William Mecham|Tom Merry]].]]
The concentration of the killings at the weekend, and within a few streets of each other, has indicated to many that the Ripper was employed during the week and lived locally.<ref>Marriott, p. 205; Rumbelow, p. 263</ref> Others have thought the killer was an educated upper-class man, possibly a doctor, who ventured into Whitechapel from a more well-to-do area;<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 43</ref> such notions draw on cultural perceptions such as fear of the medical profession, distrust of modern science or the exploitation of the poor by the rich.<ref>Meikle; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 111<U+2013>114</ref> Author [[Stephen Knight]] promoted an elaborate [[Masonic conspiracy theory]] involving the upper-class and a doctor in his 1976 book ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'', but many authors dismiss the theory as a fantasy.<ref>Begg, pp. x<U+2013>xi; Marriott, pp. 205, 267<U+2013>268; Rumbelow, pp. 209<U+2013>244; Woods and Baddeley, p. 70</ref> Suspects proposed years after the murders include virtually anyone remotely connected to the case by contemporary documents, as well as many famous names, who were never considered in the police investigation. As everyone alive at the time is now dead, modern authors are free to accuse anyone they can, "without any need for any supporting historical evidence".<ref name=e&r>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 261</ref> Suspects named in contemporary police documents include three in Sir [[Melville Macnaghten]]'s 1894 memorandum, but the evidence against them is circumstantial at best.<ref>e.g [[Frederick Abberline]] in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 31 March 1903, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 264</ref>

Despite the many and varied theories about the identity and profession of Jack the Ripper, authorities are not agreed on a single solution and the number of named suspects reaches over one hundred.<ref name=whiteway>Whiteway, Ken (2004). "A Guide to the Literature of Jack the Ripper", ''Canadian Law Library Review'', vol. 29 pp. 219<U+2013>229</ref><ref>Eddleston, pp. 195<U+2013>244</ref>

==Letters==
{{Ripper letters}}
Over the course of the Ripper murders, the police, newspapers and others received many hundreds of letters regarding the case.<ref>[[Donald McCormick]] estimated "probably at least 2000" (quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 180). The ''Illustrated Police News'' of 20 October 1888 said that around 700 letters had been investigated by police (quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 199). Over 300 are preserved at the Corporation of London Records Office (Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 149).</ref> Some were well-intentioned offers of advice for catching the killer but the vast majority were deemed useless and subsequently ignored.<ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 165; Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 105; Rumbelow, pp. 105<U+2013>116</ref>

Hundreds of letters claimed to have been written by the killer himself,<ref>Over 200 are preserved at the Public Record Office (Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', pp. 8, 180).</ref> and three of these in particular are prominent: the [[Dear Boss letter|"Dear Boss" letter]], the [[Saucy Jacky postcard|"Saucy Jacky" postcard]] and the [[From Hell letter|"From Hell" letter]].<ref>Marriott, pp. 219 ff.</ref>

The "Dear Boss" letter, dated 25 September, was [[postmark]]ed 27 September 1888. It was received that day by the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central News Agency]], and was forwarded to [[Scotland Yard]] on 29 September.<ref>Cook, pp. 76<U+2013>77; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 137; Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', pp. 16<U+2013>18; Woods and Baddeley, pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> Initially it was considered a hoax, but when Eddowes was found three days after the letter's postmark with one ear partially cut off, the letter's promise to "clip the ladys ([[sic]]) ears off" gained attention.<ref>Cook, pp. 78<U+2013>79; Marriott, p. 221</ref> However, Eddowes' ear appears to have been nicked by the killer incidentally during his attack, and the letter writer's threat to send the ears to the police was never carried out.<ref>Cook, p. 79; Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 179; Marriott, p. 221</ref> The name "Jack the Ripper" was first used in this letter by the signatory and gained worldwide notoriety after its publication.<ref>Cook, pp. 77<U+2013>78; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 140; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 193</ref> Most of the letters that followed copied this letter's tone.<ref>Cook, p. 87; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 652</ref> Some sources list another letter, dated 17 September 1888, as the first to use the name of Jack the Ripper, but most experts believe this was a modern fake inserted into police records in the 20th century, long after the killings took place.<ref>Marriott, p. 223</ref>

The "Saucy Jacky" postcard was postmarked 1 October 1888 and received the same day by the Central News Agency. The handwriting was similar to the "Dear Boss" letter.<ref>Marriott, pp. 219<U+2013>222</ref> It mentions that two victims were killed very close to one another: "double event this time", which was thought to refer to the murders of Stride and Eddowes.<ref name=saucy/> It has been argued that the letter was mailed before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that a crank would have such knowledge of the crime, but it was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings took place, long after details were known by journalists and residents of the area.<ref name=saucy>Cook, pp. 79<U+2013>80; Marriott, pp. 219<U+2013>222; Rumbelow, p. 123</ref>

The "From Hell" letter was received by [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] on 16 October 1888. The handwriting and style is unlike that of the "Dear Boss" letter and postcard.<ref name=hell/> The letter came with a small box in which Lusk discovered half of a human [[kidney]], preserved in "spirits of wine" ([[ethanol]]).<ref name=hell>Evans and Rumbelow, p. 170</ref> One of Eddowes' kidneys had been removed by the killer. The writer claimed that he "fried and ate" the missing kidney half.

Scotland Yard published facsimiles of the "Dear Boss" letter and the postcard on 3 October, in the ultimately vain hope that someone would recognise the handwriting.<ref>Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref> In a letter to Godfrey Lushington, Permanent [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], Charles Warren explained "I think the whole thing a hoax but of course we are bound to try & ascertain the writer in any case."<ref>Letter from Charles Warren to Godfrey Lushington, 10 October 1888, Metropolitan Police Archive MEPO 1/48, quoted in Cook, p. 78; Evans and Rumbelow, p. 140 and Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 43</ref> On 7 October 1888, [[George R. Sims]] in the Sunday newspaper ''[[Sunday Referee|Referee]]'' implied scathingly that the letter was written by a journalist "to hurl the circulation of a newspaper sky high".<ref>Quoted in Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', pp. 41, 52 and Woods and Baddeley, p. 54</ref> Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of both the "Dear Boss" letter and the postcard.<ref>Cook, pp. 94<U+2013>95; Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters From Hell'', pp. 45<U+2013>48; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', pp. 624<U+2013>633; Marriott, pp. 219<U+2013>222; Rumbelow, pp. 121<U+2013>122</ref> The journalist was identified as Tom Bullen in a letter from Chief Inspector [[John George Littlechild]] to George R. Sims dated 23 September 1913.<ref>Quoted in Cook, pp. 96<U+2013>97; Evans and Skinner, ''Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell'', p. 49; Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 193; and Marriott, p. 254</ref> A journalist called Fred Best reportedly confessed in 1931 that he'd written the letters to "keep the business alive".<ref>Professor Francis E.

Dr [[Thomas Horrocks Openshaw|Thomas Openshaw]] was frequently mentioned in press reports at the time in connection with the kidney and [[From Hell letter|"From Hell" letter]] sent to [[George Lusk]]. On 29 October 1888 he received a letter through the post addressed to 'Dr Openshaw, [[Pathology|Pathological]] curator, [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]], Whitechapel' and signed ''Jack the Ripper''.

After the murder of Nichols in early September, the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]'' reported that: "Whatever information may be in the possession of the police they deem it necessary to keep secret&nbsp;... It is believed their attention is particularly directed to... a notorious character known as 'Leather Apron'."<ref>''Manchester Guardian'', 6 September 1888, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 98</ref> Journalists were frustrated by the unwillingness of the CID to reveal details of their investigation to the public, and so resorted to writing reports of questionable veracity.<ref name=odnb/><ref>Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 214</ref> Imaginative descriptions of "Leather Apron" appeared in the press,<ref>e.g. ''Manchester Guardian'', 10 September 1888, and ''Austin Statesman'', 5 September 1888, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', pp. 98<U+2013>99; ''The Star'', 5 September 1888, quoted in Evans and Rumbelow, p. 80</ref> but rival journalists dismissed these as "a mythical outgrowth of the reporter's fancy".<ref>''Leytonstone Express and Independent'', 8 September 1888, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 99</ref> [[John Pizer]], a local Jew who made footwear from leather, was known by the name "Leather Apron"<ref name=pizer>e.g. Marriott, p. 251; Rumbelow, p. 49</ref> and was arrested, even though the investigating inspector reported that "at present there is no evidence whatsoever against him".<ref>Report by Inspector Joseph Helson, CID 'J' Division, in the Metropolitan Police archive, MEPO 3/140 ff. 235<U+2013>8, quoted in Begg, ''Jack the Ripper: The Definitive History'', p. 99 and Evans and Skinner, ''The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Sourcebook'', p. 24</ref> He was soon released after the confirmation of his alibis.<ref name=pizer/>
