'''Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill''', [[Order of the Garter|KG]], [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Order of the Companions of Honour|CH]], [[Territorial Decoration|TD]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|PC (Can)]] ([[30 November]] [[1874]]&ndash;[[24 January]] [[1965]]) was a [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British politician]] who served as Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. A noted [[statesman]], [[orator]] and [[strategist]], Churchill was also an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[British Army]]. A prolific [[author]], he won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1953 for his own historical writings.<ref>{{cite web |last= Siwertz| first=S|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1953/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1953 &ndash; Presentation Speech |accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref> 

During his army career Churchill saw combat with the [[Malakand Field Force]] on the [[Northwest Frontier]], at the [[Battle of Omdurman]] in the [[Sudan]] and during the [[Second Boer War]] in [[South Africa]]. During this period he also gained fame, and not a small amount of notoriety, as a correspondent. At the forefront of the political scene for almost sixty years, Churchill held numerous political and cabinet positions. Before the [[First World War]], he served as [[President of the Board of Trade]] and [[Home Secretary]] during the [[Liberal Government 1905-1915|Liberal governments]]. In the First World War Churchill served in numerous positions, as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Minister of Munitions]], [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air]]. He also served in the British Army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and commanded the 6th Battalion of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]]. During the [[Interwar period|interwar years]], he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. 

After the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Churchill was appointed [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]. Following the resignation of [[Neville Chamberlain]] in May 1940, he became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and led Britain to victory against the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. His speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]]. After losing [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|the 1945 election]], Churchill became the leader of the opposition. In 1951, Churchill again became Prime Minister before finally retiring in 1955. Upon his death, he was granted the honour of a [[state funeral]] which saw one of the largest assemblies of politicians in the world.

==Family and early life==
[[Image:Randolph Churchill.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill's father - [[Lord Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill]]]]

}}</ref> He, like his father and his immediate family, used the surname Churchill in public life.<ref>Jenkins, p. 1-20</ref> The Spencer family had adopted the Churchill surname in the [[18th century]] to highlight their descent from [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], who won the [[Battle of Blenheim]] and fought in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. John Churchill's mother was a first cousin several times removed of the explorer Sir [[Francis Drake]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 1-20</ref>

Winston's father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], the third son of the [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough|7th Duke of Marlborough]] was a politician. Winston's mother, [[Jennie Churchill|Lady Randolph Churchill]] (''[[n<U+00E9>e]]'' Jennie Jerome), the daughter of American millionaire [[Leonard Jerome]], was of mostly [[Colonial America]]n (ultimately [[English people|English]]) descent. Churchill was born two months premature in a bedroom in [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], [[Oxfordshire]] on [[30 November]] [[1874]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 5</ref> He arrived eight months after his parents' hasty marriage.<ref name="number-10">{{cite web | url = http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page1014.asp | title = PM record breakers | accessdate = 2007-02-26 | author =  | publisher = Number 10 Downing Street}}</ref> He had one brother, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill]].

Churchill had an independent and rebellious nature and generally did poorly in school, for which he was punished. He entered [[Harrow School]] on [[17 April]] [[1888]], where his military career began. Within weeks of his arrival, he had joined the [[Combined Cadet Force|Harrow Rifle Corps]].<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=638 Lt. Churchill: 4th Queen's Own Hussars], The Churchill Centre. Retrieved [[2007-12-02]]</ref> Churchill earned high marks in [[English studies|English]] and [[history]]; he was also the school's [[fencing (sport)|fencing]] champion. He was rarely visited by his mother (then known as Lady Randolph), but wrote letters begging her to either come to the school or to allow him to come home. Churchill also had a very distant relationship with his father and Churchill once remarked how they barely talked to each other.<ref>Jenkins, p. 10-11</ref> Due to his lack of parental contact Churchill became very close to his nanny, Elizabeth Anne Everest, whom he used to call "Woomany".<ref>{{cite web

===Speech impediment===
{{seealso|List of stutterers}}
Churchill described himself as having a "speech impediment", which he consistently worked to overcome. After many years, he finally stated, "My impediment is no hindrance." Although the Stuttering Foundation of America has claimed that Churchill [[stuttering|stammered]], the Churchill Centre has concluded that he [[lisp]]ed.<ref>{{cite web

Churchill's impediment may also have been [[cluttering]],<ref>[http://wvutoday.wvu.edu/news/page/5871/ Churchill and cluttering], WV university, accessed 2007-12-16</ref> which would fit more with his lack of attention to unimportant details and his very secure ego.

===Family life===
Churchill met his future wife, [[Clementine Churchill|Clementine Hozier]], in a ball at the Crewe House, home of the [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Earl of Crewe]] and his wife, [[Margaret Primrose]] (daughter of [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]]), in 1904.<ref>[[Mary Soames|Soames, Mary]]: ''Speaking for Themselves: The Personal Letters of Winston and Clementine Churchill''. p.1</ref> In 1908, Hozier and Churchill met again at a dinner party hosted by [[Francis Jeune, 1st Baron St Helier#Baroness St Helier|Lady St Helier]]. Churchill found himself seated alongside Hozier in the dinner party, and soon later, they began their lifelong courtship.<ref>Soames op cit. p.6</ref> On [[August 10]] [[1908]], Churchill proposed to Hozier in a house party in [[Blenheim Palace|Blenheim]], in a small [[Blenheim Palace#The Park and gardens|Temple of Diana]]. The engagement was announced publicly in [[August 15]], 5 days after the proposal.<ref>Soames op cit. pp.14-15</ref> On [[September 12]], [[1908]], Hozier and Churchill were married in [[Church of St. Margaret, Westminster]]. The church was packed; the [[Alfred George Edwards|Bishop of St Asaph]] conducted the service and [[James Edward Cowell Welldon|Bishop Welldon]], Churchill's headmaster at [[Harrow School|Harrow]], gave an address prior to the marriage.<ref>Soames op cit. p.17</ref>

In March 1909, the couple moved to a house in 33 Eccleston Square. By that time, Clementine was deep into pregnancy with their first child. On [[July 11]] [[1909]], in London, their first child was born, [[Diana Churchill]]. After the pregnancy, Clementine moved to Sussex to recover from her [[convalescence]] on Diana's birth, while Diana stayed in London with her nanny.<ref>Soames op cit. pp. 18, 22, 25.</ref>

==Service in the Army==
===Sandhurst===

After Churchill left Harrow in 1893, he applied to attend the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. However it took three attempts before Churchill passed the admittance exam.<ref>Jenkins, p. 20</ref> Once there, Churchill did well and he graduated eighth out of a class of 150 in December 1894.<ref>Jenkins, p. 20 - 21</ref> He was immediately commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[4th Queen's Own Hussars]] on [[20 February]] [[1895]].<ref name="centre-638"/> In 1941, he received the honour of Colonel of the [[Queen's Royal Hussars#Privileges & Traditions|Hussars]].

Churchill's official biographer Martin Gilbert noted in a 1991 interview about his book, ''Churchill: A Life'',<ref>{{cite journal | title=Churchill: A Life, by Martin Gilbert| url=http://www.booknotes.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1082 | author =Brian Lamb | journal=Booknotes /CSPAN December 22, 1991}}</ref> that Churchill was accused of [[Sodomy|buggering]] other students while at Sandhurst. In the book Gilbert states that Churchill immediately filed a libel case against his accuser, who was the father of a young officer snubbed by Churchill and his peers in the Hussars. According to Gilbert the father withdrew the charge and settled out of court with Churchill for a sum of <U+00A3>400.<ref>''Churchill: A Life'', New York, 1991, ISBN 0805023968</ref>

===War correspondent===
Churchill's pay as a [[second lieutenant]] in the 4th Hussars was <U+00A3>300. However Churchill believed that he needed at least <U+00A3>500 to support a style of life in keeping with other officers of the regiment. According to biographer Roy Jenkins, this is why Churchill took an interest in war correspondence.<ref>Jenkins, p. 21-45</ref> When Churchill finished training he asked to be posted to areas of action in which, against all etiquette, he earned additional income as a roving war correspondent for the London newspapers.<ref>{{cite journal | title=On the character and achievement of Sir Winston Churchill | author G. K. Lewis | journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science, Vol 23, No. 2 May, 1957 (May, 1957) | pages=pp 173-194}}</ref>

[[Bill Deedes|Lord Deedes]] explained to a gathering of the [[Royal Historical Society]] in 2001 why Churchill went to the front line. "He was with [[Grenadier Guards]], who were dry [without alcohol] at battalion headquarters. They very much liked tea and condensed milk, which had no great appeal to Winston, but alcohol was permitted in the front line, in the trenches. So he suggested to the colonel that he really ought to see more of the war and get into the front line. This was highly commended by the colonel, who thought it was a very good thing to do."<ref>{{cite journal | title=Churchill Remembered: Recollections by Tony Benn MP, Lord Carrington, Lord Deedes and Mary Soames | author T.

In 1895, Churchill travelled to [[Cuba]] to observe the Spanish fight the Cuban guerrillas; he had obtained a commission to write about the conflict from the ''Daily Graphic''.  To Churchill's delight, he came under fire for the first time on his twenty-first birthday.<ref name = "centre-638">{{cite web

About this time he read Winwood Reade's ''Martyrdom of Man'', a classic of Victorian [[atheism]], which completed his loss of faith in Christianity and left him with a sombre vision of a godless universe in which humanity was destined, nevertheless, to progress through the conflict between the more advanced and the more backward races. When he was posted to India and began to read avidly, to make up for lost time, Churchill was profoundly impressed by [[Darwinism]].<ref name = "centre-638">{{cite web

===Malakand===
[[Image:Wc0042-3b13159r.jpg|thumb|right|A young Winston Churchill on a lecture tour of the [[United States]] in 1900]]
In 1897, Churchill attempted to travel to both report and, if necessary, fight in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]], but this conflict effectively ended before he could arrive. Later, while preparing for a leave in [[England]], Churchill heard that three brigades of the [[British Army]] were going to [[Siege of Malakand|fight]] against a [[Pashtun]] tribe and he asked his superior officer if he could join the fight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arthursclassicnovels.com/arthurs/churchill/mkdff10.html | title=The Story Of The Malakand Field Force - An Episode of Frontier War | author=Sir Winston S. Churchill | work=arthursclassicnovels.com | accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> He fought under the command of General Jeffery, who was the commander of the second brigade operating in [[Malakand]], in what is now [[Pakistan]]. Jeffery sent fifteen scouts and Churchill to explore the [[Mamund]] Valley; while on reconnaissance, they encountered an enemy tribe, dismounted from their horses and opened fire. After an hour of shooting, their reinforcements, the 35th [[Sikhs]] arrived, and the fire gradually ceased and the brigade and the Sikhs marched on. Hundreds of tribesmen then ambushed them and opened fire forcing them to retreat. As they were retreating four men were carrying an injured officer but the fierceness of the fight forced them to leave him behind. The man who was left behind was slashed to death in front of Churchill<U+2019>s eyes; afterwards he wrote of his killer, ''"I forgot everything else at this moment except a desire to kill this man"''.<ref name="Mamund"/> However the Sikhs' numbers were being depleted so the next commanding officer told Churchill to get the rest of the men and boys to safety. 

Before he left he asked for a note so he would not be charged with desertion.<ref>{{cite book |last=Churchill |first=Winston |title=My Early Life |year=2002 |month=October |publisher=Eland Publishing Ltd |isbn=0907871623 |pages=p. 143}} </ref> He received the note, quickly signed, and headed up the hill and alerted the other brigade, whereupon they then engaged the army. The fighting in the region dragged on for another two weeks before the dead could be recovered. Churchill wrote in his journal: ''"Whether it was worth it I cannot tell."''<ref name="Mamund">{{cite news | title=Two opposition views of Afghanistan: British activist and Dutch MP want to know why their countries are participating in a dangerous adventure |publisher=Spectrazine | date=[[20 March]] [[2006]] | accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | date=[[11 December]] [[2004]] | title=Churchill On The Frontier - Mamund Valley III | publisher=UK Commentators | accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> An account of the [[Siege of Malakand]] was published in December 1900 as the ''[[The Story of the Malakand Field Force]]''.

===Sudan and Oldham===
[[Image:WinstonChurchillRiverWar.jpg|thumb|[[The River War]], one of Churchill's first books was published in 1899, a year after his first published work The [[Malakand Field Force]] in 1898]]
Churchill was transferred to [[Egypt]] in 1898 where he visited [[Luxor]] before joining an attachment of the [[21st Lancers]] serving in [[Sudan]] under the command of General [[Herbert Kitchener]]. During his time he encountered two future military officers of the [[First World War]]: [[Douglas Haig]], then a captain and [[Earl Jellicoe]], then a gunboat lieutenant.<ref>Jenkins, p.40</ref> While in the Sudan, Churchill participated in what has been described as the last meaningful British [[Charge (warfare)|cavalry charge]] at the [[Battle of Omdurman]] in September 1898. He also worked as a war correspondent for the ''[[Morning Post]]''. By October 1898, he had returned to Britain and begun his two-volume work;''[[The River War]]'', an account of the reconquest of the Sudan published the following year. Churchill stood for parliament in 1899 as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate in [[Oldham]] in a by-election, which he lost, coming third.<ref>Jenkins, p. 45-50</ref><ref name=gilbert>{{cite book | last =Gilbert | first =Martin | title =Churchill: A Study in Greatness (one volume edition) | publisher =Pimlico | date =2001 | location =London | id = 978-0712667258}}</ref>

===South Africa===
After Churchill's failure at the election in [[Oldham]], he went to [[South Africa]] in 1899 to report on the [[Second Boer War]] as a war correspondent. On [[12 October]] [[1899]], the war between Britain and the [[Boer Republics]] broke out in [[South Africa]]. Churchill was captured and held in a [[POW camp]] in [[Pretoria]].  <!-- His actions during the ambush led to speculation that he would be awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], Britain's highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy, but this did not occur.<ref name = "centre-638" />  Churchill later claimed that he had been captured by General [[Louis Botha]], subsequently prime minister of the then [[Union of South Africa]], but this claim has been challenged, notably by Churchill's grand-daughter Celia Sandys in her book ''Churchill Wanted Dead or Alive''. -->
Churchill escaped from the prison camp and travelled almost 300 miles (480 km) to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Maputo|Louren<U+00E7>o Marques]] in [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]], with the assistance of an English mine manager.<ref>Jenkins, p. 55-62</ref> His escape made him a minor [[Hero|national hero]] for a time in Britain, though instead of returning home, he rejoined General [[Redvers Henry Buller|Redvers Buller's]] army on its march to relieve the British at the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] and take Pretoria.<ref>Jenkins, p. 61-62</ref> This time, although continuing as a war correspondent, Churchill gained a commission in the South African [[Light Horse Regiment]]. He was one of the first British troops into [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] and Pretoria. In fact, he and [[Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough|the Duke of Marlborough]], his cousin, were able to get ahead of the rest of the troops in Pretoria, where they demanded and received the surrender of 52 Boer guards of the prison camp there.<ref>Jenkins, p. 62-64</ref>

In 1900, Churchill returned to England on the [[RMS Dunottar Castle|RMS ''Dunottar Castle'']], the same ship on which he set sail for South Africa eight months earlier,<ref name="finesthour127">{{cite web |url= http://www.winstonchurchill.org/files/public/FinestHour127.pdf |title=FinestHour |accessdate=2007-08-02 |format=pdf |work=Journal of the Churchill Center and Societies, Summer 2005}}</ref> and published books on the Boer war such as ''[[London to Ladysmith via Pretoria]]'' and ''[[Ian Hamilton's March]]'', which he then marked by a small tour of the [[United States]]<ref>Jenkins, p.69</ref>

==Early years in Parliament==
[[Image:Churchillelectionposteroldham.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill's election poster for the by-election in Oldham, his first election which he lost in 1899. A year later he was to win the seat following the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]]]]
After his failure to be elected in Oldham in 1899, he returned again to stand in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900|1900 general election]] (also known as "[[Khaki election#Khaki election, 1900|the Khaki election]]") for the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. He won and on February 1901 took his seat in the [[Houses of Parliament]].<ref name=gilbert />

In December 1900, a dinner was given at the Waldorf-Astoria in honor of the young journalist, recently returned from his well-publicized adventures in South Africa. [[Mark Twain]], who introduced him, had already, it seems, caught on to Churchill. In a brief satirical speech, Twain slyly suggested that, with his English father and American mother, Churchill was the perfect representative of Anglo-American cant. This time however he was elected, but rather than attending the opening of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], he embarked on a speaking tour throughout Britain and the United States, in the process raising <U+00A3>10,000 for himself. ([[Members of Parliament]] were unpaid in those days and Churchill was not rich by the standards of other MPs at that time.) In both of these elections, his campaign expenses were paid for by his cousin the 9th Duke of Marlborough.<ref>(p37 "The Aristocratic Adventurer by [[David Cannadine]] originally an essay entitled Churchill: The Aristocratic Adventurer"  in "Aspects of Aristocracy" )</ref>

In Parliament, Churchill became associated with a group of Tory dissidents led by [[Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood|Lord Hugh Cecil]] called the [[Hughligans]], a play on words with "[[hooligan]]s". During his first [[parliamentary session]], Churchill provoked controversy by opposing what he viewed as the government's extravagant [[Military budget|military expenditure]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 74-76</ref> By 1903, he was drawing away from Lord Hugh's views. He also opposed the [[Liberal Unionist]] leader [[Joseph Chamberlain]], whose party was in coalition with the Conservatives. Chamberlain proposed extensive tariffs intended to protect Britain's economic dominance. This earned Churchill the detestation of his own supporters<U+2014>indeed, Conservative backbenchers even staged a walkout once while he was speaking.<ref>Jenkins, p. 86</ref> His own constituency effectively deselected him, although he continued to sit for Oldham until the next general election.

In 1904, Churchill's dissatisfaction with the Conservatives had grown so strong that, on returning from the [[Whitsun]] recess, he [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to sit as a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. It was rumoured at the time that his real reason in doing so was that he would receive an official salary.<ref>(Cannadine [[op cit]] p. 27.)</ref> As a Liberal, he continued to campaign for [[free trade]]. He won the seat of [[Manchester North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester North West]] (carefully selected for him by the party - his electoral expenses were paid for by his uncle [[Edward Marjoribanks, 2nd Baron Tweedmouth|Lord Tweedmouth]], a senior Liberal<ref>See Cannadine op cit p. 3.</ref>) in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]]. As a Liberal, Churchill voted for a law that established labour rights in Britain; the 1906 [[Trade Disputes Act 1906|Trade Disputes Act]] ruled that unions were not liable for damages because of strikes.<ref>Jenkins, p. 147</ref> As President of the Board of Trade, he introduced a bill in 1908 setting up the first minimum wages in Britain -- Australia had created such a program in the 1890s -- mandating rates for both time- and piece-work for 200,000 workers in several industries. This "Trade Boards Bill," Churchill told his wife on April 28, 1909 "passed without a division."<ref>Churchill, Randolph. ''Winston S. Churchill: Young Statesman''. (c) 1967 C & T Publications: pp. 287-9</ref>

From 1903 until 1905, Churchill was also engaged in writing ''[[Lord Randolph Churchill (book)|Lord Randolph Churchill]]'', a two-volume biography of his father which was published in 1906 and received much critical acclaim.<ref>Jenkins, p. 102-103</ref> However, filial devotion caused him to soften some of his father's less attractive aspects.<ref>Jenkins, p. 101</ref> [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had known Lord Randolph, reviewed the book as "a clever tactful and rather cheap and vulgar life of that clever tactful and rather cheap and vulgar egotist".<ref>Cannadine op cit p. 47.</ref> Some historians suggest Churchill used the book in part to vindicate his own career and in particular to justify crossing the floor.<ref>e.g. Cannadine op cit p .41, [[Robert Rhodes James]] - ''Churchill: A Study in Failure''  p34-35</ref>

==Ministerial office==
===Growing prominence===
When the Liberals took office, with [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] as Prime Minister, in December 1905, Churchill became [[Under-Secretary of State]] for the Colonies. Serving under the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin]], Churchill dealt with the adoption of constitutions for the defeated [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] of the [[Transvaal]] and [[Orange River Colony]] and with the issue of 'Chinese slavery' in [[South Africa]]n mines.<ref name=gilbert /> He also became a prominent spokesman on free trade, declaring 
<blockquote>
<p>Why should we deny ourselves the good and varied merchandise which the traffic of the world offers, more especially since the more we trade with others, the more they must trade with us; for it is quite clear that we give them something else back for everything they give to us.<ref name=gilbert />
</p></blockquote>
Churchill had become one of the most prominent members of the Government outside the Cabinet, and when Campbell-Bannerman was succeeded by [[Herbert Henry Asquith]] in 1908, it came as little surprise that Churchill was promoted to the Cabinet as [[President of the Board of Trade]].<ref name=gilbert /> Under the law at the time, a newly appointed Cabinet Minister was obliged to seek re-election at a [[by-election]]. Churchill lost his Manchester seat to the Conservative [[William Joynson-Hicks, 1st Viscount Brentford|William Joynson-Hicks]] but was soon elected in another by-election at [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee constituency]].<ref name=gilbert /> 

As President of the Board of Trade he supported [[David Lloyd George]], the newly appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], in opposition to the huge expenditure for the construction of Navy [[dreadnought]] warships proposed by then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Reginald McKenna]]. This campaign was ineffective. They were only able to reduce the numbers of new construction to four ships from the six originally proposed.<ref name=toye /> 

Of more significance was his pursuit of radical social reforms known as the [[Liberal reforms]]. <ref name=toye>{{cite book | last =Toye | first =Richard| title =Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness | publisher =Macmillan | date =2007 | location =London | id = 978-1405048965}}</ref> Most notable amongst these was the [[People's Budget]]. The [[House of Lords]] vetoed the act. The Commons countered by threatening to reduce the power of the Lords and made this the main issue of two general elections in January and December of 1910. When the Liberal government won both elections they passed the [[Parliament Act 1911]] which curtailed the powers of the House of Lords. 

[[Image:Sidney street churchill.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Winston Churchill (highlighted) at Sidney Street, [[3 January]] [[1911]]]]
In 1910, Churchill was promoted to [[Home Secretary]]. His term as Home Secretary was to prove controversial for public opinion, after his responses to the [[Siege of Sidney Street]] and the [[Tonypandy Riot|dispute at the Cambrian Colliery]] caused a degree of tension.<ref name=gilbert /><ref name=toye /> On society, in 1910, he commented to [[Henry Asquith]] that "The unnatural and increasingly rapid growth of the feeble minded and insane classes, coupled as it is with a steady restriction among all the thrifty, energetic and superior stocks, constitutes a national and race danger which it is impossible to exaggerate...I feel that the source from which the stream of madness is fed should be cut off and sealed up before another year has passed".<ref name=Jones>{{cite book | last =Jones | first =Steven| title =The Language of Genes | publisher =Harper Collins | date =1991 | location =London | id = 978-1405048965}}</ref> A famous photograph from the time shows the impetuous Churchill at the scene of the January 1911 [[Siege of Sidney Street]], peering around a corner to view a gun battle between cornered anarchists and [[Scots Guards]]. His role attracted much criticism.<ref name=gilbert /><ref name=toye /> The building under siege caught fire and Churchill supported the decision to deny the [[Firefighter|fire brigade]] access, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death. [[Arthur Balfour]] asked, "He [Churchill] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing but what was [[the Right Honourable]] gentleman doing?"

In 1910, a number of coal miners in the Rhondda Valley began what has come to be known as the [[Tonypandy Riot]].<ref name=toye /> Initially, the Chief Constable of Glamorgan requested that troops be sent in to help police quell the rioting, and Churchill, when he learned that they had been started, allowed them to go as far as [[Swindon]] and [[Cardiff]] and authorized the commanding General to advance further if he should judge it necessary. Churchill, however, blocked the use of troops fearing a repeat of the [[Bloody Sunday 1887|1887 Bloody Sunday]] in [[Trafalgar Square]]. On 9 November, the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' leader criticized this decision, saying that responsibility for the "renewed rioting late last night...will lie with the Home Secretary [Churchill]" for countermanding the Chief Constable's request for troops. In spite of this, the rumour persists that Churchill had ordered troops to attack, and Churchill's reputation in Wales and in Labour circles never recovered.<ref>Churchill, Randolph. Winston S. Churchill: Young Statesman. (c) 1967 C & T Publications: 359-65</ref>

===First Lord of the Admiralty===
[[Image:Winston Churchill verl sst das Geb ude der Admiralt t (1912).jpg|thumb|right|Churchill in 1912 as [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]]]
In 1911, Churchill became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], a post he held into [[World War I]]. He gave impetus to reform efforts, including development of [[naval aviation]] (he undertook flying lessons himself)<ref>[http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/newreply.php?do=newreply&noquote=1&p=347553 Churchill took flying lessons, 1911], The Aerodrome.com</ref>, the development of tanks, and the switch in fuel for the [[Royal Navy]] from [[coal]] to [[oil]], a massive engineering task, also depending on securing [[Mesopotamia]]'s [[Mineral rights|oil rights]], bought in 1907 through  the [[Burmah Oil Company|Royal Burmah Oil Company]].<ref>''Naval innovation: from coal to oil'', Erik J. Dahl, [[Joint Force Quarterly]], 2000 </ref>

[[Image:0242.jpg|thumb|left|Winston Churchill, as the British Colonial Secretary, in Ottoman [[Damascus]], 1912.]]
Churchill was involved with the development of the [[tank]], which was financed from naval research funds. After witnessing a demonstration in which an armoured tractor successfully demonstrated its ability to cut through a barbed wire entanglement, Churchill and [[Lloyd George]] decided that tanks could prove useful.<ref name=WW1Tank>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/tanks.htm |title=The First World War, The development of the Tank, sponsored by Winston Churchill |accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref> Churchill then headed the [[Landships Committee]] which was responsible for creating the first tank corps and, although a decade later development of the battle tank would be seen as a tactical victory, at the time it was seen as misappropriation of funds.<ref name=WW1Tank>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/tanks.htm |title=The First World War, The development of the Tank, sponsored by Winston Churchill |accessdate=2007-12-16}}</ref>  The tank was deployed too early and in too small numbers, much to Churchill's annoyance. He wanted a fleet of tanks used to surprise the Germans under cover of smoke, and to open a large section of the trenches by crushing [[barbed wire]] and creating a breakthrough sector.<ref>Jenkins, p. 243 - 253</ref> 

In 1915, Churchill was one of the political and military engineers of the disastrous [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] landings on the [[Dardanelles]] during World War I.<ref name=Dardanelles>{{cite book | last =Callwell| first =C.E.| title =''Dardanelles'', a study of the strategical and certain tactical aspects of the Dardanelles campaign, | publisher =Naval & Military Press Ltd  | date =2005 | location =London | id = 978-1845742737}}</ref> Churchill took much of the blame for the fiasco, and when Prime Minister Asquith formed an all-party [[Coalition Government 1915-1916|coalition government]], the Conservatives demanded Churchill's demotion as the price for entry.<ref>Jenkins, p.282-88</ref> For several months Churchill served in the [[sinecure]] of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. However on 15 November 1915 he resigned from the government, feeling his energies were not being used.<ref>Jenkins, p. 287</ref> 

He then rejoined the army, though remaining an MP, and served for several months on the [[Western Front]] commanding the 6th Battalion of the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]], under the rank of [[Colonel]]. During this period, his [[second-in-command]] was a young [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]] who later led the Liberal Party. Although Churchill did spent some time behind the front, visiting leaders such as Field Marshal Sir [[John French]], Churchill did lead his battalion into the trenches on the 27 January 1916.<ref>Jenkins, p. 301</ref> In March, Churchill returned to [[England]] after he had become restless in France and wished to speak again in the House of Commons.<ref>Jenkins, p. 309</ref>

===Return to power===
In December 1916, Asquith resigned as Prime Minister and was replaced by [[David Lloyd George]]. The time was thought not yet right to risk the Conservatives' wrath by bringing Churchill back into government. However, in July 1917, Churchill was appointed [[Minister of Munitions]], and in January 1919, [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air]]. He was the main architect of the [[Ten Year Rule]], but the major preoccupation of his tenure in the [[War Office]] was the Allied intervention in the [[Russian Civil War]]. Churchill was a staunch advocate of foreign intervention, declaring that [[Bolshevism]] must be "strangled in its cradle".<ref name="centre-282">{{cite web

In 1920, after the last [[British Armed Forces|British forces]] had been withdrawn, Churchill was instrumental in having arms sent to the Poles when they invaded [[Ukraine]]. 

He became [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] in 1921 and was a signatory of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921, which established the [[Irish Free State]]. Churchill always disliked [[<U+00C9>amon de Valera]], the [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] leader. Churchill was involved in the length negotiations of the treaty and to protect British maritime interests, he engineered part of the [[Irish Free State]] agreement to include three [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]&mdash;Queenstown ([[Cobh]]), [[Berehaven]] and [[Lough Swilly]]&mdash;which could be used as Atlantic bases by [[Royal Navy|the Royal Navy]].<ref>Jenkins, p. 361-65</ref> Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement]] the bases were returned to the newly constituted [[<U+00C9>ire]] in 1938.

==Career between the wars==
===Second crossing of the floor===
In 1920, as Secretaries of State for War and Air, Churchill had responsibility for quelling the rebellion of [[Kurds]] and [[Arabs]] in British-occupied [[Iraq]]. In October 1922, Churchill underwent an operation to remove his [[appendix]]. Upon his return, he learned the government had fallen and a [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|General Election]] was looming. The Liberal Party was now beset by internal division and Churchill's campaign was weak. Even the [[D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd]], a [[Newspaper|local newspaper]] publisher, published vitriolic rhetoric about his political status in the city, particularly from [[David Coupar Thomson]]. At one meeting, he was only able to speak for 40 minutes when he was barracked by a section of the audience.<ref>{{cite web

Churchill stood for the Liberals again in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general election]], losing in [[Leicester]], but over the next few months he moved towards the Conservative Party in all but name. His first electoral contest as an Independent candidate, fought under the label of "Independent [[Anti-communism|Anti-Socialist]]," was a narrow loss in [[Westminster Abbey by-election, 1924|a by-election]] in the [[Westminster Abbey (UK Parliament constituency)|Westminster Abbey constituency]] <U+2014> his third electoral defeat in less than two years.

===Chancellor of the Exchequer===
He was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1924 under [[Stanley Baldwin]] and oversaw Britain's disastrous return to the [[Gold Standard]], which resulted in deflation, unemployment, and the miners' strike that led to the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/budget_99/budget_briefing/279928.stm Budget Blunders: Mr Churchill and the Gold Standard (1925)], [[BBC]] News. Retrieved 02-12-2007</ref> 

His decision, announced in the 1924 Budget, came after long consultation with various economists and the board of the Bank of England. He held a dinner at which the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, Sir [[Otto Niemeyer]] and others argued the case. This decision prompted Keynes  to write ''The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill'', arguing that the return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity in 1925 (<U+00A3>1=$4.86) would lead to a world [[Great Depression|depression]]. Interestingly, the pamphlet did not criticise the decision to return to the gold standard ''per se''. However, the decision was generally popular and seen as 'sound economics' although it was opposed by [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] and the Federation of British Industries.<ref>James op cit p. 207. </ref>

[[Image:Churchill 5.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1927]]
Churchill later regarded this as the greatest mistake of his life; he stated he was not an economist and that he acted on the advice of the Governor of the [[Bank of England]], [[Montagu Norman]]. However in discussions at the time with former Chancellor [[McKenna]], Churchill acknowledged that the return to the gold standard and the resulting 'dear money' policy was economically bad. In those discussions he maintained the policy as fundamentally political - a return to the pre war conditions in which he believed.<ref>James op cit p. 206. </ref> In his speech on the Bill he said "I will tell you what it (the return to the Gold Standard) will shackle us to. It will shackle us to reality."

It was not only the return to the [[Gold Standard]] that later economists, as well as people at the time, criticised in Churchill's time at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Rather it was his [[United Kingdom budget|budget]] measures which, even given the consensus at the time that the budgets should be balanced were attacked as assisting the generally prosperous rentier banking and salaried classes (to which Churchill and his associates generally belonged) at the expense of manufacturers and exporters which were known then to be suffering from imports and from competition in traditional export markets.<ref> H Henderson The Interwar Years and other papers. Clarendon Press </ref> However his 1925 budget was well received by the public and enhanced Churchill's prestige within the government.<ref>Jenkins, p. 404</ref>

The return to the pre-war exchange rate and to the Gold Standard depressed industries. The most affected was the [[coal]] industry. Already suffering from declining output as shipping switched to oil, as basic British industries like cotton came under more competition in export markets, the return to the pre war exchange was estimated to add up to 10% in costs to the industry. In July 1925 a Commission of Inquiry reported generally favouring the [[miners]], rather than the mine owners' position.<ref>Jenkins, p. 405</ref> Attached to the report was a memorandum from Sir [[Josiah Stamp]] stating that the increased difficulties in the coal industry could be entirely explained by the 'immediate and necessary effects of the return to Gold.'<ref>Jenkins, p. 392-417</ref>

Baldwin, with Churchill's support proposed a subsidy to the industry while a Royal Commission prepared a further report. During the [[UK General Strike 1926|General Strike of 1926]], Churchill was reported to have suggested that [[machine gun]]s be used on the striking miners. Churchill edited the Government's newspaper, the ''[[British Gazette]]'', and, during the dispute, he argued that "either the country will break the [[General strike|General Strike]], or the General Strike will break the country." Furthermore, he controversially claimed that the [[Fascism]] of [[Benito Mussolini]] had "rendered a service to the whole world," showing, as it had, "a way to combat subversive forces" <U+2014> that is, he considered the regime to be a bulwark against the perceived threat of [[Communist revolution]]. At one point, Churchill went as far as to call Mussolini the "Roman genius<U+2026> the greatest lawgiver among men."<ref>Picknett, Lynn, Prince, Clive, Prior, Stephen & Brydon, Robert (2002). ''War of the Windsors: A Century of Unconstitutional Monarchy'', p. 78. Mainstream Publishing. ISBN 1-84018-631-3.</ref>

===Political isolation===
The Conservative government was defeated in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 General Election]]. Churchill did not seek election to the Conservative Business Committee, the forerunner to the Shadow Cabinet. Over the next two years, Churchill became estranged from the Conservative leadership over the issues of protective tariffs and [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian Home Rule]], which he bitterly opposed. He further distanced himself from the party as a whole by his friendships with press barons, financiers and people seen as unsound and by his political views. When [[Ramsay MacDonald]] formed the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] in 1931, Churchill was not invited to join the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. He was at the low point in his career, in a period known as "the wilderness years".<ref name=gilbert2>{{cite book | last =Gilbert | first =Martin| title =Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years | publisher =Pimlico | date =2004 | location =London | id = 978-1844134182}}</ref> 

[[Image:John Churchill Marlborough portr<U+00E4>tterad av Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Churchill wrote a biography of his ancestor [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]] in the mid 1930s]]. 
He spent much of the next few years concentrating on his writing, including ''[[Marlborough: His Life and Times]]'' <U+2014> a biography of his ancestor [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]] <U+2014> and ''[[A History of the English Speaking Peoples]]'' (though the latter was not published until well after World War II).<ref name=gilbert2 />  Some historians have shown close parallels  between Churchill's views of Marlborough as a war leader advocating firm policies surrounded by politicians and a wider public who attacked both him personally and his policies and Churchill's own stand against appeasement<ref> Cannadine op cit p 42, James op cit p395-400 In doing so they echo public comments at the time. The ''Daily Express'' referred to Churchill's speech in October 1938 against the Munich agreement as 'an alarmist oration by a man whose mind is soaked in the conquests of Marlborough (quoted in Cannadine idem </ref> .

Though badly hurt when he was struck by a car in New York City on a North American speaking tour, he wrote a profitable article about the experience. He wrote many other articles, collections of speeches and several books- some such as his ''Great Contemporaries'' of lasting worth.  He supported himself largely by his writing and was one of the best paid writers of his time.<ref name=gilbert2 /> 

Nevertheless he was still in financial difficulties, having lost most of his American investments in the Wall Street Crash. He was criticised for holidaying in the Rivieria and America as the guest of such people as Beaverbrook,[[William Randolph Hurst]] and for drinking and gambling with people such as [[Brendan Bracken]] (widely rumoured to be Churchill's illegitimate son) and, until his early death [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]]. <ref> Cannadine op cit. 31-36 </ref>. These attacks were not new; in 1922 Churchill had brought a successful libel action against [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] who had accused Churchill of giving a deliberately  false account of the [[Battle of Jutland]] at the request of Sir [[Ernest Cassel]]. During the trial it emerged Cassel whose company  remained Churchill's publisher had paid for some of the furnishinngs of Churchill's London residence.<ref>ibid 28</ref>

But the fact that Churchill was seen to associate with press barons (who in the case of Rothermere and Beaverbrook campaigned against the Conservative leadership and some Conservative policies), financiers (such as Cassel whom [[Lord Salisbury]] had refused to recommend for a peerage <ref> Cannadine op cit 29)</ref> and people said to be of dubious character (such as Birkenhead)<ref> of whom Lord Salisbury said  "I do not imagine he has many political principles. Poor fellow he will probably drink himself to death" (See generally  [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]] </ref> hurt his career. Historians have referred to a <U+201C>whispering campaign<U+2019> of innuendo based partly on Churchill<U+2019>s associations brought by the Conservative Central Office during this period <ref> Cannadine op cit 37</ref>.

His [[Ideology|political views]], set forth in his 1930 Romanes Election and published as ''Parliamentary Government and the Economic Problem'' (OUP) (republished in 1932 in his collection of essays "Thoughts and Adventures") (in America under the title Amid These Storms) involved abandoning [[universal suffrage]], a return to a property franchise, [[proportional representation]] for the major cities and an economic 'sub parliament'.<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=452 Books Written by Winston Churchill (see Amid these Storms], The Churchill Centre, 2007</ref>

====Indian Independence====
{{see also|Simon Commission|Government of India Act 1935}} 
During the first half of the 1930s, outspoken opposition towards the granting of [[Dominion]] status to India became one of Churchill's major political focuses. Churchill was one of the founders of  the India Defence League, a group dedicated to the preservation of British power in India. In speeches and press articles in this period he forecast widespread British unemployment and civil strife in India should independence be granted to India.<ref>James op cit p. 260. </ref> The Viceroy [[Lord Irwin]] who had been appointed by the prior Conservative Government engaged in the [[Round Table Conference]] in early 1931 and then announced the  Government's policy that India should be granted Dominion Status. In this the Government was supported by the Liberal Party and, officially at least, by the Conservative Party.
[[Image:Gandhi studio 1931.jpg|thumb|right|Though he would later come to respect [[Mohandas Gandhi]] (pictured), Churchill opposed him and the Indian Independence movement in the 1930s, arguing that the Round Table Conference "was a frightful prospect".]]

This support as Churchill later wrote "brought about my breaking point with Mr Baldwin".<ref> The Gathering Storm p. 37. </ref> Churchill denounced the Round Table Conference. He spoke at public meetings in Manchester  and Liverpool in January and  February 1931 respectively. At both he forecast widespread unemployment into the millions and other social and economic problems in England if India became self governing.<ref>James op cit p. 259. </ref> Though he would come to respect [[Mohandas Gandhi]], especially after Gandhi "stood up for the untouchables",<ref>Gilbert, Martin. ''Winston S. Churchill: The Prophet of Truth * 1922-1939''. (c)1976 by C&T Publications, Ltd.: p. 618. </ref>  at a meeting of the West [[Essex]] Conservative Association specially convened so Churchill could explain his position he said , "It is alarming and also nauseating to see Mr Gandhi, a seditious Middle-Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well-known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace...to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor."<ref> ''Ibid.'': p. 390.</ref> He called the Congress leaders "Brahmims who mouth and patter principles of Western Liberalism."<ref> speech on 18th March 1931 quoted in James op cit p. 254. </ref>

In Parliament on 26th January 1931 he attacked the Government's policy saying that the Round Table Conference "was a frightful prospect" and that he would support "effective and real organisms of provisional and local government in the provinces."<ref> 247 House of Commons Debates 5s col 755 </ref> He returned to the  Parliamentary attack on 13th March. Baldwin answered him by quoting Churchill's own speech in winding up the debate for the Lloyd George Coalition government on [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre|Amritsar massacre]] in which Churchill defended the cashiering of General [[Reginald Dyer]]. Baldwin continued by challenging Churchill and his other critics to depose him as leader of the Conservative Party.<ref> Hugh Martin Battle p. 229. </ref>

There were two incidents which damaged Churchill's reputation greatly within the Conservative Party in the period. 

The first  was his speech on the eve of the [[Westminster St George's (UK Parliament constituency)|St George by-election]] in April 1931. In a secure Conservative seat, the official Conservative candidate [[Duff Cooper]] was opposed by an independent Conservative. The independent was supported by [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], Lord Beaverbrook and their respective newspapers. Both [[press baron]]s had tried to urge specific policies on the Conservative Party&mdash;Rothermere opposed Indian home rule, Beaverbrook pressed for [[Tariff Reform]] under the slogan Empire Free Trade. Churchill's speech at the [[Albert Hall]] had been arranged before the date of the by election had been set.<ref> James op cit p. 262. </ref> But he made no attempt to change the date and his speech was seen as a part of the Press Baron's campaign against Baldwin. This was reinforced by Churchill's personal friendship with both  but especially with Beaverbrook who wrote "The primary issue of the by-election will be the leadership of the Conservative Party. If..(the independent candidate wins) Baldwin must go".<ref>letter quoted in A J P Taylor Beaverbrook p.  304. </ref> Baldwin's position was strengthened when Duff Cooper won and when  the civil disobedience campaign in India ceased with the [[Gandhi-Irwin Pact]]

The second issue also affected his reputation within the Parliament as a whole and the nation at large. On 16th April 1934 Churchill claimed in Parliament that Sir [[Samuel Hoare]] and [[Edward George Villiers Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] had pressured the Manchester Chamber of Commerce to change evidence it had given to the Joint Select Committee considering the Government of India Bill in June 1933. On 18th April he successfully moved the matter be referred to the House of Commons Privilege Committee. He tried to cross examine witnesses before the Committee, contrary to the Committee's normal procedure. Churchill himself gave evidence and  [[Austen Chamberlain]] criticised  the manner in which he gave it. Churchill's evidence was meagre and the inquiry reported to the House that there had been no breach. The report was debated on 13th June. Churchill was unable to find a single supporter in the House and the debate ended without a division. [[Leo Amery]] accused him of pressing the matter to bring the government down 
''at all costs he had to be faithful to his chosen motto:'Fiat justicia, ruat caelum'' 

''CHURCHILL translate it''

''AMERY I will translate it into the venacular "If I can trip up Sam [Hoare] the government's bust''.<ref> Rhode James op cit p269-272 </ref>.

Churchill's break with Baldwin was permanent. He never held any office while Baldwin was in Parliament. In 1947 Churchill  said "I wish Stanley Baldwin no ill, but it would have been much better had he never lived." In the  index to the ''Gathering Storm'', Churchill's first volume of his History of World War Two, he  records  Baldwin "admitting to putting party before country" for his alleged admission that he would not have won the 1935 Election if he had pursued a more aggressive policy of rearmament. Churchill selectively quotes a speech in the Commons by Baldwin and gives the false impression that Baldwin is speaking of the general election when he was speaking of a by election in 1933 and omits altogether Baldwin's actual comments about the 1935 election "we got from the country, a mandate for doing a thing [a substantial rearmament programme] that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible".<ref>Robert Rhodes James, ''Churchill: A Study in Failure'' (Pelican, 1973), p. 343.</ref> This canard had been first put forward in the first edition of [[Guilty Men]] but in subsequent editions (including those before Churchill wrote the Gathering Storm) had been corrected.<ref> for full discussion see  R Basset"Telling the truth to the People: the myth of the Baldwin "confession' ''Cambridge Journal'' November 1948 </ref>

Churchill continued his campaign against any further transfer of power to Indians. He continued to predict bloodshed in India and mass unemployment at home. His speeches often quoted nineteenth century politicians and his own policy was to maintain the existing Raj.

Some historians see his basic attitude to India as being set out in his ''My Early Life'' which was published in 1930.<ref> James op cit p. 258. </ref>. Historians also dispute his motives in maintaining his opposition. Some see him as trying to destabilise the National Government. In this they follow Amery (see above) and Lloyd George who believed that with MacDonald ill and Churchill leading the Conservative right wing Baldwin would have to form a new Coalition in which both he and Churchill would have key ministries. <ref> Peter Rowland ''Lloyd George'' Barrie & Jenkins 1975 pp710 -712 </ref>. 

Some historians also draw a parallel between his attitudes to India and those towards the Nazis.For example Manfred Weidhorn in the introduction to  the American edition of ''India'' (a collection of Churchill<U+2019>s speeches on the topic) writes. "... Machiavelli sheds light on Churchill. The Italian notes that virtues and vices are often symbiotic rather than antithetical. Thus people say, 'Hannibal was a great general - too bad he was cruel', when the likelihood is that Hannibal was great in part because he was cruel. So here we have to consider the probability that Churchill was great in 1940 in part because he was too pugnacious, stubborn, deluded, and conservative (in the deepest sense) to be able to adjust to the New Order in Europe - traits he had shown in the matter of India". <ref> Churchill ''India'' Thornton Butterworth, London 1931; facsimile edition with introduction by M Weidhorn Dragonwyck Publishing 1990 </ref>

====German Rearmament====
Beginning in 1932 when he opposed those who advocated giving Germany the right to military parity with France, Churchill spoke often of the dangers of Germany's rearmament.<ref> James op cit pp. 285-6. </ref> He later, particularly in ''The Gathering Storm'', tried to portray himself as being for a time,  a lone voice calling on Britain to strengthen itself to counter the belligerence of Germany.<ref>Picknett, et al., p. 75.</ref> However [[George Ambrose Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd|Lord Lloyd]] was the first to so agitate.<ref>  Lord Lloyd and the decline of the British Empire J Charmley pp. 1,2, 213ff </ref>

Churchill's attitude toward the Fascist dictators was ambiguous. In 1931 he warned against the League of Nations opposing the Japanese in Manchuria "I hope we shall try in England to understand the position of Japan an ancient state...On the one side they have the dark menace of Soviet Russia. On the other the chaos of China four or five provinces of which are being tortured under Communist rule".<ref> James op cit p. 329  quoting Churchill's speech in the Commons </ref> In contemporary newspaper articles he referred to the Spanish Republican government as a communist front, and Franco's army as the "Anti red movement'.<ref> James op cit p. 408. </ref> He supported the [[Hoare-Laval Pact]] and continued up until 1937 to praise Mussolini.<ref> A J P Taylor Beaverbrook Hamish Hamilton 1972 p. 375. </ref> In his 1937 book "Great Contemporaries", Churchill wrote: "One may dislike Hitler's system and yet admire his patriotic achievements.  If our country were defeated, I hope we should find a champion as admirable (as [[Hitler]]) to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations". Speaking in the House of Commons, in 1937, he said "I will not pretend that, if I had to choose between communism and Nazism, I would choose communism". In the same work, Churchill expressed a hope that despite Hitler's apparent dictatorial tendencies, he would use his power to rebuild Germany into a worthy member of the world community. 

Churchill's first major speech on defence on 7th February 1934 stressed the need to rebuild the Royal Air Force and to create a Ministry of Defence, his second, on 13th July urged a renewed role for the League of Nations. These three topics remained his themes till early 1936. In 1935 he was one of the founding members of "Focus" a group which also included Sir Archibald Sinclair, Lady [[Violet Bonham Carter, Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury|Violet Bonham Carter]], [[Wickham Steed]] and Professor [[Gilbert Murray]]. Focus brought together people of differing political backgrounds and occupations who were united in seeking 'the defence of freedom and peace'.<ref> for a history of Focus see E Spier ''Focus'' Wolff 1963 </ref> Focus led to the formation of the much wider Arms and the Covenant Movement in 1936.

Churchill was holidaying in Spain when the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Germans reoccupied the Rhineland]] in February of that year and returned to a divided England where the Labour opposition was adamant in opposing sanctions and the National Government divided between advocates of economic sanctions and those who said that even these would lead to a humiliating backdown by Britain as France would not support any intervention.<ref> Harold Nicholson's letter to his wife on 13th March summed up the situation " If we send an ultimatum to Germany she ought in all reason to climb down. But  then she will not climb down and we shall have war... The people of this country absolutely refuse to have a war. We would be faced with a general strike if we suggested such a thing. We shall therefore have to climb down ignominiously  " ''Diaries and Letters 1930-1939'' p. 249.</ref>  Churchill's speech on 9th March was measured and praised by [[Neville Chamberlain]] as constructive. But within weeks Churchill was passed over for the post of [[Minister for Co-ordination of Defence]] in favour of the Attorney General Sir [[Thomas Inskip]].<ref> James op cit pp. 333-337. </ref>

This surprising appointment- it surprised Inskip as much as anyone - came despite advice to Baldwin to broaden his cabinet. Historians have variously seen it as Baldwin's caution in not wanting to appoint someone as controversial as Churchill, as avoiding giving Germany any sign that the United Kingdom was preparing for war and as avoiding someone who had few allies in the Conservative Party and was opposed as a war monger by many people in England.<ref> A P Herbert for example wrote "I did think he rather enjoyed a war and after three years in the trenches in  Gallipoli and France, I did not" [[A P Herbert]] ''Independent Member'' p. 108. </ref> Whatever the reason it was a severe blow to Churchill.<ref name=gilbert2 />

In June 1936 he organised a deputation of senior Conservatives who shared his concern to see Baldwin, Chamberlain and Halifax. He had tried to have delegates from the other two parties and later wrote "If the leaders of the Labour and Liberal oppositions had come with  us there might have been a political situation so intense as to enforce remedial action.<ref> ''The Gathering Storm'' p. 276. </ref> As it was the meeting achieved little, Baldwin arguing that the Government was doing all it could given the anti war feeling of the electorate. But it showed that more Conservatives shared Churchill's views, he was less isolated then he had been earlier.<ref name=gilbert2 />

====Abdication Crisis====
{{main|Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII}}
[[Image:King Edward VIII. (1936).jpg|thumb|right|The response of Churchill in the ''[[Abdication Crisis of Edward VIII|Abdication Crisis]]'' of King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] (pictured) caused severe damage to Churchill's political reputation.]]
In June 1936 [[Walter Monckton]] told Churchill that the rumours that King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] intended to marry Mrs [[Wallis Simpson]]  were true. Churchill then advised against the marriage and said he regarded Mrs Simpson's existing marriage as a 'safeguard'.<ref> Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead '' Walter Monckton '' Weidenfield and Nicholson 1969 p. 129. </ref> In November he declined [[Lord Salisbury]]'s invitation to be part of a delegation of senior Conservative backbenchers which met with Baldwin to discuss the matter. On 25th November he, [[Atlee]] and Sinclair met with Baldwin and were told officially of the King's intention and asked whether they would form an administration if Baldwin and the National Government resigned should the King not take the Ministry's advice. Both Atlee and Sinclair said they would not take office if invited to do so. Churchill's reply was that his attitude was a little different but he would support the government.<ref> Middlemas K R and  Barnes J ''Stanley Baldwin''  Weidenfield and Nicholson 1969 p. 999. </ref>

At the time Churchill was seen as an alternative leader. As Lord Beaverbrook wrote "he has emerged as a leader of a big armaments anti-German movement in politics, hostile to the Government".<ref> letter to G Ross cited in A J P Taylor ''Beaverbrook'' Hamish Hamilton 1972 p. 372. </ref>

The Abdication crisis became public, coming to head in the fist fornight of December 1936. At this time Churchill publicly gave his support to the King. The first public meeting of the Arms and the Covenant Movement was on 3rd December. Churchill was a major speaker and later wrote that in replying to the Vote of Thanks he made a declaration 'on the spur of the moment' asking for delay before any decision was made by either the King or his Cabinet.<ref> ''The Gathering Storm'' pp. 170-1. Others including Citrine who chaired  the meeting wrote that Churchill did not make such a speech. Citrine ''Men and Work'' Hutchinson 1964 p. 357.</ref> Later that night Churchill saw the draft of the King's proposed wireless broadcast and spoke with Beaverbrook and the King's solicitor about it.

On 4th December he met with the King and again urged delay. On 5th December he issued a lengthy statement implying that the Ministry was applying unconstitutional pressure on the  King to force him to make a hasty decision.<ref> James op cit pp. 349-351 where the text of the statement is given </ref> On 7th December he tried to address the Commons to plead for delay. He was shouted down. Seemingly staggered by the unanimous hostility of all Members he left.<ref>Beaverbrook, Lord; Edited by A. J. P. Taylor (1966). The Abdication of King Edward VIII. London: Hamish Hamilton.</ref>

Churchill's reputation in Parliament and England as a whole was badly damaged. Some such as [[Alistair Cooke]] saw him as trying to build a King's Party.<ref> Alistair Cook 'Edward VIII' in ''Six Men'' Bodley Head 1977 </ref> Others like [[Harold Macmillan]] were dismayed by the damage Churchill's support for the King had done to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.<ref> H Macmillan ''The Blast of War'' Macmillan 1970 </ref> Churchill himself later wrote "I was myself smitten in public opinion that it was the almost universal view that my political life was ended.<ref> ''The Gathering Storm'' p. 171. </ref>

Historians are divided about Churchill's motives in his support for Edward VIII. Some such as [[A J P Taylor]] see it as being an attempt to 'overthrow the government of feeble men'.<ref> A J P Taylor ''English History (1914-1945)'' Hamish Hamilton 1961 p. 404. </ref> Others such as Rhode James see  Churchill's motives as entirely honourable and disinterested, that he felt deeply for the King.<ref> James op cit p. 353. </ref>

===Return from Exile===
Churchill later sought to portray himself as an isolated voice. While it is true that he had little following in the House of Commons during much of the 1930s he was given considerable privileges by the Government. The <U+201C>Churchill group<U+201D> in the later half of the decade consisted only of himself, [[Duncan Sandys]] and [[Brendan Bracken]]. It was isolated from the other main factions within the Conservative Party pressing for faster rearmament and a stronger foreign policy.<ref>These factions were headed by [[Anthony Eden]] and [[Leo Amery]] Rhode James op cit p 428</ref> 

In some senses the <U+2018>exile<U+2019> was more apparent then real.  Churchill continued to be consulted on many matters by the Government or seen as an alternative leader  <ref> he was  so consulted and so regarded during the Abdication Crisis see footnotes above </ref>. More importantly however [[Lord Swinton]] as Secretary of State for Air, and with Baldwin<U+2019>s approval gave Churchill access to official and otherwise secret information. Swinton did so, knowing Churchill would remain a critic of the government but believing that an informed critic was better then one relying on rumour and hearsay.<ref> Rhode James op cit p 316-8</ref> 

Churchill was a fierce critic of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] of Hitler, leading the wing of the Conservative Party that opposed the [[Munich Agreement]] which Chamberlain famously declared to mean "peace in our time".<ref>Picknett, et al., pp. 149<U+2013>50.</ref>  In a speech to the House of Commons, he bluntly (and prophetically) stated, "You were given the choice between war and dishonour.  You chose dishonour, and you will have war."<ref> ''Current Biography 1942'', p. 155. </ref>

==Role as wartime Prime Minister==
==="Winston is back"===
After the outbreak of the [[World War II]] Churchill was appointed [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] and a member of the War Cabinet, just as he was in the first part of the [[World War I]]. The Navy, according to myth, sent out the signal: "Winston is back."<ref name="papers-bio">{{cite web

In this job, he proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called "[[Phony War]]", when the only noticeable action was at sea. Churchill advocated the pre-emptive occupation of the neutral Norwegian [[Iron ore|iron-ore]] port of [[Narvik]] and the iron mines in [[Swedish iron ore during World War II|Kiruna]], [[Sweden]], early in the War. However, Chamberlain and the rest of the [[War Cabinet]] disagreed, and the operation was delayed until the successful [[Norwegian campaign|German invasion of Norway]].

===Bitter beginnings of the war===
[[Image:Wc0107-04780r.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill wears a helmet during an air raid warning in the [[Battle for Britain]] in 1940]]
On [[10 May]] [[1940]], hours before the German invasion of France by a [[Blitzkrieg|lightning advance]] through the [[Low Countries]], it became clear that, following failure in Norway, the country had no confidence in Chamberlain's prosecution of the war and so Chamberlain resigned. The commonly accepted version of events states that [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] turned down the post of Prime Minister because he believed he could not govern effectively as a member of the [[House of Lords]] instead of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although traditionally, the Prime Minister does not advise the King on the former's successor, Chamberlain wanted someone who would command the support of all three major parties in the House of Commons. A meeting between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill and [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]], the government [[Chief Whip]], led to the recommendation of Churchill, and, as a constitutional monarch, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] asked Churchill to be Prime Minister and to form an all-party government. Churchill's first act was to write to Chamberlain to thank him for his support.<ref>Self, Robert (2006). ''Neville Chamberlain: A Biography'', p. 431. Ashgate. ISBN 9-780754-656159.</ref>

Churchill's greatest achievement was his refusal to capitulate when defeat seemed imminent, and he remained a strong opponent of any negotiations with [[Germany]] throughout the war. Few others in the Cabinet had this degree of resolve. Although there was an element of British public and political sentiment favouring negotiated peace with a clearly ascendant Germany, among them the [[Foreign Secretary]] [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], Churchill nonetheless refused to consider an armistice with Hitler's Germany.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 11.</ref> Churchill's skillful use of [[rhetoric]] hardened [[public opinion]] against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British for a long war.<ref>Jenkins, p. 616-46</ref> Coining the general term for the upcoming battle, Churchill stated in his [[This was their finest hour|"finest hour"]] speech to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on [[18 June]] [[1940]], "I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."<ref>Jenkins, p. 621</ref> By refusing an armstice with Germany, Churchill kept resistance alive in the [[British Empire]] and created the basis for the later [[Allies of World War II|Allied counter-attacks]] of 1942-45, with Britain serving as a platform for the supply of [[Soviet Union]] and the liberation of [[Western Europe]].
[[Image:Wc0106-3a18421r.jpg|thumb|right|Winston Churchill walks through the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, 1942]]

In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]]. He immediately put his friend and confidant, the industrialist and newspaper baron [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], in charge of aircraft production. It was Beaverbrook's business acumen that allowed Britain to quickly gear up aircraft production and engineering that eventually made the difference in the war.<ref>Allen, Hubert Raymond. Who Won the Battle of Britain? London: Arthur Barker, 1974. ISBN 0-213-16489-2.</ref>

Churchill's speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British. His first speech as Prime Minister was the famous "''I have nothing to offer but [[blood, toil, tears, and sweat]]''". He followed that closely with two other equally famous ones, given just before the [[Battle of Britain]]. One included the immortal words:

<blockquote>
<p>we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, [[we shall fight on the beaches]], we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.<ref name = "centre-beaches">{{cite web

</p></blockquote>
The other included the equally famous:

[[Image:Brooke - Churchill - Montgomery.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill with Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] and Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke]], 1944]]
At the height of the Battle of Britain, his bracing survey of the situation included the memorable line "''Never in the field of human conflict was [[so much owed by so many to so few]]''", which engendered the enduring nickname "[[The Few]]" for the Allied fighter pilots who won it.<ref>Speech to the House of Commons on [[20 August]] [[1940]]</ref> One of his most memorable war speeches came on [[10 November]] [[1942]] at the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at [[Mansion House]] in [[London]], in response to the Allied victory at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Churchill stated famously: 

<blockquote>
<p>This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.<ref name = "centre-endofthebeginning">{{cite web

Without having much in the way of sustenance or good news to offer the [[Briton|British people]], he took a [[political risk]] in deliberately choosing to emphasise the dangers instead. 

"''Rhetorical power,''" wrote Churchill, "''is neither wholly bestowed, nor wholly acquired, but cultivated.''"  Not all were impressed by his oratory. Robert Menzies, who was the Prime Minister of Australia, said during World War II of Churchill: "His real tyrant is the glittering phrase so attractive to his mind that awkward facts have to give way."<ref>{{cite web |last= Menzies| first=Robert|url=http://www.oph.gov.au/menzies/churchillandthewarcabinet.htm |title=Menzies; 1941 War Diary - Churchill and the War Cabinet |accessdate=2007-12-23}}</ref> Another associate wrote: "He is . . . the slave of the words which his mind forms about ideas. . . .

===Relations with the United States===
[[Image:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in 1943]]
His good relationship with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] secured vital food, oil and munitions via the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]] shipping routes. It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was [[United States presidential election, 1940|re-elected in 1940]]. Upon re-election, Roosevelt immediately set about implementing a new method of providing military hardware and shipping to Britain without the need for monetary payment. Put simply, Roosevelt persuaded Congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the USA; and so [[Lend-lease]] was born. Churchill had 12 strategic [[List of World War II conferences|conferences]] with Roosevelt which covered the [[Atlantic Charter]], [[Europe first]] strategy, the [[Declaration by the United Nations]] and other war policies. 
[[Image:Churchill-in-quebec-1944-23-0201a.gif|thumb|Winston Churchill at the Quebec conference]]

The Russians referred to him as the "British Bulldog".

Churchill's health was fragile, as shown by a mild [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] he suffered in December 1941 at the White House and also in December 1943 when he contracted pneumonia.  Despite this, he travelled over {{convert|100000|mi|km|-4}} throughout the war to meet other national leaders.  For security, he usually travelled using the alias Colonel Warden.<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:Wc0196.jpg|thumb|Churchill on his visit to America addresses a joint session of the United States Congress, 1943]]
Churchill was party to treaties that would redraw post-World War II European and Asian boundaries. These were discussed as early as 1943. Proposals for European boundaries and settlements were officially agreed to by [[Harry S Truman]], Churchill, and [[Stalin]] at [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. At the second [[Quebec Conference]] in 1944 he drafted and together with U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed a toned down version of the original [[Morgenthau Plan]], where they pledged to convert Germany after its [[unconditional surrender]] "''into a country primarily agricultural and pastoral in its character.''"<ref>Michael R. Beschloss, (2002) <U+2018><U+2019>The Conquerors<U+2019><U+2019> : p. 131.</ref>  Churchill's strong relationship with Harry Truman was also of great significance to both countries.  While he clearly regretted the loss of his close friend and counterpart Franklin D. Roosevelt, Churchill was enormously supportive of Truman in his first days in office, calling him, "the type of leader the world needs when it needs him most."

===Relations with the Soviet Union===
[[Image:Yalta Conference.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill at Yalta Conference, with Roosevelt and Stalin beside him]]
When [[Operation Barbarossa|Hitler invaded the Soviet Union]], Winston Churchill, a vehement anti-Communist, famously stated "If Hitler were to invade Hell, I should find occasion to make a favourable reference to the Devil," regarding his policy toward Stalin. Soon, British supplies and tanks were flowing to help the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Stokesbury  | first =James L.  | title =A Short History of WWII  | publisher =William Morrow and Company, Inc.  | date =1980  | location =New York  | pages =159  | id =  0-688-03587-6}}</ref>

The settlement concerning the borders of Poland, that is,  the [[Curzon line|boundary between Poland and the Soviet Union]] and [[Oder-Neisse line|between Germany and Poland]], was viewed as a betrayal in Poland during the post-war years, as it was established against the views of the [[Polish government in exile]]. It was Winston Churchill, who tried to motivate [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Miko<U+0142>ajczyk|Miko<U+0142>ajczyk]], who was Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, to accept Stalin's wishes, but Miko<U+0142>ajczyk refused. Churchill was convinced that the only way to alleviate tensions between the two populations was the transfer of people, to match the national borders. As he expounded in the House of Commons on [[15 December]] 1944, "Expulsion is the method which, insofar as we have been able to see, will be the most satisfactory and lasting. There will be no mixture of populations to cause endless trouble... A clean sweep will be made.

Churchill opposed the effective annexation of Poland by the Soviet Union and wrote bitterly about it in his books, but he was unable to prevent it at the conferences.

During October 1944, he and Eden were in [[Moscow]] to meet with the Russian leadership.  At this point, Russian forces were beginning to advance into various eastern European countries.  Churchill held the view that until everything was formally and properly worked out at Yalta, there had to be a temporary, war-time, working agreement with regard to who would run what.  Churchill suggested that Stalin had an 90 percent interest in [[Romania]], Britain an 90 percent interest in [[Greece]], both [[Russia]] and Britain a 50 percent interest in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Hungary]] and in [[Bulgaria]], a 75% Russian interest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Churchill | first = Winston | title = The Second World War | publisher = Penguin | date = 1989 | location = London | page = 852 | id = 0-14-012836-0}}</ref>  Stalin agreed.

===Dresden bombings controversy===
{{Main|Bombing of Dresden in World War II}}
Between [[February 13]] and [[February 15]] [[1945]], British and the U.S. bombers attacked the German city of Dresden, which was crowded with German wounded and refugees<ref>Taylor, Frederick; ''Dresden: Tuesday, [[February 13]], [[1945]]''; [http://www.gallerybooks.com/bkm/wob040125.html US review], NY: HarperCollins, ISBN 0-06-000676-5; [http://www.bloomsbury.com/BookCatalog/ProductItem.asp?S=&isbn=0747570787 UK review], London: Bloomsbury, ISBN 0-7475-7078-7. pp. 262<U+2013>4.  There were an unknown number of refugees in Dresden, so the historians Matthias Neutzner, G<U+00F6>tz Bergander and Frederick Taylor have used historical sources and deductive reasoning to estimate that the number of refugees in the city and surrounding suburbs was around 200,000 or less on the first night of the bombing.</ref> Because the cultural importance of the city, and the of the number of [[civilian casualties]] close to the end of the war, this remains one of the most controversial Western Allied actions of the war. Following the bombing Churchill stated in a top secret telegram: 
{{quotation|It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed." "...I feel the need for more precise concentration upon military objectives such as oil and communications behind the immediate battle-zone, rather than on mere acts of terror and wanton destruction, however impressive."<ref>After the devastation of [[Dresden]] by aerial bombing, and the resulting fire storm (February 1945) ; quoted in Where the Right Went Wrong (2004) by Patrick J Buchanan, p119</ref>}}

On reflection, under pressure from the Chiefs of Staff and in response to the views expressed by Sir [[Charles Portal]] ([[Chief of the Air Staff]],) and [[Arthur Harris]] ([[Air Officer Commanding|AOC-in-C]] of [[Bomber Command]],) among others, Churchill withdrew his memo and issued a new one.<ref name="Longmate-346">Longmate, Norman (1983). "The Bombers", Hutchins & Co. p. 346. Harris quote as source: Public Records Office ATH/DO/4B quoted by Lord Zuckerman "From Apes to Warlords" p. 352.</ref><ref name= "Taylor-432-433">*Taylor, Frederick (2004). ''Dresden: Tuesday, 13 February, 1945'', London: Bloomsbury, ISBN 0-7475-7078-7.  pp. 432,433.</ref>  This final version of the memo completed on [[April 1]] [[1945]], stated:

{{quotation|It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of the so called 'area-bombing' of German cities should be reviewed from the point of view of our own interests. If we come into control of an entirely ruined land, there will be a great shortage of accommodation for ourselves and our allies<U+2026> We must see to it that our attacks do no more harm to ourselves in the long run than they do to the enemy's war effort.<ref name="Longmate-346"/><ref name="Taylor-432-433"/>}}

Ultimately, responsibility for the British part of the attack lay with Churchill, which is why he has been criticised for allowing the bombings to happen. The German [[historical revisionism|revisionist historian]] [[J<U+00F6>rg Friedrich]], claims that "Winston Churchill's decision to [[Area bombing|[area] bomb]] a shattered Germany between January and May 1945 was a war crime."<ref>Luke Harding [http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1067232,00.html German historian provokes row over war photos] in [[The Guardian]], [[October 21]], 2003</ref> and writing in 2006 the philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]] questioned the whole strategic bombing campaign by the RAF presenting the argument that although it was not a war crime it was a moral crime and undermines the Allies contention that they fought a [[Just War]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Grayling| first = A. C.| authorlink = A. C. Grayling| year = 2006 | title = Among the Dead Cities | publisher = Walker Publishing Company Inc | location = New York | id = ISBN 0-8027-1471-4}} pp. 237,238</ref> 

On the other hand, it has also been asserted that Churchills involvement in the bombing of Dresden was based on the strategic and tactical aspects of winning the war. The destruction of Dresden, whilst horrific, was designed to expedite the defeat of [[Germany]]. As the historian [[Max Hastings]] said in an article subtitled, 'the Allied Bombing of Dresden': "I believe it is wrong to describe strategic bombing as a war crime, for this might be held to suggest some moral equivalence with the deeds of the Nazis. Bombing represented a sincere, albeit mistaken, attempt to bring about Germany's military defeat." Furthermore British historian, [[Frederick Taylor (historian)|Frederick Taylor]] asserts that "All sides bombed each other's cities during the war. Half a million Soviet citizens, for example, died from German bombing during the invasion and occupation of Russia. That's roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids. But the Allied bombing campaign was attached to military operations and ceased as soon as military operations ceased."<ref>Charles Hawley.

===The Second World War ends===
[[Image:Churchill waves to crowds.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill waves to crowds in Whitehall on the day he broadcast to the nation that the war with Germany had been won, 8 May 1945]]
In June 1944 the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] invaded [[Battle of Normandy|Normandy]] and pushed the [[Nazi]] forces back into Germany on a broad front over the coming year. After being attacked on three fronts by the Allies, [[Germany]] was soon defeated. On [[May 7]], 1945 at the [[SHAEF]] headquarters in [[Rheims]] [[end of World War II in Europe|the Allies accepted Germany's surrender]]. On the same day in a BBC news flash [[John Snagge]] announced that [[May 8]] would be [[Victory in Europe Day]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/coming_home/cominghome_archive.shtml coming home] [[BBC 4]], 9am to 9.45am,  9 May - 13 May 2005.</ref> On Victory in Europe day Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final cease fire on all fronts in Europe would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_3580000/3580163.stm On this day May 8 1945] BBC.

The people shouted: "No, it is yours", and Churchill then conducted them in the singing of [[Land of Hope and Glory]]. In the evening he made another broadcast to the nation asserting the defeat of [[Japan]] in the coming months.<ref name=gilbert /> The Japanese later surrendered on August 15, 1945.

==After World War II==
Although Churchill's role in World War II had generated him much support from the British population, he had many opponents. He also expressed contempt for a number of popular ideas, in particular creating a system of national [[Publicly-funded health care|public health care]] and improving [[public education]]. Partly as a result of this Churchill was defeated in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|the 1945 election]] by [[Clement Attlee]] and the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>Picknett, et al., p. 190.</ref> Some historians think that many British voters believed that the man who had led the nation so well in war was not the best man to lead it in peace. Others see the election result as a reaction not against Churchill personally, but against the Conservative Party's record in the 1930s under Baldwin and Chamberlain. During the opening broadcast of the [[Political campaign|election campaign]], Churchill astonished many of his admirers by warning that a Labour government would introduce into Britain "some form of Gestapo, no doubt humanely administered in the first instance". Churchill had been genuinely worried during the war by the inroads of state bureaucracy into [[Civil liberties|civil liberty]], and was clearly influenced by [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s anti-totalitarian tract, ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1944).

Winston Churchill was an early supporter of the [[pan-Europeanism]]. In his famous speech at the [[University of Zurich]] in 1946, Winston Churchill called for a "United States of Europe" and the creation of a "Council of Europe". He also participated in the [[Hague Congress]] of 1948, which discussed the future structure and role of this Council of Europe. The [[Council of Europe]] was finally founded as the first European institution through the [[Treaty of London (1949)|Treaty of London]] of [[5 May]] [[1949]] and has its seat in [[Strasbourg]].

[[Image:Wc0256s.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill on the campus grounds of Westminster College with President [[Harry Truman]] in 1946]]
However, this is often seen as his supporting Britain's membership in a [[United States of Europe|united Europe]], which is far from the truth. Rather, he saw Pan [[Europeanism]] as a Franco-German project which would foster cooperation amongst European countries and the rest of the world and prevent war on the European continent. This can be seen in Churchill<U+2019>s landmark refusal to join the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) in 1951 as well as his often quoted speech in which he said of Britain's role with Europe:

<blockquote>
<p>''We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not combined. We are interested and associated but not absorbed.''<ref name="quote-data">{{cite web

 | title = Remembrance Day 2003
 | accessdate = 2007-04-25
 | author = 
 | publisher = Churchill Society London
}}</ref></p></blockquote>

This stance has, arguably, shaped Britain's feelings toward [[European integration]] and its subsequent general ambivalence towards all things Europe. He saw Britain's place as separate from the continent, much more in-line with the countries of the Commonwealth and the Empire and with the United States, the so-called [[Anglosphere]]. As evidenced in his speech at [[Westminster College, Missouri|Westminster College]] in [[Fulton, Missouri|Fulton]], [[Missouri]], given on [[5 March]] [[1946]] where as a guest of [[Harry S. Truman]], he declared:

<blockquote>
<p>''Neither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples. This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States.''<ref name="centre-429">{{cite web

It was also during this speech that he famously popularised the term "The [[Iron Curtain]]":

<blockquote>
<p>''From [[Stettin]] in the Baltic to [[Trieste]] in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and [[Eastern Europe]]. [[Warsaw, Poland|Warsaw]], [[Berlin]], [[Prague]], [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], [[Belgrade]], [[Bucharest]] and [[Sofia]], all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere.''<ref name="centre-429">{{cite web

Churchill was instrumental in giving France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council|United Nations Security Council]] (which provided another European power to counterbalance the Soviet Union's permanent seat).

==Second term==
[[Image:Wc0279.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill with American General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Field Marshal [[Bernard Law Montgomery]] at a meeting of [[NATO]] in October 1951, shortly before Churchill was to become Prime Minister for a second time]]
After Labour's defeat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|General Election of 1951]], Churchill again became Prime Minister. His third government&mdash;after the wartime national government and the brief caretaker government of 1945 &mdash; would last until his resignation in 1955. During this period, he renewed what he called the "[[special relationship]]" between Britain and the United States, and engaged himself in the formation of the post-war order. On racial questions, Churchill was still a late Victorian. He tried in vain to manoeuvre the cabinet into restricting [[West Indies|West Indian]] immigration. "Keep England White" was a good slogan, he told the cabinet in January 1955.<ref>Hennessy, p. 205.</ref> [[Ian Gilmour]] records Churchill saying to him, in 1955, about immigration: "I think it is the most important subject facing this country, but I cannot get any of my ministers to take any notice".<ref>Ian Gilmour, ''Inside Right'' (Hutchinson, 1977), p. 134.</ref>

His domestic priorities were, however, overshadowed by a series of foreign policy crises, which were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power. Being a strong proponent of Britain as an [[Power in international relations|international power]], Churchill would often meet such moments with [[direct action]]. Trying to retain what he could of the Empire, he once stated that, "I will not preside over a dismemberment."<ref>Jenkins p. 843-861</ref> Churchill devoted much of his time in office to international relations and although Churchill did not get on well with President [[Eisenhower]], Churchill attempted to maintain the''special relationship'' with the [[United States]] and he made four official [[transatlantic]] visits to America during his second term as Prime-Minister.<ref>Jenkins p. 847</ref> 

===The Mau Mau Rebellion===
{{main|Mau Mau Uprising}}
In 1951, grievances against the colonial distribution of land came to a head with the [[Kenya Africa Union]] demanding greater representation and [[land reform]]. When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau rebellion]] in 1952. On [[17 August]] [[1952]], a [[state of emergency]] was declared, and British troops were flown to [[Kenya]] to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the ferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil war.<ref>Jenkins p. 843-861</ref> 

In 1953, the Lari massacre, perpetrated by Mau-Mau insurgents against [[Kikuyu]] loyal to the British, changed the political complexion of the rebellion and gave the public-relations advantage to the British. Churchill's strategy was to use a military response, combined with implementing many of the concessions that Attlee's government had blocked in 1951. He ordered an increased military presence and appointed General Sir [[George Erskine]], who would implement Operation Anvil in 1954 that defeated the rebellion in the city of [[Nairobi]]. Churchill ordered peace talks opened, but these collapsed shortly after his leaving office.<ref>Jenkins p. 843-861</ref>

===Malayan Emergency===
[[Image:ChurchillStLaurent1954.jpg|thumb|right|Churchill with Canadian Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]] in 1954]]
{{main|Malayan Emergency}}
{{see also|Vietnam War}}
In [[Malaya]], a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948.<ref name=Malaya>{{cite book | last =Harper| first =T.N.| title =The End of Empire and the Making of Malaya | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date =2001 | location =London| id = 978-0521004657}}</ref>   Once again, Churchill's government inherited a crisis, and once again Churchill chose to use direct military action against those in rebellion while attempting to build an alliance with those who were not.<ref name=gilbert /> He stepped up the implementation of a "[[Hearts and Minds|hearts and minds]]" campaign and approved the creation of fortified villages, a tactic that would become a recurring part of Western [[military strategy]] in [[Southeast Asia|South-east Asia]].<ref name=Stubbs>{{cite book | last =Stubbs| first =Richard| title =Hearts and Minds in Guerilla Warfare: The Malayan Emergency 1948<U+2013>1960 | publisher =Eastern University | date =2001 | location =New York | id = 981210352X }}</ref> 

The [[Malayan Emergency]] was a more direct case of a [[Resistance movement|guerrilla movement]], centred in an [[ethnic group]], but backed by the [[Soviet Union]]. As such, Britain's policy of direct confrontation and military victory had a great deal more support than in Iran or in Kenya. At the highpoint of the conflict, over 40,000 British and Commonwealth troops were stationed in Malaya. While the rebellion was slowly being defeated, it was equally clear that [[Colonialism|colonial rule]] from Britain was no longer plausible.<ref name=Empire2>{{cite book | last =Ferguson| first =Niall| title =Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World | publisher =Penguin Books Ltd | date =2000 | location =London| id = 978-0141007540}}</ref><ref name=Malaya>{{cite book | last =Harper| first =T.N.| title =The End of Empire and the Making of Malaya | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date =2001 | location =London| id = 978-0521004657}}</ref>    

In 1953, plans were drawn up for independence for [[Singapore]] and the other [[British overseas territories|crown colonies]] in the region. The first elections were held in 1955, just days before Churchill's own resignation, and in 1957, under [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Anthony Eden]], Malaya became independent.<ref name=Malaya>{{cite book | last =Harper| first =T.N.| title =The End of Empire and the Making of Malaya | publisher =Cambridge University Press | date =2001 | location =London| id = 978-0521004657}}</ref>

===Stroke===
In June 1953, when he was 78, Churchill suffered a stroke after a meeting with the [[Prime minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Alcide De Gasperi]] at [[10 Downing Street]]. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, [[Chartwell]], to recuperate from the effects of the stroke which had affected his speech and ability to walk.<ref name=gilbert /> He returned to [[Politics|public life]] in October to make a speech at a Conservative Party conference at [[Margate]], having decided that if he couldn't make the speech, he would retire as Prime Minister&mdash;but he was able to deliver it without problems.<ref name=gilbert /><ref>Jenkins, p. 868-71</ref>

Churchill's fondness for [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] was well-documented.<ref name = "centre-99">{{cite web

He was quoted on the subject as saying that "by dint of careful application I learned to like it."  He consumed alcoholic drinks on a near-daily basis for long periods in his life, and frequently imbibed before, after, and during mealtimes. He is not generally however considered by historians to have been an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]. The Churchill Centre states that Churchill made a bet with a man with the [[Family name|last name]] of Rothermere (possibly one of the [[Viscount Rothermere|Viscounts Rothermere]]) in 1936 that Churchill would be able to successfully abstain from drinking [[hard liquor]] for a year;  Churchill apparently won the bet.<ref name = "centre-99">{{cite web

==Retirement and death==
Aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally, Churchill retired as [[Prime Minister]] in 1955 and was succeeded by [[Anthony Eden]], who had long been his ambitious prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> (three years earlier, Eden had married Churchill's niece, Anne [[Clarissa Eden, Countess of Avon|Clarissa Spencer-Churchill]], his second marriage). Upon his resignation, the Queen offered him a [[dukedom]]  but he declined the offer.<ref>By the time Churchill resigned on 4 April, it had been determined that no further dukedoms would be offered except to Royal personages. However a special case was granted to Churchill, after it was understood he would refuse it. Churchill commented ''I very nearly accepted, I was so moved by her beauty and her charm [Queen Elizabeth II] and the kindness with which she made this offer, that for a moment I thought of accepting. But finally I remembered that I must die as I have always been; Winston Churchill. {{cite web |url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=434 |title=FAQ; Was Churchill offered a Dukedom? |accessdate=2007-12-21}}</ref> Over the coming years Churchill spent less time in parliament, occasionally voting in parliamentary divisions, but never again speaking in the House. He continued to serve as an MP for [[Woodford (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodford]] until he stood down for the last time at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 General Elections]]. His private verdict on the [[Suez Crisis|Suez]] fiasco was: "I would never have done it without squaring the Americans, and once I'd started I'd never have dared stop".<ref>Montague Brown, p. 213.</ref> In 1959, he became ''[[Father of the House]]'', the MP with the longest continuous service:  he had already gained the distinction of being the only MP to serve under both [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].  Churchill spent most of his retirement at [[Chartwell]] House in Kent, two miles (3 km) south of Westerham.<ref name=gilbert />

As Churchill's mental and physical faculties decayed, he began to lose the battle he had fought for so long against the "black dog" of [[clinical depression|depression]]. He found some solace in the sunshine and colours of the Mediterranean. He took long holidays with his literary adviser [[Emery Reves]] and Emery's wife, Wendy Russell, at La Pausa, their villa on the [[French Riviera]], seldom joined by Clementine. He also took eight cruises aboard the yacht ''Christina'' as the guest of [[Aristotle Onassis]]. Once, when the ''Christina'' had to pass through the [[Dardanelles]], Onassis gave instructions that it was to do so during the night, so as not to disturb his guest with unhappy memories.<ref>[http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=235 1960 On this day - Trip with Onassis], The Churchill Centre. Retrieved 02-12-2007</ref>

In 1963, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], acting under authorisation granted by an [[Act of Congress]], proclaimed Churchill the first [[Honorary Citizen of the United States]].<ref name = "US Citizen">[http://foia.state.gov/masterdocs/07fam/07fam1170.pdf  Freedom of Information Act document], [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] of the USA.</ref> Churchill was physically incapable of attending the [[White House]] ceremony, so his son and grandson accepted the award for him.

Churchill's final years were melancholy. He never resolved the love<U+2013>hate relationship between himself and his son. Sarah was descending into alcoholism and Diana [[Suicide|committed suicide]] in the autumn of 1963. Churchill suffered a further two strokes during this period.<ref name=gilbert /> Churchill appeared old and sorrow when he stood at the window of his London home, 28 Hyde Park Gate, to greet the photographers on his ninetieth birthday in November 1964.

On [[15 January]] [[1965]], Churchill suffered another stroke&mdash;a severe [[cerebral thrombosis]]&mdash;that left him gravely ill. He died at his home nine days later, at age 90, shortly after eight o'clock on the morning of Sunday [[24 January]] [[1965]], coincidentally 70 years to the day after his father's death.<ref>Jenkins, p. 911</ref>

==Funeral==
[[Image:Winston Churchill Grave.jpg|thumb|right|The Grave of Winston and Clementine Churchill at St Martin's Church, Bladon]]

As his coffin passed down the [[Thames]] on the ''[[Havengore]]'', the cranes of London's [[London Docklands|Docklands]] bowed in a spontaneous salute. The [[Royal Artillery]] fired a [[19-gun salute]] (as [[head of government]]), and the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] staged a fly-by of sixteen [[English Electric Lightning]] fighters. The state funeral was the largest gathering of dignitaries in Britain as representatives from well over 100 countries attended, including [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson]], [[Prime Minister]] of [[Rhodesia]] [[Ian Smith]], former [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and many other heads of state, including past and present heads of state and government, and members of royalty.

At Churchill's request, he was buried in the family plot at [[St Martin's Church, Bladon]], near Woodstock, not far from his birthplace at Blenheim. In the fields along the route, and at the stations through which the train passed, thousands stood in silence to pay their last respects. In 1998 his tombstone had to be replaced due to the large number of visitors over the years having eroded it and its surrounding area. A new stone was dedicated in a ceremony attended by members of the Spencer-Churchill family.<ref>{{cite web

Because the funeral took place on [[30 January]], people in the United States marked it by paying tribute to his friendship with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] because it was the anniversary of FDR's birth. The tributes were led by Roosevelt's children at the president's grave at the [[FDR Presidential Library]].
