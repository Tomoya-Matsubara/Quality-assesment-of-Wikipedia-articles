Flatley kicked a penalty goal for Australia at the 47th minute, following the England scrummage being penalized by referee Andre Watson taking the score to 14-8. With England dominant in possession but lacking in finishing Wilkinson attempted a number of unsuccessful drop goal attempts . England's forwards were again penalized harshly by Watson in the 61st minute, Flatley kicked the penalty goal for Australia .
