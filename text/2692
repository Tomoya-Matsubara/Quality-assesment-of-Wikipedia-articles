The '''Red-necked Grebe''', ''Podiceps grisegena'', is a [[bird migration|migratory]] aquatic bird that is found in the [[Climate_zone#GROUP_C:_Temperate.2Fmesothermal_climates|temperate regions]] of the northern hemisphere. Its wintering habitat is largely restricted to calm waters just beyond the waves around ocean coasts, although some birds may winter on large lakes. [[Grebe]]s (sometimes called "helldivers" in North America) prefer shallow bodies of fresh water such as lakes, marshes or fish-ponds as breeding sites. 

The Red-necked Grebe is a nondescript dusky-grey bird in winter. During the breeding season, it acquires the distinctive red neck plumage, black cap and contrasting pale grey face from which its name was derived. It also has an elaborate [[courtship#Courtship in the animal kingdom|courtship]] display and a variety of loud mating calls. Once paired, it builds a nest from water plants on top of floating vegetation in a shallow lake or bog. 

Like all grebes, the Red-necked is a good swimmer, a particularly swift diver, and responds to danger by diving rather than flying. The feet are positioned far back on the body, near the tail, which makes the bird ungainly on land. It dives for fish or picks insects off vegetation; it also swallows its own feathers, possibly to protect the digestive system. The [[conservation status]] of its two subspecies&mdash;''P. g. grisegena'' found in Europe and western Asia, and the larger ''P. g. holboelii'' in North America and eastern [[Siberia]]&mdash;is evaluated as [[Least Concern]], and the global population is stable or growing.

==Taxonomy==
Grebes are small to medium-large water birds with lobed, rather than webbed, toes. There are several [[genus|genera]], of which the most widespread is ''[[Podiceps]]'' with nine species, one recently extinct. The Red-necked Grebe's closest relative is the fish-eating [[Great Crested Grebe]] of Europe and western Asia.<ref name= Ogilvie8> Ogilvie & Rose (2002) 8&ndash;9</ref> It is possible that the Red-necked Grebe originally evolved in North America and later spread to Europe, where a change of diet to include more insects helped to reduce competition with its larger cousin.<ref name= Johnsgard2> Johnsgard, PA (1987) 130&ndash;135</ref> Fossils of the species dating to the middle [[Pleistocene]] have been found in Italy.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bedetti, C.|year=2001|title=Update Middle Pleistocene fossil birds data from Quartaccio quarry (Vitinia, Italy) - The World of Elephants|pages=18&ndash;22|journal=Proc. 1st Intern. Congress - Rome, October 16-20|url=http://www.cq.rm.cnr.it/elephants2001/pdf/18_22.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>
 
The genus name ''Podiceps'' comes from [[Latin]] ''podicis'', "vent" or "anus", and ''pes'', "foot", and is a reference to the placement of a grebe's legs towards the rear of its body.<Ref name= Ogilvie98> Ogilvie & Rose (2002) 98</ref> The species name ''grisegena'' is from Latin ''griseus'' (grey) and ''gena'' (cheek) and refers to the face pattern of the breeding adult.<ref name= Ogilvie102> Ogilvie & Rose (2002) 102</ref>

The Red-necked Grebe has two subspecies, the [[Subspecies#Nominate subspecies|nominate subspecies]] ''P. g. grisegena'' in Europe and western Asia, and ''P. g. holboelii'' (Holboell's Grebe, named for Danish zoologist [[Carl Peter Holb<U+00F6>ll]]) in North America and eastern [[Siberia]]. The east Asian birds have slightly smaller bills than the American form, although the differences are too small to merit separation as a third subspecies.<Ref name= Ogilvie57> Ogilvie & Rose (2002) 57&ndash;60</ref>

==Description==
The Red-necked Grebe is a medium-large grebe, smaller than the Great Crested Grebe of [[Eurasia]], and the [[Western Grebe|Western]] and [[Clark's Grebe]]s of North America.<ref name = snow17>Snow & Perrin (1998) 17-20</ref><ref name = Sibley> Sibley (2000) 29</ref> The adult of the nominate European subspecies is 40&ndash;50&nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]] (15.7&ndash;19.7&nbsp;[[inch|in]]) long with a 77&ndash;85&nbsp;cm (30.3&ndash;33.5&nbsp;in) average wingspan,<ref name = snow20>Snow & Perrin (1998) 20&ndash;22</ref> and weighs 692&ndash;925&nbsp;[[gram|g]] (25&ndash;33&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]).<ref name = snow20>Snow & Perrin (1998) 20&ndash;22</ref>  In breeding plumage, it has a black cap that extends below the eye, very pale grey cheeks and throat, a rusty red neck, dark grey back and flanks, and white underparts. The eyes are dark brown and the long, pointed bill is black with a yellow base.<ref name= Mullarney>Mullarney ''et al'' 18</ref> 
[[Image:Podiceps grisegena9.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Adult of American subspecies with chick]]

The winter plumage of the Red-necked Grebe is duskier than that of other grebes; its dark grey cap is less defined, and merges into the grey face, and a pale crescent that curves around the rear of the face contrasts with the rest of the head. The front of the neck is whitish or light grey, the hind neck is darker grey, and the yellow of the bill is less obvious than in summer.<ref name= Mullarney>Mullarney ''et al'' 18</ref> Although the Red-necked Grebe is unmistakable in breeding plumage, it is less distinctive in winter and can be confused with similar species. It is larger than the  [[Slavonian Grebe|Slavonian (Horned) Grebe]], with a relatively larger bill and a grey, rather than white face.<ref name = cornell/> It is closer in size to the Eurasian Great Crested Grebe, but that species is longer-necked, has a more contrasting head pattern, and always shows white above the eye.<ref name= Mullarney/>

The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male averages heavier than the female.<ref name = snow20/> Chicks have a striped head and breast, and older [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] have a striped face, diffuse blackish cap, pale red neck and extensive yellow on the bill.<ref name= Mullarney/>

The subspecies ''P. g. holboelii'' is larger than the nominate race at 43&ndash;56&nbsp;cm (17&ndash;22&nbsp;in) length, with a 61&ndash;88&nbsp;cm (24&ndash;35&nbsp;in) wingspan, and a weight of 750&ndash;1,600&nbsp;g (27&ndash;57&nbsp;oz).<ref name= Ogilvie92>Ogilvie & Rose (2002) 92</ref> The plumages are the same as those of the nominate race, although the adult's bill is more extensively yellow.<ref name = cornell>{{cite web| author = | title=Red-necked Grebe | work=BirdFacts | url= http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Red-necked_Grebe_dtl.html | publisher= Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology| }} Retrieved 26 August 2008 </ref> The difference in size between the sexes is greater than for this subspecies that for ''P. g. grisegena''.<ref name= Ogilvie57/>

The Red-necked Grebe flies with its long neck extended and its large feet trailing behind the body, which gives it a stretched-out appearance.<ref name= Fjeldsa2> Fjeldsa (2004) 140</ref> The relatively small wings are grey with white [[Flight_feathers#Secondaries|secondaries]], and beat very rapidly.<ref name= Mullarney/> Its small wing area means that the grebe is unable to take off from land,<ref name= Fjeldsa31> Fjeldsa (2004) 31</ref> and needs a lengthy run across water to gain the speed needed for take-off.<ref name= Johnsgard4> Johnsgard (1987)  26&ndash;36</ref> Like all grebes, the Red-necked is an expert swimmer; it uses its feet for propulsion underwater, and steers by rotating its legs, since its tail is too short for this purpose.<ref name= Fjeldsa3> Fjeldsa (2004) 10</ref>

This is one of the most vocal grebes during the breeding season, but, like its relatives, it is mainly silent for the rest of the year. It has a loud, wailing or howling display call ''uooooh'', given by a single bird or a pair in duet, by night or during the day, and often from cover. Long sequences of up to 60&nbsp;consecutive notes may be delivered during singing encounters between rival territorial birds. A great variety of quacking, clucking, hissing, rattling and purring calls are also given, with much individual variation.<ref name = snow20/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Podiceps griseigena 2-4c.jpg|thumb|A breeding adult of the nominate subspecies]]
Breeding takes place in shallow freshwater lakes, bays of larger lakes, marshes, and other inland bodies of water, often less than 3&nbsp;[[hectare|ha]] (6&nbsp;[[acre]]s) in extent and  less than 2&nbsp;[[metre|m]] (6&nbsp;[[feet|ft]]) deep. The Red-necked Grebe shows a preference for waters in forested areas or, further north, in shrub [[tundra]], and favours sites with abundant [[Emergent plant|emergent vegetation]], such as [[reed bed|reedbeds]].<ref name=BirdLife>{{cite web | title = BirdLife International Species factsheet: ''Podiceps grisegena'' | author= | publisher =BirdLife International | url =http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=3638&m=0 | }} Retrieved 12 August 2008</ref> The best breeding habitat is fish-ponds, which have an abundance of food in addition to meeting the other requirements.<ref name= Kloskowski >{{cite journal || last=  Kloskowski | first= Janusz | coauthors= | month= | year=2004 | title= Food provisioning in red-necked grebes (''Podiceps grisegena'') at common carp (''Cyprinus carpio'') ponds | journal= Hydrobiologia | volume=525 | issue= | pages=131&ndash;138 |}}</ref> The American subspecies is less tied to a high aquatic plant density, and sometimes breeds on quite open lakes.<ref name = Johnsgard2/>

All populations are migratory and winter mainly at sea, usually in estuaries and bays, but often well offshore where fish are within diving reach near shallow banks or islands.<Ref name= Ogilvie57/> The preferred passage and wintering habitat is water less than 15&nbsp;m (50&nbsp;ft) deep with a sand or gravel bottom, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed.<ref name=BirdLife/> During winter, birds typically feed alone and rarely aggregate into flocks, but on migration, concentrations of over 2,000&nbsp;individuals may occur at favoured staging sites.<ref name=BirdLife/> Migration is usually at night, but may occur during the day, especially when over water. This is particularly noticeable in autumn on the Great Lakes, when up to 18,000&nbsp;birds may pass [[Whitefish Bay|Whitefish Point]] on [[Lake Superior]]; these are thought to be Canadian breeders heading for the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to winter. This easterly route is longer than that to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], but avoids the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]].<ref name = Ogilvie57/>

The breeding range of the Red-necked Grebe overlaps with that of the Slavonian Grebe, although the latter species tends to be displaced from sites suited to both. The Red-necked Grebe prefers an inland temperate climate, and is less successful near coasts and in subarctic and warm temperate zones. It is usually a lowland bird, breeding below 100&nbsp;m (330&nbsp;ft), although has nested at up to 1800&nbsp;m (5,900&nbsp;ft) in [[Turkey]].<ref name = snow20/> 

The nominate subspecies breeds from southern [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] through central and eastern Europe east to western Siberia, and winters mainly in the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s, with smaller numbers in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Black Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and on inland lakes.<ref name= Harrison>Harrison (1988) 217</ref> ''P. g. holboelii'' breeds in North America in [[Alaska]], western and central [[Canada]], and the northern [[USA]] east to [[Minnesota]]; in Asia it nests in eastern Siberia from [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] south to [[Hokkaid<U+014D>|Hokkaido]] and west to [[Mongolia]]. The Asian birds winter at sea from [[Japan]] to the [[East China Sea]], and American breeders winter in the Pacific, mainly from southern Alaska to [[British Columbia]] (with smaller numbers south to [[California]]), and in the Atlantic from [[Newfoundland]] to [[Florida]]. Some birds remain on the [[Great Lakes]] if they are sufficiently ice-free.<ref name= Harrison/> This species occurs as a winter [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] in Israel,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israbirding.com/irdc/bulletins/bulletin_2.2/|accessdate=|publisher=The Israeli Rarities and Distribution Committee|title=Bulletin 2:02}}</ref> Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rasmussen, PC & JC Anderton|year=2005|isbn=8487334679|title=Birds of South Asia.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding and survival===

Red-necked Grebes usually nest as isolated pairs with more than 50&nbsp;m (160&nbsp;ft) between neighbouring nests, although semi-colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites, where up to 20&nbsp;pairs each defend a linear territory.<ref name = BirdLife/> Semi-colonial breeding is more likely to occur in prime locations, such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline. Such sites, safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection, have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders, down to 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft).<ref name= Sachs >{{cite journal || last= Sachs | first= Joel  l. | coauthors= Hughes, Colin  R.; Nuechterlein, Gary  L.; Buitron, Deborah | month= | year=2007 | title= Evolution of coloniality in birds: a test of hypotheses with the red-necked grebe {''Podiceps grisena'') | journal= The Auk | volume= 124| issue= 2| pages=628&ndash;642 |}}</ref> Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods.<ref name= Nuechterlein>{{cite journal| last= Nuechterlein | first= Gary L. | coauthors=  Buitron, Deborah; Sachs, Joel L.; Hughes, Colin R. | month= February | year=2003 | title= Red-necked grebes become semicolonial when prime nesting substrate is available | journal= The Condor | volume=105 | issue=1 | pages=80&ndash;94 | url = |format =  | doi =  |}}</ref> The territory is defended with various threat displays, including wing-spreading, hunching, and bill-thrusting;<ref name= cornell/> pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive, less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move out of sight of the colony when not incubating.<ref name= Klatt>{{cite journal || last= Klatt | first= Paul H.  | coauthors= Nuechterlein, Gary L.; Buitron, Deborah | year=1999 | title= Frequency and distribution of behaviour of red-necked grebes breeding colonially and in classic territories | journal= Behaviour | volume= 141 | issue= | pages= 263&ndash;277|}}</ref> Breeding is often in loose association with [[gull]]s or other colonial water birds.<ref name=snow20/> 
[[Image:L<U+00FC>tt-Witt Moor-2.jpg|thumb|left|Breeding areas must have emergent vegetation]]
The [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair forms in April or May on migration or at the breeding water, and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences.<ref name=snow20/> The elaborate breeding performance includes head-shaking, a head-lowered "cat" display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a "penguin" dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast.<ref name=snow20/><ref name= Mullarney/><ref name= cornell/>

Like all grebes, the Red-necked Grebe nests near water into which it can escape, since the position of the legs far back on the body prevents fast movement on land. It often breeds further within reed beds than other grebes. The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation,<ref name=snow20/> in water 0.5&ndash;0.75&nbsp;m (19&ndash;29&nbsp;in) deep, and with the bulk of nest below the water line.<ref name= Johnsgard2/> Egg-laying mainly takes place from mid-April to May in Europe,<ref name= snow17/> and somewhat later, from mid-May to June, in North America.<ref name= Johnsgard2/> Parents may leave the nest for significant periods of time during the night, possibly to evade nocturnal predators. It is unclear whether this is for self-protection or to protect the eggs by diverting attention from the nest; the clutch does not appear to suffer from this temporary abandonment, whatever the reason.<ref name= Jablow >{{cite journal || last= Jablow | first= Valerie | coauthors= | month= April | year=2003 | title= Bringing Up Baby: Scientists zero in on the caring and cunning ways of a seldom-seen waterbird | journal= Smithsonian | volume=34, | issue=1 | pages=333&ndash;337 | doi =}}</ref>
[[Image:Podiceps cristatus 3 (Lukasz Lukasik).jpg|right|thumb|Chicks on a parents back]]
The Red-necked Grebe lays four or five (range one to nine) dull white or pale blue eggs, which average 3.4&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;in) in breadth, 51&nbsp;cm (2.0&nbsp;in) in length, and weigh about 30.5&nbsp;g (1.1&nbsp;oz), of which 10% is shell.<ref name =BTO>{{cite web| title= Red-necked Grebe ''Podiceps grisegena'' (Boddaert, 1783)|work= Bird facts |url= http://blx1.bto.org/birdfacts/results/bob100.htm |publisher=[[British Trust for Ornithology]] | }} Retrieved 14 August 2008</ref> Parents take turns to [[avian incubation|incubate]] the eggs for 21&ndash;33&nbsp;days until the [[precocial]] downy chicks hatch;<ref name=snow20/> they immediately climb onto the parent's back, where they spend most of their time until they are 10&ndash;17&nbsp;days old.<ref name = cornell/><ref name= ogilvie94>Ogilvie & Rose (2002) 94</ref> The young may be fed by the parents for up to 54&nbsp;days after fledging,<ref name= Johnsgard2/> and can fly at 50&ndash;70&nbsp;days.<ref name= ogilvie94/> The parents do not interfere with the feeding of their chicks when they are still being carried. Later they care for the younger chicks for longer, and are aggressive with the older offspring.

===Feeding===
On the breeding grounds, the Red-necked Grebe feeds mainly on [[invertebrate]]s including adult and [[larva]]l aquatic insects, such as [[water beetle]]s and [[dragonfly]] larvae, [[crayfish]] and [[mollusc]]s. Fish (such as [[smelt]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Piersma, T|year=1988|title=Body size, nutrient reserves and diet of red-necked and Slavonian grebes ''Podiceps grisegena'' and ''P. auritus'' on Lake IJsselmeer, The Netherlands|journal=Bird Studies|volume=35|issue=1|pages=13&ndash;24}}</ref>) may be important locally or seasonally, especially for the American subspecies, and [[crustacean]]s can constitute up to 20% of the grebe's diet. Birds breeding at the coast often make foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas to feed.<ref name= BirdLife/>
 
[[Image:Podiceps grisegena -chick in Alaska-6-4c.jpg|left|thumb|Chicks are fed by the parents for several weeks.]]
Aquatic prey is obtained by diving or by swimming on surface with the head submerged, and terrestrial insects and their larvae are picked off vegetation.<ref name=snow20/> A line   slanting  downward   from   the  eye to  the  tip  of  the  opened  lower  mandible may be used for sighting on prey before diving or when  swimming under water.

Like other grebes, the Red-necked Grebe ingests large quantities of its own feathers, which remain in the bird's stomach.<ref name = cornell/> Feathers are not only swallowed by adults, mainly during self-preening, but are often fed to the young, sometimes within a day of hatching. These feathers soon decompose into a felt-like, amorphous mass.<ref name= Johnsgard1> Johnsgard (1987)37&ndash;53</ref>  The function of the feathers in the stomach is unknown, although it has been suggested that they help to protect the lower digestive tract from bones and other hard, indigestible material.<ref name = cornell/>
