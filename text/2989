'''Nutbourne Windmill''' is a [[tower mill]] at [[Nutbourne, Horsham|Nutbourne]], [[Sussex]], [[England]] which has been converted to retail use.

==History==

''Nutbourne Windmill'' was built in 1854.<ref name=Hemming>{{cite web| url= http://theweald.org/bk.asp?bookid=wind089&xid=N&xnm=1| publisher =The Weald| title = Windmills in Sussex p89| accessdate= 2008-05-12}}</ref> It had a short working life, stopping c.1894. The mill gradually became derelict, although the cap was still on the mill during the Second World War. At some point, the tail beam failed, and the windshaft was left hanging down vertically at the top of the tower, supported  by the stocks alone.<ref name=Book>{{cite book | first =  Martin| last = Brunnarius| year = 1979| title = The Windmills of Sussex| pages = p80-81, 191| publisher = Philimore| location = Chichester| id= ISBN 0 85033 345 8}}</ref> The mill tower now serves as a tasting room and shop for Nutbourne [[vineyard]]s.<ref name=Vine>{{cite web| url= http://www.nutbournevineyards.com/vine.html| publisher =Nutbourne Vineyards| title = The Windmill Shop| accessdate= 2008-05-12}}</ref>
