'''Charles Hill, Baron Hill of Luton''' [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] (15 January 1904 &ndash; 22 August 1989) was a British [[Administrator of the Government|administrator]], [[medical doctor|doctor]] and [[television|television executive]].

Charles Hill was born in [[Islington]], [[London]] and was educated at [[St Olave's Grammar School]] in [[Southwark]], London. He won a scholarship to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he gained a first class degree. He continued his medical studies at the [[London Hospital]] gaining [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] and [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]] in 1927 and later he gained [[Bachelor of Medicine|MB]], BCh and [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]. He became Deputy Medical Officer of Oxford in 1930. He became Assistant Secretary of the [[British Medical Association]] from 1932 and Secretary from 1944 to 1950.

During the [[Second World War]], the Ministry of Health had wanted the [[BBC]] to infiltrate health messages into ordinary programmes rather than have dedicated programmes from the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]], but the BBC warned that this would not be effective and would be viewed by listeners as patronising. Consequently, Hill's role as the "Radio Doctor" became part of the Ministry of Food's programme, "Kitchen Front", every morning from 1942. Because of the then rules about members of the medical profession advertising he could not broadcast under his own name, and so was just 'The Radio Doctor'. His distinctive rich voice helped make and impact.

Hill was still the BMA's Secretary when the [[National Health Service]] was introduced in 1948. He negotiated with [[Aneurin Bevan]] and ensured that [[general practitioner]]s did not simply become salaried employees. He stood for [[British Parliament|Parliament]] for [[University of Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge]] in 1945 as an independent. He was successful in 1950, becoming [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Luton (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and National Liberal]].

He was appointed [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food]] in 1951. He became the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]] (a non-cabinet ministerial position with responsibilities that included broadcasting) in 1955; during his period in office he publicly berated the [[BBC]] for its reporting of the [[Suez Crisis]]. In May 1956, Hill attempted to formalise the existing agreement by which discussions or statements about matters before Parliament could not be broadcast in the fortnight preceding any debate (the 'fourteen day rule'). However, the Suez Crisis rendered this policy unworkable in practice and the government agreed to its suspension at the end of the year. Hill, who had been uneasy about the implications of the rule for freedom of expression, was relieved.

From 1957 to 1961 he was [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] and from 1961 he was to Minister of Housing and Local Government and Welsh Affairs, but he lost his place in the Cabinet in [[Harold Macmillan]]'s reshuffle in 1962.

He was appointed as the [[Chairman]] of the [[Independent Television Authority]] in 1963, where he continued his hostile attitude towards the BBC. He was then created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Hill of Luton''', of Harpenden in the County of Hertford. In 1967 Hill announced that the [[ITV]] contracts were all to be re-advertised, because he was concerned about the large profits being made by the major companies and their lack of regional identity. This resulted in a radical reorganisation of the ITV network.

He succeeded [[Norman Brook, 1st Baron Normanbrook|Lord Normanbrook]] as the Chairman of the BBC Governors (1967<U+2013>1972), having been appointed by the [[Prime Minister]], [[Harold Wilson]], to "sort out" the Corporation. His appointment as BBC Chairman surprised the BBC's Governors and several resigned. [[Robert Lusty|Sir Robert Lusty]], the acting Chairman, commented that "it was like inviting [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] to command the [[British Eighth Army|Eighth Army]] on the eve of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Alamein]]".

Harold Wilson encouraged Lord Hill to be active in editorial decisions. Hill had a difficult relationship with the [[Director-General of the BBC]], [[Hugh Greene]], and he eventually forced Greene to resign in 1969. Greene later described Hill as a "vulgarian". He had a quieter relationship with Greene's successor, [[Charles Curran (broadcaster)|Charles Curran]]. He retired from the BBC in 1972 and died in 1989, aged 85.

He married Marion Spencer Wallace, with whom he had two sons and three daughters.
