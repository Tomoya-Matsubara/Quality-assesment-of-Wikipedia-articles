Born in [[Melbourne]], Higgins was musical from an early age. While at boarding school, she wrote a song for a music assignment which was subsequently entered into a national radio competition for unsigned bands. Higgins won the competition and got recording contracts with Eleven and [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] After taking time off to go backpacking in Europe, she recorded her first album ''[[The Sound of White]]'', which was released in 2004. The album, and its first  single, "Scar" both went to #1 on the [[ARIA Charts]]. "The Special Two" went to #2. Higgins was nominated for five [[ARIA Music Awards]] that year and won the award for Best Pop Release for "Scar". In 2005 she was nominated for seven ARIA Awards and won five.

In 2006, she wrote new material for her second album, and following a US tour she recorded ''[[On a Clear Night]]''. It was released in April 2007, giving her another #1 single with "Steer" and the ARIA Award for Best Female Artist. Higgins has experienced significant success in Australia with several tours and performances in high-profile events [[Live Earth concert, Sydney|Live Earth]] and [[WaveAid]]. She has toured internationally and worked in the United States. Her song "Where I Stood" has been used in several television shows. Along with her music career, Higgins pursues interests in animal rights and the environment, endeavouring to make all of her tours [[carbon neutral]]. In 2009 she made her acting debut in Australian feature ''[[Bran Nue Dae (film)|Bran Nue Dae]].
