He started the piano at the age of five, was playing cornet in his school band, then violin for a couple of years at high school, and later was school pianist. in 1952, he began his Bachelor of Music degree at [[Melbourne University]] [[College or university school of music|Conservatorium of Music]] taking piano as chief study and oboe as second. He interrupted his studies and served some years as oboist for [[J. C. Williamson|J. C. Williamson theatres]], playing [[Musical theatre|musicals]], [[opera]], and several [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] Opera seasons, several ballet seasons ([[The Australian Ballet|Borovansky Ballet]]), Australian tours of the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Covent Garden Ballet]], and the [[New York City Ballet|American Ballet Company]], and as a [[copyist]] / arranger with [[GTV]] channel 9.

Back again in Tasmania, his next move was to [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]] (1965<U+2013>1974) to join NZBCSO (the [[New Zealand Symphony Orchestra|New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra]]) as Principal Cor anglais. During this time, in which he yo-yoed across Australasia, Harris tutored in oboe at the universities of Tasmania, Melbourne, and the [[Victoria University of Wellington]]. It was at the latter that he completed his degree in [[Musical composition|composition]] (with [[David Farquhar (composer)|David Farquhar]]) in 1969. He was to return yet again to Tasmania at the end of 1974. However, this time, he embraced a new career as a music educator with his move. He also conducted the Tasmanian Junior Youth Orchestra for several years.

Later he changed to oboe as his chief study and studied [[Musical composition|composition]] with Arthur Nickson. he was soon in demand as a free-lance orchestral musician, arranger and copyist, working in a very eclectic mix of musical spheres from arranging for [[Eartha Kitt]] (television and various theatrical shows), to playing in [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[chamber music]] and [[symphony orchestra]]s. He was a founding member of the Glendenian Trio, ([[flute]], [[oboe]], [[bassoon]]), which gave regular broadcasts over several years. The trio was another area in which his skills at arrangement were frequently employed.

Harris was a dedicated member of policy committees, especially in Education and the Arts and served as music critic for [[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]], Hobart's daily newspaper, for several years.

Ian Harris moved back to Sydney definitively in 2000 and has since devoted to composition.

Ian Keith Harris destroyed most of his early compositions on completion, "never satisfied in their worth".

His oeuvre consists mainly of chamber music, much of which has been performed and broadcast: ''Microsymphony'' for Cor anglais Quartet (cor anglais, [[string trio]]), ''Oboe Quartet'' (oboe, string trio), ''Essay'' for Bassoon and Strings, ''Sonata for [[Viola]] and [[Piano]]'', amongst many other pieces and numerous arrangements for broadcasts and concerts.

His sense of fun has shown in many of his compositions including, ''A Piece with Strawberry Jam'', ''The Little Dog's Day'' ([[Rupert Brooke]]), ''Paw de Trois'' (for [[Wind quintet|Wind Quintet]], with movements dedicated to his pets by name), ''The Whitebait Fishers'' <U+00AD> "A sort of [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]-like spoof for [[harpsichord]], [[string quartet]] and small choir, for which the producer of the hour-long national radio show penned the libretto for this, a special anniversary broadcast of the programme."<ref name="whitebait">composer's notes</ref>

Harris orchestrated songs for symphony concerts, including a version of ''[[The Last Rose of Summer]]'' for [[Rita Streich]] (1920<U+2013>1987). He also wrote, directed and even performed in advertising [[jingle|jingles]], playing [[celesta]], oboe, cor anglais or whatever was required.
