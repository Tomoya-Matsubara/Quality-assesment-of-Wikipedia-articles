== Institution ==
As one of the oldest universities in Indonesia, the University of Indonesia (UI) has pride in its reputation, established by its outstanding learning in 12 faculties (and one polytechnics which later separated to be Jakarta State Polytechnic/PNJ), one graduate school and qualified graduates who have been very influential in the country<U+2019>s history. Since its establishment in 1950, UI has continued to grow and flourish. Today UI remains a dynamic centre of excellence for research and learning, attracting more than 30,000 Indonesian and international students. Most international students come from countries such as Korea, Japan, China, ASEAN countries, Taiwan, Turkey, India, Canada, USA, and Australia. The students are taught by staff at the forefront of their disciplines.

As part of international community, UI has actively cooperated with other international universities and instititutions in the areas of teaching, research, consultations and exchange of students and staff. It also has a strong link with embassies and industry.

== History ==
After the proclamation of independence on the August 17th, 1945, the Indonesian government has realized that education is of utmost important for progress so that a few days afterwards The Republic of Indonesia Institute for Higher Education (BPTRI) was established in Jakarta consisting of the faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy, Letters and Law, which had its first graduation of 90 medical doctors the same year. When the Dutch colonial army occupied Jakarta at the end of 1945, the BPTRI moved to Klaten, Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Malang. Meanwhile, the Dutch colonial government, which by 1946 had occupied the big cities and surrounding areas in Indonesia, established a Nood Universiteit or "Emergency University" at Jakarta in 1946. In 1947 the name was changed into "Universitaet van Indonesie" (UVI) or "University of Indonesia" After the end of Indonesian war of independence, when Jakarta became once again the capital of Indonesia, the government established a state university in Jakarta in February 1950 called, Universitaet Indonesia, comprising of units of the BPTRI and UVI. The name Universitaet Indonesia was later changed into Universitas Indonesia (UI).

In 1950, UI was a multi campus university with faculties in Jakarta (Medicine, Law, and Letters), Bogor (Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine), Bandung (Engineering, Mathematics and Natural Sciences), Surabaya (Medicine and Dentistry), and Makassar (Economics). In 1954, the Surabaya campus became Universitas Airlangga; in 1955 the Ujung Pandang campus became Universitas Hasanuddin; in 1959 the Bandung campus became Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB or Bandung Institute of Technology), while the School for Physical Education, which was also located in Bandung, became part of Padjajaran University, in 1960. In 1964, the Bogor campus became Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) and the Faculty of Education (FKIP) at Jakarta, became IKIP Jakarta. In a sense UI was the mother of several universities. In 1965, UI consisted of three campuses all in Jakarta, i.e. the Salemba Campus (Medicine, Dentistry, Economics, Engineering, Science and the Graduate School), the Rawamangun Campus (Letters, Law, Social Science and Psychology) and the Pegangsaan Campus (Public Health and parts of Medicine).
