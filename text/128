'''Operation Storm''' ({{lang-sh|Operacija Oluja}}, {{Cyrl|''O<U+043F>e<U+0440>a<U+0446><U+0438>ja O<U+043B><U+0443>ja''|sh}}) was the last major battle of the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. It was a [[decisive victory]] for the [[Croatian Army]] (HV), which attacked across a {{convert|630|km|adj=on}} front against the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK). The HV was supported by the [[Croatian special police order of battle in 1991<U+2013>95|Croatian special police]] advancing from the [[Velebit]] Mountain, and the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) located in the [[Biha<U+0107> pocket]], in the [[Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina]] (ARSK) rear. The battle, launched to restore [[Croatia]]n control of {{convert|10400|km2|abbr=off}} of territory, representing 18.4% of the country, was the largest European land battle since the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Operation Storm commenced at dawn on 4 August 1995 and was declared complete on the evening of 7 August, despite significant mopping-up operations against pockets of resistance lasting until 14 August.

Operation Storm was also a [[strategic victory]] in the [[Bosnian War]] as the [[siege of Biha<U+0107>]] was lifted and the HV, [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) and the ARBiH were placed in a position to change the military balance of power in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] through the subsequent [[Operation Mistral 2]]. The operation built on HV and HVO advances gained during [[Operation Summer '95]] when strategic positions allowing the rapid capture of the RSK capital [[Knin]] were gained, and on the continued arming and training of the HV since the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, when the RSK was created during the Serb [[Log revolution|rebellion]] and [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) intervention. The operation itself followed an unsuccessful [[United Nations]] (UN) peacekeeping mission and diplomatic efforts to settle the conflict.

The HV's success was a result of a series of improvements to the HV itself, and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful at all points, but seizing key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability. The HV capture of [[Bosansko Grahovo]], just before Operation Storm and the special police's advance to [[Gra<U+010D>ac]], made it nearly impossible to defend Knin. In [[Lika]], two guard brigades quickly cut the ARSK-held area lacking tactical depth and mobile reserve forces, isolating pockets of resistance and positioning a mobile force for a decisive northward thrust into the [[Karlovac]] Corps [[area of responsibility]] (AOR) and pushing ARSK towards [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]]. The defeat of the ARSK at [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]] and [[Petrinja]], after a tough defence, defeated the ARSK Banija Corps as well, as its reserve was pinned down by the ARBiH. The RSK relied on the [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav]] militaries as its strategic reserve, but they did not intervene in the battle.

The HV and the special police suffered 174&ndash;211 killed or missing, while the ARSK had 560 soldiers killed. Four UN peacekeepers were also killed. The HV captured 4,000 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. The number of Serb civilian deaths is disputed&mdash;Croatia claims that 214 were killed, while Serbian sources cite 1,192 civilians killed or missing. During and after the offensive, 150,000<U+2013>200,000 Serbs<U+2014>or nearly the entire [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb population]] of the area formerly held by the ARSK<U+2014>fled and a variety of crimes were committed against the remaining civilians there. The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) later [[Trial of Gotovina et al|tried three Croatian generals]] charged with [[war crime]]s and partaking in a [[joint criminal enterprise]] designed to force the Serb population out of Croatia; they were all ultimately acquitted and the tribunal ruling refuted the charges that Operation Storm was planned as a criminal enterprise. {{As of|2012|November}}, the Croatian judiciary has convicted 2,380 persons for various crimes committed during Operation Storm.

==Background==
{{Main|Croatian War of Independence}}
In 1990, following the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|electoral defeat]] of the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], ethnic tensions between [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] worsened.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoare|2010|p=117}}</ref> Serbian [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] used [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]]'s actions to his advantage, portraying the Croatian leader and his [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) as a reincarnation of the [[Usta<U+0161>e]].<ref>{{harvnb|Glaurdi<U+0107>|2011|p=86}}</ref>

In August 1990, an insurgency known as the [[Log Revolution]] took place in Croatia centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the [[Dalmatia]]n hinterland around the city of [[Knin]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|19 August 1990}}</ref> as well as in parts of the [[Lika]], [[Kordun]], and [[Banovina (region)|Banovina]] regions, and settlements in [[eastern Croatia]] with significant Serb populations.<ref name=MarticICTY>{{harvnb|ICTY|12 June 2007}}</ref> The areas were subsequently named the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK) and, after declaring its intention to integrate with [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]], the [[Government of Croatia]] declared the RSK a rebellion.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 April 1991}}</ref> The conflict escalated by March 1991, resulting in the [[Croatian War of Independence]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 March 1991}}</ref> In June 1991, [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia declared its independence]] as [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia disintegrated]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|26 June 1991}}</ref> A three-month moratorium on Croatia's and the RSK's declarations followed,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|29 June 1991}}</ref> after which the decision came into effect on 8 October.<ref>{{harvnb|Narodne novine|8 October 1991}}</ref> The RSK then initiated a campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] against Croat civilians and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. By November 1993, less than 400 ethnic [[Croats]] remained in the [[United Nations]]-protected area known as Sector South,<ref>{{harvnb|Department of State|31 January 1994}}</ref> while a further 1,500 &ndash; 2,000 remained in Sector North.<ref name=UNCHR>{{harvnb|ECOSOC|17 November 1993|loc=Section J, points 147 & 150}}</ref>

As the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK and the [[Croatian Police]] was unable to cope with the situation, the [[Croatian National Guard]] (ZNG) was formed in May 1991. The ZNG was renamed the [[Croatian Army]] (HV) in November.<ref>{{harvnb|EECIS|1999|pp=272<U+2013>278}}</ref> The establishment of the [[military of Croatia]] was hampered by a UN [[arms embargo]] introduced in September.<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|10 October 1992}}</ref> The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the [[Battle of the Barracks]],<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|24 September 1991}}</ref> the [[Siege of Dubrovnik]],<ref>{{harvnb|Bjelajac|<U+017D>unec|2009|pp=249<U+2013>250}}</ref> and the [[Battle of Vukovar]].<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|18 November 1991}}</ref>

In January 1992, an agreement to implement the [[Vance plan]] designed to stop the fighting was made by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN.<ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire">{{harvnb|The New York Times|3 January 1992}}</ref> Ending the series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement.<ref>{{harvnb|Los Angeles Times|29 January 1992}}</ref> A stalemate developed as the conflict evolved into static trench warfare, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], where a new conflict was anticipated.<ref name="NYTimes-Jan3-Ceasefire"/> Serbia continued to support the RSK,<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2012|p=417}}</ref> but a series of HV advances restored small areas to Croatian control as the siege of [[Dubrovnik]] ended,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|15 July 1992}}</ref> and [[Operation Maslenica]] resulted in minor tactical gains.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|24 January 1993}}</ref> In response to the HV successes, the [[Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina]] (ARSK) intermittently attacked a number of Croat towns and villages with artillery and missiles.<ref name=MarticICTY/><ref>{{harvnb|ECOSOC|17 November 1993|loc=Section K, point 161}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|13 September 1993}}</ref>

As the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new [[Bosnian Serb]] army, as Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of a 29 February &ndash; 1 March 1992 referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The referendum was later cited as a pretext for the [[Bosnian War]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=382}}</ref> Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital, [[Sarajevo]], and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and [[Doboj]].

==Prelude==
In November 1994, the [[Siege of Biha<U+0107>]], a battle of the Bosnian War, entered a critical stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Biha<U+0107> from the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH). It was a strategic area and,<ref name="Halberstam 2003 284">{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|p=284}}</ref> since June 1993, [[Biha<U+0107>]] had been one of six [[United Nations Safe Areas]] established in Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|p=204}}</ref> The [[US administration]] felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point. Amongst the [[United States]], [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], division existed regarding how to protect the area.<ref name="Halberstam 2003 284"/><ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|27 November 1994}}</ref> The US called for [[airstrikes]] against the VRS, but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed as a part of the UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In turn, the US was unwilling to commit ground troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|pp=285<U+2013>286}}</ref> On the other hand, the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move,<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|p=305}}</ref> since [[French President]] [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Mitterrand]] discouraged any military intervention, greatly aiding the Serb war effort.<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|p=304}}</ref> The French stance reversed after [[Jacques Chirac]] was elected president of France in May 1995,<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|p=293}}</ref> pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Halberstam|2003|p=306}}</ref> Denying Biha<U+0107> to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia,<ref>{{harvnb|Hodge|2006|p=104}}</ref> and [[General]] [[Janko Bobetko]], the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia|Chief of the Croatian General Staff]], considered the potential fall of Biha<U+0107> to represent an end to Croatia's war effort.<ref name="JL-Winter">{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|9 December 2007}}</ref>

In March 1994, the [[Washington Agreement]] was signed,<ref name="JL-Winter"/> ending the Croat<U+2013>Bosniak War, and providing Croatia with US military advisors from [[Military Professional Resources Inc.|Military Professional Resources Incorporated]] (MPRI).<ref name=Dunigan>{{harvnb|Dunigan|2011|pp=93<U+2013>94}}</ref> The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by [[Bill Clinton]] in February 1993.<ref name="Woodward 2010 432">{{harvnb|Woodward|2010|p=432}}</ref> Because the UN arms embargo was still in place, MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV for participation in the [[NATO]] [[Partnership for Peace]] programme. MPRI trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources,<ref name=Dunigan/> including an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by Leslie Wayne and in various Serbian media reports,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|13 October 2002}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|RTS|3 September 2011}}</ref> that MPRI may also have provided [[Military doctrine|doctrinal]] advice, [[scenario planning]] and US government [[satellite intelligence]] to Croatia,<ref name=Dunigan/> although MPRI,<ref>{{harvnb|Avant|2005|p=104}}</ref> American and Croatian officials have denied such claims.<ref>{{harvnb|Jutarnji list|20 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|RFE|20 August 2010}}</ref> In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina,<ref>{{harvnb|Bono|2003|p=107}}</ref> in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=439}}</ref>

The Washington Agreement also resulted in a series of meetings between Croatian and US government and military officials in [[Zagreb]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] On 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from [[Livno]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to draw away part of the force besieging Biha<U+0107> and to prevent the town's capture by the Serbs. As the US officials gave no response to the proposal, the Croatian General Staff ordered [[Operation Winter '94]] the same day, to be carried out by the HV and the [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO)&mdash;the main military force of the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croats]]. In addition to contributing to the defence of Biha<U+0107>, the attack shifted the HV's and HVO's line of contact closer to the RSK's supply routes.<ref name="JL-Winter"/>

In 1994, the United States, [[Russia]], the [[European Union]] (EU) and the UN sought to replace the Vance plan, which brought in the UNPROFOR. They formulated the [[Z-4 plan|Z-4 Plan]] giving Serb-majority areas in Croatia substantial autonomy.<ref name=Armatta>{{harvnb|Armatta|2010|pp=201<U+2013>204}}</ref> After numerous and frequently uncoordinated changes to the proposed plan, including leaking of its draft elements to the press in October, the Z-4 Plan was presented on 30 January 1995. Neither Croatia nor the RSK liked the plan. Croatia was concerned that the RSK might accept it, but Tu<U+0111>man realised that Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>, who would ultimately make the decision for the RSK,<ref>{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|pp=160<U+2013>166}}</ref> would not accept the plan for fear that it would set a precedent for a political settlement in [[Kosovo]]&mdash;allowing Croatia to accept the plan with little possibility for it to be implemented.<ref name=Armatta/> The RSK refused to receive, let alone accept, the plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Galbraith|2006|p=126}}</ref>

In December 1994, Croatia and the RSK made an economic agreement to restore road and rail links, water and gas supplies, and use of a part of the [[Adria oil pipeline]]. Even though some of the agreement was never implemented,<ref>{{harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|2006|p=205}}</ref> a section of the [[A3 (Croatia)|Zagreb&ndash;Belgrade motorway]] passing through RSK territory near [[Oku<U+010D>ani]] and the pipeline were both opened. Following a deadly incident that occurred in late April 1995 on the recently opened motorway,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|2 May 1995}}</ref> Croatia reclaimed all of the RSK's territory in western [[Slavonia]] during [[Operation Flash]],<ref name=Goldstein252>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1999|pp=252<U+2013>253}}</ref> taking full control of the territory by 4 May, three days after the battle began. In response, the ARSK attacked Zagreb using [[M-87 Orkan]] missiles with [[cluster munition]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=456}}</ref> Subsequently, Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> sent a senior [[Yugoslav Army (FRY)|Yugoslav Army]] officer to command the ARSK, along with arms, field officers and thousands of Serbs born in the RSK area who had been forcibly conscripted by the ARSK.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|15 July 1995}}</ref>

On 17 July, the ARSK and the VRS started a fresh effort to capture Biha<U+0107> by expanding on gains made during [[Operation Spider]]. The move provided the HV with a chance to extend their territorial gains from Operation Winter '94 by advancing from the Livno valley. On 22 July, Tu<U+0111>man and Bosnian President [[Alija Izetbegovi<U+0107>]] signed the [[Split Agreement]] for [[Mutual Defense Treaty|mutual defence]], permitting the large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The HV and HVO responded quickly through [[Operation Summer '95]] ({{lang-hr|Ljeto '95}}), capturing [[Bosansko Grahovo]] and [[Glamo<U+010D>]] on 28&ndash;29 July.<ref name=Ingrao>{{harvnb|Bjelajac|<U+017D>unec|2009|p=254}}</ref> The attack drew some ARSK units away from Biha<U+0107>,<ref name=Ingrao/><ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|31 July 1995}}</ref> but not as many as expected. However, it put the HV in an excellent position,<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=364<U+2013>366}}</ref> as it isolated Knin from the Republika Srpska, as well as [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{harvnb|Burg|Shoup|2000|p=348}}</ref>

In late July and early August, there were two more attempts at resurrecting the Z-4 Plan and the 1994 economic agreement. Talks proposed on 28 July were ignored by the RSK, and last-ditch talks were held in [[Geneva]] on 3 August. These quickly broke down as Croatia and the RSK rejected a compromise proposed by [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]], a Special Representative of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]], essentially calling for further negotiations at a later date. In addition, the RSK dismissed a set of Croatian demands, including to disarm, and failed to endorse the Z-4 Plan once again. The talks were used by Croatia to prepare diplomatic ground for the imminent Operation Storm,<ref>{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|pp=171<U+2013>173}}</ref> whose planning was completed during the [[Brijuni]] Islands meeting between Tu<U+0111>man and military commanders on 31 July.<ref name=Pukanic>{{harvnb|Nacional|3 April 2005}}</ref> The HV started large-scale [[mobilization]] in late July, soon after General [[Zvonimir <U+010C>ervenko]] became its new Chief of General Staff on 15 July.<ref name=BB367>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=367}}</ref>

The 25,000-strong HV Gospi<U+0107> Corps was assigned the Storm-3 component of the operation,<ref name=BB369>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=369}}</ref> to the left of the special police zone. It was commanded by [[Brigadier]] [[Mirko Norac]], and opposed by the ARSK 15th Lika Corps, headquartered in [[Korenica]] and commanded by Major General [[Stevan <U+0160>evo]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=81<U+2013>82}}</ref> The Lika Corps, consisting of about 6,000 troops, was sandwiched between the HV Gospi<U+0107> Corps and the ARBiH in the [[Biha<U+0107> pocket]] in ARSK rear, forming a wide but a very shallow area. The [[V Corps (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|ARBiH 5th Corps]] deployed about 2,000 troops in the zone. The Gospi<U+0107> Corps, assigned a {{convert|150|km|adj=on}} section of the front, was tasked with cutting the RSK in half and linking up with the ARBiH, while the ARBiH was tasked with pinning down ARSK forces that were in contact with the Biha<U+0107> pocket.<ref name=BB369/>

The HV Karlovac Corps, commanded by Major General [[Miljenko Crnjac]], on the left flank of the Gospi<U+0107> Corps, covered the area extending from [[Ogulin]] to Karlovac, including Kordun,<ref name=Marijan9092>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=90<U+2013>92}}</ref> and executed the Storm-2 plan. The corps was composed of 15,000 troops and was tasked with pinning down the ARSK forces in the area to protect the flanks of the Zagreb and Gospi<U+0107> Corps.<ref name=BB368369>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=368<U+2013>369}}</ref> It had a forward command post in Ogulin and was opposed by the ARSK 21st Kordun Corps headquartered at [[Petrova Gora]],<ref name=Marijan9092/> consisting of 4,000 troops in the AOR (one of its brigades was facing the Zagreb Corps).<ref name=BB368369/> Initially, the 21st Kordun Corps was commanded by Colonel Veljko Bosanac, but he was replaced by Colonel <U+010C>edo Bulat during the evening of 5 August. In addition, the bulk of the ARSK Special Units Corps was present in the area, commanded by Major General [[Milorad Stupar]].<ref name=Marijan9092/> ARSK Special Units Corps was 5,000-strong, largely facing the Biha<U+0107> pocket at the onset of Operation Storm. The ARSK armour and artillery in the AOR outnumbered that of the HV.<ref name=BB368369/>

The HV Zagreb Corps, assigned the Storm-1 plan, initially commanded by Major General [[Ivan Basarac]], on the left flank of the Karlovac Corps, was deployed on three main axes of attack&mdash;towards [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]], [[Petrinja]] and [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]]. It was opposed by the ARSK 39th Banija Corps, headquartered in Glina and commanded by Major General [[Slobodan Tarbuk]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=100<U+2013>101}}</ref> The Zagreb Corps was tasked with bypassing Petrinja to neutralize ARSK artillery and missiles potentially targeting Croatian cities, making a secondary thrust from [[Sunja, Sisak-Moslavina County|Sunja]] towards Hrvatska Kostajnica. Their secondary mission was compromised when a battalion of the special police and the 81st Guards Battalion planned to spearhead the advance were deployed elsewhere forcing modifications to the plan. The Zagreb Corps was composed of 30,000 troops, while the ARSK had 9,000 facing them and about 1,000 ARBiH troops in the Biha<U+0107> pocket to their rear. At the start of Operation Storm, about 3,500 ARSK troops were in contact with the ARBiH.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=368}}</ref> HV Bjelovar Corps, on the left flank of the Zagreb Corps, covering the area along the [[Una (Sava)|Una River]], had a forward command post in [[Novska]]. The corps was commanded by Major General [[Luka D<U+017E>anko]]. Opposite the Bjelovar Corps was a part of the ARSK Banija Corps. The Bjelovar Corps was included in the attack on 2 August and were therefore not issued a separate operations plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=115}}</ref>

The ARSK divided its forces in the area in two, subordinating the North Dalmatia and Lika Corps to the ARSK General Staff, and grouping the rest into the Kordun Operational Group commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel General]] [[Mile Novakovi<U+0107>]]. Territorially, the division corresponded to the North and South sectors of the UN protected areas.<ref name=BB367368>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=367<U+2013>368}}</ref>

Estimates of the total number of troops deployed by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian forces have been estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000,<ref name=Goldstein252/><ref>{{harvnb|Henriksen|2007|p=104}}</ref> but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops.<ref name=Thomas55>{{harvnb|Thomas|2006|p=55}}</ref><ref name=Index130>{{harvnb|Index.hr|5 August 2011}}</ref> ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=37<U+2013>38}}</ref> More detailed HV estimates of the manpower by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers,<ref name=Marijan67116/> while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Sekuli<U+0107>|2000|p=262}}</ref> The discrepancy is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops.<ref name=Thomas55/> The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Biha<U+0107>.<ref name=BB368369/> In late 1994, the [[Fikret Abdi<U+0107>]]-led [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia]] (APWB)&mdash;a sliver of land northwest of Biha<U+0107> between its ally RSK and the pocket&mdash;commanded 4,000&ndash;5,000 soldiers who were deployed south of [[Velika Kladu<U+0161>a]] against the ARBiH force.<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|2006|p=451}}</ref>

==Operation timeline==

===4 August 1995===
Operation Storm started at 5&nbsp;a.m. on 4 August 1995 when coordinated attacks were executed by reconnaissance and sabotage detachments in concert with [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Croatian Air Force]] (CAF) air strikes aimed at disrupting ARSK [[command, control, and communications]].<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=370}}</ref> UN peacekeepers, known as [[United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation]] (UNCRO),<ref>{{harvnb|UNCRO}}</ref> were notified three hours in advance of the attack when Tu<U+0111>man's chief of staff, [[Hrvoje <U+0160>arini<U+0107>]], telephoned UNCRO commander, [[French Army]] General Bernard Janvier. In addition, each HV corps notified the UNCRO sector in its path of the attack, requesting written confirmations of receipt of the information. The UNCRO relayed the information to the RSK,<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=129}}</ref> confirming the warnings RSK received from the Yugoslav Army General Staff the previous day.<ref>{{harvnb|Sekuli<U+0107>|2000|p=173}}</ref>

====Sector South====
[[File:Martic-order1995.jpg|thumb|250px|right|upright|Order of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina|RSK]] Supreme Defence Council to evacuate civilians from the [[Knin]] area|alt=Typewritten and signed order]]
In the Split Corps AOR, at 5&nbsp;a.m. the 7th Guards Brigade advanced south from Bosansko Grahovo towards the high ground ahead of Knin after a period of artillery preparation. Moving against the ARSK 3rd [[Battlegroup (army)|Battlegroup]], consisting of elements of the North Dalmatian Corps and RSK police, the 7th Guards achieved its objectives for the day and allowed the 4th Guards Brigade to attack. The HV [[Sinj]] Operational Group (OG), on the left flank of the two brigades, joined the attack and the 126th Home Guard Regiment captured [[Uni<U+0161>ta (Bosansko Grahovo)|Uni<U+0161>ta]], gaining control of the area overlooking the Sinj&ndash;Knin road. The 144th Brigade and the 6th Home Guard Regiment also pushed ARSK forces back. The [[<U+0160>ibenik]] OG units faced the ARSK 75th Motorized Brigade and a part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the ARSK North Dalmatian Corps. There, the 142nd and the 15th Home Guard Regiments made minor progress in the area between [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] and [[Drni<U+0161>]], while the 113th Infantry Brigade made a slightly greater advance on their left flank, to [[<U+010C>ista Velika]]. In the [[Zadar]] OG area, the 134th Home Guard Regiment (without its 2nd Battalion) failed to advance, while the 7th Home Guard Regiment and the 112th HV Brigade gained little ground against the ARSK 92nd Motorized and 3rd Infantry Brigades at [[Benkovac]]. On the Velebit, the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Guards Brigade, reinforced with a company from the 7th Home Guard Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion of the 134th Home Guard Regiment met stiff resistance but advanced sufficiently to secure use of the [[Obrovac, Croatia|Obrovac]]&ndash;[[Sveti Rok]] road. At 4:45&nbsp;p.m., a decision to evacuate the population in the Northern Dalmatia and Lika areas was made by RSK President [[Milan Marti<U+0107>]].<ref name=Marijan7072>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=70<U+2013>72}}</ref><ref name=1996HRW9>{{harvnb|HRW|1996|p=9}}</ref> According to RSK Major General [[Milisav Sekuli<U+0107>]], Marti<U+0107> ordered the evacuation hoping to coax Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> and the international community to help the RSK.<ref>{{harvnb|Sekuli<U+0107>|2000|p=265}}</ref> Nonetheless, the evacuation was extended the whole sectors North and South, except Kordun region.<ref>{{harvnb|Sekuli<U+0107>|2000|p=267}}</ref> In the evening the ARSK General Staff moved from Knin to [[Srb]],<ref name=Marijan7072/> about {{convert|35|km|abbr=off}} to the northwest.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=371}}</ref>

At 5&nbsp;a.m., Croatian special police advanced to the Mali Alan pass on the Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps' 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade. The pass was captured at 1&nbsp;p.m., and Sveti Rok village was captured at about 5&nbsp;p.m. The special police advanced further beyond Mali Alan, meeting more resistance at 9&nbsp;p.m. and then [[Bivouac shelter|bivouacking]] until 5&nbsp;a.m. The ARSK 9th Motorized Brigade withdrew to [[Udbina]] after being forced out of its positions on the Velebit. In the morning, the special police captured [[Lovinac]], [[Gra<U+010D>ac]] and [[Medak, Croatia|Medak]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=76<U+2013>77}}</ref>

In the Gospi<U+0107> Corps AOR, the 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade began an eastward attack in the [[Mala Kapela]] area in the morning, meeting heavy resistance from the ARSK 70th Infantry Brigade. The rest of the 1st Guards joined in around midnight. The 133rd Home Guard Regiment attacked east of [[Oto<U+010D>ac]], towards [[Vrhovine]], attempting to encircle the ARSK 50th Infantry Brigade and elements of the ARSK 103rd Infantry Brigade in a [[pincer movement]]. Even though the regiment advanced, it failed to achieve its objective for the day. On the regiment's right flank, the HV 128th Brigade advanced together with the 3rd Battalion of the 8th Home Guard Regiment and cut through the Vrhovine&ndash;Korenica road. The rest of the 9th Guards Brigade, the bulk of the HV 118th Home Guard Regiment and the 111th Infantry Brigade advanced east from Gospi<U+0107> and Li<U+010D>ki Osik, coming up against very strong resistance from the ARSK 18th Infantry Brigade. As a result of these setbacks, the Gospi<U+0107> Corps ended the day short of the objectives it had been given.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=82<U+2013>84}}</ref>

====Sector North====
In the Ogulin area of the HV Karlovac Corps AOR, the 99th Brigade, reinforced by the 143rd Home Guard Regiment's [[Saborsko]] Company, moved towards [[Pla<U+0161>ki]] at 5&nbsp;a.m., but the force was stopped and turned back in disarray by 6&nbsp;p.m. The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced from [[Josipdol]] towards Pla<U+0161>ki, encountering minefields and strong ARSK resistance. Its elements connected with the 14th Home Guard Regiment, advancing through [[Barilovi<U+0107>]] towards [[Slunj]]. Near the city of Karlovac, the 137th Home Guard Regiment deployed four [[Reconnaissance|reconnaissance groups]] around midnight of 3&ndash;4 August, followed by artillery preparation and crossing of the [[Korana]] River at 5&nbsp;a.m. The advance was fiercely resisted by the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade, but the [[bridgehead]] was stable by the end of the day. The 110th Home Guard Regiment, reinforced by a company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment, advanced east to the road leading south from Karlovac to [[Vojni<U+0107>]] and Slunj, where it met heavy resistance and suffered more casualties to landmines, demoralizing the unit and preventing its further advance. In addition, the attached company of the 137th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade failed to secure the regiment's flanks. The 104th Brigade tried to cross the [[Kupa]] River at 5&nbsp;a.m., but failed and fell back to its starting position by 8&nbsp;a.m., at which time it was shifted to the bridgehead established by the 110th Home Guard Regiment. A company of the 99th Brigade was attached to the 143rd Home Guard Regiment for operations the next day, and a 250-strong battlegroup was removed from the brigade and subordinated to the Karlovac Corps directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=92<U+2013>93}}</ref>

In the Zagreb Corps area, the HV moved across the Kupa River at two points towards Glina&mdash;in and near [[Pokupsko]], using the 20th Home Guard Regiment and the 153rd Brigade. Both crossings established bridgeheads, although the bulk of the units were forced to retreat as the ARSK counter-attacked&mdash;only a battalion of the 153rd Brigade and elements of the 20th Home Guard Regiment held their ground. The crossings prompted the ARSK General Staff to order the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the Special Units Corps to move from Slunj to the bridgeheads,<ref name=Marijan101103>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=101<U+2013>103}}</ref> as the HV advance threatened a vital road in Glina.<ref name=BB368369/> The HV 2nd Guards Brigade and the 12th Home Guard Regiment were tasked with the quick capture of Petrinja from the ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade in a pincer movement.<ref name=Marijan101103/> The original plan, involving thrusts {{convert|6|to|7|km|abbr=off}} south of Petrinja, was amended by Basarac to a direct assault on the city.<ref name=BB369370/> On the right flank, the regiment was soon stopped by minefields and forced to retreat, while the bulk of the 2nd Guards Brigade advanced until it wavered following the loss of a company commander and five soldiers. The rest of the 2nd Guards Brigade&mdash;reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, elements of the 12th Home Guard Regiment, the 5th Antitank Artillery Battalion and the 31st Engineers Battalion&mdash;formed Tactical Group&nbsp;2 (TG2) operating on the left flank of the attack. TG2 advanced from [[Mo<U+0161><U+0107>enica]], a short distance from Petrinja, but was stopped after the 2nd Battalion's commander and six soldiers were killed. The ARSK 31st Motorized Brigade also panicked but managed to stabilize its defences as it received reinforcements. The HV 57th Brigade advanced south of Petrinja, intent on reaching the Petrinja&ndash;Hrvatska Kostajnica road, but ran into a minefield where the brigade commander was killed, while the 101st Brigade to its rear suffered heavy artillery fire and casualties. In the Sunja area, the 17th Home Guard Regiment and a company of the 151st Brigade unsuccessfully attacked the ARSK 26th Infantry Brigade. Later that day, a separate attack by the rest of the 151st Brigade also failed. The HV 103rd Brigade advanced to the Sunja&ndash;[[Sisak]] railroad, but had to retreat under heavy fire. The Zagreb Corps failed to meet any objective of the first day. This was attributed to inadequate manpower and as a result the corps requested the mobilization of the 102nd Brigade and the 1st and 21st Home Guard Regiments. The 2nd Guards Brigade was reinforced by the 1st Battalion of the 149th Brigade previously held in reserve in [[Ivani<U+0107> Grad]].<ref name=Marijan101103/>

In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, two battalions of the 125th Home Guard Regiment crossed the [[Sava]] River near [[Jasenovac, Sisak-Moslavina County|Jasenovac]], secured a bridgehead for trailing HV units and advanced towards [[Hrvatska Dubica]]. The two battalions were followed by an additional company of the same regiment, a battalion of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment, the 265th Reconnaissance Company and finally the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup. A reconnaissance platoon of the 52nd Home Guard Regiment crossed the Sava River into the Republika Srpska, established a bridgehead for two infantry companies and subsequently demolished the [[Dubica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Dubica]]&ndash;[[Gradi<U+0161>ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi<U+0161>ka]] road before returning to Croatian soil. The Bjelovar Corps units reached the outskirts of Hrvatska Dubica before nightfall. That night, the town of Hrvatska Dubica was abandoned by the ARSK troops and the civilian population. They fled south across the Sava River into Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=116<U+2013>117}}</ref>

The HV did not advance towards Knin during the night of 4/5 August when the ARSK General Staff ordered a battalion of the 75th Motorized Brigade to stage themselves north of Knin. The ARSK North Dalmatian Corps became increasingly uncoordinated as the HV 4th Guards Brigade advanced south towards Knin, protecting the right flank of the 7th Guards Brigade. The latter met little resistance and entered the town at about 11&nbsp;a.m. Lieutenant General [[Ivan <U+010C>ermak]] was appointed commander of the newly established HV Knin Corps. Sinj OG completed its objectives, capturing [[Veliki Kozjak|Kozjak]] and [[Vrlika]], and meeting little resistance as the ARSK 1st Light Brigade disintegrated, retreating to Knin and later to Lika. By 8&nbsp;p.m., <U+0160>ibenik OG units advanced to [[Poli<U+010D>nik]] (113th Brigade), [[<U+0110>evrske]] (15th Home Guard Regiment), and captured Drni<U+0161> (142nd Home Guard Regiment), while the ARSK 75th Motorized Brigade retreated towards Srb and [[Bosanski Petrovac]] together with the 3rd Infantry and the 92nd Motorized Brigades, leaving the Zadar OG units with little opposition. The 7th Home Guard Regiment captured Benkovac, while the 112th Brigade entered [[Smil<U+010D>i<U+0107>]] and elements of the 9th Guards Brigade reached Obrovac.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=72<U+2013>73}}</ref>

The 138th Home Guard Regiment and the 1st Guards Brigade advanced to Li<U+010D>ka Jasenica, the latter pressing their attack further towards Saborsko, with the 2nd Battalion of the HV 119th Brigade reaching the area in the evening. The HV reinforced the 133rd Home Guard Regiment with a battalion of the 150th Brigade enabling the regiment to achieve its objectives of the previous day, partially encircling the ARSK force in Vrhovine. The 154th Home Guard Regiment was mobilized and deployed to the [[Li<U+010D>ko Le<U+0161><U+0107>e]] area. The 9th Guards Brigade (without its 2nd Battalion) advanced towards Udbina Air Base, where ARSK forces started to evacuate. The 111th Brigade and the 118th Home Guard Regiment also made small advances, linking up behind ARSK lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=84<U+2013>85}}</ref>

====Sector North====
The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced towards Pla<U+0161>ki, capturing it that evening, while the 14th Home Guard Regiment captured Primi<U+0161>lje, {{convert|12|km|abbr=off}} northwest of Slunj. At 0:30&nbsp;a.m., the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and a company of the 19th Infantry Brigade counter-attacked at the Korana bridgehead, causing the bulk of the 137th Home Guard Regiment to panic and flee across the river. A single platoon of the regiment remained but the ARSK troops did not exploit the opportunity to destroy the bridgehead. In the morning, the regiment reoccupied the bridgehead, reinforced by a 350-strong battlegroup drawn from the 104th Brigade (including a tank platoon and [[multiple rocket launcher]]s), and a company of the 148th Brigade from the Karlovac Corps operational reserve. The regiment and the battlegroup managed to extend the bridgehead towards the Karlovac&ndash;Slunj road. The 110th Home Guard Regiment attacked again south of Karlovac, but was repelled by prepared ARSK defences. That night, the Karlovac Corps decided to move elements of the 110th Home Guard Regiment and the 104th Brigade to the Korana bridgehead, while the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade retreated to the right bank of Korana in an area extending about {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} north from Slunj.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=93<U+2013>95}}</ref>

The Zagreb Corps made little or no progress on day two of the battle. Part of the 2nd Guards Brigade was ordered to drive towards Glina with the 20th Home Guards Regiment making a modest advance, while the 153rd Brigade abandoned its bridgehead. In the area of Petrinja, the HV advanced gradually only to be pushed back in some areas by an ARSK counter-attack. The results were reversed at significant cost by a renewed push by the 2nd Guards Brigade. The Zagreb Corps commander was replaced by Lieutenant General [[Petar Stipeti<U+0107>]] on orders from President Tu<U+0111>man. The HV reassigned the 102nd Brigade to drive to Glina, and the 57th Brigade was reinforced with the 2nd Battalion of the 149th Brigade. The 145th Brigade was moved from [[Popova<U+010D>a]] to the Sunja area, where the 17th Home Guard Regiment and the 151st Brigade made minor advances into the ARSK-held area.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=103<U+2013>105}}</ref>

In the Bjelovar Corps AOR, Hrvatska Dubica was captured by the 52nd and the 24th Home Guard Regiments advancing from the east and the 125th Home Guard Regiment approaching from the north. The 125th Home Guard Regiment garrisoned the town, while the 52nd Home Guard Regiment moved northwest towards expected Zagreb Corps positions, but the Zagreb Corps' delays prevented any link-up. The 24th Home Guard Regiment advanced about {{convert|4|km|abbr=off}} towards Hrvatska Kostajnica when it was stopped by ARSK troops. In response, the Corps called in a battalion and a reconnaissance platoon of the 121st Home Guard Regiment from [[Nova Gradi<U+0161>ka]] to aid the push to the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=117}}</ref> The ARBiH [[505th Brigade|505th]] and 511th Mountain Brigades advanced north to Dvor and engaged the ARSK 33rd Infantry Brigade&mdash;the only reserve unit of the Banija Corps.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=372<U+2013>373}}</ref>

On 6 August, the HV conducted mopping-up operations in the areas around Obrovac, Benkovac, Drni<U+0161> and Vrlika, as President Tu<U+0111>man visited Knin.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=73}}</ref> After securing their objectives on or near Velebit, the special police was deployed on foot behind ARSK lines to hinder movement of ARSK troops there, capturing strategic intersections in the villages of Bruvno at 7&nbsp;a.m. and [[Otri<U+0107>]] at 11&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=77<U+2013>78}}</ref>

At midnight, elements of the ARBiH 501st and 502nd Mountain Brigades advanced west from Biha<U+0107> against a skeleton force of the ARSK Lika Corps that had been left behind since the beginning of the battle. The 501st moved about {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} into Croatian territory, to [[Li<U+010D>ko Petrovo Selo]] and [[Plitvice Lakes]] by 8&nbsp;a.m. The 502nd captured an ARSK radar and communications facility on [[Plje<U+0161>ivica]] Mountain, and proceeded towards Korenica where it was stopped by the ARSK units. The HV 1st Guards Brigade reached [[Rakovica, Croatia|Rakovica]] and linked up with the Bosnia-Herzegovina 5th Corps in the area of [[Dre<U+017E>nik Grad]] by 11&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=BB372>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=372}}</ref> It was supported by the 119th Brigade and a battalion of the 154th Home Guard Regiment deployed in the [[Tr<U+017E>a<U+010D>ka Ra<U+0161>tela]] and Li<U+010D>ko Petrovo Selo areas.<ref name=Marijan8687>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=86<U+2013>87}}</ref> In the afternoon, a link-up ceremony was held for the media in Tr<U+017E>a<U+010D>ka Ra<U+0161>tela.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=96}}</ref> The 138th Home Guard Regiment completely encircled Vrhovine, which was captured by the end of the day by the 8th and the 133rd Home Guard Regiments, reinforced with a battalion of the 150th Brigade. The HV 128th Brigade entered Korenica while the 9th Guards Brigade continued towards Udbina.<ref name=Marijan8687/>

The 143rd Home Guard Regiment advanced to [[Bro<U+0107>anac]] where it connected with the 1st Guards Brigade. From there the regiment continued towards Slunj, accompanied by elements of the 1st Guards Brigade and the 14th Home Guard Regiment, capturing the town at 3&nbsp;p.m. The advance of the 14th Home Guard Regiment was supported by the 148th Brigade guarding its flanks. The ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade retreated from Slunj, together with the civilian population, moving north towards [[Topusko]]. An attack by the 137th Home Guard Regiment, and the elements of various units reinforcing it, extended the bridgehead and connected it with the 14th Home Guard Regiment in Veljun, {{convert|18|km|abbr=off}} north of Slunj. The rest of the 149th Brigade (without the 1st Battalion) was reassigned from the Zagreb Corps to the Karlovac Corps to reinforce the 137th Home Guard Regiment.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=95<U+2013>96}}</ref> At 11&nbsp;a.m., an agreement was reached between the ARSK and civilian authorities in Glina and [[Vrginmost]], securing the evacuation of civilians from the area.<ref>{{harvnb|HRW|1996|p=17}}</ref> The ARBiH 502nd Mountain Brigade also moved north, flanking the APWB capital of Velika Kladu<U+0161>a from the west, and capturing the town by the end of the day.<ref name=BB373374>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=373<U+2013>374}}</ref>

The TG2 advanced to Petrinja at about 7&nbsp;a.m. after a heavy artillery preparation. The 12th Home Guard Regiment entered the city from the west and was subsequently assigned to garrison Petrinja and its surrounding area. After the loss of Petrinja to the HV, the bulk of the ARSK Banija Corps started to retreat towards [[Dvor, Croatia|Dvor]]. The HV 57th Brigade advanced against light resistance and took control of the Petrinja&ndash;Hrvatska Kostajnica road. During the night of 6/7 August, the 20th Home Guard Regiment, supported by Croatian police and elements of the 153rd Brigade, captured Glina despite strong resistance. The 153rd Brigade then took positions that allowed the advance to continue towards the village of [[Maja, Croatia|Maja]] in coordination with the 2nd Guards Brigade, which drove south from Petrinja towards [[Zrinska gora]] conducting mop-up operations. The 140th Home Guard Regiment flanked the 2nd Guards Brigade on the northern slope of Zrinska Gora, while the 57th Brigade captured [[Umeti<U+0107>]]. The 103rd and the 151st Brigades, and the 17th Home Guard Regiment, advanced towards Hrvatska Kostajnica, with the addition of a battalion of the HV 145th Brigade which would arrive that afternoon. Around noon, the 151st Brigade connected with the Bjelovar Corps units on the Sunja&ndash;Hrvatska Dubica road. They were assigned to secure roads in the area afterwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=105<U+2013>106}}</ref>

By capturing Glina, the HV trapped the bulk of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojni<U+0107>, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps was instructed to prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s with [[side arm]]s to Dvor and allow them to cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina. Based on information obtained from UN troops, it was believed that the ARSK forces in Banovina were about to surrender.<ref name=Marijan111>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=111}}</ref>

A battalion of the 121st Home Guard Regiment entered Hrvatska Kostajnica, while the 24th Home Guard Regiment battlegroup secured the national border behind them. The 52nd Home Guard Regiment connected with the Zagreb Corps and then turned south to the town, reaching it that evening. The capture of Hrvatska Kostajnica marked the fulfilment of all of the Bjelovar Corps' objectives.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=117<U+2013>118}}</ref>

===7 August 1995===
The [[1st Croatian Guards Brigade]] (''1. hrvatski gardijski zdrug'' - HGZ) arrived in the Knin area to connect with elements of the 4th, 7th and 9th Guards Brigades, tasked with a northward advance the next day. The Split Corps command moved to Knin as well.<ref name=Marijan74>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=74}}</ref> The Croatian special police proceeded to Gornji Lapac and [[Donji Lapac]] arriving by 2&nbsp;p.m. and completing the boundary between the Gospi<U+0107> and Split Corps AORs. The Croatian special police also made contact with the 4th Guards Brigade in Otri<U+0107> and the Gospi<U+0107> Corps units in Udbina by 3&nbsp;p.m. By 7&nbsp;p.m., a battalion of the special police reached the border near [[Kulen Vakuf]], securing the area.<ref name=Marijan78>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=78}}</ref>

In the morning, the 9th Guards Brigade (without its 2nd Battalion) captured Udbina, where it connected with the 154th Home Guard Regiment, approaching from the opposite side of the [[Krbava|Krbava Polje]]<!-- [[Krbava|Krbava {{lang|hr|Polje}}]] --> ({{lang-hr|[[Polje]]}} or [[karst|karst field]]). By the end of the day, Operation Storm objectives assigned to the Gospi<U+0107> Corps were completed.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=87<U+2013>88}}</ref>

A forward command post of the HV General Staff was moved from Ogulin to Slunj, and it assumed direct command of the 1st Guards Brigade, the 14th Home Guard Regiment and the 99th Brigade. The 14th Home Guard Regiment secured the Slunj area and deployed to the left bank of Korana to connect with the advancing Karlovac special police. Elements of the regiment and the 99th Brigade secured the national border in the area. The 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards Kordun, as the Karlovac Corps reoriented its main axis of attack. The 110th Home Guard Regiment and elements of the 104th Brigade reached a largely deserted Vojni<U+0107> in early afternoon, followed by the 1st Guards Brigade, the 143rd Home Guard Brigade and the 137th Home Guard Regiment. Other HV units joined them by evening.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=96<U+2013>97}}</ref>

The 2nd Guards Brigade advanced from Maja towards Dvor, but was stopped approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} short by ARSK units protecting the withdrawal of the ARSK and civilians towards the town. Elements of the brigade performed mopping-up operations in the area. The ARSK 33rd Infantry Brigade held the road bridge in Dvor that connected the ARSK and the Republika Srpska across the Una River. The brigade was overwhelmed by the ARBiH 5th Corps, and it retreated south of Una, as the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and the civilians from Kordun were reaching Dvor. Elements of the 17th Home Guard Regiment and the HV 145th and 151st Brigades reached Dvor via Hrvatska Kostajnica and came into contact with the ARSK 13th Infantry Brigade and elements of the ARSK 24th Infantry and 2nd Armoured Brigades, who had retreated from Glina.<ref name=BB373374/><ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=106<U+2013>107}}</ref> As the expected surrender of the ARSK Kordun Corps did not materialize, the HV was ordered to reengage.<ref name=Marijan111/> Despite major pockets of resistance, Croatia's defence minister, [[Gojko <U+0160>u<U+0161>ak]], declared major operations over at 6&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=BB373374/> 84 hours after the battle had started.<ref>{{harvnb|Nova TV|5 August 2011}}</ref>

As Tu<U+0111>man ordered the cessation of military operations that afternoon, the ARSK Kordun Corps accepted surrender. Negotiations of the terms of surrender were held the same day at 1:20&nbsp;p.m. at the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] UNCRO troops command post in Glina, and the surrender document was signed at 2&nbsp;p.m. in Topusko. Croatia was represented by Lieutenant General Stipeti<U+0107>, while the RSK was represented by Bulat, commander of the ARSK Kordun Corps, and Interior Minister To<U+0161>o Paji<U+0107>. The terms of surrender specified the handover of weapons, except officers' side arms, on the following day, and the evacuation of persons from Topusko via Glina, Sisak, and the Zagreb&ndash;Belgrade motorway to Serbia, protected by the Croatian military and civilian police.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=111<U+2013>112}}</ref>

On 9 August, the special police surrendered their positions to the HV, after covering more than {{convert|150|km|abbr=off}} on foot in four days.<ref name=Marijan78/> The 1st Guards Brigade, followed by other HV units, entered Vrginmost. The 110th and the 143rd Home Guard Regiments conducted mopping up operations around Vrginmost and [[Lasinja]].

On 4 August 1995, the CAF had at its disposal 17 [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21s]], five attack and nine transport helicopters, three transport airplanes and two reconnaissance aircraft. On that first day of the operation, thirteen MiG-21s were used to destroy or disable six targets in the Gospi<U+0107> and Zagreb Corps AORs, at the cost of one severely and three slightly damaged jets. The same day, three [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8s]] were used for [[medical evacuation]].<ref name=Marijan119>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=119<U+2013>121}}</ref> [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6Bs]] and [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18s]] on patrol as part of [[Operation Deny Flight]] fired on ARSK [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) sites at Udbina and Knin as SAM radars locked onto the jets.<ref>{{harvnb|NATO|4 July 1997}}</ref> A few sources claim that they were deployed as a deterrent as the UN troops came under HV fire,<ref>{{harvnb|Mueller|2000|loc=notes 77 & 81}}</ref> and a subsequent [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] report only notes that the deployment was a result of the deterioration of the military situation and resulting low security of the peacekeepers in the area.<ref name=UN23AUG3>{{harvnb|UNSC|23 August 1995|p=3}}</ref> Also on 4 August, the RSK [[105th Air Force Brigade]] based at Udbina, deployed helicopters against the Croatian special police on Velebit Mountain and against targets in the Gospi<U+0107> area virtually to no effect.<ref name=Marijan119/>

On 5 August, the RSK air force began evacuating to [[Banja Luka Zalu<U+017E>ani Airport|Zalu<U+017E>ani Airbase]] near Banja Luka, completing the move that day. At the same time the CAF deployed 11 MiG-21s to strike a communications facility and a storage site, as well as five other military positions throughout the RSK.  That day, the CAF also deployed a [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] to attack ARSK armour units near Sisak and five Mi-8s to transport casualties, and move troops and cargo. Five CAF MiG-21s sustained light damage in the process. The next day, jets struck an ARSK command post, a bridge and at least four other targets near Karlovac and Glina. A Mi-24 was deployed to the Slunj area to attack ARSK tanks, while three Mi-8s transported wounded personnel and supplies. An additional pair of MiG-21s was deployed to patrol the Ivani<U+0107> Grad airspace and to intercept two VRS fighter jets, but they failed to do so due to fog in the area and their low level of flight.<ref name=Marijan119/> The VRS aircraft subsequently managed to strike the [[Petrokemija]] chemical plant in [[Kutina]].<ref name=UN23AUG6/>

On 7 August, two VRS air force jets attacked a village in the Nova Gradi<U+0161>ka area, just north of the Sava River&mdash;the international border in the area.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=128}}</ref> The CAF struck an ARSK command post, a storage facility and several tanks near Bosanski Petrovac.

==Other coordinated operations==
In order to protect areas of Croatia separated from Sectors North and South, the HV conducted defensive operations while the HVO started a limited offensive north of Glamo<U+010D> and [[Kupres, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Kupres]] to pin down part of the VRS forces, exploit the situation and gain positions for further advance.<ref name=Marijan124>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=124<U+2013>126}}</ref> On 5 August, the HVO 2nd and 3rd Guards Brigades attacked VRS positions north of [[Tomislavgrad]], achieving small advances to secure more favourable positions for future attacks towards [[<U+0160>ipovo]] and [[Jajce]], while tying down part of the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|pp=125<U+2013>126}}</ref> As a consequence of the overall battlefield situation, the VRS was limited to a few counter-attacks around Biha<U+0107> and Grahovo as it was short of reserves.<ref name=BB376/> The most significant counter-attack was launched by the VRS 2nd Krajina Corps on the night of 11/12 August.

===Operation Phoenix===
In eastern Slavonia, the HV [[Osijek]] Corps was tasked with preventing ARSK or Yugoslav Army forces from advancing west in the region, and counter-attacking into the [[SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia|ARSK-held area around Vukovar]]. The Osijek Corps mission was codenamed Operation Phoenix ({{lang-hr|Operacija Fenix}}). The Corps commanded the [[3rd Guards Brigade (Croatia)|3rd Guards]] and [[5th Guards Brigade (Croatia)|5th Guards]] Brigades, as well as six other HV brigades and seven Home Guard regiments. Additional reinforcements were provided in a form of specialized corps-level units otherwise directly subordinated to the HV General Staff, including a part of the Mi-24 gunship squadron. Even though artillery rounds and [[small arms]] fire were traded between the HV and the ARSK 11th Slavonia-Baranja Corps in the region, no major attack occurred.<ref name=Marijan124/> The most significant coordinated ARSK effort occurred on 5 August, when the exchange was compounded by three RSK air raids and an infantry and tank assault targeting [[Nu<U+0161>tar]], northeast of [[Vinkovci]].<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=127}}</ref> Operation Storm led the Yugoslav Army to mobilize and deploy considerable artillery, tanks and infantry to the border area near eastern Slavonia, but it took no part in the battle.<ref name=BB376>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=376}}</ref>

===Operation Maestral===
{{Distinguish|Operation Mistral 2}}
In the south of Croatia, the HV deployed to protect the Dubrovnik area against the VRS Herzegovina Corps and the Yugoslav Army situated in and around [[Trebinje]] and the [[Bay of Kotor]]. The plan, codenamed Operation Maestral, entailed deployment of the 114th, 115th and 163rd Brigades, the 116th and 156th Home Guard Regiments, the 1st Home Guard Battalion (Dubrovnik), the 16th Artillery Battalion, the 39th Engineers Battalion and a mobile [[coastal artillery]] battery. The area was reinforced on 8 August with the 144th Brigade as the unit completed its objectives in Operation Storm and moved to Dubrovnik. The CAF committed two MiG-21s and two Mi-24s based in Split to Operation Maestral. The [[Croatian Navy]] supported the operation deploying the [[Kor<U+010D>ula]], [[Bra<U+010D>]] and [[Hvar]] [[Marine (military)|Marine]] Detachments, as well as [[missile boat]]s, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], [[anti-submarine warfare]] ships and coastal artillery. In the period, the VRS attacked the Dubrovnik area intermittently using artillery only.<ref>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=125}}</ref>

Operation Storm became the largest European land battle since the Second World War,<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|2010|p=216}}</ref> encompassing a {{convert|630|km|adj=on}} frontline.<ref name=Goldstein252/> It was a [[decisive victory]] for Croatia,<ref>{{harvnb|Newark|2005|p=195}}</ref> restoring its control over {{convert|10400|km2|abbr=off}} of territory, representing 18.4% of the country.<ref name=Marijan137>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=137}}</ref> Losses sustained by the HV and the special police are most often cited as 174 killed and 1,430 wounded,<ref>{{harvnb|Nation|2003|p=190}}</ref> but a government report prepared weeks after the battle specified 211 killed or missing, 1,100 wounded and three captured troops. By 21 August, Croatian authorities recovered and buried 560 ARSK troops killed in the battle. The HV captured 4,000 [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]],<ref>{{harvnb|Sadkovich|1998|p=222}}</ref> 54 armoured and 497 other vehicles, six aircraft, hundreds of artillery pieces and over 4,000 infantry weapons.<ref name=Marijan137/> Four UN peacekeepers were killed&mdash;three as a result of HV actions and one as a result of ARSK activities&mdash;and 16 injured. The HV destroyed 98 UN observation posts.<ref>{{harvnb|UNSC|23 August 1995|p=2}}</ref>

The HV's success was a result of a series of improvements to the HV itself and crucial breakthroughs made in the ARSK positions that were subsequently exploited by the HV and the ARBiH. The attack was not immediately successful everywhere, but the seizing of key positions led to the collapse of the ARSK command structure and overall defensive capability.<ref name=BB374/> The HV's capture of Bosansko Grahovo just before Operation Storm and the special police's advance to Gra<U+010D>ac made Knin nearly impossible to defend.<ref>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=374<U+2013>375}}</ref> In Lika, two Guards brigades rapidly cut the ARSK-held area lacking tactical depth or mobile reserve forces, isolating pockets of resistance and placing the 1st Guards Brigade in a position that allowed it to move north into the Karlovac Corps AOR, pushing ARSK forces towards Banovina. The defeat of the ARSK at Glina and Petrinja, after heavy fighting, also defeated the ARSK Banija Corps, as its reserve became immobilized by the ARBiH. The ARSK force was capable of containing or substantially holding assaults by regular HV brigades and the Home Guard, but attacks by the Guards brigades and the special police proved to be decisive.<ref name=BB375>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|p=375}}</ref> Colonel [[Andrew Leslie (general)|Andrew Leslie]], commanding the UNCRO in the Knin area,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|4 August 1995}}</ref> assessed Operation Storm as a textbook operation that would have "scored an [[A+ (grade)|A-plus]]" by NATO standards.<ref name=Dunigan94>{{harvnb|Dunigan|2011|p=94}}</ref>

Even if the ARBiH had not provided aid, the HV would almost certainly have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj for less than a single day.<ref name=BB375/> The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.<ref name=BB376/>

The defeat of the RSK led the Bosnian Serbs to realise that a settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be negotiated as soon as possible,<ref name=BB374377>{{harvnb|CIA|2002|pp=374<U+2013>377}}</ref> and reversed the tide of the war against the Serbs,<ref name=Dunigan94/> giving US diplomacy a strong boost.<ref>{{harvnb|Daalder|2000|p=173}}</ref> The success of Operation Storm also represented a [[strategic victory]] in the Bosnian War as it lifted the siege of Biha<U+0107>,<ref name=Marijan134/> and allowed the Croatian and Bosnian leadership to plan a full-scale military intervention in the VRS-held Banja Luka area&mdash;one aimed at creating a new balance of power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a buffer zone along the Croatian border, and contributing to the resolution of the war.<ref name=BB374377/> The intervention materialized as [[Operation Mistral 2]] in September 1995. Combined with a [[1995 NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO air campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina]],<ref name=BB374377/> it led to the start of peace talks that would result in the [[Dayton Agreement]] a few months later.<ref>{{harvnb|Time|11 September 1995}}</ref> The development also led to the restoration of the remaining Serb-held areas in eastern Slavonia and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] to Croatian control through the [[Erdut Agreement]],<ref>{{harvnb|Ramet|Mati<U+0107>|2007|p=46}}</ref> ending the Croatian War of Independence in November.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|12 November 1995}}</ref>

The ease with which the HV achieved victory surprised many observers as Western intelligence services predicted a Croatian defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|p=173}}</ref> International reactions to Operation Storm quickly evolved from emotive arguments, supportive of either side in the battle, to those calmly assessing the situation on the ground.<ref name=Ahrens176>{{harvnb|Ahrens|2007|pp=176<U+2013>179}}</ref> UN officials and most international media criticised Croatia.<ref name=Sadkovich137>{{harvnb|Sadkovich|1998|p=137}}</ref> [[Carl Bildt]], an EU negotiator working for the former Yugoslavia, publicly condemned Croatia, while UN Special Representative Stoltenberg urged the UN Secretary General Personal Representative [[Yasushi Akashi]] to request NATO strikes against the HV.<ref name=Ahrens176/> German Foreign Minister [[Klaus Kinkel]] expressed regret but added that "...&nbsp;the years of Serb aggression&nbsp;... have sorely tried Croatia's patience".<ref>{{harvnb|Time|14 August 1995}}</ref> The US response was mixed. While [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Perry]] reflected favourably on the military development,<ref name=Sadkovich137/> the US ambassador to Croatia, [[Peter Galbraith]], declared his disapproval. On 10 August, the UN Security Council issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1009|Resolution 1009]] demanding that Croatia halt military operations, condemning the targeting of UN peacekeepers, and calling for the resumption of talks&mdash;but not calling for a HV withdrawal.<ref name=Ahrens176/> By 18 August, US diplomats on [[Robert Frasure]]'s team tasked to mediate in the Bosnian War believed Operation Storm lent their diplomatic mission a chance to succeed,<ref>{{harvnb|Holbrooke|1999|p=73}}</ref> reflecting the opinion of [[President of the United States|US President]] Bill Clinton that the Serbs would not negotiate seriously unless they sustained major military defeats.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|2010|pp=214<U+2013>215}}</ref>

In Serbia, Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> condemned the Croatian attack, but the Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>-influenced press also denounced the leadership of the RSK as being incompetent,<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|5 August 1995}}</ref> while the most extreme politicians, including [[Vojislav <U+0160>e<U+0161>elj]], demanded retaliation against Croatia.<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|6 August 1995}}</ref> Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karad<U+017E>i<U+0107>]] begged for the Yugoslav Army to help while accusing Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107> of treason.<ref>{{harvnb|The Independent|9 August 1995 (a)}}</ref>

In Croatia, HV units returning to their bases were given heroes' welcomes in numerous cities, and a [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Croatia|commemorative medal]] was created to be issued to HV troops who took part in the operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Narodne novine|7 August 1995}}</ref> On 26 August, Croatia organised the Freedom Train&mdash;a railroad tour taking Tu<U+0111>man and the bulk of Croatia's government officials, public personalities, journalists and the [[diplomatic corps]] in Croatia from Zagreb to Karlovac, Gospi<U+0107>, Knin and Split.<ref>{{harvnb|Tanner|2001|p=298}}</ref> Tu<U+0111>man gave a speech at each of the stops.<ref>{{harvnb|Office of the President}}</ref> In Knin, he declared: "[The Serbs] didn't even have time to collect their dirty currency and their dirty underwear.

==Refugee crisis==
[[File:Serb refugees leaving Croatia.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|Serb refugees fleeing from Croatia.|alt=A long refugee column on a road]]
The evacuation and following mass-exodus of the Serbs from the RSK led to a significant humanitarian crisis. In August 1995, the UN estimated that only 3,500 Serbs remained in Kordun and Banovina (former Sector North) and 2,000 remained in Lika and Northern Dalmatia (former Sector South), while more than 150,000 had fled to Yugoslavia, and 10,000&ndash;15,000 had arrived in the Banja Luka area.<ref name=UN23AUG3/> The number of Serb refugees was reported to be as many as 200,000 by the international media<ref>{{harvnb|BBC News|5 August 2005}}</ref> and international organizations.<ref>{{harvnb|UNHCR|20 June 2001}}</ref> Also, 21,000 [[Bosniak]] refugees from the former APWB fled to Croatia.<ref name=UN23AUG3/> After Operation Storm, the Republika Srpska ordered the expulsion of all Croats and Bosniaks from the Banja Luka area,<ref>{{harvnb|RFE|15 August 1995}}</ref> and 22,000 refugees fled to Croatia by the end of August.<ref>{{harvnb|Narodne novine|7 July 1998}}</ref> EU envoy Bildt accused Croatia of the most efficient ethnic cleansing carried out in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].<ref>{{harvnb|Pearl|Cooper|2002|p=224}}</ref> His view is supported by German historian Marie-Janine Calic,<ref>{{harvnb|Calic|2009|p=129}}</ref> but rejected by US ambassador Galbraith in a 2011 interview.<ref>{{harvnb|B92|19 April 2011}}</ref>

While approximately 35,000 Serb refugees, trapped with the surrendered ARSK Kordun Corps, were evacuated to Yugoslavia via Sisak and the Zagreb&ndash;Belgrade motorway,<ref name=Marijan111/> the bulk of the refugees followed a route through the Republika Srpska, arriving there via Dvor in Banovina or via Srb in Lika&mdash;two corridors to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina left as the HV advanced.<ref name=1996HRW9/> The two points of retreat were created as a consequence of the delay of a northward advance of the HV Split Corps after the capture of Knin, and the decision not to use the entire HV 2nd Guards Brigade to spearhead the southward advance from Petrinja.<ref name=Marijan134>{{harvnb|Marijan|2007|p=134}}</ref> The retreating ARSK, transporting large quantities of weaponry, ammunition, artillery and tanks, often intermingled with evacuating or fleeing civilians, had few roads to use.<ref name=1996HRW14/> The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by CAF jets,<ref name=1996HRW13>{{harvnb|HRW|1996|p=13}}</ref> and the HV, trading fire with the ARSK located close to the civilian columns.<ref>{{harvnb|HRW|1996|p=10}}</ref> The refugees were also targeted by ARBiH troops,<ref>{{harvnb|Vreme|10 August 2006}}</ref> as well as by VRS jets, and sometimes were run over by the ARSK Special Units Corps' retreating tanks.<ref>{{harvnb|Daki<U+0107>|2001|p=62}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|24sata|13 February 2009}}</ref> On 9 August, a refugee convoy evacuating from the former Sector North under the terms of the ARSK Kordun Corps' surrender agreement was attacked by Croatian civilians in Sisak.

[[File:Oluja traktor.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An elderly Serb refugee in a tractor trailer, after crossing the Yugoslav border|alt=An elderly woman sitting in the back of a utility trailer]]
Aiming to reduce evidence of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees in various parts of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade.<ref>{{harvnb|Thomas|1999|p=239}}</ref> The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Hungarian]] areas of [[Vojvodina]], and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]], leading to increased instability in those regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldman|1997|p=372}}</ref> Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region.<ref>{{harvnb|van Selm|2000|pp=4<U+2013>5}}</ref> After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants.<ref name=1996HRW40>{{harvnb|HRW|1996|p=40}}</ref> They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription.<ref>{{harvnb|Markotich|1996|p=125}}</ref> Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK.<ref name=1996HRW40/> In some areas, ethnic [[Croats of Vojvodina]] were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations.<ref>{{harvnb|The Guardian|14 June 1999}}</ref> Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.<ref>{{harvnb|The Baltimore Sun|13 August 1995}}</ref>

===Return of the refugees===
At the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, in 1991&ndash;1992, a non-Serb population of more than 220,000 was forcibly removed from Serb-held territories in Croatia, as the RSK was established.<ref name=Biondich>{{harvnb|Biondich|2004|p=438}}</ref> In the wake of Operation Storm, a part of those refugees, as well as Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, settled in a substantial number of housing units in the area formerly held by the ARSK, presenting an obstacle to the return of Serb refugees.<ref name=Grandits>{{harvnb|Leutloff-Grandits|2006|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref> {{As of|September 2010}}, out of 300,000&ndash;350,000 Serbs who fled from Croatia during the entire war,<ref name=HRW187>{{harvnb|HRW 18-7|2006|p=1}}</ref> 132,707 are registered as having returned,<ref name=State2010>{{harvnb|Department of State|8 April 2011}}</ref> but only 60&ndash;65% of those are believed to reside permanently in the country. However, only 20,000&ndash;25,000 more are interested in returning to Croatia.<ref name=HRW187/> {{As of|2010}}, approximately 60,000 Serb refugees from Croatia remained in Serbia.<ref>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|19 July 2010}}</ref>

The return of refugees has been hampered by several obstacles. These include property ownership and accommodation, as Croat refugees settled in vacated homes,<ref name=Grandits/> and Croatian war-time legislation that stripped the refugees once living in government-owned housing of their tenancy rights. The legislation was abolished after the end of the war,<ref name=HRW99>{{harvnb|HRW|1 January 1999}}</ref> and alternative accommodation is offered to returnees.<ref>{{harvnb|HRW 18-7|2006|pp=4<U+2013>8}}</ref> 6,538 housing units were allocated by November 2010. Another obstacle is the difficulty for refugees to obtain residency status or Croatian citizenship. Applicable legislation has been relaxed since, and by November 2010, Croatia has allowed the validation of identity documents issued by the RSK.<ref name=State2010/> Even though Croatia declared a general amnesty, refugees fear legal prosecution,<ref name=HRW99/> as the amnesty does not pertain to war crimes.<ref>{{harvnb|Narodne novine|27 September 1996}}</ref> The final obstacle to the return of refugees is the lack of vocational opportunities due to the poor economic situation in Croatia.<ref>{{harvnb|UNHCR|2013}}</ref>

== War crimes ==
{{Main|Trial of Gotovina et al}}
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY), set up in 1993 based on the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 827|UN Security Council Resolution 827]],<ref>{{harvnb|Schabas|2006|pp=3<U+2013>4}}</ref> indicted Gotovina, <U+010C>ermak and Marka<U+010D> for war crimes, specifically for their roles in Operation Storm, citing their participation in a [[joint criminal enterprise]] (JCE) aimed at the permanent removal of Serbs from the ARSK-held part of Croatia. The ICTY charges specified that other participants in the JCE were Tu<U+0111>man, <U+0160>u<U+0161>ak, and Bobetko and <U+010C>ervenko,<ref>{{harvnb|ICTY|17 May 2007}}</ref> however all except Bobetko were dead before the first relevant ICTY indictment was issued in 2001.<ref>{{harvnb|ICTY|21 May 2001}}</ref> Bobetko was indicted by the ICTY, but died a year later, before he could be extradited for trial at the ICTY.<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|30 April 2003}}</ref> The [[Trial of Gotovina et al]] began in 2008,<ref>{{harvnb|The New York Times|12 March 2008}}</ref> leading to convictions of Gotovina and Marka<U+010D> and the acquittal of <U+010C>ermak three years later.<ref>{{harvnb|ICTY|15 April 2011 (a)}}</ref> Gotovina and Marka<U+010D> were acquitted on appeal in November 2012,<ref>{{harvnb|ICTY|16 November 2012}}</ref> in a ruling that exonerated the two generals as well as Croatia's political leaders of the 1990s, as the ICTY no longer considered Operation Storm to have been aimed at ethnic persecution.<ref>{{harvnb|The Guardian|16 November 2012}}</ref>

The number of civilian casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed&mdash;156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murder&mdash;during the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]] disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period,<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsche Welle|4 August 2011}}</ref> however their report was rejected by the ICTY, when submitted as evidence, due to unsourced statements and double entries contained in the report.<ref>{{harvnb|ICTY|15 April 2011 (b)|p=30}}</ref> Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing.<ref>{{harvnb|RTS|18 November 2012}}</ref> The ICTY prosecutors set civilian deaths at 324.<ref>{{harvnb|ABC News|17 November 2012}}</ref>

Although it was very difficult to determine the number of properties destroyed during and after Operation Storm since a large number of houses sustained some degree of damage since the beginning of the war,<ref name=Biondich/> [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that more than 5,000 houses were destroyed in the area during and after the battle.<ref>{{harvnb|HRW|1996|p=19}}</ref> Out of the 122 [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Blaskovich|1997|p=96}}</ref>

{{As of|November 2012}}, Croatian authorities have received 6,390 reports of crimes committed in the area during or after Operation Storm and have convicted 2,380 persons for looting, arson, murders, war crimes and other illegal acts. As of the same date, 24 more trials of war crimes related to Operation Storm were in progress.<ref>{{harvnb|Ve<U+010D>ernji list|27 November 2012}}</ref> In 2012, Serbian authorities were investigating five cases of war crimes committed during Operation Storm.<ref>{{harvnb|B92|21 November 2012}}</ref> The military operation also allowed Croatian authorities access to areas where, {{as of|March 2012|lc=y}}, a total of 144 [[mass grave|mass]] and 1,200 individual graves have been discovered, in which a total of 3,809 Croatian civilians and military personnel were buried.<ref>{{harvnb|Index.hr|15 March 2012}}</ref>
