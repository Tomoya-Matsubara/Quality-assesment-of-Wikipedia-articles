He played college basketball for the [[University of Montana]] before moving to Europe where he played for teams in Turkey, Belgium and Germany.

== High school career ==
Qvale attended [[Williston High School (North Dakota)|Williston High School]] in [[Williston, North Dakota]]. He lettered in four sports, and was awarded a total of 12 varsity letters throughout his career <U+2013> four years in [[basketball]] and [[American football|football]], three in [[baseball]], and one in [[track and field]]. In basketball, he was named all-state three times, and all-conference on one occasion under head coach Mark Slotsve.

He averaged 21 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, and led the team to a conference championship behind a 22-4 record.<ref name=bio>{{cite web | url=http://www.gogriz.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/qvale_brian00.html | title=Brian Qvale Bio | work=GoGriz.com | accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>

Following his high school years, Qvale was listed as a two-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]] and [[247Sports.com]]. On August 17, 2006, he committed to Montana, and officially enrolled with [[University of Montana]] on June 30, 2007. He also considered [[Boise State Broncos men's basketball|Boise State]], [[Colorado State Rams men's basketball|Colorado State]], [[Portland State Vikings men's basketball|Portland State]], [[Utah State Aggies men's basketball|Utah State]], [[Washington State Cougars men's basketball|Washington State]] and [[Wyoming Cowboys basketball|Wyoming]] as possible college choices.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== College career ==
With the Montana Grizzlies, Qvale was recognized as one of the premier [[Center (basketball)|centers]] in the [[Big Sky Conference]]. He led the team in [[block (basketball)|blocks]] in his true freshman season, and ranked fourth in rebounding. In his sophomore year, Qvale was tied for being the top rebounder on Montana, and recorded his first double-double in the season opener against [[Colorado State Rams men's basketball|Colorado State]]. He was awarded the John Eaheart Memorial Award, given to the most outstanding defensive player on the team, after finishing his second season with 1.8 blocks per game. As a junior in 2009<U+2013>10, Qvale earned the title as the team's top rebounder and was second in blocks in the Big Sky. He also ranked 47th in the [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] under the category. He earned the John Eaheart Award for the second consecutive season. Prior to his final year with the Grizzlies, Qvale received comments from head coach [[Wayne Tinkle]], who said, "Brian is a guy who we saw grow up right before our eyes in the second half of the season, especially down the stretch. He's carrying himself a lot differently. He's got more pep in his step and he's a lot more confident. He knows that he is the man for us, and needs to be kind of like our enforcer as well as our go-to guy. If he stays comfortable in that role, we look for Brian to have just a huge senior season. A lot of our success will be based around a lot of what he can do on both ends of the floor for us." Qvale finished his stint with Montana averaging a team-high 7.1 rebounds per game, and became the second-leading scorer with 10.2 points each game. He ranked as one of the top shot-blockers in Big Sky Conference history.<ref name="bio" />
