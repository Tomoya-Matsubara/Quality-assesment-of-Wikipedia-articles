The '''1920 Kiev Offensive''' (or '''Kiev Operation'''), sometimes considered to have started the [[Soviet-Polish War]],<ref name="EB_RPW"/> was an attempt by the newly re-emerged [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], led by [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]], to seize central and eastern [[Ukraine]],<ref name=EB_RPW/> torn in the warring among various factions, both domestic and foreign, from [[Soviet]] control.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

The stated goal of the operation was to create a formally independent Ukraine,<ref name="Debo210"/> although much of the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian population]] were ambivalent as many viewed the Polish advance as a new occupation<ref name="ZerkMach"/> aimed at subordinating Ukraine under Polish rule,<ref name="Derh"/> while others greeted the Polish and allied Ukrainian forces as liberators.<ref name="Davies"/> With their loyalties divided, Ukrainians fought for both sides of the conflict.<ref name="Abbot"/>

A major military operation, this campaign was conducted from April to June 1920 by the [[Polish Army]] in [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|alliance]] with the forces of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] under the exiled nationalist leader [[Symon Petliura]], opposed by the [[Soviet]]s who claimed those territories for the [[Ukrainian SSR]] and whose [[Red Army]] also included numerous Ukrainians in its ranks.<ref name=Abbot/> Initially successful for the Polish army, which captured [[Kiev]] on May 7, 1920, the campaign was dramatically reversed. The ambivalence of the Ukrainian population<ref name="Roshwald_p144"/> prevented Pi<U+0142>sudski and Petliura from gaining the support they expected, and the allied Polish forces and Petlura's Ukrainians were forced to retreat under mounting pressure from a Red Army counteroffensive.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

==Prelude==
[[File:Petlyura Lisowski.jpg|thumb|200px|Polish General [[Antoni Listowski|Listowski]] (left) and exiled Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petlura]] (second from left) following Petlura's alliance with the Poles]]
[[File:Petlyura Sold UA.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Soviet Ukraine]]'s propaganda poster issued after the [[Polish-Ukrainian alliance|Petlura-Pi<U+0142>sudski alliance]]. The Ukrainian text reads: "Corrupt Petlura has sold Ukraine to the Polish landowners. Landowners burned and plundered Ukraine. Death to landowners and Petlurovites."]]

The government of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], with mounting attacks on its territory since early 1919, had lost control over most of Ukraine, which was controlled by several disparate powers: [[Denikin]]'s [[White movement|Whites]], the [[Red Army]] and pro-Soviet formations, the [[Makhnovism|Makhnovist]] [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Partisan Army]] claiming [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|significant territory]], the  [[Kingdom of Romania]] in the southwest, Poland, and various bands lacking any political ideology. The city of Kiev had undergone numerous recent changes of government. The Ukrainian People's Republic was established in 1917; a Bolshevik uprising was suppressed in January 1918. The Red Army took it in February 1918, followed by the Army of the [[German Empire]] in March; Ukrainian forces retook the city in December. During February 1919 the Red Army regained control; in August it was taken first by [[Symon Petlura]]'s men and then by Denikin's army. The Soviets regained control in December 1919.<ref name="Studies in Contemporary Jewry: The Jews and the European Crisis, 1914<U+2013>1921"/>

At the time of the offensive, the forces of the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader Petlura, who formally represented the Ukrainian People's Republic, controlled only a small sliver of land near the Polish border.<ref name="Watt"/> Under these circumstances, Petlura saw no choice<ref name="Pidl"/> but to accept [[Pi<U+0142>sudski]]'s offer to join the alliance with Poland despite many unresolved territorial conflicts between these two nations;<ref name=Debo210/> on April 21, 1920 they signed the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]. In exchange for agreeing to a border along the [[Zbruch River]], Petlura was promised military help in regaining the Soviet-controlled territories with [[Kiev]], where he would again assume the authority of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR).<ref>O. Halecki. ''A history of Poland.'' Dorset House Publishing Co Inc. 1992. p. 286.</ref><ref>S. G. Payne. ''Civil War in Europe, 1905-1949''. Cambridge University Press. 2011. p. 55.</ref><ref>N. Davies. ''God's Playground, A History of Poland. Vol 2: 1795 to the Present.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 379.</ref>

For the Petlura's acceptance of the Poland's territorial advances it obtained from defeating the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (WUNR), a Ukrainian statehood attempt in [[Volhynia]] and Eastern part of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], largely Ukrainian populated but with significant Polish minority, Petlura was promised military help in regaining the Soviet-controlled territories with Kiev, where he would again assume the authority of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. The treaty was followed by a formal alliance signed by Petlura and Pi<U+0142>sudski on April 24. On the same day, Poland and UPR forces began the ''Kiev Operation'', aimed at securing the Ukrainian territory for the Petlura's government thus creating a buffer for Poland that would separate it from Russia.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

Following the formal restoration of Ukrainian independence, the Ukrainian state was then supposed to subordinate its military and economy to Warsaw<ref name=Debo210/> through joining the Polish-led "[[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze]]" federation of East-Central European states, as Pi<U+0142>sudski wanted Ukraine to be a buffer between Poland and Russia rather than seeing Ukraine again dominated by Russia right at the Polish border.<ref name="PolSize"/><ref name="FreeFromRU"/> Separate provisions in the treaty guaranteed the rights of the Polish and Ukrainian minorities within both states and obliged each side not to conclude any international agreements against each other.<ref name=Debo210/><ref name="Watt"/><ref name="Encyclopedia"/>

As the treaty legitimized the Polish control over the territory that the Ukrainians viewed as rightfully theirs, the alliance received a dire reception from many Ukrainian leaders, ranging from [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]<ref name="Pyrig"/> former chairman of the [[Tsentralna Rada]], to [[Yevhen Petrushevych]], the leader of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] that was forced into exile after [[Polish-Ukrainian War]]. However, such objections were brushed aside.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

The initial expedition in which sixty-five thousand Polish and fifteen thousand Ukrainian soldiers<ref name="Subtelny"/> took part started on April 24, 1920. The military goal was to outflank the Soviet forces and destroy them in a single battle. After winning the battle in the South, the Polish General Staff planned a speedy withdrawal of the 3rd Army and strengthening of the northern front where Pi<U+0142>sudski expected the main battle with the Red Army to take place. The Polish southern flank was to be held by Polish-allied Ukrainian forces under a friendly government in Ukraine. On May 7, Polish and Ukrainian soldiers entered Kiev.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

Pilsudski's forces were divided into three armies.  Arranged from north to south, they were the 3rd, 2nd and 6th, with Petliura's forces attached to the 6th army.  Facing them were the Soviet 12th and 14th armies led by [[Alexander Ilyich Yegorov]].  Pilsudski struck on April 25, and captured [[Zhytomyr]] the following day.  Within a week, the Soviet 12th army was largely destroyed.  In the south, the Polish 6th Army and Petliura's forces pushed the Soviet 14th army out of central Ukraine as they quickly marched eastward through [[Vinnytsia]].<ref name="Watt"/>  The combined Polish-Ukrainian forces entered [[Kiev]] on May 7, encountering only token resistance. On May 9 the Polish troops celebrated the capture of Kiev with the [[victory parade]] on [[Kreschatyk]], the city's main street. However as the parading troops were Pi<U+0142>sudski's Poles instead of Petlura's Ukrainians, the Kievans watched this demonstration of force with great ambivalence, which looked to them just like another occupation army.<ref name="ZerkMach"/>  Following this parade, however, all Polish forces were withdrawn from the city and control was given to the Ukrainian 6th division under the control of Petlura's Ukrainian government.<ref name="Kutrzeba"/>

On April 26, in his "Call to the People of Ukraine", Pi<U+0142>sudski assured that "the Polish army would only stay as long as necessary until a legal Ukrainian government took control over its own territory".<ref name="Odezwa"/> Despite this, many Ukrainians were just as anti-Polish as anti-Bolshevik,<ref name="Suny"/> and resented the Polish advance,<ref name="Cienciala"/> which many viewed as just a new variety of occupation<ref name="ZerkMach"/> considering previous defeat in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]].<ref name="Roshwald_p144"/> Thus, Ukrainians also actively fought the Polish invasion in Ukrainian formations of the [[Red Army]].<ref name="Abbot"/> The [[Soviet propaganda]] also had the effect of encouraging negative Ukrainian sentiment towards the Polish operation and Polish-Ukrainian history in general.<ref name="Cienciala"/><ref name="Frankel et al."/><ref name="Opaska"/><ref name="Referat"/><ref name="RobPot"/><ref name="OMP"/>

The success of the joint Polish-Ukrainian political campaign depended on the creation of a strong Ukrainian army capable of defeating the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] in Ukraine. While initially successful, the campaign ultimately failed. The local population was tired of hostilities after several years of war and the Ukrainian Army never exceeded two divisions largely due to the ambivalent attitude of Ukrainians towards the alliance. Petliura was only able to recruit 20,000<U+2013>30,000 additional soldiers into his army, a number insufficient to hold back the Soviet forces.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

However the Bolshevik army, although having suffered some defeats, avoided total destruction. The Polish offensive stopped at Kiev and only a small bridgehead was established on the eastern bank of the [[Dnieper]].{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

=== Soviet counterattack ===
The Polish-Ukrainian military thrust soon met the [[Red Army]] counterattack. On May 24, 1920 the Polish-Ukrainian forces encountered the highly respected [[First Cavalry Army]] of [[Semjon Budyonny|Semyon Budionny]]. Two days later, Budionny's cavalry, with two major units from the Russian 12th Army, began an assault on the Polish forces centered around Kiev. After a week of heavy fighting south of the city, the Russian assault was repulsed and the front line restored. On June 3, 1920 another Russian assault began north of the city.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

Meanwhile, Polish [[military intelligence]] was aware of Russian preparations for a counteroffensive, and Polish commander-in-chief [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]] ordered the commander of  Polish forces on the Ukrainian Front, General [[Antoni Listowski]], to prepare for a strategic withdrawal. From the perspective of staff maps in [[Warsaw]], it was clear that the recently created Polish Army was too weak to withstand both the offensive in the southern, Ukrainian sector and the spring offensive being prepared by the Bolsheviks in [[Belarus]] and north of the [[Pripyat Marshes]]. However, the commander of the Polish 3rd Army in the vicinity of Kiev, General [[Edward Rydz-<U+015A>mig<U+0142>y]], was seeking a way to repulse the upcoming Russian assault rather than withdraw, and even proposed to the [[General Staff]] regrouping all his forces at [[Kiev]] and defending there until relieved. His plan was turned down by Pi<U+0142>sudski, who knew that no relief force could be prepared any time soon. He repeated his order to withdraw the Polish 3rd and 6th Armies from the Kiev area.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

=== Polish retreat ===
Repeated attacks by the Budionny's [[1st Cavalry Army]] eventually broke the Polish Ukrainian front on June 5 and on June 10 Polish armies were retreating along the entire front. On June 13 Kiev was evacuated and left to the Soviets.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

As the withdrawal was started too late, the forces of Rydz found themselves in an extremely difficult situation. Russian Golikov's and Yakir's Groups, as well as the 1st Cavalry Army managed to capture several strategically important positions behind the Polish lines and the risk of the Polish armies being surrounded and defeated became high. However, mostly due to lack of reconnaissance, poor command and conflicts within the staff of the South-Western Front, the Polish-Ukrainian units managed to withdraw in order and relatively unscathed. Such an outcome of the operation was equally unexpected by both sides. Although the Poles withdrew to their initial positions, they remained tied down in Ukraine and lacked sufficient strength to support the Polish Northern Front and strengthen defenses at the [[Auta River]] during the decisive battle that was soon to take place there. On the other hand, the Bolshevik objectives were not accomplished either and the Russian forces had to remain in Ukraine and got tied down with heavy fighting for the area of the city of [[Lw<U+00F3>w]].{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the defeat in Ukraine, the Polish government of [[Leopold Skulski]] resigned on the June 9, and a political crisis gripped Polish government for most of June.<ref name="Davies_WERS-126and160"/>  Bolshevik and later [[Soviet propaganda]] used the Kiev Offensive to portray the Polish government as imperialist aggressors.<ref name="Szczep"/><!--Davies mentions that too-->

==Controversies==
The mutual accusations by both parties of the conflict in violations of the basic rules of the war conduct were rampant and full of exaggerations. [[Norman Davies]] writes that "Polish and Soviet newspapers of that time competed in which could produce a more terrifying portrait of their opponent."<ref name="Davies_WERS-243-244pl"/> Soviet propaganda claimed that Poles destroyed much of Kiev's infrastructure, including the passenger and cargo railway stations, and other purely civilian objects crucial for the city functioning, such as the [[electric power station]], the city [[Sewage collection and disposal|sewerage]] and [[water supply]] systems as well as monuments such as [[St. Volodymyr's Cathedral]].<ref name="SovietSources"/> The Poles denied that they committed any such acts of vandalism, claiming that the only deliberate damage they carried out during their evacuation was blowing up [[Bridges in Kiev|Kiev bridges]] across the [[Dnieper River]],<ref name="bridges"/> for strictly military reasons.<ref name="endnote"/> The cathedral was not, in fact, destroyed.<ref name=endnote/> According to some Ukrainian sources, incidents of more controversial and not warranted by the military needs destruction in the city by the retreating Polish army have also occurred.<ref name="Destruction"/>

Accusations were made against the Soviet side as well. Richard Watt writes that the Soviet advance into Ukraine was characterized by mass killing of civilians and the burning of entire villages, especially by [[Budyonny]]'s cossacks, designed to instill a sense of fear in the Ukrainian population.<ref name="WattQuote"/> [[Norman Davies]] notes that on June 7 <U+2013> two days after breaking Polish frontline <U+2013> Budionny's 1st Army destroyed the bridges in [[Zhytomyr]], wrecked the train station and burned various buildings; on the same day it burned a hospital in [[Berdychiv]], with 600 patients and [[Red Cross]] nuns, and that such terror tactics were common for Budionny's Cossacks.<ref name="Davies_WERS-123-124pl"/> According to ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', in the pacification of Ukraine that began during the Soviet counteroffensive in 1920 and which would not end until 1922 the Soviets would take tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.<ref name="BlackBook"/>

[[Isaac Babel]], a war correspondent embedded with the [[Red Army]], in his diary wrote down first-hand accounts of atrocities committed by the Polish troops and their allies during their retreat (particularly notorious were the regiment of the Cossack defector [[Vadim Yakovlev]] who switched sides and became a Polish ally). The retreating Polish army instilled fear among the civilian population, especially the Jews who suffered from multiple [[pogrom]]s committed by the Cossack troops.<ref name="Babel"/> Babel also describes the murders of the Polish [[POW]]s by the Red Army troops and looting of the civilian population by Budyonny's Red Cossacks.<ref name="babel"/> Babel's writings became so known that Budionny himself protested against "defamation" of his troops.<ref name="Davies_WERS-243-244pl"/>

== Order of battle ==
The following is the Order of Battle of Polish and Bolshevik forces taking part in the struggles in [[Ukraine]], as of April 25, 1920. It should be noted that the command structure of both sides changed during the operation. Also, the Russian forces were joined by Budennyi's [[1st Cavalry Army]] in the latter part of the operation, while a large part of the Polish forces was withdrawn by then to Belarus.{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

Among [[Polish Airforce]] was the 7th [[Ko<U+015B>ciuszko Squadron]].{{Fact|date=August 2012}}

# {{note|myref-25}} The outcome of the Polish and Bolshevik operations in Ukraine is sometimes disputed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Neither the Poles nor the Russians forced their opponent to fight a major battle or outflanked his forces and destroyed them, which was the main military goal of operations for both sides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, the Kiev offensive was a severe blow to [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]]'s plans for a [[Mi<U+0119>dzymorze]] federation.<ref name="Famine in Soviet Russia 1919 1923: The Operation of the American Relief Administration: The Operations of the American Relief Administration"/> As such, the operation may be viewed as a defeat for Pi<U+0142>sudski, as well as for Petliura.

<ref name="Debo210">"Although the [UNR] was unable to contribute real strength to the Polish offensive, it could offer a certain camouflage for the naked aggression involved. Warsaw had no difficulty in convincing the powerless Petliura to sign a treaty of alliance. In it he abandoned his claim of all territories [...] demanded by Pilsudski. In exchange the Poles recognized the sovereignty of the UNR on all territories which it claimed, including those within the Polish frontiers of 1772 <U+2013> in other words, much of the area Poland demanded from Soviet Russia. Petlura also pledged not to conclude any international agreements against Poland and guaranteed full cultural rights to the Polish residents in Ukraine.

<ref name="Derh">"''No less influential and popular than the concept of [national democrats] was the "federalist" program of Josef Pilsudski, a socialist and the most authoritative Polish political of the 20th century. The essence of that program was that after the ovethrowal of tsardom and the disintegration of the Russian empire, the large, strong and mighty Poland was to be created in Eastern Europe. It was the reincarnation of the Rzeczpospolita on "federative" principles. It was to include the Polish, Lithuanian, Belarusian and Ukrainian lands. The leading role, of course, was to be given to the Polish ethnic, political, economic and cultural element. Despite the program's failure to address the question on what to do if the people would not want to join the Rzeczpospolita, the socialists declared a voluntary entry into the future state."<br>Oleksandr Derhachov (editor), "Ukrainian Statehood in the Twentieth Century: Historical and Political Analysis", Chapter: "Ukraine in Polish concepts of the foreign policy", 1996, Kiev ISBN 966-543-040-8</ref>
