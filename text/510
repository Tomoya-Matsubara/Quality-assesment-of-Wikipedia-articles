==Career in the 1990s==
In 1992, Maxus purchased Daley & Company, a small Cleveland discount investment firm from [[Wedbush Securities]].<ref>"Maxus Acquires Daley Securities," written by Dan Shingler, Crain's Cleveland Business, January 2<U+2013>8, 1995, Volume 16, No. 1</ref>  Several years later Maxus was able to expand assets under management with the purchase of Gelfand Partners.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kristen Baird |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/19970407/SUB/704070706 |title=MAXUS PLANS MERGER DEAL WITH GELFAND |publisher=Crain's Cleveland Business |date=1997-04-07 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref> The acquisition doubled the size of the assets under management and diversified the product offerings to include [[Fixed Income]]. The combined companies had over $2 billion in [[assets under management]]. Terrence Johnson, a writer for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, called Barone "a self-described dreamer that has single-handedly turned a three-man operation...into one of the biggest players in Cleveland's money management sector".<ref>"Maxus Founder is Building Diversified Success Quietly", written by Terrence L. Johnson, ''The Plain Dealer'', March 10, 1996, Business Section</ref>

In 1999, [[First Security Corporation]] purchased the Comstock Bank of Nevada.<ref>{{cite news|author=Published: January 14, 1999 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/14/business/company-news-first-security-to-swap-stock-for-comstock-bancorp.html |title=Company News; First Security To Swap Stock For Comstock Bancorp |publisher=New York Times |date=1999-01-14 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>  Comstock was a state chartered [[FDIC]] bank, financed and controlled by Barone and investors.<ref>"Local Investors Reap Rewards of Reno Gamble," by Christopher Serres, Crain's Cleveland Business, February 22, 1999</ref> At the closing of the transaction.

Other notable acquisitions in the 1990s included positions in publicly traded companies such as Park Ohio,<ref>"Merger talk fuels Park-Ohio Stock," by Nancy M. Funk, Cleveland Plain Dealer, February 9, 1991</ref> Rockefeller Center Properties,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1994/07/25/79562/index.htm | work=CNN | first=Terence P. | last=Pare | title=LEARNING TO LIVE WITH DERIVATIVES They're here, they're weird, and they're not going away.

Johnson, Cleveland Plain Dealer, March 10, 1996</ref> a New York based money management firm.  During the late 1990s the Maxus Investment Group purchased an ownership position in Donna Karan. In December 2000, Louis Vuitton had plans to purchase Donna Karan, at a price which Barone felt was low. The offer price was eventually raised by $22 million.<ref>"LVMH's Offer for DKI Deemed on Low Side," by Lisa Marsh, The New York Post, December 20, 2000</ref> <ref> {{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/11/business/fi-rup11.8 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Donna Karan Settlement Approved | date=September 11, 2002}}</ref> <ref>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/jan/14/theobserver.observerbusiness6</ref>

==Later career==
In 2001, Barone sold the Maxus Investment Group to [[Fifth Third Bank]].  At the time Barone stated,  "With what's going on in the industry today, we thought we needed to team up with a premier institution to be able to offer our clients a greater product line and services." <ref>Fifth Third Agrees to Buy Maxus Investment," by Mary Vanac, ''The Plain Dealer'', October 4, 2000, Business Section</ref>

With that sale, [[Fifth Third Bank]] decided that they were not interested in Daley Securities{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} which Maxus had purchased in 1992. Barone purchased Daley back and converted its operation into a Friends and [[Family office]]. By 2005, Daley's business began to grow and with the return of several Maxus Investment Group executives, Daley became the nucleus for the formation of The Ancora Group Inc., an [[investment management]] firm which Barone currently chairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancora.net/ancora-executive-committee |title=Ancora Executive Committee &#124; Ancora Advisors |publisher=Ancorat |date=2013-08-21 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>

Barone recently{{when|date=December 2013}} launched The Arch Eagle Group Inc., a provider of investment services to investment professionals such as [[hedge fund]] managers, investment advisors and other small broker-dealers. In 2011, he was elected Chairman of [[Mace Security International]], a pepper spray products and personal protection company which he helped refinance.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2011/07/18/mace-security-international-names.html | title=Mace Security International names Barone chairman}}</ref>

==Investment philosophy==
Barone's investment philosophy which has been developed over the last 45 years, is based on [[value investing]]. In the early 1970s, recalling several conversations with investor [[Warren Buffett]], Barone concluded that several aspects of value are important to a transaction. According to Barone, these comprised branded products, pricing power, and free cash flow relative to market price. Investments in publicly traded corporations should only be made at corresponding values one would make if buying the whole company in a private transaction. According to Barone, volatility and uncertainty are good for creating investment opportunities, not a detriment.  "When we see prices drop, that just means we're buying businesses at even less.".<ref name=WST>"Money Manager Interview", ''The Wall Street Transcript'', May 8, 2000</ref>

Barone's investment history has been written about in ''Barron's'',<ref>"2009's Big Winners See Slim Pickings Ahead", by Suzanne McGee, ''Barron's Magazine'', October 12, 2009</ref> ''[[The Wall Street Transcript]]'',<ref name="WST" /> ''New York Times'',<ref>"Riding Out Ugly Times, In Theory Any Way", by Virginia Munger Kahn, ''New York Times'', June 8, 1997</ref> and Individual Investor.<ref>"Maxus' Maxims", by Steven B. Kaufman, ''Individual Investor'', September, 1995</ref>

==Boardships==
In 2002, Barone joined the Board of the [[Cleveland State University]] Foundation. The Foundation works closely with Cleveland State's Office of University Advancement on fund raising projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csuohio.edu/offices/advancement/csufoundation/ |title=CSU Foundation |publisher=Cleveland State University |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>  In 2008, Barone became Chairman of the Cleveland State University Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csuohio.edu/news/releases/2008/06/14517.html |title=News |publisher=Cleveland State University |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>  In that same year, Barone became a community member of the Cleveland State University Board of Trustees.

In 2007, Barone was elected to the Board of Directors of The Stephan Company, a publicly traded manufacturer and distributor of haircare and skincare products.

In January 2008, Barone was elected to the Board of Directors of The Brentwood Foundation.  The Brentwood Foundation, now part of the [[Cleveland Clinic]] Health Organization, was established in 1994 as a charitable trust dedicated to the promotion and advancement of medical education, clinical research, and community initiatives that impact health and wellness in the field of osteopathic medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brentwood-foundation.org/about.aspx |title=The Brentwood Foundation ~ About Us |publisher=The Brentwood Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref>

In the Fall of 2008, Barone was elected to the Board of Directors for the Hospice of the Western Reserve.<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Mezger |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2008/11/on_the_go_12.html |title=On the Go |publisher=The Plain Dealer |date=2008-11-02 |accessdate=2013-09-12}}</ref> He began serving his tenure in January, 2009. Prior to being elected to the Board of Directors, Barone provided both financial and investment consulting services to the organization, which provides hospice services throughout Northeast Ohio.

On March 31, 2009, Barone was elected to the Board of Directors of Mace Security International.  Mace Security International is a publicly traded company which offers personal defense sprays, home and business surveillance and security, automotive security and child safety and security.  Dennis Raefield, CEO and President of Mace, said "we are excited to have Mr. Barone as a member of the Mace Board as he was elected by a unanimous vote.  Mace is currently executing an aggressive turnaround strategy and we welcome Mr. Barone's guidance during this time as we strive to increase sales." <ref>"Mace Security International Elects Richard A.
