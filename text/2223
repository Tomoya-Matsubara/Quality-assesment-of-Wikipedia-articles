'''St Mary's Church''' is a parish church in [[Hunton, Kent|Hunton]], [[Kent]]. It was begun in the late 11th or the 12th century and is a Grade I [[listed building]].

==Building==
The church was begun in the late 11 century or in the 12th century and was altered and extended in the 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th and 19th centuries. The church is constructed of [[course (architecture)|uncoursed]] [[rag-stone]] rubble and has plain tiled roofs. It was restored in 1876 by [[Ewan Christian]].<ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE |num=1250030 |desc=Church of St Mary |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>

The [[nave]] is adjoined by an [[Aisle#Architecture|aisle]] on the south side and the [[chancel]] has a chapel on its south side and a vestry to its north. The west tower is 13th century and comprises three stages divided by [[ashlar]]ed stone bands. The outer facing corners have diagonal [[buttress]]es. Single [[lancet window]]s punctuate the north, south and west sides of the second and third stages. The [[spire]] is pyramidal with wood [[shingle]] covering, which also covers the [[lean-to]] roof of the stair turret on the south-east side of the tower.<ref name=NHLE/> 

The south aisle is 15th century. The rubble wall has a single buttress adjacent to the south porch on the west end and a plain parapet. A pair of two-lighted rectangular windows are on the south side and a two-lighted pointed arch window is in the west end. The porch is diagonally buttressed on the outer corners with a gabled roof. The south chapel was rebuilt or refaced in 1866 in with two-lighted rectangular windows in 15th century style. The north wall of the nave is from the late 11th century or from the 12th century with [[quoin]]s of [[tufa]] stone. Two two-lighted windows [[tracery|traceried]] with [[quatrefoil]] and sexfoil decoration are late 13th century or early 14th century. A 15th century three-lighted window is located in the centre of the north fa<U+00E7>ade. The chancel is mostly 13th century with elements contemporaneous with the nave. The three-lighted east window is 19th century, but in 15th century style. The north fa<U+00E7>ade contains a broad lancet window. The vestry was probably added in 1866 and has two lancet windows on the north side and a doorway on the west.<ref name=NHLE/>

Internally, the nave is separated from the aisle with a 15th-century arcade of three [[bay (architecture)|bays]] of pointed arches with octagonal columns. The tower and chancel arches are 13th century and 14th century respectively. The arches from the chancel to the vestry and chapel and between the aisle and chapel are all 19th century. The nave has a [[crown post]] roof with moulded posts and [[chamfer]]ed tie beams. The chancel roof is boarded and the roof to the chapel is scissor braced.<ref name=NHLE/> 

The south wall of the chancel contains a [[Sussex Marble|Bethersden Marble]] 13th century double [[sedile]] at its east end with a [[piscina]] in the south-east corner. The [[Baptismal font|font]] is octagonal with traceried panels.<ref name=NHLE/>
