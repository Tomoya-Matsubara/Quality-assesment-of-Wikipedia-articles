'''Erie''' is a [[city]] in [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]], [[Pennsylvania]], on the coast of [[Lake Erie]]. As of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], the city had a total population of 103,717. The Northwest Pennsylvania region (of which Erie is the regional hub) has a population of 910,000 people.  It is the fourth most populated city in Pennsylvania, after [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] and [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]].  For most of the past century, Erie was Pennsylvania's third largest city by a large margin.  However, the industrial decline in the United States since the 1960s has been a major cause of the large population loss.  Erie was, and still is to a lesser extent, one of the United States' major manufacturing centers.  Since the early 1970s, Erie is estimated to have lost nearly 40,000 people.  This fact, coupled with Allentown's location amidst the rapid sprawl of Southeast Pennsylvania and New Jersey, has allowed Allentown to claim the 3rd largest spot.    

It is the [[county seat]] of [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]].{{GR|6}}

Erie is named after the adjacent lake, which is named after the [[Erie tribe]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who lived along its southern shore before European contact. Erie was also called the Gem City because of the sparkling lake. 

Erie is home to three highly popular amusement parks, [[Waldameer Park]], [[Conneaut Lake Park]] and Splash Lagoon. Six four year colleges are located in Erie, and Erie is home to [[Presque Isle State Park]], a park that draws over 4 million people every year. <ref>[http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/STATEPARKS/scavenger/scav8presque.aspx DCNR Visitor Info]</ref>
== History ==
Erie was first settled by the French, who built [[Fort Presque Isle]] in 1753, as part of their effort to garrison New France against the encroaching English. Presque Isle means "almost an island" in French. The fort was surrendered to the British, along with the rest of New France, at the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763.

The City of Erie was part of the [[Erie Triangle]] that was claimed by the states of [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Connecticut]] (as part of its [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]]), and [[Massachusetts]]. It officially became part of Pennsylvania in 1792, after all four states renounced their claims and the federal government sold the area to Pennsylvania. The city was founded in 1795 and laid out by the famous surveyor Joseph Ellicott, who also completed the planning of Washington D.C.

During the [[War of 1812]], President James Madison ordered the construction of a naval fleet at Erie in order to regain control of Lake Erie.  Noted shipbuilders Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of New York led construction of four schooner-rigged gunboats and two brigs.  Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] arrived from Rhode Island to command the squadron.  His fleet successfully fought the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in the historic [[Battle of Lake Erie]], which was the decisive victory that solidified United States control of the [[Great Lakes]].

===Site of the 1853 Railroad Gauge War===

The city of Erie was the site where two different sets of gauges (width between tracks) met.  The different gauges became a huge problem for western expansion because of the delays caused by the need to unload, and then reload trains.  The delays subsequently created many jobs in Erie which became endangered when a national standardized gauge was proposed.  The citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track, and in general did everything imaginable to delay the inevitable standardization.

==Culture==
Erie is home to a number of professional and amateur performing-arts groups. The most significant is the [http://www.eriephil.org Erie Philharmonic Orchestra,] in continuous existence since 1913 (with the exception of an [[interregnum]] during [[World War II]]). This group of professional musicians also has a full [[Choir|chorus]] and a Junior [[Philharmonic]] division which actively tours the area.

The [http://www.lakeerieballet.org/ Lake Erie Ballet] is a professional ballet company which puts on a number of performances of well-known ballets throughout the year.

The [http://www.eriecivicmusic1.com Erie Civic Music Association] attracts, sponsors, and books performances by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from the world over.

Downtown Erie's historic and ornate [[Warner Theatre (Erie, Pennsylvania)|Warner Theater]] hosts performances by all three groups. Renovated in the 1980s and again in 2007 , the Warner serves as the hub of Erie's [[Louis J. Tullio Arena|Civic Center]] [http://www.visiteriepa.com/erie_civic_center_complex1.shtml]. The downtown area is also the home of the Erie Playhouse, one of the leading community theaters in the country, as well as [http://www.roadhousetheatre.org The Roadhouse Theatre for Contemporary Art] , home to more avant-garde works. The Great Lakes Film Association, which hosts the Great Lakes Independent Film Festival every year in the fall, promotes independent films. 

The [[Erie Art Museum]] [http://www.erieartmuseum.org] is Erie's premier art gallery, located in a former U.S. Customs House on lower State Street near the bayfront. Its collection has a particular emphasis on folk arts and modern styles. It also hosts a popular [[blues]] and [[jazz]] concert series.

Along West 6th St. is Millionaire's Row. There stands a collection of 19th century Victorian houses/mansions. The oldest lighthouse on all of the Great Lakes stands at the foot of Lighthouse Street in the city. The lighthouse was built in 1818 and replaced in 1867.

Construction of the [[Bicentennial Tower]], located on [[Dobbins Landing]] at the foot of State Street, began during the city's 200th year in 1995.  Construction was finished in 1996. It is 187 feet tall and gives a great view of Lake Erie and it's surroundings.  

[[Presque Isle Downs]] opened for business on [[February 28]], [[2007]], the fourth slots parlor in the state and the first in western Pennsylvania. There are 2,000 slot machines as of opening day, and the adjoining racetrack is scheduled to open in September 2007.

{{PennPlaceMap|Erie|Erie|280px}}
Erie is well-situated on major transportation lines, leading in part to its relative health as a light-to-medium industrial center in the face of dramatic declines in the Great Lakes states.

Three interstate highways join in or near the city: [[Interstate 90]] (Boston to Seattle); [[Interstate 79]], which begins in Erie and ends in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]; and [[Interstate 86 (east)]], the "Southern Tier Expressway," which begins east of Erie and runs along the southern half of New York State to [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]] and beyond. Also running through or near the city are the arterial roads [[U.S. Highway 20]], [[U.S. Highway 19]] (also known as [[Peach Street]]), [[U.S. Highway 6]]N and PA Route 8, which begins in Erie and ends in Pittsburgh, Pa.

The former "Water Level Route" of the [[New York Central]] Railroad (now the [[CSX]] mainline) travels directly through Erie. This is a major mainline for the railroad and sees scores of trains a day. The mainline of the [[Norfolk Southern]] Railroad at one time ran directly down the middle of 19th Street in the city.  The 19th Street tracks were recently removed.  The 19th Street rail traffic is now routed onto the aforementioned transcontinental mainline.  

An [[Amtrak]] train calls on the city twice daily (at 1:36 AM for the westbound train and 8:30 AM for the eastbound one) at [[Union Station (Erie)|Union Station]] in downtown Erie: the [[Lake Shore Limited]], running between [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], and [[Chicago]]. Amtrak recently annonced that the 5:39 AM departure would be pushed up to 8:30 AM. <ref>[http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070403/WSEE01/70403026&SearchID=73277536491212 Erie Times News Article on New Train Service]</ref>Although there has been much discussion in recent years in favor of adding  trains along the southern shore of [[Lake Erie]] to link [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] with [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], and beyond, in light of Amtrak's perpetual budget woes, this will likely not take place in the near future.

[[Erie International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: ERI; [[International Civil Aviation Organization|IACO]]: KERI), located 5 miles (8&nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) southwest of the city, hosts [[general aviation]], charter, and scheduled [[airline]] service. Airlines currently serving Erie include [[Comair]] ([[Delta Air Lines]] Connection), [[Continental Airlines|Continental Connection]], [[US Airways]] and [[Northwest Airlines]]. The Erie airport has recently been recognized by the [[Pennsylvania]] Department of Transportation as the fastest-growing airport in the state and by the US Department of Transportation as the 3rd fastest-growing airport in the United States in 2004.<ref>[http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/ERIEAIR_NEWS/50304068 Erie Airport Stats]</ref>
[[Greyhound Lines]] runs regular scheduled bus service to and from Erie from many hubs, including Pittsburgh, Chicago, and New York City.

A new bus terminal opened in the spring of 2006, located in the heart of the Port of Erie.

The Port of Erie is an under-utilized facility located within Presque Isle Bay, a natural harbor. Currently, there is very little commercial shipping activity through the Port, save sand and gravel and miscellaneous [[coal]] shipments. Erie is a stop on the American Canadian Caribbean Cruise Line's Great American Waterways cruise. <ref>[http://www.accl-smallships.com/Cruise_Details.cfm?Cruise_ID=39 Cruise Itinerary]</ref>

The [[EMTA]] ([[Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority]]) bus system runs seven days a week in the city.

==Geography and Climate==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 72.5 [[km<U+00B2>]] (28.0 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]). 56.9 km<U+00B2> (22.0 mi<U+00B2>) of it is land and 15.6 km<U+00B2> (6.0 mi<U+00B2>) of it (21.54%) is water.
Erie is home to [[Presque Isle State Park]] (known to the locals as "The Peninsula"), a [[peninsula]] that juts out into [[Lake Erie]] and boasts numerous public beaches, wetlands, and good fishing locations. Erie currently stands 13 on the snowiest places in the United States, averaging 88 inches of snow.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/resources/askjack/2003-10-01-snowiest-cities_x.htm USA Today Snowiest Citys Chart]</ref> This winter, as of April 2007, Erie has received 107 inches of snow.<ref>[http://www.wjettv.com/weather/default.asp WJET Weather Stats]</ref>

== Recent Developments==
Recently, the Erie Downtown Improvement District (DID) contracted a Philadelphia-based company (Kise, Straw, & Kolodner) to set up a "master plan" for the city of Erie's downtown<ref>[http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007703150396 Erie Times News Article on Downtown Improvment]</ref>.  The DID plan includes building several mid-rise and high-rise structures which will be utilized primarily for housing and retail expansion in the city centre.  Fourth River Development and Radnor Property Group were selected as the developers.

[[American IG|GAF]], an asphalt shingle manufacturer recently announced (January 2007) plans to relocate to Eastern Pennsylvania<ref>[http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007701190378 Erie Times News Article on GAF Relocating]</ref>, thus making available several extremely valuable acres right next to the [[Bayfront Convention Center|Convention Center]] and hotel currently under construction.  A recent local newspaper poll shows that the majority of local citizens desire a park-like setting, followed by retail development in the area.

The major ethnic groups of the City of Erie are roughly broken down into 24.4% German, 14% Irish, 14% Polish, 13% Italian, 5.8% English, 1.7% Swedish, 1.7% French, 1.4% Russian, and the remaining 24% make up the <U+2018>other<U+2019> category (see
[http://www.helloerie.com/Social.cfm]).  

Recently, Erie has seen a great influx of families from [[Kosovo]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], to the extent that the city now has a Bosnian-American Cultural Center and a Bosnian Festival. Many of these immigrants are [[Muslim]]s and Orthodox Christian.

In the early 20th Century, Erie had a significant [[Russia]]n immigrant community, many of whom worked in the now-closed [[shipbuilding]] plants along the bayfront. Unusually for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were [[Old Believer]]s. Even today, the gold-domed ([http://www.churchofthenativity.net/]) Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Believer church ([http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/english/pages/firsttier/diocesesbishops.html]). Bishop Daniel of Erie, of the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]], is based in ([http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Daniel_(Alexandrow)_of_Erie]) Erie and is the Vicar President of the Synod of Bishops for the Old Believers.

Erie has a vibrant [[Jewish]] community that is over one hundred fifty years old. Temple Anshe Hesed ([http://www.taherie.org/]), a member of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]], is served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi John L. Bush.

Erie is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie and Northwestern Pennsylvania, covering 13 counties (9,936 sq. miles - the largest in the state).  Its diocesan seat is the Saint Peter Cathedral in Erie, which has a 265' central tower flanked by two 150' towers.  It is among the tallest churches in the U.S and was constructed in 1873.  

According to the Association of Religion Date Archives<ref>[http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/counties/42049_2000.asp ARDA Database]</ref> Erie county has 103,333 people who claim affiliation with the Catholic church, 59,541 people who claim affiliation with a Protestant church and 115,682 who were listed as unaffiliated.

==Economy==
As of 2005, the city's largest single employer is the [[locomotive]] builder [[GE Transportation]], which employs 4,000 people in neighboring Lawrence Park Township to the east. Apart from the General Electric plant, heavy industry is rapidly on the decline. However, smaller, high-precision companies are growing in size and scope. For example, [http://www.lord.com Lord Corporation], which specializes in shock- and vibration-damping products for the aerospace industry, was founded in and has major operations in Erie.

The plastics industry is also a significant employer, although most of these companies are small to medium-sized. Over 10% of the nation's plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants. These plants are supported by many locally-owned [[CNC]] [[machine tool]] job shops.
