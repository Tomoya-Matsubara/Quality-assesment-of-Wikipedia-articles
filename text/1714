{{otherships|HMS Lowestoffe}}

'''HMS ''Lowestoffe''''' was a 32-gun [[fifth rate]] [[frigate]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. Built during the latter part of the [[Seven Years War]], she went on to see action in the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolutionary War]], and served often in the Caribbean. ''Lowestoffe'' has become famous as the ship in which a young [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] served shortly after passing his lieutenant's examination. 

Originally commissioned near the end of the [[seven Years War]], ''Lowestoffe'' patrolled in British waters until 1773, when it underwent repairs. She was recommissioned in 1777 and served throughout the American War of Independence, including at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and the [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa]]. After the bulk of the fighting ended, she returned home to Portsmouth in 1782, and did not see battle for the next decade. She spent most of her later years in British and Mediterranean waters, winning particular glory for her part in an engagement with two French frigates in 1795. Her final duties were back in the familiar waters of the West Indies, where she was wrecked in 1801 while escorting a convoy in the [[Turks and Caicos Islands|Caicos Islands]].

==Construction and commissioning==
Sir [[Thomas Slade]]  based his design for ''Lowestoffe'' on that of {{HMS|Aurora|1757|6}}, which was a former French vessel named ''Abenakise''.<ref name="Winfield190">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=190}}</ref> (The Admiralty routinely "took the lines", i.e., drew up blueprints, of captured vessels, and these blueprints were available to designers such as Slade.) 

''Lowestoffe'' was the only ship built to her design, though over a decade later the Navy would have two more frigates, {{HMS|Orpheus|1773|6}} and {{HMS|Diamond|1774|6}}, built to a modification of the design of ''Lowestoffe'' and ''Abenakise''. <ref name="Winfield195">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=195}}</ref> She was ordered on 15 February 1760 from Thomas West, [[Deptford Dockyard]], with West contracted to launch her within 12 months, at a cost of <U+00A3>11.0.0d per ton.<ref name="Winfield190"/> ''Lowestoffe'' was laid down on 9 May 1760, launched on 5 June 1761 and completed by 1 August 1761.<ref name="Colledge">{{cite book |last=Colledge |title=Ships of the Royal Navy |page=205}}</ref> She officially received the name ''Lowestoffe'' on 28 October 1760.<ref name="Winfield190"/> She had cost a total of <U+00A3>7,715.1.10<U+00BE>d to build, coming in just slightly under the contracted price of <U+00A3>7887.  The Navy spent a further <U+00A3>4,281.7.8d on having her fitted out.<ref name="Winfield190"/>

==Career==
Commissioned late in the [[Seven Years War]], she saw little action under her first captain, Walter Stirling, and the Navy paid her off in 1762.<ref name="Winfield190"/> ''Lowestoffe'' was initially moored at [[Portsmouth]].  Then in early 1763 she was armed and stored, sailing on 26 July 1763 under the command of her new captain James Baker.<ref name="Winfield190"/><ref name="Goodwin56">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=56}}</ref> 

After spending some time cruising in the [[English Channel]] and stopping neutral merchants for inspections, Baker sailed ''Lowestoffe'' to Madeira and then on to the [[West Indies]].<ref name="Goodwin56"/> She arrived at [[Carlisle Bay]] on 13 September, and then sailed on to [[Antigua]].<ref name="Goodwin56"/> During her time at Carlisle Bay, ''Lowestoffe'' carried out patrols between Barbados and Antigua. <ref name="Goodwin56"/>

She was part of a squadron under Rear Admiral Tyrrell. Four vessels of the squadron, [[HMS Princess Louisa (1744)|''Princess Louisa'']], ''Lowestoffe'',  [[HMS Virgin (1764)|''Virgin'']] and [[HMS Beaver (1764)|''Beaver'']], shared in the prize money arising from the seizure in January and February 1764 of several vessels engaged in illicit trade near Dominica. The seized vessels were the ''Sarah'', ''Union'', ''Mary Anne'', ''Pastora'', ''Elizabeth'', ''Two Sisters'', and ''June and Betsey''.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 11283, 12 September 1772, p.3.</ref> 

Baker died on 31 March 1765.   His successor, Joseph Norwood, sailed ''Lowestoffe'' home to be paid off in August 1766.<ref name="Winfield190"/> ''Lowestoffe'' underwent a small repair at [[Sheerness]] between December 1766 and April 1767, and after a period out of service was recommissioned again in June 1769 under Captain Robert Carkett.<ref name="Winfield190"/> Carkett returned her to the West Indies in October that year, returning in May 1773 to Britain after four years at [[Jamaica]].<ref name="Winfield190"/> She was paid off in 1773, and reduced to a 28-gun [[Sixth-rate|Sixth Rate]].<ref name="Winfield190"/><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UccUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA85&hl=en&ei=8P_BTMT3F43anAfO4MiACg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Dictionary of National Biography|volume=9|location=London|year=1887|first=Leslie|last=Stephen|page=85}}</ref>

===American War of Independence===
''Lowestoffe'' now underwent a large repair. She was recommissioned under Captain [[William Locker (Royal Navy)|William Locker]] in early 1777 and prepared for service in the [[Leeward Islands]].<ref name="Winfield190"/> Joining her for this voyage was a young Lieutenant [[Horatio Nelson]], who had passed his examination on 9 April, and was joining the ''Lowestoffe'' as her second lieutenant.<ref name="Goodwin57">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=57}}</ref> Also serving on the ''Lowestoffe'' at this time was [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]], who would go on to have an enduring friendship with Nelson, serving with him on a number of occasions, including at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The ship sailed in early May, escorting a convoy to the West Indies, where they arrived in mid July.<ref name="Goodwin58">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=58}}</ref> She was [[copper sheathing|coppered]] at Jamaica and then went on a number of cruises, capturing an American [[sloop]] with a cargo of rice in August 1777.<ref name="Goodwin58"/> 

A second cruise saw the capture of an American [[privateer]], and a notable incident for Nelson. ''Lowestoffe'' sent her boat and first lieutenant to take over the prize, but the seas were too rough to allow the American to be boarded, so the lieutenant returned. Nelson stepped forward and volunteered to make an attempt; he succeeded.<ref name="Goodwin58"/>

On 25 March 1778 ''Lowestoffe'' captured the sloop ''Swan'', Daniel Smith, Master. She was of 60 tons, had a crew of seven men, and was carrying a cargo of molasses.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 11912, 22 September 1778, p.3</ref>

By the time of ''Lowestoffe''{{'}}s third cruise, Nelson had taken command of the ship's tender, the [[schooner]] ''Little Lucy''.<ref name="Goodwin58"/>  Locker and the ''Lowestoffe'' spent the rest of 1778 and the early part of 1779 carrying out routine cruises and patrols, until Captain Christopher Parker replaced him in March 1779.<ref name="Winfield190"/><ref name="Goodwin59">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=59}}</ref> Locker, who had by now been ill for some time, had recommended Nelson to [[Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker]], who found a space for Nelson aboard his [[flagship]], the 50-gun {{HMS|Bristol|1775|6}}.<ref name="Sugden128">{{cite book |last=Sugden |title=Dream of Glory |page=128}}</ref> Nelson joined her as third lieutenant on 1 July 1778.<ref name="Sugden128"/>

On 8 February 1779, ''Lowestoffe'' captured the ''Vigilant'', near the Bite (or Bight) of [[L<U+00E9>og<U+00E2>ne|Leogan]]. The 70 ton sloop was sailing from Dominique to Philadelphia with a cargo of sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, cotton and salt. John English was her Master and she had a crew of five men.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 11982, 25 May 1779, p.2.</ref>

''Lowestoffe'' became part of Captain John Luttrell's squadron and carried out operations in the [[Bay of Honduras]] in October and November 1779. On 17 October ''Lowestoffe'', together with [[HMS Pomona (1778)|''Pomona'']], [[HMS Charon (1778)|''Charon'']], and [[HMS Porcupine (1777)|''Porcupine'']] participated in the successful British attack on the [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|Fort of San Fernandino de Omoa]]. During the attack ''Lowestoffe'' exchanged fire with the fort. While she was doing this she ran aground. Her immobility made her an easy target for the fort's guns. Eventually boats were able to pull ''Lowestoffe'' off, but not before she had sustained extensive damage. She had contributed a landing party to the assault on the fort and in all lost three men killed and five wounded.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 12040, 14 December 1779, pp.1-6.</ref> As a result of the battle the British ships captured two Spanish prizes with a cargo of bullion worth in excess of $3,000,000.<ref name="Goodwin60">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships|page=60}}</ref> ''Lowestoffe'' and ''Pomona'' also shared in the prize money for the ''St. Domingo'' and her cargo, which included 124 serons (crates) of indigo.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 12314, 16 July 1782, p.3.</ref>

On 26 March 1780 ''Lowestoffe'' captured the small sloop ''Fortune'', of 25 tons, off Cape Francois. Under the command of William Nevill, she had a crew of three and was sailing from North Carolina to Cape Francois with provisions.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 12104, 25 July 1780, p.5.</ref> Also in early 1800 ''Lowestoffe'' captured the Danish brig ''Diana'', which was sailing from St. Domingo to St. Thomas with a cargo of mahogany.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 15277, 19 July 1800, p.827.</ref> Then on 15 June ''Lowestoffe'', [[HMS Phoenix (1759)|''Phoenix'']] and ''Pomona'' captured the brig ''Delaware'', William Collins, Master. She was of 120 tons, armed with guns and had a crew of 53 men. She was sailing from Philadelphia to Port au Prince, with a cargo of flour and fish.<ref name=LG12199>''London Gazette'', Issue 12199, 16 June 1781, pp.2-4.</ref> Later ''Lowestoffe'' detained a Danish schooner sailing Acuba to [[Jacmel|Jacquemel]] with a cargo of cattle.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 15295, 20 September 1800, p.1083.</ref>

On 26 September ''Lowestoffe'' and [[HMS Pallas (1757)|''Pallas'']] captured two small vessels. One was the sloop ''Fair Henrietta'', of 70 tons, sailing from Philadelphia to Cape Francois with a load of lumber and bricks. The second was the brig ''St. Salvadore'', with a crew of 13 men, sailing from New Orleans to Havana with a cargo of lumber.<ref name=LG12199/> In late 1800 or early 1801 ''Lowestoffe'' captured a Spanish brig (name unknown) of 110 Tons, laden
with sugar and staves.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 15365, 12 May 1801, p.534.</ref>

Between 2 and 4 October ''Lowestoffe'' survived a hurricane that badly damaged numerous British warships.  The hurricane also caused [[HMS Barbadoes (1778)|''Barbadoes'']], [[HMS Scarborough (1756)|''Scarborough'']] and [[HMS Victor (1777)|''Victor'']] to founder, i.e., to be lost at sea with all hands.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 12149, 30 December 1780, p.4.</ref>

Captain Christopher Parker transferred into [[HMS Diamond (1774)|''Diamond'']] on 1 November 1780, Captain James Cornwallis briefly to replace him on ''Lowestoffe''.<ref name="Goodwin60"/> Cornwallis requested and received a transfer to {{HMS|Badger|1777|6}} five weeks later.  His successor was Captain Thomas Haynes. Under Haynes, ''Lowestoffe'' and [[HMS Janus (1778)|''Janus'']] captured the sloop ''Dispatch'', Giles Sagg, Master, on 18 January 1781, off [[Inagua|Heneauge]]. She was 60 tons, and carried four guns and a crew of 14 men. She was on her way from Port au Prince to Philadelphia with a cargo of coffee and sugar.<ref name=LG12199/>

Haynes left in May 1781 to take over the 64-gun [[Third-rate|Third Rate]] [[HMS Ruby (1776)|''Ruby'']].<ref name="Winfield190"/> Her next captain was George Stoney, with Captain Thomas Windsor replacing him on 31 January 1782. Windsor sailed ''Lowestoffe'' home and paid her off at [[Portsmouth]].<ref name="Winfield190"/> She was laid up there for nine months, before being moved to the [[River Thames]].<ref name="Goodwin60"/>

===The years of peace===
Robert Batson, of [[Limehouse]] carried out a great repair on ''Lowestoffe'' between July 1783 and March 1786. She returned to service in the [[English Channel]] in October 1787 under Captain Edmund Dodd.<ref name="Winfield190"/><ref name="Goodwin60"/> She sailed to the Mediterranean in May 1788, before returning to Britain where Captain [[Robert Stopford (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Stopford]] briefly took command in November 1790. ''Lowestoffe'' was paid off later that year and was fitted out at [[Plymouth]] between July 1792 and January 1793.<ref name="Winfield190"/><ref name="Goodwin60"/> ''Lowestoffe'' was then recommissioned in December 1792 under Captain William Wolseley.<ref name="Winfield190"/><ref name="Goodwin60"/>

===French Revolutionary War===
Wolseley sailed to the Mediterranean in May 1793, joining [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Hood's]] fleet then blockading [[Toulon]].<ref name="Winfield191">{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=British Warships of the Age of Sail |page=191}}</ref><ref name="Goodwin61">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=61}}</ref> She joined a flying squadron under Commodore Robert Linzee to act against French forces in the Mediterranean. On 30 September 1793, Commodore Robert Linzee took his squadron, including ''Lowestoffe'', into the Gulf of San Fiorenzo to attack the  redoubt of Forneilli on [[Corsica]].  ''Lowestoffe'' fired two broadsides at a tower at Mortella Point that protected the deep entrance to the gulf.  The fire caused the tower's French defenders to abandon the tower and its three guns, allowing a landing party from '' Lowestoffe'' under the command of Lieutenants Francis Annesley and John Gibb to capture the tower.<ref name="Goodwin61"/> Linzee, however, delayed his assault on the city until he could bring his larger ships into action. These larger ships bombarded the town from 1 October, but sustained considerable damage from the garrison, which forced Linzee to withdraw.<ref name="Goodwin61"/>{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}

''Lowestoffe'' remained in the area, supporting British operations against the French garrisons on Corsica during 1794. On 7 March 1794 Captain [[Charles Cunningham]] took over command from Wolsely. A little over a month later, on 13 April ''Lowestoffe'' captured the ''Etoile du Nord''.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 15225, 25 January 1800, p.85.</ref> {{HMS|Dido|1784|6}}, [[HMS Aimable (1782)|''Aimable'']] and [[HMS Imperieuse (1793)|''Imperieuse'']] shared in the capture.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 15228, 4 February 1800, p.110.</ref> ''Lowestoffe'' then was among the British warships that shared in the capture, on 24 May, of the French brigs ''Jacobin'' and ''Natine''.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 13911, 12 July 1796, p.675.</ref>

Captain [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]] replaced Cunningham on 12 August. Hallowell commanded ''Lowestoffe'' during the [[Naval Battle of Genoa (1795)|Naval Battle of Genoa]] on 14 March 1795, during which she received some damage from long range shots from the French fleet.<ref name="Goodwin61"/>  Captain [[Robert Gambier Middleton]] replaced Hallowell in June 1795.<ref name="Winfield191"/> 

====''Dido'' and ''Lowestoffe'' defeat ''Minerve'' and ''Art<U+00E9>mise''====
Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|Hotham]] then sent ''Lowestoffe'', and the 28-gun ''Dido'' under Captain [[George Henry Towry]] to reconnoitre the French fleet at Toulon.<ref name="Goodwin62">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=62}}</ref> While off [[Minorca]] on 24 June 1795 the two frigates encountered two French frigates, the 42-gun [[French frigate Minerve (1794)|''Minerve'']] and the 36-gun [[French frigate Art<U+00E9>mise (1794)|''Art<U+00E9>mise'']].<ref name=LG13801>''London Gazette'', Issue 13801, 1 August 179, pp.804-5.</ref><ref name="Goodwin62"/> The French were initially wary, but when they realised that they were larger and stronger than the British vessels, the French captains manoeuvred to attack.<ref name="Goodwin62"/> ''Minerve'' attempted to run down ''Dido'' but when ''Dido'' turned to avoid the impact ''Minerve''{{'}}s bowsprit became entangled in ''Dido''{{'}}s rigging, costing ''Dido'' her mizzenmast and colours.<ref name="Goodwin62"/> ''Lowestoffe'' came along the port side of the Frenchman to discharge a broadside that carried away ''Minerve''{{'}}s foremast and topmasts, crippling her.<ref name="Goodwin62"/> ''Lowestoffe'' pursued the retreating [[French frigate Art<U+00E9>mise (1794)|''Art<U+00E9>mise'']], which eventually escaped. ''Lowestoffe'' returned to ''Minerve'', firing on her until she struck. ''Lowestoffe'' had three men wounded, the ''Dido'' six killed and 15 wounded.<ref name=LG13801/><ref name="Goodwin62"/> ''Minerve'' lost about 10 percent of her crew of over 300 men.  The British took ''Minerve'' into service as the 38-gun frigate HMS ''Minerve''.  The weight of ''Minerve''{{'}}s broadside alone was greater than that of the two British frigates together, making the battle a notable victory; the [[Royal Navy]] duly awarded the two captains a [[Naval Gold Medal]] each.<ref>W.H. Long. 1805. ''Medals of the British Navy and How They were Won''. (London: Norrie and Wilson), pp. 79-81.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Navy List|author=Royal Navy|publisher=H.M.

==Later service==
Captain [[Robert Plampin]] relieved Middleton in December 1795, going on to serve with a squadron under [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]].<ref name="Winfield191"/><ref name="Goodwin63">{{cite book |last=Goodwin |title=Nelson's Ships |page=63}}</ref> After a refit in Britain, ''Lowestoffe'' escorted convoys in the West Indies. 

On 14 September 1796 she captured the ''Lesou''.<ref>''London Gazette'', Issue 15101, 22 January 1799, p.84.</ref> ''Lowestoffe'' was also among the vessels that in late 1799 captured the Spanish [[Letter of Marque]] ''Navarra'' (alias ''Diligent''). ''Diligent'' was of 150 tons and was armed with eight guns. She was sailing from Bilboa to [[Veracruz]] with a cargo of wine, iron and writing paper.<ref name=LG15222>''London Gazette'', Issue 15222, 14 January 1800, p.46-7.</ref> ''Lowestoffe'' also shared in the capture of the Spanish "zartan" ''Ambrosia'', which was sailing from Cadiz for Veracruz with a cargo of 26.5 tons of [[quicksilver]] and 10 tons of writing paper.<ref name=LG15222/> ''Lowestoffe'' alone captured the Spanish brig ''San Francisco'', of 90 tons, sailing from [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeachy]] to Havana with a cargo of sugar and logwood.<ref name=LG15222/>

==Loss==

''Lowestoffe'' sailed from [[Kingston, Jamaica]] on 22 July 1801, and met a convoy five days later at Port Antonio. The escorts consisted of ''Lowestoffe'', [[HMS Acasta (1797)|''Acasta'']], the sloop [[HMS Bonetta (1797)|''Bonetta'']], and the schooners [[HMS Muskito (1799)|''Muskito'']] and [[HMS Pickle (1800)|''Sting'']].

While working through the [[Caicos]] passage late on 10 August Pamplin realised that the strong currents known to run through the channel had reversed direction, and ''Lowestoffe'' was running into shallow waters. Attempts were made to haul off the shore but to no avail, and the ''Lowestoffe'' ran broadside onto the breakers on Little [[Inagua]] (<U+201C>Heneaga<U+201D>) Island.<ref name="Colledge"/><ref name="Goodwin63"/> The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to lighten the ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to try to pull her off, but this failing, the crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized in the surf.<ref name="Winfield191"/><ref name="Goodwin63"/> The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen.<ref name="Goodwin63"/> In the late afternoon of 11 August ''Acasta'' left ''Bonetta'' and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.<ref>Grocott (1997), p.114.</ref>

The subsequent [[court-martial]] at [[Port Royal]] on 3 September, recognized that the cause was a sudden change in the current after dark. It recognized that Pamplin had sailed in a judicious manner and exonerated Pamplin and his officers of blame, either for the loss of ''Lowestoffe'' or the vessels in convoy.<ref>''Naval Chronicle'', (1801), Vol. 6, p.422</ref>

In April 1803 the officers and crew of ''Lowestoffe'' and of ''Bonetta'' received payment for the salvage of the specie that ''Lowestoffe'' was carrying.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15580 |startpage=515 |date=30 April 1803|accessdate= 18 October 2010}}</ref>

'''a.''' {{Note_label|A|a|none}} On 7 February 1794, two British warships, the 74-gun {{HMS|Fortitude|1780|6}} and the 32-gun {{HMS|Juno|1780|6}}, unsuccessfully attacked the tower; the tower eventually fell to land-based forces under [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]] after two days of heavy fighting.
