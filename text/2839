'''Farm to Market Road&nbsp;1938''' ('''FM&nbsp;1938''') is a [[Farm to Market Road]] in the US state of [[Texas]]. The highway runs from [[Texas State Highway 26|State Highway&nbsp;26]] (SH&nbsp;26) to [[Farm to Market Road 1709|FM&nbsp;1709]], in [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]]. While located in [[Westlake, Texas|Westlake]], FM&nbsp;1938 is named Precinct Line Road. While located in [[Southlake, Texas|Southlake]], from the northern border of Southlake to its junction with FM&nbsp;1709, FM&nbsp;1938 is named Randol Mill Avenue, and from the FM&nbsp;1709 intersection to its southern terminus, the highway is named Davis Boulevard. FM&nbsp;1938 was designated in 1952, in [[Hockley County, Texas|Hockley County]], but was cancelled and redesignated in 1955, at its modern location in [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant County]]. In 1995, the entire route of FM 1938 was redesignated as '''Urban Road 1938''' ('''UR 1938''') by the [[Texas Department of Transportation]] (TxDOT). FM 1938 passes through central North Richland Hills and Southlake, providing access to several businesses. As of 2012, FM 1938 is in the process of being extended from an intersection with FM&nbsp;1709 to the north frontage road of SH&nbsp;114.

FM&nbsp;1938 (Davis Boulevard) begins at its southern terminus with SH&nbsp;26, directly besides the raised [[Interstate&nbsp;820]] (I-820) freeway. FM&nbsp;1938 continues on for about {{convert|0.2|mi|km}} before two exit ramps coming from I-820 merge with it, giving incomplete access to the freeway. The highway proceeds as a paved, asphalt, six-lane highway, with a [[center left-turn lane]] dividing it. The road continues through "downtown North Richland Hills", passing several small businesses and large residential neighborhoods. Along this stretch, FM&nbsp;1938 is traveling due north.<ref name="Map 452">{{Texas Mapbook|452|acccessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref> After an intersection with Smithfield Road, the highway turns in a northeastern direction and heads that way. It continues through North Richland Hills, intersecting with several large roads and passing a set of railroad tracks. The highway heads north for about 5.5&nbsp;miles before intersecting with [[Farm to Market road 3029|FM 3029]] and entering the city of [[Keller, Texas|Keller]]. The highway proceeds through Keller, passing several small businesses and large neighborhoods. FM&nbsp;1938 passes through Keller for about {{convert/spell|1|mi|km}} before passing over a small creek and entering the city of [[Southlake, Texas|Southlake]].<ref name="Map 451">{{Texas Mapbook|451|acccessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref> Just after entering Southlake, the highway passes a large landscaping and stone supplies facility.
