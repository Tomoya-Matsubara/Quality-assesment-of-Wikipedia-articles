The First Executive ([[1 July ]], [[1998]]<U+2013>[[14 October]], [[2002]]) was under the terms of the [[Northern Ireland Act 1998]] a [[Consociationalism|power sharing coalition]].

Following the [[Northern Ireland Assembly election, 1998|first election]] to the new Northern Ireland Assembly the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] and [[Sinn F<U+00E9>in]] all took up their ministerial posts and formed an executive, the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] refused to attend meetings of the Executive Committee in protest at Sinn F<U+00E9>in's participation. 

Full power was devolved to the Executive on [[2 December]], [[1999]], this power was revoked by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland|Secretary of State]] on four separate occasions, the first was for a period of 3 months from [[11 February]], [[2000]]<U+2013>[[30 May]], [[2000]] because of no arms decommissioning the next two times where for periods of 24 hours on [[10 August]], [[2001]] to help deal with arms negotiations and [[21 September]], [[2001]] following the [[Holy Cross dispute]]. The final suspension came on [[14 October]], [[2002]] after the [[Stormontgate]] controversy surrounding an alleged [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] spy ring based in [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]].
