Although the majority of The Beatles' songs were written by [[Lennon and McCartney]], Harrison generally wrote one song per side from the ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]'' album onwards.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/01/11/harrison-lyrics-auction.html Handwritten Harrison Beatles lyrics up for auction], CBC Arts, 11 January 2007.

After the band's breakup, Harrison continued writing, releasing the acclaimed and successful triple album, ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', in 1970, from which came the #1 single  "[[My Sweet Lord]]". In addition to his solo work, Harrison co-wrote two hits for [[Ringo Starr]], another ex-Beatle, as well as songs for the Traveling Wilburys <U+2014> the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] he formed in 1988 with [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Jeff Lynne]] and [[Roy Orbison]].

Harrison embraced [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] and [[Hinduism]] in the 1960s, and helped expand Western awareness of [[sitar]] music and of the [[Hare Krishna movement]]. With [[Ravi Shankar]] he organised a major charity concert with the 1971 ''[[Concert for Bangladesh]]'', and is the only Beatle to have published an autobiography, with ''I Me Mine'' in 1980.

Besides being a musician, he was also a record producer and co-founder of the [[production company]] [[Handmade Films]]. In his work as a film producer, he collaborated with people as diverse as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and the members of [[Monty Python]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.handmadeplc.com/|title=HandMade PLC|publisher=www.handmadeplc.com|accessdate=2008-10-30|last=|first=}}</ref> His interests included gardening and  motor racing.

He had a close friendship with [[Eric Clapton]]. He died of cancer in 2001.

Harrison was very popular with the girls, getting an estimated 30,000 gifts and cards for his 21st birthday.

The popularity of The Beatles led to a successful tour of America, the making of a film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (during which Harrison met his future wife [[Pattie Boyd]]), and being awarded the [[MBE]].

===Guitar work===
Harrison's guitar work with The Beatles was varied, flexible and occasionally innovative; though not fast or flashy, his guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 60s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acousticguitar.com/issues/ag122/feature122.html

During The Beatles' first trip to the U.S., in February 1964, Harrison acquired a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] guitar. He had tried out the 12-string electric guitar during an interview with a Minneapolis radio station, and was given the guitar either by the [[Rickenbacker]] company or the radio station.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=NlscjoFVcs0C ''The History of Rickenbacker Guitars''], pp 77-79, Richard R. Smith, Centerstream Publications, 1988, ISBN 0931759153</ref> The 360/12 was an experimental [[12-string]] guitar with the strings reversed so that the lower pitched string was struck first, and with an unusual [[headstock]] design that made tuning easier.<ref name="Beatles Gear">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zQ-5ZpoMn1AC&pg=PA112&dq=Rickenbacker+360/12+harrison&client=firefox-a#PPA110,M1 ''Beatles Gear: All the Fab Four's Instruments, from Stage to Studio''], pp 110-112, Andy Babiuk, Mark Lewisohn, Tony Bacon, Backbeat Books, 2002, ISBN 0879307315</ref> Harrison used the guitar extensively during the recording of ''[[A Hard Day's Night]]'', and the [[Jangle pop|jangle sound]] became so popular that the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' termed it "the beat boys' secret weapon".<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zQ-5ZpoMn1AC&client=firefox-a ''Beatles Gear: All the Fab Four's Instruments, from Stage to Studio''], page 120, Andy Babiuk, Mark Lewisohn, Tony Bacon, Backbeat Books, 2002, ISBN 0879307315</ref>  [[Roger McGuinn]] liked the effect Harrison achieved so much that it became his signature guitar sound with [[the Byrds]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MiAUF0ea64UC&pg=PT15&dq=Rickenbacker+360/12+beatles+tracks&client=firefox-a ''Christie's Rock and Pop Memorabilia''], page 82, Peter Doggett, Sarah Hodgson, Pavilion, 2003, ISBN 1862055386</ref>

He got his first [[Fender Stratocaster]] in 1965 and used it for the recording of the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album, most notably on the "[[Nowhere Man]]" track, where he played in unison with Lennon who also had a Stratocaster.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EeEctAKFUWAC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=Fender+Stratocaster+george+harrison+Don+Randall&source=web&ots=QUvGEfC0ww&sig=iJwPh_fH864oBPXL6f-LbL2GTNI&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result ''The Fender Stratocaster''], page 22, A.

===Song writing and singing===
{{main|List of George Harrison songs}}
[[File:The Beatles album cover.jpg|thumb|[[The White Album]] contains four of Harrison's compositions]] 
Harrison wrote his first song, "[[Don't Bother Me]]", while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963,<ref name="Don'tBotherMe">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.beatlesbible.com/songs/dont-bother-me/  |title=Don't Bother Me  |publisher=Beatles Bible |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> as an exercise "to see if I could write a song", as he remembered.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UmrVa2U7jB0C&pg=PA193&dq=Don%27t+Bother+Me+George+Harrison&client=firefox-a ''The Beatles as Musicians''], page 193, Walter Everett, Oxford University Press US, 2001, ISBN 0195141059</ref> "Don't Bother Me" appeared on the second Beatles album (''[[With the Beatles]]'') later that year, then on ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' in the U.S. in early 1964, and also briefly in the film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. The group did not record another Harrison composition until 1965, when he contributed "[[I Need You (The Beatles song)|I Need You]]" and "[[You Like Me Too Much]]" to the album ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]''.

Harrison's songwriting improved greatly through the years, but his material did not earn respect from his fellow Beatles until near the group's breakup. McCartney told Lennon in 1969: "George's songs this year are at least as good as ours".<ref>''Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now'', page 554, Barry Miles, Henry Holt and Co., 1998, ISBN 0805052496</ref><ref>''John Lennon: One Day at a Time : a Personal Biography of the Seventies'', page 96, Anthony Fawcett, New English Library, 20 Jan 1977, ISBN 0450030733</ref> Harrison had difficulty getting the band to record his songs.<ref>''Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends who Changed Music Forever'', page 174, Scott Schinder, Greenwood Press, 2008, ISBN 0313338469</ref><ref>''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Revised and Updated for the 21st Century'', page 413, Holly George-Warren, Patricia Romanowski, Patricia Romanowski Bashe, Jon Pareles, Fireside, 2001, ISBN 0743201205</ref>

Harrison performed the lead vocal on all Beatles songs that he wrote by himself. He also sang lead vocal on other songs, including "[[Chains (song)|Chains]]" and "[[Do You Want to Know a Secret]]" on ''[[Please Please Me]]'', "[[Roll Over Beethoven]]" and "[[Devil in Her Heart]]" on ''[[With the Beatles]]'', "[[I'm Happy Just to Dance with You]]" on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', and "[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]" on ''[[Beatles for Sale]]''.

==Solo recordings: 1968<U+2013>1989==
Before The Beatles split up in 1970 Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' and ''[[Electronic Sound]]''. These albums, however, were mainly instrumental. ''Wonderwall Music'' was a soundtrack to the ''[[Wonderwall]]'' film in which Harrison blended Indian and Western sounds;<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA182&dq=Wonderwall+Music&client=firefox-a ''The Dawn of Indian Music in the West''], page 182, Peter Lavezzoli, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0826418155</ref> while ''Electronic Sound'' was an experiment in using a [[Moog synthesizer|Moog synthesiser]].<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bgn9SGmA4dkC&pg=PA508&dq=electronic+sound+george+harrison&client=firefox-a ''All Music Guide to Rock''], page 508, Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Backbeat Books, 2002, ISBN 087930653X</ref> It was only when Harrison was free from The Beatles that he released what is regarded as his first "real" solo album, the commercially successful and critically acclaimed ''[[#All Things Must Pass|All Things Must Pass]]''.<ref name="Boys">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iJ0OAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA155&dq=george+harrison+Solo+career&client=firefox-a ''The Boys from Liverpool''], page 155, Nicholas Schaffner, Taylor & Francis, 1980, ISBN 0416306616</ref>

===All Things Must Pass===
{{Main|All Things Must Pass}}
After years of being restricted in his song-writing contributions to The Beatles, ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' contained such a large outpouring of Harrison's songs that it was released as a [[triple album]],<ref name="Boys"/> though only two of the discs contained songs - the third contained recordings of Harrison [[Jam session|jamming]] with friends.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w-BfIUwuBEcC&pg=PA508&dq=All+Things+Must+Pass+jamming&client=firefox-a ''All Music Guide to Rock''], page 508, Vladimir Bogdanov, Chris Woodstra, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Backbeat Books, 2002, ISBN 087930653X</ref> <ref name="Sonic">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y4Sk0FNXkjcC&pg=PA36&dq=All+Things+Must+Pass+harrison+success&lr=&client=firefox-a#PPA37,M1 ''Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings''], pp 36 - 37, David N.

The album was co-produced by [[Phil Spector]], and the musicians included [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Mason]], [[Billy Preston]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref name="Sonic"/>

Harrison was later sued for [[copyright infringement]] over the single "My Sweet Lord" because of its similarity to the 1963 [[The Chiffons|Chiffons]] single "[[He's So Fine]]", owned by Bright Tunes. Harrison denied deliberately stealing the song, but he lost the resulting court case in 1976 as the judge accepted that Harrison had "subconsciously" plagiarised "He's So Fine". When considering liable earnings, "My Sweet Lord"'s contribution to the sales of ''All Things Must Pass'' and ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' were taken into account, and the judge decided a figure of $1,599,987 was owed to Bright Tunes.<ref name="Plagiarism">[http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/mysweet.htm The "My Sweet Lord"/"He's So Fine" Plagiarism Suit ], Joseph C. Self, The 910, 1993. Retrieved 13 December 2008</ref> The dispute over damages became complicated when Harrison's manager [[Allen Klein]] changed sides by buying Bright Tunes and then continuing the suit against Harrison. In 1981, a district judge decided that Klein had acted improperly, and it was agreed that Harrison should pay Klein $587,000, the amount Klein had paid for Bright Tunes - so he would gain nothing from the deal, and that Harrison would take over ownership of Bright Tunes, making him the owner of the rights to both "My Sweet Lord" and "He's So Fine" and thus ending the copyright infringement claim. Though the dispute dragged on into the 1990s, the district judge's decision was upheld.<ref name="Plagiarism"/><ref name="huntley">{{cite book |last=Huntley |first=Elliot J |year=2004 |title=Mystical One: George Harrison: After the Breakup of the Beatles |publisher=Guernica Editions Inc. |isbn=1-55071-197-0}}</ref>

===1970<U+2013>1980===
Harrison would not again release an album that came close to the critical and commercial achievements of ''All Things Must Pass''.  Although 1973's ''[[Living in the Material World]]'' initially did well, holding #1 on the U.S. album chart for 5 weeks, and the album's single, "[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]",  was also  successful reaching #1 in the U.S., neither could match the sales of ''All Things Must Pass'' and "My Sweet Lord". The ''[[Dark Horse (album)|Dark Horse]]'' album of 1974, which was accompanied by a tour of North America,  made the Top 5 in the U.S. album chart, but failed to chart in the UK. The song "[[Dark Horse (song)|Dark Horse]]" was released as the second single and reached #15 on Billboard.<ref>

His final studio album for EMI (and Apple Records) was ''[[Extra Texture (Read All About It)]]'', featuring a [[diecutting|diecut]] cover. The album spawned two singles, "[[You (George Harrison song)|You]]" which reached the Billboard top 20 and "[[This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying)]]", which became Apple's final original single release in 1975. <ref>(Schaffner 1977)</ref> It was also the first solo Beatles single that failed to chart in the U.S. Following the former Beatle's departure from Capitol, the record company was in a position to licence releases featuring Beatles and post-Beatles work on the same album, using Harrison for this experiment. ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' (1976) combined his Beatles songs with a selection of his solo Apple work.

''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' his first Dark Horse release, was his most successful late-1970s album, reaching #11 on the U.S. charts in 1976, and producing the singles "[[This Song]]" (a satire of the "[[My Sweet Lord]]"-"[[He's So Fine]]" court case ruling) and "[[Crackerbox Palace]]". However, he could not finish the production work as he was suffering from [[hepatitis]].<ref name="greene">{{cite web |last=Green |first=Joshua |title=Yoga and the Quiet Beatle |url=http://herecomesthesunbook.blogspot.com/2006/02/yoga-and-quiet-beatle.html |accessdate=2007-05-08}}</ref> After his second marriage and the birth of son [[Dhani Harrison]], Harrison's next released a self-titled album. 1979's ''[[George Harrison (album)|George Harrison]]'' included the singles "[[Blow Away]]", "[[Love Comes to Everyone]]" and "[[Faster (George Harrison song)|Faster]]". Both the album and "Blow Away" made the Billboard top 20.

On 23 November 1971, Harrison appeared on an episode of ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' in a band called Wonder Wheel performing a song written by [[Gary Wright]] called "Two Faced Man". George Harrison played slide guitar in this band as a favour since Wright had played piano on Harrison's album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''. The episode can be viewed on DVD "The [[Dick Cavett]] Show: Rock Icons: Disc 3".<ref name="BiographyGaryWright">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/music/artists/gary_wright/  |title=Biography: Gary Wright |publisher=Absolute Radio |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>

In addition to his own works during this time, Harrison co-wrote or produced two hits for Starr ("[[It Don't Come Easy]]" and "[[Photograph (Ringo Starr song)|Photograph]]") and appeared on tracks by Lennon "[[How Do You Sleep?]]", "[[Oh My Love]]" and "[[Gimme Some Truth]]", [[Harry Nilsson]] ("You're Breakin' My Heart"), [[Badfinger]] ("Day After Day") on which he played slide guitar, as well as working with [[Billy Preston]] ("[[That's the Way God Planned It]]", 1969 and "[[It's My Pleasure]]", 1975) and [[Cheech & Chong]] ("[[Basketball Jones]]").

===1980<U+2013>1989===
Harrison was deeply shocked by the December 1980 [[Death of John Lennon|murder of John Lennon]]. The crime reinforced his decades-long worries about safety from [[stalking|stalkers]]. It was also a deep personal loss, although unlike former bandmates McCartney and Starr, Harrison had little contact with Lennon in the years before the murder. Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon. "[[All Those Years Ago (song)|All Those Years Ago]]" received substantial radio airplay, reaching #2 on the U.S. charts.<ref name="AllThoseYearsAgo">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.connollyco.com/discography/george_harrison/allthose7.html |title=All Those Years Ago |publisher=Connolly and Company |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref> All three remaining Beatles performed on it, although it was expressly a Harrison single. "Teardrops" was issued as a follow-up single, but was not nearly as successful. Both singles came from the album ''[[Somewhere in England]]'', released in 1981. Originally slated for release in late 1980, [[Warner Bros.]] rejected the album, ordering Harrison to replace several tracks, and to change the album cover as well. The original album cover that Harrison wanted was used in the 2004 reissue of the album. In 1981, Harrison played guitar on one track of [[Mick Fleetwood]]'s record ''The Visitor'' and [[Lindsey Buckingham]]'s song "Walk a Thin Line".

Aside from a song on the ''[[Porky's Revenge]]'' soundtrack in 1984 (his version of a little-known [[Bob Dylan]] song "I Don't Want To Do It"), Harrison released no new records for five years after 1982's ''[[Gone Troppo]]'' received apparent indifference. In 1985, Harrison made a rare public appearance on the [[Showtime]] special ''[[Carl Perkins]] and Friends'' along with Starr and Clapton among others. He only agreed to appear because he was a close admirer of Perkins.

In 1987 Harrison returned with the critically acclaimed platinum album ''[[Cloud Nine (George Harrison album)|Cloud Nine]]'', co-produced with [[Jeff Lynne]] of [[Electric Light Orchestra]], and enjoyed a hit (#1 in the U.S.; #2 in the UK) when his rendition of [[James Ray (singer)|James Ray]]'s early 1960s number "[[Got My Mind Set on You]]" was released as a single; another single, "[[When We Was Fab]]", a retrospective of The Beatles' days complete with musical flavours for each bandmate, was also a minor hit. [[MTV]] regularly played the two videos, and elevated Harrison's public profile with another generation of music listeners. The album reached #8 and #10 on the U.S. and UK charts, respectively. In the U.S., several tracks also enjoyed high placement on Billboard's Album Rock chart - "Devil's Radio," "[[This Is Love (George Harrison song)|This Is Love]]" and "Cloud 9" in addition to the aforementioned singles.

Early in 1989, Harrison, Lynne and ex-Beatle Ringo Starr all appeared on [[Tom Petty]]'s "I Won't Back Down" music video, although Starr did not actually play on the track;<ref>[[Tom Petty]]</ref> Harrison played acoustic guitar. The same year also saw the release of ''[[Best of Dark Horse 1976<U+2013>1989]]'', a compilation drawn from his later solo work. This album also included two new songs, "Poor Little Girl", and "Cockamamie Business" (which saw him once again looking wryly upon his Beatle past), as well as "[[Cheer Down]]", which had first been released earlier in the year on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', which starred [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Danny Glover]]. Unlike his previous greatest hits package, Harrison made sure to oversee this compilation. In 1989 Harrison played slide guitar on the "[[Leave a Light On]]" song from [[Belinda Carlisle]]'s third album "[[Runaway Horses]]". The song was a commercial success worldwide.

==The Traveling Wilburys: 1988<U+2013>1990==
{{main|Traveling Wilburys}}
In 1988, Harrison played an instrumental role in forming the Traveling Wilburys with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Tom Petty]] when they gathered in Dylan's garage to quickly record an additional track for a projected Harrison European single release.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=vXh8cN6ZM2sC&pg=RA1-PA129&lpg=RA1-PA129&dq=Traveling+Wilburys+dylan%27s+garage&source=web&ots=LiDsNO0cim&sig=DyJkk7XUbTrNkqLzay8dXYvzjvQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result#PRA1-PA130,M1 ''Bob Dylan: Performing Artist 1986<U+2013>1990 & Beyond : Mind Out of Time''] pp129-138, Paul Williams, Omnibus Press, 2004, ISBN 1844492818. retrieved 13 December 2008</ref>  The record company realised the track ("[[Handle With Care (song)|Handle With Care]]") was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full, separate album. This had to be completed within two weeks, as Dylan was scheduled to start a tour. The album, ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1]]'', was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers (supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.). Harrison's pseudonym on the first album was "Nelson Wilbury"; he would use the name "Spike Wilbury" for the Traveling Wilburys' second album.

After the death of Roy Orbison in late 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece. There is speculation the band approached [[Del Shannon]] to fill the vacant slot; however, this rumour has not been confirmed or denied by the surviving members.<ref>[http://www.delshannon.com/delbio.htm Del Shannon Biography], Del Shannon Enterprises, Inc., 2007. Retrieved 13 December 2008 </ref>  Though ''[[Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3]]'' was their second release, the album was mischievously titled ''Vol. 3'' by Harrison.  According to Lynne, "That was George's idea.  He said, 'Let's confuse the buggers.' " <ref>Hurwitz, Matt. "Wilburys set to travel again" ''USA Today'' 11 June 2007</ref>  It was not as well received as the previous album, but did reach #14 in the UK and #11 in the US where it went platinum, while the singles "[[She's My Baby]]", "Inside Out", and "[[Wilbury Twist]]" got decent air play.

==Live performances==

Harrison launched a major tour of the United States in 1974. Critical and fan reaction panned the tour for its long mid-concert act of Pandit Ravi Shankar & Friends and for Harrison's hoarse voice.
Harrison had hired filmmaker [[David Acomba]] to accompany the tour and gather footage for a documentary. Due to Harrison's hoarse voice throughout most of this tour, the film was not released, but in 2007 Acomba placed a newly revised director's cut in the Harrison archive.

In 1986, Harrison made a surprise performance at "Heartbeat '86", a concert event to raise money for the [[Birmingham Children's Hospital]]. Harrison played and sang the finale "[[Johnny B. Goode]]" along with [[Robert Plant]], [[The Moody Blues]], and [[Electric Light Orchestra]], among others.<ref name="ShadowsoftheLight ">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.rockaria.com/history.html  |title=Shadows of the Light  |publisher=Rockaria  |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>

In 1991, Harrison staged a tour of Japan along with [[Eric Clapton]]. It was his first tour since the 1974 U.S. tour, but no other tours followed. The ''[[Live in Japan (George Harrison album)|Live in Japan]]'' recording came from these shows. In October 1992, Harrison played three songs ("[[If Not for You]]", "[[Absolutely Sweet Marie]]", and "[[My Back Pages]]") at a huge [[Bob Dylan]] tribute concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.<ref name="Bob DylanInductionYear">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/bob-dylan  |title=Bob Dylan: Induction Year: 1988 |publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>

===The Concert for Bangladesh===
{{Main|The Concert for Bangladesh}}
Harrison organised a major [[charity concert]], ''The Concert for Bangladesh'', with  [[Ravi Shankar (musician)|Ravi Shankar]] on 1 August 1971, drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="ConcertforBangladesh">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.concertforbangladesh.com/ |title=Concert for Bangladesh |publisher=Concertforbangladesh  |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> The aim of the event was to raise money to aid the starving refugees during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Ravi Shankar opened the proceedings, which included other popular musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]] (who rarely appeared live in the early 1970s), [[Eric Clapton]], who made his first public appearance in months (due to a [[Heroin|heroin addiction]] which began when [[Derek and the Dominos]] broke up), [[Leon Russell]], [[Badfinger]], [[Billy Preston]] and fellow Beatle [[Ringo Starr]]. Tax troubles and questionable expenses tied up many of the concert's proceeds.<ref name="ConcertforBangladesh"/> Apple Corporation released a newly arranged concert DVD and CD in October 2005 (with all artists' sales royalties continuing to go to [[UNICEF]]), which contained additional material such as previously unreleased rehearsal footage of "[[If Not for You]]", featuring Harrison and Dylan.

==The Beatles Anthology==
{{main|The Beatles Anthology}}
In 1994<U+2013>1996, Harrison reunited with the surviving former Beatles, and Traveling Wilburys producer Jeff Lynne for ''The Beatles Anthology'' project, which included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by John Lennon in the late 1970s, as well as the lengthy interviews on The Beatles' history.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eTkHAldi4bEC&pg=PA286&dq=The+Beatles+Anthology&lr=&client=firefox-a ''The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver Through the Anthology''], page 286, Walter Everett, Oxford University Press US, 1999, ISBN 0195129415</ref> The single "[[Free as a Bird]]", was the first Beatles single since "[[The Long and Winding Road]]" in 1970.<ref name="TimeFreeBird">{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Corliss |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,133480,00.html |title=Free as a Beatle |publisher=[[Time]] |date=2001-06-24|accessdate=2008-02-22}}</ref><ref name="RollingStoneBeatlesBiog">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeatles/biography |title=The Beatles<U+2019> biography |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref>

==Later life: 1990-2001==
In 1996, Harrison recorded, produced and played on "Distance Makes No Difference With Love" with [[Carl Perkins]] for his ''Go-Cat-Go'' record.

Harrison's final television appearance was not intended as such; in fact, he was not the featured artist, and the appearance had been intended to promote ''[[Chants of India]]'', another collaboration with Ravi Shankar released in 1997, at the height of interest in [[chant]] music. [[John Fugelsang]], then of [[VH1]], conducted the interview, and at one point an acoustic guitar was produced and handed to Harrison. When an audience member asked to hear "a Beatles song," Harrison pulled a sheepish look and answered, "I don't think I know any!" Harrison then played "All Things Must Pass" and "Any Road", a song which subsequently appeared on the 2002 ''Brainwashed'' album.

In January 1998, Harrison attended the funeral of his boyhood idol, [[Carl Perkins]], in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. Harrison played an impromptu version of Perkins' song "Your True Love" during the service.<ref name="ThoughtsonCarl">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/CarlPerkins.html |title=Thoughts on Carl: Carl's Funeral  |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> That same year he attended the public memorial service for [[Linda McCartney]]. Also that same year, he appeared on [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Vertical Man]]'', where he played both electric and slide guitars on two tracks.

In late 1999 Harrison survived a knife attack by an intruder in his home. On the evening of 30 December 1999, Michael Abram broke into the Harrisons' [[Friar Park]] home in [[Henley-on-Thames]] and stabbed George multiple times, ultimately puncturing his lung. Harrison and his wife, Olivia, fought the intruder and detained him for the police.<ref>

In 2001, Harrison performed as a guest musician on the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] album ''[[Zoom (album)|Zoom]]''. He played slide guitar on the song "Love Letters" for [[Bill Wyman]]'s Rhythm Kings, and remastered and restored unreleased tracks from the Traveling Wilburys. He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani, "[[Horse to the Water]]". The latter song ended up as Harrison's final recording session, on 2 October. It appeared on [[Jools Holland]]'s album ''[[Small World, Big Band]]''.<ref name="SmallWorldBigBand">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.joolsholland.com/smallworld.htm  |title=Small World Big Band  |publisher=Jools Holland |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref>

Harrison's final album, ''[[Brainwashed (album)|Brainwashed]]'', was completed by [[Dhani Harrison]] and [[Jeff Lynne]] and released on 18 November 2002. It received generally positive reviews in the United States, and peaked at #18 on the [[Billboard charts]]. A media-only single, "[[Stuck Inside a Cloud]]", was heavily played on UK and U.S. radio to promote the album (#27 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart), while the official single "[[Any Road]]", released in May 2003, reached #37 on the British chart. The instrumental track, "Marwa Blues" went on to receive the [[2004 Grammy Award]] for [[Best Pop Instrumental Performance]], while the single "Any Road" was nominated for [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]].<ref>

==Handmade Films==
{{main|Handmade Films}}
HandMade Films was formed in 1979 when Harrison and business partner [[Denis O'Brien (producer)|Denis O'Brien]] financed the [[Monty Python]] film ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' after [[EMI Films]], the original financiers, pulled out.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DxdBeANhYA8C&pg=PA310&dq=%22Life+of+Brian%22+george+harrison ''The Directors: Take Two''], page 310, Robert J. Emery, Allworth Communications, Inc., 2002, ISBN 1581152191</ref>

The first film started under the company was ''[[Time Bandits]]'' in 1981. Harrison produced twenty three films with Handmade including ''[[Mona Lisa (movie)|Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'', and ''[[Withnail and I]]''. He made several [[cameo appearance]]s in these movies, including appearing as a nightclub singer in ''[[Shanghai Surprise]]'' and as Mr Papadopolous in ''[[Life of Brian]]''.<ref>

==Interest in Indian culture==
===Sitar and Indian music===
During a Beatles American tour in 1965, Harrison's friend [[David Crosby]] of [[the Byrds]] introduced him to [[Indian classical music]] and the work of [[sitar]] maestro [[Ravi Shankar (musician)|Ravi Shankar]].<ref name="shankar_intro"/> Harrison became fascinated with the instrument, immersed himself in Indian music and played a pivotal role in expanding the emerging interest in the sitar in particular and [[Music of India|Indian music]] in general in the West.<ref name="Dawn">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA172&dq=george+harrison+Monterey+Pop+Festival&client=firefox-a ''The Dawn of Indian Music in the West''], page 172, Peter Lavezzoli, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, ISBN 0826418155</ref>

Buying a sitar himself as The Beatles came back from a Far East tour, he played one on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' track "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]", which was influential in the decision to have Ravi Shankar included on the bill at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in June 1967.<ref name="Dawn"/> After a few initial lessons with Pandit Ravi Shankar, Harrison was placed under the tutelage of Shambhu Das.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eTkHAldi4bEC&pg=PA71&dq=george+harrison+Shambu+Das&client=firefox-a ''The Beatles as Musicians: Revolver Through the Anthology''], page 71, Walter Everett, Oxford University Press US, 1999, ISBN 0195129415</ref>

===Hinduism===
[[File:George Harrison Vrindavan.jpg|thumb|George Harrison and Shyamasundara Dasa in [[Vrindavan]] in front of [[Jiva Goswami]] [[Samadhi]]]]
During the filming of the movie ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', on location in the [[Bahamas]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] devotee presented each Beatle with a book about [[reincarnation]]. Harrison's interest in Indian culture expanded to Hinduism. During a pilgrimage to [[Bombay, India]] with his wife, Harrison studied sitar, met several [[guru]]s and visited various holy places, filling the months between the end of the final Beatles tour in 1966 and the commencement of the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' recording sessions.

In the summer of 1969, he produced the single "[[Hare Krishna Mantra]]", performed by the devotees of the London [[Radha]] [[Krishna|Krsna]] Temple. That same year, he and fellow Beatle [[John Lennon]] met [[A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], founder - [[acharya]] of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON). Soon after, Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition (particularly [[Japa|''japa-yoga'']] chanting with beads), and he remained associated with it until his death.

While during his lifetime, Harrison bequeathed to ISKCON his [[Letchmore Heath]] mansion (renamed [http://chantandbehappy.com/manorvirtual/ Bhaktivedanta Manor]) north of London, some sources indicate he left nothing to the organisation,<ref name="Shawstar">{{cite web|url=http://www.shawstar.com/music/george_harrison.htm|title=George Harrison biography|publisher=Shawstar|language=English|accessdate=2008-12-04}}</ref> others report he did leave a sum of 20 million pounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/aa120501b.htm |title=George Harrison & Hinduism - His Idea of God & Reincarnation |publisher=Hinduism.about.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref>

==Friendship with Eric Clapton==
Harrison formed a close friendship with [[Eric Clapton]] in the late 1960s, and they co-wrote the song "[[Badge (song)|Badge]]," which was released on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'' album in 1969.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZjY3kg2umEQC&pg=PA34&dq=george+harrison+Badge&client=firefox-a ''The Music of George Harrison: While My Guitar Gently Weeps''], page 34, Simon Leng, SAF Publishing Ltd, 2003, ISBN 0946719500</ref> Harrison also played [[rhythm guitar]] on the song. For contractual reasons, Harrison was required to use the pseudonym "L'Angelo Misterioso", meaning "The Mysterious Angel" in Italian.<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qpvlUrpH_xoC&pg=PA32&dq=%22L%27Angelo+Misterioso%22&client=firefox-a#PPA33,M1 ], page 33, Marc Roberty, Chris Charlesworth, Omnibus Press, 1995, ISBN 0711943052</ref> Harrison wrote one of his compositions for The Beatles' ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' album, "[[Here Comes the Sun]]", in Clapton's back garden. Clapton also guested on the Harrison-penned Beatles track "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]". Through Clapton, Harrison met [[Delaney Bramlett]], who introduced Harrison to slide guitar.<ref name="rshof">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/george-harrison |title=George Harrison |publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |accessdate=2007-03-09}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:Harrison Birth Cert.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Certified copy of Harrison's birth certificate]]

Harrison married for a second time, to [[Dark Horse Records]] secretary [[Olivia Trinidad Arias]] on 2 September 1978. They had met at the Dark Horse offices in Los Angeles in 1974. They had one son, [[Dhani Harrison]]. After the 1999 stabbing incident in which Olivia subdued Harrison's assailant nearly single-handedly, Harrison received a fax from his close friend [[Tom Petty]] that read: "Aren't you glad you married a Mexican girl?"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/tompetty/articles/story/5919468/tom_petty_remembers_george |title=Tom Petty Remembers George: Tom Petty : Rolling Stone |publisher=Rollingstone.com |author=MIM UDOVITCH and DAVID WILDPosted 2 Jan 2002 12:00 AM |date=Posted 2 January 2002 12:00 AM |accessdate=2008-10-31}}</ref> 
[[File:Kinfauns1.jpg|thumb|left|Harrison's house, [[Kinfauns (Surrey)|Kinfauns]] in Surrey, that he shared with Pattie Boyd]]

Through his appreciation of Monty Python he met Python member [[Eric Idle]]. The two became close friends, with Harrison appearing on Idle's [[Rutland Weekend Television]] series and in his Beatles spoof, [[The Rutles]]' ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]''.<ref name="RutlandWeekendTelevision">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/rutlandweekendtelevision/index.shtml |title=Rutland Weekend Television |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-30}}</ref> Idle also performed at the Concert for George, held to commemorate Harrison.

An accomplished gardener, Harrison restored the English manor house and grounds of [[Friar Park]],<ref>[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BSZtZUWge-IC&pg=PA226&dq=george+harrison+gardening&client=firefox-a#PPA226,M1 ''Here Comes the Sun: The Spiritual and Musical Journey of George Harrison''], pp 226-227, Joshua M.

Harrison took great solace working in the garden, and his autobiography "I, Me, Mine" is dedicated "to gardeners everywhere".<ref name="mystical">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rcg50S6jLnoC&pg=PA170&dq=harrison+%22to+gardeners+everywhere%22&client=firefox-a ''Mystical One: George Harrison''], page 170, Elliot J. Huntley, Guernica Editions, 2004, ISBN 1550711970</ref>

The autobiography, ''[[I Me Mine]]'', published in 1980, is the only full autobiography by an ex-Beatle.<ref> An autobiographical sketch by John Lennon, titled after one of his songs, ''[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]'', was posthumously published in 1986 as part of his collection ''[[Skywriting by Word of Mouth]]''.</ref> Former Beatles' publicist [[Derek Taylor]] helped with the book, which was initially released in a high-priced limited edition by [[Genesis Publications]].<ref name="mystical"/> The book said little about The Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, such as gardening and [[Formula One]] automobile racing. It also included the lyrics to his songs and some photographs with humorous captions.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/0811837939 Amazon.com Reviews]</ref>

Harrison had an interest in [[sports car]]s and [[motor racing]]; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the [[McLaren F1]] road car,<ref name="Cars">[http://books.google.com/books?id=iJdgbE4emBcC&pg=PA127&dq=McLaren+F1+george+harrison#PPA127,M1 ''Cars of the Super Rich''], page 127, Martin Buckley, MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company, 2004, ISBN 0760319537</ref> and would often attend [[Formula One]] races. He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young; when he was 12 he attended his first race, the [[1955 British Grand Prix]] at [[Aintree_Racecourse#Motor_racing|Aintree]], in which [[Stirling Moss]] won his first Grand Prix.<ref name="Cars"/><ref>
