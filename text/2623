The '''Chinhoyi Caves''' are a group of [[cave]]s in [[Zimbabwe]].

==Location==
The caves are located in [[Makonde District]], [[Mashonaland West|Mashonaland West Province]], in central, northern Zimbabwe. They lie approximately {{convert|9|km|mi}}, by road, northwest of [[Chinhoyi]], the nearest large town, and the location of the district and provincial headquarters.<ref>[http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zimbabwe_Distance_Result.asp?%20fromplace=Sinoia%20Caves%20()&toplace=Chinhoyi%20()&fromlat=-17.35&tolat=-17.3666667&fromlng=30.1333333&tolng=30.2 Map Showing Chinhoyi And Chinhoyi Caves With Distance Marker]</ref> This location lies about {{convert|135|km|mi}}, northwest of Harare, the [[capital city|capital]] of Zimbabwe and the largest city in that country.<ref>[http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zimbabwe_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Sinoia%20Caves%20()%20&toplace=Harare%20(Harare)&fromlat=-17.35&tolat=-17.8177778&fromlng=30.1333333&tolng=31.0447222 Road Distance Between Harare And Chinhoyi Caves With Map]</ref> The caves lie on the main road, Highway A-1, between [[Harare]] and [[Chirundu, Zimbabwe|Chirundu]], at the International border with the [[Republic of Zambia]], about {{convert|250|km|mi}}, further northwest of the caves.<ref>[http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Zimbabwe_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Sinoia%20Caves%20()%20&toplace=Chirundu%20()&fromlat=-17.35&tolat=-16.0333333&fromlng=30.1333333&tolng=28.85 Map Showing Chinhoyi Caves And Chirundu With Distance Marker]</ref> The coordinates of Chinhoyi Caves are:17<U+00B0> 21' 0.00"S, 30<U+00B0> 7' 30.00"E (Latitude:-17.3500; Latitude:30.1250).

==Overview==
The cave system is composed of [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]], and the descent to the main cave with its pool of cobalt blue water is very impressive. This pool is popularly called ''Sleeping Pool'' or ''Chirorodzira'' (Pool of the Fallen). Divers have discovered a submarine passage leading from the ''Bat Cave'', a subchamber of the ''Dark Cave'' to another room known as the ''Blind Cave''. Diving is possible in the caves all year round, with temperatures never beyond the {{convert|22|to|24|C|F}} range with zero [[thermocline]]. Visibility is high, and {{convert|50|m|ft}} and above is not unusual. This site is often visited by diving expedition teams of [[technical diving|technical divers]] that perform [[Deep diving|ultra deep diving]]. It is not uncommon for dives in excess of {{convert|100|m|ft}} to be made here by experienced technical divers. There is a [[campsite]] run by the National Parks Authority and ''Caves Motel'', a quiet, private establishment is located on site.

==History==
The limestone caves were first described by [[Frederick Courtney Selous]] in 1888. The caves are named after a local chief who used them as a refuge from [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] raiders. These caves are the most extensive cave system in Zimbabwe that the public can access. The caves were designated a [[National Park]] in 1955 and as such are managed by the [http://www.zimparks.org/ Zimbwe Parks & Wildlife Management Authority]
