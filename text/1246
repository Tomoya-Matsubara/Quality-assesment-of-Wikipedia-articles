The '''Doom Bar''' (previously known as '''Dunbar sands''', '''Dune-bar''', and similar names), is a [[sandbar]] at the mouth of the [[estuary]] of the [[River Camel]] where it meets the [[Celtic Sea]] on the north coast of [[Cornwall]], England, UK. Like two other permanent sandbanks further up the estuary, the Doom Bar is composed mainly of marine sand that is continually being carried up from the seabed. More than 60 per cent of the sand is derived from marine shells making it an important source of [[liming (soil)|agricultural lime]] which has been collected for hundreds of years; an estimated ten million tons of sand or more has been removed from the estuary since the early 19th century, mainly by [[dredging]].

The estuary mouth, exposed to the Atlantic Ocean, is a highly dynamic environment, and the sands have been prone to dramatic shifts during storms. According to tradition, the Doom Bar formed in the reign of Henry VIII, damaging the prosperity of the port of [[Padstow]] a mile up the estuary.

Until the 20th century access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at [[Stepper Point]], a difficult passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the [[steerage]] wind was cut off by the cliffs. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and  quarrying away part of Stepper Point to improve the wind. In the early 20th century the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.

A [[Cornish folklore]] legend relates that a [[mermaid]] created the bar as a dying curse on the harbour after she was shot by a local man. The Doom Bar has been used in poetry to symbolise feelings of melancholy, and it has given its name to the flagship [[bitter (beer)|ale]] from Sharp's Brewery.

== Description ==
[[File:DoomBarRiverCamelCornwall2jpg.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The dangerous Doom Bar at low tide|The Doom Bar at low tide, with the river channel on the far side]]

The Doom Bar is a sandbar at the mouth of the [[River Camel|Camel estuary]] on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is composed mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by [[bed load]] processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary.<ref name="CISCAG41-2">Cornwall SMP2, pp.&nbsp;41<U+2013>42.</ref> This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of sediment transport within the estuary are complex and have not been fully elucidated.<ref name="CISCAG41-2" /> There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of it is deposited much higher up the estuary.<ref>Cornwall SMP2, p.&nbsp;40.</ref>

There are three persistent sandbars in the Camel estuary: the Doom Bar; the Town Bar at [[Padstow]], about {{convert|1|mi}} upstream; and the Halwyn Bank just upstream of Padstow, where the estuary changes direction.<ref>Cornwall SMP2, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> All three are of similar composition; a large proportion of their sediment is derived from marine [[mollusc shell]]s,<ref name="CISCAG39">Cornwall SMP2, p.&nbsp;39.</ref> and as a consequence it includes a high level of calcium carbonate, measured in 1982 at 62 per cent.<ref name="Merefield 1982" /> The high calcium carbonate content of the sand has meant that it has been used for hundreds of years to improve agricultural soil by [[Liming (soil)|liming]]. This use is known to date back to before 1600.<ref name="Bath and West England" /> High calcium carbonate levels combined with natural sea salt made the sand valuable to farmers as an [[alkaline]] fertiliser when mixed with manure.<ref name="shell" />

In a report published in 1839, [[Henry De la Beche]] estimated that the sand from the Doom Bar accounted for between a fifth and a quarter of the sand used for agriculture in Devon and Cornwall.<ref name="De La Beche" /> He also stated that around 80 men were permanently employed to dredge the area from several barges, removing an estimated {{convert|100,000|LT|kg}} of sand per year, which he said he had been "assured by competent persons" had caused a reduction in height of the bar of between {{convert|6|and|8|ft|cm|-1}} in the 50 years before 1836.<ref name="De La Beche" /> Another report, published about twenty years earlier by [[Samuel Drew]], stated, however, that although the sandbars had been "pillaged" for ages they remained undiminished.<ref name="Hitchens 1824" /> An estimated ten million tons of sediment was removed from the estuary between 1836 and 1989, mostly for agricultural purposes and mostly from the Doom Bar.<ref name="CISCAG39" /> Sand is still regularly dredged from the area; in 2009 an estimated 120,000 tons of sand were removed from the bar and the surrounding estuary.<ref name="Port of Padstow" />

There is a [[submerged forest]] beneath the eastern part of the Doom Bar, off [[Daymer Bay]].<ref name="PeatDatabase3" /> It is believed to be part of the wooded plain that existed off the current Cornwall coast before it was overcome by sand dunes and beach sand during the last significant rise in sea-level, which ended around 4,000 years ago.<ref name="Bristow133" /> Exposed as they are to the Atlantic Ocean, the sands of the area have always been prone to sudden shifts: several houses were said to have been buried one night during a powerful storm.<ref name="British History"/> According to tradition one such shift led to the formation of the Doom Bar during the reign of Henry VIII (1509<U+2013>1547), causing a decline in the prosperity of Padstow.<ref name="Paris 1863" /> Today, the sandbank covers approximately {{convert|0.4|mi2}}, linking the beaches near [[Harbour Cove]] by [[sand flat]]s, although the actual size and shape varies.<ref>Cornwall SMP2, p.&nbsp;43.</ref>

The name "Doom Bar" is a corruption of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] word ''dunbar''<ref name="Paris 1863" /> or ''dune-bar'',<ref name="shell" /> a combination of two words "dun" and "bar". Both can mean hill or summit,<ref name="Cornish Vocab" /> and are associated with sand. Although the bar was commonly known as "Dunbar sands" before 1900, the name "Doom Bar" was used in 1761 (as "the Doom-bar"),<ref name="Griffin 1761" /> and it was also used in poetry,<ref name="victorian anthology" /> and in House of Commons papers in the 19th century.<ref name=Committ1858_100 />

== Danger to shipping ==
[[File:Camel Estuary 1825 and 2010.png|thumb|left|alt=Representation of two admiralty charts, 1825 and 2010, showing movement of the river channel|The Doom Bar has moved significantly between 1825 and 2010.]]
For centuries, the Doom Bar was regarded as a significant danger to ships<U+2014>to be approached with caution to avoid running aground. When sails were the main source of power, ships coming round Stepper Point would lose the wind, causing loss of [[steerage]], leaving them to drift away from the [[river channel|channel]]. Sometimes, gusts of wind known colloquially as "flaws"<ref name="Cornish Vocab" /> blew over Stepper Point and pushed vessels towards the sandbank.<ref name="seaman's guide" /> Dropping anchor would not help, as it could not gain a firm hold on the sand.<ref name="Time Team" /> Richard Hellyer, the Sub-Commissioner of Pilotage at Padstow, gave evidence in 1859 that the Doom Bar was regarded as so dangerous that in a storm, vessels would risk being wrecked on the coast rather than negotiate the channel to Padstow harbour.<ref>Reports from Commissioners (1859), p&nbsp;302</ref>

In 1761 John Griffin published a letter in the ''[[London Chronicle]]'' in which he recommended methods for entering the Camel estuary during rough weather, particularly while north-northwest winds were blowing. Griffin also described the bolts and rings that he had fixed to the cliffs to assist ships trying to enter the harbour.<ref name="Griffin 1761" /> Mooring rings were still there in 1824,<ref name="Hitchens 1824" /> and in around 1830 further safety features were installed, such as three [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]]s at the base of the cliffs,<ref name="NF39" /> and bollards along the cliffs, by which means boats could be [[warping (sailing)|warped]] safely past the Doom Bar.<ref name="Rainsley 2008" />

In 1846, the Plymouth and Padstow Railway company took an interest in trying to remove the Doom Bar, hoping to increase the trade through the harbour at Padstow. The plan was to create a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.<ref name="Clarke 1846" />

In the event, neither the breakwater nor the railway were built, but the issue was re-examined by the 1858 British Parliamentary [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Harbours for Refuge. The select committee took evidence from many witnesses about harbours all around the country. For Padstow, evidence included that taken from a Captain Claxton, RN, who stated that without the removal of the sand, ships in distress could only use the harbour at high tide.<ref name=Committ1858_100>Reports from Committees (1858), pp.&nbsp;100<U+2013>101.</ref> The committee was also told by J. D. Bryant, a port commissioner and Receiver of Wreck for Padstow,<ref>Reports from Committees (1858), p.&nbsp;77.</ref> that in 1848 the Padstow Harbour Association had cut down a small piece of Stepper Point, which had given ships about 50 fathoms of extra "fair wind" into the harbour. Bryant recommended further removal of the point which would allow a true wind along the whole channel past the dangerous sandbar.<ref>Reports from Committees (1858), p.&nbsp;79.</ref>

[[File:Doom Bar from Daymer bay.jpg|thumb|alt=The Doom Bar and Stepper Point from Daymer Bay|The Doom Bar and Stepper Point from Daymer Bay; the dip caused by rock being removed from Stepper Point is clearly visible.]]
The select committee report concluded the bar would return through re-silting if it were dredged, and there were insufficient resources to prevent this. A number of alternatives were discussed, including the construction of two guide walls to sluice the water across the bar, thereby removing it.<ref name=Committ1858_100 /> However, evidence was given that the bar was made up of "hard sand" which would prove difficult to remove.<ref name="Commiss1859_308">Reports from Commissioners (1859), p.&nbsp;308.</ref> During the course of the discussions, it was indicated that whilst the sandbank could be removed by a variety of methods, it would not significantly improve the harbour, and that a harbour of refuge would be better on the Welsh coast.<ref name=Committ1858_100 />

The Committee's final report determined that along the whole of the rocky coast between [[Lands End]] and [[Hartland Point]], Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the [[coasting trade]] when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted, though, that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended an initial expenditure of <U+00A3>20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point,<ref name="Commiss1859_xiii">Reports from Commissioners (1859), p.&nbsp;xiii.</ref> and this, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, significantly reduced the risk to shipping.

During the 20th century the Doom Bar was regularly dredged to improve the access to Padstow. By the 1930s, when Commander H.E. Turner surveyed the area, there were two channels round the Doom Bar,<ref name="Morris 1995" /> and it is thought that the main channel may have moved to the east side of the estuary in 1929.<ref>Cornwall SMP2, p.&nbsp;36.</ref> By 2010 the original channel had disappeared.  The Camel estuary is still dredged by Padstow Harbour Commission's two dredgers, ''Sandsnipe'' and ''Mannin''.<ref name="Stepper Point Newsletter 2008" />

== Shipwrecks ==
[[File:The Old Padstow Lifeboat House - geograph.org.uk - 312833.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The old Padstow Lifeboat Station|The remains of the old [[Padstow Lifeboat Station]], replaced in 2006]]
The Doom Bar has accounted for more than 600 beachings, capsizings and wrecks since records began early in the 19th century,<ref name="French 2007" /> the majority of which are wrecks.<ref name="Carter 1970" />

Larger boats entering Padstow were offered assistance, generally by [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled it would be entering. If a boat was foundering, [[Marine salvage|salvors]] would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the [[brig]] ''The Towan'', which floundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.<ref name="Admiralty Reports 1843<U+2013>1850" />

In 1827, the recently founded [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|Life-boat Institution]] helped fund a permanent [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] at Padstow, a {{convert|23|ft}} rowboat with four oars. The lifeboat house at [[Hawker's Cove, Cornwall|Hawker's Cove]] was erected two years later by the Padstow Harbour Association for the Preservation of Life and Property from Shipwreck. Reverend Charles Prideaux-Brune of [[Prideaux Place]] was set up as the patron.<ref name="NF39">Noall & Farr (1964), p.&nbsp;39.</ref> In 1879, four of his grand-daughters along with their friend were rowing on the Doom Bar and saw a craft go down. They rowed out to save the drowning sailor. As it was very unusual for women to rescue men in these circumstances, all five girls received a [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] Silver Medal for their bravery.<ref name="Larn Larn" />

Despite the safer eastern channel and improvements in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing lifejackets drowned after their boat capsized.<ref name="Lakeman 1997" /> Two anglers were killed in a similar incident in 1994.<ref name="pond" /> On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.<ref name="This Is Cornwall" />

=== HMS ''Whiting'' ===
[[File:Stepper Point Lithograph.jpg|thumb|alt=Lithograph of proposed capstans on Stepper Point|A lithograph of Stepper Point by the Padstow Harbour Association, showing the location of the HMS ''Whiting'' wreck]]
{{main|HMS Whiting (1812)}}
The only warship reported wrecked on the Doom Bar was [[HMS Whiting (1812)|HMS ''Whiting'']], a 12-gun [[schooner]]. The ''Whiting'' was originally a cargo ship named ''Arrow'', which travelled from the United States to France; she was captured by the [[Royal Navy]] on 8 May 1812 and renamed.<ref name="Nautical Archaeology Society" /> On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing, the wind came from unfavourable direction and so offered little assistance. According to [[court martial]] transcripts, an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and it became impossible to save her.<ref name="Court martial papers 1816" />

''Whiting'' was abandoned over the next few days, with the crew salvaging whatever they could. The officer in charge, Lieutenant John Jackson, lost one year's seniority for negligence, and three crewmen were given "50 lashes with [[Cat o' nine tails|nine tails]]" for desertion. The wreck was sold to salvors and, despite correspondence requesting her move eleven years later, the Navy took no further interest in her.<ref name="Petition to remove 1827" /> The Royal Navy attempted to survey the wreck in June 1830, by which time the sandbank had covered the majority of the wreck.<ref name="ProMare" /> In May 2010 a marine research and exploration group, ProMare, and the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]], with the help of Padstow Primary School, mounted a search to find the ship.<ref name="Cornish Guardian 2010" /> The groups searched four sites on the Doom Bar, but have so far been unsuccessful.<ref name="ProMare current" />

=== ''Antoinette'' ===
{{main|Antoinette (barque)}}
The largest ship wrecked on the Doom Bar is believed to be the [[Antoinette (barque)|''Antoinette'']], an 1874 [[barque]] of 1,118 tonnes.<ref>Johns, Camidge & Northover (2011), p.&nbsp;32.<!-- quoting Carter 1970, p 155 --></ref> On New Year's Day 1895, she set sail from [[Newport]] in South Wales with a cargo of coal for Brazil, but foundered near [[Lundy Island]], losing several parts of her mast.<ref name="Cornwall news" /> She was towed by a steam tug towards Padstow but struck the Doom Bar and the tow rope either broke,<ref>Noall & Farr (1964), p.&nbsp;32.</ref> or had to be released.<ref>Johns, Camidge & Northover (2011), p.&nbsp;43 (quoting the ''Royal Cornwall Gazette'', 1895).</ref> Her crew of fourteen and several men who had attempted to salvage her were rescued by lifeboats from [[Port Isaac]] and Padstow, following which she rapidly sank.<ref>Noall & Farr (1964), p.&nbsp;57.</ref>

Attempts by three tugs from Cardiff to remove the wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the mid-section up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping.<ref name="Padstow Museum" /> A miner named Pope was called in to remove it: he used [[gelignite]] without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town.<ref name="Padstow Museum" /> In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the ''Antoinette'', surfaced on Town Bar.<ref>Johns, Camidge & Northover (2011), p.&nbsp;33.</ref> The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.<ref>Johns, Camidge & Northover (2011), p.&nbsp;9.</ref>

According to local folklore, the Doom Bar was created by the Mermaid of Padstow as a dying curse after being shot. In 1906, [[Enys Tregarthen]] wrote that a Padstow local, Tristram Bird, bought a new gun and wanted to shoot something worthy of it. He went hunting seals at Hawker's Cove but found a young woman sat on a rock brushing her hair. Entranced by her beauty, he offered to marry her and when she refused he shot her in retaliation, only realising afterwards that she was a mermaid. As she died she cursed the harbour with a "bar of doom", from Hawker's Cove to [[Trebetherick]] Bay. A terrible gale blew up that night and when it finally subsided there was the sandbar, "covered with wrecks of ships and bodies of drowned men".<ref name="legends" />

The ballad, ''The Mermaid of Padstow'',<ref name="brimley" /> tells a similar story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal.<ref name="Andrews 2004" /> [[John Betjeman]], who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man and fell in love with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by shooting her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew.<ref name="Betjeman" /> In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings upon the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a [[crossbow]],<ref name="Alness 1930" /> or a greedy man shoots her with a [[longbow]].<ref name="Berry 1949" />

The mermaid legend has been extended beyond the creation of the Doom Bar.  In 1939 Samuel Williamson declared there are mermaids comparable to [[Siren]]s in the area, who lie in the shallow waters and draw in ships to be wrecked.<ref name="Williamson 1939" /> In addition, "the distressful cry of a woman bewailing her dead" is said to be heard after a storm where lives are lost on the sandbar.<ref name="legends" />

[[Rosamund Marriott Watson|Rosamund Watson]]'s "Ballad of Pentyre Town"<ref name="Watson" /> uses the sandbank for imagery to elicit feelings of melancholy when talking of giving up everything for love.<ref name="Hughes 2005" /> The area was the subject of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poem by [[Alice E. Gillington]], "The Doom-Bar". It relates the story of a girl who gave an engraved ring to the man she loved, who then sailed away across the Doom Bar, breaking her heart. Four years later, when the tide was lower than they had ever seen it, her friends persuaded her to come out and walk upon the sand, where she found the ring inside a [[scallop]]. Realising that he must have tossed it aside on the night he left, she resolved not to remain heart-broken, but to sail out to sea herself.<ref name="victorian anthology" />

A play entitled ''The Doom Bar'', about [[smuggling]] and [[wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]] in the area, was written in the early 1900s by [[Arthur Hansen Bush]]. Although there was no interest in London, it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in cities including [[Chicago]] and [[New York]]. However, there were a series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker [[Cruel Coppinger]], culminating in a fire at [[Baltimore]], after which the play was considered by America's actors' unions to be cursed, and its members were banned from appearing in it.<ref name="Macklin 1981" />

== ''Doom Bar'' bitter ==
''Doom Bar'' (4.0% abv) is a [[bitter (beer)|bitter]] brewed by [[Sharp's Brewery]] at [[Rock, Cornwall|Rock]], a village on the estuary opposite Padstow. It is the brewery's flagship beer, accounting for 90 per cent of sales and with an output of {{convert|24000000|imppt|kl}} in 2010.<ref name="The Publican 2010" /> In 2011, sales increased by 22 per cent, making it the UK's fastest growing ale for three years in a row.<ref name="Doom bar fastest 2011" />

Doom Bar bitter became the first official beer sponsor of the [[The Boat Race|Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]] between 2008 and 2012.<ref name="Morning Advertiser 2009" /> Securing the "Doom Bar brand" was cited as the reason that [[Molson Coors]] spent <U+00A3>20 million on their takeover of Sharp's Brewery in 2011; Doom Bar is now the largest cask ale brand in Molson Coors' portfolio.<ref name="CAMRA 2011" />
