"'''Stairmageddon'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[The Office (U.S. season 9)|ninth season]] of the American [[comedy]] [[television series]] ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]''. It originally aired on the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) on April 11, 2013. The episode features guest appearances from [[Roseanne Barr]] as Andy's agent Carly Fern and [[Paul Feig]] as a man auditioning his act for Carla.

The series<U+2014>presented as if it were a [[mockumentary|real documentary]]<U+2014>depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, the office workers are forced to walk up the stairs when the elevator's power goes out, a situation everyone deems as "Stairmaggedon". [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) coerces [[Stanley Hudson]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) into doing an important sales call. [[Pam Halpert]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) find comfort in talking with [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) and [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) about marital troubles. Meanwhile, [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) supports her husband during a press conference.  

"Stairmageddon" received mixed-to-positive reviews from television critics. The episode was viewed by 3.84 million viewers and received a 1.9/5 perfect among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked second in its timselot and ''The Office'' was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.

==Plot==
Everyone in the office grows anxious as the premiere of the [[PBS]] TV documentary ''The Office: An American Workplace'' draws near. [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) combines an unflattering appraisal of himself from an early newspaper of the program and his blunt self-assessment that he's unlikely to remain employed at Dunder Mifflin for very long after it airs, and decides it's time to pursue his acting dreams. After many fruitless calls to dismissive talent agencies, he finds himself at the dual talent agency/real estate office run by Carla Fern ([[Roseanne Barr]]). Carla agrees to represent Andy, who is thrilled that he only has to pay $5,000 for the privilege.

The office workers are forced to walk up the stairs when the elevator's power goes out, a situation everyone deems the "Stairmageddon". [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]), the owner of the building, has enraged a badly out-of-shape [[Stanley Hudson]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) by scheduling the repairs during work hours. When Dwight insists Stanley join him on an important sales call where the client is a longtime friend of Stanley, he is rebuffed. So Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never, ever, ever be the Branch Manager at Dunder Mifflin or likely any company in the U.S.) forthrightly shoots Stanley with three bull tranquilizers and knocks him out. With some help from Clark, Dwight is able to ship Stanley to the car and a groggy Stanley helps them actually close the sale. Stanley seems to have forgiven being drugged, and gets revenge when they return; the elevator is still out, so Stanley simply pilfers one of Dwight's darts and knocks himself out, leaving Dwight to figure out how to get Stanley back upstairs. 

[[Pam Halpert|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) and [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) talk with [[Nellie Bertram]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) and [[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) about their struggling marriage and plans to go to counseling for it. Toby points out to Jim that it's not really fair to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family like he says it will, Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her (while Jim snarks to Toby that if Pam was left to make her own decisions, she'd have ended up marrying Roy) and they each agree they're not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.

Meanwhile, [[Angela Martin|Angela Lipton]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) is agreeing to be the supportive "good wife" as her State Senator husband Robert prepares for a press conference in the aftermath of the documentary's reveal of his sexuality. To Angela's horror, Robert quickly tells the press that he's gay. [[Oscar Martinez (The Office)|Oscar Martinez]] ([[Oscar Nunez]]) is thrilled to hear this and nearly bursting with pride when Robert publicly praises him, but Oscar's joy is short-lived when Robert says that he is in love with his Chief of Staff, Casey Silver. [[Kevin Malone]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]) is ecstatic that he did end up keeping Oscar's secret after all.

===Reviews===
"Stairmageddon" received mixed reviews from television critics, with praise going to the drama in the Jim-Pam storyline, while the zaniness of other storylines received more mixed opinions. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' reviewer Erik Adams complimented the drama created between Jim and Pam, writing that it's "been given just the right amount of weight".<ref name="avclub">{{cite web|last=Adams |first=Erik |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/stairmageddon,96353/ |title=<U+201C>Stairmageddon<U+201D> &#124; The Office &#124; TV Club &#124; TV |publisher=''[[The A.V.

Roth Cornet of [[IGN]] called "Stairmageddon" an "odd one" for feeling like both a standalone episode that utilized the full ensemble, but also "one of the final five episodes of this nine-year series", due to the Jim-Pam and Dwight-Angela storyline.<ref name="ign">{{cite web|author=Cornet, Roth |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/12/the-office-stairmaggedon-review |title=The Office: "Stairmageddon" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=April 12, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref> He praised the Jim-Pam storyline for its realism and depth, but wrote that felt worried that their eventual reconciliation would fail and not feel earned, due to the few episodes left in the series.<ref name="ign"/> Cornet, meanwhile, praised the Dwight-Clark-Stanley storyline, writing that "the true comedy in the episode came primarily from Dwight" and called it [[Clark Duke]]'s "strongest appearance to date".<ref name="ign"/> Cornet ultimately gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10, calling it "Good".<ref name="ign"/> Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic called the episode "the funniest episode on television this week", considering it to be a "gem" from the season.<ref name="tvfanatic">{{cite web|last=Forcella |first=Dan |url=http://origin.tvfanatic.com/2013/05/the-office-review-assistant-to-the/ |title=The Office Review: Assistant to the... - TV Fanatic |publisher=TV Fanatic |date= |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}</ref> Forcella also praised the Jim-Pam-Dwight dynamic throughout the episode and the humor coming from Andy's storyline.<ref name="tvfanatic"/> He ultimately awarded the episode 5 stars out of 5.<ref name="tvfanatic"/>
