'''''Ex parte Crow Dog''''', [[Case citation|109 U.S. 556]] (1883), was a case that involved a conflict between two members of the same [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe on  [[Indian reservation|reservation]] land where one, [[Crow Dog]], killed the other. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a federal court did not have jurisdiction to try Crow Dog, a member of the [[Brul<U+00E9>]] band of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Sioux, when the offense had already been tried by the tribal council.  The tribe handled the case according to [[Sioux]] tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution.  However, the United States government then also tried Crow Dog for murder, and he was sentenced to hang. On his appeal to the Supreme Court, the court held that unless [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized it, the courts had no jurisdiction to try the case.<ref name="SCOTUS">Ex parte Crow Dog, {{ussc|109|556|1883}}.</ref> This case resulted in Congress enacting the [[Major Crimes Act]] in 1885, placing 15 major crimes under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land.  This case was the beginning of the [[Plenary power|plenary power]] legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit [[Tribal sovereignty|tribal sovereignty]].

On August 5, 1881, Crow Dog shot and killed Spotted Tail,{{#tag:ref|Spotted Tail's Lakota name was Si<U+014B>t<U+00E9> Gle<U+0161>k<U+00E1>.<ref>{{smallcaps|Harring}}, ''supra'', at 282.</ref>|group="fn"}} who was the uncle of [[Oglala Lakota]] war leader [[Crazy Horse]].<ref name="HydeSpotted">{{smallcaps|George Hyde & Harry H.

==Opinion of the Court==
[[File:Thomas Stanley Matthews - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=photograph of Justice T. Stanley Matthews|Justice T. Stanley Matthews, author of the unanimous opinion]]
Justice [[Stanley Matthews (lawyer)|Stanley Matthews]] delivered the opinion of the unanimous court.  Matthews noted that Crow Dog was indicted for murder under a statute prohibiting murder on federal land.{{#tag:ref|"Every person who commits murder-- ... or in any other place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States; ... shall suffer death."<ref name="RS5339">[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=018/llsl018.db&recNum=1110 Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 145] {{usstat|18|1038}}.</ref>|group="fn"}}<ref name="RS5339" />  Matthews then looked at the federal laws dealing with Indians, including a statute that applied the prohibition on murder to Indian reservations{{#tag:ref|"...the general laws of the United States as to punishment of crimes committed in any place within the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, except the District of Columbia, shall extend to Indian country."<ref name="RS2145">[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=018/llsl018.db&recNum=446 Act of Mar. 27, 1854, ch. 26] {{usstat|18|374}}.</ref>|group="fn"}}<ref name="RS2145" /> and another covering exceptions to prosecution.{{#tag:ref|"The preceding section shall not be construed to extend to crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to any Indian committing any offense who has been punished by the local laws of the tribe..."<ref name="RS2146">[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=018/llsl018.db&recNum=446 Act of Feb. 18, 1875, ch. 80] {{usstat|18|374}}.</ref>|group="fn"}}<ref name="RS2146" />  The first statute prohibited murder on federal land, the second statute applied the first statute to reservations, and the last had specific exceptions to prosecution.  Matthews felt that this last section was the most critical one in the case, with the section stating unequivocally that federal law: "shall not be construed to extend to <nowiki>[crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another Indian, nor to]</nowiki> any Indian committing any offense in the Indian country who has been punished by the local law of the tribe"<ref name="RS2146" /> (brackets in original).  Matthews rejected the contention of the United States that the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie implicitly repealed the exceptions to prosecution.  He stated that since the law had not been amended or changed, and since implied repeals are not favored unless the implication is necessary, to allow such a repeal would be to reverse the general policy of the United States.  Matthews said that such a repeal required a "clear expression of the intention of Congress," which was not present in the case.  In a clear evocation of the principle of tribal sovereignty,<ref name=Clinton>Robert N. Clinton, ''There Is No Federal Supremacy Clause For Indian Tribes'' {{smallcaps|34 Ariz. St. L.J. 113}} (2002).</ref> Matthews stated:

<blockquote>"It tries them, not by their peers, nor by the customs of their people, nor the law of their land, but by superiors of a different race, according to the law of a social state of which they have an imperfect conception, and  which is opposed to the traditions of their history, to the habits of their lives, to the strongest prejudices of their savage nature; one which measures the red man's revenge by the maxims of the white man's morality."<ref name="SCOTUS" /><ref>{{smallcaps|Deloria}}, ''supra'', at 26.</ref><ref name="Washburn">Kevin K. Washburn, ''Federal Criminal Law and Tribal Self-Determination'' 84 {{smallcaps|N.C.L. Rev.}} 779 (2006).</ref></blockquote>

As a result, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear the case, and the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued, discharging Crow Dog from federal custody.<ref name="SCOTUS" /><ref>{{smallcaps|Harring}}, ''supra'', at 129.</ref>

==Subsequent developments==

===Major Crimes Act of 1885===
Shocked by the Supreme Court's decision and under strong pressure from the BIA,<ref name=Clinton /> Congress passed the [[Major Crimes Act]] in response.{{#tag:ref|The bill's sponsor, Representative Cutcheon expressed "anger" at the release of a "murderer" into society.<ref name=McGoldrick>Susan M. McGoldrick, ''Jurisdiction to Sentence and Convict for Lesser Included Offenses under the Major Crimes Act: A Critical Assessment of the Keeble Legacy'' {{smallcaps|12 Am. Indian L. Rev. 219}} (1984).</ref>|group="fn"}}<ref>{{smallcaps|Deloria}}, ''supra'', at 4, 29.</ref><ref>Powell, ''supra'', at 286.</ref>  The Major Crimes Act placed seven serious felony offenses (with amendments over the years, it is now fifteen) under the jurisdiction of the federal government.{{#tag:ref|The original offenses were murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to commit murder, arson, burglary, and larceny.  Later, Congress added kidnapping, maiming, incest, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with serious bodily injury, assault of a child under 16, child abuse or neglect, robbery, or a felony under 18 USC Ch. 109A (Sexual Abuse).  Territorially, it covered "Indian Country", defined as all reservation land, all Indian allotments, and all dependent Indian communities outside of reservations.  The crime had to be committed by an Indian for federal jurisdiction to apply.<ref>{{usc|18|1151|1153}}</ref>|group="fn"}}  Those wishing to [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|assimilate]] Indians into mainstream white society{{#tag:ref|This included eastern liberal reformers, such as the Indian Rights Association.<ref name="French" />|group="fn"}} wanted to do away with the "heathen" tribal laws and apply white laws to the tribes.<ref name="French" /><ref name="Hall">{{smallcaps|The Oxford guide to United States Supreme Court decisions}} 66 (Kermit L. Hall, ed., 2001).</ref>  The BIA had also been attempting since 1874 to extend federal jurisdiction over major crimes to reservations, without any success.<ref>{{smallcaps|Harring}}, ''supra'', at 115-116, 134-135.</ref>  Beginning in 1882, the [[Indian Rights Association]] (IRA) also tried to extend federal jurisdiction, but in a different manner.<ref name="Harring">{{smallcaps|Tribal Criminal Law and Procedure}} 40-50 (Carrie E. Garrow & Sarah Deer, eds., 2004).</ref><ref>{{smallcaps|Harring}}, ''supra'', at 134.</ref>  The IRA believed that the tribes would be better served by a completely separate court system, modeled after U.S. courts and called agency courts.  The only appeal would be to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs.<ref name="Harring" />  The BIA opposed that approach, preferring to try only major crimes in the nearest federal court.  ''Ex parte Crow Dog'' provided the BIA a perfect example of why this was needed, along with an incident involving Spotted Tail's son, Spotted Tail, Jr., in which the younger Spotted Tail participated in a fight during which three Brul<U+00E9> were killed.{{#tag:ref|Following a dispute over a woman, White Thunder and Spotted Tail, Jr. were involved in a fight.  White Thunder, his father, and Song Pumpkin were slain and Spotted Tail, Jr. arrested and confined in jail.  Spotted Tail, Jr. was the only Indian released from custody as a result of ''Ex parte Crow Dog''.<ref name=Harring2 />|group="fn"}}<ref name=Harring2 />  The younger Spotted Tail was also confined pending murder charges, and it took a direct order of the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] for the local BIA agents to comply with the Supreme Court decision before he was released.<ref name="Washburn" /><ref name=Harring2>''Id.'', at 133.</ref>  The BIA also implemented regulations in 1883 criminalizing traditional tribal practices such as war dances and polygamy.<ref name=Box />  Between the BIA's efforts and the IRA efforts, the law was passed in 1885, making seven offenses federal crimes.<ref>''Id.'', at 136-140.</ref>  Many members of the Indian tribes were bitter with this outcome for decades afterwards. [[Wayne Ducheneaux]], president of the [[National Congress of American Indians]], testified before Congress on the matter in 1968:<ref name=Probasco>Robert D. Probasco, ''Indian Tribes, Civil Rights, and Federal Courts'' 7 {{smallcaps|Tex. Wesleyan L. Rev.}} 119 (2001).</ref> 

<blockquote>"Before all this came about we had our own method of dealing with law-breakers and in settling disputes between members.  That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail.  Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe.  But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't know how to handle murderers and they were going to show us."<ref name=Probasco /></blockquote>

In 2000, [[Larry EchoHawk]], a [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] who had been the [[State attorney general|Attorney General]] of [[Idaho]] and was later the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs#Commissioners and Assistant Secretaries|Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs]], noted that: "The Major Crimes Act was designed to give the federal government authority to criminally prosecute seven specific major crimes committed by Indians in Indian Country. It was a direct assault on the sovereign authority of tribal government over tribal members."<ref name=EchoHawk>[[Larry EchoHawk]], ''Review: Justice for Native Americans Requires Returning to Our Constitutional Origins Vine Deloria, Jr. & David E. Wilkins Tribes, Treaties, and Constitutional Tribulations'', 4 {{smallcaps|Green Bag 2d}} 101 (2000).</ref>

===Tribal sovereignty===
''Crow Dog'' had a tremendous impact on [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]].<ref>{{smallcaps|Harring}}, ''supra'', at 219.</ref>  The decision recognized two distinct concepts in addition to those related to criminal law.  First, Justice Matthews had noted that under ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', (1831)<ref name="Cherokee">[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]], {{ussc|30|1|1831|Pet.|5}}.</ref> the Brul<U+00E9> tribe had a right to its own law in [[Indian Country]].<ref name="Gulig">Anthony G. Gulig & Sidney L. Harring, ''An Indian cannot get a morsel of pork...": A retrospective on Crow Dog, Lone Wolf, Blackbird, Tribal Sovereignty, Indian Land and writing Indian history'' 38 {{smallcaps|Tulsa L. Rev.}} 87 (2002).</ref>  Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition - at that time, Indians were not U.S. citizens{{#tag:ref|Indians did not become U.S. citizens until 1924, upon passage of the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]]<ref name=ICA1924>[[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924]], Act of Jun. 2, 1924, ch. 233 {{usstat|43|253}}.</ref>|group="fn"}} and according to Matthews did not have a <U+201C>voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws.<U+201D><ref name="SCOTUS" /><ref name=Clinton />  The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty, and was still valid law.  For example, ''[[United States v. Lara]]'', (2004)<ref name="Lara">[[United States v. Lara]], {{ussc|541|193|2004}}.</ref> cited ''Crow Dog'' when holding that both a tribe and the federal government could prosecute Lara, as they were separate sovereigns.  Subsequent cases have supported the concept "that tribal Indians living in Indian country are citizens of the United States first (under the [[plenary power]] doctrine), the tribes second, and the states third, and then only to the extent that Congress chooses."<ref name=Frickey>Philip P. Frickey, ''Congressional Intent, Practical Reasoning, And The Dynamic Nature Of Federal Indian Law'' {{smallcaps|78 Cal. L. Rev. 1137}} (1990).</ref> 

Currently the tribes are authorized to operate their own courts, not as a right of tribal sovereignty, but under a federal law.<ref name=Box /><ref name=IRA>[[Indian Reorganization Act|Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], Jun. 18, 1934, ch. 576 {{usstat|48|984}}.</ref>  As of 2007, about half of the federally recognized tribes have tribal courts.<ref name=Box />  The power of these courts are limited to minor crimes with a maximum punishment of a $5,000 fine and imprisonment of no more than one year.<ref name=ICRA>[[Indian Civil Rights Act|Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968]], Apr. 11, 1968, {{usstat|82|77}}.</ref>  As a result of Crow Dog and ensuing legislation, jurisdiction in Indian country is complex, as shown by the following table:<ref name=Handler>Matthew Handler, ''Tribal Law And Disorder: A Look at a System of Broken Justice in Indian Country and the Steps Needed to Fix It'' {{smallcaps|75 Brook.

===Plenary power doctrine===
The court also created the plenary power doctrine, holding that the federal court did not have jurisdiction because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away the rights of the tribe.<ref name="Gulig" />  ''Crow Dog'' was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with ''Cherokee Nation''; the next major case, ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'', (1886),<ref name="Kagama">[[United States v.
