'''RAW THRILLS, INC.''' was founded in 2001 by ''[[Eugene Jarvis]]'', [[Deepak Deo]], and [[Andrew Eloff]].  The staff also consists of other former ''[[Midway Games]]'' employees.  Currently the staff runs around 25 employees, most of whom have been with the company for the majority of its existence.

Early on, the company made games for ''[[International Game Technology|IGT]]'' including ''[[Super Times Pay Poker]]'', ''[[Multi-Play Blackjack]]'', and ''[[Turbo Reelette]]'' with later games involving modifications of the Super Times Pay engine.

RAW THRILLS's first independent coin-op game was ''[[Target: Terror]]'', a light-gun shooter game which was later upgraded to ''[[Target: Terror Gold]]'' (also known as Target: Force) featuring bonus levels, end-of-round awards, and other performance enhancements. ''[[Target: Terror]]'' was the first gun game designed under the direction of Eugene Jarvis. 

The company's second game was ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'', a racing game based on the Universal Studios movie of the same name.  Tsunami Visual Technologies later made a motion version of the game for large family entertainment centers.

In 2006, Raw Thrills published two titles:''[[Big Buck Hunter PRO]]'', developed by ''[[Play Mechanix]]''; and ''[[The Fast and the Furious Superbikes]]''.
