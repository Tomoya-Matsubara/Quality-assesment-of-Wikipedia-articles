The '''Mayor of London's Skyride''' is a major [[cycling]] event in [[London]], England, aimed at cyclists of every age and ability. Originally inaugurated in 2007 as the ''London Freewheel'' it was renamed for 2008 as the ''Sky Sports London Freewheel''. For the 2009 event it was renamed again to the ''Mayor of London's Skyride'' following a multi-year sponsorship deal between [[Sky Sports]] and the [[Mayor of London]].

For the 2009 ride a smaller, local event in outer London was added; this took place in [[Hounslow]] on Sunday August 9.<ref name="Mayor1997">[http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/assemmtgs/2008/mqtoct15/minutes/written_answers.pdf Written answers] no. 1997 of 2008, London Mayor's Question Time, 15 October 2008</ref>,

Since at least 50,000 are estimated to have taken part in both 2007 and 2008, the central route for 2009 was extended to increase capacity. The route passes some of London's most famous landmarks along [[Victoria Embankment]], and the 2009 ride was expanded to include a new loop through the [[City of London]].

== Background ==
[[Cycling in London]] grew by 83 per cent from 2000 to 2007.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} It is estimated that 40 per cent of Londoners have access to a bike, but only five per cent use one regularly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

The [[Mayor of London]] and [[Transport for London]] increased investment in cycling by 50 per cent in 2007/08 from <U+00A3>24 million in 2006/07 to <U+00A3>36 million in 2007/08. In 2000 investment in cycling stood at just <U+00A3>5.5 million. This money is being spent on improved cycle parking facilities, education and training, events and cycle promotion. 500km of the [[London Cycle Network Plus]] - a network of signed routes for cyclists across the capital - has already been completed and the full 900km network will be completed by the end of 2010. [[Transport for London]] has installed 10,000 cycling parking spaces across the capital in the past two years.

=== 2009 (Mayor of London's Skyride) ===
The 2009 Mayor of London's Skyride took place on the 20th September.

The Mayor had announced in October 2008 that the central route would again be reviewed, considering opportunities for including part of the 2012 road cycling course or the 2009 [[Tour of Britain#2009 Tour of Britain|Tour of Britain]] route. He also planned to work with [[outer London]] boroughs, where he sees most scope for an increase in cycling, to host their own Freewheel events.<ref name=Mayor1997>[http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/assemmtgs/2008/mqtoct15/minutes/written_answers.pdf Written answers] no. 1997 of 2008, London Mayor's Question Time, 15 October 2008</ref>

London Freewheel took place on Sunday 21 September 2008, organised by TfL and the new mayor [[Boris Johnson]],
and sponsored by [[Sky Sports]].<ref name=ES240108>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23433887-details/100%2C000+to+Freewheel+in+London%27s+streets/article.do 100,000 to Freewheel in London's streets], [[Evening Standard]], 24 Jan 2008</ref> Sky contributed <U+00A3>100,000<ref name=Guardian2008/> out of the total <U+00A3>780,000 raised in commercial sponsorship and support.<ref name=Mayor2185/>

The 2008 event was announced as accommodating 100,000,<ref name=ES240108/> but this was later scaled back to 45,000.<ref name=Guardian2008>Hugh Muir, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/11/1 Guardian.co.uk], September 11 2008</ref> Organisers estimated that 50,000 took part.<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-mayor/article-23558635-details/Mayor+and+gold+medallist+take+50%2C000+on+ride+through+car-free+London/article.do Mayor and gold medallist take 50,000 on ride through car-free London], [[Evening Standard]], 22 September 2008</ref>

A different route, 12 km in length, between the [[Tower of London]] and [[Buckingham Palace]], was again closed to motor vehicles all day (between 09:30 and 16:30) and open to cycles. Local 'hubs' at the [[Emirates Stadium]] in Islington, Victoria Park, Clapham Common and Ravenscourt Park provided meeting points and guided rides to the event.<ref>[http://www.lcc.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=902 London Cycling Campaign]</ref>

=== 2007 (The Hovis London Freewheel) ===
The inaugural 'Hovis London Freewheel' was developed by the [[Mayor of London]] and [[Transport for London]] (TfL) to encourage and increase cycling participation, and promote cycling as a form of transport within London. The event was launched at City Hall on 26 June 2007 by the Mayor, [[Ken Livingstone]], [[Konnie Huq]] and Tim Dewey, Marketing Director for the event's sponsor [[Hovis]]. Hovis contributed <U+00A3>300,000<ref name=Guardian2008/> out of the total <U+00A3>600,000 raised in commercial sponsorship and support.<ref name=Mayor2185>[http://www.london.gov.uk/assembly/assemmtgs/2008/mqtoct15/minutes/written_answers.pdf Written answers] nos. 2185 and 2186 of 2008, London Mayor's Question Time, 15 October 2008</ref>

The event took place on Sunday 23 September 2007. In 2007, a 14km route around central London from [[London Bridge]] to St James's Park was closed to motorised traffic, allowing cyclists to take over the streets and enjoy London<U+2019>s most iconic sights. The route took participants past a number of landmarks including the [[London Eye]], [[Victoria Embankment]], [[Westminster]], [[Whitehall]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], and [[The Mall, London|The Mall]]. The event was designed for 30,000 cyclists but over 50,000 took part.<ref name=ES240108/>

As part of the day<U+2019>s cycling experience, there were six <U+2018>Freewheel Hubs' across London where riders gathered to be led by experienced cyclists onto the vehicle-free route. The six borough <U+2018>Freewheel Hubs<U+2019> at [[Gladstone Park, London|Gladstone Park]] - [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]], [[Finsbury Park]] - [[Haringey]], [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]] - [[Tower Hamlets]], [[Peckham Rye]] - [[Southwark]], [[Clapham Common]] <U+2013> [[Wandsworth]], [[Ravenscourt Park]] <U+2013> [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham|Hammersmith and Fulham]], also offered the chance to have bikes checked by experts.

London Freewheelers could also take part in the Freewheel Festival, an event at [[St James's Park]] open to all participants and visitors. Highlights of the festival included a Hovis picnic, BMX, mountain and trial bike stunts, cycling acrobatics, and bike displays along with children<U+2019>s activities and information on cycling in London.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7009034.stm Cyclists enjoy car ban in London], BBC, 23 September 2007.</ref>
