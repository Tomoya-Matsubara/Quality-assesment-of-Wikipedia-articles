'''Margarete Steiff''' (July 24, 1847 - May 9, 1909),  was a [[Sewing|seamstress]] who in 1880 founded [[Margarete Steiff GmbH]], making [[toy]] [[stuffed animal]]s.

Born in [[Giengen]], [[Germany]] she used a [[wheelchair]], due to [[polio]] she contracted as a baby. She started making stuffed animals as a hobby.

These toys began as elephants, which were originally a design Steiff found in a magazine and originally sold as [[pincushion]]s to her friends. However, children began playing with them, and in the years following she went on to design many other successful animal-themed toys for children, such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[pig]]s. She designed and made most of the [[prototype]]s herself.

She died of [[pneumonia]] in Giengen.
