'''''Grand Theft Auto IV'''''<!-- Please don't add the abbreviation "GTA IV" here as it isn't used throughout the article and therefore isn't needed --> is an [[open world]] [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] developed by [[Rockstar North]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released on 29 April 2008 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is the eleventh title in the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], and the first main entry since 2004's ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''. Set within the fictional [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]] (based on [[New York City]]), the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story follows a war veteran, [[Niko Bellic]] and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands.

The game is played from a [[Third-person view|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.{{efn|name="MultiPC"|The [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode for the Windows version of the game allows up to 32 players, while the console versions only allow up to 16 players.<ref name="GameSpot PC Review"/>}} Two [[expansion pack]]s were later released as [[downloadable content]] for the game, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]'', which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' storyline, and follow new protagonists.

Development began in 2004, soon after the release of ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas''. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide.

Following its announcement in May 2006, ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' was widely anticipated.<ref name="Anticipated"/> It was acclaimed by many reviewers, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. The game also [[Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto IV|generated controversy]], with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to [[Driving under the influence|drive under the influence of alcohol]]. ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] of video games, and by many critics as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', was released in September 2013.

== Gameplay ==
''Grand Theft Auto IV'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]].<ref>Marbles, Mr. "Wanted" in Gamepro Magazine p. 52 (October 2007)</ref> Players complete missions<U+2014>linear scenarios with set objectives<U+2014>to progress through the story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Composed of the fictional city of [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]], the world of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' is larger in area than most earlier entries in the series. At the beginning of the game, players can only explore the first island<U+2013>composed of Dukes and Broker<U+2013>with all other islands unlocking as the story progresses.<ref name="The Cousins Bellic"/>

Players use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the game's world. There is a [[first-person perspective]] option when using vehicles. In combat, [[auto-aim]] and a [[cover system]] can be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated using multiple techniques, such as eating, using medical kits, or calling for paramedics.<ref>{{cite web |last= Robinson |first= Martin |title= Grand Theft Auto IV UK Hands-On |publisher=[[IGN]].

On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name="cundy">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/how-gta-iv-will-reshape-the-series/ |title=How GTA IV will reshape the series |accessdate=26 July 2007|last=Cundy|first=Matt|date=26 July 2007|publisher=GamesRadar}}</ref>

[[File:Grand Theft Auto IV gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' was reworked to include a [[cover system]].|alt=The player character positioned in cover behind a vehicle, preparing to shoot at police officers on the other side of the vehicle.]]
The game's cover system allows players to deftly move between cover, to [[Blindfire|fire blindly]], aim freely, and target a specific enemy. Individual body parts can also be targeted.<ref name="IGNprev">{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2008/02/28/grand-theft-auto-iv-hands-on-2?page=2 |title=Grand Theft Auto IV hands-on preview |last1=Greg |first1=Miller |last2=Goldstein |first2=Hilary |date=1 March 2008 |publisher=IGN}}</ref> Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital.<ref>{{cite web| last = Robinson  | first = Martin  |title = Grand Theft Auto IV UK Hands-On | publisher = IGN | date = 28 February 2008 | url = http://au.ign.com/articles/2008/02/28/grand-theft-auto-iv-uk-hands-on-2  | accessdate =4 March 2008 }}</ref>

The game's single-player mode lets players control a former veteran <U+2013> [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Niko Bellic]]. During the story, Niko meets various new characters, many of which he befriends. These characters can then perform favours for Niko whenever he asks; for example, his cousin [[Roman Bellic|Roman]], who owns a taxi service, can send one of his [[Taxicab|cab]]s to Niko and take him to any destination around the city. Cabs are always available during gameplay, allowing players to quickly travel to a destination. Throughout the course of the game, players are also faced with [[morality]] choices, which alter the storyline appropriately depending on the player's choice. While free roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as [[bowling]] or [[darts]]. Other available activities include a [[vigilante]] minigame, and in-game television programming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/23/grand-theft-auto-iv-update |title=Grand Theft Auto IV Update |last=Roper |first=Chris |publisher=[[IGN]].

''Grand Theft Auto IV'' takes place in 2008, in a redesigned version of [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]] consisting of four boroughs, based on four of the boroughs of New York City: Broker (based on [[Brooklyn]]), Dukes ([[Queens]]), Bohan ([[The Bronx]]), and Algonquin ([[Manhattan]]).<ref name="Liberty NY" >{{cite news |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1955256/Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-Photos-reveal-similarities-between-Liberty-City-and-New-York-City.html |title = Grand Theft Auto IV: Photos reveal similarities between Liberty City and New York City |accessdate = 12 November 2008 |author = Moore, Matthew |date = 14 May 2008 |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' | location=London}}</ref> Adjacent to the city is the independent state of ''Alderney'' (Northern [[New Jersey]]). There are three minor islands present in the game: Charge Island ([[Randall's Island]]), Colony Island ([[Roosevelt Island]]), and Happiness Island ([[Liberty Island]]).

{{See also|List of Grand Theft Auto IV characters}}
In Liberty City, [[Niko Bellic]], an [[Eastern Europe]]an,<ref name="egmmarch">{{cite journal | author = Crispin Boyer |date=March 2008  | title = Sweet Land of Liberty | journal = Electronic Gaming Monthly | pages = 44<U+2013>56 }} '''[[Sam Houser]]''': "He's from that gray part of broken-down Eastern Europe, a war-torn area."</ref> arrives to meet his cousin [[Roman Bellic|Roman]]. Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the [[American Dream]], and to search for the man who betrayed his unit in a war fifteen years prior. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loan sharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.<ref name="The Cousins Bellic"/>

Niko defends Roman from his loan sharks several times, eventually killing [[List of Grand Theft Auto IV characters#Vlad Glebov|Vlad Glebov]], Roman's Russian loan shark. Niko was forced to work for Vlad due to Roman's debts but ended up killing him after learning that that he had slept with Roman's girlfriend, Mallorie.<ref name="Uncle Vlad"/> After Vlad's murder, Niko and Roman are kidnapped by members of the Liberty City [[Russian mafia|Bratva]] on order of [[Mikhail Faustin]] and his associate, [[Dimitri Rascalov]]. Faustin, not bothered by the murder of Vlad, hires Niko.<ref name="Crime and Punishment"/> Niko quickly learns that Faustin is a psychopath when he orders him to kill the son of Kenny Petrovi<U+0107>, the most powerful man in the Liberty City Bratva. After the Petrovi<U+0107> family threatens retaliation, Dimitri orders Niko to assassinate Faustin.<ref name="The Master and the Molotov"/> When Niko meets with Dimitri to collect on the assassination, Dimitri betrays him; when they meet, Dimitri brings Niko's former employer Ray Bulgarin, who accuses Niko of stealing from him. When Niko truthfully denies the allegation, a firefight ensues, allowing Dimitri and Bulgarin to escape.<ref name="Russian Revolution"/>

Immediately afterwards, Niko and Roman are forced to escape to Bohan when their apartment and taxi company are destroyed in arson attacks by Dimitri's men.<ref name="Roman's Sorrow"/> However, things go poorly in Bohan: Dimitri's men kidnap Roman in a failed bid to ambush and kill Niko, who rescues Roman.<ref name="Hostile Negotiation"/> Furthermore, one of the drug deals that Niko works on turns out to be a [[Sting operation|sting]]<ref name="Blow Your Cover"/> and another is busted. After the latter incident, Niko's current girlfriend [[List of Grand Theft Auto IV characters#Michelle/Karen|Michelle]] then reveals that she works for a government agency and [[Entrapment|entraps]] Niko into working for her agency, known only by its cover: [[List of Grand Theft Auto IV characters#United Liberty Paper|United Liberty Paper]].<ref name="The Snow Storm"/> Niko kills several known or suspected terrorists for the agency in exchange for the file of the numerous crimes the police have on him and the promise of assistance in finding the traitor of his unit.<ref name="Wrong is Right"/><ref name="Portrait of a Killer"/><ref name="Paper Trail"/>

With the assistance of United Liberty Paper, Niko eventually tracks down the man responsible for his unit's betrayal: [[List of Grand Theft Auto IV characters#Darko Brevic|Darko Brevic]]; Niko chooses Darko's fate.<ref name="That Special Someone"/> Having dealt with his past, Niko is summoned by [[Pegorino crime family|Jimmy Pegorino]], who demands one final favour after many favours: to help with an extremely lucrative deal on heroin in collusion with Dimitri Rascalov.<ref name="One Last Thing"/>

Niko is then faced with two choices: strike a deal with Dimitri, or seek revenge on him.<ref name="One Last Thing"/> Should Niko go through with the deal, he soon finds out that Dimitri took the heroin for himself, which endangers and angers Niko.<ref name="If the Price is Right"/> At Roman's wedding, an assassin sent by Dimitri kills Roman with a stray bullet as Niko disarms and kills him.<ref name="Mr and Mrs Bellic"/> A devastated and vengeful Niko later tracks down Dimitri and Pegorino, witnesses the former kill the latter, before chasing and killing Dimitri.<ref name="The Revenger's Tragedy"/> Should Niko choose to exact revenge, Niko ambushes and executes Dimitri.<ref name="A Dish Served Cold"/> At Roman's wedding, Pegorino, furious after Niko's betrayal, commits a [[drive-by shooting]]. He targets Niko, but ends up killing Niko's girlfriend [[List of Grand Theft Auto IV characters#Kate McReary|Kate]].<ref name="Mr and Mrs Bellic"/> Niko soon tracks down, chases, and kills Pegorino, who had become hated and targeted by the entire underworld of Liberty City.<ref name="Out of Commission"/>

''Grand Theft Auto IV'' sees a shift in the series to a more realistic and detailed style and tone,<ref name="OPM UK June 2007" /> partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered [[High-definition television|high-definition]] graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles.<ref name="fritz" /> Rockstar co-founder [[Dan Houser]] said "what we're taking as our watchword on [''Grand Theft Auto IV''] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had."<ref name="OPM UK June 2007" /> Art director Aaron Garbut said one of the reasons they decided to set the game in New York because "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," and since they were hoping the push the "detail, variety and life" to a high level, it seemed that "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit."<ref name="ign">{{cite web|url = http://ign.com/articles/2008/03/29/gta-iv-building-a-brave-new-world |title = GTA IV: Building a Brave New World |accessdate = 28 April 2008 |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary |date = 28 March 2008 |publisher = IGN }}</ref> Dan Houser added "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold."<ref name="fritz" /> The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City, Dan Houser said "what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective."<ref name="OPM UK June 2007" /> The ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series<ref name="slab">{{cite web|url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/news/200705/101_p1.asp|title=Welcome to Grand Theft Auto IV| author=Doree, Adam|work=[[Kikizo]]|date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=27 September 2013 }}</ref> Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for ''Grand Theft Auto IV'''s predecessor ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" are taken into account.<ref name="slab" /> The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas.<ref name="OPM UK June 2007" /> To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one at the start of the project (which was done with every previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' game) and another smaller one further into development.<ref name="ign" /> A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.<ref name="fritz" />

The story of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' was written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries.<ref name="gtaiv">{{cite video game | title = Grand Theft Auto IV | developer = [[Rockstar North]] | publisher = [[Rockstar Games]] | date = 29 April 2008 }}</ref> Unlike previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence, "[''Grand Theft Auto IV'' doesn't] really have any cinematic influences",<ref name="OPM UK June 2007" /> as explained by Houser. "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't to try and do a loving tribute or reference other stuff. It's to reference the actual place itself".<ref name="fritz" /> Houser also said, "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [a] movie. [...] Maybe [we] could do something ourselves that would live alongside that stuff".<ref name="fritz" />

Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich said "[we had] to pick the songs that make New York today what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated by the time the game comes out."<ref>{{cite news |url = http://variety.com/2008/digital/news/grand-theft-music-a-phone-call-away-1117984286/ |title = 'Grand Theft' music a phone call away |accessdate = 18 May 2008 |last=Fritz |first=Ben |date = 18 April 2008 |publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' }}</ref> The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights.<ref name="musicman">{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1586708/20080501/id_0.jhtml |title = 'Grand Theft Auto IV' Music Man Explains How Those 214 Songs Made The Soundtrack |accessdate = 18 May 2008 |last=Totilo |first=Stephen |date = 2 May 2008 |publisher = MTV News }}</ref> They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member [[Sean Delaney (KISS)|Sean Delaney]] to license the band's song, "Walk the Night".<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/05/05/us-grandtheft-idUSN0430077120080505 |title = "Grand Theft Auto" simplifies song purchasing |accessdate = 18 May 2008 |last=Bruno |first=Antony |date = 5 May 2008 |publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' }}</ref> Citing sources close to the deals, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track.<ref name="crimepays">{{cite news |url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/04/26/us-grandtheft-idUSN2540948020080426 |title = Crime pays for music biz with new Grand Theft Auto |accessdate = 18 May 2008 |last=Bruno |first=Antony |date = 26 April 2008 |publisher = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' }}</ref> Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by going to an in-game [[record shop]] and for Niko to have an [[Digital audio player|MP3 player]], but both ideas were cut.<ref name="musicman" /> [[DJ Green Lantern]] produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7.<ref name="crimepays" /> Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, went through the extra effort of flying to [[Jamaica]] to get [[dancehall]] artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City.<ref name="crimepays" />

{{Main|Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto IV}}

Prior to and since the release of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', the game had been subject to a great deal of controversy, as was the case with previous ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' titles. Figures including [[George Galloway]], [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] have criticised the game, as have organisations including New York City officials and [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/mothers-against-gtaivs-drunk-driving/1100-6190213/ |title=Mothers against GTAIV's drunk driving|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan |date=30 April 2008|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> MADD asked ESRB to change the rating of the game from "M" (for ages seventeen and up) to "AO" (for adults only) due to the player's ability to [[Driving under the influence|drive under the influence]] of alcohol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.madd.org/Media-Center/Media-Center/Press-Releases/Press-Releases/2008/MADD<U+2019>s-Statement-Regarding-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV.aspx |title=MADD's Statement Regarding Grand Theft Auto IV |last=Tway |first=Kelley |publisher=[[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080513021529/http://www.madd.org/Media-Center/Media-Center/Press-Releases/Press-Releases/2008/MADD%E2%80%99s-Statement-Regarding-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2008 |accessdate=27 September 2013 }}</ref>

The version of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' released in Australia and New Zealand was edited to remove content to allow the game to meet the requirements of [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|the Australian classification system]].<ref name="smh-censor">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.smh.com.au/screenplay/archives/017808.html |title=GTA IV edited for Australia |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Hill |first=Jason |date=4 April 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> However, the game was resubmitted to the New Zealand [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)|OFLC]] by Stan Calif, a 21-year-old student who was unhappy that New Zealand received an edited version of the game as a result of Australian censorship laws. The unedited version was subsequently given an R18 rating and cleared for sale in New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/entertainment/uncut-version-of-grand-theft-auto-iv-now-available-in-nz-2008052218 |title=Uncut version of Grand Theft Auto IV now available in NZ |work=[[3 News]] |publisher=[[MediaWorks New Zealand|MediaWorks]] |date=22 May 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2014 }}</ref> The PC version of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' released in Australia is reported to be unedited, identical to that of other international releases, under the MA15+ rating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5100659/for-some-reason-australia-is-getting-an-uncut-gta-iv-on-pc |title=For Some Reason, Australia Is Getting An Uncut GTA IV On PC |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |date=2 December 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2014 }}</ref>

There have been reports in the United Kingdom and the United States of crimes perpetrated against people purchasing ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', as well as employees of stores selling the game.<ref name="Crime incidents"/> One of these incidents, an attack near a [[Gamestation]] store in [[Croydon]], [[London]] was later reported to be an unrelated argument between two groups of people leaving a pub<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/croydon-stabbing-had-nothing-to-do-with-gta |title=Croydon stabbing 'had nothing to do with GTA<U+2019>|last=Ingham|first=Tim |date=30 April 2008|publisher=[[Market for Home Computing and Video Games]]|accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref> and the story has been referred to as a "[[moral panic|media panic]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2007890/grand-theft-auto-stabbing-disputed |title=Grand Theft Auto stabbing disputed |last=Thomson |first=Iain |publisher=V3 |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2008 |registration=yes}}</ref> Six teenagers were later arrested in June 2008 after engaging in a crime spree in [[New Hyde Park (village), New York|New Hyde Park]], New York, assaulting and robbing several people, and attempting a [[carjacking]].
