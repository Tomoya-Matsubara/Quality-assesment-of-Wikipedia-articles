===Alan Partridge===
{{main|Alan Partridge}}
While working with [[Armando Iannucci]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] on the [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] comedy ''[[On the Hour]]'', Coogan conceived his most popular and developed character, a socially awkward and politically incorrect regional media personality. He appeared as a sports presenter on the [[television comedy]] ''[[The Day Today]]'', before hosting his own [[Talk show|chat show]], ''[[Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge (TV series)|Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge]]''. In 1997, Partridge returned in the [[sitcom]] ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'', which was followed by a second series in 2002, and received five [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations. Partridge featured in Coogan's 2008 stand-up tour.

He revisited the character in two one-off [[Sky Atlantic]] specials, including ''[[Alan Partridge: Welcome to the Places of My Life]]'', which received a further two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] nominations, as well as the [[mockumentary]] ''[[Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge]]'', which has been renewed for a second season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/13/alan-partridge-sky-atlantic|title=Alan Partridge to return in second Sky Atlantic series|publisher=The Guardian|author=Josh Halliday|accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref> A feature-length film, ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'', was released in 2013.<ref name="Seb Patrick"/>

===TV roles===
Paul Calf first began as a character named 'Duncan Disorderly' in Coogan's early stand-up routines. Calf first came to wider public notice in 1993, with several appearances on ''[[Saturday Zoo]]'', a late-night variety show presented by [[Jonathan Ross]] on Channel 4. Paul has appeared in two video diaries, an episode of ''[[Coogan's Run]]'', and in various stand-up performances. He is an unemployed [[Manchester|Mancunian]] wastrel with a particular hatred of students. His catchphrase is "Bag o' [[shit]]e". Paul lives in a [[council house]] in the fictional town of Ottle with his mother and his sister, Pauline Calf (also played by Coogan). His father, Pete Calf (played by Coogan in Coogan's Run) died some time before the first video diary was made. For a long time he was obsessed with getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, Julie. Paul's best friend is "Fat" Bob (played by [[John Thomson (comedian)|John Thomson]]), a car mechanic who eventually married Pauline. Paul supports [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and is very partial to [[Wagon Wheels]]. He wears [[Burton (clothing)|Burton]] suits, sports a bleached [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] and drives a [[Ford Cortina]].

===Stand-up comedy comeback tour===
In March 2008, it was confirmed that Coogan would return to doing stand-up comedy as part of his first stand-up tour in ten years. The tour, named "Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge and other less successful characters", saw the return of some of his old characters including Paul Calf and Alan Partridge.<ref name="coogans-run1">{{cite web|url=http://www.coogans-run.co.uk/h/steve-coogan-newsitem.php?id=703|title=First live dates in a decade|publisher=Coogans-run.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> Reviews of the opening night were mixed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Steve-Coogan-fails-sparkle/article-370087-detail/article.html|title=Steve Coogan fails to sparkle|publisher=Thisisstaffordshire.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref> and such reviews continued as the tour progressed.<ref name=Liverpool>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/10/16/nothing-to-laugh-at-for-steve-coogan-s-angry-fans-64375-22045908/|title=Nothing to laugh at for Steve Coogan's angry fans|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/alan-partridges-less-successful-show-964292.html|title=Alan Partridge's less successful show|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2 November 2008|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Brown|date=17 October 2008}}</ref> Much of the criticism focused on the apparent unrehearsed quality of some of the performances and nervous stage presence of Coogan's. Chortle comedy guide wrote "Steve Coogan<U+2019>s stage comeback after ten years is most definitely a show of two halves: the superlative Alan Partridge plus a collection of characters that are not only less successful, but woefully less funny."<ref name=Bennett-10-08>{{cite web|last=Bennett|first=Steve|title=Steve Coogan As Alan Partridge And Other Less Successful Characters|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/shows/tour/s/15969/steve_coogan_as_alan_partridge_and_other_less_successful_characters/review?id_review=15969|work=Chortle comedy review October 2008|publisher=Chortle|accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref>

===Production work===
Coogan, along with his writing partner [[Henry Normal]], founded [[Baby Cow Productions]] in 1999. Together, they have served as executive producers for shows such as ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]'', ''[[Nighty Night]]'', ''[[Marion and Geoff]]'', ''[[Gavin and Stacey]]'', ''[[Human Remains (TV series)|Human Remains]]'' and ''[[Moone Boy]]'', as well as the [[Alan Partridge]] feature film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]''. They have also produced ''Where Are the Joneses'', an online sitcom which uses [[wiki]] technology to allow the audience to upload scripts and storyline ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wherearethejoneses.com |title=Where are the Joneses? |publisher=Wherearethejoneses.com|accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref>

==In the media==
Coogan said he "liked to keep himself private", adding; "I have never wanted to be famous, as such <U+2013> fame is a by-product".<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Coogan tells press standards inquiry he 'never signed away privacy'|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1465855_steve-coogan-tells-press-standards-inquiry-he-never-signed-away-privacy|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Manchester Evening News|date=22 November 2011}}</ref>
He has been a popular target of the [[British tabloid]] [[News media|press]] since 1996, who he stated have subjected him to [[entrapment]] and [[blackmail]], printed obvious [[lie|falsehoods]] about him,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4172666.stm|title=Love and Coogan deny baby claim|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 November 2008| date=22 August 2005}}</ref> also targeting his family and friends in attempts to extract stories from them.<ref name="Leveson statement-23-11-2011">{{cite news|title=Steve Coogan's witness statement to the Leveson inquiry <U+2013> full text|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/interactive/2011/nov/23/steve-coogan-witness-statement-leveson-inquiry|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 November 2011|location=London}}</ref>

Coogan in some cases gave a strong denial to allegations, but in others did not contest them because he wanted to shield vulnerable friends from adverse publicity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Coogan <U+2013> Steve Coogan Tried To Protect 'Vulnerable' Owen Wilson|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/steve-coogan-tried-to-protect-vulnerable-owen-wilson_1264687|work=Contact music, 22 November 2011|publisher=Contactmusic.com Ltd|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>
The tabloids also published intrusive information about his relationships and the schooling of his child. Coogan has also been critical of the [[broadsheet]] press, saying they have colluded with the tabloids in the interests of selling newspapers. In 2005 he said "''The Guardian'' tends to have its cake and eat it.

Coogan said that because of the persistent intrusion into his private life, the press had effectively made him "immune" to further attack, as his "closet is empty of skeletons".<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Coogan gives evidence to Leveson Inquiry into media ethics|url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/pg/news/suchsmallportions/read/38613/steve-coogan-gives-evidence-to-levenson-inquiry-into-media-ethics|work=Such small portions the comedy digest|publisher=such.small.portions 2011|accessdate=24 November 2011}}</ref>

===Phone hacking===
{{Main|News of the World phone hacking affair}}
Coogan became a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal as one of the celebrities who took action against the British tabloids in light of these events. He was made aware by his [[Telecommunications service provider|phone service provider]] of "possible anomalies" on his phone in 2005 and 2006.<ref name=Milmo-15-02-2011>{{cite news|last=Milmo|first=Cahal|title=Phone hackers targeted treasure trove of information, says Coogan|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/phone-hackers-targeted-treasure-trove-of-information-says-coogan-2215050.html|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 February 2011|location=London}}</ref> In 2010, Coogan's legal firm obtained a partially [[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] version of [[Glenn Mulcaire|Glenn Mulcaire's]] [[phone hacking|hacking]] notebook by a [[court order]] which showed Coogan had been targeted and his personal information was in the possession of Mulcaire.

Mulcaire was forced by the [[High Court of Justice]] to disclose to Coogan's legal team who amongst the staff at the ''[[News of the World]]'' ordered him to hack phones. This information was obtained by Coogan's lawyers on 26 August 2011.<ref name=Chandrasekhar-10-11-2011>{{cite news|last=Chandrasekhar|first=Indu|title=Phone hacking: timeline of the scandal|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8634176/Phone-hacking-timeline-of-a-scandal.html#2011|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=10 November 2011|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}</ref>
Interviewed on ''[[Newsnight]]'' on 8 July 2011, Coogan said he was "delighted" by the closure of the News of the World and said it was a "fantastic day for journalism". He said the idea of press freedom was used by the tabloids as a "smokescreen for selling papers with tittle-tattle" and said the argument against press regulation was "[[moral bankruptcy|morally bankrupt]]"<ref name=Youtube-8-07-2011/>

Coogan provided an 8-page witness statement to the [[Leveson Inquiry]] and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence.<ref name="Leveson statement-23-11-2011"/> He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who felt they could not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite news|title='This is not the Steve Coogan and Hugh Grant show'|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/people-news/leveson-inquiry/42898/not-steve-coogan-and-hugh-grant-show|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=The Week|date=22 November 2011}}</ref>
