==Geography==
===Location===

Lviv is on the verge of the [[Roztocze|Roztochia Upland]], about 70km from the [[Poland|Polish]] border and about 160km (100 miles) from the eastern [[Carpathian Mountains]]. Lviv's altitude averages 296m above [[sea level]], although it has many hills. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409m above sea level. This has a commanding view of the historic city center with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.

The old walled city was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the river [[Poltva River|Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, it was covered in areas where it flows through the city. The central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') runs right above the river and the famous [[Lviv Opera and Ballet Theater|Opera House]].

===Climate===

Lviv's climate is moderate [[Continental climate|continental]]. The average temperatures are <U+2212>4<U+00B0>C (27<U+00B0>F) in January and +18<U+00B0>C (65 <U+00B0>F) in June. Average annual rainfall is 660mm (26 inches), with a notable deficit in summer. Cloud coverage averages 66 days per year.

==History==
{{main|History of Lviv}}
[[Image:Lw<U+00F3>w - Rynek 01.JPG|thumb|230px|Market square of Lviv.]]

Lviv was founded by [[Danylo of Halych|King Danylo Halytskiy]] of the [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] principality of [[Halych-Volhynia]], and named in honor of his son, [[Leo I of Halych|Lev]]. When Danylo died Lev made Lviv the capital of Halich-Volhynia.{{Fact|date=March 2007}} The city is first mentioned in [[Halych-Volhynian Chronicle]] from 1256. It was captured by Poland in 1349 and, in 1356, [[Casimir III of Poland]] brought in German burghers and granted the [[Magdeburg rights]] which implied that all city matters were to be resolved by a council, elected by the wealthy citizens. The city council seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. As part of [[Poland]] (and later the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]), Lviv became the capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]].  

As Lviv prospered, it became religiously and ethnically diverse. The 17th century brought invading armies of [[Sweden|Swedes]] and [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] to its gates. In 1772, following the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city known as ''Lemberg'' became the capital of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. It was captured by the Russian army in September 1914 but retaken by [[Austria-Hungary]] in June the following year. 

With the collapse of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] at the end of World War I, Lviv became an arena of conflict between the local Ukrainian and Polish populations. Between the World Wars, it was the third largest Polish city (after [[Warsaw]] and [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]])) and the seat of the [[Lw<U+00F3>w Voivodeship]]. Lviv and its population suffered greatly from the two world wars and the [[Holocaust]]. It remains today one of the main centres of Ukrainian culture and the origin of much of the nation's political class.

==Government==
[[Image:Lw<U+00F3>w - Ratusz.jpg|thumb|230px|Lviv city hall.]]
===Administrative division===

Lviv is divided into six [[raion]]s ([[district]]s), each with its own administrative bodies:

* Halytskyi (''<U+0413><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+0446><U+044C><U+043A><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0440><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+043D>'')

==Transport==
[[Image:Marshroutky.jpg|thumb|230px|The so-called [[marshrutka]], a small private bus, in a street of Lviv.]]
[[Image:Lviv green tram.jpg|thumb|230px|A [[Lviv tram]] on a small [[cobblestone]] sidestreet in the Old Town.]]
[[Image:LwowDworzec.JPG|thumb|230px|Lviv's [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Main Railway Terminal]], an [[Art Nouveau]] style construction built in 1903 by [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Sad<U+0142>owski]].]]
===Buses===

The public bus network is not well-developed:  it has few lines. A cheap alternative are the [[marshrutka|marshrutki]], small private buses which go where the city buses do not. Marshrutki have no fixed stops or timetable but are cheaper (1 [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]] <U+2248>20[[Cent (United States coin)|US cents]]) and fast. The marshrutki also run on suburban lines to most nearby towns e.g. to Shehyni at the [[Poland|Polish]] border.

===Tramways===
{{main|Lviv tram}}

The first [[tram]]way lines were opened on 5th May 1880 and the last horse-powered line was electrified on 31st May 1894. In 1922, the tramways were switched to a right-hand-side system. After [[World War II]] and the annexation of the city by the [[Soviet Union]], several lines were closed but most of infrastructure was preserved.

The Lviv tramway now runs about 220 cars on 75km of track, most of which is in very poor condition.  The trams are in fair condition but can be very full during rush hours. A ticket for one journey (any distance) costs 1 hryvnia(<U+2248>20 US cents / 8 Eurocents).

===Trolleybuses===

After the war and expulsion of most of the population, the city grew rapidly, due to evacuees returning from [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Government's vigorous development of heavy industry.  This included transfer of entire factories from the Urals and other distant places to the newly "freed" (''acquired'') territories of the USSR, including Lviv.

The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27th November 1952. Later, new lines were opened to the blocks of flats at the city outskirts. The network now runs 200 trolleybuses, mostly of the 1960s 14Tr type.

===Railway===

Modern Lviv remains a hub on which nine railways converge, providing local and international services. Several trains cross the nearby Polish-Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy<U+015B>l]]) e.g. the luxurious [[Kiev]]-[[Krak<U+00F3>w]] link. There are good connections to [[Slovakia]] ([[Ko<U+0161>ice]]) and [[Hungary]] ([[Budapest]]). By western standards, the trains are slow but cheap.  A journey to the western border with [[Hungary]] or [[Slovakia]] (several hundred kilometres) costs a few euros/dollars.  Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments.

===Airport===

[[Lviv International Airport]] (LWO)<ref>See also: [http://www.avia.lviv.ua/ Lviv International Airport official website]</ref> is 6km from the city centre.

Since 1998, the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] lists [[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic center]] as part of "World Heritage."  UNESCO gave the following reasons<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/865 L'viv <U+2013> the Ensemble of the Historic Centre], UNESCO - World Heritage. URL Accessed: 30 October 2006</ref> for its selection:

{{quote|Criterion II: In its urban fabric and its architecture, Lviv is an outstanding example of the fusion of the architectural and artistic traditions of eastern Europe with those of Italy and Germany.}}

{{quote|Criterion V: The political and commercial role of Lviv attracted to it a number of ethnic groups with different cultural and religious traditions, who established separate yet interdependent communities within the city, evidence for which is still discernible in the modern townscape.}}

===Architecture===

Lviv's historic churches, buildings and relics date from the 13th century. In recent centuries, it was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other Ukrainian cities. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. After the fires of 1527 and 1556, Lviv lost most of its [[Gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings, but it retains many buildings in [[Renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[Baroque architecture|baroque]], and [[Classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]], and [[Art Deco]].

The buildings have many stone carvings and sculptures.  The remains of ancient castles and old churches dot the central cityscape.  Some 3-5 story buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottos in various states of repair. The fine carving on large doors, hundreds of years old, attracts the attention of passers-by. Some cemeteries are of interest and some visitors from nearby countries come specifically to see the [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]]. Leaving the central area, the architectural style changes radically as [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era high rises dominate.  In the centre, the Soviet era is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.

Lviv is the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and (until 21st August 2005) was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35% of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5% to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9% to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6% to the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Until 2005, Lviv was the only city with two [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s: [[Lubomyr Cardinal Husar|Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|UGCC]]) and [[Marian Cardinal Jaworski|Marian Jaworski]] ([[Roman Catholic Church|RCC]]).

In June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral in Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]], and the [[Armenian Cathedral in Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].

It is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]].

===Museums and art galleries===

The most notable of the museums and art galleries are the [[National Gallery of Lviv|National Gallery]], the Museum of Religion (formerly the Museum of Atheism) and the National Museum (formerly the Museum of Industry). 

===Sports===
Lviv was an important centre for sport in [[Central Europe]] and it is regarded as the cradle of Polish football. First known official goal in a football match in Poland was scored there on July 14, [[1894]], during the Lviv - [[Krakow]] game. The goal was scored by Wlodzimierz Chomicki, who represented the team of Lviv. Also, Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published in [[1904]] first rules of football translated into Polish, another person from Lviv, Stanislaw Polakiewicz, became in [[1911]] first officially recognised Polish referee. In [[1911]] in Lviv first Polish Football Federation was founded.

The first Polish professional [[football (soccer)|football]] club, [[Czarni Lw<U+00F3>w]], opened in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogon, in 1913. Another Lviv's side, [[Pogon Lwow]], was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In late 1920s, as many as four teams from Lviv played in the Polish Football League (Pogon, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). Several notable figures of Polish football come from this city, including [[Kazimierz Gorski]], [[Ryszard Koncewicz]], [[Michal Matyas]] and [[Waclaw Kuchar]].

Lviv also is the Polish cradle of other sports. In January of [[1905]] first Polish ice-hockey match took place there, two years later first ski-jumping competition was organized in nearby [[Slawsko]], in the same year first Polish basketball games were organized in Lviv's gymnasiums. Several years earlier, in the fall of [[1887]], in a gym hall by Lyczakowska Street, first Polish track and field competition took place, with such sports as long jump and high jump. Lviv's athlete [[Wladyslaw Ponurski]] represented [[Austria]] in the [[1912 Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]]. Furthermore, on July 9, [[1922]], first official [[Rugby union|rugby]] game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogon Lwow, in which the rugby team of Orzel Bialy Lwow divided itself into two teams - "The Reds" and "The Blacks". Referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.

Lviv now has several major professional football clubs and some smaller clubs. [[FC Karpaty Lviv]], founded in 1963, plays in the first division of [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Sometimes, the youth of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer an outdoor broadcast of a game.

Lviv's [[Ukraina Stadium]] is to be renovated and will host three group matches during [[EURO 2012]].

===Music===

Lviv is the hometown of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] 2004 winner [[Ruslana]], who has since become very popular in Europe.

===Films and books featuring Lviv===

Portions of [[Schindler's List]] were shot in the city centre, as this was less expensive than in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]].<!-- Could use a list of scenes -->

Some of the Austrian road-movie [[Blue Moon (2002 movie)|Blue Moon]] was shot in Lviv.

Parts of the movie and novel [[Everything Is Illuminated]] take place in Lviv.

Brian R.Banks' ''Muse & Messiah: The Life, Imagination & Legacy of Bruno Schulz (1892-1942)'' has several pages which discuss the history and cultural-social life of the Lviv region. The book includes a CD-ROM with many old and new photographs and the first English map of nearby [[Drohobych]].

==Economy==  
 
Lviv is one of the biggest cities in Ukraine and is growing rapidly.  It typifies a post-Soviet era developing city.  It has problems with infrastructure and pollution, including heavy downtown car pollution on weekdays, some local corruption and irregularities in water supply (especially hot water).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 
    
According to the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine, the [[List of Ukrainian oblasts and territories by salary|average salary]] in the [[Lviv Oblast]] is a little less than the average for Ukraine, which, in September 2006, was about 1000 [[Ukrainian hryvnia|UAH]] or roughly 200 [[United States dollar|USD]].
 
In 2006, Ukraine's [[Indices of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]] was rated at 3.24, where a rating 1.0 is "freer" than a rating 5.0. According to the World Bank classification, Lviv is a lower middle-income city.

There are many street vendors of food, books, clothes, traditional cultural items and tourist gifts. There are many restaurants and shops, some of which sell expensive western-made goods.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 

In an interesting mixture of the past and present, peasants from the countryside sell their goods beside a cellphone shop in a medieval building.

Banking and money trading are an important part of the economy, with many banks and exchange offices throughout the city.
