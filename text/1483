==Biography==
===Early life===
Pascu is a native of [[Agnita]] (at the time part of [[Bra<U+015F>ov Region]], now in [[Sibiu County]]), where he graduated from primary school. He was born to an [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] father and a half-[[Hungarian minority in Romania|Hungarian]] mother;<ref name="gyuartist">{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/gyuri-pascu-un-artist-de-succes-440583.html "Gyuri Pascu, un artist de succes" (interview with Ioan Gyuri Pascu)], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', April 29, 2007</ref><ref name="cpigp">{{ro icon}} Corina Pavel, [http://www.formula-as.ro/2007/786/lumea-romaneasca-24/ioan-gyuri-pascu-8315 "Ioan Gyuri Pascu" (interview)], in ''[[Formula As]]'', Nr. 786, September 2007</ref> on his mother's side, he is also the descendant of [[Polish minority in Romania|Poles]] and [[Slovaks of Romania|Slovaks]].<ref name="cpigp"/> His mother was a [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] and his father, like Gyuri, was a [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]].<ref name="cpigp"/> His name reflects his complex heritage: ''Ioan'' was chosen as his Romanian name; his second name was the Hungarian ''Gyurika'', but it was recorded as ''Ghiurico'' in his [[birth certificate]] and personal documents ever since<U+2014>as Pascu later indicated, this was because neither his father nor the notary were familiar with [[Hungarian phonology]].<ref name="gyuartist"/> Pascu, who is fluent in the [[Hungarian language]],<ref name="cpigp"/> prefers the [[hypocoristic]] ''Gyuri''.<ref name="gyuartist"/> 

Pascu began to study piano when he was nine years old, and sang [[soprano]] in his school choir, entertaining his friends with impressions of well-known pop singers.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs">{{ro icon}} [http://www.ioangyuripascu.ro/ Ioan Gyuri Pascu (official site)]; retrieved May 5, 2007</ref><ref name="pmdiver">{{ro icon}} Patricia Marinescu, "Ioan Gyuri Pascu s-ar <U+00EE>ntoarce la Divertis, dar nu face fa<U+0163><U+0103>", in ''[[Gardianul]]'', February 20, 2008</ref> During fifth grade, he started playing [[Team handball|handball]] with an amateur team, discarding piano lessons and contemplating a career in acting.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="pmdiver"/><ref name="igpmori">{{ro icon}} [http://life.hotnews.ro/stiri-showbiz-5872893-video-audio-ioan-gyuri-pascu-bine-cand-mori-atunci-devii-genial.htm ''Ioan Gyuri Pascu: E bine c<U+00E2>nd mori, c<U+0103> atunci devii genial''], [[HotNews.ro]], June 30, 2009</ref> He also taught himself [[guitar]].<ref name="igpmori"/>

At age fourteen, Pascu's voice changed. He was still a soprano in the choir, but had to use his [[head voice]].<ref name="pascuofs"/> As a high school student, Pascu had to enlist in the [[Union of Communist Youth]] (UTC), the [[Communist regime|Romanian communist regime]] compulsory youth organization.<ref name="pascuofs"/> In 1976, he enrolled at the Agnita High School, which later became the Agro-Industrial High School. The same year, he gave up handball and began a more formal study of guitar music, using the Maria Boeru textbook as his guide.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> He debuted as an amateur actor in 1977, with a school theater performance at the Agnita House of Culture.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/>

Pascu was also interested in the ''[[Cenaclul Flac<U+0103>ra]]'' concerts, an outlet for [[American folk music revival|American folk]]-inspired and [[folk rock]], tolerated under communism.<ref name="pascuofs"/> He became familiar with [[Western world|Western]] music acts such as [[Olivia Newton John]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and active in the UTC's cultural brigade, wrote and performed his first folk-rock numbers.<ref name="pascuofs"/>

===Trandafirii Negri and Fundal===
In May 1978, Pascu attended an [[International Workers' Day]] celebration in [[Media<U+015F>]], where he befriended brothers Septimiu and Horia Moldovan, who were in the same band as pop singer [[Elena C<U+00E2>rstea]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> According to Pascu's official site, they played Western rock hits for him, including [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Child in Time]]" and [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]'s "[[July Morning (song)|July Morning]]".<ref name="pascuofs"/> Between 1978 and 1980, Pascu sang with the Moldovans' band Trandafirii Negri, and was invited to perform with them at wedding parties and similar festivities.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> With the money he earned, he purchased his first [[acoustic guitar]] directly from the factory in [[Reghin]], and taught himself to play [[Drum kit|drums]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> He composed one of his first published songs, "Melancolie" ("Melancholy"), in 1979.<ref name="pascuofs"/> 

In 1980, Pascu applied for [[T<U+00E2>rgu Mure<U+015F>]]' [[Szentgy<U+00F6>rgy Istv<U+00E1>n Drama School]], but failed the entry exam.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="pmdiver"/> He worked in a state-owned factory as a [[lathe]] operator, and for several months in 1980, was conscripted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]],<ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="pmdiver"/> where he met other amateur musicians who were undergoing military training.

In 1982, their military term over, Pascu and Fundal returned to Media<U+015F>, where Pascu was discovered by [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company|Romanian Radio]]'s ''Radio Vacan<U+0163>a'' station.  He was invited to perform at the station's youth concerts, where he met and befriended [[Teo Peter]], bass player for [[Compact (Romanian band)|Compact]], and music promoter [[Andrei Parto<U+015F>]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> During 1982, Pascu also played ''Cenaclul Flac<U+0103>ra'' concerts, and was billed for the UTC's ''[[Sc<U+00EE>nteia|Sc<U+00EE>nteia Tineretului]]'' shows.<ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="pmdiver"/> He later described his mentoring by rock singers [[Cristi Minculescu]], [[Liviu Tudan]], [[Adi Ordean]] and [[Vladi Cnejevici]] as his "third real school".<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> In 1980, Pascu also discovered and became influenced by [[reggae]] music. He was introduced to the reggae style by [[The Police]] and its [[reggae fusion]] sessions, then became a fan of reggae numbers played by [[African diaspora]] students in Romanian universities.<ref name="vpjamaica">{{ro icon}} Victor Popescu, [http://old.cotidianul.ro/i_ve_never_been_to_jamaica_but_this_is_the_country_i_lika-72523.html " 'I've never been to Jamaica/But this is the country I lika' "], in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', February 5, 2009</ref> Twenty years later, Pascu told reporters: "Between 1980 and 1985, I was mad about [[Bob Marley]]."<ref name="vpjamaica"/>

===University years and ''Divertis'' debut===
In 1984, Pascu moved to [[Cluj-Napoca]], and was admitted into the [[Babe<U+015F>-Bolyai University|Cluj University]] Faculty of Letters, studying [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. He had applied for the similar faculty at the [[University of Bucharest]] twice, but failed the entry exam.<ref name="gyuartist"/> Soon after admission, he joined the university's theatrical company ''Ars Amatoria <U+015F>i Fiii'', mentored by literary critic [[Ion Vartic]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="pmdiver"/><ref name="igpmori"/> He performed [[radio comedy]] and [[parody]] theater during this time,<ref name="igpmori"/> and was involved in Vartic's ''Echinox'' literary club.<ref>{{ro icon}} Irina Petra<U+015F>, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/4cb2c5db66c8a192_192.pdf "Ioan Gro<U+015F>an sau Nordicul om din Est r<U+0103>t<U+0103>cit <U+00EE>n centrul lumii"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 192, September 2010, p.5</ref> Pascu continued his interest in sports, particularly soccer, and was a noted fan of the college soccer team [[FC Universitatea Cluj]].<ref name="lbnoustation">{{ro icon}} Lauren<U+0163>iu Boariu, [http://www.monitorulcj.ro/sport/7776-un-nou-stadion-trei-generatii "Un nou stadion, trei genera<U+0163>ii"], in ''[[Monitorul de Cluj]]'', October 12, 2011</ref>

In 1986, while ''Ars Amatoria'' was touring [[Bucharest]] with an adaptation of [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]'s plays, Pascu met and befriended members of the comedic ensemble and student group ''[[Divertis]]'',<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="igpmori"/> which performed subtle [[political satire]] against [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]]'s communist rule.<ref name="igpmori"/><ref name="tgfelix">{{ro icon}} [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/divanul-dilemei-vechi/articol/de-la-mariana-cosinzeana-la-felix-iviai-iliescu "De la Mariana Cos<U+00EE>nzeana la Felix, ''via'' Iliescu" (interview with Toni Grecu)], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 136, September 2006</ref><ref>[[Adrian Cioroianu]], ''{{lang|ro|Pe umerii lui Marx.

ISBN 973-669-175-6</ref>  Pascu had been a ''Divertis'' fan since 1982<ref name="igpmori"/> and recalled, "I met with the ''Divertis'' boys after a show. They liked me [and] asked me to join the group".<ref name="gyuartist"/> His first performance with ''Divertis'' took place in 1987, at [[Vo<U+015F>l<U+0103>beni|Izvoru Mure<U+015F>ului]] resort in [[Harghita County]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="igpmori"/> Pascu resumed his musical career, and also in 1987, was invited by Parto<U+015F> to sing at a summer festival in [[Deva, Romania|Deva]].<ref name="pascuofs"/>

In 1988-1989, upon graduation, Pascu taught Romanian language and [[Romanian literature|literature]] at a primary school in [[Ulmu, C<U+0103>l<U+0103>ra<U+015F>i|Ulmu]], [[C<U+0103>l<U+0103>ra<U+015F>i County]], but gave up to pursue his singing career.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> Late in 1989, he was in [[Semenic]], where he met [[Mircea Baniciu]], former member of Romania's leading rock band [[Transsylvania Phoenix]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> He was a guest in Baniciu's home just as the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|anti-communist Revolution]] erupted in [[Timi<U+015F>oara]]. He rejoined ''Divertis'' in [[Ia<U+015F>i]], but their scheduled show there was broken up by the communist authorities.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/>

With the end of communism, Pascu diversified his career as an entertainer. After performing a solo music recital in February 1990, he renewed his contract with ''Divertis'', and toured the country with them.<ref name="pascuofs"/> Later that year, ''Divertis'' performed for the first time in a series of comedy shows airing on [[Romanian Television]] channels.<ref name="pascuofs"/> The group worked with filmmaker and [[Romanian Police|Traffic Police]] officer Virgil Vochin<U+0103>, adding comedy bits to his serialized [[Road traffic safety|road safety campaign]], ''Reflec<U+0163>ii rutiere'' ("Roadside Reflections").<ref>{{ro icon}} Ramona Vintil<U+0103>, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/calendar/astazi-e-ziua-ta-virgil-vochina-515484.htm "Ast<U+0103>zi e ziua ta... Virgil Vochin<U+0103>"], in ''[[Jurnalul Na<U+0163>ional]]'', July 23, 2009</ref> From December 1990 to 1992, Pascu was employed as a program editor by the same station.<ref name="gyuartist"/> 

In 1992, with [[Mircea Rusu]], Pascu released the [[extended play]] recording ''Ar putea fi'' ("It Could Be").<ref name="pascuofs"/> In partnership with his girlfriend Daniela Marin, he founded Tempo Music, which claimed to be Romania's first independent music label.<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/>  Pascu also founded his own band, The Blue Workers.<ref name="pascuofs"/>

===First musical and comedic hits===
Pascu recalled that during the 1990s, Divertis had to perform dozens of consecutive encores while on tour, which interfered with the group's regular ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' viewing parties.<ref name="igpmori"/> According to ''[[Gardianul]]'' newspaper, Pascu's activity with ''Divertis'' turned him into "one of the most popular figures in homegrown comedy".<ref name="pmdiver"/> In his 2006 interview with ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', ''Divertis'' founder [[Toni Grecu]] recalled that Pascu was notable as the only group member not born in the [[Historical regions of Romania|historical region]] of [[Moldavia]].<ref name="tgfelix"/>

In 1993, Pascu experienced his first significant success in music with the album ''Mixed Grill'' and the single "<U+0162>ara arde <U+015F>i babele se piapt<U+0103>n<U+0103>" ("The Country Is Burning and Old Women Are Combing Their Hair", referencing a Romanian proverb).<ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="igpmori"/> A poll conducted by the journal ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'' nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nation-wide station [[Kiss FM (Romania)|Radio Contact]] awarded Pascu its "Composer of the Year" title.<ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="igpmori"/> ''Mixed Grill'' marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae.  Hits such as "Gizzi" and "Mi-am luat colac" ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider him one of the pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like [[El Negro (band)|El Negro]] and [[Pacha Man]].<ref name="vpjamaica"/> The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, and they would not grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits me, that this is how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre."<ref name="igpmori"/> In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the [[harmonica]].<ref name="igpmori"/>

Soon after marrying Daniela Marin in August 1993,<ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="pascuatac">{{ro icon}} Andra Dumitru, [http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/ioan-gyuri-pascu-a-suferit-un-atac-cerebral-209834.html "Ioan Gyuri Pascu a suferit un atac cerebral"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Liber<U+0103>]]'', December 15, 2010</ref> Pascu was invited by director [[Lucian Pintilie]] to star in his film ''[[An Unforgettable Summer]]'', alongside [[Kristin Scott Thomas]], [[Claudiu Bleon<U+0163>]] and [[Marcel Iure<U+015F>]]. Pascu, who referred to filming on location as his mock-[[honeymoon]],<ref name="pascuofs"/> received good reviews for his performance.<ref name="cpbinloc">{{ro icon}} [[Cezar Paul-B<U+0103>descu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/mass-comedia/articol/de-ce-e-inlocuit-divertis-ul "De ce e <U+00EE>nlocuit Divertis-ul"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 244, October 2008</ref>

Over the following years, Pascu and The Blue Workers released two EPs, the [[rhythm and blues]] record ''Ma<U+015F>ina cu jazzolin<U+0103>'' ("The Jazzolin Engine") and ''Caseta pentru minte, inim<U+0103> <U+015F>i gur<U+0103>'' ("The Cassette for the Mind, Heart and Mouth").  Pascu also appeared on a number of comedy recordings released by ''Divertis'',<ref name="pascuofs"/><ref name="igpmori"/> earning Pascu the reputation of a [[protest song]] writer.  He was inspired by [[Politics of Romania|Romanian politics]] and the social debates of the 1990s to write hits like "Morcovul rom<U+00E2>nesc" ("The Romanian Carrot") and "Instalatorul" ("The Plumber").  Pascu acknowledged his political streak, recognized what he considered the necessary link between social phenomena and a songwriter's cultural perspective, and argued that songs should always tell a story.<ref name="mgsbvega">{{ro icon}} Mihai Gavril<U+0103>, S<U+00EE>nziana Boaru, [http://www.adevarul.ro/societate/vedete/Suzanne-Fetita-Gyuri-Ioan-Vega_0_80391983.html "Ioan Gyuri Pascu: 'Feti<U+0163>a mea m-a convins s<U+0103> c<U+00E2>nt la Suzanne Vega' "], in ''[[Adev<U+0103>rul]]'', July 16, 2009</ref> One of the [[Parody music|parody songs]] included on ''Ma<U+015F>ina cu jazzolin<U+0103>'', titled "Africa, Africa", drew special interest in cultural circles with its satirical undertones. The lyrics suggested that modern Romania was no better than the average African nation. According to historian [[Sorin Mitu]], "Africa, Africa" showed "the Romanians' tendency to relate to extra-European realities", a trend he observed during Ceau<U+015F>escu's final decade, and then throughout the early [[History of Romania since 1989|post-revolutionary period]].<ref>[[Sorin Mitu]], ''National Identity of Romanians in Transylvania'', [[Central European University Press]], Budapest, 2001, p.121-122. ISBN 963-9116-95-5</ref>

In 1995, after a series of festivals where he sang together with The Blue Workers, Pascu had a solo recital at [[Bra<U+015F>ov]]'s [[Golden Stag Festival]],<ref name="pascuofs"/> and was awarded the Best Album trophy by the music magazine ''Actualitatea Muzical<U+0103>'', for ''Ma<U+015F>ina cu jazzolin<U+0103>''.<ref>[[Octavian Ursulescu]], "Global Music Pulse.

He is chiefly remembered in [[pop culture]] as the spokesman for [[Vodafone Romania|Connex]], one of the first mobile phone operators in Romania, with the catchphrase ''Alo, Maria?'' ("Hello, Maria?").<ref>{{ro icon}} Anca Arsene-B<U+0103>rbulescu, [http://www.businessmagazin.ro/special/istoria-telefoniei-mobile-din-romania-7800961/?p=2 "Istoria telefoniei mobile din Rom<U+00E2>nia"], in ''[[Business Magazin]]'', December 16, 2010; Maria Bercea, [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/tema-saptaminii/articol/bercea-mondiala "Bercea Mondiala"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 375, April 2011; Florin Dumitrescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/PUBLICITATE.-Conu-Chirita-in-balon-%28I%29*articleID_6212-articles_details.html "Publicitate.

In February 1997, Pascu released the album ''G<U+00E2>nduri nevinovate'' ("Innocent Thoughts"). According to his website, it can be considered as Pascu's "first less commercial record."<ref name="pascuofs"/> Pascu's daughter, Ana Iarina, was born later in the same month.<ref name="pascuofs"/> 

After 1997, Pascu prioritized his activity as a music promoter and producer. Between 1998 and 2000, he and his wife helped launch successful pop and [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Vama Veche (band)|Vama Veche]], [[Domni<U+015F>oara Pogany]] and [[Dinu Ol<U+0103>ra<U+015F>u]].<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/>  After releasing the song collection ''Pove<U+015F>tile lui Gyuri'' ("Gyuri's Stories") in 1999,<ref name="igpmori"/> he gave up music, stating that he had become disenchanted with newer pop trends,<ref name="gyuartist"/><ref name="pascuofs"/> but returned in 2000 with a limited-release record titled ''Las<U+0103> (muzic<U+0103> de cas<U+0103>)'', "Leave It (Home Music)". As stated on his website, the record registered success with "his closest fans" and with members of the [[Romanian-American]] community.<ref name="pascuofs"/>

===From ''Occident'' to ''Felix <U+015F>i Otilea''<!-- sic -->===
Also in 2000, Pascu began working with filmmaker [[Cristian Mungiu]]. He wrote the soundtrack to Mungiu's short film ''Zapping'' and appeared with [[Mircea Diaconu]] in Mungiu's medium-length film ''[[Corul pompierilor]]''.<ref name="pascuofs"/> They collaborated in ''[[Occident (film)|Occident]]'', which featured music composed by Pascu and his supporting role as "Gic<U+0103>", opposite [[Alexandru Papadopol]] ("Luci"). This contribution earned Pascu critical accolades.  Film critic [[Alex.

Two years after ''Occident''{{'}}s premiere, Pascu released the album ''St<U+00E2>ngul de a visa'' ("The Left to Dream"), which was less of a commercial success and as Pascu noted, was inconsistent with the editorial policies of commercial radio.
