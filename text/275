'''Peter Jason Matthew Helliar''' (born in -Italy [[June 16]], [[1975]]) is an [[Australia]]n [[comedian]] and [[television]] personality.

==Early career==
Helliar initially worked the [[Melbourne]] [[Stand-up comedy]] circuit in the mid nineties, performing in various venues and the annual [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]]. 

In 1998 he became a regular on [[Melbourne]] [[community television]] [[Channel 31]]'s weekly variety show ''[[The Loft Live]]'', hosted by [[Rove McManus]] and including other well known Melbourne comedians such as [[Dave Hughes]], [[Kim Hope]], and [[Dave Callan]]. He appeared as a live on-screen guest as well as scripting and recording skits for live playback.

==Commercial Television==

In [[1999]], [[television station]] [[GTV9]] signed [[Rove McManus]] to host a weekly live program called ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'', based largely on the comedy / talk show model developed on ''[[The Loft Live]]''. Comedians [[Corinne Grant]] and [[Dave Callan]] along with Peter Helliar were used as "sidekicks". The show received lukewarm reviews, and was discontinued after one season.

[[Network Ten]] picked up the show in [[2000]], now called ''[[Rove Live]]''. His role includes appearing in segments such as ''My Charader'', and other live and pre-recorded "bits". However, the show was revamped for [[2007]], with Pete now acting as Rove's main sidekick alongside, [[Dave Hughes]] and [[Carrie Bickmore]]. He also presents his very own segment "PeteSpace", an obvious parody of [[MySpace]].

Peter Helliar also appears in two other programs created by [[Roving Enterprises]]:
*[[Skithouse|SkitHOUSE]]; a half hour weekly [[sketch comedy]] show,
*''[[Before the Game|After The Game (2004)]]'' with Peter Helliar as host, screening after the [[AFL Football]] match on Saturday nights. An earlier timeslot was used from [[2005]], and consequently the program adopted the new name ''[[Before the Game]]''. The program also has regular panel members: comedians [[Dave Hughes]] and [[Lehmo]], and sports personalities [[Andy Maher]] and [[Samantha Lane]]. 

In 2006 Helliar was crowned "Australia's Brainiest Comedian" after defeating other notable comedians such as [[Frank Woodley]] and [[Dave Hughes]]. Helliar said after winning "I think that if I can win this then comedians definitely need to get smarter".
He also has appeared on numerous Fernwood (Australian women's only fitness centre) commercials, where he is featured trying to sneak into the centre by appearing in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]].

=="Strauchanie"==

From the 2005 AFL season, Peter created an [[alter ego]] called [[Bryan Strauchan]] which initially debuted on ''Before the Game''.  Bryan Strauchan is supposedly the last pick in the 2004 AFL National Draft, yet to get a game for his new club [[Collingwood Football Club]] (Peter is a big Collingwood supporter).   For the role, Helliar dons a blonde [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] wig as a stereotypical Australian [[bogan]] footy player "wannabee".  The comedy is achieved by self effacing humour, puting Bryan in situations that highlight his weight, lack of fitness and general inability whilst his egotistical personality and allusions of grandeur means he is completely unaware of these things.  Since the character has experienced raised popularity and profile, and is arguably become bigger celebrity than Peter Helliar, ''Strauchnie'' has made several subsequent appearances across different media.  Helliar is currently considering releasing a new movie based on the character planned for release in 2010.{{Fact|date=June 2007}}

==Radio==
Between [[1998]] and [[2000]] he was a regular guest on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC's]] national youth network [[Triple J]].

In [[2002]], the [[Austereo]] radio network signed Peter Helliar to appear alongside TV colleagues [[Rove McManus]] and [[Corinne Grant]] on the weekly program ''[[Rove Live Radio|Saturday Morning Rove]]'', broadcasting from [[3FOX|Fox FM]] every Saturday from 10AM to Midday having been pre-recorded the day before. In [[2004]] the program moved to Friday mornings allowing live phone callers, and was re-titled ''[[Rove Live Radio]]''. It was discontinued at the end of [[2004]].

In [[2004]], Peter Helliar was signed to do the breakfast shift on [[Austereo|Austereo's]] [[Sydney]] station [[2Day FM]] with [[Judith Lucy]] and [[Kaz Cooke]]. The program was discontinued after its first year.

Still signed to [[Austereo]], Peter also appeared on the [[Melbourne]] based ''[[The Arvo]]'', a daily program broadcast out of [[3FOX|Fox FM]] between 4PM and 6PM and networked to other capital cities. It was discontinued in June 2005.

As of July 2005, Peter Helliar was still currently contracted to [[Austereo]]. Pete now does his own show called ''Pete's Show'' which is on 10am - 12pm on Fridays.
