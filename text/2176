This game was Nebraska's first conference game as they played in the Western Inter-State University Football Association with Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa.  Missouri had a strict policy that didn not allow for any athletic contest against teams that had black players.  Nebraska had George Flippin so Missouri forfeited the game which was recorded as a 1-0 conference victory.
