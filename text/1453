[[Image:Faroe stamp 428 The Prophet.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A depiction of a V<U+00F6>lva on a [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] stamp by [[Anker Eli Petersen]] (2003).]]
A '''V<U+00F6>lva''', ''Vala'', ''Sei<U+00F0>kona'', ''Sp<U+00E1>kona'', ''Spaewife'' or ''Wicce'' ([[Old English]]) was a wise woman, [[shaman]], or priestess in [[Germanic paganism]], in later [[Norse paganism]], and are a recurring motif in [[Norse mythology]].

They were highly respected members of society who took care of people's ailments, both physical and spiritual with their herbalism and prophecies. With the introduction of Christianity, they would become marginalized and even persecuted, but they would live on in the [[Northern Europe]]an concept of the [[Witchcraft|witch]].

==Names and etymology==
The V<U+00F6>lvas and their male counterparts were referred to by many names. The Old Norse word ''V<U+00F6>lva'' means "wand carrier" and it continues [[Proto-Germanic]] *''walw<U+014D>n'', which is derived from a word for "wand" (ON ''v<U+00F6>lr'').<ref name="hell">[http://runeberg.org/svetym/1169.html Hellquist 1922:1081]</ref> ''Vala'', on the other hand, is a literary form based on ''V<U+00F6>lva''.<ref name="hell"/> Other names were ''sei<U+00F0>kona'' for women and ''sei<U+00F0>ma<U+00F0>r'' for men, where ''[[sei<U+00F0>r]]'' refers to magic practices and is related to the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] words ''saitas'' ("magic"), ''saitu'' and ''saisti'' ("interpret signs"), and also to [[Greek language|Greek]] ''(h)oim<U+1E17>'' ("song", etc.).<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0790.html Hellquist 1922:702]</ref> As for ''sp<U+00E1>kona'', and its English form ''spaewife'', the ON word ''sp<U+00E1>'' refers to [[prophecy|prophesying]] and it continues Proto-Germanic ''*spah-'' and the [[Proto-Indo-European root|PIE root]] ''{{Unicode|*(s)pe<U+1E31>}}'', and it is consequently related to Latin ''speccio'' ("sees") and [[Sanskrit]] ''sp<U+00E1><U+00E7>ati'' and ''p<U+00E1><U+00E7>yati'' ("sees", etc.).<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0939.html Hellquist 1922:851]</ref> The etymology of the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''wicce'', which resulted in the modern word [[witch]], is more contested, see [[Witch (etymology)]]. The Anglo-Saxon name for male practitioners of magic, ''wicca'', is continued in the Neopagan movement [[Wicca]].

==Overview==
V<U+00F6>lvas practiced [[seid|sei<U+00F0>r]], ''sp<U+00E1>'' and [[galdr]], practices which encompassed [[shamanism]], [[sorcery]], [[prophet|prophecy]] and other forms of indigenous magic. Sei<U+00F0>r in particular had connotations of ''[[ergi]]'' (unmanliness), although there were male practitioners. Historical and mythological depictions of V<U+00F6>lvas show that they were held in high esteem and they were held to possess such powers that even the father of the gods, [[Odin]] himself, consulted a V<U+00F6>lva for what the future had in store for the gods. This account is preserved in the ''[[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]]'' which roughly translates to "prophecy of the V<U+00F6>lva". Examples of V<U+00F6>lvas in Norse literature include the seeress Heidi (alt. Heith) in ''[[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]]'', [[Gr<U+00F3>a]] in ''[[Svipdagsm<U+00E1>l]]'', Thorbj<U+00F6>rg in the ''[[Saga of Eric the Red]]'' and [[Huld]] in for instance ''[[Ynglinga saga]]''.

The V<U+00F6>lvas were not considered to be harmless.<ref name="Harrison55"/> The goddess who was most skilled in magic was [[Freyja]], and she was not only a goddess of love, but also warlike divinity who caused screams of anguish, blood and death, and what Freyja performed in [[Asgard]], the world of the gods, the V<U+00F6>lvas tried to perform in [[Midgard]], the world of men.<ref name="Harrison55">Harrison & Svensson 2007:55</ref> The weapon of the V<U+00F6>lva was not the spear, the axe or the sword but instead they were held to influence battles with different means, and one of them was the [[wand]],<ref name="Harrison55"/> (see the section [[#Wands and weaving|wands and weaving, below]]).

==Early accounts==
[[Image:Cimbrians and Teutons.png|thumb|200px|The migrations of the Teutons and the Cimbri]]
The earliest descriptions of such women appear in Roman accounts about the Germanic [[Cimbri]] whose priestesses were aged women dressed in white. They sacrificed the prisoners of war and sprinkled their blood (see [[Bl<U+00F3>t]]), in order to prophesy coming events.<ref>[[Strabo]] in [[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]] 7.2.3</ref>

In his [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]] (1, 50) [[Julius Caesar]] writes in the course of clashes with Germanic tribesmen under [[Ariovistus]] (58 BCE):
<blockquote>When Caesar inquired of his prisoners, wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, he discovered this to be the reason -- that among the Germans it was the custom for their ''matrons'' to pronounce from lots and divination whether it were expedient that the battle should be engaged in or not; that they had said, "that it was not the will of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in battle before the new moon."</blockquote>

[[Tacitus]] also writes about female prophets among the [[Germanic peoples]] in his book ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]]'' 4, 61 - notably a certain [[Veleda]]:
<blockquote>[...] by ancient usage the Germans attributed to many of their women prophetic powers and, as the superstition grew in strength, even actual divinity.</blockquote>

[[Jordanes]] relates in his ''[[Getica]]'' (XXIV:121) of [[Goths|Gothic]] V<U+00F6>lvas called ''[[Aliorumnas]]''. They were driven into exile by King [[Filimer]], when the [[Goths]] had settled in [[Oium]] ([[Ukraine]]). The name is probably a corruption of a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Halju-runnos''[http://www.harbornet.com/folks/theedrich/Goths/Goths1.htm], meaning "hell-runners" or "runners to the realm of the dead" (which refers to their shamanistic experiences during trance). These V<U+00F6>lvas were condemned to seek refuge far away and, according to this account, engendered the [[Huns]].

The [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Paulus Diaconus]], who died in Southern Italy in the 790s, was proud of his origins and wrote on how his people once had departed from southern [[Scandinavia]].<ref name="Harrison74"/> He tells of a conflict between the early Lombards and the Vandals. The latter turned to Odin (''Godan''), while Gambara, the mother of the two Lombard chieftains Ibor and Aio, turned to Odin's spouse Frea (Freyja/Frigg). Frea helped Gambara play a trick on Odin and thanks to the V<U+00F6>lva Gambara's good relations with the goddess, her people won the battle.<ref name="Harrison74">Harrison & Svensson 2007:74</ref>

A detailed [[witness|eyewitness]] account of a [[human sacrifice]] by what may have been a V<U+00F6>lva was given by [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] as part of his account of an [[embassy]] to the [[Volga Bulgars]] in 921. In [[Viking funeral#Ibn Fadlan's account|his description of the funeral]] of a [[Scandinavia]]n [[Germanic chieftain|chieftain]], a slave girl [[volunteer]]s to die with her [[slavemaster|master]]. After ten [[day]]s of [[festival|festivities]], she is stabbed to death by an old woman (a sort of priestess who is referred to as 'Angel of Death') and burnt together with the deceased in his [[boat]] (see [[ship burial]], [[Oseberg]]).

==Viking society==
In Viking society, a V<U+00F6>lva was an elderly woman who had released herself from the strong family bonds that normally surrounded women in the [[Norse clans|Old Norse clan society]]. She travelled the land, usually followed by a retinue of young people, and she was summoned in times of crisis. She had immense authority and she charged well for her services.<ref name="meulen81">Steinsland, G. & Meulengracht S<U+00F8>rensen, P. 1998:81</ref>

In addition, many aristocratic Viking women wanted to serve Freyja and represent her in [[Midgard]].<ref name="Harrison69">Harrison & Svensson 2007:69</ref> They married Viking warlords who had [[Odin]] as a role model, and they settled in great halls that were earthly representations of [[Valhalla]].<ref name="Harrison69"/> In these halls there were magnificent feasts with ritualized meals, and the visiting chieftains can be likened with the [[einherjar]], the fallen warriors who fought bravely and were served drinks by [[Valkyrie]]s.<ref name="Harrison69"/> However, the duties of the mistresses were not limited to serving mead to visiting guests, but they were also expected to take part in warfare by manipulating weaving tools magically when their spouses were out in battle.<ref name="Harrison69"/> Scholars no longer believe that these women waited passively at home, and there is evidence for their magic activities both in archaeological finds and in Old Norse sources, such as the ''[[Darra<U+00F0>arlj<U+00F3><U+00F0>]]''.<ref name="Harrison69"/> 

It is difficult to draw a line between the aristocratic lady and the wandering V<U+00F6>lva, but Old Norse sources present the V<U+00F6>lva as more professional and she went from estate to estate selling her spiritual services.<ref name="Harrison69">Harrison & Svensson 2007:74</ref> The V<U+00F6>lva had greater authority than the aristocratic lady, but both were ultimately dependent on the benevolence of the warlord that they served.<ref name="Harrison69"/> When they had been attached to a warlord, their authority depended on their personal competence and credibility.<ref name="Harrison69"/>

===Saga sources===
[[Image:Ed0048.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The seeress speaks her prophecy in this illustration to a 19th century Swedish translation of the [[Poetic Edda]].]]
In ''[[Flateyjarb<U+00F3>k]]'', toward the end of ''[[Norna-Gests <U+00FE><U+00E1>ttr]]'', Norna-Gest details that "sp<U+00E1>konur traveled around the country-side and fore-told the fates of men."<ref>[http://www.snerpa.is/net/forn/nornages.htm The Tale of Norna-Gest]</ref>

''[[The Saga of Eric the Red]]'' relates that the settlers in [[Greenland]] c. 1000 were suffering a time of starvation. In order to prepare for the future, the V<U+00F6>lva <U+00DE><U+00F3>rbj<U+00F6>rgr was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was thoroughly cleaned and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.

The V<U+00F6>lva appeared in the evening and she was dressed in a blue or black [[cloak]], which was decked with gems to the hem, and it reached down to her feet. In her hand, she wielded a wand, the symbolic [[distaff]] (''sei<U+00F0>stafr''), which was adorned with brass and decked with gems on the knob. In ''[[Orvar-Odd's Saga|<U+00D6>rvar-Odd's Saga]]'', the sei<U+00F0>kona also wears a blue or black cloak and carries a distaff (a wand which allegedly has the power of causing forgetfulness in one who is tapped three times on the cheek by it). The colour of the cloak may be less significant than the fact that it was intended to signify the otherness of the sei<U+00F0>kona.

The ''Saga of Eric the Red'' further relates that around her neck she wore a necklace of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of [[amadou]] from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the sei<U+00F0>r. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.

As the V<U+00F6>lva entered the room, she was hailed with reverence by the household, and then she was led to the high seat, where she was provided with dishes prepared only for her. She had a [[porridge]] made of goat milk and a dish made of hearts from all the kinds of animals at the homestead. She ate the dishes with a brass spoon and a knife whose point was broken off.

The V<U+00F6>lva was to sleep at the farm during the night and the next day was reserved for her dance. In order to dance the sei<U+00F0>r, she needed special tools. First, she positioned herself on a special elevated platform and a group of young women sat down around her. The girls sang special songs intended to summon the powers that the V<U+00F6>lva wished to communicate with. The session was a success, because the V<U+00F6>lva was permitted to see far into the future, and the famine was averted.

In the prologue of the [[Prose Edda]], the origin of [[Thor|Thor's]] wife [[Sif]] is detailed, where she is said to be a ''sp<U+00E1>kona''. Snorri contextually correlates Sif with the oracular seeress [[Sibyl]] on this basis.<ref>[http://www.heimskringla.no/original/snorre/prologus.php The prologue of Heimskringla]</ref><ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18947/18947-h/18947-h.htm#foreword The prologue of Heimskringla in translation]</ref>
===Archaeological record===
[[Image:Finds from a priestess' grave.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Finds from a V<U+00F6>lva's grave in [[K<U+00F6>pingsvik]], [[<U+00D6>land]]. There is an 82 cm long [[wand]] of iron with bronze details and a unique model of a house on the top. There is also a pitcher from Persia or Central Asia, and a West European bronze bowl. Dressed in a bear pelt, she had received a [[ship burial]] with both human and animal sacrifice. The finds are on display in the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
Scandinavian archaeologists have discovered wands in about 40 female graves, and they have usually been discovered in rich graves with valuable [[Viking funeral#Grave goods|grave offerings]] which shows that the V<U+00F6>lvas belonged to the highest level of society.<ref name="Harrison56">Harrison & Svensson 2007:56</ref> 

One example is a grave in [[Fyrkat]], [[Denmark]] which turned out to be the richest grave in the area.<ref name="Harrison56"/> She had been [[Chariot burial|buried in a wagon]] from which the wheels had been removed.<ref name="Harrison56"/> She had been plainly clad in what was probably only a long dress.<ref name="Harrison56"/>  Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed.<ref name="Harrison56"/> At her head, she had a [[Gotland]]ic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from [[Finland]] and [[Russia]].<ref name="Harrison56"/> At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools and they comprised a [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellet]] from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of [[henbane]].<ref name="Harrison57">Harrison & Svensson 2007:57</ref> If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying.<ref name="Harrison57"/> In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump.<ref name="Harrison57"/> When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the V<U+00F6>lva performed her rituals and [[Hlidskjalf]] from which [[Odin]] watched across the world.<ref name="Harrison57"/>
[[Image:Freyja in silver.jpg|thumb|left|120px|The pendant, in the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].]]
Another notable grave was the [[Oseberg ship]] burial in Norway that revealed two women who had received a sumptuous burial.<ref name="Harrison57"/> One of the women was most likely a high-ranking lady who knew how to practice the [[seid]], as she had been accompanied with a wand of wood.<ref name="Harrison57"/> In the grave, there were also four seeds from the [[cannabis]] plant which probably had been in the pillows that supported the corpses.<ref name="Harrison57"/> Moreover, additional cannabis seeds were discovered in a small leather pouch.<ref name="Harrison57"/> Since the pouch contained too few seeds to have anything to do with the cultivation of cannabis, they were probably used for something else.<ref name="Harrison57"/> If the queen who had been buried in Oseberg had smoked these seeds, she would not only have sensed a feeling of weightlessness and happiness, but she would also have had a distorted experience of time and space.<ref name="Harrison57"/>

Around 1000 BCE, a V<U+00F6>lva was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyh<U+00F6>ga in [[<U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland]], Sweden.<ref name="Harrison58">Harrison & Svensson 2007:58</ref> In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher.<ref name="Harrison58"/> There was also a silver pendant which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck.<ref name="Harrison58"/> This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as [[Freyja]]'s favourite necklace, the [[Br<U+00ED>singamen]]. The pendant may represent Freyja herself, the most prominent V<U+00F6>lva of them all.<ref name="Harrison58"/>

In [[Birka]], a V<U+00F6>lva and a warrior were once buried together. Above them, a spear was positioned in order to dedicate the dead couple to [[Odin]].<ref name="Harrison62">Harrison & Svensson 2007:62</ref> They had probably served Freyja and Odin, two gods of war, and he had done so with his spear and she with her wand.<ref name="Harrison62"/>

===Wands and weaving===
:{{main|Wand|Weaving (mythology)}}
In theory, invisible fetters and bonds could be controlled from a loom, and if a lady loosened a knot in the woof, she could liberate the leg of her hero.<ref name="Harrison72">Harrison & Svensson 2007:72</ref> But if she tied a knot, she could stop the enemy from moving.<ref name="Harrison72"/> The men may have fought on the battle field in sweat and blood, but in a spiritual way, their women took part.<ref name="Harrison72"/> It is not by coincidence that archaeologists find weaving tools and weapons side by side.<ref name="Harrison72"/>

A distaff possessed magical powers, and in the world of the gods, the [[Norn]]s twinned the threads of fate.<ref name="Harrison72"/> In ''[[Helgakvi<U+00F0>a Hundingsbana I]]'', Norns arrive at the birth of [[Helgi Hundingsbane]] and twinned his fate as a hero, and it is possible that these Norns were not divine beings but V<U+00F6>lvas.<ref name="Harrison73">Harrison & Svensson 2007:73</ref> Many of the wands that have been excavated have a basket-like shape in the top, and they are very similar to distaffs used for spinning linnen.<ref name="Harrison73"/> One theory for the origin of the word ''sei<U+00F0>r'' is "thread spun with a distaff", and according to this theory, practicing magic was to send out spiritual threads.<ref name="Harrison72"/> Since the Norsemen believed that the Norns controlled people's fate by spinning, it is very likely that they considered individual fates to be controllable with the same method.<ref name="Harrison73"/>

It is not a coincidence, that women are called "peace-weavers" in ''[[Beowulf]]'', and since [[Freyja]] had started the first war, it was on the part of the V<U+00F6>lva to decide when to start wars by practicing magic.<ref name="Harrison74">Harrison & Svensson 2007:74</ref> This is probably why [[Harald I of Denmark|Harald Bluetooth]], who was at war with the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman emperor]] apparently kept a V<U+00F6>lva at Fyrkat.<ref name="Harrison74"/>

===Sexual rites and drugs===
Nowadays, it is generally accepted among scholars that fertility was essential in Viking society, and the most famous find that testify to such rites is a small statuette that was found in R<U+00E4>llinge in Sweden in the early 20th century.<ref name="Harrison75">Harrison & Svensson 2007:75</ref> The aspect of this statuette indicates that it was related to fertility rites and it is usually interpreted as Freyja's brother [[Freyr]].<ref name="Harrison75"/> Moreover, [[Adam of Bremen]] tells of the phallic statue of Freyr in the [[Temple at Uppsala]] and of the racy songs that were song during the rituals.<ref name="Harrison75"/> In ''[[V<U+00F6>lsa <U+00FE><U+00E1>ttr]]'', there is an account on how a horse's penis was worshipped by a pagan family, an account that has connections with an old Indo-Aryan sacrificial rite.<ref name="Harrison75-78">Harrison & Svensson 2007:75-78</ref> In [[Ibn Fadlan]]'s description of the burial of a Scandinavian chieftain on the Volga, a slave girl who was to be sacrificed had to undergo several sexual rites.<ref name="Harrison79">Harrison & Svensson 2007:79</ref>  First, she had sex with some of the men in the chieftain's retinue, then when the chieftain had been put in the ship, she went from tent to tent where she visited warriors and traders.<ref name="Harrison79"/> Every man told her that they did what they did for their love to the dead chieftain.<ref name="Harrison79"/> Lastly, she entered a tent that had been raised on the ship, and in it six men had intercourse with her before she was strangled and stabbed.<ref name="Harrison79"/> The sexual rites with the slave girl show that she was considered to be a vessel for the transmission of life force to the deceased chieftain.<ref>Steinsland, G. & Meulengracht S<U+00F8>rensen, P. 1998:89</ref>

All wands that have been excavated can not be associated with distaffs, but instead they appear to represent a phallos, and moreover the use of magic had close associations with sexuality in Old Norse society.<ref name="Harrison75"/> In the eddic poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', due to his interest in seid, [[Odin]] is depicted as being [[ergi]], which suggests that he was perceived as unmanly, cowardly and accepting the female role in sexual intercourse.<ref name="Harrison75"/> As early as 1902, an anonymous German scholar (he did not dare publishing in his own name) wrote on how seid was connected with sex.<ref name="Harrison75"/> He argued that the wand was an obvious phallic symbol and why should magic otherwise be considered taboo for men.<ref name="Harrison75"/> It was possible that the magic practices included sexual rites.<ref name="Harrison75"/> As early as 1920, it was noted that the name of the male magic practitioner Ragnvald Rettilbein referred to such practices, as ''rettilbein'' means "straight member".<ref name="Harrison75"/>

The V<U+00F6>lvas were known for their art of seduction, which was one of the reasons why they were considered dangerous.<ref name="Harrison79">Harrison & Svensson 2007:79</ref> One of the stanzas in ''[[H<U+00E1>vam<U+00E1>l]]'' warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill.<ref name="Harrison79"/> Freyja, who is the master of seid, has a free sexual life that gives her a bad reputation in certain myths.<ref name="Harrison79"/>

One of the methods for seducing men may have been the use of drugs.<ref name="Harrison79"/> In [[Fyrkat]], the grave of a V<U+00F6>lva revealed the use of [[henbane]], a drug which does not only give hallucinations, as it can also be a powerful [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name="Harrison79"/> If Freyja was the goddess of love in [[Asgard]], the V<U+00F6>lva was her counterpart in [[Midgard]].<ref name="Harrison79"/>

===Other practices===
The V<U+00F6>lvas could also employ drums during their sessions, like the [[Sami shamanism|Sami shamans]].<ref name="meulen82">Steinsland, G. & Meulengracht S<U+00F8>rensen, P. 1998:82</ref> All V<U+00F6>lvas were not surrounded by the same retinue and preparations as <U+00DE><U+00F3>rbj<U+00F6>rgr, but she could also perform the sei<U+00F0>r alone, which was called ''<U+00FA>tiseta'' (literally, "sitting out").<ref>Blain 2001:61ff</ref><ref>Keyser 1854:275</ref> This practice appears to have involved [[meditation]] or [[introspection]], possibly for the purpose of [[divination]]. Blain (2001) sees it as an aspect of [[seidhr]] reminiscent of [[Shamanism]]. The term is derived from a 13th century [[Icelandic law]] which outlawed ''<U+00FA>tiseta at vekja tr<U+00F6>ll upp ok fremja hei<U+00F0>ni'' "sitting out to wake up [[troll]]s and practicing heathenry". Although the theoretical punishment for this offense foreseen by the law was death, nobody was convicted under it until a minor [[witch craze]] reached Iceland in the 17th century.<ref>Blain 2001:62</ref> Keyser (1854) describes it as "a peculiar kind of sorcery [...] in which the magician sat out at night under the open sky [...] especially to inquire into the future".

===Male practitioners===
[[Image:Sejdmen.jpg|right|250px|thumb|During the Christianization of Norway, King [[Olaf Trygvasson]] had seidmen tied up and thrown on a [[skerry]] at ebb.]]
Men who practiced sorcery or magic were not received with the same respect, because they were dealing with a practice that was held to be in the domain of women.<ref name="meulen81"/><ref name="Harrison65"/> The ''[[Saga of Eric the Red]]'' relates that Ragnvaldr Rettilbein, one of [[Harald Fairhair]]'s sons by the [[Sami people|Sami]] woman Sn<U+00F6>frid, was a sei<U+00F0>ma<U+00F0>r.<ref name="meulen81"/><ref name="Harrison65">Harrison & Svensson 2007:65</ref> The king had him burnt to death inside a house with a large group of fellow male practitioners.<ref name="meulen81"/>

In ''[[Lokasenna]]'', [[Loki]] taunts [[Odin]] for having practiced magic on [[Sams<U+00F8>]], something which was considered sexually perverse, [[ergi]].<ref name="Harrison65"/>

==Disappearance==
Their disappearance was due to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Church of England]], the [[Lutheran]] and [[Reformed Church]]es which along with civil governments had laws enacted against them, as in this [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]:

<blockquote>"If any ''wicca'' (witch), ''wiglaer'' ([[Magician (paranormal)|wizard]]), [[false swearer]], ''[[morthwyrtha]]'' (worshipper of the dead) or any foul contaminated, manifest ''[[horcwenan]]'' ([[whore]]), be anywhere in the land, man shall drive them out."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We teach that every priest shall extinguish [[heathendom]] and forbid [[wilweorthunga]] ([[fountain worship]]), ''[[licwiglunga]]'' (incantations of the dead), ''[[hwata]]'' ([[omen]]s), ''[[galdra]]'' ([[magic and religion|magic]]), [[man worship]] and the abominations that men exercise in various sorts of [[witchcraft]], and in ''[[frithspottum]]'' ([[peace-enclosures]]) with elms and other trees, and with stones, and with many phantoms." (source: 16th [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] enacted under [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] in the 10th century.)</blockquote>

They were persecuted and killed in the course of [[Christianization]], which also led to an extreme polarization of the role of females in Germanic society.

==In fiction==
The term Spaewife was used as the title for several fictional works: [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s poem "The Spaewife"; [[John Galt (novelist)|John Galt]]'s historical romance ''The Spaewife: A Tale of the Scottish Chronicles''; and [[John Boyce]]'s ''The Spaewife, or, The Queen's Secret'' (under the pen-name Paul Peppergrass).

===Melville===
Francis Melville describes a spae-wife as a type of [[elf]] in ''The Book of Faeries''.
<blockquote>"No taller than a human finger, fairy spae wives are usually dressed in the clothes of a peasant. However, when properly summoned, the attire changes from common to magnificent: blue cloak with a gem-lined collar and black lambskin hood lined with catskin, calfskin boots, and catskin gloves. Like human spae wives, they can also predict the future, through [[runes]], tea leaves and signs generated by natural phenomena, and are good healers. They are said to be descended from the erectors of the [[standing stones]]."</blockquote>
