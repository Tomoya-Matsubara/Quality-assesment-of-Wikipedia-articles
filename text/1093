It has been serving [[birdwatcher]]s and ornithologists in the four [[England|English]] counties of [[Staffordshire]], [[Warwickshire]], [[Worcestershire]] and (since its separation from the aforesaid counties in 1974) the Metropolitan [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], with lectures, field trips, research, a bulletin and an annual report, since 1929. It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] in England and Wales, number 213311.<ref name="CC">{{EW charity|213311}}</ref>

== History ==

The Club was founded as the '''Birmingham Bird Club''', by W. E. Groves and friends on 1 November 1929.<ref name="chrono">{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/chrono|title=Chronology|publisher=West Midland Bird Club|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref> The name changed to '''Birmingham and District Bird Club''' in 1945, to ''' The Birmingham and West Midland Bird Club''' in 1947, and the current name was adopted in 1959.<ref name="chrono" />
