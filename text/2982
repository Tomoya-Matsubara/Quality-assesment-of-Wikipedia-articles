The '''Coand<U+0103>-1910''', designed by [[Romania]]n inventor [[Henri Coand<U+0103>]], was an early [[sesquiplane]] aircraft which featured an experimental [[aircraft engine]] that was later argued as being the first [[motorjet|motorjet engine]]. Coand<U+0103> used the term "turbo-propulseur" to describe this propulsion design, a complex heat-augmented centrifugal compressor propulsion system with a multi-bladed rotary fan situated in a duct and driven by a conventional [[piston engine]]. The unconventional aircraft attracted attention at the [[Paris Air Show|Second International Aeronautical Exhibition]] in Paris in October 1910, being the only exhibit without a [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]. Coand<U+0103> used a similar mechanism to drive a snow [[sled]], but did not develop it further for aircraft.

Decades later, after the practical demonstration of [[motorjet]]s and [[turbojet]]s, Coand<U+0103> claimed that his turbo-propulseur was the first motorjet engine complete with fuel combustion in the air stream. He also said that he had made a single brief flight in December 1910, crashing just after take-off, the aircraft destroyed by fire. Two aviation historians countered Coand<U+0103>'s version of events, saying there was no proof that the engine had combustion in the air stream, and no proof that the aircraft ever flew.<ref name="Gibbs-Smith correspondence">{{cite journal |last=Gibbs-Smith |first=Charles Harvard |authorlink=Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%202323.html?search=coanda%201910&tracked=1 |title=Correspondence: 'Coanda's 1910 Jet Experiments' |journal=[[Flight (magazine)|Flight]] |date=14 October 1960

In 2010, based on Coand<U+0103>'s 1910 jet experiments, the centennial of the jet aircraft was celebrated especially in Romania. A special coin and stamp were issued, and a working replica of the aircraft is under construction. At the [[European Parliament]], an exhibition commemorated the building and testing of the Coand<U+0103>-1910.

==Early developments==
Coand<U+0103> was interested in achieving reactive propelled flight as early as 1905, conducting tests in [[Bucharest]] of rockets from the [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian Army]] arsenal attached to model aircraft.<ref name="Cer Senin, Romanian Air Force magazine, 2010">{{cite journal |year=2010 |format=PDF |first=George-Paul |last=Sandachi |title=1910 <U+2013> centenarul geniului aeronautic romanesc <U+2013> 2010 |journal=Cer Senin, Editie Speciala |volume=3 |page=15 |url=http://www.roaf.ro/ro/cer_senin/arhiva/2010/cer_senin_3_2010.pdf |language=Romanian}}</ref> In secret, at [[Spandau]] in Germany, Coand<U+0103> successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single [[Tractor configuration|tractor propeller]], and two [[counter-rotating propellers]] providing lift, powered by a 50-[[horsepower]] (37&nbsp;[[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]]) [[Antoinette (manufacturer)|Antoinette]] engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]] to the vertical.<ref name="L'A<U+00E9>rophileMarch1908">{{cite journal |date=1 March 1908 |title=Machine volante Coanda|journal=L'A<U+00E9>rophile |volume=16 |page=93 |language=French |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/larophile16besa#page/n157/mode/2up}}</ref> According to later claims, Coand<U+0103> tested the aircraft at [[Kassel|Cassel]], witnessed by the [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of the German Empire (1871<U+2013>1918)|Chancellor]] of the German Empire [[Bernhard von B<U+00FC>low]]. It was around this time that Coand<U+0103>'s interest in jet propulsion began, and according to him the aircraft and a jet-propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the ''Sporthalle'' (indoor sports arena) in Berlin.<ref name="Rises and Falls"/>
Coand<U+0103> continued his studies at [[Liege, Belgium]], where together with his room-mate and friend [[Giovanni Battista Caproni]], he built the Coand<U+0103>-Caproni box glider, based on the plans of gliders designed by [[Otto Lilienthal]] and [[Octave Chanute]] which he previously studied at [[Charlottenburg]] and Spandau.<ref name="CoandaMonograph2010">Antoniu ''et al'' (2010).</ref> In 1909 he was employed as technical director of the Li<U+00E8>ge-Spa Aeroclub, and at the end of that year, with the help of car manufacturer Joachim he built the Coand<U+0103>-Joachim glider.<ref name="L'Express">{{cite journal |date=16 September 1909 |journal=L'Express |location=Li<U+00E8>ge |language=French |page=3}}</ref> Caproni was present when the glider was flown at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa-Malchamps]], Belgium.<ref name="Samedi-Soire">{{cite journal |date=October 1955 |journal=Samedi-Soire |language=French}}</ref>

As a continuation of his Belgium experiments, and especially looking for a way to test wing [[airfoil]]s at higher speeds, he contacted [[Ernest Archdeacon]], the co-founder of [[A<U+00E9>ro-Club de France|''L'Aero-Club de France'']], who in turn directed Coand<U+0103> to [[Gustav Eiffel]] and [[Paul Painlev<U+00E9>]]. With their assistance, he gained approval to test different wing configurations and air resistance on a platform built by Eiffel at the front of a locomotive on the North of France railway. In March, he started flying lessons at Reims with a [[Rene Hanriot|Hanriot]] monoplane.<ref name="L'Aerophile15Apr1910">{{cite journal |author=A.

These experiments resulted in the creation of the first jet propulsion assembly for aircraft, working on the [[Reaction engine|reaction]] principle.<ref name="Antoniu53b">Antoniu (2010), p. 53. "The project that he arrived by departing from this above-mentioned concept represents a propulsion assembly for aeroplanes, with a jet effect, comprising a radial compressor powered by an internal combustion engine by means of a rotation multiplier with ratio of 1:4, an assembly that formed a 'motorfan', the ancestor of the current turbofan. The invention was given the name 'propeller' in the patent application and in the documentation it was given the name 'turbo-propeller'. ('Turbo' was a term that described a rotor turning at high speeds of rotation)."</ref>

Coand<U+0103> exhibited the aircraft 15 October <U+2013> 2 November 1910 at the [[Paris Air Show#History|Second International Aeronautical Exhibition]], an annual event commonly referred to in aviation magazines as the Paris salon, or Paris flight salon. Together with [[Henri Fabre]]'s [[Fabre Hydravion|''Hydravion'']], the first [[floatplane]], the aircraft and devices used for aerodynamic experiments were placed "in solitary state" in an upstairs gallery, separated from the series of aircraft on the main exhibit floor.<ref name="FlightGlobal 1910 p881-883">{{Cite journal |title=Impressions of the Paris Air Show |journal=[[Flight (magazine)|Flight]] |author=Oiseau |date=29 October 1910 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%200883.html |pages=881<U+2014>883 |quote=The Coanda a large monoplane constructed entirely of wood, has in place of the customary propeller a turbine, or remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine.

The aircraft construction was a novelty for the time. In contrast to the monoplane described in the July 1910 patent application,<ref name="FR418401A"/> the exhibit was a sesquiplane, which complicated the construction, but in return solved lateral stability control issues. The [[Cantilevered wing|cantilevered wings]] were held in place at three points by tubular steel struts without any bracing from [[flying wires]]. According to Coand<U+0103>'s description the wings were built with metal spars, but existing photographs of the construction show a completely wooden internal structure. The trailing edges of the upper wing could be twisted separately or together for lateral control or braking during landing, and were controlled by pedals in the two-seat open cockpit.<ref name="CoandaMonograph2010"/> The fuselage, painted reddish-brown and highly polished, was described by ''The Technical World'' magazine as having a framework of steel;<ref name="TheTechnicalWorld">{{cite journal |year=1911 |title=Exposition of aerial locomotion

A remarkable feature of the aircraft was its powerplant. Instead of a [[propeller]], a 50&nbsp;hp (37&nbsp;kW) in-line water-cooled reciprocating internal combustion engine built by [[Pierre Clerget]] at a [[Cl<U+00E9>ment-Bayard]] workshop with funding from ''L'Aero-Club de France'',<ref name="Pierre Clerget">{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=G<U+00E9>rard |title=Pierre Clerget, 1875<U+2013>1943: un motoriste de g<U+00E9>nie |year=2004 |publisher=Editions de l'officine |page=126 |language=French |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=gMTPTKFoxpg6qM_cvgU&ct=result&id=lkDbAAAAMAAJ&dq=clerget+coanda&q=coanda#search_anchor}}</ref> placed in the forward section of the fuselage, drove a rotary compressor through a 1:4 gearbox (1,000&nbsp;rpm on the Clerget turned the compressor at 4,000&nbsp;rpm) which drew air in from the front and expelled it rearward under compression and with added heat. The compressor, with a diameter of 50&nbsp;[[centimetre]]s (20&nbsp;[[inch|in]]), was located within a cowling at the front of the fuselage. According to later Coand<U+0103> descriptions, cast aluminium components were also made by Clerget to create a powerplant with a weight of 2.8&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (1.3&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]) per horsepower (equivalent to a [[power-to-weight ratio]] of 0.36&nbsp;hp/lb), a considerable achievement at the time.<ref name="Flying 1956">{{cite journal |month=May |year=1956 |publisher=Ziff-Davis |journal=Flying |volume=58<U+2013>59 |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=Ob3dTPGcIpHHswbX9d2WDA&ct=result&id=onUPAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22inventive+genius+Clerget+offered+me+an+engine+that+weighed%22&q=Clerget#search_anchor |last=Caidin |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Caidin |title=The Coanda Story |pages=32<U+2013>33, 50, 54, 56, 58}}</ref>

Coand<U+0103>'s 1910s-era patents describe the inline piston engine's exhaust gases as being routed through heating channels or heat exchangers in contact with the central air flow, then sucked into the compressor inlet to reduce back-pressure on the engine while adding more heat and mass to the air flow.<ref name="Winter1980"/> The "turbo-propulseur" as Coand<U+0103> called it in the exhibition leaflet, was claimed to be capable of generating 220&nbsp;[[Kilogram-force]] (2,157&nbsp;[[Newton (unit)|N]]; 485&nbsp;[[Pound-force|lbf]]) of thrust.<ref name="1910 Coanda brochure"/> The powerplant was referred to in reports at the time by different terms: a turbine without propellers,<ref name="FlightGlobal 1910 p881-883"/><ref name="TheTechnicalWorld"/> turbo-propulseur,<ref name="Laerophile">{{cite journal |journal=L'Aerophile |date=15 November 1910 |page=510 |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/larophile18besa#page/510/mode/1up/ }}</ref> ducted fan<ref name="Flug- und Motor-Technik1910">{{cite journal |date=10 December 1910 |journal=Flug- und Motor-Technik |publisher=<U+00D6>sterreichischen Flugtechnischen Vereins (Austrian Aerotechnical Society) |location=Vienna |language=German}} The article included two sectional drawings of the engine.</ref> or a suction turbine.<ref name="PopMech1911">{{cite journal |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=At4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA359 |work=Popular Mechanics |title=Suction Turbines Serve As Air Propellers |month=March |year=1911 |page=359}}</ref>

Aviation reporters from ''The Aero'' and ''La Technique Aeronautique'' were doubtful that the powerplant could provide sufficient thrust.<ref name="Winter1980"/> The engine was noted in ''The Aero'', reprinted in ''Aircraft'', as being "of remarkably small proportions in relation to the size of the machine."<ref name="FlightGlobal 1910 p881-883"/><ref name="Aircraft1910">{{cite journal |year=1910 |journal=Aircraft |volume=1 |page=367}}</ref> and "claimed to give an enormous wind velocity", but the intake area seemed too small to produce the stated thrust, and that "it also appears as if enormous power would be necessary to drive it",<ref name="Aircraft, The Aero, 1910">{{cite journal |date=December 1910 |title=Features of the Paris Air Show: From "The Aero", London

At the exhibition, reaction among observers was mixed. Some doubted the aircraft would fly,<ref name="Aircraft, The Aero, 1910"/> and focused on more likely machines such as the Sloan, the [[A<U+00E9>roplanes Voisin|Voisin]], or the [[Louis Paulhan]] construction of a [[Henri Fabre]] machine. Others gave special notice to the Coand<U+0103>-1910, calling it original and ingenious.<ref name="Winter1980"/> The reporter from ''La Technique Aeronautique'' wrote, "In the absence of definitive trials, permitting the precise yield of this machine, it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propeller&nbsp;... the tentative is interesting and we watch it closely."<ref name="Winter1980"/> The official exhibition report ignored the 'turbo-propulseur' engine and instead described Coand<U+0103>'s novel wing design, and the unusual empennage.<ref name="Winter1980"/> On 15 November 1910, ''L'A<U+00E9>rophile'' wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor hoped, it would be "a beautiful dream".<ref name="Winter1980"/>

They felt that the exhibition machine had a simpler director system, a different rotor with a smaller intake cone, and that the exhaust gas heat transfer system had not been implemented.<ref name="Antoniu55">Antoniu (2010), pp. 55<U+2013>59.

Henri Mirguet writing for ''L'A<U+00E9>rophile'' magazine in January 1912, recalled the previous exhibition's machine as the "chief attraction" of the 1910 salon.<ref name="Winter1980"/> He wrote that Coand<U+0103> answered his "pressing<U+2014>and indiscreet<U+2014>questions" about the 'turbo-propulseur'-powered aircraft at that earlier exhibit, telling him that the machine had attained a speed of 112&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]] (70&nbsp;[[Miles per hour|mph]]) during several "flight tests", an improbable answer about which Mirguet "reserved judgment", waiting for confirmation that never materialised.<ref name=Winter1980/>

Coand<U+0103> continued to work on the Coand<U+0103>-1910 project at the beginning of 1911, aiming to improve stability, increase the power of the 'turbo-propulseur', and to implement airfoil improvements.

Coand<U+0103> described a different, more sturdy system for the attachment of the wings, which also enabled changes in the [[angle of attack]] and the centre of gravity. He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled [[rotary engine]]s on the sides of the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coand<U+0103> did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it, as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised.<ref name="Antoniu85">Antoniu (2010) p. 85. "One relevant aspect must be noted in the relation to the entire propulsion system that demonstrates that the reaction force was obtained only with air under pressure (motofan) like the engines of modern planes. In the case in which fuel was introduced in the exhaust channel, the hot gases would have enveloped the two rotary engines depriving them of the necessary cooling."</ref> The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes, for instance retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids. The horizontal stabiliser was removed, a supporting surface was provided for each engine, and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics.<ref name=Antoniu88>Antoniu (2010), p. 88. "Major changes were made to the landing gear; he fitted them with dampeners and retraction mechanisms, the whole assembly being located inside aerodynamic pants with skids.

The very expensive project of 1910 "which cost some one million francs of Coanda's own money", left Coand<U+0103> with limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coand<U+0103> to build the Coand<U+0103>-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy.<ref name="Winter1980"/><ref name="Antoniu92">Antoniu (2010), p. 92. "In 1911, the French army announced a competition to be held in October in Reims to equip its aviation with flying machines.

The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version was not adequate for the new configuration, so the forward chassis had to be modified.<ref name="Antoniu93">Antoniu (2010), p. 93. "During the tests, the two-bladed propeller did not provide the necessary traction either, even though there was a reserve of power in the engines. In these conditions, he used a four-blade propeller made by joining two two-blade propellers. As the results were acceptable, he ordered a four-blade one-piece propeller. The chassis, with two coupled engines, created for the reactive propulsion version, was not adequate for the new machine, so he build a frontal chassis that extended into a latticed truss that formed the load-bearing structure of the fuselage."</ref>
Henri Mirguet writing for ''L'A<U+00E9>rophile'' magazine in January 1912 said that the new 1911 aircraft retained the fuselage, the frame and the wing of Coand<U+0103>'s 1910 design, but did not keep the 'turbo-propulseur' or "the wooden wingloading surface including the forward longitudinal ribs". The aircraft was flown on 21 October 1911, but with modest results as the latest modifications, especially those related to the powerplant, did not compensate for the increased total weight of the aircraft. At the military contest, it did not meet the requirements for independent operation of each engine.<ref name="Antoniu19">Antoniu (2010), pp. 19, 103<U+2013>104.

Following the 1911 exhibition, at the personal request of [[George White (businessman)|Sir George White]], Coand<U+0103> moved to the United Kingdom to take a position as chief engineer or chief designer at [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|British and Colonial Aeroplane Company]] for a few years. In the next four decades, Coand<U+0103> worked on a great variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier 'turbo-propulseur' engine: he was contracted by the German [[Heer (1935-1945)|Army]] in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sleds much like the one made for the Russian Grand Duke.<ref name="Augmented Flow 1946">{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201600.html |title=Augmented Flow |journal=[[Flight (magazine)|Flight]] |date=15 August 1946 |page=174}}</ref> The German contract concluded after one year yielding no plans for production. Though Coand<U+0103> had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.<ref name="Augmented Flow 1946"/>

Coand<U+0103> and his 1910 aircraft were absent from much of aviation literature of the day. None of the annual issues of ''[[Jane's All the World's Aircraft]]'' ever mentioned the Coand<U+0103>-1910 or its 'turbo-propulseur' powerplant.<ref name="Winter1980"/> As well, the Soviet engineer [[Nikolai Rynin]] did not mention Coand<U+0103> at all in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early '30s.<ref name="Winter1980"/>

==Later claims==
At the beginning of the [[jet age]], when the potential of reactive engines was recognised, a number of histories of the jet engine were written. A once-classified [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] study completed in 1946 described the Coand<U+0103>-1910 as "probably not flown" but featuring "a mechanical jet propulsion device with a centrifugal blower", one in which heat from the Clerget piston engine "furnished auxiliary jet propulsion."<ref name="Winter1980"/>

In ''Jet Age Airlanes'' of 1956, Coand<U+0103> himself published an article entitled "The First Jet Flight". He submitted the same text that Caidin had written for ''Flying'' in May:

{{Quote|"In December, we brought the air<U+00AD>plane out of its hangar at Issy-les-Mouli<U+00AD>neaux and, after a bit of coaxing, started the motor. I must admit that I was never a very outstanding pilot. I always seemed unable to shake off a vague apprehension and, that morning, in addition to my usual uneasiness, I was rather excited. I climbed into the cockpit, accelerated the motor, and felt the power from the jet thrust straining the plane forward. I gave the signal to remove the wheel blocks, and the plane started moving slowly ahead. I had anticipated that I would not attempt to fly today, but would make only ground tests on the small field at Issy-les-Moulineaux. The controls seemed too loose to me, so I injected fuel into the turbine. Too much! In a moment I was surrounded by flames! I had to cut back and reduce my power quickly. I worked the throttle and the flames subsided. Only then did I have oppor<U+00AD>tunity to lift my head. I saw that the plane had gained speed, and that the walls of the ancient fortifications border<U+00AD>ing the field were lunging toward me. I pulled back on the stick, only much too hard.

This fan was fitted right across the machine's nose and the cowling covered the nose and part of the engine: the resulting 'jet' of plain air was to propel the aeroplane."<ref name="Gibbs-Smith book 1960"/> He wrote that "no claims that it flew, or was even tested, were made at the time", and that the story of it flying suddenly appeared in the 1950s<ref name="Gibbs-Smith book 1960"/><U+2014>the aircraft was thus "disinterred from its obscurity."<ref name="Gibbs-Smith correspondence"/> He wrote that the airfield at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a former military exercise ground where the test supposedly took place, was under the constant observation of the French Army who owned it, and under observation by French aviation reporters and photographers, and by aviation experts from other countries. He said that the airfield was the "most famous, most used, most observed, and most reported-on 'airfield' in Paris", and that all events, let alone an exciting crash and destruction by fire, would have been carried in local papers, and described in military reports, but no contemporary accounts exist of the Coand<U+0103>-1910 being tested, flown or destroyed.<ref name="Gibbs-Smith book 1960"/> Gibbs-Smith countered the Coand<U+0103> assertions point by point, saying that the aircraft did not have retractable undercarriage, did not have leading or trailing edge wing slots, did not have a fuel tank overhead in the wing, and did not have fuel injected into any turbine. Gibbs-Smith pointed out that the pilot would have been killed by the heat if any combustion had been initiated in the engine's air stream.<ref name="Gibbs-Smith book 1960"/>

In 1970 Gibbs-Smith wrote another account of the Coanda-1910, using much the same phrasing as in 1960:
{{Quote|"Another unsuccessful, but prophetic, machine was the Coanda biplane (strictly speaking a sesquiplane) exhibited at the Paris Salon in October. It was of all-<U+00AD>wood construction, with fully cantilevered wings<U+2014>which did not look very robust<U+2014>and an ''Antoinette''-like fuselage with obliquely cruciform tail-unit; it was equipped with a reaction propulsion unit consisting of a 50&nbsp;hp Clerget engine driving a large ducted fan in front of it, the latter enclosed in a cowling which covered the nose of the machine and part of the engine: the fan was a simple air-fan driving back the air to form the propulsive 'jet'. Although inevitably earth-bound, this aircraft stands as the first full-size attempt at a jet-propelled aeroplane."<ref name="Gibbs-Smith 1970">Gibbs-Smith (1970), p. 156.</ref>
}}

In 2010, Antoniu wrote that he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated on the basis of the [[evidence of absence]] that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coand<U+0103> in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, and that he did not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.<ref name="Antoniu88"/><ref name="Antoniu97">Antoniu (2010), p. 97. "The Coand<U+0103> No. 2 machine of 1911 preparing for flight before the Reims military competition of 21 October 1911, pilot Boutiny sits in the cockpit (Michel Marani Collection)"</ref>

[[File:Coanda 1911 patent.jpg|thumb|Coand<U+0103>'s US patent diagram for "Improvement in Propellers", filed 1911 and granted 1914]]
In 1980, NASM historian [[Frank H. Winter]] examined the 1965 drawings and specifications Coand<U+0103> prepared while at Huyck Corporation, and wrote an article about Coand<U+0103>'s claim: "There is a wholly new description of the inner workings of the machine that does not occur in any of the accounts given [in the 1910s] and which defies all of the patent specifications."<ref name="Winter1980">{{cite journal |last=Winter |first=Frank H. |title=Ducted Fan or the World's First Jet Plane? The Coanda claim re-examined |work=The Aeronautical Journal |publisher=Royal Aeronautical Society |volume=84 |month=December |year=1980 |pages=408<U+2013>416 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XkBWAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> He said Coand<U+0103> told various conflicting stories about his claimed 1910 flight, and that Coand<U+0103> produced a set of altered drawings as proof of his claims: {{Quote|"The differences between this version of Coanda's story and his earlier one are marked and hardly need to be pointed out; though the obvious ones are: the planned versus the completely accidental and unintentional flight; the immediate flight versus the busy taxiing about the field; Coanda being thrown from the plane after it stalled versus Coanda pitched forward after landing, and so on. Apart from his personal recollections, Henri Coanda also bestowed upon the museum some drawings and illustrations of his turbo-propulseur. The drawings, purporting to show internal details of the machine, are unfortunately modern. That is to say, they were obviously executed in the 1960s, not in 1910 or 1911; worse, the fuel injection outlet tubes into the aft end of the turbine seems to be an even later addition to the original drawings. In brief, the drawings by themselves do not constitute evidence in Coanda's claim."<ref name="Winter1980"/>}}

In his article, Winter wondered why Coand<U+0103> did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature had been present during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were essentially the same as the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air ''or water'' flowing through the device. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents of asbestos or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.<ref name="Winter1980"/>

While looking through aviation periodicals and Paris newspapers reporting for the month of December, 1910, Winter found that there was a spell of bad weather at Issy during which no flying took place. This situation occurred mid-month, the period covering the conflicting dates (10 and 16 December) that Coand<U+0103> said his aircraft was tested, flown and crashed.<ref name="Winter1980"/> In their regular "Foreign Aviation News" column, ''Flight'' magazine reported that the "blank period" of inclement weather at Issy ended on the 19th when Guillaume Busson tested a monoplane made by Armand Deperdussin.<ref name="Flight, 31 December 1910">{{cite journal |date=31 December 1910 |title=Foreign Aviation News: Doings at Issy. |journal=[[Flight (magazine)|Flight]] |location=London |volume=2 |issue=53 |page=1082 |quote=During last week, after a blank period due to the inclement weather, a good deal of flying was carried out at Issy. |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1910/1910%20-%201084.html |accessdate=1 December 2010}}</ref> Other aircraft tests and piloting activities were listed, with no mention of Coand<U+0103> or his machine.<ref name="Flight, 31 December 1910"/>

Winter found that Camille (or Cosimo) Canovetti, an Italian civil and aviation engineer, had been working on a 'turbo-propulseur' aviation engine before Coand<U+0103>, and had attempted to show an aircraft with such an engine at the Aviation Exposition in Milan in 1909. Canovetti took out patents on his machine in 1909, and more in 1910.<ref name="Winter1980"/> Canovetti wrote in 1911 that the 1910 appearance of the Coand<U+0103> engine "called general attention" to designs like his. <ref name="Winter1980"/>

==After Coand<U+0103>'s death==
Modern reference books about aviation history represent the Coand<U+0103>-1910 in various ways, though many do not mention the machine or the inventor at all. Others acknowledge Coand<U+0103> as the discoverer of the [[Coand<U+0103> effect]] but give [[Hans von Ohain]] the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight, and [[Frank Whittle]] the honour of completing and patenting the first jet engine capable of such flight.<ref>{{cite book |last=El-Sayed |first=Ahmed F. |title=Aircraft propulsion and gas turbine engines |year=2003 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-9196-5}}</ref> In their 1994 book ''American Aviation'', authors Joe Christy and LeRoy Cook state that Coand<U+0103>'s 1910 aircraft was the first jet.<ref>Christy & LeRoy (1994), pp. 337<U+2013>338.</ref>

Aviation author [[Bill Gunston]] changed his mind two years after a 1993 book where he gave Coand<U+0103> credit for the first jet engine. Gunston's 1995 description began: "Romanian Henri Coanda built a biplane with a Clerget inline piston engine which, instead of turning a propeller, drove a centrifugal compressor blowing air to the rear. The thrust was said to be 220&nbsp;kilograms [490&nbsp;lb], a figure the author disbelieves. On 10 December 1910 the aircraft thus powered inadvertently became airborne, crashed and burned. Often called 'a turbine aeroplane', this was of no more significance than the Campini aircraft mentioned later, and Coanda wisely decided to switch to a propeller."<ref name="Gunston1995">{{cite book |last=Gunston |first=Bill |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=GqeWTPPCIYWx4QbzuoSPDg&ct=result&id=joBTAAAAMAAJ&dq=bill+gunston+jet&q=coanda#search_anchor |title=The Development of Jet and Turbine Aero Engines |year=1995 |page=118}}</ref> In his publication of 1998 <U+2013> ''World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines: All major aircraft power plants, from the Wright brothers to the present day'' <U+2013> Gunston did not include Coanda; nor did he include Coanda in 2005's ''Jane's Aero-Engines'' or 2006's ''World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines''.

[[Walter J. Boyne]], director of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] and a prolific aviation author (more than 40 non-fiction books and 1,000 magazine articles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wingsoverkansas.com/profiles/article.asp?id=283 |title=A Biography of Walter J. Boyne |work=Aviation Pioneers |publisher=Wings Over Kansas |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>) mentions Coand<U+0103> in passing a few times in his works. Boyne discusses Coand<U+0103> briefly in one of his books, ''The Leading Edge'': "Professor Henri Coanda, whose scientific work was impeccable, designed and built a jet aircraft in 1910; it, like [[Martin KF-1|Martin's Kitten]], was superbly built and technically advanced<U+2014>and could not fly."<ref name="Boyne1994">{{cite book |last=Boyne |first=Walter J. |authorlink=Walter J.

It was equipped with what today might be called an afterburner, producing an estimated 500&nbsp;pounds [230&nbsp;kg] of thrust. Countless loyal Coanda fans insist that the airplane flew.

In 1980 and 1993, ''Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation'' included an entry on the 1910 aircraft, calling it the "Coanda turbine" and describing it as "the world's first jet-propelled aircraft to fly".<ref name="Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation">{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Michael John Haddrick |title=Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation |url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=cVbaTMXbO4PtOfnGuJYJ&ct=result&id=P6NTAAAAMAAJ&dq=coanda+encyclopedia&q=coanda+#search_anchor |volume=2 |year=1980 |publisher=Grolier Educational Corporation |isbn=978-0-7106-0710-2 |page=406}}</ref> In 2003, Winter co-authored a book with fellow NASM curator F. Robert van der Linden: ''100 Years of Flight: A Chronicle of Aerospace History, 1903<U+2013>2003''.

Citing Carl A. Brown's 1985 ''A History of Aviation'', Tim Brady, the Dean of Aviation at [[Embry<U+2013>Riddle Aeronautical University]], wrote in 2000: "the development of the jet is, broadly, the story of three men: Henri Coanda, Sir Frank Whittle, and Pabst von Ohain..."<ref name=Brady2000/> His description of Coand<U+0103>'s disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor's vent, with the detail that the aircraft "flew for about a thousand feet [300&nbsp;m] before crashing into a wall."<ref name=Brady2000>Brady (2000), p. 166. Brady cites Carl A. Brown's ''A History of Aviation'', page 140, as his source.</ref> In 1990 at the 24th Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics, one of the papers presented included this sentence: "It is to Henri Coanda (1886<U+2013>1972), a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight, that space engineering owes<U+2014>beside one of the first model planes provided with a rocket engine (1905)<U+2014>the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft, the 'Coanda-1910'."<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=CYpTAAAAMAAJ&q=Coanda+1910+first+jet+aircraft&dq=Coanda+1910+first+jet+aircraft&hl=en&ei=I1t9TMnOAtOQjAedztzSDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg History of rocketry and astronautics: proceedings of the twenty-fourth Symposium of the International Academy of Astronautics, Dresden, Germany, 1990], Volume 19 of AAS history series, 2007, ISBN 087703423, p. 107</ref> In 2007 in his popular book ''Extreme Aircraft'', Ron Miller wrote that the powerplant in the Coand<U+0103>-1910 was one of the "earliest attempts" at a jet engine, but was unsuccessful<U+2014>it was "incapable of actual flight", unlike the engines designed by Whittle and Ohain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Ron |title=Extreme Aircraft |series=The Extreme Wonders Series |year=2007 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-089141-1 |page=66}}</ref> The question of the Coand<U+0103>-1910 being the first jet aircraft does not appear to be resolved, supporting Stine's view: "Whether Henri Coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably."<ref name="Rises and Falls"/>

In the 2000s, Dan Antoniu and other Romanian aviation experts investigated existing photographs of the Coand<U+0103>-1910, leading them to believe that the aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished, that it was exhibited with many improvisations. Antoniu published ''Henri Coand<U+0103> and his technical work during 1906<U+2013>1918'', a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to Coand<U+0103> filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy. For instance, Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the Clerg<U+00E9>t engine appeared free; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent, and there were no heat shields for crew protection. As well, the central attachment of the tubular struts holding the wings to the fuselage, with mere collars secured with screws, was judged by Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take-off or landing because of the "considerable loads on the struts". The X-shaped empennage was covered at high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable, and any high-speed taxi would put the machine in danger of a nose-over.<ref name=Antoniu66>Antoniu (2010), pp. 66, 72, 79. "This method of attachment, without any cross-braces, mounted in the flight direction of the machine, was unsafe during take-off or landing as it produced considerable loads in the struts.&nbsp;... By studying the existing photos, we can notice that the openings for the discharge of hot gases from the cylinders of the internal combustion engine were free, and were not fitted with any eventual devices directing gases along the fuselage in order to protect the crew.&nbsp;... The photographs show us an unfinished machine, with many visible improvisations."</ref>
