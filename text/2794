'''Anker J<U+00F8>rgensen''' (born [[July 13]], [[1922]]) is a former [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Prime Minister]] and [[Foreign Minister]]. He represented the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democratic Party]].

J<U+00F8>rgensen was born in [[Copenhagen]]. He held several leading positions in the [[trade union|unions]] before his political career. He was the chairman of the Danish Workers Union, SiD, between 1968 and 1972.

He became a member of the [[Copenhagen]] Council in 1961 and held a seat until 1964, when he became a member of the Danish parliament ([[Folketinget]]). He would remain a member for thirty years, until 1994.

In [[1972]] he succeeded [[Jens Otto Krag]] as leader of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democratic Party]]. He was the [[prime minister of Denmark]] between [[1972]] and [[1973]], and again from [[1975]] until [[1982]]. For a brief period of two months in [[1978]] he concurrently held the position of foreign minister.

J<U+00F8>rgensen stepped down as prime minister on [[September 10]], [[1982]] due to the uncertain parliamentary situation. He stepped down as the leader of the SDP in [[1987]] and was succeeded by [[Svend Auken]]. 

He was the head of Danish delegation to the [[Nordic Council]]. J<U+00F8>rgensen was elected "Dane Of The Year" in [[1990]]. He has written several autobiographies.
