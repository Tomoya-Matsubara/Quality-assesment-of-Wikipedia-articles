The '''upper nobility''' ({{lang-hu|f<U+0151>nemess<U+00E9>g}}, {{lang-la|barones}}) was the highest [[Social stratification|stratum]] of the [[temporal]] [[society]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] until the 20th century. In the course of the 11-15th centuries, only people who held specific high offices in the royal [[Public administration|administration]] or in the [[Royal Household]]s were distinguished by law within the [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|nobility]], but from the 16th century, families whose ancestors had been authorized by the [[monarch]]s to use a distinctive noble title (''e.g.'', [[baron]], [[count]]) formed a hereditary [[social class]].

Its first members descended from the leaders of the [[Magyar tribes]] and [[clans]] and from the western [[knight]]s who immigrated to the Kingdom of Hungary in the course of the 10-12th centuries. They were the "men distinguished by birth and dignity" ''(maiores natu et dignitate)'' mentioned frequently in the charters of the first [[King of Hungary|kings]]. From the 1210s, the dignitaries of the central administration and the Royal Households were referred to as "barons of the realm" ''(barones regni)'' in official documents but their [[legal]] status was exclusively linked to the office they held and their offsprings could not inherit it.

In 1193, King [[B<U+00E9>la III of Hungary|B<U+00E9>la III]] granted [[Modru<U+0161>-Rijeka|Modru<U+0161> county]] in Croatia to [[Frankopans|Bartolomej]], the ancestor of the Frankopans ''(Frangep<U+00E1>n)'' family; thenceforward, he and his descendants used the hereditary title ''count'' but no specific privileges were connected to it. Quite to the contrary, the theory of the "[[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary#The age of chivalry - 14th century#The Act of 1351|one and same liberty]]" ''(una eademque libertas)'' of the [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|nobles]] strengthened and finally, it became [[Promulgation|enacted]] in 1351. From 1397, the descendants of the "barons of the realm" were referred to as "barons' sons" ''(filii baronum)'' or [[magnate]]s ''(magnates)'' in official documents and from the 1430s, they received the [[honorific]] ''magnificus'', an expression that had earlier been used only when addressing the "barons of the realm".

Besides the Counts Frankopan, the members of foreign [[Dynasty|ruling houses]] and the nobles of foreign origin who held offices in the royal administration or owned estates in the Kingdom of Hungary (''e.g.'', Duke [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Opolczyk|Ladislaus of Opole]], Prince [[Fyodor Koriatovych]], the ''[[Despot (court title)|Despot]]'' [[Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107>]] and Count [[Hermann II of Celje]]) were the first individuals who used noble titles, but in theory, their legal status was still equal to that of the poorest members of the [[Lesser nobility (Kingdom of Hungary)|lesser nobility]]. Similarly, the status of the brothers [[Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi]] did not change when they were rewarded with the hereditary title ''count of the Roman Empire'' in 1459 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] who had been claiming the throne for himself against King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias I]].

[[File:Castelul Huniazilor.jpg|thumb||250px|left|The [[Huniade Castle|Hunyadi Castle]] in [[Timi<U+015F>oara|Temesv<U+00E1>r]] (today ''Timi<U+015F>oara'' in [[Romania]]), built in the 15th century]]
King Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles when he appointed them to hereditary heads of counties ''(h<U+00E6>reditarius supremus comes)'' and authorized them to use red [[sealing wax]] (similarly to the counts of the Roman Empire). In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of [[armistice]] signed by King Matthias: the document mentioned 19 noble families as "natural barons in Hungary" ''(barones naturales in Hungaria)'' in contrast to the "barons of the realm" whose position was still linked to the high offices they happened to be holding. During the reign of King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], the special legal position of certain noble families was enacted and the act referred to their members  as "barons" even if they were not holding any high offices at that time.

Although in the 16th century, the ''[[Tripartitum]]'' (a law book collecting the body of common laws that had arisen from customary practise) declared again that all the nobles enjoyed the same liberties independently of their offices, birth or wealth, but in practise, even it acknowledged that some differences had been existing within the nobility. Nevertheless, the ''Tripartitum'' still distinguished between the "true barons" ''(veri barones)'' who held the highest offices and the "barons only by name" ''(barones solo nomine)'' who did not hold any high offices but used noble titles.  From 1526, the [[Habsburg]] kings rewarded their partisans with hereditary titles such as ''baron'' and ''count'' and the members of the families wearing such titles were invited to attend in person at the [[Diet (assembly)|Diets]]. This costumary practise was confirmed by [[legislation]] in 1608, when the Diet passed an [[Act of Parliament|act]] prescribing that the [[monarch]]s were to send a personal invitation to the members of the upper nobility (''i.e.'', to the "true barons" and to the nobles authorized by the kings to use hereditary titles) when convoking the Diet; thenceforward, the [[prelate]]s and the members of the upper nobility formed the Diets' [[Upper House]].

The Habsburg monarchs endeavoured to establish an "international" aristocracy within [[Habsburg Monarchy|their empire]] and they granted several estates in the Kingdom of Hungary to their followers descending from their other realms and provinces; the Estates, however, managed to reserve the right that the kings could not grant offices and estates to foreigners without their authorization. From 1688, the members of the upper nobility were entitled by law to create an [[fee tail|entail]] ''(fideicommissum)'' which ensured that their estates were inherited without division in contrast to the common law that prescribed that a noble's inheritance was to be divided equally among his heirs.

[[File:Festeticscastlehungary100.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Festetics Palace]] in [[Keszthely]], built in the 18-19th centuries]]
The "[[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary#The emerging power of the Estates - 15-16th centuries#The "cardinal liberties" of the nobility - The Tripartitum|cardinal liberties]]" of the nobility were abolished by the "[[April laws]]" in 1848, but the members of the upper nobility could reserve their hereditary membership in the Upper House of the Parliament. In 1885, aristocrats who did not meet all the financial criteria set up by legislation, lost their seat in the legislative body. The Upper House was dissolved in 1918 and it was reorganized only in 1926, but thenceforward, the members of the upper nobility were only entitled to elect some representatives to the Upper House.

In 1945, the [[land reform]] liquidated the financial basis of the special status of the upper nobility. And finally, following the declaration of the [[Republic of Hungary]], the Parliament passed an act that prohibited the use of noble titles in 1946.
== The tribal aristocracy (9th<U+2013>11th centuries) ==
In the 9th century, the tribal federation of the [[nomadic]] [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] ''(Hetumoger)'' was composed of seven (and later, after the [[Kabar]]s had joined to it, of eight) [[Magyar tribes|tribes]] ({{lang-hu|t<U+00F6>rzs}}, {{Lang-el|phyle}}).<ref name='Encyclopedia'>{{cite book | last = Krist<U+00F3> | first = Gyula (editor)| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Korai Magyar T<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>neti Lexikon - 9-14. sz<U+00E1>zad ''(Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History - 9-14th centuries)''| publisher = Akad<U+00E9>miai Kiad<U+00F3> | year = 1994 | location = Budapest | pages = 262, 312, 688| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 963 05 6722 9}}</ref> The tribes were divided into 35-50 [[clan]]s ({{lang-hu|nemzets<U+00E9>g}}, {{Lang-el|genea}}).<ref name='Encyclopedia'>{{cite book | pages = 488<U+2013>489}}</ref> The Magyar clans must have been organized based on the real or fictitious [[kinship]] of their members; each of them had its own name (that may have been changing from time to time) and the clans possessed separate territories within the lands occupied by the tribe they were linked to.<ref name='From Levedia'>{{cite book | last = T<U+00F3>th | first = S<U+00E1>ndor L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Levedi<U+00E1>t<U+00F3>l a K<U+00E1>rp<U+00E1>t-medenc<U+00E9>ig ''("From Levedia to the Carpathian Basin")'' | publisher = Szegedi K<U+00F6>z<U+00E9>pkor<U+00E1>sz M<U+0171>hely | year = 1998 | location = Szeged | pages = 80<U+2013>82| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 963 482 175 8}}</ref> In the 9th-10th centuries, the ''[[kende]]'', the ''[[Gyula (title)|gyula]]'' and the ''[[horka]]'' were the leaders of the Magyar tribal federation, while the tribes were headed by their own princes and each clan must have also had its own head.<ref name='Encyclopedia'>{{cite book | pages = 245, 269, 389}}</ref><ref name='From Levedia'>{{cite book | pages = 79<U+2013>89}}</ref>

Although King Stephen I made a concerted effort to strengthen the position of [[Christianity]] in his kingdom and he adopted severe measures against the followers of [[pagan]] customs, but several Magyar tribal leaders (including the king's nephew [[Levente]], who died as a pagan around 1046) did not give up their former [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].<ref name='History of Hungary I.'>{{cite book | page = 153}}</ref>

On the other hand, the [[Christian]] missionaries' efforts were not in vain, and several members of the tribal aristocracy (''e.g.'', Csan<U+00E1>d, one of Ajtony's former military leaders) became an ardent advocate of the Christianity; and finally, all of them who could reserve their estates integrated into the upper stratum of the Christian society following the period of the internal wars in the 1040s.<ref name='Encyclopedia'>{{cite book | page = 145}}</ref><ref name="History of Hungary I."/>

Following the death of King Louis I, his daughter Queen [[Mary of Hungary|Mary I]] (1382<U+2013>1385, 1386<U+2013>1395) acceded to the throne, but the majority of the nobles opposed her rule.<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | pages = 123}}</ref> In 1385, the young queen had to abdicate in favor of her distant cousin, King [[Charles III of Naples|Charles II]] (1385<U+2013>1386), but her partisans murdered the new king soon and thus she could ascend the throne again.<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | pages = 124}}</ref> However, the followers of her murdered opponent's son, King [[Ladislaus of Naples]] rose up in open rebellion and captured her; thus the realm stayed without a monarch.<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | pages = 125}}</ref>

At that moment, the prelates and the "barons of the realm" set up a council; they have a seal prepared with the inscription "Seal of the People of the Kingdom of Hungary" ({{lang-la|Sigillum regnicolarum regni Hungari<U+00E6>}}) and issued decrees sealed by it in the name of the "prelates, barons, notabilities and all nobles of the realm".<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | pages = 285<U+2013>286}}</ref> The members of the council entered into a contract with Queen Mary's fianc<U+00E9> and elected him king; in the contract, King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] (1387<U+2013>1437) accepted that his{{Quote|''counsillors shall be the prelates, the barons, their offsprings and heirs, of those who used to be the counsillors of the kings of Hungary''<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 288}}</ref>}}

The [[public law]] of the kingdom also started to differentiate the descendants of the "barons of the realm", even if they did not held any higher offices, from other nobles: the Act of 1397 referred to them as the "barons' sons" ({{lang-hu|b<U+00E1>r<U+00F3>fi}}, {{lang-la|filii baronum}}) while later documents called them "'''[[magnate]]s'''" ({{lang-hu|m<U+00E1>gn<U+00E1>s}}, {{lang-la|magnates}}).

During his reign, King Sigismund granted several royal castles and the royal domains attached to them to the members of the barons' leagues; by 1407, the number of royal castles decreased from 111 to 66.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 322}}</ref> The king, however, wanted to strengthen his position and for this purpose, in 1408, he founded the [[Order of the Dragon]], a chivalric order whose 22 members (''e.g.'', the Palatine [[Garai|Nicholas II Garai]], count [[Hermann II of Celje]] and the ''Despot'' [[Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107>]]) swore fidelity to the king, his queen and their future children.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 309}}</ref><ref name='M<U+00E1>lyusz'>{{cite book | pages = 59<U+2013>90}}</ref>

Some signs of the increasing self-consciousness of the "magnates" appeared in the 1420s.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> Some of them commenced to use names that referred to the high office their ancestors had held; ''e.g.'', the members of the Losonci family started to call themselves ''B<U+00E1>nfi'' meaning the "son of a [[Ban (title)|Ban]]" in reference to their forefather who had been the Ban of Dalmatia and Croatia.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 359}}</ref> Other magnates clearly referred to their descent from former "barons of the realm" in their deeds or used noble titles (such as "count" or "duke") abroad following the example of the western nobility although the public law of the kingdom did not accept their claim to distinctive titles.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 361}}</ref>

When King Sigismund's son-in-law, [[Albert II of Germany|Albert I]] (1437<U+2013>1439) was proclaimed king, he had to take a solemn oath that he would exercise his [[royal prerogative|prerogative powers]] only with the consent of the Royal Council.<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | page = 198}}</ref> Following King Albert's death, a civil war broke out between the followers of his posthumous son, King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous|Ladislaus V]] (1440<U+2013>1457) and the partisans of his opponent, King [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III of Poland|Vladislaus I]] (1440<U+2013>1444).<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | pages = 199<U+2013>202}}</ref> Between 1440 and 1458, the [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] was convoked in each year (with the exception of 1443 and 1449) and it was involved in the legislative process of law-making: the bills were passed by the Diet before receiving the [[Royal Assent]].<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | page = 195}}</ref> When the monarch (or the [[regent]]) convoked the Diet, he sent a personal invitation to the prelates, "barons of the realm" and "magnates" and they attended in person at the assembly, while other nobles were usually represented by their deputies.<ref name="History of Hungary II."/>  Consequently, the Diets were dominated by the "magnates" not only because of their personal presence, but also because of the tendency that the counties elected their partisans as their own delegates.<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | page = 196}}</ref>

In 1445, the Diet elected seven [[Captain General|Captains General]] ({{lang-hu|f<U+0151>kapit<U+00E1>ny}}, {{lang-la|generalis capitaneus}}) in order to govern the kingdom during the absence of King Vladislaus I (who actually had fallen in the [[Battle of Varna]]).<ref name='Chronology I'>{{cite book | last = Benda | first = K<U+00E1>lm<U+00E1>n (editor) | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Magyarorsz<U+00E1>g t<U+00F6>rt<U+00E9>neti kronol<U+00F3>gi<U+00E1>ja I /A kezdetekt<U+0151>l 1526-ig/ ''("The Chronology of the History of Hungary - From the beginnings until 1526")''| publisher = Akad<U+00E9>miai Kiad<U+00F3> | year = 1981 | location = Budapest | page = 264| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 963 05 2661 1}}</ref> In 1446, the assembly of the Estates proclaimed [[John Hunyadi]] to Regent and he was to govern the realm in cooperation with the Estates until 1453 when King Ladislaus V returned to the kingdom.<ref name='Chronology I'>{{cite book | pages = 266, 270}}</ref>

John Hunyadi was the first temporal "magnate" who received a hereditary title from a king of Hungary: in 1453, King Ladislaus V appointed him the hereditary head ({{lang-hu|<U+00F6>r<U+00F6>k<U+00F6>s f<U+0151>isp<U+00E1>n}}, {{lang-la|h<U+00E6>reditarius comes}}) of [[Beszterce-Nasz<U+00F3>d|Beszterce county]] (now ''Bistri<U+0163>a'' in Romania) and thus he became a count in the sense similar to the title's usage in the western countries.<ref name='Chronology I'>{{cite book | page = 270}}</ref> Although, some of the immigrant "magnates"<ref>''E.g.'', Prince Fyodor Koriatovych, the counts Hermann and Ulrich of Cille and the ''Despots'' Stefan Lazarevi<U+0107> and George Brankovi<U+0107>.</ref> had already used [[Title#Honorary titles granted by heads of state|honorary titles]] before and they were often mentioned even in official documents with a reference to their title,<ref>''E.g.'', Article 25 of the Act of 1439 and Article 9 of the Act of 1454.</ref> but their title was granted by foreign monarchs and the public law in the Kingdom of Hungary did not recognize any special privileges connected to it.

John Hunyadi's son, [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias I]] (1458<U+2013>1490) was proclaimed to king by the Estates, but he had to wage war against [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] who claimed the throne for himself.<ref name='Chronology I'>{{cite book | page = 276}}</ref> Several magnates supported the emperor's claim and proclaimed him to king against King Matthias; the emperor rewarded the brothers [[Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi|Sigismund and John of Szentgy<U+00F6>rgy and Bazin]] with the hereditary noble title "count of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]" in 1459 and thus they became entitled to use red [[sealing wax]].<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 381}}</ref><ref name="Chronology I"/> Although the Counts Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi commenced to use their title in their deeds, but in the Kingdom of Hungary, public law did not distinguish them from other nobles.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> 

King Matthias I also rewarded his partisans with hereditary titles and appointed them hereditary heads of counties: John Vitovec became the hereditary head of Zagorje county in 1463; Emeric Szapolyai received the honor of [[Szepes county]] in 1465; in 1467, Nicholas Csupor de Monoszl<U+00F3> and John Ernuszt were appointed to hereditary head of  [[Virovitica (former county)|Ver<U+0151>ce county]] and [[Tur<U+00F3>c (county)|Tur<U+00F3>c county]] respectively; in the 1480s, Nicholas B<U+00E1>nffy de Als<U+00F3>lendva and Peter and Matthias Ger<U+00E9>b received such hereditary titles.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | pages = 381<U+2013>382}}</ref><ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | page = 227}}</ref> The hereditary heads of counties were entitled, similarly to the "counts of the Holy Roman Empire", to use red sealing was.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | page = 382}}</ref> Moreover, during his reign, all the members of the wealthier families descending from the "barons of the realm" received the honorific ''magnificus'' which was a next step towards their separation from other nobles.<ref name='History of Hungary II.'>{{cite book | page = 226}}</ref>

In 1487, a new expression appeared in a deed of [[armistice]] signed by King Matthias: 18 families<ref>The families B<U+00E1>nfi de Als<U+00F3>lendva, B<U+00E1>thory, de Corbavia ''(Korb<U+00E1>viai)'', Ellerbach, Ernuszt, Garai, Frankopan ''(Frangep<U+00E1>n)'', H<U+00E9>derv<U+00E1>ry, Losonci, M<U+00F3>ric de Meggyesalja, Orsz<U+00E1>g de Gut, Paksi, Paumkirchner, Per<U+00E9>nyi, Rozgonyi, Szapolyai, Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi, <U+00DA>jlaki ''(F<U+00FC>gedi, Erik op. cit. p. 385)''.</ref> were referred to as "'''natural barons of Hungary'''" ({{lang-hu|Magyarorsz<U+00E1>g term<U+00E9>szetes b<U+00E1>r<U+00F3>i}}, {{lang-la|barones natureles in Hungaria}}) in contrast to the "barons of the realm" who were still the holders of the highest offices in the public administration and the Royal Households.<ref name="Encyclopedia"/> One of the 19 families (the [[<U+00DA>jlaki family]]) was styled "duke" in the deed, while other four families were styled "count" - the latter group included the Szentgy<U+00F6>rgyi family which suggests that King Matthias accepted the title his opponent had granted to them.<ref name='Counts'>{{cite book | pages = 383<U+2013>385}}</ref>
