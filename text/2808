'''"Come, all ye jolly tinner boys"''' is a traditional [[Folk music|folk song]] associated with [[Cornwall]] that was written about [[1807]], when [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] made threats that would affect trade in Cornwall at the time of the [[Battle of Eylau|invasion of Poland]]. The song contains the line ''Why forty thousand Cornish boys shall knawa the reason why.'' <ref>[http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/CORNISH/2001-07/0995657519 RootsWeb: CORNISH-L [CON&#93; Trelawney<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

According to Cornish historian [[Robert Morton Nance]], it was possibly the inspiration for [[Robert Stephen Hawker|R. S. Hawker's]] "[[The Song of the Western Men<U+200E>]]" which was written in 1824 and contains a strikingly similar line: ''Here's twenty thousand Cornish men will know the reason why!''

''To stop our tin and copper mines, and all our pilchard traade.''

''Chorus- Hurea for tin and copper, boys, and fisheries likewise!<br>
''Hurea for ''Cornish maadens-Oh, bless their pretty eyes!''<br>
''Hurea for our ould gentrie, and may they never faale!''<br>
''Hurea, hurea for Cornwall! Hurea, boys, "one and ale!"''

''He summonsed forty thousand men, to Polland they did goa,'' <br>
''And for to rob and plunder there you very well do knawa;'' <br>
''But ten-thou-sand were killed, and laade dead in blood and goare,'' <br>
''And thirty thousand ranned away, and I cante tell where, I'm sure.''

''And should that Boney Peartie have forty thousand still'' <br>
