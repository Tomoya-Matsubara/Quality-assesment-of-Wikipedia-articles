Weber is most famous for the thesis in [[economic sociology]] which he elaborated in his book ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. In this text, Weber argued that [[ascetic]] [[Protestantism]] was one of the major "elective affinities" associated with the rise of [[capitalism]], [[bureaucracy]] and the [[rational-legal]] [[nation-state]] in the [[Western world]].  Against Marx's "[[historical materialism]]," Weber emphasised the importance, for understanding the development of capitalism, of cultural influences embedded in religion.<ref>Weber, Max ''The Protestant Ethic and "The Spirit of Capitalism"'' (1905). Translated by Stephen Kalberg (2002), Roxbury Publishing Company, pp. 19, 35; Weber's references on these pages to "Superstructure" and "base" are unambiguous references to Marxism's base/superstructure theory.</ref> The ''Protestant Ethic'' formed the earliest work in Weber's broader project in the [[sociology of religion]]: he would go on to examine the [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|religions of China]], the [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism|religions of India]] and [[Ancient Judaism (book)|ancient Judaism]], with particular regard to the apparent non-development of capitalism in the corresponding societies and to their differing forms of [[social stratification]].

In another major work, ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'', Weber defined the [[State (polity)|state]] as an entity which successfully claims a "[[monopoly of force|monopoly on the legitimate use of violence]]", a definition that became pivotal to the study of modern Western [[political science]]. His analysis of [[bureaucracy]] in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' is still central to the modern study of organisations. Weber was the first to recognise several diverse aspects of social authority, which he respectively categorised according to their charismatic, traditional and legal forms. His analysis of bureaucracy emphasised that modern state institutions are based on a form of [[rational-legal authority]]. Weber's thought regarding the rationalising and [[Secularization|secularising]] tendencies of modern Western society (sometimes described as the "[[Rationalization (sociology)|Weber Thesis]]") led to the development of [[critical theory]], particularly in the work of later thinkers such as [[J<U+00FC>rgen Habermas]].

After the [[First World War]], Weber was among the founders of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]]. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919.  After contracting the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]], he died of [[pneumonia]] in 1920, at the age of 56.

==Biography==
=== Early life and family background ===
Weber was born in 1864, in [[Erfurt]], [[Thuringia]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu">{{cite web|author=Kim, Sung Ho|date=24 August 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/|title=Max Weber|publisher=Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 February 2010}}</ref> He was the eldest of the seven children of [[Max Weber Sr.]], a wealthy and prominent [[civil service|civil servant]] and member of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)]], and his wife Helene Fallenstein, who descended from French [[Huguenot]] immigrants and held strong moral absolutist ideas.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref>Periodical, Sociology Volume 250, September 1999, 'Max Weber'</ref> Weber Sr.'s involvement in public life immersed his home in both politics and academia, as his salon welcomed many prominent scholars and public figures.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> The young Weber and his brother [[Alfred Weber|Alfred]], who also became a sociologist and economist, thrived in this intellectual atmosphere.  Weber's 1876 Christmas presents to his parents, when he was thirteen years old, were two historical essays entitled "About the course of German history, with special reference to the positions of the Emperor and the Pope," and "About the Roman Imperial period from Constantine to the migration of nations."<ref>Sica, Alan (2004).

=== Early work ===
In the years between the completion of his dissertation and habilitation, Weber took an interest in contemporary [[social policy]].

He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

===Later work===
After Weber's immense productivity in the early 1890s, he did not publish any papers between early 1898 and late 1902, finally resigning his professorship in late 1903. Freed from those obligations, in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the ''[[Archiv f<U+00FC>r Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik|Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare]]'',<ref name="Bendix3">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=63sC9uaYqQsC&visbn=0520031946&pg=PA3&lpg=PA2&sig=ow6l2JcRLE_K1x4lws1fhNFlwWY |page=3 }}</ref> where he worked with his colleagues Edgar Jaff<U+00E9> and [[Werner Sombart]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="GRMW">Guenther Roth: "History and sociology in the work of Max Weber", in: British Journal of Sociology, 27(3), 1979</ref> His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences; his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars.<ref name="Calhoun2002-166"/> In 1904, Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal, notably his essay ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', which became his most famous work<ref name="EESoc-22">{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Richard Swedberg|title=Essays in economic sociology|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WaV7Q35jy_AC&pg=PA22|accessdate=22 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691009063|page=22}}</ref> and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems.<ref>Iannaccone, Laurence (1998).

Also in 1904, he visited the [[United States]] and participated in the Congress of Arts and Sciences held in connection with the [[World's Fair]] ([[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]) in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Despite his partial recovery, Weber felt that he was unable to resume regular teaching at that time and continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907.<ref name="Lachmann1970"/><ref name="Bendix3"/> In 1909, disappointed with the ''Verein'', he co-founded the [[German Sociological Association]] (''Deutsche Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Soziologie'', or DGS) and served as its first treasurer.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> He would, however, resign from the DSG in 1912.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.<ref name="TPaSToMW">[[Wolfgang J.

Weber joined the [[Workers' council|worker and soldier council]] of Heidelberg in 1918. Weber then served in the German delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the [[Weimar Constitution]].<ref name="Bendix3"/> Motivated by his understanding of the [[United States|American]] model, he advocated a strong, [[Suffrage|popularly elected]] presidency as a constitutional counter-balance to the power of the professional [[bureaucracy]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers which became [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] of the Weimar Constitution.  These provisions were later used by [[Adolf Hitler]] to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, thereby allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.<ref>Sven Eliaeson, "Constitutional Caesarism: Weber's Politics in their German Context," in Turner, Stephen (ed) (2000).

Many colleagues and students in Munich attacked his response to the [[German Revolution]] of 1918<U+2013>19 and some [[right-wing]] students held protests in front of his home.<ref name="TPaSToMW"/> Max Weber contracted the [[Spanish flu]] and died of [[pneumonia]] in Munich on 14 June 1920.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>  At the time of his death, Weber had not finished writing his ''magnum opus'' on sociological theory: ''[[Economy and Society]]''. His widow Marianne helped prepare it for its publication in 1921<U+2013>22.

==Weber's thought==
===Inspirations===
Weber's thinking was strongly influenced by [[German idealism]] and particularly by [[neo-Kantianism]], to which he had been exposed through [[Heinrich Rickert]], his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>  Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from the way in which the human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>  Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist [[Georg Simmel]].<ref>David Frisby, ''Georg Simmel (Key Sociologists)'', 2nd ed., (Routledge, London), 2002.  ISBN 0415285356.</ref>

Weber was also influenced by [[Kantian ethics]], which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties.  In this last respect, the influence of [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy]] is evident.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>  According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', the "deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber's ethical worldview."<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>  Though the influence of his mother's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber's life and work, and though he maintained a deep, life-long interest in the study of religions, Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious.<ref>H. H. Gerth and C. W. Mills, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y_pqZS5q72UC&pg=PA25 "A Biographical View,''] in ''From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology''.</ref><ref>Alan Mittleman, "[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1006/reli.1999.0176 Leo Strauss and Relativism: the Critique of Max Weber," ''Religion'', '''29''', pp. 15-27.</ref>

As a political economist and economic historian, Weber belonged to the "youngest" German [[historical school of economics]], represented by academics such as [[Gustav von Schmoller]] and his student [[Werner Sombart]].  But, even though Weber's research interests were very much in line with that school, his views on methodology and the [[Theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] diverged significantly from those of other German historicists and were closer, in fact, to those of [[Carl Menger]] and the [[Austrian School]], the traditional rivals of the historical school.<ref name="Swedberg-econ-soc"/><ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/> (See section on [[Max_Weber#Economics|Economics]].)

===Methodology===
Unlike some other classical figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any specific set of rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Compared to Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology.<ref name="Calhoun2002-165">{{cite book|author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical sociological theory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&pg=PA165|accessdate=19 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780631213482|page=165}}</ref> Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see [[structure and action]] discussion) and whereas Marx argued for the primacy of the material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.<ref name="Calhoun2002-165"/><ref name="AllanAllan2005-144">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

Weber was concerned with the question of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and [[subjectivity]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Weber distinguished [[social action]] from [[social behaviour]], noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-31">{{cite book|author=George Ritzer|title=Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots: The Basics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pX6pPwAACAAJ|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=29 September 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073404387|page=31}}</ref> Study of social action through [[Verstehen|interpretive means]] (''Verstehen'') must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that the individual attaches to their actions.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="Calhoun2002-166"/> Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientists is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist).<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Weber noted that the importance of subjectivity in social sciences makes creation of full-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in [[natural sciences]] and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal&nbsp;<U+2013> although one definitely worth striving for.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

The principle of "[[methodological individualism]]," which holds that social scientists should seek to understand collectivities (such as nations, cultures, governments, churches, corporations, etc.) solely as the result and the context of the actions of individual persons, can be traced to Weber, particularly to the first chapter of ''[[Economy and Society]]'', in which he argues that only individuals "can be treated as agents in a course of subjectively understandable action."<ref name="Ritzer2009-31"/><ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/> In other words, Weber argued that social phenomena can be understood scientifically only to the extent that they are captured by models of the behaviour of purposeful individuals, models which Weber called "[[ideal type]]s," from which actual historical events will necessarily deviate due to accidental and irrational factors.<ref name="StanfordIndividualism">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ "Methodological individualism,"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', accessed 30 Jan. 2010</ref> The analytical constructs of an ideal type never exist in reality, but provide objective benchmarks against which real-life constructs can be measured.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-149">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

Weber's methodology was developed in the context of a wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the ''[[Methodenstreit]]''.<ref name="Calhoun2002-166"/> Weber's position was close to [[historicism]], as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors).<ref name="Calhoun2002-166"/> Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of [[comparative history|comparative historical analysis]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-153">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

===Rationalisation===
Many scholars have described [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] and the question of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="Calhoun2002-167">{{cite book|author=Craig J.

By rationalisation, Weber understood first, the individual cost-benefit calculation, second, the wider, bureaucratic organisation of the organisations and finally, in the more general sense as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic ([[disenchantment]]).<ref name="AllanAllan2005-151"/>

Weber began his studies of the subject in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in [[ascetic]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Religious denomination|denominations]], particularly [[Calvinism]], shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain.<ref name="Bendix60">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&vq=Calvinism&sig=2VcBXYzS4AikEHxnscx0ArVRB_0 |pages=60<U+2013>61 }}</ref><ref name="AllanAllan2005-162"/> In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of [[calling (religious)|calling]]).<ref name="AllanAllan2005-162"/> The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.<ref name="Andrew J.

Weber continued his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on [[bureaucracy]] and on the classification of [[authority]] into three types&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Rational-legal authority|legitimate]], [[Traditional authority|traditional]] and [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]]&nbsp;<U+2013> of which the legitimate (or rational) is the dominant one in the modern world.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> In these works Weber described what he saw as society's movement towards rationalisation.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating [[capitalism]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart from the rest of the world.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

{{quote|What Weber depicted was not only the secularisation of Western ''culture'', but also and especially the development of modern ''societies'' from the viewpoint of rationalisation. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposive-rational economic and administrative action.

Features of rationalisation include increasing knowledge, growing impersonality and enhanced control of social and material life.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Weber was ambivalent towards rationalisation; while admitting it was responsible for many advances, in particular, freeing humans from traditional, restrictive and illogical social guidelines, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as "cogs in the machine" and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the bureaucratic [[iron cage]] of rationality and bureaucracy.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/><ref name="Calhoun2002-167"/><ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/><ref name="AllanAllan2005-177">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

In a [[dystopian]] critique of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern society is a product of an [[individualistic]] drive of the [[Reformation]], yet at the same time, the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism.<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/>

===Sociology of religion===
Weber's work in the field of [[sociology of religion]] started with the essay ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and continued with the analysis of ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]''. His work on other religions was interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following ''Ancient Judaism'' with studies of [[Psalm]]s, [[Book of Jacob]], Talmudic Jewry, early Christianity and Islam.<ref name="Bendix285">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&sig=VYtdrBYGinacJyetbio7RM3L0G0 |page=285 }}</ref> His three main themes in the essays were the effect of religious ideas on economic activities, the relation between [[social stratification]] and religious ideas and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation.<ref name="BendixChapter9">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&sig=VYtdrBYGinacJyetbio7RM3L0G0

Weber saw religion as one of the core forces in the society.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-153"/> His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the [[Occident]] and the [[Orient]], although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].<ref name="BendixChapter9"/> In the analysis of his findings, Weber maintained that [[Calvinist]] (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had had a major impact on the [[social innovation]] and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the [[rationalism]] of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise.<ref name="BendixChapter9"/> In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or what he referred to as "[[disenchantment]] of the world".<ref name="BendixChapter9"/>

Weber also proposed a [[socioevolutionary]] model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to [[polytheism]], then to [[pantheism]], [[monotheism]] and finally, [[ethical monotheism]].<ref name="AllanAllan2005-154">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

Weber's essay ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' is his most famous work.<ref name="EESoc-22"/> It is argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the [[economic system]].<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37">{{cite book|author=George Ritzer|title=Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots: The Basics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pX6pPwAACAAJ|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=29 September 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073404387|pages=35<U+2013>37}}</ref> In ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', Weber put forward the thesis that [[Calvinism|Calvinist ethic]] and ideas influenced the development of capitalism.<ref name="Ritzer2009-35-37"/> He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany.

Weber abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on the book ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''.

The phrase "[[Protestant work ethic|work ethic]]" used in modern commentary is a derivative of the "[[Protestant ethic]]" discussed by Weber.

====''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism''====
{{Main|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism}}
''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the [[orthodox]] doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society.<ref name="Bendix142">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&sig=qB7kMtwHdeX_SDZVw3dl3llByos

====''Ancient Judaism''====
{{Main|Ancient Judaism (book)}}
In ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'', his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors which resulted in the early differences between [[Oriental]] and [[Western culture|Occidental]] [[religiosity]].<ref name="Bendix200">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&sig=jY4jOrcK-AOz7Cd7jJT2bpVGP5E

Weber noted that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occident state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures.

Weber's premature death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Jacob]], [[Talmudic]] Jewry, early [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

===Politics and government===
In [[political sociology]], one of Weber's most significant contributions is his ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' essay. Therein, Weber unveils the definition of the [[State (polity)|state]] that has become so pivotal to Western social thought: that the state is that entity which possesses a delegatable [[monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force]].<ref name="E-PoV">{{cite book|author=Daniel Warner|title=An ethic of responsibility in international relations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jNc4mc_MYdIC&pg=PA9|accessdate=5 April 2011|year=1991|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=9781555872663|pages=9-10}}</ref> Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power.<ref name="E-PoV"/> A politician must not be a man of the "true [[Christian ethic]]", understood by Weber as being the ethic of the [[Sermon on the Mount]], that is to say, the injunction to turn the other cheek.<ref name="PaV">{{cite book|author=Randal Marlin|title=Propaganda and the ethics of persuasion|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA155|accessdate=5 April 2011|year=2002|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551113760|page=155}}</ref> An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood to be a [[saint]], for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it.<ref name="PaV"/> The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the ethic of ultimate ends and the ethic of responsibility and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).<ref name="PaV"/>

Weber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of political leadership (alternatively referred to as three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):
# [[charismatic domination]] ([[family|familial]] and [[religion and politics|religious]]),
# [[traditional domination]] ([[patriarch]]s, [[patriarchy|patrimonialism]], [[feudalism]]) and
# [[legal domination]] (modern law and state, [[bureaucracy]]).<ref name="WolfJM">{{cite book|author=Wolfgang J.

In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of [[tripartite classification of authority|this tripartite distinction]].<ref name="Bendix296">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber|url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA296&lpg=PA296&sig=rgKDAVzqxPnxpRJchkceEbMkp1g|page=296}}</ref> He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to "routinise" into a more structured form of authority.<ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/> In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a "traditional revolution". The move towards a [[rational-legal]] structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end.<ref name="Bendix303">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber|url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0415174538&id=C_j_2nOUIpcC&pg=PA303&lpg=PA303&sig=Q6Mr8eDZ9P0m68uGEcc3gUwGZjw|pages=303<U+2013>305}}</ref> Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory.

Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.<ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/><ref name="Bureaucratic"/> It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term.<ref name="BuSach">{{cite book|author1=Marshall Sashkin|author2=Molly G.

Weber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy:<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D. Allan|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory: Seeing the Social World|date=2 November 2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412059279|pages=172<U+2013>176}}</ref> The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a [[monetary economy]]&nbsp;<U+2013> these resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/> Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and [[transportation]] technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and [[democratisation]] and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/>

Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.<ref name="Bureaucratic"/><ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/>

{{quote|The decisive reason for the advance of the bureaucratic organisation has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organisation|Max Weber<ref name="Hooghe2001"/>}}

While recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned "[[iron cage]]" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.<ref name="Bureaucratic"/><ref name="GRitzer">[[George Ritzer]], ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption'', Pine Forge Press, 2004, ISBN 0-7619-8819-X, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN076198819X&id=DznT_TbfKzMC&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=rationalization+%22iron+cage%22+%22polar+night+of+icy+darkness%22&sig=T4GVWJHDLYKbPVBg7lXN5KJFSb4 Google Print, p.55]</ref> In order to counteract bureaucrats, the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians.<ref name="Bureaucratic"/>

====Social stratification====

Weber also formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]], with [[Social class]], [[Social status]] and [[Political party]] as conceptually distinct elements.<ref name="Bendix85">{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber
|url=http://books.google.com/books?visbn=0520031946&id=63sC9uaYqQsC&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&sig=m2qBtfP7dnRGf-y5JS1t-yvrJPo
|pages=85<U+2013>87}}</ref>
* [[Social class]] is based on economically determined relationship to the [[market]] (owner, [[renting|renter]], employee etc.).
* [[Status class]] is based on non-economical qualities like [[honour]], [[prestige]] and religion.
* [[Party class]] refers to affiliations in the political domain.
All three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called "[[life chances]]" (opportunities to improve one's life).<ref name="Bendix85"/>

===Economics===
Weber regarded himself primarily as a "political economist,"<ref name="ScienceVoc">M. Weber, "[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/moriyuki/abukuma/weber/lecture/science_frame.html Science as a Vocation]", lecture given in 1918 at Munich University</ref><ref name="WPet"/><ref name="PRBaehr"/> and all of his professorial appointments were in [[economics]], though today his contributions in that field are largely overshadowed by his role as a founder of modern [[sociology]].  As an economist, Weber belonged to the "youngest" German [[historical school of economics]].<ref name="capa">[http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/het/profiles/weber.htm Max Weber, 1864<U+2013>1920], New School for Social Research</ref>  The great differences between that school's interests and methods on the one hand and those of the [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical school]] (from which modern [[mainstream economics]] largely derives) on the other, explain why Weber's influence on economics today is hard to discern.<ref>[http://homepage.newschool.edu/~het/schools/historic.htm "The German Historical School"], New School for Social Research</ref>

Though his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting [[economic history]], Weber's defence of "[[methodological individualism]]" in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by [[Carl Menger]], the founder of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, in the context of the academic ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' ("debate over methods") of the late 19th century.<ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/> Unlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the [[Marginalism|marginal theory of value]] and taught it to his students.<ref name="Swedberg-econ-soc">Richard Swedberg, "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_4_58/ai_58496750/ Max Weber as an Economist and as a Sociologist: Towards a Fuller Understanding of Weber's View of Economics - Critical Essay]," ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', (1999).</ref><ref name="Schweitzer">Arthur Schweitzer, [http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/7/3/279 "Frank Knight's Social Economics,"] ''History of Political Economics'', '''7''', 279-292 (1975).</ref>

The phrase "methodological individualism," which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]], was coined by the Austrian-American economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber.<ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/>  According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive]] or [[Analytic philosophy|descriptive]], because ''understanding'' some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and ''interpret'' it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract "[[ideal type|ideal (pure) types]]".<ref name="capa"/> This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see ''[[Verstehen]]''), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the "[[rational economic man]]" (''[[homo economicus]]''), which is at the heart of modern [[mainstream economics]].<ref name="StanfordIndividualism"/><ref name="capa"/>

In terms of concrete research, Weber's best known work in economics concerned the relations between religion and [[capitalism]], which he explored in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' as well as in his other works on the [[sociology of religion]].<ref name="capa"/>  Other contributions include his early work on the [[Die R<U+00F6>mische Agrargeschichte in ihrer Bedeutung f<U+00FC>r das Staats- und Privatrecht|economic history of Roman agrarian society]] (1891) and on the [[Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany|labour relations in Eastern Germany]] (1892), his analysis of the [[Zur Geschichte der Handelsgesellschaften im Mittelalter|history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages]] (1889), his critique of [[Marxism]], the discussion of the roles of [[idealism]] and [[materialism]] in the history of capitalism in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922) and his ''[[Wirtschaftsgeschichte|General Economic History]]'' (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.<ref name="capa"/>

Though today read primarily by sociologists and [[Social philosophy|social philosophers]], Weber's work did have a significant influence on [[Frank Knight]], one of the founders of the neoclassical [[Chicago school of economics]], who translated Weber's ''General Economic History'' into English in 1927.<ref name="Emmett">{{cite book|author1=Ross B. Emmett|title=Frank Knight and the Chicago School in American Economics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=h0iLWOEln-EC&pg=PA111|accessdate=1 April 2011|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=97804157750070|pages=111<U+2013>123}}</ref>  Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism "from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense."<ref name="Schweitzer" />

====Economic calculation====
Weber, like his colleague [[Werner Sombart]], regarded [[Cost-benefit analysis|economic calculation]] and especially the [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]] method of business [[Accountancy|accounting]], as one of the most important forms of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] associated the development of modern capitalism.<ref name="SwedbergAgevall2005-22">{{cite book|author1=Richard Swedberg|author2=Ola Agevall|title=The Max Weber dictionary: key words and central concepts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_c3Mcnh8hCgC&pg=PA22|accessdate=22 March 2011|year=2005|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804750950|pages=22<U+2013>23}}</ref> Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of [[socialism]] as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs.<ref name="Tribe">{{cite book|author1=Keith Tribe|title=Strategies of Economic Order: German Economic Discourse, 1750<U+2013>1950|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Y3Z4V9A8LzoC&pg=PA140|accessdate=30 March 2011|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521619431|pages=140<U+2013>168}}</ref> In his introduction to his ''Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion'' (1920), Weber argues that

{{quote|In order to make possible a rational utilisation of the means of production, a system of in-kind accounting would have to determine "value"&nbsp;<U+2013> indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the "prices" used in book valuation in modern business accounting. But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular, verified; whether, for instance, they should vary from one production unit to the next (on the basis of economic location), or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy, on the basis of "social utility," that is, of (present and future) consumption requirements [...] Nothing is gained by assuming that, if only the problem of a non-monetary economy were seriously enough attacked, a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented. The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation. We cannot speak of a rational "planned economy" so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational "plan."|Max Weber<ref name="EconSoc-calculation" />}}

Weber presented sociology as the science of human [[social action]]; action which he separated into [[Traditional action|traditional]], [[Affectional action|affectional]], [[Value-rational action|value-rational]] and [[Instrumental action|instrumental]].<ref name="Ferrante">[[Joan Ferrante]], ''Sociology: A Global Perspective'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2005, ISBN 0-495-00561-4, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0495005614&id=Idjxdi1IlFAC&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Weber+Traditional+affectional+value+rational+instrumental&sig=Ib8EP0Ze_EPQgij7ns6lUSbNs2U Google Print, p.21]</ref><ref name="Ritzer2009-33">{{cite book|author=George Ritzer|title=Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots: The Basics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pX6pPwAACAAJ|accessdate=22 March 2011|date=29 September 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073404387|page=33}}</ref>

{{quote|[Sociology is] the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' to be thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history and any kind of ''a priori'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.|Max Weber ,''The Nature of Social Action'', 1922|<ref>Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G. 'Weber: Selections in Translation' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 7.</ref>}}

In his time, however, Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist.<ref name="WPet"/><ref name="PRBaehr">Peter R. Baehr, ''Founders Classics Canons'', Transaction Publishers, 2002, ISBN 0-7658-0129-9, [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0765801299&id=iRrnCPe66PYC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=weber+founder+of+sociology&sig=2j-I_jptUjtqaKbiCjJpQgt0ohM Google Print, p.22]</ref> The breadth of Weber's topical interests is apparent in the depth of his [[social theory]]:

{{quote|The affinity between capitalism and Protestantism, the religious origins of the Western world, the force of charisma in religion as well as in politics, the all-embracing process of rationalisation and the bureaucratic price of progress, the role of legitimacy and of violence as the offspring of leadership, the 'disenchantment' of the modern world together with the never-ending power of religion, the antagonistic relation between intellectualism and eroticism: all these are key concepts which attest to the enduring fascination of Weber's thinking.|[[Joachim Radkau]], ''Max Weber: A Biography'', 2005<ref>Radkau, Joachim ''Max Weber: A Biography''. 1995. Polity Press. (''Inside sleeve'')</ref>}}

Many of Weber's works famous today were collected, revised and published [[posthumous work|posthumously]]. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as [[Talcott Parsons]] and [[C. Wright Mills]]. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, [[teleological]] perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism.<ref>Fish, Jonathan S. 2005. 'Defending the Durkheimian Tradition. Religion, Emotion and Morality' Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing.</ref>

Weber has influenced many later thinkers, such as [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Gy<U+00F6>rgy Luk<U+00E1>cs]] and [[J<U+00FC>rgen Habermas]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> Different elements of his thought were acclaimed by [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Hans Morgenthau]] and [[Raymond Aron]].<ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/> According to Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who had met Weber during his time at the University of Vienna,

{{quote|The early death of this genius was a great disaster for Germany. Had Weber lived longer, the German people of today would be able to look to this example of an "[[Aryan]]" who would not be broken by [[Nazism|National Socialism]].|[[Ludwig von Mises]], 2009<ref>Ludwig von Mises, ''[http://mises.org/books/memoirs_mises.pdf Memoirs]'', (Mises Institute, Auburn, AL, 2009), p. 88.</ref>}}

According to his friend, the psychiatrist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], Weber was "the greatest German of our era" and his untimely death felt to him "as if the German world had lost its heart."<ref>Quoted in Peter Baehr, "[http://books.google.com/books?id=uN__U6VdHEgC&pg=PA410 The Grammar of Prudence: Arendt, Jaspers and the Appraisal of Max Weber]," in ''Hannah Arendt in Jerusalem'', edited by Steven E. Aschheim (University of California Press, 2001), p. 410.</ref>

==Critical responses to Weber==
Weber's explanations are highly specific to the historical periods he analysed.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-150-151">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D. Allan|title=Explorations in Classical Sociological Theory: Seeing the Social World|date=2 November 2005|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412059279|pages=150<U+2013>151}}</ref> This makes it more difficult to generalise from his analysis and modify his theories for other circumstances.<ref name="AllanAllan2005-150-151"/>

Further, many scholars have disagreed with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] argued that capitalism did not begin with the [[Industrial Revolution]] but in 14th century Italy.<ref>Schumpeter, Joseph: "History of Economic Analysis", Oxford University Press, 1954</ref> In [[Milan]], [[Venice]] and [[Florence]] the small [[Italian city-states|city-state]] governments led to the development of the earliest forms of [[capitalism]].<ref>Rothbard, Muarry N.: "Economic Thought Before Adam Smith", Ludwig von Mises Press, 1995, p. 142</ref> In the 16th century [[Antwerp]] was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland.<ref>Evans, Eric J.: "The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783<U+2013>1870", Longman, 1983, p. 114, ISBN 0-5824-8969-5.</ref> Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that [[Calvinism]] hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the [[labour theory of value]].<ref>Kauder, Emil: "The Retarded Acceptance of the Marginal Utility Theory", Quarterly Journal of Economics 67(4), 1953</ref>

==Notes==
'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Weber wrote his books in German. Original titles printed after his death (1920) are most likely [[Anthology|compilations]] of his unfinished works (of the 'Collected Essays...' form). Many [[translation]]s are made of parts or sections of various German [[original]]s and the names of the translations often do not reveal what part of German work they contain. Weber's work is generally quoted according to the critical ''[[Gesamtausgabe]]'' (collected works edition), which is published by Mohr Siebeck in [[T<U+00FC>bingen]]. For an extensive list of Max Weber's works see [[list of Max Weber works]].
