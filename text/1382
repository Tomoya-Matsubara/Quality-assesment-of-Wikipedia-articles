'''Pulteney Bridge''' is a [[bridge]] that crosses the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England. It was designed by [[Robert Adam]] in a [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style to connect the city with the new town of [[Bathwick]]. It is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides. It was designated as an [[Ancient monument]] and is now a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref name="ioe"/>

The bridge was completed by 1774. Within 20 years alterations were made which expanded the shops and changed the fa<U+00E7>ades. By the end of the 18th century floods had damaged the bridge; however it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to the shops included [[cantilever]]ed extensions on both the north and south faces of the bridge. In the 20th century several schemes have been enacted to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, which has contributed to its prominence as a site for tourists.

The bridge is now {{convert|300|m}} long and {{convert|58|ft}} wide with shops on both sides. Although there have been plans to completely pedestrianise the bridge it is still used by buses and taxis. The much photographed bridge and the weir below it are close to the centre of the city which is a [[World Heritage Site]] largely because of its [[Georgian architecture]].

The bridge was designed by [[Robert Adam]], whose working drawings are preserved in the [[Sir John Soane's Museum]],<ref name="ioe">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=443316|title=Pulteney Bridge|work=Images of England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=27 September 2008}}</ref> and is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides.<ref name="manco">{{cite web|url=http://www.buildinghistory.org/bath/georgian/pulteney-bridge.shtml|title=Pulteney Bridge |work=Bath Past|publisher=Jean Manco|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=Pulteney Bridge|url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0011127|publisher=Structurae|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>

It is named after Frances Pulteney, the wife of [[Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet]]. Their rural [[Bathwick]] estate was separated from the city by the river which could only be crossed by a ferry. He made plans to create a new town, which would become a suburb to the historic city of Bath. First he needed a better river crossing than the existing ferry, hence the bridge.<ref name="manco"/> Their involvement is recalled by [[Great Pulteney Street]] in Bathwick, reputed to be the longest boulevard of its kind in Europe, while [[Henrietta Street, Bath|Henrietta Street]] was named after his daughter.

Initial plans by [[Thomas Paty]],<ref name=ehlebridge/> which did not include the shops, were rejected and adapted by the brothers [[Robert Adam|Robert]] and [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] who were working on designs for the new town at Bathwick.<ref name=archhist>{{cite journal|last=Manco|first=Jean|title=Pulteney Bridge|journal=Architectural History|year=1995|issue=38|pages=129-145|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1568625?uid=3738032&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21101759592161}}</ref> Robert Adam then became involved in further designs for the bridge. In his hands the simple construction envisaged by Pulteney became an elegant structure lined with shops. Adam had visited both [[Florence]] and [[Venice]], where he would have seen the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and the [[Rialto Bridge|Ponte di Rialto]]. But Adam's design more closely followed [[Andrea Palladio]]'s rejected design for the Rialto.<ref name="manco"/> Adam's working drawings are in the [[Sir John Soane's Museum]] in London.<ref name=transportheritage>{{cite web | url=http://transportheritage.com/find-heritage-locations.html?sobi2Task=sobi2Details&sobi2Id=304 | title=Pulteney Bridge, Bath|publisher=Transport Heritage|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> The revised bridge was {{convert|300|m}} long<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pocketbritain.com/PulteneyBridge.html|title=The only bridge in Britain to support shops|publisher=Pocket Britain|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> and {{convert|50|ft}} wide, rather than the {{convert|30|ft}} envisaged by Paty, which overcame the objections of the local council about the bridge being too narrow.<ref name=archhist/>

Construction started in 1769 and was completed by 1774 at a cost of <U+00A3>11,000.<ref name=ehlebridge/> The builders for the lower part of the bridge were local masons Reed and Lowther while the construction of the shops was carried out by Singers and Lankeshere.<ref name=archhist/>

==Development==

[[File:Pulteney Bridge, Bath, rear view.jpg|thumb|left|Pulteney Bridge, view from the north side]]
Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created. In 1792 alterations to enlarge the shops, combining the original 16 shops into six large ones, and widening it to {{convert|58|ft}}, which marred the elegance of the fa<U+00E7>ades.<ref name=archhist/> Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. [[Thomas Telford]] suggested replacing the bridge with a single span [[cast iron]] bridge. However it was rebuilt by [[John Pinch the elder|John Pinch]] senior, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam's design.<ref name=ehlebridge/> 19th-century shopkeepers altered windows, or [[Cantilever|cantilevered]] out over the river as the fancy took them. Some even painted advertisements on the outside of their shops affecting the view from the river and Grand Parade.<ref name=archhist/> The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match.<ref name=archhist/>

In 1936 the bridge became scheduled as a national monument. The city council bought several of the shops and made plans for the restoration of the original fa<U+00E7>ade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulteney Bridge|url=http://www.genegillminiatures.com/photos/pulteney.html|publisher=Gene Gill Miniatures|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> The restoration was completed in time for the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951.<ref name=transportheritage/> Further work was carried out in the 1960s because the underside [[soffit]]s of all three arches needed repair.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Pulteney Bridge|url=http://www.wapboat.co.uk/bathboating/hist.htm|publisher=Pulteney Cruisers Ltd|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref> More restoration was needed in 1975.<ref name="manco"/> The scheduling of the bridge as an ancient monument in 1936 has since been replaced with its designation as a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://idox.bathnes.gov.uk/WAM/doc/Report-545712.pdf?extension=.pdf&id=545712&location=VOLUME2&contentType=application/pdf&pageCount=1 |format=PDF| title=Details of location and proposal: Caf<U+00E9> Au Lait Ltd, 7 Pulteney Bridge, City Centre, Bath, BA2 4AX |publisher=Bath and North east Somerset Council|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2009 [[Bath and North East Somerset]] council put forward plans to ban vehicles from the bridge and turn it into a pedestrianised zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/media/press%20releases/2009/transportstreets/Pages/Suggestion%20on%20Pulteney%20Bridge%20pedestrianisation.aspx|title= Suggestion on Pulteney Bridge pedestrianisation|date=11 November 2009|publisher=Bath and North East Somerset Council|accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>

==Architecture==
[[File:Malton-pulteney-bridge-in-1779.jpg|thumb|Pulteney Bridge in 1779 by [[Thomas Malton]]]]
Three high segmental arches of equal span support the bridge. The western mid-stream pier was rebuilt in 1804.<ref name=ehlebridge>{{cite web|title=Pulteney Bridge|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1394514|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>

The shops on the north side of the bridge are numbered 1 to 8 and on the south side 9 to 17. The two story [[limestone]] buildings are in a [[Palladian architecture|palladian]] style with [[Slate industry in Wales|Welsh slate]] roofs. There were built around 1774 and altered around 1895, when the western pavilion was moved for the construction of the Grand Parade. Further restoration was undertaken in 1975. Number 5, the centrepiece on the south side, has a large [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Venetian window]]. The shops on the north side have cantilevered rear extensions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shops Nos 9 to 17|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1394516|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Shops Nos 1 to 8|url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1394515|work=National Heritage List for England|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=3 March 2013}}</ref>

The appearance of the bridge changed when the wier was constructed in 1979.<ref name=ehlebridge/>
