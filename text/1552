'''Sustainable Archaeology''' (SA) is an inter-institutional collaborative research initiative and [[digital data]] cooperative between the [[University of Western Ontario]] (Western) and [[McMaster University]] that advances a sustainable form of practice and research for [[archaeology]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Sustainable Archaeology research facilities are located in [[London, Ontario]], and [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Sustainable Archaeology is funded by the [[Canadian Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) and the [[Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation]] Ontario Research Fund (ORF). 

Sustainable Archaeology consolidates [[archaeological]] collections from across Ontario digitally into the [[#Informational Platform|Informational Platform]], a web-based [[database]] and research interface, bringing together thousands of collections generated through research and commercial or [[cultural resource management]] (CRM) archaeology in Ontario. Collections are held in-trust by Sustainable Archaeology for the people of Ontario.<ref name="SustainableArchaeology">''Sustainable Archaeology Collections Procedures and Standards''. Document on file at Sustainable Archaeology. 2011.</ref> The consolidation of data and collections facilitates collaborative research between divergent fields of archaeological study, and access to both recent and previously excavated archaeological materials. [[Artifacts]], field records, contextual datasets, and reporting are converted into digital information and [[3D]] images and integrated into the Informational Platform of databases. 

== Background ==
Since the 1970s, provincial legislation in Ontario has mandated that lands projected for development must first be assessed for evidence of [[cultural heritage]], including [[archaeological sites]].<ref> [[Ministry of Tourism and Culture (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport]]. [http://www.mtc.gov.on.ca/en/archaeology/archaeology_planning.shtml "Land Use Planning and Development"] Accessed 31 October 2012</ref>. As a result, the number of archaeological sites identified and excavated in the province, and the amount of data and collections amassed, has grown steadily over the past several decades.<ref>Ferris, Neal and Aubrey Cannon, [http://www.academia.edu/1660165/Capacities_for_a_Sustainable_Archaeology "Capacities for a Sustainable Archaeology"],Paper presented at the [[Ontario Archaeological Society]] Annual Meeting, Waterloo, Ontario, 17 October 2009. Accessed 30 October 2012.</ref> Today, 80-90% of archaeological practice in Ontario is conducted as commercial-based fieldwork, undertaken on behalf of the public and private sector by [[cultural resource management]] (CRM) companies.<ref>Sustainable Archaeology. http://sustainablearchaeology.org/. Accessed 30 October 2012</ref> The collection of archaeological artifacts from licensed excavations has exceeded storage capabilities in Ontario. Collections have remained largely inaccessible to researchers, students, and local and Descendant communities.<ref name="academia"> Ferris and Cannon, [http://www.academia.edu/1660165/Capacities_for_a_Sustainable_Archaeology "Capacities for a Sustainable Archaeology"]</ref> This "crisis" in curation reflects broader trends in the management of archaeological collections internationally.<ref>Sullivan, Lynnne P. and S.

=== Project Development ===
In 2009 Dr. Neal Ferris of the University of Western Ontario was awarded a $9.8 million dollar grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation.<ref>Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation.[http://www.mri.gov.on.ca/english/news/ORF120709_bd1.asp "Funding Announcement: Projects Funded in London"], 7 December 2009. Accessed 30 October 2012.</ref> <ref>Canadian Foundation for Innovation. [http://www.innovation.ca/en/Media/News/GovernmentCanadaInvestsinResearchInfrastructure "Government of Canada Invests in Research Infastructure"], 18 June 2009. Accessed 30 October 2012</ref> The grant was awarded for the collaborative initiative between University of Western Ontario under Dr. Ferris as the Principal Investigator, and McMaster University, under Principle Investigator Dr. Aubrey Cannon to establish a research and digital data cooperative and physical repository for collections. Construction of the Western facility in London, Ontario began in the fall of 2010. The London facility is located off-campus, adjacent to the [[Museum of Ontario Archaeology]]. The McMaster facility was constructed off-campus in a renovated space at [[McMaster Innovation Park]] in Hamilton, Ontario. 

Construction at the Western facility was completed in the fall of 2011. Renovations at the McMaster facility at McMaster Innovation Park were completed in 2012.   

== Mission Statement ==
Sustainable Archaeology operates under the following mission statement:

"Sustainable Archaeology is dedicated to advancing a transformative practice of archaeology that integrates the many forms of the discipline <U+2013> commercial, academic, avocational <U+2013> by consolidating the extensively recovered archaeological record from Ontario and converting that material and contextual data into broadly accessible digital information, to allow for ongoing and innovative research that engages with this compiled and rich archaeological heritage left by the countless previous generations of those who loved, lived, and died in this place, and by all those today who draw connections, meaning, value, and identity from the human heritage of this place."<ref name="SustainableArchaeology" />

== Informational Platform ==
The Sustainable Archaeology Informational Platform is a web-based research oriented database system that incorporates a range of diverse data sets, including direct access to raw artifact data. The database serves as means of [[digital curation]] for site reports, maps and [[archaeological plan|site plans]], [[geographic information system|geospatial data]], photographs, and other datasets generated by archaeological studies and excavations in Ontario, and linked to collections held physically at the two facilities.<ref name="academia" /> The Informational Platform incorporates value added studies completed at the Sustainable Archaeology facilities, including macro and microscopic analyses and digital imaging.<ref name="academia" /> The Informational Platform is informed by both archaeological and descendant community cultural values.<ref>Westby, Kira.
