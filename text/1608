'''Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor''' is a [[non-profit]] founded in 1999 to develop an aviation museum in [[Hawaii]].<ref name="japair">{{cite news|title=RARE JAPANESE AIRCRAFT RETURNS TO PEARL HARBOR.|publisher=US Fed News Service, Including US State News|year=2006|via=HighBeam Research|accessdate=March 2, 2014|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1178149591.html|subscription=yes}}</ref>  Part of Senator [[Daniel Inouye]]'s vision for a rebirth of [[Ford Island]], the museum hosts a variety of aviation exhibits with a majority relating directly to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and [[World War II]].  The first section of the museum, hangar 37, opened with the museum on December 7, 2006 and features much of the museum's static exhibits.  The museum's hangars will show damage from the attacks on Pearl Harbor from December 7, 1941.

The museum has been involved in community events ranging from preservation of historical landmarks to educational tours throughout Hawai'i. The focus devoted efforts to restoring the Ford Island control tower and signed a lease with the Navy to begin repairs. Visitors to the museum gain access via [[Roberts Hawaii|tour bus]] from the [[USS Arizona Memorial|Pearl Harbor Historic Sites]] on Halawa landing or use a US Military ID card at the [[Admiral Clarey bridge]] gate. The museum has received awards for their efforts to restore historical buildings and is listed as a top 10 aviation museum on TripAdvisor.

In June 2013, the museum fought the US Navy's plan to install 60,000 [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic panels]] over 28 acres on the Ford Island runway.<ref name="wilcol2013">{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/s?action=login&f=y&id=211343851&id=211343851|title=Navy halts move for solar project on historic runway|date=Jun 13, 2013|publisher=Star Advertiser|author=William Cole|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>  The Navy had intended to comply with Congressional and Defense Department mandates to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and offset the cost of Hawaiian energy costs, which are the highest in the United States.<ref name="wilcol2013" />  The plan deviated from a 2009 proposal which would use the panels to define the historic runway in favor of panels which would produce twice the power.<ref name="mcctri2012">{{cite news|title=Buffeted by opposition, Navy blinks on solar site|publisher=McClatchy-Tribute Regional News|author=William Cole|date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>  The Navy offered the museum $250,000 toward renovation of the control tower's elevator in exchange for their support of the plan which the museum declined.<ref name="mcctri2012" />  It organized an internet campaign to oppose the plan based on historical significance.<ref name="wilcol2013" />  Instead, the Navy decided to install the panels on existing structures around Pearl Harbor.<ref name="wilcol2013" />

===Community involvement===
In 2008, the museum received a grant from [[BAE Systems]] to fund its ''Barnstorming'' program to build wind tunnels and plane props that will tour local schools to teach aerospace education to sixth graders.<ref name="jenbla">{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2013/05/pacific-aviation-museum-seeks-sponsors.html|title=Pacific Aviation Museum seeks sponsors to help kids program fly on Neighbor Islands|author=Jenna Blakely|publisher=Pacific Business News|date=May 3, 2013|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>  In 2012, the program was credited with teaching 3,500 students from 40 schools.<ref name="jenbla" />

In 2013, the U.S. State Department awarded the museum the "Museums Connect" grant for the "''Past to Present: U.S. -Sino Bridge of Connections''" program.<ref name="hsta">{{cite news|url=http://www.hsta.org/index.php/news/pacific-aviation-museum-faciliates-cultural-exchange-and-leanring-project-f|title=Pacific Aviation Museum bridges cultural exchange project for Kaiser students|publisher=Hawaii State Teachers Association|date=January 7, 2013|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref>  The program allowed students from [[Henry J.

===Tourism===
During the [[Budget sequestration in 2013|2013 federal budget sequestration]] in the United States, the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor received an increase in tourists, due to limited ferry trips to the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]] which are operated by active duty [[United States Navy]] personnel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/morning_call/2013/04/battleship-missouri-other-pearl.html?page=all|title=Battleship Missouri, other Pearl Harbor sites benefit from sequestration|author=Stephanie Silverstein|publisher=Pacific Business News|date=April 26, 2013|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}</ref>  Because Ford Island is still part of the active military base [[Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam]], tourists gain access via the [[National Park Service]]'s Halawa Landing, now known as the Pearl Harbor Historic Sites, for tickets to the museum and then are transported via tour bus onto the installation for the museum and the USS ''Missouri''.<ref>{{cite web|title=NAVY TRANSFERS HALAWA LANDING TO NATIONAL PARK SERVICE|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1185453351.html|via=Highbeam|subscription=yes|date=April 7, 2006|publisher=US Fed News Service|accessdate=May 5, 2014}}</ref>
