The '''1876 FA Cup Final'''  was a [[Association football|football]] match between [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]] on 11 March 1876 at [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] in London.  It was the fifth final of the world's oldest football competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (known in the modern era as the [[FA Cup]]).  Wanderers had won the Cup on two previous occasions.  The Etonians were playing in their second consecutive final, having lost in the [[1875 FA Cup Final|1875 final]].  Both teams had conceded only one goal in the four rounds prior to the final.  In the semi-finals Wanderers defeated [[Swifts F.C.|Swifts]] and the Etonians beat the [[1874 FA Cup Final|1874]] FA Cup winners [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]].

The match finished in a 1&ndash;1 draw, the second time an FA Cup Final had finished all-square. [[John Hawley Edwards]] scored for Wanderers, but the Etonians equalised with a goal credited in modern publications to [[Alexander Bonsor]], although contemporary newspaper reports do not identify him as the scorer.  A week later, the replay took place at the same venue.  The Etonians were forced to make a number of changes due to players being unavailable, and the revised team was no match for the Wanderers, who won 3&ndash;0.  [[Charles Wollaston]] and [[Thomas Hughes (footballer)|Thomas Hughes]] scored a goal apiece in a five minute spell before half-time, and Hughes added the third early in the second half.

At the quarter-final stage, Wanderers took on the world's oldest football club, [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield]] and won 2&ndash;0, and the Etonians gained a 1&ndash;0 victory over [[Clapham Rovers F.C.|Clapham Rovers]].<ref name="Wand" /><ref name="OE" />  Both semi-final matches took place at [[The Oval|Kennington Oval]] in London, as stipulated in the original rules of the competition.  The Etonians beat the [[1874 FA Cup Final|1874]] FA Cup winners [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] 1&ndash;0 in the first semi-final, and a week later Wanderers clinched their place in the final, defeating the [[Slough]]-based club [[Swifts F.C.|Swifts]] 2&ndash;1.<ref name="Wand" /><ref name="OE" />

==Match==
===Summary===
[[File:Alfred Lyttelton, Vanity Fair, 1884-09-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Etonian player [[Alfred Lyttelton]] also played [[first-class cricket]], as depicted in this caricature published in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 1884]]
Three sets of brothers played in the match.  [[Francis Heron|Francis]] and [[Hubert Heron]] lined up for the Wanderers, while the Etonians' team included Hon. [[Edward Lyttelton]] and his brother Hon. [[Alfred Lyttelton]] and [[Albert Childers Thompson|Albert Meysey-Thompson]] and his brother [[Charles Meysey-Thompson|Charles]].  The latter pair's surname had been simply Thompson until it was changed in 1874, and for the final Albert played under the name Thompson and Charles under the name Meysey.<ref name="W45">Warsop, p.45</ref> This is the only occasion that two or more pairs of brothers have played in the same FA Cup Final.<ref>{{cite book | title= The Complete Record of the FA Cup|last= Collett|first= Mike |year= 2003|publisher= Sports Books|isbn=1-8998-0719-5|pages=792<U+2013>793}}</ref> Later that year, [[Francis Birley]] married Margaret, sister of his team-mate [[Jarvis Kenrick]].<ref>Warsop, p.64</ref>  The Etonian team also included [[Julian Sturgis]], who had been born in the USA and was the first foreign-born player to appear in the Cup Final (discounting those born to British parents in the [[British Empire]]),<ref>Warsop, p.128</ref> as well as the Hon. [[Arthur Kinnaird, 11th Lord Kinnaird|Arthur Kinnaird]], who had captained Wanderers to victory in the [[1873 FA Cup Final]].<ref>Warsop, p.93</ref>  Wanderers began the match with two [[full-back (football)|full-back]]s, two [[centre-back|half-back]]s and six [[forward (association football)|forward]]s, while the Etonians opted for one full-back, two half-backs and seven forwards.<ref name="W45" />

Wanderers won the coin toss and chose to start the game defending the Harleyford Road end of The Oval.  The crowd was estimated at 3,500, the largest for an FA Cup Final up to that point.<ref>Warsop, pp.40&ndash;45</ref>  The match was played in a strong wind, to the extent that when [[Frederick Maddison (footballer)|Frederick Maddison]] took a [[corner kick]] for Wanderers, the gale blew the ball back out of play.<ref name="W45" />  The Wanderers dominated the early stages of the game, but the Etonians kept them at bay for around 35 minutes until [[Charles Wollaston]] eluded Thompson and passed the ball to [[John Hawley Edwards]], who kicked it narrowly under the crossbar of the Etonians' goal to give Wanderers the lead.<ref name="W33">Warsop, p.33</ref>  In the second half the Old Etonians had the wind in their favour and had the better of the play.  Around five minutes after the interval, a corner kick to the Etonians led to a "scrimmage" (a term in common use at the time to describe a group of players struggling to gain possession of the ball) in front of their opponents' goal, which resulted in the ball and a number of players being forced over the goal-line, uprooting the goalposts in the process.  Modern sources credit the goal to [[Alexander Bonsor]],<ref name="SB">{{cite book|title=Nationwide Football Annual 2009&ndash;2010|editor=Barnes, Stuart|date=2009|page=132|publisher=SportsBooks|isbn=1-8998-0781-9}}</ref> but contemporary newspaper reports in ''[[The Sporting Life]]'' and ''[[Bell's Life in London]]'' do not mention his name, merely noting that the goal was scored "from a scrimmage".<ref name="W33" />  Neither team could manage to score another goal, and the game finished with the scores level, meaning that for the second successive season a replay would be needed to determine the winners of the competition.<ref name="SB" />

===Summary===
The replay took place one week later at the same venue.  The Wanderers fielded an unchanged team, but the Etonians had to make a number of changes, as Meysey was injured and three other players were unavailable due to other commitments.  One of the replacements, [[Edgar Lubbock]], had not long recovered from a bout of illness and was noted as being out of practice, and Kinnaird was still suffering the after-effects of an injury sustained in the original match.<ref name="W46" />

The weather on the day of the match was extremely cold, with the threat of snow.  The Etonians began the match playing in a rough manner,<ref name="W46" /> and there were also many appeals from the players for handball, which disrupted play.  After around half an hour, the Wanderers' forwards surged towards their opponents' goal and [[Charles Wollaston]] got the final kick which sent the ball past goalkeeper [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Quintin Hogg]], one of the replacement players brought in for the replay.<ref name="W34">Warsop, p.34</ref>  Almost immediately afterwards, another massed attack by the Wanderers led to [[Thomas Hughes (footballer)|Thomas Hughes]] doubling the lead.<ref name="W34" />  

Soon after half-time, Hawley Edwards, [[Francis Heron]] and [[Jarvis Kenrick]] combined in a skillful attack and set up Hughes to score his second goal of the game.<ref name="W34" />  Although the Wanderers' goalkeeper, [[W. D. O. Greig]], was called into action several times, the Etonians were unable to get the ball past him, and the match finished 3&ndash;0 to the Wanderers.<ref name="W46" />  The winning team's captain [[Francis Birley]] was praised for his performance by the press, as were both Lyttleton brothers for the Etonians.<ref name="W46" />
