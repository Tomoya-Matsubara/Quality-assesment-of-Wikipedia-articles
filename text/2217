The '''Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference''' ('''CCAC''') consists of 14 members as an affiliated conference of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]]. In many sports, they are structured as part of the Region VII of the NAIA while in some sports the conference champion qualifies directly for national competition.

The CCAC sanctions play in four men's sports which are [[soccer]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[basketball]] (Division I and Division II), and [[baseball]]. There are five sanctioned women's sports which are [[soccer]], [[volleyball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[basketball]] (Division I and Division II), and [[softball]].

In all sports, it sanctions regular season league play as well as a post-season tournament. It is the only conference in the NAIA nationally to be affiliated in both divisions of men's and women's basketball.
