'''Martin Raymond Keown''' (born 24 July 1966) is an [[England|English]] former professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] from 1984 to 2005 notably in the [[Premier League]] for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] where he made over 300 appearances for the club and won nine major trophies. 

He previously played for [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Keown made his England debut in 1992 against [[France national football team|France]] and went on to win 43 caps for the national side over the next 10 years, gradually forming a respected defensive partnership with Arsenal team-mate [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] at both club and international level. Keown represented England at four major international football finals including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] World Cups.

He is now a part-time scout and coach for Arsenal, as well as a pundit for the [[BBC]], [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]], [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], and [[Al Jazeera Sports +3]]. He came out of retirement in 2012 and briefly played for [[Combined Counties League|Combined Counties League Premier Division]] side [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]] in their [[FA Cup]] fixtures.

==Club career==

===Arsenal===
A [[Centre-half|centre back]] from [[Oxford]], Keown played for local sides and his local [[Gaelic football]] team as a boy, before joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a schoolboy contract in 1980, though he made his professional debut on loan at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in 1984. His debut for Arsenal came on 23 November 1985, when [[Don Howe]] was still their manager, and they drew 0<U+2013>0 with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[The Hawthorns]]. He played 22 league games that season  but when [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was appointed manager on 14 May 1986, he  decided that Keown was not part of his plans to try and turn Arsenal into league title contenders and on 9 June 1986 he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for <U+00A3>200,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41357|title=Martin Keown profile - Arsenal FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

===Aston Villa===
Keown signed for Villa after a season in which they had narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division, a mere four years after being [[European Cup]] winners and five years since being league champions. Manager [[Graham Turner]] was under a lot of pressure, and after  their dismal form continued into the [[1986<U+2013>87 in English football|1986<U+2013>87]] season he was sacked on 14 September 1986 and succeeded by [[Billy McNeill]]. Keown appeared in 36 league games that season, but he was unable to save Villa from finishing bottom of the First Division and being relegated after 12 successive seasons in the top flight. 

[[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] then arrived at [[Villa Park (stadium)|Villa Park]] to succeed the sacked McNeill, and Keown was very much part of his rebuilding plans as he missed just two league games and scored three goals as Villa finished second in the Second Division and won promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt. Keown helped the team secure its top flight status the following season, but was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 7 August 1989, just before the start of the [[1989<U+2013>90 in English football|1989<U+2013>90 season]], for a fee of <U+00A3>750,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41358|title=Martin Keown profile - Aston Villa FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

===Everton===
Keown had a fine start to his Everton career, and they topped the table for a while in late autumn and there was hope that they could win the league title, but their form ebbed away after Christmas and they managed only a sixth-place finish. Keown managed 20 league appearances that campaign and a slightly better 24 in [[1990<U+2013>91 in English football|1990<U+2013>91]], when Harvey was replaced by [[Howard Kendall]] as manager in November. He missed just three league games in [[1991<U+2013>92 in English football|1991<U+2013>92]], which brought another mid-table finish, and he played just 13 more league games for the Toffees before accepting a <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million return to Arsenal in February 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41359|title=Martin Keown profile - Everton FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

===Arsenal===
Keown did not feature in Arsenal's historic [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double of 1993 due to being [[cup-tied]]. However, he did manage 16 Premier League appearances, mostly at the expense of [[Steve Bould]], forming arguably the most intense battle for central defensive positions in the Premier League at the time. He and [[Andy Linighan]] were high quality defenders competing alongside Bould and captain [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] in the centre of one of the best English league defences of the 1990s.

Keown also missed out on Arsenal's [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] Final win over [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] the following year<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1994| url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/news/kind=8192/newsid=3436.html|accessdate=7 January 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080526180303/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/news/kind=8192/newsid=3436.html|archivedate=26 May 2008}}</ref> (although he did play a part in the overall campaign after appearing in earlier rounds<ref>{{cite web|title=Arsenal Appearances 1993/94|url=http://www.arseweb.com/history/stats/94.html|accessdate=7 January 2009}}</ref>) however, he did start the final the following season when Arsenal were narrowly beaten by [[Real Zaragoza]] after extra time.

He rarely missed a game in his first four full seasons back at Highbury, though in the [[1997<U+2013>98 in English football|1997<U+2013>98]] [[Double (association football)|double winning]] campaign, the 31-year-old Keown was selected just 18 times in the Premier League by manager [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]] as he claimed the first two major trophies of his career after well over a decade of waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41361|title=Martin Keown - Arsenal FC - Football-Heroes.net|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

Keown later became an integral part of [[Ars<U+00E8>ne Wenger]]'s double [[Double (association football)|Double]] winning sides of 1998 and 2002, remaining a first team regular until the end of the [[2002<U+2013>03 in English football|2002<U+2013>03 season]], when the Gunners won their ninth [[FA Cup]] but blew the chance of a unique fourth double due to a late loss of form in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41362|title=Martin Keown - Arsenal FC - Football-Heroes.net|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>

On 20 September 2003, during Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s match at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester United were awarded a late penalty, with the score at 0<U+2013>0. [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] stepped up to take the penalty, and hit the bar with it. After the penalty, Keown and [[Ray Parlour]] confronted van Nistelrooy, and Keown hit him on the back of the head. Keown remained at Arsenal until 2004, winning another [[Premier League]] title, before being released on a free transfer. His final season brought 10 league appearances <U+2013> the minimum to qualify for a title winner's medal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Games played by Martin Keown in 2003/2004|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=4149&season_id=133|publisher=Soccerbase|accessdate=17 November 2013}}</ref>

===Later career===
He signed for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but left after less than six months and signed for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in January 2005 until the end of the season, after which he retired.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keown begins coaching education|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4222404.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref>

===Wembley F.C.===
On June 2012, he was one of several former professional footballers who agreed to join [[Wembley F.C.]]  to play in their FA Cup campaign for the new season. Keown and fellow former-internationals [[Ray Parlour]], [[Danny Dichio]], [[Jaime Moreno]], [[Graeme Le Saux]], [[Claudio Caniggia]] and [[Brian McBride]], plus [[David Seaman]] (goalkeeping coach) and former England manager [[Terry Venables]] (technical advisor), all came out of retirement to play for Wembley F.C. as the club endeavours to play at [[Wembley Stadium]] <U+2013> all of which is to be featured in a television documentary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terry Venables' Wembley FC recruit former stars for FA Cup|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18534739|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=21 June 2012}}</ref> Wembley were knocked out in a replay by [[Uxbridge F.C.|Uxbridge]] after initially setting up the tie by knocking [[Langford F.C.|Langford]] out in the previous round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2012/Aug/wembley-uxbridge-report-300812.aspx |title=The website for the English football association, The FA Cup and The England football team - The FA Cup |publisher=The FA |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>

==International career==
Keown played U16 and U18 for England. When it was learned that both his parents were Irish, [[Jack Charlton]] made an inquiry as to his availability to play for the Republic of Ireland but Keown was not eligible due to his underage games. {{Clarify|date=February 2013}} He made his [[England national football team|England]] debut in 1992 against [[France national football team|France]]. With an injury to [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]] he was called up into England's squad for [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]], and played in all three of  England's matches.

Keown's early ascension to the England team under [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] did not continue under [[Terry Venables]], who ignored him completely. Keown earned a recall from [[Glenn Hoddle]] in 1997, and went to the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], but did not play. Keown became a regular under [[Kevin Keegan]] (captaining the side against [[Finland national football team|Finland]]) and played in two of England's [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] matches. 

By the time [[Sven-G<U+00F6>ran Eriksson]] became manager, Keown's age was starting to count against him, though he went to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], again as a non-playing squad member. Keown retired from international football the day after England's exit at the hands of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Keown calls time|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/newsid_2059000/2059066.stm|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=22 June 2002|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref> In all he played 43 times for England, scoring two goals.

==Management and career outside football==
Keown joined the coaching staff of [[A.F.C. Newbury|Newbury]] in August 2005, but is now coaching back at former club Arsenal where he is taking his coaching badges. He has been identified by former Arsenal manager [[Terry Neill]] as a key figure behind the success of Arsenal's inexperienced "new-look" defence (which the team resorted to after ongoing injury problems in the 2005<U+2013>06 season, notably setting a record for minutes played without conceding in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal's New Guard| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4771963.stm|accessdate=31 May 2006|work=BBC News|date=16 May 2006|first=Nathan|last=Mercer}}</ref> In 2007<U+2013>08 Keown was also a coach for the [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University Blues Football team]] on a part-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blues lose out in tough season opener|url=http://www.ouafc.com/news/136|accessdate=6 November 2008}}</ref>

Keown regularly appears as a pundit on the [[BBC]]'s football coverage and [[Match of the Day]], as well as covering the Champions League for Irish broadcaster [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]]. He was also working for [[ESPN UK]] during the [[Emirates Cup#2011|2011 Emirates Cup]].
