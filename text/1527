==History==
The Sherwood Valley Rancheria is a community of Coastal [[Pomo]] Indians, who are indigenous to Sonoma and Mendocino Counties in northern California. Their historical community was called Kul<U+00E1> Kai Pomo, and they traditionally lived along the upper course of the [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]]. They spoke the [[Pomoan languages|Pomo language]]. The last traditional chief of the Kul<U+00E1> Kai Pomo was Lunkaya.<ref>Anderson, Verle.

Russians were the first non-Indians with whom the Pomo had sustained contact. They withdrew, only to be replaced by increasing numbers of European-Americans, who came to Pomo country to farm or to mine gold in the mid-19th century. Non-Indians quickly outnumbers the Indians and wreaked havoc on their communities. A system of rancherias, or small reservations, was established by the US government for displaced Californian tribes, including the Sherwood Valley Rancheria.

==Today==
Sherwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians has over 450 enrolled members with 179 of them living on the reservation.<ref name="sdsu"/> The tribe owns Sherwood Valley Rancheria Casino and Creekside Cafe, formerly known as the Black Bart Casino, in Willits on land purchased by the tribe in 1987.<ref>[http://www.blackbartcasino.com/ ''Sherwood Valley Rancheria Casino.''] (retrieved 11 June 2010)</ref>
