SR&nbsp;100, part of the [[Lewis and Clark Trail Highway (Washington)|Lewis and Clark Trail Highway]], serves as a [[loop route]] and has a [[Washington State Route 100 Spur|spur route]] that serves the state park and a [[Coast Guard Station Cape Disappointment|Coast Guard station]]. SR&nbsp;100 was established in 1991 on the existing North Head Road, which was a paved county road by the late 1950s. The highway was washed away during a 1994 winter storm and had its spur route shortened in 2006.

Every year, the [[Washington State Department of Transportation]] (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of [[average annual daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR&nbsp;100 was its terminus at US&nbsp;101 in Illwaco, serving 2,100 vehicles, while the least busiest section was the intersection with its spur route in Cape Disappointment State Park, serving 650 vehicles.<ref name="ATR">{{cite web |author=Staff |year=2011 |title=2011 Annual Traffic Report |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/pdf/Annual_Traffic_Report_2011.pdf |format=PDF |page=125 |accessdate=March 5, 2013}}</ref>
