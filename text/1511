== Early life ==
Alcala was born Rodrigo Jacques Alcala Buquor in [[San Antonio, Texas]] to Raoul Alcala Buquor and Anna Maria Gutierrez.<ref name="files.usgwarchives.net"/> His father abandoned the family; his mother moved Rodney and his sisters to suburban [[Los Angeles]] when he was about 12.<ref>Montaldo, Charles: Profile of Serial Killer Rodney Alcala.

He joined the [[United States Army]] in 1960, at age 17, where he served as a clerk. In 1964, after what was described as a "[[nervous breakdown]]", he was diagnosed with [[antisocial personality disorder]]<ref>[http://voices.yahoo.com/rodney-alcala-dating-game-killer-6152746.html Yahoo]</ref> by a military psychiatrist and discharged on medical grounds.<ref name="laweekly"/> (other diagnoses later proposed by various psychiatric experts at his trials included [[narcissistic personality disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder]].<ref>Psychiatrist testifies Alcala may have untreatable mental disorder (March 4, 2010).

== Education ==
Alcala, who claims to have a "[[genius]]-level" [[IQ]], graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] School of Fine Arts after his medical discharge from the Army, and later attended [[New York University]] using the alias "John Berger", where he studied film under [[Roman Polanski]].<ref name="people"/>

== Early criminal history ==
Alcala committed his first known crime in 1968: A motorist in Los Angeles witnessed him luring an eight-year-old girl named Tali Shapiro<ref name = "CBS">48 Hours Mystery (September 25, 2010): "The Killing Game." [http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6900592n&tag=contentMain;contentAux CBSNews.com] Retrieved 2010-09-26.</ref> into his Hollywood apartment and called police.

During the summer months he also obtained a counseling job at a [[New Hampshire]] arts camp for children, using a slightly different alias, "John Burger."<ref name="people"/>  

In June 1971, Cornelia Michel Crilley, a 23-year-old [[Trans World Airlines]] flight attendant, was found raped and strangled in her [[Manhattan]] apartment.  Her murder would remain unsolved for the next 40 years.<ref>Secret, Mosi (February 4, 2011). 40 Years On, Detective Sees Light Shed on a Killing.

Later that summer, two children at the New Hampshire arts camp noticed Alcala's [[FBI]] wanted poster at the post office and notified camp directors. He was arrested and extradited back to California. By then, however, Tali Shapiro's parents had relocated her and her family to Mexico and refused to allow her to testify at Alcala's trial.<ref name = "CBS"/>  Unable to convict him of rape and attempted murder without their primary witness, prosecutors were forced to permit Alcala to plead guilty to a lesser charge of assault.<ref name="frere">Frere, Eileen (March 2, 2010).

In 1977, after his second release from prison, Alcala's [[Los Angeles]] parole officer permitted him to travel to [[New York City]].  [[NYPD]] [[Cold case (criminology)|cold-case]] investigators now believe that one week after arriving in Manhattan, Alcala killed Ellen Jane Hover, 23, daughter of the owner of [[Ciro<U+2019>s]], a popular Hollywood nightclub, and goddaughter of [[Dean Martin]] and [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]<ref>SERIAL KILLER RODNEY ALCALA IMPLICATED IN NEW YORK COLD CASE MURDERS (January 27, 2011).[http://www.insideedition.com/news/5687/serial-killer-rodney-alcala-implicated-in-new-york-cold-case-murders.aspx ''Inside Edition'' archive] Retrieved September 2, 2011</ref>  Her remains were found buried on the grounds of the [[Kykuit|Rockefeller Estate]] in [[Westchester County]].<ref name="secret"/>

In 1978 Alcala worked for a short time at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as a typesetter, and was interviewed by members of the [[Hillside Strangler]] task force as part of their investigation of known sex offenders. Although Alcala was ruled out as the Hillside Strangler, he was arrested and served a brief sentence for marijuana possession.<ref>{{cite web|author=Comments (44) By Christine Pelisek Thursday, Jan 21 2010 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2010-01-21/news/rodney-alcala-the-fine-art-of-killing/4 |title=Rodney Alcala: The Fine Art of Killing - Page 4 - News - Los Angeles |publisher=LA Weekly |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref> 

During this period Alcala also convinced hundreds of young men and women that he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his "portfolio."  A ''Times'' co-worker later recalled that Alcala shared his photos with workmates.  "I thought it was weird, but I was young, I didn<U+2019>t know anything," she said. "When I asked why he took the photos, he said their moms asked him to. I remember the girls were naked.<U+201D><ref>Pelisek, C (February 10, 2010): Rodney Alcala's Final Revenge.

==Samsoe murder and first two trials==
Robin Samsoe, a 12-year-old girl from [[Huntington Beach]], California disappeared somewhere between the beach and her [[ballet]] class on June 20, 1979. Her decomposing body was found 12 days later in the foothills of [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="abc">Serial Killer Alcala Convicted on All Counts (February 25, 2010) [http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/orange_county&id=7297812 abclocal.com] Retrieved 2010-07-26.</ref>  Police subsequently found her earrings in a Seattle locker rented by Alcala.<ref name="people"/>

In 1980 Alcala was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death for Samsoe's murder, but his conviction was overturned by the [[California Supreme Court]] because jurors had been improperly informed of his prior sex crimes.<ref name = "CBS"/>  In 1986, after a second trial virtually identical to the first except for omission of the prior criminal record testimony, he was convicted once again, and again sentenced to death. However, a [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] panel overthrew the second conviction, in part because a witness was not allowed to support Alcala's contention that the park ranger who found Samsoe's body had been "hypnotized by police investigators."<ref name="laweekly"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Mail Foreign Service |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1256827/Serial-killer-Rodney-Alcala-sentenced-death-California.html |title=Serial killer Rodney Alcala sentenced to death in California &#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2010-03-11|accessdate=2010-03-19 | location=London}}</ref>

==Additional victims discovered==
While preparing their third prosecution in 2003, Orange County investigators learned that Alcala's [[DNA]], sampled under a new state law (over his objections), matched [[semen]] left at the rape-murder scenes of two women in Los Angeles. Another pair of earrings found in Alcala's storage locker matched the DNA of one of the two victims.<ref name = "CBS"/>  Additional evidence, including another cold-case DNA match in 2004, led to Alcala's indictment for the murders of four additional women: Jill Barcomb, 18, a New York runaway found "rolled up like a ball" in a Los Angeles ravine in 1977,<ref name="Pelisek">Pelisek, C.

==Third (joined) trial==
In 2003, prosecutors entered a motion to join the Samsoe charges with those of the four newly discovered victims. Alcala's attorneys contested it; as one of them explained, "If you<U+2019>re a juror and you hear one murder case, you may be able to have reasonable doubt. But it<U+2019>s very hard to say you have reasonable doubt on all five, especially when four of the five aren<U+2019>t alleged by eyewitnesses but are proven by DNA matches."<ref name="Noe"/>  In 2006, the California Supreme Court ruled in the prosecution's favor,<ref name = "CBS"/> and in February 2010 Alcala stood trial on the five joined charges. 

For the third trial Alcala elected to act as his own attorney.  He took the stand in his own defense, and for five hours played the roles of both interrogator and witness, asking himself questions (addressing himself as "Mr. Alcala" in a deeper-than-normal voice), and then answering them.<ref name="Noe">Noe, Denise (November 22, 2010).

After less than two days' deliberation the jury convicted Alcala on all five counts of first-degree murder. A surprise witness during the penalty phase of the trial was Tali Shapiro, Alcala's first known victim.<ref name = "CBS"/><ref name="frere"/>  In March 2010, he was sentenced to death for a third time.

== ''Dating Game'' appearance ==
In 1978 Alcala, despite his status as a convicted rapist and registered sex offender, was accepted as a contestant on ''The Dating Game''.  By then he had already killed at least two women in California and probably two others in New York.<ref name="post"/>  Host [[Jim Lange]] introduced him as "...a successful photographer who got his start when his father found him in the darkroom at the age of 13, fully developed. Between takes you might find him [[skydiving]] or motorcycling."  

Actor Jed Mills, who competed against Alcala as "Bachelor #2", later described him as a "very strange guy" with "bizarre opinions".<ref name="CNN"/>  He added that Alcala did not wear earrings on the show, as he claimed during his 2010 trial; earrings were not yet a socially acceptable accoutrement for men in 1978.  "I had never seen a man with an earring in his ear," he said.  "I would have noticed them on him."<ref name="Pelisek"/>  The third contestant, Armand Chiami, has not made any public comments.

Alcala won a date with "bachelorette" Cheryl Bradshaw, who subsequently refused to go out with him, according to published reports, because she found him "creepy".<ref name="people"/><ref name="CNN"/>  [[Offender profiling|Criminal profiler]] [[Pat Brown (criminal profiler)|Pat Brown]], noting that Alcala killed Robin Samsoe and at least two other women after his ''Dating Game'' appearance, speculated that Bradshaw's rejection might have been an exacerbating factor. "One wonders what that did in his mind," Brown said. "That is something he would not take too well. [Serial killers] don't understand the rejection. They think that something is wrong with that girl: 'She played me. She played hard to get.'"<ref name="CNN"/>

==Appeal status and potential additional charges==
[[File:SanQuentinSP.jpg|thumb|[[San Quentin State Prison]], where Alcala has been incarcerated since 1979]]
Alcala has been incarcerated since his 1979 arrest for Samsoe's murder. In the period between his second and third trial he wrote ''You, the Jury'', a self-published 1994 book in which he asserted his innocence in the Samsoe case and suggested a different suspect. He also filed two lawsuits against the California penal system for a slip-and-fall claim, and for failing to provide him a low-fat diet.<ref name="laweekly">Rodney Alcala: The Fine Art of Killing (January 21, 2010).
