'''Japanese settlement''' in what now constitutes modern-day [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (FSM){{#tag:ref|The Federated States of Micronesia only came into existence in 1979, and achieved independence in 1986. This article will cover the context of Japanese settlement in the states of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae, which constitutes the modern-day country of the Federated States of Micronesia. At least one source by Peattie refers to Yap and Chuuk in the central region of the [[Caroline Islands]], while Pohnpei and Kosrae were classified as the Eastern Carolines.<ref name="Peattie158">Peattie (1988), p. 158</ref>|group=fn}} dates back to the 19th century, when Japanese traders and explorers settled on the central and eastern Carolines. Large-scale Japanese immigration to the islands occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, when Japan encouraged immigration to the islands in the [[South Pacific Mandate]] to offset demographic and economic problems which the country faced.<ref>Myers (1987), p. 198</ref> 

The Japanese immigrant populace in the central and eastern Carolines comprised of [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawans]] as well as a few [[Koreans in Micronesia|Koreans]].<ref name="Chuuk1989"/> Ethnic relations between the Japanese settlers and civil officers with the Micronesians were initially coordial and intermarriage was encouraged between the Japanese and Micronesians, although relations soured as the Japanese administration imposed policies that were in favour of the Japanese populace, as well as conscripting Micronesians to menial labour to support Japan's war effort in the [[Second World War]]. After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in 1945, virtually all Japanese were repatriated back to [[Japan]]. People of mixed Japanese and Micronesian descent were allowed to remain behind. Many of them assumed leading roles in the political, public and business sectors after the [[Second World War]], and constitute a large minority within FSM itself.<ref name="Peattie317">Peattie (1988), p. 317</ref>

==History==
===Early contacts===

The first recorded contact between the Japanese and Pacific Islanders (believed to be Micronesians) was reflected in the ''Kokon Chomon Jyu'',{{#tag:ref|A Japanese historical chronicle.|group=fn}} when eight men arrived at Okinoshima (an ancient town in modern-day [[Izu Province]]) in July 1171. They were described to be tall, having dark-brown and tattooed skin, wearing ornaments as well as having coarse hair. The Japanese served them some millet and sake, and left the town after a hostile encounter when the men attempted to take the bows and spears.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 105</ref> Japanese contact was also suggested by some anthorpologists in the 19th century, and at least one, James McKinney Alexander suggested that Micronesians may have intermarried with Japanese fishermen who were strayed off course and stranded in the islands. In a 1895 study, Alexander noted similarities between the cultural traditions, vocabulary and the pre-Christian beliefs between [[Pohnpei|Pohnpeian]] and [[Kosrae|Kosraeans]].<ref name="Price136">Price (1936), p. 168</ref> Studies done by other Japanese anthropologists in the 19th and 20th centuries noted that at least 60 Japanese vessels drifted into the [[Pacific Ocean]] between the 17th and 19th centuries and could have made windfalls in the Pacific Islands.{{#tag:ref|One Japanese anthropologist, Yosihiko Sinoto, supports this possibility. In an interview around 2005, Yosihiko believed that castaway Japanese vessels could have made windfalls in the Pacific and the American continent in the course of Japan's 5,000-year history. In the 1971-72, archaeologist Jose Garanger discovered [[potsherds]] believed to be of [[Jomon]] origin on [[Efate]] island in Vanuatu.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 21</ref>|group=fn}}

A Japanese [[corvette]], ''Ryujo'' under the command of [[Enomoto Takeaki]] stopped by Pohnpei and Kosrae between 1882 and 1883. The entire tenth class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|Japanese naval academy]] was abroad the ship, and was noted as the first Japanese warship to stop by Micronesian waters.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 7</ref> The king of Kosrae accorded  the Japanese crew a warm welcome, personally claimed that the Kosraeans had some Japanese ancestry.<ref name="Price136"/> Some years later, a Japanese cattle farmer, Shinroku Mizutani from the [[Bonin Islands]] visited Pohnpei in 1887 and 1889. In both visits, Mizutani stayed for a few days in the islands before he was chased out by the Spanish.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 75</ref>

===Late Spanish and German colonial eras (1890-1914)===

In 1890, two Japanese businessmen, Ukichi Taguchi and Tsunenori Suzuki formed the ''Nanto Shokai'' (South Seas Trading Company)  with the aim of developing Japanese commerical interests in Micronesia. They bought a sailing ship, ''Tenyu Maru'' and sailed for [[Yap]] in June and befriended a shipwrecked [[Irish American]] missionary, Daniel O'Keefe, but set sail for Pohnpei after two days. They set up a small store peddling Japanese wares under strict conditions imposed by the Spanish, and returned to Japan in December because of a dwindling funds. The ship was later sold to the Ichiya company which established two trading stations at Chuuk and Pohnpei. More Japanese businessmen arrived in Chuuk in 1892 under the charge of Mizutani and established a store at Chuuk in 1892.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 76</ref> A few Japanese, notably [[Koben Mori]], began socialising with the Chuukese and led semi-nomadic lifestyles until 1896 before gaining the protection of Spanish guards. Mori lived with a few Japanese compatriots, and became the resident agent for ''Hiki Shokai'', another Japanese trading company that had set up that came to set up a shop at [[Moen (island)|Moen]].<ref name="Peattie29">Peattie (1988), p. 29-30</ref>

The Japanese businessmen that were based at Moen were repatriated from Micronesia in 1900, a year after Spain ceded its sovereignty to Germany. Only Mori and another Japanese business agent remained behind in Chuuk and Pohnpei respectively.<ref name="Hezel103">Hezel (2003), p. 103</ref> At the time of German annexation, serving as the resident agent for a German trading company at that time. Mori lived in isolation until 1907 when the German authorities allowed permitted Japanese trade in Chuuk, and another trading company&ndash;''Murayama Shokai'' established a trading post in Tol. Japanese settlers also started to come in small numbers to Chuuk to engage in farming or fishing activities.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 30-33</ref> The German colonial administration granted the Japanese settlers equal rights with other European settlers in German-mandated territories, by justifying them as citizens of an imperialist power. In official statistics, the Japanese were legally classified as "White".<ref>Rainbird (2004), p. 27</ref>

===Japanese colonial era (1914-1945)===
The [[First World War]] saw many nations leap to take Germany's overseas possessions for themselves, and Micronesia was no exception.  A Japanese warship sailed into [[Truk Lagoon]] in October 1914; it was greeted by Japanese settlers living in the nearby islands.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 33</ref> The navy set up its regional headquarters at Chuuk and stationed a garrison at Pohnpei until 1922, where the region's administrative capital [[Kolonia]] was established under the [[South Pacific Mandate]]. When a civilian government was established in March 1922, there were about 150 Japanese living in Pohnpei, which consisted of traders and government officials. Another seventy Japanese immigrated to Pohnpei until 1930, and a few individuals also settled in neighbouring Chuuk, Kosrae and Yap.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 176</ref> In Chuuk, another hundred Japanese businessmen settled at Toloas by the late 1920s to cater to governmental business intetests. A few elementary schools were also built to cater to the local Japanese and Chuukese populace.{{#tag:ref|Of particular note was Koben Mori's influence to Chuuk's affairs in the 1920s. He was hired as a civilian affairs adviser by the military in 1916, and had a copra plantation and business interests in Chuuk by the 1920s. Mori was respected by both Japanese and the Chuukese alike and was elected as a communal chief by the Chuukese in the late 1920s.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 195-6</ref>|group=fn}}<ref name="Crocombe 2007, p. 186">Crocombe (2007), p. 186</ref> 

The majority of the settlers who came before 1930 consisted of [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawa]]ns. A tuna canning factory was set up at Pohnpei in 1930, and Japanese settlers from the [[T<U+014D>hoku region]] and [[Hokkaido]] later came in greater numbers after that. Some of whom also became fishermen, while others organised farming communes. The civilian government persuaded twenty-four families to establish a farming commune at [[Palikir]] in 1931, but the settlers faced problems adapting to the tropical climate and bringing their vegetable produce to Kolonia for sale. The civilian government moved in to quickly improve the transport network and electrical supplies throughout Pohnpei. In addition, they also granted larger tracts of land to the settlers, and the settlers also went into rice cultivation. More settlers followed suit, and an anthropologist, Umesao Tadao reported that the farming settlement in Pohnpei was well-established by 1941.<ref name="Peattie 1988, p. 316">Peattie (1988), p. 316</ref>

The Japanese populace at the other islands grew at a slower rate&ndash;although less so for [[Chuuk]], and Japanese tend to prefer to settle in low-lying areas like [[Tomil]] and [[Tol (island)|Tol]]. Road and electrical infrastructure were built in new towns and hamlets that were founded or expanded by Japanese settlers.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 177, 180</ref> Many towns and hamlets had at least a thousand Japanese inhabitants by 1941. Some conscript and contract labourers from mainland Japan, [[Okinawa]] and [[Korea]] were hired to build naval facilities at Chuuk and Pohnpei also contributed to the  increasing immigrant population in the central and eastern Carolines.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 53</ref> Kolonia and [[Palikir]] had the largest Japanese populace after the [[Marianas]] and [[Palau]], and the Japanese outnumbered the natives by a thin margin in 1941.<ref>National Research Council (U.S.). Pacific Science Board (1950), p. 433</ref> Kosrae was populated by no more than a few hundred Japanese throughout the colonial era; a few Japanese policemen were stationed on the island to keep law and order. Japanese and Korean labourers also briefly stayed on the island to carry out phosphate mining operations and establish a cotton plantation, but were repatriated back after the planntation failed.<ref name="Hezel 2003, p. 177">Hezel (2003), p. 177</ref>

Intermarriage between Japanese men and Micronesian women were encouraged, especially in Pohnpei and Chuuk where there are large Japanese populations. The number of intermarriages between the Japanese and Micronesians were the highest among Okinawan fishermen in the 1930s, many of whom were single men.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 187</ref> A sizeable community of mixed Japanese-Micronesians by the 1930s, and children of legitimate unions were conscripted into the Japanese military forces. Micronesians and Japanese-Micronesians came under the suspicion of the [[Kempeitai]] for national sympathies with the Americans, many reportedly faced harrassment as a result.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 231</ref> The mandated Micronesian islands reverted to military administration in 1943, and the regional headquarters was relocated from Palau to Chuuk.<ref>Myers et al. (1987), p. 208</ref> As food supplies ran scarce during the later months of the [[Second World War]], the Japanese military began stealing breadfruit and food supplies from Micronesian farms. The Japanese military avoided Japanese and Japanese-Micronesian families, especially those that wielded political influence within the local community.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 210</ref> In Chuuk, land was also confiscated from Micronesians and Japanese-Micronesians to facilitate the construction of new military facilities.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 82-3</ref>

===Recent years (1945-present)===

The Japanese settlers in the central and eastern Carolines were repatriated after the Japanese surrender. The civilians were repatriated first, while the soldiers stayed on as [[Prisoners of war]] to carry out repair works to the islands' infrastructure until 1946.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 309</ref> Most people of mixed Japanese-Micronesian descent stayed behind and were brought up by their mothers, although a few chose to return to Japan with their fathers. The American military government permitted some thirty-three{{#tag:ref|This figure encompasses all Micronesian territories under the former [[South Pacific Mandate]].|group=fn}} Japanese and Korean settlers to remain behind with their families, but this was allowed only under exceptional circumstances.<ref name="Peattie 1988, p. 316"/><ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 211</ref> Within the first few years after the war, some former Japanese settlers formed philanthrophic organisations to promote public understanding and memory of Japan's colonial legacy in Micronesia. These organisations organised visitation trips for the former settlers to the Carolines, usually with the purpose of maintaining kinship ties with their Japanese-Micronesian descendants.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 315</ref>

Japanese-Micronesians assumed leading positions in the governmental and corporate sector, particularly in Chuuk where there is a substantial percentage of Micronesians with Japanese ancestry.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 316-7</ref> Micronesia began to engage with Japan in the business and cultural spheres from the 1970s,{{#tag:ref|During a student exchange programme between Japan and Micronesia in 1979, then-Crown Prince [[Akihito]] noted that there were a sizable minority of Micronesian students with Japanese surnames. The Crown Prince interviewed a Chuukese student among the group, who revealed that he attributed his Japanese ancestry to his paternal grandfather.<ref>{{ja icon}} [http://www.jaipas.or.jp/123/123_1.htm <U+5929><U+7687><U+965B><U+4E0B><U+3068><U+30DF><U+30AF><U+30ED><U+30CD><U+30B7><U+30A2>], Izumi Kobayashi, Japan Institute for Pacific Studies, retrieved October 4, 2009</ref>|group=fn}} and established formal diplomatic ties with Japan in 1988, two years after FSM became an independent country.  In turn, Japan is one of the key aid providers to Micronesia. Many mixed Japanese-Micronesians sought closer cultural and business ties with Japan,<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 112</ref> and politicians of Japanese-Micronesian descent&ndash;notably [[Manny Mori]]<ref>[http://www.fsmgov.org/press/pr111308.htm President Mori's Visit to Japan], Government of the Federated States of Micronesia, November 13, 2008</ref> have made publicised visits to their ancestral homelands as well as personal friendship ties with some former Japanese leaders.<ref>[http://bild-art.de/kpress/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=525 Mori Sensei returns to a grand Chuuk State welcome] FSM Information Services, 21 October 2008</ref>

==Demographics==

A 1998 census conducted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese foreign affairs ministry]] showed 141 Japanese nationals residing in the FSM,<ref name="MFAJapan">[http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/micronesia/index.html MOFA: Japanese-Micronesian Relations], Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan, retrieved September 28, 2009</ref> the majority whom of are expatriate businessmen.<ref>Pacific Magazine Corp (1985), p. 34</ref> Another 2007 census counted a 114 Japanese nationals in the FSM.<ref name="ODAJapan"/> The Spanish counted fifteen Japanese traders based in Chuuk in 1895, after American missionaries reported of Japanese involvement in smuggling weapons and liquor.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 79</ref> A 1899 census counted a total of 30 Japanese nationals, mainly businessmen living in the [[Caroline Islands]], with the majority being located on Pohnpei, Chuuk and Palau.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 81</ref> The German authorities chased out most of the businessmen in 1900, leaving only a few Japanese in the Micronesian islands. A few Japanese began settling in the islands in 1907 after the German authorities allowed the Japanese traders to establish their enterprises in Pohnpei and Chuuk. Early Japanese settlers consisted of single men, and official statistics showed a gender imbalance with five Japanese males to one female.<ref name="Peattie160">Peattie (1988), p. 160</ref> Many Japanese men took on Micronesian wives and raised mixed Japanese-Micronesian families.<ref name="Byron28"/> 

Japanese arrivals to Micronesia remained modest until the 1920s, following which the islands experienced a quick increase in the number of immigrants, especially in [[Pohnpei]]. Immigrants consisted largely of single men in the 1920s, the majority of whom were Okinawan fishermen.<ref name="Peattie158"/> The influx of Japanese immigrants to the central and eastern Carolines was not as intense as compared to the Marianas and [[Japanese settlement in Palau]] until the early 1930s, and  constituted a little more than 10 percent{{#tag:ref|Both Okinawans and Koreans are also classified as "Japanese" all official census pertaining to the South Pacific Mandate.<ref name="Peattie220">Peattie (1988), p. 220</ref>|group=fn}} of the total Japanese populace through Micronesia in 1939.<ref name="Peattie158"/> In urban areas, Japanese settlers outnumbered Micronesians around the late 1930s.<ref name="Peattie155">Peattie (1988), p. 155</ref> Many Japanese families migrated to the central and eastern Carolines in the 1930s, and by 1935 there were three Japanese males to two females in the islands.<ref name="Peattie160"/> More Japanese were brought to the Central and Eastern Carolines during the Second World War, and the Japanese populace outnumbered the native Micronesians in many islands immediately after the Japanese surrender in 1945.<ref name="Chuuk1989"/> The majority of Japanese who were brought to the central and eastern Caroline islands consisted of labourers as well as military personnel, and soon outnumbered both Japanese and Micronesian civilians alike.<ref>[http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/2068/2/02whole.pdf War graves, munition dumps and pleasure grounds: A post-colonial perspective of Chuuk Lagoon's submerged World War II sites] William Jeffrey, December 2007, James Cook University</ref>

The Japanese population were repatriated back to Japan after the war, but most people of mixed Japanese-Micronesian remained in the islands and constituted a substantial percentage in the islands' percentages. They became assimiliated with the Micronesians,<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 90</ref> and in all official census they are identified by their Micronesian heritage.<ref name="CIAfactbook">[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fm.html Federated States of Micronesia], CIA World Factbook, retrieved October 2, 2009</ref> In 2001, the director of Japan's Institute for Pacific Studies, Izumi Kobayashi estimated that at least 23% of FSM's population had Japanese ancestry.<ref name="Crocombe 2007, p. 186"/> An official estimate in 2006 puts the number a little below 20%.<ref>[http://www.mra.fm/pdfs/nr_los_FromFSMAmbassador.pdf Letter to Steven K.

==Religion==

Japanese settlers were generally followers of [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhism]]. In the central and eastern Carolines, religious activities were less widely publicised than in the Marianas or Palau. In towns with a sizeable Japanese populace, the civilian government would fund the construction of at least one public shrine in each town, and in smaller Japanese settlements, community leaders would direct the construction of a small shrine for communal purposes.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 226</ref> Two Buddhist temples were also constructed during the Japanese colonial era, one at Dublon in Pohnpei and another in Chuuk.<ref>United States. Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (1946), p. 44</ref> 

Christian missionary activities&ndash;particularly [[Protestant]]&ndash;were more commonly seen in the central and eastern Carolines than in the other mandated islands. Four [[Congregationalist]] missionaries were sent to the Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1920 and received partial funding from the government.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 84</ref> Although Christian missionary activities were intended to cater to the spiritual needs of Micronesians, a few Japanese settlers and government officials also patronised the missionaries. Missionary and church services were suppressed from the late-1930s, but the continued presence of Japanese Christians prompted the civilian government to permit private church services until the Japanese surrender.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 201</ref> After the Japanese settlers were repatriated, the Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples were either abandoned or demolished. People of mixed Japanese-Micronesian heritage adopted Christianity in favour of Shinto and Buddhism.<ref name="CIAfactbook"/><ref>Brigham Young University--Hawaii Campus (1981), p. 36</ref>

==Language==

Early Japanese settlers taught their children to speak in the Japanese language. Some also learnty to speak some Micronesian languages, especially for traders and settlers who took Micronesian wives.<ref name="Peattie29"/> Japanese replaced the Micronesian languages as the [[lingua franca]] for day-to-day communication and administrative purposes, and both Japanese and Micronesians.<ref>[http://ir.library.osaka-u.ac.jp/metadb/up/LIBKIYOK01/KJ00004305114.pdf The formation of Micronesian Japanese: Teaching Japanese at Public Schools in Nan'yogunto], Kikuko Yui, Osaka University Knowledge Archive, retrieved October 2, 2009</ref> Day-to-day use of Japanese was discouraged when Micronesia came under [[United Nation]] trusteeship, and people of mixed Japanese-Micronesian heritage switched to using English and various Micronesian languages in their daily lives.<ref>[http://pacificweb.org/PDF/FSM/sexageprofile.pdf Historical Census Data (p. 5-6/13)] FSM Statistical Activities, Pacificweb.org (retrieved October 10, 2009)</ref> Japan's economic influence in Micronesia has prompted cultural organisations to promote the learning of Japanese language among FSM citizens.<ref>[http://www.micronesia.emb-japan.go.jp/articles/080902_e.html Establishment of FSM-Japan Friendship Society] Embassy of Japan in the Federated States of Micronesia, May 23, 2008</ref> Elementary Japanese had been offered as a foreign language in some schools, notably in the [[College of Micronesia-FSM]].<ref name="Crocombe402">Crocombe (2007), p. 402</ref>

==Economy==

A few Japanese trading companies established businesses at Chuuk and Pohnpei in the 1890s, and Koben Mori acted as its resident agent, helping to facilitate trade with the islanders. The early Japanese businessmen traded on alocholic products, explosives and Chinaware.<ref name="Hezel103"/> Contraband products like alcohol and weapons were also illegally traded illegally, and the Spanish administration made futile attempts to suppress these activities.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 80-1</ref> The Japanese traders were expelled from Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1900 when the Germans purchased the islands from [[Spain]], but Japanese traders returned to Chuuk in 1907 and set up a trading firm dealing with copra production.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 104</ref> After the Japanese annexed Micronesia from [[Germany]] in 1914, they gained a monopoly over the shipping routes in all of the mandated islands.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 120</ref> The rate of copra production reached twelve thousand tons per year by the 1920s, and had an export value of two million yen.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 181</ref> In the late 1920s, an Okinawan fisherman, Tamashiro established a [[tuna]] production factory at [[Wonei]]. The Japanese government provided incentives for fishermen to open new fishery production factories, and in 1937 there were at least 1500 Okinawans and Japanese who were employed in the fishery industry.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 186-7</ref> Japanese settlers introduced commercial agriculture in Pohnpei and to a smaller extent in Chuuk and Yap. A few Japanese businessmen also set up firms to oversee the plantatation of cash crops, including [[copra]], [[rice]] and pineapples. They constituted the main exports in the central and eastern Carolines.<ref>Oliver (1989), p. 241-2</ref>

After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the Allied occupation authorities scrapped all organisations pertaining to overseas trade, banking, finance and colonisation, and effectively led to an end on Japanese influence in Micronesia.<ref name="Peattie317"/> Trade restrictions were then enforced between Japan and Micronesia in the first two decades after the war, but were gradually removed in stages between 1973 and 1983.<ref>[http://www.fsmcongress.fm/15th%20CFSM%20News/CFSM%20News%2031-08.htm Japan former Prime Minister Mori addresses FSM Congress], Mori Sensei addresses 15th CFSM, Day-5: No. 31-08, October 9, 2008</ref> Japanese tourists began to visit the islands from the 1960s onwards, and private businesses were allowed to invest in hotel construction and fisheries.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 122</ref> Tourists from Japan could become one of the Federated States of Micronesia's principal economic driving forces, and the country would like to attract a greater share of the 30 million Japanese visiting foreign destinations annually.<ref>[http://www.spc.int/coastfish/news/Fish_News/95/NIAR_4.htm Pohnpei Fisheries Port Construction Underway], SPC Fisheries Newsletter 95, December 2000</ref> Sites of historical interests such as the sunken Japanese ships at Chuuk lagoon received the highest concentration of Japanese visitors.<ref>Crocombe (2007), p. 81</ref>

==Interethnic relations in society==

Racial segregation was practiced from the early days of civilian rule, and policies were enforced to restrict Micronesians in the education, work force, health care benefits and civil service to inferior positions as compared to their Japanese counterparts. The local populace was classified according to ethnicity, with the Japanese at the top of the social strata, followed by Okinawans, Koreans and the Micronesians at the bottom, although some scholars argued that the Micronesians were accorded a more privileged position than the Koreans, who often subjected to abuse by the Japanese authorities.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 192-3</ref> In the education sector, Micronesian children attended public schools (''logakko'' in Japanese) that emphasised on teaching vocational skills, self-discipline and a basic command of the Japanese language. Japanese, Okinawan and Korean children attended primary schools (''shogakko'') with lessons that were based on the mainstream Japanese curriculum.<ref name="Peattie220"/> Very few Micronesians progressed beyond the elementary level, and those who did usually had family connections with influential Japanese figures.<ref>Peattie (1988), p. 95-6</ref> Micronesians were generally accorded lower-ranking jobs, and most were employed as language interpreters, administrative assistants or jobs that required menial labour.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 193-4</ref>

The Japanese actively discouraged the practice of Micronesian customs and religions, which they had viewed it as "primitive" and "barbaric". Christian missionary activity among the Micronesians was encouraged by the civilian government during the [[Interwar period]], with the hope that they could facilitate Micronesians to adopt modern cultural practices.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 29-30</ref> Japanese cultural practices were actively encouraged; many Micronesians learnt to speak Japanese fluently and adopted Japanese manners and customs.<ref>Myers et al. (1987), p. 189</ref> On the other hand, many Koreans did not speak Japanese well, and eagerness of Okinawans to engage in manual labour occassionally motivated Micronesians to make critical remarks on the actual nature of the Japanese culture that Japanese administrators advocated to the Micronesians.<ref name="Peattie220"/> Japanese cultural influences were the strongest in Chuuk and Pohnpei, and in most towns by the 1920s, most Micronesians were dressed in Western or Japanese style-clothing.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 201</ref> Micronesians in these two states were also very receptive to promiscuous liaisons between Japanese men and Micronesian women; the first brothels appeared in both states in the 1910s. Separate brothels were established for Japanese and Micronesian men, although women in both types of brothels were mainly Micronesian women.<ref>Hiery (1995), p. 138</ref>

In Kosrae and Yap, the Japanese administration had to contend with  considerable resistance from the islanders to accept Japanese political and cultural influences. Anti-Japanese sentiment was developed from the early days of Japanese rule in Kosrae, when a Japanese sergeant who was placed in-charge of the island's administrative affairs often threatened the islanders with physical abuse when dealing with conflicts.<ref name="Hezel 2003, p. 177"/> Japanese customs were also frowned upon by Kosraeans as the practice of cremation for the dead and the administrators' indifference towards nudity clashed with the Christian moral values that the islanders held to.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 178</ref> Similarly in Yap, the islanders' negative attitudes towards the Japanese was developed as a result of incidences of cultural insensitivity from the Japanese administrators. In particular, the introduction of [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]] by the Japanese administration to work as policemen in the island incited racial  hatred of Yapese chiefs against the Japanese. As a consequence, few Japanese immigrants chose to settle in Yap or Kosrae.<ref>Hezel (2003), p. 179</ref>{{#tag:ref|In 1935, only 25 Japanese lived among 1,189 Kosraeans.<ref>Poyer et al. (2001), p. 23</ref>|group=fn}}
