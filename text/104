One of the few cobbled streets left within it, the streetcar tracks can still be seen.<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/hoboken/hoboken.html] Forgetten Hoboken w/ photo of Hudson Place tracks]</ref> At one time more than ten lines operated by the [[Public Service Railway]] originated/terminated<ref>List of Public Service Railway lines.
