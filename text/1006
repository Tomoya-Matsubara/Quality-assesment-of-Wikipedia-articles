==Description==
''Musa basjoo'' is a [[herbaceous]] [[perennial plant|perennial]] with trunk-like pseudostems growing to around {{convert|2|-|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a crown of mid-green leaves growing up to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide when mature. The species produces male and female flowers on the same inflorescence which may extend for over {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The banana fruit formed are yellow-green, around {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad; they are inedible, with sparse white pulp and many black seeds.<ref name=rhs/><ref>Constantine, D.

==Uses==

===Cultivation===
''Musa basjoo'' has been cultivated both for its fibre and as an [[ornamental plant]] in gardens outside its natural range, first in Japan, and from the late 19th century, in parts of western Europe (north to Britain), the United States, and Canada. In gardens it is used as a hardy 'tropical foliage' plant. Although the pseudostem may only cope with a few degrees below freezing, the underground rhizome is considered frost hardy, if well insulated with thick mulch, in areas with winter temperatures down to {{convert|-12|C|F}}.<ref name="Bananas Raras">{{cite web|title=Banans Raras <U+2013> ''Musa basjoo''|url=http://www.bananasraras.org/basjooengl.htm|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=rhs/> The roots are considered hardy to {{convert|-10|C|F}}.<ref name=Wong13>{{Citation |last=Wong |first=James |year=2013 |title=Kimonos from banana peel? |journal=The Garden |volume=138 |issue=8 |page=17 }}</ref> If the pseudostem is killed, the banana will resprout from the ground where it rapidly grows to full size in a season under optimal conditions. Thus, it can be grown as far north as [[hardiness zone|USDA zone]] 6a. It can also be overwintered under cover in a pot and kept growing, which is the only way it can be made to fruit in northern regions as it requires 12<U+2013>24 months of warmth to bloom.<ref name=rhs/>

===Fibre===
In Japan, the fibres of the plant are used to produce textiles known in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as ''bash<U+014D>fu'' (<U+82AD><U+8549><U+5E03>, lit. "banana cloth"). Whole pseudostems are cut into strips up to 3&nbsp;m long. These are beaten, bleached and dried to produce the raw material, which can then be made into products like hand-knotted carpets, tablecloths, [[kimono]]s and paper.<ref name=Wong13/>

=== Traditional medicine ===
In traditional [[Chinese medicine]], the stem, flower, leaves and rhizome of ''Musa basjoo'' are considered useful for clearing heat-toxins, quenching thirst and disinhibiting urine.<ref>[http://libproject.hkbu.edu.hk/was40/detail?lang=en&channelid=1288&searchword=herb_id=D01178 Musa basjoo Sieb. et Zucc.].
