'''Fanny Jackson Coppin''' ([[October 15]], [[1837]] - [[January 21]], [[1913]]) was an [[African American]] educator and [[missionary]]. Born an American [[Slavery|slave]], Fanny Jackson's freedom was purchased by her aunt at age 12. Fanny Jackson spent the rest of her youth working as a [[servant]] for [[author]] George Henry Calvert, studying at every opportunity. In 1860, she enrolled in [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio, the first [[college]] in the [[United States]] to accept both black and female students. During her years as a student at Oberlin College, she taught an evening course for free slaves in reading and writing, and she graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[1865]].

In [[1865]], Fanny Jackson accepted a position at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia's]] '''Institute for Colored Youth''' (now [[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania]]). She served as the principal of the Ladies Department and taught Greek, Latin, and Mathematics. In [[1869]], Fanny Jackson was appointed as the principal of the Institute after the departure of [[Ebenezer Bassett]], becoming the first African American woman to become a school principal. In her 37 years at the Institute, Fanny Jackson was responsible for vast educational improvements in Philadelphia.

On [[December 21]], [[1881]], Fanny married Reverend [[Levi Jenkins Coppin]], a minister of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. Fanny Jackson Coppin started to become very involved with her husband's missionary work, and in [[1902]] the couple went to [[South Africa]] and performed a variety of missionary work, including the founding of the [[Bethel Institute]], a missionary school with self-help programs. 

After almost a decade of missionary work, Fanny Jackson Coppin's declining health forced her to return to Philadelphia, and she died on [[January 21]], [[1913]]. In 1926, a [[Baltimore]] teacher training school was named the '''Fanny Jackson Coppin Normal School''' (now [[Coppin State University]]).
