The '''Chocolate Hills ''' is an unusual geological formation in [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]].<ref name="eye">[http://www.globaleye.org.uk/secondary_autumn2001/eyeon/land.html Eye on the Philippines] Global Eye Retrieved [[22 December]] [[2006]].</ref>  It is composed of around 1,268 perfectly cone-shaped hills of about the same size, spread over an area  of more than {{convert|50|km2|sqmi}}. They are covered in green grass that turns brown during the dry season,  hence the name.

The Chocolate Hills is a famous tourist attraction of Bohol. It is featured in the provincial flag and seal to symbolize the abundance of natural attraction in the province.<ref>[http://www.bohol.gov.ph/pseal.html The Bohol Flag and Seal] www.bohol.gov.ph Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]].</ref> It is in the Philippine Tourism Authority's list of tourist destinations in the Philippines;<ref>[http://www.philtourism.com/] Philippine tourism Authority </ref> it has been declared the country's 3rd National Geological Monument and proposed for inclusion in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] List.<ref name="unesco">[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5024/ Chocolate Hills Natural Monument] UNESCO World Heritage Centre  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

During the dry season, the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is inadequate such that the grass-covered hills dry up and turn chocolate brown.  This transforms the area into seemingly endless rows of "[[Hershey's Kiss|chocolate kisses]]".

=== Topography ===
[[Image:Chocolate hills-bohol-philippines.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Panoramic View of the Chocolate Hills]]
The Chocolate Hills and the area around it have relatively flat to rolling [[topography]] with elevation ranges from {{convert|100|m|ft}} to {{convert|500|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name="unesco">[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5024/ Chocolate Hills Natural Monument] UNESCO World Heritage Centre  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref> Higher karstic hills dominate the landscape inland then turning almost uniformly and naturally molded in Carmen.<ref name="herbarium">[http://www.pnh.com.ph/category/5-Critical-Plant-Sites/12-Bohol-Island-page-1.html Bohol Island Herbarium] www.pnh.com.ph Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

=== Vegetation ===
[[Image:IMG 0919 Chocolate Hills.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Chocolate Hills Natural Geological Monument]]
The vegetation of the Chocolate Hills is dominated by hardy grass species such as ''[[Imperata cylindrica]]'' and ''[[Saccharum]] spontaneum''. Several ''[[Compositae]]'' and ferns also grow on the hills. In  between the hills, the flat lands are cultivated to rice and other cash crops. However, the natural vegetation on the Chocolate Hills is now highly [[threatened species|threatened]] by [[quarry]]ing activities.<ref

=== Origin ===
[[Image:Chocolate Hills.jpg|left|thumb|300px|The Chocolate Hills in [[Carmen, Bohol]]]]
There are a number of [[geology|geological]] proposals regarding the formation of the hills.  These include simple [[limestone]] [[weathering]], sub-oceanic [[volcanism]], the [[uplift]] of the seafloor and a more recent theory which maintains that as an ancient active volcano self-destructed, it spewed huge blocks of stone which were then covered with limestone and later thrust forth from the ocean bed.<ref>[http://www.tambuli.com/boholactivities.htm Bohol] www.tambuli.com Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]].
</ref> 

[[Geologist]]s have actually long debated about the formation of the hills,  resulting in various ways the origin of the Chocolate Hills are stated or explained. The one written on the bronze plaque at the viewing deck in Carmen, Bohol states that they are eroded formations of a type of marine limestone that sits on top of hardened clay.<ref name="vacation">[http://www.philippinesvacation.org/bohol/chocolate-hills/ Chocolate Hills: Philippines Vacation] www.philipinesvacation.org Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>  The plaque reads: {{cquote|The unique land form known as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol was formed  ages ago by the uplift of coral deposits and the action of rain water and erosion.}}<ref name="vacation"/><ref>[http://www.geocities.com/tataymike/declaration.html Declaration of Chocolate Hills Philippines] www.geocities.com  Retrieved [[16 February]], [[2007]]. </ref>

Another statement says: {{cquote|the grassy hills were once coral reefs that erupted from the sea in a massive [[geologic]] shift. Wind and water put on the finishing touches over hundreds of thousands of years.}}<ref name="vacation"/>

Still another way the origin is stated is that they were formed centuries ago by [[tidal]] movement<ref name="boracay">[http://www.inq7.net/reg/2003/nov/05/text/reg_5-1-p.htm Move over Boracay: Panglao Island beckons] www.inq7.net Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref> and by the uplift of coral deposits and the action of rain water and [[erosion]].<ref name="unesco">[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5024/ Chocolate Hills Natural Monument] UNESCO World Heritage Centre  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref> Another theory is that they were ancient coral limestone reefs shaped by many thousands of years erosion by both water and wind.<ref name="travelguide"> [http://www.philippines-travel-guide.com/bohol-chocolate-hills.html Bohol Chocolate Hills] www.philippines-travel-guide.com Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]].</ref> Geologists  think that the specific shape  of the hills is caused by  the influences of the weather during millions of years. The breaking down of the upper layers of the limestone formations, followed by the erosion processes, resulted in these remnants in the shape of cones.<ref>[http://www.philippines.hvu.nl/bohol1.htm Bohol] www.philippines.hvu.nl  Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]].</ref> It is likely that they were once limestone deposits beneath the sea, uplifted by the movement of plates and then smoothed by wind and rainwater erosion.<ref name="eye"/>

The Chocolate Hills are conical [[Karst topography|karst]] hills similar to those seen in the limestone regions of [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]], only that the Chocolate Hills have no caves.<ref name="travelguide">[http://www.philippines-travel-guide.com/bohol-chocolate-hills.html Bohol Chocolate Hills legend will bring a tear to your eye] www.philippines-travel-guide.com Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]].</ref> According to the karst theory, "sea level changes and uplift combined with terrestrial erosion and air exposure of biogenic reef regions have given rise to hummocky landscapes that are often impregnated with sinkholes and caves."  The Chocolate Hills are considered among the examples of this karst topography.<ref name="cajes"> Cajes, Alan. [http://www.aybpm.freeservers.com/custom2.html A Brief History of Bohol]www.aybpm.freeservers.com Retrieved [[28 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

Similarly, the [[Bungle Bungle]]s in the Purnululu National Park in Western Australia features the similar sedimentary formations.

=== Legend ===
The other explanations come from two [[legend]]s explaining the formation of the Chocolate Hills. The first legend tells the story of two feuding giants who, in battling with each other, hurled rocks, boulders and sand trying to destroy their foe. This fighting lasted days and exhausted the two giants. In their exhaustion, they forgot about their feud and became friends that when they left, they forgot to clean up their mess in the battlefield, hence the Chocolate Hills.<ref name="vacation"/><ref name="travelguide"/>

The much more romantic legend tells of a giant named Arogo who was extremely powerful and youthful. Arogo fell in love with Aloya who was a simple mortal. Aloya<U+2019>s death caused Arogo much pain and misery that in his sorrow, he could not stop crying. When his tears dried the Chocolate Hills were formed.<ref>[http://www.bohol.ph/article6.html The Chocolate Hills] www.bohol.ph Retrieved 14 November, 2006.</ref>

==Tourism development ==
[[Image:sagbayanpeak2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sagbayan Peak]]
The Chocolate Hills placed Bohol on the tourist map long before the beautiful white beaches of the island became major tourist destinations.<ref name="travelguide">[http://www.philippines-travel-guide.com/bohol-chocolate-hills.html Bohol Chocolate Hills, is it really chocolate?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The most famous and signature tourist attraction of Bohol, it is a prime tourist destination in the Philippines.<ref>[http://www.wowphilippines.com.ph/explore_phil/place_details.asp?content=description&province=39 Bohol - splendor underwater and Over Hills] WOW Philippines  Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>  This is because the Chocolate Hills are incomparable and is one of the country's most spectacular sceneries. [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who admits that she is the No. 1 tourist of Bohol for having visited the province so many times, said: {{cquote|Bohol is a major tourist province.

== Protection ==
===Legislation===
[[Image:IMG 0309.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Bronze Plaque at Chocolate Hills Complex View Deck]]
The National Committee on Geological  Sciences declared the Chocolate Hills of Bohol a National Geological Monument on [[June 18]],  [[1988]], in recognition of its special characteristics,  scientific importance,  uniqueness,  and high scenic value.  As such, this included the Chocolate Hills among the country's protected areas.  More protection was provided by Proclamation No. 1037 signed by then President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] upon the recommendation of the DENR on [[July 1]], [[1997]] which establish the Chocolate Hills and the areas within, around, and surrounding them located in the Municipalities of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan, Bilar, Valencia and Sierra Bullones, Province of Bohol as a natural monument to protect and maintain its natural beauty and to provide restraining mechanisms for inappropriate exploitation. As such, they are covered under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) with the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources (Philippines)|Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] (DENR) as the lead implementing agency for its protection.<ref name="hbchoco"/>

Land use conflict prompted Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to sign an amendment to Proclamation 468 dated [[September 26]], [[1994]] declaring the land around or in between Chocolate Hills as no longer part of the national monument during the [[Sandugo Festival|Bohol Sandugo Celebration]] on [[July 17]], [[2002]]. This amendment allowed the tracts of land surrounding and within the famous tourist spot to be developed by the provincial government and other entities that have control over the area. Further, the amended proclamation ensures that the areas that have to be preserved are preserved,  while those that could be developed would be excluded from the national monument area and classified as alienable and disposable by the government. The President initially decided on the issue during the joint meeting of the Regional Development Council-Regional Peace and Order Council (RDC-RPOC) of Region VII which was conducted at the Bohol Tropics Resort.<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/news/printerfriendly.asp?i=1656 GMA seeks development of parts of Chocolate Hills] www.gov.ph Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

On [[July 6]], [[2004]], the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Philippine House of Representatives]] introduced House Bill No. 01147 entitled "an act declaring the Chocolate Hills as national patrimony and geological monuments, penalizing their plunder, destruction or defacement, and for other purposes."  The house bill is authored by Congressman Eladio "Boy" Jala and  co-authored by Congressman Roilo Z. Golez and [[Edgardo Migrino Chatto|Edgar M. Chatto]].<ref name="hbchoco">[http://www.congress.gov.ph/bis/print_history.php?save=1&journal=&switch=0&bill_no=HB01147 House Bill 001147] www.congress.gov.ph  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>

On [[May 16]], [[2006]], the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) submitted the Chocolate Hills to the UNESCO World Heritage for inclusion in the list of Natural Monuments because of its outstanding universal value, falling under criteria vii - superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance. The protection, management, authenticity and integrity of properties are also important considerations.<ref name="unesco">[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5024/ Chocolate Hills Natural Monument] UNESCO World Heritage Centre  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

Amidst reports that [[quarry]]ing has leveled off some of the mounds, Governor Erico Aumentado, the governor of Bohol,  issued Administrative Order No. 3, series of 2006, which prohibits the issuance of quarry permits and favorable endorsements of mining permit applications in Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan towns to forestall any degradation of the Chocolate Hills <U+2013> no matter who applies for such.<ref name="guvbans">[http://www.boholchronicle.com/jun06/11/front3.htm Guv bans mining near Choco Hills] The Bohol Chronicle Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>

The hills are already declared geological monuments and are covered under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) for which the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is the lead implementing agency. Aumentado said: {{cquote|The provincial government is exerting every effort to preserve and maintain the natural wonder <U+2013> including the plains between, connecting and surrounding them <U+2013> since they are the major attractions in Bohol's [[tourism]] industry and a heritage to be shared with the world.}}<ref name="guvbans"> [http://www.boholchronicle.com/jun06/11/front3.htm Guv bans mining near Choco Hills] The Bohol Chronicle Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>

As such, he ordered the prohibition of any quarrying and [[mining]] activities in the three towns. He tasked the Bohol Environment and Management Office (BEMO) to ensure that quarry permit applications or renewal thereof and requests for favorable endorsements of mining permit applications therein shall be denied due course, and to ensure compliance and enforcement of the order.<ref>[http://www.discoverbohol.com/bsp/bsp061106/bsp-HL3-061106.htm Gov issues orders to protect Choco Hills]Bohol Sunday Post Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref> He also enjoined the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of DENR to deny all mining permit applications or renewal in the named towns.<ref name="guvbans"> [http://www.boholchronicle.com/jun06/11/front3.htm Guv bans mining near Choco Hills] The Bohol Chronicle Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>

===Issues===
Balancing their protection, resource utilization and tourism are the challenges faced by the Chocolate Hills. Their declaration as natural geologic monuments had issues. Prior to their being declared as national geological monuments, some of the hills were classified as alienable and disposable or private lands such that they were titled to some locals. The declaration consequently caused some social unrest, resulting in almost simultaneous civil uprising, led by the long-established [[New People's Army]] (generally described as Maoist guerrillas) establishing a new 'front', known as the Chocolate Hills Command.<ref name="karst">[http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FhvX1h89QnfLTBlkYnWQ4XghB1qxnTtl5JNLnT2Xkhr8nVQ6YC4s!-679228738!-182286938?a=o&d=5000939579 Policy and practice in karst landscape protection: Bohol, the Philippines] www.questia.com  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref> To some farmers, the proclamation is a government scheme which suppresses their right to own lands. As such, conflicts between the "command" and government military forces escalated, culminating in two major engagements<ref name="karst"> [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FhvX1h89QnfLTBlkYnWQ4XghB1qxnTtl5JNLnT2Xkhr8nVQ6YC4s!-679228738!-182286938?a=o&d=5000939579 Policy and practice in karst landscape protection: Bohol, the Philippines] www.questia.com  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>

Being alienable and disposable lands, the Chocolate Hills are seen as quarrying assets and source of income for small-scale miners, as well as quarry materials for the province's construction projects. The challenge is how the national and local officials can harmonize the current needs of small-scale miners, the construction sector, the tourism sector, with the preservation of the Chocolate Hills.<ref>[http://www.neda7.net.ph/RA21/CV%20Context%20of%20PA21.htm#bohol CV Context of PA 21]www.neda7.net.ph Retrieved [[17 November]] [[2006]].</ref>

Even with their protected status, mining permits continue to be granted by DENR and local government units or LGUs.<ref name="guvbans"> [http://www.boholchronicle.com/jun06/11/front3.htm Guv bans mining near Choco Hills] The Bohol Chronicle Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref> Hence, mining and quarrying are still taking place. Because of this, the provincial government of Bohol has requested for the transfer of jurisdiction over the Chocolate Hills from the DENR to the provincial government of Bohol.<ref name="karst"> [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FhvX1h89QnfLTBlkYnWQ4XghB1qxnTtl5JNLnT2Xkhr8nVQ6YC4s!-679228738!-182286938?a=o&d=5000939579 Policy and practice in karst landscape protection: Bohol, the Philippines] www.questia.com  Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref> 

Meanwhile, the provincial government has itself suggested that the legislation defining the Natural Monument should be changed, which will require that the proclamation be redrafted and ratified by both the Philippine House and Senate. This is a cumbersome and costly process, on which no progress has been made to date.<ref name="karst"> [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst;jsessionid=FhvX1h89QnfLTBlkYnWQ4XghB1qxnTtl5JNLnT2Xkhr8nVQ6YC4s!-679228738!-182286938?a=o&d=5000939579 Policy and practice in karst landscape protection: Bohol, the Philippines] www.questia.com Retrieved [[14 November]] [[2006]]. </ref>

There are also mounting complaints on poor management and dismal service at the government-owned and operated Chocolate Hills complex and restaurant.<ref name="guvbans">[http://www.boholchronicle.com/jun06/11/front3.htm The Official Website of The Bohol Chronicle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
Added to this is the increase in the number of tourists visiting the Chocolate Hills which has caused traffic problems and safety issues, particularly in the Chocolate Hills complex in [[Carmen, Bohol]].<ref>[http://www.boholchronicle.com/may06/5-14-06/front4.htm PNP takes action on Choco traffic] www.boholchronicle.com Retrieved [[15 November]] [[2006]].</ref>   

Future development and investment challenges within the Chocolate Hills area include: getting the national government to sanction the project; persuading landowners to sell; convincing the Protected Areas Management Board or PAMB which has jurisdiction over the hills not to use its veto power over any investment requiring physical facilities.<ref name="toontown" />   

Since the natural monument proclamation bans "activity of any kind which will alter, mutilate, deface or destroy the hills." A 2003 amendment regulates activity among the privately owned areas "in between hills." 

Filipinos are sensitive to perceived desecrations of so-called heritage sites. In 2003, a public outcry forced a construction firm to stop quarrying at the Chocolate Hills, and was required to restore one defaced hill to its original shape.<ref name="toontown" />

Finally, investment challenges include the fact that speculators bid up property prices in the area, raising the potential cost of a proposed project.<ref name="toontown" /> Getting investors to actually put their money into the poorer parts of [[Bohol]] is complicated by communist guerrillas who extort money from local officials.<ref name="toontown" /> Having refused to pay, Mayor Torrefranca of Sagbayan, Bohol survived two assassination attempts since 1998, when the rebels firebombed his car.<ref name="toontown" />
