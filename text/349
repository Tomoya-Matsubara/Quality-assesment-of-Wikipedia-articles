In October 2009, Virgin Galactic CEO Will Whitehorn outlined the flight test program for SpaceShipTwo. The test program includes seven phases:
<ol><li>Vehicle ground testing.</li>
<li>Captive carry under White Knight Two.<li>
<li>Unpowered glide testing.</li>
<li>Subsonic testing with only a brief firing of the rocket.</li>
<li>[[Supersonic]] [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] testing.</li>
<li>Full flight into suborbital space.</li>
<li>Execute a detailed and lengthy appraisal process with the [[FAA/AST]] to demonstrate the system's robustness and eventually obtain a [[Office of Commercial Space Transportation#Licensed launch vehicles|commercial launch license]] to begin commercial operations.<ref name=Fg20091027ww2>{{Cite video| people = [[Will Whitehorn]]| title = International Astronautical Congress 2009: Civilian Access to Space| medium = video, comments at c. 20:00| publisher = [[Flightglobal]] Hyperbola, Rob Coppinger| location = [[Daejeon, Korea]]| url = http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/hyperbola/2009/10/video-iac2009-civilian-access.html| date = 2009-10-27}}</ref></li></ol>

On 22 March 2010, the SpaceShipTwo vehicle VSS ''Enterprise'' underwent a captive carry test flight, with the parent White Knight Two aircraft, [[VMS Eve|VMS ''Eve'']], performing a short flight while carrying the ''Enterprise''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Maiden flight for Branson's SpaceShipTwo |newspaper=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |date=2010-03-23 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/23/2853436.htm}}</ref>

On 15 July 2010, VSS ''Enterprise'' made its first crewed flight. The craft remained attached to VMS ''Eve'' as planned, and underwent a series of combined vehicle systems tests. The flight lasted a total of 6 hours and 21 minutes. A second, similar crewed flight of VSS ''Enterprise'' and VMS ''Eve'' was carried out on 30 September 2010, lasting approximately 5 hours. Among the objectives of these flights was the improvement of pilot proficiency, and the results of the flights were deemed to show that the systems were capable of supporting future glide missions.<ref name=scWK2SS2testSummaries>

==Future==
[[Virgin Galactic]] aims to become the world's first commercial space line. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, and future tests will focus on rocket motor testing and powered flights. Eventually, the rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space. A total of 370 customers have already placed a deposit (totaling $50 million) for a place on the flight, and about 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list. The trip will cost about US$200,000, and passengers will experience a few minutes of weightlessness during the suborbital flight.<ref name=bbc>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11511604 | work=BBC News | title=Virgin Galactic's spaceship makes solo flight | date=2010-10-10}}</ref><ref name=cnn>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/10/11/california.space.flight/index.html?hpt=C2 | work=CNN | title=Virgin Galactic successfully tests VSS Enterprise | date=2010-10-16}}</ref>

The passenger-carrying commercial launches will initially occur at Virgin Galactic's launch pad at [[Spaceport America]], near [[Upham, New Mexico]].
