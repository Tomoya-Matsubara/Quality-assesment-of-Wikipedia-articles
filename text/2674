'''Ionic<U+0103> T<U+0103>utu''' (usual rendition of '''Ion T<U+0103>utu'''; [[1798]]&mdash;[[1828]]) was a [[Moldavia]]n low-ranking [[boyar]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-inspired [[pamphlet]]eer, and craftsman ("an [[engineer]] by trade", according to [[Alecu Russo]]).<ref>Russo, VI</ref>

==Constitutional project==
The last in a succession of boyars who advanced project of reforms during the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote rule]], T<U+0103>utu stood for the interests of a coalition of low-ranking nobility which aimed to protect itself against competition from modern developments, while adopting various [[Liberalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Romanians|Romanian]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] principles in order to counter the growing political power of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian princes]].<ref>Djuvara, p.318</ref> The entire group was referred to as ''c<U+0103>rvunari'', an antiquated [[Romanian language|Romanian]] rendition of the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''[[carbonari]]'' (although, unlike the latter, they were not organized as a [[secret society]]);<ref>Djuvara, p.318</ref> the reference was to remain a denominator for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] groups in both [[Danubian Principalities]] (Moldavia and [[Wallachia]]) until the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]].

In 1822, under the rule of [[Ioan Sturdza]] (the first non-Phanariote prince in Moldavia), Ionic<U+0103> T<U+0103>utu advanced a thorough [[Constitution|constitutional project]], which soon became highly controversial. The new law proposed ''[[habeas corpus]]'', [[free trade]], as well as a radical definition of [[Property|private ownership]] which denied [[confiscation]] under any circumstances;<ref>Hitchins, p.174</ref> at the same time, it called for a reform of the traditional government by the prince and the [[estates of the realm]] (the [[Sfatul boieresc|Boyar Divan]]), which placed virtually all powers with the latter - thus attempting to preserve [[privilege]]s obtained by boyars in the previous decades.<ref>Djuvara, p.318</ref> Nevertheless, T<U+0103>utu was a cautious adversary of the [[French Revolution]], which he likened to "the [[Anomie|anarchy]] of crowds".<ref>Hitchins, p.172</ref> 

Given that high-ranking boyars had come to dominate the political landscape (and an inner-circle of families had effectively blocked several Phanariote reforms),<ref>Djuvara, p.124</ref> T<U+0103>utu met stiff opposition from the political class: his reforms also attempted to increase representation for low-ranking boyars - a group otherwise threatened with extinction.<ref>Djuvara, p.319</ref> The most noted adversary of his project was [[Mihail Sturdza]] (future prince), who rejected all decrease in influence for the high-ranking boyars. Ultimately, the [[Imperial Russia|Russian]] [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] in [[Ia<U+015F>i]], which had progressively gained influence in internal politics between the 1774 [[Treaty of Kucuk Kaynarca]] and the [[Greek War of Independence]], called for the initiative to be stopped, citing previous treaties between the [[Ottoman Empire]] (Moldavia's [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]) and Russia, as well as the will of [[List of Russian rulers|Emperor]] [[Alexander I of Russia]].

T<U+0103>utu retreated from public life and died in self-exile in [[Istanbul]].

==Legacy==
His image was held in esteem by radical of later generations, and often offered as an example of nationalist revival. [[Alecu Russo]], who wrote his memoirs in the 1850s, described T<U+0103>utu as "the revived Romanianness, carried along by all [[Patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments, and having the same role as the one [[Tudor Vladimirescu|Vladimirescu]] [the leader of the previous [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|Wallachian uprising]]] had with a peasant rifle".<ref>Russo, VI</ref>

Giving evidence of an ultimately [[left-wing]] tradition emerging from low-ranking boyars (in his criticism of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] guidelines advocated by ''[[Junimea]]''), the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] [[Garabet Ibr<U+0103>ileanu]] postulated that Ionic<U+0103> T<U+0103>utu's was a "[[revolution]]ary class" and "the representative of all disinherited classes".<ref>Ibr<U+0103>ileanu, ''Deosebirile dintre vechea <U+015F>coal<U+0103> critic<U+0103> moldoveneasc<U+0103> <U+015F>i "Junimea"''</ref>
