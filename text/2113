<!-- Per MoS the magazine still IS despite being discontinued; issues still physically exist, so it IS a magazine that WAS published -->
'''''Shojo Beat''''' is a [[sh<U+014D>jo manga|''sh<U+014D>jo'' manga]] magazine formerly published in North America by [[Viz Media]]. Released in June 2005 as a sister magazine to ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', it featured serialized chapters from six manga series, as well as articles on Japanese culture, manga, [[anime]], fashion and beauty. After its initial launch, ''Shojo Beat'' underwent two redesigns, becoming the first English anthology to use the [[cyan]] and [[magenta]] ink tones common to Japanese manga anthologies. Viz launched related "Shojo Beat" [[imprint]]s in its manga, Japanese [[light novel]], and anime divisions to coordinate with the magazine's contents.

Targeted at women ages 16<U+2013>18, the first issue of ''Shojo Beat'' launched with a circulation of 20,000. By 2007, the average circulation was approximately 38,000 copies, with half coming from [[Subscription business model|subscriptions]] rather than [[Retailing|store sales]]. It was well-received by critics, who praised its mix of manga series and the inclusion of articles on Japanese culture, though some critics found the early issues boring and poorly written. In May 2009, Viz announced they were discontinuing the magazine; the July 2009 issue was the last released. Fans were disappointed at the sudden news. Industry experts felt its loss would leave female comic fans without a magazine of their own, but praised Viz for its choice to continue using the "Shojo Beat" imprint and branding for its ''sh<U+014D>jo'' manga and anime releases.

==History==
In February 2005, [[Viz Media]] announced the creation of a new manga anthology, ''Shojo Beat''. Marketed as a sister publication of Viz's existing ''[[Shonen Jump (magazine)|Shonen Jump]]'', the magazine started with  six manga titles: ''Crimson Hero'', ''Kaze Hikaru'', ''Baby & Me'', ''Godchild'', ''Nana'', and ''Absolute Boyfriend''.<ref name="VizAnnounce">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-02-08/shojo-beat-details |title=Shojo Beat Details |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=February 8, 2005 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="HappyBirthday" /> Of the six titles, two each came from Japanese publishers [[Shueisha]], [[Shogakukan]], and [[Hakusensha]].  The first issue, released in June 2005, featured [[Nana Komatsu]] of ''[[Nana (manga)|Nana]]'' on its July cover.

Yumi Hoashi was the publication's original [[editor-in-chief]]. In November 2006, Hoashi left Viz and Marc Weidenbaum replaced him as the magazine's editor-in-chief.<ref name="EiC">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-11-15/viz-names-new-shonen-jump-shojo-beat-editor-in-chief |title=Viz Names New Shonen Jump, Shojo Beat Editor-in-Chief |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=November 15, 2006 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="EiC2">{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/9632.html |title=Marc Weidenbaum Named V.P.

With the magazine's first anniversary issue, dated July 2006, ''Shojo Beat'' switched to using [[cyan]] and [[magenta]] ink tones for the manga pages rather than black-and-white. Though this mirrors the format of Japanese manga anthologies, it was a first for manga anthologies published in North America.<ref name="1stAnniversary">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2006-05-15/first-anniversary-issue-of-shojo-beat |title=First Anniversary Issue of Shojo Beat |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>  ''Shojo Beat'' launched another redesign with the January 2007 issue. The new design included more vivid color schemes and [[font]]s and introduced a new "Girl Hero" column to spotlight women Viz felt were charitable and selfless and who would inspire readers.  The existing columns were also expanded.<ref name="Jan 07 Redesign" /><ref name="March 2008 EL" />

In May 2009, the magazine stopped accepting new subscriptions and ceased publication with the release of the July issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-05-19/shojo-beat-magazine-no-longer-accepting-subscriptions |title=Shojo Beat Magazine No Longer Accepting Subscriptions |publisher-[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2009 }}</ref> Existing ''Shojo Beat'' subscriptions were transferred to Viz's ''Shonen Jump'' magazine.<ref name="Viz Confirms Cancellation" /> With the first copy of ''Shonen Jump'' sent to former subscribers, a letter informed them of the transfer and how to request a refund for the unfilled portion of their subscriptions if they would prefer.<ref name="Viz Confirms Cancellation" /><!-- sourced from the letter as well --> In a press release, Viz stated that the "difficult economic climate" was behind the magazine's cancellation.<ref name="Viz Confirms Cancellation">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-05-19/viz-confirms-shojo-beat-manga-magazine-end-in-june |title=Viz Confirms Shojo Beat Manga Magazine's End in June (Updated) |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 19, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2009 }}</ref>

==Features==
As a manga anthology, the bulk of ''Shojo Beat's'' content was its manga chapters. Additional features included a letter from the editor, manga related news, a preview chapter from another Viz manga title being published under the "Shojo Beat" imprint, and articles on [[Japanese culture]], current trends in Japan, and fashion and beauty. Sections toward the back of the magazine featured fan-related material, including [[fan art]], letters from readers, manga drawing lessons, and [[cosplay]] how-to guides and highlights.<ref name="HappyBirthday" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shojobeat.com/inthemagazine/33.php |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |work=Shojo Beat Online |title=In the Magazine |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> The magazine's official website included additional articles, downloads of templates for dressing up the magazine's panda mascot "Moko", and online previews of many of the manga series being published under the "Shojo Beat" label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shojobeat.com/downloads/ |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |work=Shojo Beat Online |title=Downloads |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref>

===Series===
''Shojo Beat'' contained chapters from six Japanese [[manga]] series licensed and translated to English by Viz.<ref name="HappyBirthday" /><ref name="SB Expand">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2005-12-15/shojo-beat-expanded-content-for-january-2006 |title=Shojo Beat-Expanded content for January 2006 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 15, 2005 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref> During its run, the magazine featured fourteen series, of which seven ended their runs and were replaced by other series. Only four of those replacements remained in the magazine until all of their chapters had been published. Each title serialized in the magazine was also published in ''[[tank<U+014D>bon]]'' volumes under Viz's "Shojo Beat" label. Viz noted that it periodically removed incomplete series from the magazine to help "keep the magazine fresh" and to allow it to speed up publication of the individual volumes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2006-08-19/godchild-not-returning-to-shojo-beat |title=Godchild Not Returning to Shojo Beat |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=August 19, 2006 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}</ref>

===Imprints===
With the launch of the ''Shojo Beat'' magazine, Viz Media created new imprints for its manga and fiction lines. The "Shojo Beat" imprint included series featured in the magazine as well as other [[sh<U+014D>jo manga|''sh<U+014D>jo'' manga]] titles licensed by Viz after the magazine's conception.  Viz began releasing a few Japanese [[light novel]]s under a "Shojo Beat Fiction" imprint that were related to its "Shojo Beat" manga titles.<ref name="VizNovels">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-06-04/viz-to-publish-novels |title=Viz to Publish Novels |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=June 4, 2005 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="VizNovels2">{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6985.html |title=Viz Launches New Fiction Imprints |publisher=ICv2 News |date=June 6, 2005 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> In February 2006, Viz launched the  "Shojo Beat Home Video" line for releasing [[anime]] titles primarily designed for female viewers.  The first title under the new imprint was ''[[Full Moon o Sagashite]]'', the anime adaptation of the same titled manga that was also released by Viz. To promote the new anime line, Viz included a preview disc of the first volume of ''Full Moon'' in the June 2006 issue of ''Shojo Beat''.<ref name="SBVideo">{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/8244.html |title=Viz Launches Shojo Beat Home Video Line |publisher=ICv2 News |date=February 20, 2006 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> Though the magazine itself has been canceled, Viz stated in May 2009 that it will continue releasing both existing and new series under the "Shojo Beat" manga and anime imprints.<ref name="Viz Confirms Cancellation" />

==Circulation and audience==
When ''Shojo Beat'' launched, it had a circulation of 20,000.<ref name="HappyBirthday">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2007-05-14/viz-media-happy-birthday-shojo-beat-magazine |title=Viz Media Happy Birthday Shojo Beat Magazine |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 14, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> In 2006, its average circulation had increased to 35,000, of which 41% were distributed through subscriptions, and the rest sold in newsstands and stores.<ref name="PW">{{cite news |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6434448.html |firstname=Brigid |lastname=Alverson |date=April 17, 2007 |work=PW Comics Week |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |title=Shojo Beat Marks Second Year |accessdate=February 11, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Viz2007PK">{{cite press release |url=http://www.shojobeat.com/mediakit/SB_Media_Kit_200701.pdf |format=pdf |title=Shojo Beat Media Kit (January 2007) |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |year=2007 |month=January |accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}</ref> In 2007, the circulation grew to 38,000, and subscriptions increased to 51%.<ref name="Viz2008PK">{{cite press release |url=http://www.shojobeat.com/mediakit/SB_Media_Kit_2008.pdf |format=pdf |title=Shojo Beat Media Kit (January 2008) |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |year=2008 |month=January |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080401201804/http://www.shojobeat.com/mediakit/SB_Media_Kit_2008.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2008 }}</ref> The magazine's audience was overwhelmingly female, comprising 91% of its readers.

==Reception==
''Shojo Beat'' was nominated for a 2008 [[Anime Expo#Organizational structure|Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Award]] in the category of "Best Publication", but lost to Japan's ''[[Newtype (magazine)|NewType]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2008-03-27/society-for-the-promotion-of-japanese-animation-announces-spja-industry-award-finalists-at-tokyo-international-anime-fair |title=Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Announces SPJA Industry Award Finalists at Tokyo International Anime Fair |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=July 4, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2008-07-04/anime-expo-2008-announces-the-2008-spja-award-winners |title=Anime Expo<U+00AE> 2008 Announces the 2008 SPJA Award Winners |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=July 4, 2008 |accessdate=July 4, 2009 }}</ref>

In reviewing the premiere release of ''Shojo Beat'', [[IGN]]'s Jessica Chabot sharply criticized the magazine. She felt it looked and read "like a teenie-bopper magazine" and referred to the issue's cover as a "bright, hot-pink, migraine-inducing, bubble-lettered spectacle". She considered the contents boring, and disagreed with Viz's selection of series, noting, "it's as if Viz had taken everything from their backed-up reject pile and tried to pull one over on the female populace. 90% of what I was reading was either poorly drawn or poorly written (more often than not, it was both)."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/632/632083p1.html |title=Shojo Beat: The Verdict |first=Jessica |last=Chabot |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 5, 2005 |accessdate=September 30, 2008 }}</ref> ''Comic World News''' David Welsh disagreed, as he felt that the magazine had several good series, and he praised ''[[Nana (manga)|Nana]]'', ''[[Absolute Boyfriend]]'' and ''[[Crimson Hero]]'' as the top three series of the initial issue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicworldnews.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi?column=flipped&page=26 |title=Title Pun Shortage Strikes Manga Columnist |first=David |last=Welsh |work=[[Comic World News]] |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2008 }}</ref> Greg McElhatton, co-founder of ''[[Wizard: The Guide to Comics]]'' and former reviewer for iComics.com, praised the magazine's mainstream appearance, calling it a "smart" decision, as it would draw in its target audience by visually showing them that it's a magazine for teenage girls. While he felt that two of the manga titles in the premiere issue had weak openings, he found that the magazine was "off to a good, if not great start".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2005/06/15/shojo-beat-vol-1-issue-1/ |title=Shojo Beat Vol. 1, Issue 1 |first=Greg |last=McElhatton |publisher=[[Read About Comics]] |date=June 15, 2005 |accessdate=October 1, 2008 }}</ref>

After its cancellation, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''{{'}}s [[Heidi MacDonald]] reported that the common response she saw from fans was that "everyone liked it but nobody paid for it". She noted that many fans expressed sorrow over the magazine's demise while indicating that they did not subscribe to it.<ref name="Publishers Weekly Demise">{{cite web |url=http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2009/05/20/shojo-beat-cancellation-reax/ |title=Shojo Beat cancellation reax |first=Heidi |last=MacDonald |work=[[Publishers Weekly|Publishers Weekly: The Beat]] |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 21, 2009 }}</ref> Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for [[PopCultureShock]], remarked that the magazine had offered "just the right mixture of new stories, continuing series, and articles" and praised it for having a "funky, [[DIY]] vibe".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mangacritic.com/?p=542 |title=R.I.P.

Two staffers questioned Viz's decision to drop the magazine and wondered if the company had unrealistically expected the magazine to have the same circulation numbers as ''Shonen Jump''.<ref name="SLJ">{{cite web |url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/blog/540000654/post/1810044981.html |title=Rountable: Farewell to Shojo Beat |first1=Brigid |last1=Alverson |work=[[School Library Journal]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=May 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 23, 2009 }}</ref>
