The '''Long-tailed Meadowlark''' (''Sturnella loyca'') is a [[passerine]] [[bird]] of southern [[South America]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], belonging to the [[meadowlark]] genus ''Sturnella'' in the [[icterid]] family.

It is 25 to 28 cm long with a fairly long tail and a long, pointed bill. The male is mostly dark brown with blackish streaking. The breast and throat are bright red and there is a white spot on the face near the base of the bill. The bold [[supercilium]] is white behind the eye and red in front of it. Females are paler than the males. The red markings are restricted to a wash on the belly and the supercilium and throat are buff.

It breeds in southern [[Chile]] and southern and western parts of [[Argentina]]. Some birds migrate northwards in winter. An endemic [[subspecies]] occurs in the [[Falkland Islands]]. Long-tailed Meadowlarks are found in open habitats such as grassland where they forage on the ground, feeding mainly on [[invertebrate]]s.

The [[nest]] is made of dry grass and is built by the female. It is placed on or near the ground amongst grass. Two clutches of two to four [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are laid during the breeding season. They are bluish-white with dark blotches and streaks.
