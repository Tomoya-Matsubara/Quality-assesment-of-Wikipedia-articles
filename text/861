In 2003, the [[New York Times]] identified Satanicide as the greatest mock metal band.<ref name="Lindgren"/> In that same year, the group were described in ''[[The Drama Review]]'' as an "irreverent, demonic death-metal turned glam turned cock-rock band".<ref name="TDR">{{cite journal |last=Brehm |first=Katharine A. |year=2003 |month=Spring |title=Satancide |journal=[[TDR/The Drama Review]] |publisher=MIT Press Journals | volume=47 |issue=1 (T177) |pages=86<U+2013>88 |doi=10.1162/105420403321250026 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/105420403321250026 |accessdate=2008-06-20 |quote=" Popular on the current New York music scene, this irreverent, demonic death-metal turned glam turned cock-rock band spawns a certain mood in their per-formances that supports not only their raucous music, but also a wildly funny, exaggerated stage show with improvised audience embellishment."}}</ref> The original four member band consists of [[frontman]] Dale "Devlin Mayhem" May, [[guitarist]] Phil "Aleister Cradley" Costello, [[drummer]] Andrew "Sloth Vader" Griffiths, and [[bassist]] Pemberton "The Baron Klaus Von Goaten" Roach.<ref name="Lustig"/> Pemberton was replaced by [[bassist]] Sebastian "Vargas Von Goaten" in 2003.<ref name="Peisner">Peisner, David.

==History==
In the late 1990s, Dale May and Phil Costello (a [[real estate lawyer]])<ref name="Gorce">La Gorce, Tammy. (May 14, 2006) [[New York Times]] ''[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/14njMUSIC.html Music; Sure, I Rock, But I Need Health Care.]'' Section: 14NJ; Page 10.</ref> were in a group called Peanut 23.<ref name="Lindgren"/> Peanut 23s quirky original songs were far from successful.<ref name="Lindgren"/> One night, both May and Costello put on their girlfriends' wigs and spent the evening "acting like a couple of kids in from Jersey, kicking over trash cans, talking the talk."<ref name="Lindgren"/> After a positive reception that night to an uninvited, impromptu performance on a club's stage, May and Costello decided to form their own band.<ref name="Lindgren"/> [[Guitarist]] Andrew Griffiths was recruited from a [[trip hop]] band called Puracane and [[bassist]] Pemberton Roach was added to complete ''Satanicide.''<ref name="Lindgren"/>

In August 1999, Satanicide played the famed [[Maxwell's]] music club in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].<ref>[[ New York Times]] (August 1, 1999) ''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E5D81431F932A3575BC0A96F958260 On the towns.]'' Section: 14NJ; Page 12.</ref> Previously used to getting maybe 30 people to come out for a Peanut 23 show, Satanicide brought in hundreds.<ref name="Lindgren"/> In January 2003, Satanicide played a [[gig]] at the [[2003 Sundance Film Festival]] in support of a short film made by the band.<ref name="Lindgren"/>

By March 2003, Satanicide was a popular act on the [[Music of New York City|New York music scene]].<ref name="Brehm">Brehm, Katharine A. (March 2003) [[TDR (journal)|The Drama Review]] ''[[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/the_drama_review/v047/47.1brehm.pdf Satanicide.]'' Volume 47; Issue 1; Page 86.</ref> Their irreverent, demonic [[death metal]] music evoke a certain mood that was supported by a humorous stage show with improvised audience embellishment.<ref name="Brehm"/> The [[William Morris Agency]] agreed to represent Satanicide and worked with the band to produce a [[film treatment]] for a television series.<ref name="Lindgren"/> However, May and Costello's songwriting chemistry did not translate into scriptwriting chemistry and the treatment was tabled.<ref name="Lindgren"/>

Four years after they formed, Satanicide sought to replace [[bassist]] Pemberton Roach in August 2003 because Roach "secretly liked [[Billy Joel]]."<ref name="Lindgren"/><ref name="Huhn">Huhn, Mary. (August 17, 2003) [[New York Post]] ''High notes & low notes.'' Section: New York Pulse; Page 44.</ref> In advertising for the bassist position, Satanicide listed the required qualifications as musical "[[Wiktionary:chops|chops]]"; "hott<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[sic]]] [[Groupie|girlfriend]] to share with band"; "disposable income to buy [[cocaine|coke]], booze and whores"; and "when hearing the [[Dave Matthews Band]], must be overcome by impulsive desire to kill."<ref name="Huhn"/> Sebastian "Vargas Von Goaten" replaced Pemberton in 2003.<ref name="Peisner"/>

In September 2004, the website heatherband.com was created.<ref>[http://www.who.is/whois-com/ip-address/heatherband.com/ who.is heatherband.com]</ref> In December 2004, Satanicide announced that it changed its name to ''Heather'', the band, listing heatherband.com as their website.<ref name=Stewart>Stewart, Sara. (December 12, 2004) [[New York Post]] ''Hot List - What we're obssessed with this week.'' Section: Sunday Pulse; Page 84.</ref> In addition, the group became "the group formerly known as Satanicide" and got rid of the big-hair wigs and at least some of the shtick.<ref name=Stewart/> In July 2005, Satanicide announced that it was getting together for a reunion performance at the [[Bowery Ballroom]], a music venue in the [[Bowery (Manhattan)|Bowery]] section of [[New York City]].<ref name="Jonestown">Huhn, Mary. (July 29, 2005) [[New York Post]] ''We dig Brian Jonestown Massacre.'' Section: New York Pulse; Page 65.</ref> Some question whether they in fact broke up in the first place.<ref name="Jonestown"/>

By May 2005, Satanicide had appeared in a [[Cingular]] commercial and were headlining at the Bowery Ballroom.<ref name="Gorce"/> In April 2007, the [[Chinese race|Chinese]] [[gangsta]] rapper trio [[Notorious MSG]] released their Lunch Money EP, with Satanicide's [[guitarist]] Phil "Aleister Cradley" Costello providing the guitar music to the Warlord song.<ref> Mazmanian, Adam. (May 11, 2007) [[Washington City Paper]] ''Lunch Money EP.'' Volume 27; Issue 19; Page 48.</ref> As of June 2008, Costello additionally was with the band Tragedy, described as a heavy metal [[Bee Gees]] tribute act where Costello played the [[Barry Gibb|Barry Glibb (sic)]] character.<ref>Lustig, Jay. (June 6, 2008) [[The Star-Ledger]] ''Bee Gees inspire unlikely musical fusion.'' Section: Tickets.; Page 22.</ref>

==Presentation==
A Satanicide show is an unpredictable event that is a bit dangerous and above all funny.<ref name="Lindgren"/> In their act, the band members hurl themselves into the crown to scatter their fans like bowling pins as a way of mocking the rocker practice of [[stage diving]]/[[crowd surfing]].<ref name="Lindgren"/> They wear Barbie wigs to give them the [[big hair]] appearance of a [[glam metal]] rocker.<ref name="Lindgren"/> In addition to this New York-based band claiming that they are from "[[New Jersey|Jer-Z]]," they spout elaborate lies related to cheap-sex conquests and call to mind ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]],'' the [[1984 in film|1984]] [[mockumentary]] directed by [[Rob Reiner]] about a dreadful metal band becoming famous.<ref name="Lindgren"/> The Satanicide members typically wear sleeveless T-shirts and circulation-inhibiting leather pants while they convincingly mimic many styles of [[Heavy metal|metal]].<ref name="Lindgren"/> Their act calls to mind a mixture of [[Probot]], [[Tenacious D]], [[The Darkness]], [[The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years]], [[The Upper Crust]], and [[This Is Spinal Tap]].<ref name="Lindgren"/>
