'''''Goosebumps''''' is a series of children's horror fiction novels by American author [[R. L. Stine]], initially published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Publishing]]. The stories follow child characters, who find themselves in scary situations.

From 1992 to 1997, 62 books were published under the ''[[Goosebumps (original series)|Goosebumps]]'' umbrella title. Various spin-off series were written by Stine: ''[[Goosebumps Series 2000]]'', ''[[Give Yourself Goosebumps]]'', ''[[List of Goosebumps books#Tales to Give You Goosebumps|Tales to Give You Goosebumps]]'', ''Goosebumps Triple Header'', ''[[Goosebumps HorrorLand]]'', and ''[[Goosebumps Most Wanted]]''. Another series, ''[[List of Goosebumps books#Goosebumps Gold|Goosebumps Gold]]'', was never released. ''Goosebumps'' has spawned a [[Goosebumps (TV series)|television series]] and merchandise.

Since the release of its first novel, ''[[Welcome to Dead House]]'', in July 1992, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial success worldwide. As of 2012, the series has sold over 300 million books worldwide in 32 languages, and individual books in the series have been listed in many [[bestseller]] lists, including the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for children. Two reviewers of the series thought the quality of the ''Goosebumps'' literature was not good, but others were happy the books got children excited about reading.

==Structure and genre==
[[File:Goosebumpscastwithstine.PNG|thumb|left|An illustration of R. L. Stine with some of his creations. This illustration was from the cover of Stine's autobiography, ''It Came from Ohio!: My Life as a Writer''.]]
The ''Goosebumps'' series falls under the children's fiction, horror and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] genres, although Stine characterizes the series as "scary books that are also funny."{{sfn|Foerstel|2002|p=222}} Each book features different child characters<ref name="characters">{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Joyce M. |title=Goosebumps: So successful they're scary |work=[[Lawrence Journal-World]] |date=October 27, 1996 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rpcyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i-cFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6505,6031347 |accessdate=December 25, 2010 }}</ref> and settings.{{sfn|Westfahl|2000|p=44}} The primary [[protagonist]]s are middle class and can be either male or female.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=69}}

The primary protagonists of a ''Goosebumps'' story are often situated in a remote location or somehow isolated from typical societal conventions. This can range anywhere from comfortable suburban areas to [[boarding school]]s, foreign villages or campsites.<ref name="foreign">{{cite web |title=Get Goosebumps with R.L. Stine |work=ChennaiOnline |url=http://chennaionline.com/Books/Author/GET-GOOSEBUMPS-WITH-RLSTINE.aspx |accessdate=December 30, 2010 }}</ref> Books typically feature characters who either recently moved to a new neighborhood or are sent to stay with [[Kinship|relative]]s.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=69}}

The books in the ''Goosebumps'' series feature similar plot structures{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=68}} with fictional children being involved in scary situations.{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=71}} The books are mostly written in first person [[narrative]], often concluding with [[twist ending]]s.{{sfn|Coats|2004|p=170}} They contain [[Surrealism|surreal]] horror,{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=69}} with characters encountering the strange and [[supernatural]].{{sfn|Cullinan|Person|2005|p=707}}

The author has plot devices that he follows throughout his ''Goosebumps'' books. He does not have any death in his stories, and the children in his novels are never put into situations that would be considered too serious.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web |url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-09-04/lifestyle/35494341_1_goosebumps-books-deeper-theme |title=<U+2018>Goosebumps<U+2019> writer R.L.

==Inspiration and themes==
Books and characters in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character [[Slappy the Dummy]] was inspired by the literary classic ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.<ref name="inspiration">{{Cite web |last=Stine |first=R.

Stine uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember what it feels like to be afraid and panicky".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rif.org/kids/readingplanet/bookzone/stine2.htm |title=R.L.

The ''Goosebumps'' books in this series featured one main story in every book.

The books in the ''[[List of Goosebumps books#Tales to Give You Goosebumps|Tales to Give You Goosebumps]]'' and ''Goosebumps Triple Header'' series were written as short story anthologies, featuring a collection of stories in each book.{{sfn|Marcovitz|2005|p=117}} From 1994 to 1997, six ''Tales to Give You Goosebumps'' books were published.

Due to declining ''Goosebumps'' sales and increasing competition, Scholastic and Stine decided to create ''[[Goosebumps Series 2000]]''.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=152<U+2013>153}} From 1998 to 2000, 25 books in the series published, beginning with ''Cry of the Cat''. The books in this series were written in a similar format and featured similar content to the original series,{{sfn|Morris|2000|p=67}} but Stine classified them as being "much scarier."<ref name="publisher"/> The covers in this series were illustrated by Tim Jacobus.<ref name="illustrations"/>

In this series, Stine intended to write a sequel to ''The Haunted Mask II'' (''The Haunted Mask Lives!''), and a sequel to ''Welcome to Dead House'' (''Happy Holidays from Dead House'').

Two reviewers of the ''Goosebumps'' books did not feel that the books were high quality literature. ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'''s Marc Silver thought the series was "quite tame".

Stine's books have a reputation for getting children excited about reading, which the writer is very proud of.<ref name="NPR"/> James Carter, writing in ''Talking Books: Children's Authors Talk About the Craft, Creativity and Process of Writing'', stated "regarding ''Point Horrors'' and ''Goosebumps'', I feel that anything that children read avidly is a good thing."{{sfn|Carter|1999|p=216}} Librarian and writer Patrick Jones commented that "[t]he real horror is a culture where kids, especially boys, don<U+2018>t read<U+2014>and Stine has done his best to stop that turn of the screw from happening in his lifetime."{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=203}}
