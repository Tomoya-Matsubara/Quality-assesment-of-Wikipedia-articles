'''Hurricane Isaac''' was the final [[tropical cyclone]] of the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]]. Isaac originated in a [[tropical wave]] that entered the Atlantic Ocean on September 18. An associated area of disturbed weather eventually organized sufficiently to be declared a tropical depression on September 27, while located {{convert|930|mi|km|abbr=on|lk=on}} southeast of Bermuda. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm just 12 hours later, though unfavorable atmospheric conditions, including high [[wind shear]] and cool water temperatures, initially inhibited further intensification. Isaac ultimately peaked as a Category 1 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], and brushed [[Newfoundland]] as a tropical storm. Effects from the storm were minimal and limited to gusty winds, rough surf, and sporadic rainfall.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Isaac 2006 track.png}}
A [[tropical wave]] emerged from the western coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean on September 18, 2006. On September 23, an associated area of disturbed weather began to exhibit indications of organization; in response, [[Dvorak technique|Dvorak classifications]] were initiated. Influenced by moderate to strong [[wind shear]], the system moved west-northwestward for several days. Once environmental conditions became more favorable for tropical cyclone development, the storm had sufficiently organized to be designated a tropical depression on September 27. At this time, the depression was located about {{convert|930|mi|km|abbr=on|lk=on}} southeast of [[Bermuda]].<ref name="TCR">{{cite web|author=Michelle Mainelli|title=Hurricane Isaac Tropical Cyclone Report|date=November 16, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/TCR-AL092006_Isaac.pdf}}</ref> Despite being upgraded, deep [[convection (meteorology)|convection]] had not wrapped around the entire [[tropical cyclone#structure|center of circulation]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mainelli/Pasch|title=Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number 1|date=September 27, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al09/al092006.discus.001.shtml?}}</ref> Although the depression was approaching tropical storm status by later on September 27, wind shear continued to affect the cyclone.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown/Knabb|title=Tropical Depression Nine Discussion Number 2|date=September 27, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al09/al092006.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref> On September 28<U+2014>about 12 hours after the storm's formation<U+2014>it became the ninth tropical storm of the [[2006 Atlantic hurricane season]], and received the name Isaac.<ref name="TCR"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Brown/Knabb|title=Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number 4|date=September 28|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al09/al092006.discus.002.shtml?}}</ref>

Initially, the storm was tracking towards the northwest, between another low pressure system to its west and a low- to mid-level [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to its east. Throughout the day, thunderstorm activity remained unstable, possibly as a result of cooler waters churned up by previous storms. In addition, mid- to upper-level dry air had become entrained into the circulation, and the storm contained some [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical characteristics]] with a [[baroclinic]]-type cloud pattern.<ref name="TCR"/> By early September 29, Isaac had slowed and turned towards the west.<ref>{{cite web|author=Beven|title=Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number 7|date=September 29, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al09/al092006.discus.007.shtml?}}</ref> Convection began to intensify and consolidate later that day; [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]] had also improved, and became more symmetric in nature.

However, this period of intensification was short-lived, and the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) at around 0000 UTC on October 1.<ref name="TCR"/> Around that time, a ragged [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] feature appeared on satellite imagery.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lindsea/Stewart|title=Hurricane Isaac Discussion Number 15|date=October 1, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al09/al092006.discus.015.shtml?}}</ref>

While tracking towards the north-northeast, the storm began to gradually weaken as a result of increasing southwesterly wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures.<ref name="TCR"/> At about 1200 UTC on September 2, Isaac was downgraded to a tropical storm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brown/Pasch|title=Tropical Storm Isaac Discussion Number 20|date=September 2, 2006|publisher=National Hurricane Center|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2006/al09/al092006.discus.020.shtml?}}</ref> The storm passed about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the the [[Avalon Peninsula]] on October 2, spawning tropical storm-force winds on land. After passing [[Newfoundland]] Isaac transitioned into an [[extratropical storm]], and subsequently merged with a larger storm on September 3.<ref name="TCR"/>

==Preparations and impact==
{{wikinews|Hurricane Isaac heads toward Atlantic Canada}}
A [[tropical storm watch]] was issued in response to Isaac on October 1 for the Avalon Peninsula. The watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning the next day, while a separate watch was posted for the [[Burin Peninsula|Burin]] and [[Bonavista Peninsula|Bonavista]] peninsulas, though it was quickly discontinued. By 2100 UTC on October 2, all [[tropical cyclone watches and warnings]] were lifted.<ref name="TCR"/> Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were expected, prompting the issuance of rainfall warnings for parts of southeastern Newfoundland, while wind and gale advisories were declared offshore.<ref>{{cite web|author=Szeto/Fogarty|title=Hurricane Isaac Information Statement|date=October 1, 2006|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.atl.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20061001233924.Isaac.txt.en}}</ref>

On October 2, the ''Elektra'' (call sign SIWB) reported winds of {{convert|52|mph|km/h|abbr=on|lk=on}} while located about {{convert|170|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the east of the storm's center. Two other ships, several buoys, and several oil platforms also recorded tropical storm-force winds.<ref name="TCR"/> Waves offshore reached {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on}} in height.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bowyer|title=Corrected Tropical Storm Isaac Information Statement|date=October 2, 2006|publisher=Canadian Hurricane Centre|accessdate=2009-06-20|url=http://www.ns.ec.gc.ca/weather/hurricane/bulletins/20061002180428.Isaac.txt.en}}</ref>

Impacts on land were generally insignificant; no damages or fatalities were reported. However, parts of the Avalon Peninsula experienced tropical storm conditions. At [[Cape Race]], sustained winds peaked at {{convert|46|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with gusts of up to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The most intense winds remained offshore. Due to the storm's rapid passage, rainfall was primarily light and amounted to less than {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name="TCR"/>
