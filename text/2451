The '''Port Chicago disaster''' was a deadly [[explosion]] that took place on July 17, 1944 at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in [[Port Chicago, California]]. [[Ammunition|Munitions]] being loaded aboard a cargo vessel bound for the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]] detonated, killing 320 [[sailor]]s and [[civilian]]s and injuring 390 others. Most of the dead and injured were enlisted [[African American]] sailors.

A month later, continuing unsafe conditions inspired hundreds of servicemen to refuse to load munitions, an act known as the '''Port Chicago Mutiny'''. Fifty men, called the '''Port Chicago 50''', were convicted of [[mutiny]] and sentenced to long prison terms. Forty-seven of the 50 were released in January 1946; the remaining three served additional months in prison.

During and after the trial, questions were raised about the fairness and legality of the [[court-martial]] proceedings.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 130<U+2013>133.</ref> Due to public pressure, the [[United States Navy]] reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 133.</ref> Widespread publicity surrounding the case turned it into a ''cause celebre''<ref>Center of Military History, Washington DC.

==Background==
[[File:PortChicago-aerial-construction.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph looking eastward in early 1944. The town of [[Port Chicago, California|Port Chicago]] is in the upper right. The lower left shows utility and personnel piers extending toward the two sections of Seal Island. The munitions loading pier curves to the left beyond 20-odd [[revetment]]s. Marshy tidal zones separate the munitions pier from barracks buildings near the personnel pier and near the town.]]
The town of Port Chicago was located on [[Suisun Bay]] in the estuary of the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s. Suisun Bay is connected to the [[Pacific Ocean]] by [[San Francisco Bay]]. In 1944, the town was a little more than a mile from a US Navy munitions depot, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, which was later expanded and renamed the [[Concord Naval Weapons Station]]. The original magazine was planned in 1941 with construction beginning shortly after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The first ship to dock at Port Chicago was loaded on December 8, 1942.<ref>Bell, ''Naval Mutinies of the Twentieth Century'', 198.</ref>

Munitions transported through the magazine included [[bomb]]s, [[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s, [[naval mine]]s, [[torpedo]]es and [[Ammunition#Firearms ammunition|small arms ammunition]].  The munitions, destined for the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]], were delivered to the Port Chicago facility by rail then loaded by hand, crane and [[winch]] onto cargo ships for transport to the war zones. From the beginning, all the enlisted men employed as loaders at Port Chicago were African Americans; all their commanding officers were white.<ref name = "Hist">History.com. Black History.

===Quality of men===
At NSGL, the enlisted African Americans who tested in the top 25 to 40 percent were selected for non-labor battalion assignments. Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined that the quality of African-American [[petty officer]]s at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts of men with clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy.<ref name=NavyFAQ804a>US Navy Historical Page.

Retrieved on December 17, 2008.</ref> Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.<ref name=NavyFAQ804a/>

Black laborers at Port Chicago were led by black petty officers who were regarded by some workers as incompetent and ineffective in voicing their men's concerns to higher authority.<ref name="Allen 52<U+2013>53"/> Petty officers were seen as having fundamentally different aims than their men<U+2014>they were described later as "slave drivers" and "[[Uncle Tom]]s".<ref name="Allen 52<U+2013>53"/> They and their men sometimes struck an antagonistic relationship.<ref name="Allen 52<U+2013>53">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 52<U+2013>53.</ref>

Captain Merrill T. Kinne, commander of the Port Chicago facility at the time of the explosion, had served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and had returned to the Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had no training in the loading of munitions and very little experience in handling them.<ref name="Allen 44"/> White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or in handling munitions until they had been posted to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]], after which they were considered adequate to the task by the Navy.<ref name=NavyFAQ804a/>

===Speed contests and safety training===
Since April 1944 when Captain Kinne assumed command of Port Chicago, the loading officers had been pushing the enlisted men to load the explosive cargoes very quickly; ten tons per hatch per hour<ref name=NavyFAQ804a/> had been set as the desired level by Captain Nelson Goss, Commander Mare Island Naval Shipyard, whose jurisdiction included Port Chicago Naval Magazine.<ref>Astor, ''The Right to Fight'', 264.</ref> Most loading officers considered this goal too high.<ref name=NavyFAQ804a/> On a prominent chalkboard Kinne tallied each crew's average tonnage per hour.<ref name="Allen 44">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 44.</ref> The junior officers placed bets with each other in support of their own 100-man crews (called 'divisions' at Port Chicago) and coaxed their crews to load more than the others. The enlisted men were aware of the unsanctioned nature of the bets and knew to slow down to a more reasonable pace whenever a senior officer appeared.<ref name="Allen 109"/> The average rate achieved at Port Chicago in the months leading up to July 1944 was 8.2 tons per hatch per hour; commercial stevedores at Mare Island performed only slightly better at 8.7 tons per hatch per hour.<ref name=NavyFAQ804a/>

There was no system at Port Chicago for making sure officers and men were familiar with safety regulations. Two formal lectures and several informal lectures were given to the enlisted men by commanding officers, but follow-up confirmation of retained knowledge did not take place. Safety regulations were posted at a single location at the pier but not within each of the barracks<U+2014>Kinne did not think the enlisted men would be able to comprehend such a list.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 45.</ref> The [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union]] (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer,<ref name="Bell 201">Bell, ''Naval Mutinies of the Twentieth Century'', 201.</ref> fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 42.</ref> No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received formal training in the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.<ref name="Allen 41"/>

===Winch maintenance===
Powered [[winch]]es were used on cargo ships to speed the handling of heavy loads. One winch was operated at each of the ship's five [[Hold (ship)|cargo holds]]. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance in order to remain operable. Winch brakes, a safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lost, were not often used by a skilled winch operator as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS ''E. A. Bryan'' were [[Steam engine|steam-powered]] and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 25.</ref>

On July 13, 1944, the day that the ''E. A. Bryan'' docked at Port Chicago, the ship's No.&nbsp;1 winch brakes were found stuck in the "off" position, meaning that the winch could be operated freely, but lacked the critical stopping capability if steam pressure was interrupted.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 26.</ref> The ship's chief mate and chief engineer were called to examine the winch but it was never determined whether the brake was made operational. During loading operations on July 15 the winch at No.&nbsp;2 hold began making a hammering noise. A steady application of grease quieted it through the night until its main bearing could be replaced the next morning on July 16. On the afternoon of July 17, a bleeder valve on winch No.&nbsp;4 required immediate repair. Albert Carr, a [[civil service]] plumber from [[Pittsburg, California]], was called to replace it; it was his first day at Port Chicago. Carr pulled a broken [[Nipple (plumbing)|nipple]] out of the bleeder valve and replaced both the nipple and the valve from new stock taken from Port Chicago's shop. While at work, he witnessed a man accidentally drop a [[naval artillery]] shell two feet onto the wooden pier but there was no detonation. Carr waited until the African-American winch operator successfully tested the newly-repaired winch, then hurriedly left the pier, thinking that the whole operation appeared unsafe.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 26<U+2013>27.</ref>

===Munitions handling===
The enlisted men were leery of working with deadly explosives but were told by officers that the larger munitions were not active and could not explode&mdash;that they would be armed with their [[Fuse (explosives)#Munition fuzes|fuzes]] upon arrival at the combat theater.<ref name=nps>National Park Service. Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial. "[http://www.nps.gov/poch/faqs.htm Frequently Asked Questions]". Retrieved on March 5, 2009.</ref> Handling of the larger munitions such as bombs and shells involved breaking individual munitions out with levers and crowbars from boxcars in which they were packed tightly with [[dunnage]], lifting the heavy cylindrical shapes coated with grease,<ref name="Bell 201"/> rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them via winch and [[Boom (sailing)#Other boom uses|boom]], lowering the bundle into the hold, and then dropping the individual munitions a short distance by hand into place.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 46.</ref> This series of actions was rough enough that naval shells were sometimes damaged and began leaking identification dye from their ballistic caps.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 51.</ref>

Commander Paul B. Cronk, head of a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] explosives-loading detail tasked with supervision of the working dock, warned the Navy that conditions were unsafe and ripe for disaster.<ref name="Bell 201"/> The Navy refused to change its procedures and Cronk withdrew the detail.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 45<U+2013>46.</ref><ref>United States Coast Guard.

==Explosion==

The [[Liberty ship]] SS ''E. A. Bryan'' docked at the inboard, landward side of Port Chicago's single {{convert|1500|ft|m|-1|adj=on}} pier at 8:15&nbsp;a.m. on July 13, 1944. The ship arrived at the dock with empty cargo holds but was carrying a full load of 5,292&nbsp;barrels (841,360&nbsp;liters) of [[Fuel oil#Bunker fuel|bunker C]] heavy [[fuel oil]] for its intended trip across the Pacific Ocean. At 10&nbsp;a.m. that same day,<ref name=NavyFAQ804b/> seamen from the ordnance battalion began loading the ship with munitions. After four days of around-the-clock loading, about 4,600&nbsp;tons (4,173&nbsp;metric tons)<ref name=NavyFAQ804b/> of explosives had been stored in its holds. The ship was about 40% full by the evening of July 17.

At 10 p.m. on July 17, Division Three's 98 men were loading ''E. A. Bryan'' with {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-1|adj=on}} bombs into No.&nbsp;3 hold, 40&nbsp;mm shells into No.&nbsp;5 hold and fragmentation cluster bombs into No.&nbsp;4 hold.<ref name="Allen 57">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 57.</ref> Incendiary bombs were being loaded as well; these bombs weighed 650&nbsp;pounds (290&nbsp;kg) each and were 'live'<U+2014>they had their [[Fuse (explosives)#Munition_fuzes|fuzes]] installed.

A boxcar delivery containing a new airborne anti-submarine [[depth charge]] bomb design, the Mark&nbsp;47 armed with {{convert|252|lb|kg|-1}} of [[torpex]], was being loaded into No.&nbsp;2 hold. The torpex charges were more sensitive than [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] to external shock and container dents.<ref>Guttridge, ''Mutiny'', 212.</ref> On the pier, resting on three parallel rail spurs, were sixteen rail cars holding about 430&nbsp;tons (390&nbsp;metric tons) of explosives.<ref name=NavyFAQ804b/> In all, the munitions on the pier and in the ship contained the equivalent of approximately 2,000&nbsp;tons of TNT.<ref name=NavyFAQ804b/>

One hundred two men of the Sixth Division, many fresh from training at NSGL, were busy rigging the newly-built [[Victory ship]] SS ''Quinault Victory'' (also spelled ''Quinalt'') in preparation for loading it with explosives, a task which was to begin at midnight.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 56.</ref> The ''Quinault'' contained a partial load of fuel oil, some of which was of a type that released flammable fumes over time or upon agitation. The fuel, taken aboard at [[Shell Oil Company]]'s [[Martinez, California|Martinez]] refinery mid-day on July 17, would normally be sluiced to other fuel tanks in the following 24&nbsp;hours.<ref name=NavyFAQ804b>US Navy Historical Page.

A total of 67 officers and crew of the two ships were at their stations, and various support personnel were present such as the three-man civilian train crew and a Marine sentry. Nine Navy officers and 29 armed guards watched over the procedure. A Coast Guard fire barge with a crew of five was docked at the pier. An officer who left the docks shortly after 10&nbsp;p.m. noticed that the ''Quinault'''s [[Propeller#Marine|propeller]] was slowly turning over and that the men of Division Three were having trouble pulling munitions from the rail cars because they had been packed so tightly.<ref name="Allen 57"/>

==Aftermath==
[[Image:Portchicago2.jpg|thumb|right|Cleaning up the damage at the remains of the pier]]
After the fires had been contained there remained the gruesome task of cleaning up&mdash;body parts and corpses littered the bay and port. Most of the uninjured sailors volunteered to help clean up and rebuild the base; Division Two was separated into a group that would stay and clean up and a group that would be moved out. This section of Division Two and all of Divisions Four and Eight were transferred to [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Shoemaker]], about 30 miles south, where they were assigned barracks duty until July 31, 1944. The men of Divisions One, Five and Seven were reassigned other duty in distant locations and shipped out. The cleanup detail from Division Two dug into the wreckage of the pier and began tearing out the damaged portions. Beginning in August, Divisions Four and Eight and both sections of Division Two moved to the Ryder Street Naval Barracks in [[Vallejo, California]] across a short channel from [[Mare Island, California|Mare Island]], where they were assigned barracks duties with no ship-loading. The men were in a state of shock; all were nervous. Many of them inquired about obtaining a 30-day "survivor's leave" sometimes given by the Navy to sailors who had survived a serious incident where their friends or shipmates had died, but no 30-day leaves were granted, not even to those who had been hospitalized with injuries. White officers, however, received the leave, causing a major grievance among the enlisted men.<ref>{{cite journal|quotes=no|last=Seligson|first=Tom|date= February 6, 2005|title=Isn't it Time To Right The Wrong?|journal=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2005/edition_02-06-2005/featured_1|accessdate=December 12, 2008|quote=None of the black sailors were granted leaves...

A [[Naval Board of Inquiry]] was convened on July 21, 1944 to find out what had happened. The official proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 70.</ref>

[[Image:PortChicagoBoxcarRevetment.jpg|thumb|left|Boxcars within their revetments near the pier were crushed by the pressure of the blast.]]The inquiry covered possible explosion scenarios involving sabotage, faulty fueling procedures, failure of the moorings of the ''Quinault Victory'', defects in munitions, the presence of a supersensitive element in the ordnance, problems with steam winches and rigging, rough handling by loaders and organizational problems within the base. The Navy determined that the tonnage contest between divisions was not at fault, although the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate]] warned that "the loading of explosives should never be a matter of competition."<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 72.</ref> The officers in charge were cleared of guilt. The report stated that the cause of the explosion could not be determined, but implied that a mistake made by the enlisted men in the handling of the ordnance was most likely at root.<ref>Bell, ''Naval Mutinies of the Twentieth Century'', 203.</ref> No mention was made of the men's lack of training in the handling of explosives.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 71.</ref>

The Navy asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to give each victim's family $5,000. Representative [[John E. Rankin]] of Mississippi insisted the amount be reduced to $2,000 when he learned most of the dead were black men.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 67.</ref> Congress settled on $3,000 in compensation, and interred what little remained of the victims in a local cemetery with tombstones reading "Unknown, US Navy, 17 July 1944".<ref name="Bell 203">Bell, ''Naval Mutinies of the Twentieth Century'', 203.</ref> Years later, on March 4, 1949, the heirs of eighteen merchant seamen killed in the explosion were granted a total of $390,000 after gaining approval of their [[consent decree]]s in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California]].<ref>{{cite news

A memorial ceremony was held for the victims on July 31, 1944. Admiral [[Carleton H. Wright]], Commander, [[United States Naval Districts#12th Naval District|12th Naval District]], spoke of the unfortunate deaths and the need to keep the base operating during a time of war. He gave [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]]s for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier.<ref name="Bell 203"/>

Wright soon began implementing a plan to have two groups of white sailors load ammunition in rotation with black sailors: one division of 100 men at Mare Island and another at Port Chicago. No plan was forwarded to use black officers to command the black sailors, and no plan included any form of desegregation.<ref name="Allen 90">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 90.</ref> Wright sent a report of the incident to Washington, DC, telling his superior officers that the men's "refusal to perform the required work arises from a mass fear arising out of the Port Chicago explosion."<ref name="Allen 90"/> Wright's report was passed to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] by [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[James Forrestal]] who added his opinion that it was "mass fear" motivating the work stoppage. Forrestal told Roosevelt that white units of munitions loaders were to be added to the rotation in order "to avoid any semblance of discrimination against negroes [''[[sic]]'']".<ref name="Allen 90"/> Roosevelt forwarded a copy to his wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], knowing of her ongoing advocacy of [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896<U+2013>1954)|civil rights for African Americans]].<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 91.</ref>

==Port Chicago mutiny==
===Initial actions===
Divisions Two, Four and Eight, reinforced with replacement sailors fresh from training at NSGL, were taken to [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]] where there was an ammunition depot and loading piers. On August 8, 1944 the {{USS|Sangay|AE-10|6}} docked to be loaded with naval mines and other munitions. Three hundred twenty-eight men were asked to resume the dangerous task of ammunition loading; all said they were afraid and that they would not load munitions under the same officers and conditions as before. It was a mass work stoppage, which would have been called a [[Strike action|strike]] if the workers had been civilians.<ref name="Allen 81<U+2013>82">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 81<U+2013>82.</ref>

Seventy of the men changed their minds after their superior officers made it clear that loading ammunition was their duty. On August 9, 258 African-American sailors in the ordnance battalion continued to refuse to load ammunition. These men were taken under guard to a barge which was used as a temporary [[military prison]] or "brig", despite having been built to accommodate only 75 men. Most of the men in the brig had not been given a direct order<U+2014>they had simply been asked if they were going to load ships or not, and to step to one side if not. All said they were afraid of another explosion.<ref name="Allen 81<U+2013>82"/> Civilian stevedore contractors were called to replace the imprisoned men in loading the ''Sangay''.<ref name="Allen 81<U+2013>82"/>

Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph "Joe" Small, a winch operator in Division Four and a natural leader who called cadence when his division marched, was asked by officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting [[petty officer]]s and to keep the other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10 there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the [[mess]] hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small sensed a general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to "knock off the horseplay", stay out of trouble and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) would be worse. He said to the men "We've got the officers by the balls<U+2014>they can do nothing to us if we don't do anything to them. If we stick together, they can't do anything to us."<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 82<U+2013>84.</ref>

On August 11, 1944 the 258 men from the prison barge were marched to a nearby sports field and lectured by Admiral Wright who told them that troops [[Battle of Saipan|fighting on Saipan]] desperately needed the ammunition they were supposed to be loading and that continued refusal to work would be treated as mutinous conduct which carried the [[Capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]] in times of war. Wright, who had seen nearly 400 of his men killed in 1942 in the [[Battle of Tassafaronga]], said that although loading ammunition was risky, [[Execution by firing squad|death by firing squad]] was the greater hazard.<ref>Guttridge, ''Mutiny'', 214.</ref>

After the admiral departed, the men were ordered to separate themselves into two groups, one for those willing to obey all orders and one for those not willing. To a man, Division Eight chose to obey all orders. Divisions Two and Four were split by the decisions of their men: Small and 43 others chose to form a group unwilling to obey every order. These 44 were taken back to the brig and the remaining 214 were sent to barracks. On the morning of August 12, six men from Divisions Two and Four who had put themselves in the obey-all-orders group failed to show up for work call; these six were confined to the brig, making 50 prisoners in all. These 50 were identified by the Navy as mutineers.<ref name="Allen 86">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 86.</ref>

Throughout August, all 258 sailors were taken to Camp Shoemaker and questioned. Forty-nine of the 50 'mutineers' were imprisoned in the camp's brig. Joe Small was placed in [[solitary confinement]]. Each of the men was interviewed by officers, sometimes in the presence of an armed guard. Questions focused on identifying 'ringleaders' of the work-stoppage and on what was said by whom at the meeting on the prison barge. The men were asked to sign statements summarizing the interrogation, but the officer's version rarely matched the enlisted man's recollection of the interview. Some men, upon seeing that the written statements did not reflect what they had said, refused to sign. Others felt they had no choice but to sign<U+2014>they were being ordered to do so by an officer. Several men refused to give any statement at all. Others spoke freely, thinking that the officer was there as [[Criminal defense lawyer|defense counsel]].<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 87<U+2013>88.</ref>

After all the interviews concluded, the group of 208 men were convicted in summary courts-martial of disobeying orders, Section 892 of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. Each man was subject to forfeiture of three months' pay.<ref>Guttridge, ''Mutiny'', 220.</ref> A few of them were held as witnesses in the upcoming mutiny trial. The rest were split into smaller groups and shipped out to various places in the Pacific Theater. Carl Tuggle, one of the 208, said in 1998 that a group of prisoners including himself were assigned menial tasks such as cleaning latrines and picking up cigarette butts at a series of Pacific islands.<ref name=Tuggle>PortChicagoMutiny.com.

===Port Chicago 50===
The 50 remaining men, soon to be known as the "Port Chicago 50", were formally charged in early September 1944 with disobeying orders and making a mutiny "with a deliberate purpose and intent to override superior military authority". This was a crime punishable by death since the United States was at war. Even if the men were not given death sentences, they could get prison terms of fifteen years.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 126.</ref>

[[File:Treasure island from yerba buena.jpg|thumb|right|Treasure Island in 2007]]The Navy set up the court-martial in a disused Marine barracks building at [[Treasure Island (California)|Treasure Island]], halfway between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Francisco]]. Reporters from the major and local newspapers were invited to watch the proceedings; Navy public relations officers gave reporters copies of photographs and press statements describing the trial as the first mutiny trial in World War II and the largest mass trial the Navy had ever convened. Chosen to head the seven-man court was Rear Admiral Hugo Wilson Osterhaus, [[United States Naval Academy]], class of 1900. The prosecution team was led by Lieutenant Commander James F. Coakley who had recently served as deputy chief prosecutor in [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] under district attorney [[Earl Warren]]. Defending the accused men were six Navy lawyers, one as leader of the team and one attorney for every ten men. Lieutenant Gerald E. Veltmann headed the defense.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 92<U+2013>93.</ref>

Veltmann and his team talked to the accused men prior to the trial in order to prepare their defense. They discovered that not all of the 50 were experienced ship loaders. Two of the men taken to the brig had never before loaded ammunition<U+2014>they were permanently assigned as cooks because of physical conditions making them unsuited to loading. The two cooks had responded "no" when asked if they would load munitions. Another of the 50 had a broken wrist in a sling; he, too, was asked if he would load ammunition to which he replied that he would not.<ref name="Allen 86"/> More importantly, Veltmann sensed that the men had not conspired to seize command from their superior officers. In a pre-trial brief, Veltmann cited the definition of mutiny from ''Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents'' and asked that the mutiny charges be dismissed as the formal charges against the 50 men failed to allege that they conspired together deliberately to "usurp, subvert or override superior military authority".<ref name="Allen 94">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 94.</ref> Coakley opposed with a brief stating that, under [[military law]], a persistent refusal to work by two or more men<U+2014>something that might be called a 'strike' among civilians<U+2014>was sufficient proof of a conspiracy to override superior military authority and was equivalent to mutiny.<ref name="Allen 94"/> Osterhaus agreed with Coakley and refused Veltmann's motion; the trial would proceed as planned.<ref>Guttridge, ''Mutiny'', 218<U+2013>220.</ref>

===Prosecution===
The trial started on September 14 with each of the 50 men pleading "not guilty". Coakley began his prosecution by calling officers from Port Chicago and Mare Island as witnesses. Commander Joseph R. Tobin of Ryder Street Naval Barracks said that he personally ordered six or seven of the men to load munitions on August 9 but was unable to verify if any others were so ordered. He said that the men he had spoken with were willing to follow any order except to load munitions; that each man expressed fear of another explosion. Tobin verified that the men were not aggressive or disrespectful. Lieutenant Ernest Delucchi, Commander of Division Four at Port Chicago, testified that he personally ordered only four of the 50 defendants to load munitions.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 98.</ref> Delucchi described overhearing men of Division Eight say to his men "Don't go to work for the white motherfuckers" but, under [[cross-examination]], was unable to identify who said it. Veltmann objected to this [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]] but was overruled after Coakley explained it was evidence toward conspiracy.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 96.</ref>

On September 15 Delucchi continued his testimony, saying that some of his men told him they would obey all orders and perform all work except loading ammunition because they were afraid of it. Delucchi confirmed that a cook and a man with a broken wrist were among the 25 men in his division that now sat among the 50 accused. Delucchi added that the cook and a second man were sailors he did not consider "up to par"; the cook in particular was prone to nervous attacks and was seen as a liability at the pier.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 99.</ref>

Later in the trial, Lieutenant Carleton Morehouse, Commander of Division Eight at Port Chicago, took the stand to say that at the first sign of problems on August 9, he assembled his men and read their names off alphabetically, ordering each man to work. 96 of 104 refused and were sent to the prison barge, but all of these men agreed to work after hearing Admiral Wright's speech on August 11; none of Morehouse's men were on trial for mutiny. Morehouse confirmed to Veltmann that some of his men had said they were afraid to handle ammunition. Following Morehouse, Lieutenant James E. Tobin, Commander of Division Two, took the stand. Lieutenant Tobin (no relation to Commander Joseph R. Tobin) related that 87 of his men initially refused to work but that number was reduced to 22 after Admiral Wright talked about the firing squad. Tobin said he put three additional men in the brig the next morning when they, too, refused to work, saying they were afraid. Tobin affirmed that one of the accused men from Division Two was permanently assigned the job of cook because he weighed {{convert|104|lb|kg}} and was considered too small to safely load ammo.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 101.</ref>

The next few days of testimony were filled with accounts from African-American enlisted men from Divisions Two, Four and Eight, who were not standing accused of mutiny. Some of these men had already been convicted of disobeying orders in summary courts-martial. The testimony of the men agreed on several points: that there had been talk among them of a mass work-stoppage leading up to August 9, that some men (none of the accused 50)<ref name="Allen 86"/> had passed around and signed a petition to avoid loading ammunition, and that Joe Small had spoken at the meeting on the prison barge and had urged the men to obey their officers and to conduct themselves in an orderly fashion. Some men said Small's speech included words to the effect of having the officers "by the tail" or "by the ass". Coakley was challenged by Veltmann when he attempted to bring the men's signed statements in as evidence but the court allowed the statements to be used to refresh the men's memories of their answers to interrogation.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 102.</ref>

Coakley summed up his prosecution case on September 22. His aim was to show the court that a conspiracy had taken place<U+2014>the mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning that they could not all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 102<U+2013>103.</ref>

===Defense===
Veltmann scored a victory at the beginning of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in practice it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, the court was observed by reporters to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 104.</ref>

Starting on September 23 and continuing for over three weeks, each of the accused men was brought to the witness stand to testify in his defense. The general trend of the men's responses was that all of them were willing to obey any order except to load ammunition, all were afraid of another explosion, and none had been approached by 'ringleaders' persuading them not to work<U+2014>each had made his own decision. Each man said that he himself had not coerced others to refuse to work. Some of the men related how, following the official interrogation at Camp Shoemaker, they had been under great pressure to sign statements containing things they had not said. Some men said that, at the meeting on the barge, Joe Small had not urged a mutiny and had not uttered any phrase to the effect of having the officers "by the balls". On the witness stand, Small himself denied saying any such thing, though he would admit to it decades later in interviews.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 106, 112.</ref>

Coakley's cross-examinations began with an attempt to have the signed statements admitted as evidence. Veltmann objected that each statement was obtained under duress and was not voluntary. Coakley characterized the statements as not being confessions requiring voluntary conditions but merely 'admissions' that had no such requirement. Osterhaus ruled that Coakley could not introduce the statements as evidence but that he could ask the defendants questions based on what each man's signed statement contained.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 106<U+2013>107.</ref>

Some of the men who had been named as having been given direct orders to work testified that they had not been given any such order. Seaman Ollie E. Green, who had accidentally broken his wrist one day prior to the first work-stoppage on August 9, said that though he had heard an officer in prior testimony name him as one who had been given a direct order, the officer had only asked him how his wrist was doing, to which he responded "not so good."<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 108.</ref>

At the end of his testimony, Green told the court that he was afraid to load ammunition because "them officers racing each division to see who put on the most tonnage, and I knowed the way they was handling ammunition it was liable to go off again. If we didn't want to work fast at that time, they wanted to put us in the brig, and when the [[Executive Officer#United States|exec]] came down on the docks, they wanted us to slow up."<ref name="Allen 109">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 109.</ref> This was the first that the newspaper reporters had heard of speed and tonnage competition between divisions at Port Chicago, and each reporter filed a story featuring this revelation to be published the next day. Naval authorities quickly issued a statement denying Green's allegation.<ref name="Allen 109"/>

Another one of the men gave the surprising testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to have him shot after he refused to answer some questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 116.</ref>

[[File:1936 Thurgood Marshall NAACP.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thurgood Marshall]] in 1936]]October 9, 1944 was another in a string of days consisting of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, [[Thurgood Marshall]], chief counsel for the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance relative to the US Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Though Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he would not be offered an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 116<U+2013>118.</ref> The next day, Marshall held a press conference, saying that Judge Advocate Coakley was prejudiced in the way he handled the case. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 118.</ref>

The defense continued a few more days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man.  A black petty officer under Delucchi testified that he had heard no derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a surprise to everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 118<U+2013>119.</ref>

Thurgood Marshall put himself in the news once again on October 17 with the announcement that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions that had led the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put the great majority of African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training which led to catastrophic detonation, and the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers when their actions with regard to loading ammunition after the explosion were not significantly different than the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9 but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 119<U+2013>120.</ref>

Coakley's rebuttal witnesses consisted of officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann was able to elicit from them that some of the accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had been afraid of another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 120<U+2013>121.</ref>

===Closing arguments===
In his closing argument, Coakley described a chronological sequence of mutinous occurrences, beginning at Camp Shoemaker shortly after the explosion when two and a half companies were mixed together for two weeks. Coakley stated that conspiratorial talk among the men about refusing to work and trying to get out of loading ammunition was the root of their August 9 mass refusal. Coakley described how the mutiny continued in the barge when Joe Small spoke to the men and asked them to stick together. Coakley entered into the record his definition of mutiny: "Collective insubordination, collective disobedience of lawful orders of a superior officer, is mutiny."<ref name="Allen 122<U+2013>126"/> He gave his opinion that men who admitted in time of war that they were afraid to load ammunition were of a low moral character and were likely to give false testimony.<ref name="Allen 122<U+2013>126">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 122<U+2013>126.</ref>

Veltmann denied that there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were in a state of shock stemming from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.<ref name="Allen 122<U+2013>126"/>

===Verdict===
On October 24, 1944, Admiral Osterhaus and the other six members of the court deliberated for 80&nbsp;minutes and found all 50 defendants guilty of [[mutiny]]. Each man was reduced in rank to [[Seaman Apprentice]] and sentenced to 15&nbsp;years of [[hard labor]] to be followed by [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorable discharge]]. The men were held under guard while their sentences were passed to Admiral Wright for review. On November 15, Wright reduced the sentences for 40 of the men: 24 were given twelve years, 11 were given ten years and the five youngest sailors were given eight-year sentences. The full 15-year sentences remained in place for ten of the men including Joe Small and Ollie Green.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 126<U+2013>127.</ref> In late November, the 50 men were transferred to the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island]] in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]] near the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Port of Long Beach]].<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 128.</ref>

===Appeal and release===
During the 12 days that he watched the court-martial proceedings, Thurgood Marshall began to formulate an appeal campaign. Marshall had noticed that none of the men's grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions; why had they not been trained for that task; why were they forced to compete for speed; why were they not given survivor's leaves; and why had they not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly,<ref name="Allen 131">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 131.</ref> saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago so of course they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a "trial period", and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he thought it best for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.<ref name="Allen 131"/>

Marshall, working as special counsel for the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|NAACP Legal Defense Fund]], determined that the first course of action should be a publicity campaign mounted with the aim of gathering public support for the release of the men. In November 1944 Marshall wrote an incendiary piece for ''Crisis'' magazine, published by the NAACP. Pamphlets were printed and distributed, and editorials denouncing the trial appeared from African-American publishers in January 1945. Petitions began to circulate, collecting thousands of names of citizens who demanded a reversal of the mutiny verdict. Protest meetings were held and powerful people in sympathy to the cause were asked to bring pressure to bear. Eleanor Roosevelt sent Secretary Forrestal a copy of NAACP's 'Mutiny' pamphlet in April 1945, asking him to take special care in this case.<ref name="Allen 132<U+2013>133">Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 132<U+2013>133.</ref>

Marshall obtained written permission from each of the 50 convicted men for him to appeal their case when it came up for review in Washington, DC in front of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy. On April 3, 1945 he appeared to present his arguments. Marshall's appeal made the case that no direct order was given to all 50 of the defendants to load munitions and that even if orders had been given to certain individuals, disobeying the orders could not constitute mutiny. He said that Coakley deliberately misled the court on the definition of 'mutiny' and that the mass of evidence he introduced was hearsay, thus [[Admissible evidence|inadmissible]]. Marshall wrote that "The accused were made scapegoats in a situation brought about by a combination of circumstances. [...] Justice can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of the findings."<ref name="Allen 132<U+2013>133"/> Marshall said "I can't understand why whenever more than one Negro disobeys an order it is mutiny."<ref name="Allen 132<U+2013>133"/>

The office of the Secretary of the Navy ordered Admiral Wright to reconvene the courts-martial, this time with instructions to disregard the hearsay testimony. Admiral Osterhaus once again called the court to session for deliberation and on June 12, 1945 the court reaffirmed each of the mutiny convictions and sentences. Admiral Wright stuck by his reduced sentences.<ref name="Allen 132<U+2013>133"/>

After the [[surrender of Japan]] and the cessation of hostilities, the Navy was no longer able to justify such severe sentences as a warning to other potentially dissident servicemen and labor battalions.<ref name="Allen 132<U+2013>133"/> In September 1945, the Navy shortened each of the 50 mutiny sentences by one year. Captain [[Harold Stassen]] recommended in October that the Navy reduce the sentences to just two years for men with good conduct records and three years for the rest, with credit for time served.<ref>Allen, ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', 133<U+2013>134.</ref> Finally, on January 6, 1946<ref>{{cite news

The Port Chicago disaster highlighted systemic racial inequality in the Navy.<ref name="Wagner 856">Wagner et al, ''The Library of Congress World War II Companion'', 856.</ref> A year before the disaster, in mid-1943, the US Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but no black officers.<ref>Guttridge, ''Mutiny'', 211.</ref> In the months following the disaster, the [[New Pittsburgh Courier|''Pittsburgh Courier'']], a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their ongoing "Double V" campaign, a push for victory over not just the [[Axis powers]] but also over racial inequality at home.<ref name="Wagner 856"/> The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] relations in the [[armed forces]] at the time.<ref>Astor, ''The Right to Fight'', 266.</ref>

Late in 1944, under conditions of severe racism, a [[Agana race riot|race riot broke out in Guam]] at a naval base. In March 1945 a [[Seabee]] battalion of 1,000 African-American men staged a hunger strike at their base in [[Port Hueneme, California]] in protest of discriminatory conditions. In the weeks following the latter incident, [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Ernest King]] and Secretary Forrestal worked with civilian expert [[Lester Granger]] on a plan for total integration of the races within the Navy.

Freddie Meeks, one of the few still alive<!--when?--> among the group of 50, was urged to petition the President for a [[pardon]].

==Nuclear bomb theory==
The Port Chicago explosion was studied by the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] team working on the [[Manhattan project]]. The resulting damage was seen as being similar to the effects of a relatively small [[nuclear explosion]] with destructive power equivalent to 2,000&nbsp;tons of TNT. Paul Masters, a photo technician at Los Alamos, made copies of some of the study documents and stored them at his home. In 1980, Peter Vogel discovered one of Masters' documents in a rummage sale and noticed that one section of text read "Ball of fire mushroom out at 18,000&nbsp;ft in typical Port Chicago fashion".<ref>{{cite web|last=Vogel|first=Peter|title=The Last Wave from Port Chicago: Keyword|publisher=Archived by Archive.org Wayback Machine on February 10, 2008|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070821081333/www.portchicago.org/lastwave/keyword.htm|accessdate=March 5, 2009|quote="History of 10,000 ton gadget": document purloined, winter 1944<U+2013>45, from the Manhattan Project Los Alamos Laboratories by photo technician Paul Masters; mathematical model prediction of the progression and effects of the explosion of the Mark IV weapon detonated 16 July 1945 at New Mexico Trinity site; prepared by Los Alamos scientists Joseph O.
