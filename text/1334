'''SM ''U-27''''' or '''''U-XXVII''''' was the [[lead boat]] of the [[U-27 class submarine (Austria-Hungary)|''U-27'' class]] of [[U-boat]]s or [[submarine]]s for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. ''U-27'' was built by the Austrian firm of [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT) at the [[Pola Navy Yard]] and [[launch (ship)|launch]]ed on 19 October 1916. She was [[commission (ship)|commission]]ed on 24 February 1917.

She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] and was just over {{convert|121|ft|m}} in length. She [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] nearly {{convert|265|MT|LT|0}} when surfaced and over {{convert|300|MT|LT|0}} when submerged. Her two [[diesel engine]]s moved her at up to {{convert|9|knots|km/h}} on the surface, while her twin [[electric motor]]s propeller her at up to {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while underwater. She was armed with two bow [[torpedo tube]]s and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a {{convert|75|mm|in|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[deck gun]] and a [[machine gun]].

During her service career, ''U-27'' sank the British destroyer {{HMS|Phoenix|1911|2}}, damaged the Japanese destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Sakaki||2}}, and sank or captured 34 other ships totaling {{GRT|14,386|first=short}}. ''U-27'' was surrendered at [[Pula|Pola]] at war's end and handed over to Italy as a [[war reparation]] in 1919. She was broken up the following year. ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906<U+2013>1921'' calls ''U-27'' Austria-Hungary's "most successful submarine".

== Design and construction ==
[[Austria-Hungary]]'s U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of [[World War I]].<ref name=Con-341>Gardiner, p. 341.</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five [[German Type UB I submarine|Type UB I]] submarines that comprised the {{sclass|U-10|submarine|4}} from Germany,<ref name=Con-343>Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine [[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] as {{SMS|U-14|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}},<ref name=Con-341 /><ref group=Note>[[French submarine Curie (Q 87)|''Curie'']] had been caught in an [[anti-submarine net]] while trying to enter the harbor at [[Pula|Pola]] on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343.</ref> and by building four submarines of the {{sclass|U-20|submarine|4}} that were based on the 1911 Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class]].<ref name=Con-344>Gardiner, p. 344.</ref><ref group=Note>The plans for the Danish [[Havmanden class submarine (1911)|''Havmanden'' class submarines]], three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from [[Whitehead & Co.]] in [[Fiume]]. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354.</ref>

After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs,<ref name=Con-341 /> the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the [[German Type UB II submarine|German Type UB II]] design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.<ref name=Hal-383>Halpern, p. 383.</ref> The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary.<ref name=Hal-383 /> The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from [[AG Weser]] of [[Bremen]].<ref name=BS>Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted [http://www.gwpda.org/naval/ahsubs.htm here] (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 1 December 2008.</ref>

''U-27'' displaced {{convert|264|MT|LT}} surfaced and {{convert|301|MT|LT}} submerged.<ref name=Con-344 /> She had a single [[submarine hull|hull]] with [[saddle tank]]s,<ref name=Con-181>Gardiner, p. 181.</ref> and was {{convert|121|ft|1|in|m}} long with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|14|ft|4|in|m}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|12|ft|2|in|m}}.<ref name=Con-344 /> For propulsion, she had two shafts, twin [[diesel engine]]s of {{convert|270|bhp|abbr=on}} for surface running, and twin [[electric motor]]s of {{convert|280|shp|abbr=on}} for submerged travel. She was capable of {{convert|9|knots|km/h|1}} while surfaced and {{convert|7.5|knots|km/h}} while submerged.<ref name=Con-344 /> Although there is no specific notation of a range for ''U-27'', the German UB II boats, upon which the ''U-27'' class was based, had a range of over {{convert|6000|nmi|km}} at {{convert|5|knots|km/h}} surfaced, and {{convert|45|nmi|km}} at {{convert|4|knots|km/h}} submerged.<ref name=Con-181 /> ''U-27'' class boats were designed for a crew of 23<U+2013>24.<ref name=Con-344 />

''U-27'' was armed with two {{convert|45|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} bow [[torpedo tube]]s and carried a complement of four torpedoes. She was also equipped with a 75<U+00A0>mm/26 (3.0<U+00A0>in) [[deck gun]] and an {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]].<ref name=Con-344 />

After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms,<ref name=Hal-383 /> ''U-27'' was ordered from [[Cantiere Navale Triestino]] (CNT) on 12 October 1915.<ref name=Miller-20 /> She was [[keel laying|laid down]] by early 1916 at the [[Pola Navy Yard]],<ref group=Note>By this time, the [[Cantiere Navale Triestino|CNT]] shipyards at [[Monfalcone]] had been overrun by the [[Italian Army]].

In mid-May 1917, ''U-27'' participated in a support role in a raid on the [[Otranto Barrage]] that precipitated the [[Battle of Otranto Straits (1917)|Battle of Otranto Straits]]. On the night of 14/15 May, the Austro-Hungarian cruisers {{SMS|Helgoland|Austria-Hungary|2}}, {{SMS|Saida||2}}, and {{SMS|Novara|1912|2}} attacked the [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifters]] that deployed the [[anti-submarine net]]s that formed part of the Barrage, sinking 14, damaging 5, and taking 72 prisoners.<ref name=Gib-254>Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 254<U+2013>55.</ref><ref group=Note>[[Joseph Watt]], the commander of the British [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]] ''Gowan Lea'', was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions in refusing to surrender to one of the Austrian cruisers.</ref> Destroyers {{SMS|Csepel||2}} and {{SMS|Balaton||2}} were sent to simultaneously attack Italian transports shuttling between Italy and [[Vlor<U+00EB>|Valona]], and sank an Italian destroyer and a munitions ship. ''U-27'', which was assigned to patrol between [[Brindisi]] and [[Cattaro]], was a part of a force of three U-boats intended to intercept British and Italian ships responding to the attacks; the other two were the Austro-Hungarian {{SMS|U-4|Austria-Hungary|2|sub=y}} (which was posted near Valona) and the German {{SMS|UC-25||2|sub=y}} (assigned to mine Brindisi). A squadron of British cruisers and Italian and French destroyers joined the battle against the Austro-Hungarian cruisers on 15 May. Several ships on each side were damaged by the time the engagement was broken off. As a result of the attacks the drifter line of the Barrage was moved farther south and maintained only during the day, a success for the [[Central Powers]]. ''U-27'' did not take any offensive action during the raid and ensuing battle.<ref name=Gib-254 />
