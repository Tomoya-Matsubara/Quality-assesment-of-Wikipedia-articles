==Mesoamerican Long Count calendar==
{{Main|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

December 2012 marks the conclusion of a ''[[b'ak'tun]]''<U+2014>a time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar which was used in [[Mesoamerica|Central America]] prior to the arrival of Europeans. Though the Long Count was most likely invented by the [[Olmec]],<ref>[[#deLara2006|de Lara and Justeson 2006]]</ref> it has become closely associated with the [[Maya civilization]], whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900&nbsp;AD.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Population structure of the classic period Maya|author=Andrew K.

Unlike the 52-year [[Calendar Round]] still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a ''uinal'', 18 uinals (360 days) made a ''tun'', 20 tuns made a ''k'atun'', and 20 k'atuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a ''b'ak'tun''. Thus, the Mayan date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b'ak'tuns, 3 k'atuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.<ref>[[#Schele1990|Schele and Freidel 1990]] 246</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/M-32.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Astronomical Insignificance of Maya Date 13.0.0.0.0|author=Vincent H.

In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that "the completion of a Great Period of 13 b'ak'tuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya".<ref>[[#Makemson1957|Makemson 1957]] 4</ref> In 1966, [[Michael D.

The present-day Maya, as a whole, do not attach much significance to b'ak'tun 13.<ref name=mormon/> Although the Calendar Round is still used by some Maya groups in the [[Guatemalan Highlands]], the Long Count was employed exclusively by the classic Maya, and was only rediscovered with the decipherment of the Mayan writing system in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Q & A about 2012|date=October 11, 2009|work=Maya Decipherment|author=David Stuart|url=http://decipherment.wordpress.com/2009/10/11/q-a-about-2012/|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref> Mayan elder Apolinario Chile Pixtun and Mexican archaeologist Guillermo Bernal both note that "apocalypse" is a Western concept that has little or nothing to do with Mayan beliefs.

It is not certain what significance the classic Maya give to the 13th b'ak'tun.<ref name=Houston1996/> Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations.<ref name=Houston1996>{{Cite journal|author=Stephen Houston |authorlink=Stephen D.

===Tortuguero===
The [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] site, which lies in southernmost [[Tabasco]], Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler ''Bahlam Ajaw''. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b'ak'tun 13. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation:

[[File:Bolon Yokte' K'uh.jpg|thumb|right|The Tortuguero monument connects the end of the 13th b'ak'tun with the appearance of Bolon Yokte' K'uh, shown here on the Vase of Seven Gods.|alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress.]]
Very little is known about the god Bolon Yokte'. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in ''British Anthropological Reports'', his name is composed of the elements "nine", 'OK-te' (the meaning of which is unknown), and "god". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes.<ref>[[#Eberl2005|Eberl and Prager 2005]] 28</ref> He also appears in inscriptions from [[Palenque]], [[Usumacinta]], and [[La Mar]] as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one [[Maya stelae|stele]] he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years.<ref>[[#Eberl2005|Eberl and Prager 2005]] 29<U+2013>30, citing Hieroglyphic Stairway E7-H12 at Palenque, plate 104 in Karl Herbert Mayer, ''Maya Monuments: Sculptures of Unknown Provenance, Supplement 4'' [in which the Sajal Niil is depicted in his costume], and Stele 1 from La Mar.</ref> 

Based on observations of modern Mayan rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stele refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte' K'uh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site.<ref>[[#GronemeyerMacLeod2010|Gronemeyer and MacLeod 2010]] 11, 36-37</ref> They note that the association of Bolon Yokte' K'uh with b'ak'tun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations, such as "erection of stelae, scattering of incense" and so forth. They furthermore assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012, and not the 7th century.<ref>[[#GronemeyerMacLeod2010|Gronemeyer and MacLeod 2010]] 24, 35</ref>

===Dates beyond b'ak'tun 13===

Mayan inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. Most of these are in the form of "distance dates": Long Count dates given together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added together make a future date. On the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year Calendar Round from the coronation of the ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615 AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (March 24, {{nowrap|603 AD Gregorian}}) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it,<ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93<U+2013>95">[[#Schele1992|Schele 1992]] 93<U+2013>95</ref> arriving at a date of October 21, 4772 AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time.<ref name="van"/><ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93<U+2013>95"/><ref>[[#Schele1990|Schele and Freidel 1990]] 430</ref>

Another example is Stele 1 at [[Coba]], which gives a date of {{nowrap|13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0}}, or twenty units above the b'ak'tun, placing it either 4.134105 <U+00D7> 10<sup>28</sup> (41 [[octillion]]) years in the future,<ref name="S&F"/> or an equal distance in the past.<ref>[[#Aveni2009|Aveni 2009]] 49</ref> This date is 3 [[quintillion]] times the [[age of the universe]] as determined by cosmologists.

==New Age beliefs==
Many assertions about the year 2012 form part of a non-codified collection of [[New Age]] beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. [[archaeoastronomy|Archaeoastronomer]] [[Anthony Aveni]] says that while the idea of "balancing the cosmos" was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon does not draw from those traditions. Instead, it is bound up with American concepts such as the [[New Age]] movement, [[millenarianism]], and the belief in [[secret knowledge]] from distant times and places.<ref>[[#Aveni2009|Aveni 2009]] 32<U+2013>33, 156<U+2013>157</ref> Established themes found in 2012 literature include "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture," the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature is not to warn of impending doom but "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism".<ref name="skepsis"/>  Aveni, who has studied New Age and [[SETI]] communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a "disconnected" society: "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time<U+2014>entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge."<ref>[[#Aveni2009|Aveni 2009]] 161</ref>

In 1975, the ending of b'ak'tun 13 became the subject of speculation by several [[New Age]] authors, who believe it will correspond to a global "consciousness shift". In his book ''Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness'', [[Frank Waters]] tied Coe's original date of December 24, 2011,{{ref label|D|d|d}} to astrology and the prophecies of the [[Hopi]],<ref>See in particular, chapter 6 ("The Great Cycle: Its Projected Beginning"), chapter 7 ("The Great Cycle&nbsp;<U+2013> Its Projected End") and the Appendix, in [[#Waters1975|Waters 1975]] 256<U+2013>264, 265<U+2013>271, 285</ref>  while both [[Jos<U+00E9> Arg<U+00FC>elles]] (in ''The Transformative Vision'')<ref>[[#Arg<U+00FC>elles1975|Arg<U+00FC>elles 1975]]</ref> and [[Terence McKenna]] (in ''The Invisible Landscape'')<ref name="ReferenceA">[[#McKenna1975|McKenna and McKenna 1975]]</ref><ref>(the more specific date of December 21 appeared in the 1993 revision of ''The Invisible Landscape'')([[#McKenna1993|McKenna&amp;McKenna 1993]])</ref> discussed the significance of the year 2012, but not a specific day. In 1987, the year in which he held the [[Harmonic Convergence]] event, Arg<U+00FC>elles settled on the date of December 21 in his book ''The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology'',<ref>{{cite news|title=Planets Won't Attend Astronomical Celebration|author= Philip J.

===Galactic alignment===
There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date.<ref>[[#Aveni2009|Aveni 2009]] 83</ref> However, since the mid 1990s, [[esoteric]] author [[John Major Jenkins]] has asserted that the ancient Maya intended to tie the end of their calendar to the winter [[solstice]] in 2012, which falls on December 21. This date was in line with an idea he terms the ''galactic alignment''.<ref name=jenk>{{Cite web|title=Introduction to Maya Cosmogenesis|author=John Major Jenkins|url=http://alignment2012.com/mc-intro.html|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>

====Precession====
In the [[Solar System]], the planets and the [[Sun]] lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the [[plane of the ecliptic]]. From our perspective on [[Earth]], the [[ecliptic]] is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve [[constellation]]s which line the ecliptic are known as the [[zodiac]] and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called "[[Precession of the equinoxes|precession]]", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a [[spinning top]] wobbles as it slows down.<ref name=prec>{{Cite web|title=Precession|publisher=NASA|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sprecess.htm|accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a [[Great Year]], the Sun completes a full, 360-degree backward circuit through the zodiac.<ref name=prec/> In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the [[northern hemisphere]]'s [[spring equinox]], or the point at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. Presently, the Sun's spring equinox position is in the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and is moving back into [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]]. This signals the end of one [[astrological age]] (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the [[Age of Aquarius]]).<ref>[[#Spencer2000|Spencer, 2000]], pp. 115<U+2013>27</ref>

Similarly, the Sun's [[winter solstice]] position, its lowest point, is currently in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]]; one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the [[Milky Way]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Teapot of Sagittarius points to galactic center|work=EarthSky|url=http://www.earthsky.org/tonightpost/favorite-star-patterns/teapot-of-sagittarius-points-to-galactic-center|author=Bruce McClure|accessdate=2009-11-03}}</ref> Every year, on the winter solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, from the surface of the Earth, appear to come into alignment, and every year, precession causes a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10<U+00B0> and 20<U+00B0> wide, it takes between  between 700 and 1400 years for the Sun's winter solstice position to precess through it.<ref>{{cite web|title=What's going to happen on December 21st 2012?|publisher=Cornell University|year=2006|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=686|accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref> It is currently about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the [[galactic equator]].<ref name=starry/>

Jenkins suggests that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the [[Great Rift (astronomy)|Great Rift]] or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which the Maya called the ''Xibalba be'' or "Black Road."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/stross/papers/xibalba.rtf|title=Xibalba or Xibalbe |author=Brian Stross |publisher=University of Texas |accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology.<ref name="Jenkins2012"/> According to Jenkins's hypothesis, precession will align the Sun precisely with the [[galactic equator]] at the 2012 winter solstice.<ref name="Jenkins2012">{{Cite web|url=http://alignment2012.com/whatisga.htm|title=What is the Galactic Alignment?|name=John Major Jenkins|publisher=alignment2012.com|accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref> Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Mayan Calendar and the Transformation of Consciousness|author=John Major Jenkins|publisher=alignement2012.com|url=http://alignment2012.com/mayancalendarbasics.htm|year=2005|accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argue that, just as [[astrology]] uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Mayans plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events.<ref>For an in-depth look at this subject, see [[#Coe1992|Coe 1992]], [[#Miller1993|Miller 1993]], [[#Pinchbeck2006|Pinchbeck 2006]]</ref> Jenkins attributes the insights of ancient Maya [[shamans]] about the [[galactic center]] to their use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]], [[psychoactive toad]]s, and other [[psychedelics]].<ref>[[#Jenkins1998|Jenkins 1998]] 191<U+2013>206</ref> Jenkins also associates the ''Xibalba be'' with a "world tree", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology.<ref>[[#Aveni2009|Aveni 2009]] 62</ref>

====Criticism====
Astronomers such as [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]] argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line, and can never be precisely drawn because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claims he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above {{convert|11000|ft|m}}, an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than Mayans had access to.<ref name=scare/> Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, it requires 36 years for it to precess across any single point. Jenkins himself notes that even given this determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The True Alignment Zone|author=John Major Jenkins|year=1999|month=June|url=http://edj.net/mc2012/truezone.htm|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref><ref>[[#Meeus1997|Meeus 1997]] 301<U+2013>303</ref>

There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni,<ref>[[#Jenkins2009|Jenkins 2009]] 215</ref> have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided.<ref name="van"/> There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes.<ref name="van"/><ref name="Aimers, J.

===Timewave zero and the ''I Ching''===
[[Image:Timewave 9 11 2001.png|thumb|A screenshot of the ''Timewave Zero'' software|alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation]]
"Timewave zero" is a [[numerology|numerological]] formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of "novelty", defined as increase over time in the [[universe]]'s interconnectedness, or [[Complexity#Disorganized complexity vs. organized complexity|organized complexity]].<ref name=TMobAB /> According to [[Terence McKenna]] the universe has a [[teleological]] attractor at the [[Ultimate fate of the universe|end of time]] that increases interconnectedness, eventually reaching a [[technological singularity|singularity]] of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable will occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s while using [[psilocybin mushrooms]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]].<ref name=TMobAB>{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/TerenceMckennaWithArtBell|title=Terence McKenna with Art Bell|author=Art Bell|date=May 22, 1997|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref>

McKenna expressed "novelty" in a computer program which purportedly produces a waveform known as ''timewave zero'' or the ''timewave''. Based on McKenna's interpretation of the [[King Wen sequence]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'',<ref name="ReferenceA"/> the graph appears to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's [[evolution|biological]] and [[sociocultural evolution|sociocultural]] evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are [[recursion|recursively]] related to the events of other times, and chose the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]] as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012. When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13<sup>th</sup> b'ak'tun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Ralph Abraham and Terence McKenna|url=http://www.ralph-abraham.org/talks/transcripts/hyperspace.html|title=Dynamics of Hyperspace|location=Santa Cruz, California|year=1983|publisher=Ralph Abraham|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>

The first edition of ''The Invisible Landscape'' refers to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. It was only in 1983, with the publication of Sharer's revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's ''The Ancient Maya,'' that each became convinced that December 21, 2012, had significant meaning. McKenna subsequently included this specific date throughout the second edition of ''The Invisible Landscape,'' published in 1993.<ref name="skepsis"/>

In 2006, author [[Daniel Pinchbeck]] popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book ''2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl'', linking b'ak'tun 13 to beliefs in [[crop circles]], [[alien abduction]], and personal revelations based on the use of [[entheogens]] and [[mediumship]].<ref name="Pinchbeck 2006">[[#Pinchbeck2006|Pinchbeck 2006]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/imperialcity/21697/|title=The End of the World As They Know It|author=Kurt Andersen|work=New York Magazine|year=2006|accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> Pinchbeck claims to discern a "growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date ...

[[Frank Joseph]]'s ''Atlantis and 2012: The Science of the Lost Civilization and the Prophecies of the Maya'', published in 2010, links supposed Maya prophecies about December 21, 2012 to mythology about the lost continents of [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], claiming that knowledge of a past cataclysm was carried to the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and to ancient [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]].  Joseph connects this knowledge to stories of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which he claims was stolen from the [[Great Pyramid]] by [[Moses]], brought from [[Jerusalem]] to the Americas by the [[Knights Templar]], and now lies hidden in a cave in [[Illinois]], awaiting its prophesied discovery in 2012, which is to usher in a New Age.<ref>[[#Joseph2010|Joseph 2010]]</ref>

Beginning in 2000, the small French village of [[Bugarach]], population 189, began receiving visits from "esoterics"<U+2014>mystic believers who have concluded that the local mountain, [[Pic de Bugarach]], is the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012.

A far more apocalyptic view of the year 2012 that has spread in various media describes the end of the world or of human civilization on that date. This view has been promulgated by many hoax pages on the Internet, particularly on [[YouTube]].<ref name=foratv/> The [[History Channel]] has aired a handful of special series on doomsday that include analysis of 2012 theories, such as ''[[Decoding the Past]]'' (2005<U+2013>2007), ''2012, End of Days'' (2006), ''[[Last Days on Earth]]'' (2006), ''Seven Signs of the Apocalypse'' (2007), and ''Nostradamus 2012'' (2008).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisites/armageddon|title=Armageddon series|year=2008|publisher=The History Channel|accessdate=2009-05-01}}</ref> The [[Discovery Channel]] also aired ''2012 Apocalypse'' in 2009, suggesting that massive [[Geomagnetic storm|solar storm]]s, [[magnetic pole reversal]], earthquakes, [[supervolcano]]es, and other drastic natural events may occur in 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-schedules/special.html?paid=1.403.26090.0.0|title=2012 Apocalypse|year=2009|publisher=The Discovery Channel|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref> Author [[Graham Hancock]], in  his book ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'', interpreted Coe's remarks in ''Breaking the Maya Code''<ref>[[#Coe1992|Coe 1992]] 275<U+2013>276.</ref> as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm.<ref>[[#Hancock 1995|Hancock 1995]] 499, ff. 27.</ref>

===Other alignments===
Some people have interpreted [[#Galactic alignment|Jenkins's hypothesis]] apocalyptically, claiming that when the galactic alignment occurs, it will somehow create a combined [[gravitation]]al effect between the Sun and the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of our galaxy (known as [[Sagittarius A*]]), thus creating havoc on Earth.<ref name=krupp>{{Cite web|title=The Great 2012 Scare|work=Sky and Telescope|url=http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documents/Doomsday2012-lores.pdf|author=[[Ed Krupp|E.

However, Jenkins has complained of the fact that a [[science fiction]] writer co-authored the documentary, and went on to characterize it as "45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".<ref>{{Cite web|author=John Major Jenkins|url=http://alignment2012.com/historychannel.html|title=How Not to Make a 2012 Documentary|date=July 28, 2006|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref>

Some believers in a 2012 doomsday have used the term "galactic alignment" to describe a very different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in [[mass extinction]]s supposedly observed in the [[fossil record]].<ref name=fraser>{{Cite web|title=Questions Show: Alignment with the Galactic Plane, Destruction from Venus, and the Death of the Solar System|work=Astronomy Cast|work=Universe Today|date=October 10, 2008|url= http://www.astronomycast.com/listeners/questions-shows/questions-show-alignment-with-the-galactic-plane-destruction-from-venus-and-the-death-of-the-solar-system/|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref> According to [[Shiva Hypothesis|this hypothesis]], mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it suggests that vertical oscillations made by the Sun as it orbits the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the [[galactic plane]]. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the [[galactic disc]], the influence of the [[galactic tide]] is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc<U+2014>as it does every 20<U+2013>25&nbsp;million years<U+2014>it comes under the influence of the far stronger "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of [[Oort cloud]] comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Perturbing the Oort Cloud|author=Michael Szpir|work=American Scientist|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/perturbing-the-oort-cloud|accessdate=2008-03-25|publisher=The Scientific Research Society}}</ref> However, this "alignment" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date.<ref>{{Cite web|author=[[Fraser Cain]]|title=Galactic Plane|work=Universe Today|url=http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/galaxies/galactic-plane/| date=May 11, 2009| accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref> Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc only three million years ago, and is now moving farther above it.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Sun's motion perpendicular to the galactic plane|author=John N.

A third suggested alignment is some sort of planetary [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] occurring on December 21, 2012. However, there will be no alignment of planets on that date.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nibiru and Doomsday 2012: Questions and Answers|url=http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/intro/nibiru-and-doomsday-2012-questions-and-answers|publisher=NASA: Ask an Astrobiologist|author=David Morrison|year=2010|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref> Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Planetary Alignment|author=Abby Cessna|work=Universe Today|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/34076/planetary-alignment/|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref> [[Jupiter]] is the [[List of Solar System objects by size#Objects_above_.7E200.C2.A0km_in_radius|largest]] planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined.

===Geomagnetic reversal===
Another idea tied to 2012 involves a [[geomagnetic reversal]] (often incorrectly referred to as a [[pole shift]] by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive [[solar flare]], that would release an energy equal to 100 billion [[atomic bombs]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=2012: No Killer Solar Flare|url=http://www.universetoday.com/14645/2012-no-killer-solar-flare/ 2012: No Killer Solar Flare|work=Universe Today|author=Ian O'Neill|date=June 21, 2008|accessdate=2009-10-14}}</ref> This belief is supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's [[magnetic field]] is weakening,<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Nils Olsen and Mioara Mandea|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v1/n6/abs/ngeo203.html|title=Rapidly changing flows in the Earth's core|publisher=Nature Geocscience|date= 18 May 2008|volume=1|pages= 390<U+2013>394|doi=10.1038/ngeo203}}</ref> which could precede a reversal of the north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic pole]]s.

===Planet X/Nibiru===
{{Main|Nibiru collision}}
Some proponents of doomsday in 2012 claim that a planet called Planet&nbsp;X, or Nibiru, will collide with or pass by Earth in that year. This idea has appeared in various forms since 1995, and originally predicted the event in 2003, but this date was abandoned after it passed without incident.<ref name=morrison/> The idea originated from claims of [[Mediumship|channeling]] of alien beings and has been widely ridiculed.<ref name=morrison>{{Cite web|title=The Myth of Nibiru and the End of the World in 2012|author=David Morrison|publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=October 2008|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/myth_of_nibiru_and_the_end_of_the_world_in_2012/|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref><ref name=schill>[[#Schilling2008|Schilling 2008]] 111</ref> Astronomers have calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.<ref name=morrison/>

Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 have included predictions by the [[Web Bot]] project, a computer program that purports to predict the future using Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected the programmers' claims to have successfully predicted natural disasters, which web chatter could never predict, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/6227357/Web-bot-project-makes-prophecy-of-2012-apocalypse.html|title='Web-bot project' makes prophecy of 2012 apocalypse|last=Chivers|first=Tom|date=24 September 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=2009-10-04 | location=London}}</ref> Also, the 2012 date has been loosely tied to the long-running concept of the [[Photon Belt]], which predicts a form of interaction between Earth and [[Alcyone (star)|Alcyone]], the largest star of the [[Pleiades cluster]].<ref name=morris2/> Critics have argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, is in fact moving farther away from them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_042.html|title= Is the earth about to enter the Photon Belt, causing the end of life as we know it?|work=The Straight Dope|year=1996|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref> 

Some media outlets have tied the possibility that the [[red supergiant]] star [[Betelgeuse]] may undergo a [[supernova]] at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse is certainly in the final stages of its life, and will die as a supernova, there is no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betelgeuse and 2012|author=Phil Plait|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/01/21/betelgeuse-and-2012/|work=Bad Astronomy|year=2011|accessdate=2011-05-01}}</ref> To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be as close as 25 light years to the Solar System.

The 2009 disaster film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a [[stealth marketing]] campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional "Institute for Human Continuity" called on people to prepare for the end of the world.

==Notes==

*{{note label|A|a|a}} The number 13 plays an important role in Mesoamerican calendrics; the ''[[tzolk'in]]'', or sacred calendar, was divided into 13 months of 20 days each. The Mayan ''may'' cycle consisted of 13 k'atuns. The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested.<ref>[[#Rice2007|Rice, 2007]] 44, 59</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Origin of the 260-day calendar: the gestation hypothesis reconsidered in light of its use among the Quiche Maya|author=Duncan McLean Earl and Dean R Snow|publisher=State University of New York at Albany|url=http://archeometrie.perso.neuf.fr/260%20Day%20Calendar.pdf|accessdate=2011-03-20}}</ref>
*{{note label|B|b|b}} The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero.<ref name=joyce/>
*{{Note label|C|c|c}} Most Mayanist scholars, such as [[Mark Van Stone]] and [[Anthony Aveni]], adhere to the "GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114 BC and the end date of b'ak'tun 13 at December 21, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who's Who in the Maya World|publisher=famsi.org|url=http://research.famsi.org/whos_who/christian_dates.htm|author=Peter Matthews|accessdate=2011-04-13}}</ref> This date is also the overwhelming preference of those who believe in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it falls on a [[solstice]], and is thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as [[Michael D Coe]], [[Linda Schele]] and [[Marc Zender]], adhere to the "Lounsbury/GMT+2" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August  and the end date at December 23. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Questions and comments|author=Mark Van Stone|publisher=FAMSI|url= http://www.famsi.org/research/vanstone/2012/comments.html|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref> 
*{{Note label|D|d|d}} Coe's initial date was "December 24, 2011." He revised it to "11 January AD 2013" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book,<ref>[[#Coe1980|Coe 1980]] 151</ref> not settling on December 23, 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition.<ref>[[#Coe1984|Coe 1984]]. This correlation, which differs two days from Sharer's, is repeated in subsequent editions of Coe's book</ref> The correlation of 13.0.0.0.0 as 21&nbsp;December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of [[Robert J. Sharer]]'s 1983 revision of the 4th edition of [[Sylvanus Morley]]'s book ''The Ancient Maya''.<ref>[[#Morley1983|Morley 1983]] 603, Table B2</ref>
