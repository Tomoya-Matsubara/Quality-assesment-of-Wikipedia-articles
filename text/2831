'''''Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima''''' is an<!-- Per [[WP:ENGVAR]], as an article about a subject relating mostly to the United States, American English should be used. --> historic [[photograph]] taken on February 23, 1945, by [[Joe Rosenthal]]. It depicts five [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] and a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Hospital Corpsman|corpsman]] raising the [[flag of the United States]] atop [[Mount Suribachi]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]].

The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]] in the same year as its publication, and came to be regarded in the United States as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.<ref name="ap">{{cite news|accessdate=

Of the six men depicted in the picture, three ([[Franklin Sousley]], [[Harlon Block]], and [[Michael Strank]]) were killed during the battle; the three survivors ([[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]], [[Rene Gagnon]], and [[Ira Hayes]]) became celebrities upon their identification in the photo. The picture was later used by [[Felix de Weldon]] to sculpt the [[USMC War Memorial]], located adjacent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] just outside [[Washington, D.C.]]

==Background==
{{Main|Battle of Iwo Jima}}

[[File:Iwo-to landsat1999.jpg|thumb|The island of Iwo Jima. Mount Suribachi is located on the southern tip.]]
On February 19, 1945, as part of their [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island-hopping]] [[strategy]] to defeat [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the [[United States]] invaded [[Iwo Jima]]. Iwo Jima was originally not a target, but the relatively quick [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|fall of the Philippines]] left the Americans with a longer-than-expected lull prior to the planned [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. Iwo Jima is located half-way between Japan and the [[Mariana Islands]], where American long-range bombers were based, and was used by the Japanese as an [[Ground-controlled interception|early warning station]], [[radio]]ing warnings of incoming American bombers to the Japanese homeland. The Americans, after capturing the island, deprived the Japanese of their early warning system, and used it as an [[emergency landing]] strip for damaged bombers, saving many American lives.<ref name=Weinberg>{{cite book

Iwo Jima is a [[volcanism|volcanic]] island, shaped like a [[trapezoid]]. Marines on the island described it as "a gray [[pork chop]]". The island was heavily fortified, and the invading United States Marines suffered high casualties. The island is dominated by [[Mount Suribachi]], a {{convert|546|ft|m|adj=on}} [[dormant volcano|dormant]] [[volcanic cone]] situated on the southern tip of the island. Politically, the island is part of the [[prefecture]] of [[Tokyo]]. It would be the first Japanese homeland soil to be captured by the Americans, and it was a matter of honor for the Japanese to prevent its capture.
[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|left|[[Mount Suribachi]] is the dominant geographical feature of [[Iwo Jima]].]]
Tactically, the top of Suribachi is one of the most important locations on the island. From that vantage point, the Japanese defenders were able to accurately [[Field artillery#FO (Forward Observer)|spot artillery]] onto the Americans - particularly the landing beaches. The Japanese fought most of the battle from underground [[bunker]]s and [[Bunker#Pillbox|pillboxes]]. It was not uncommon for Marines to knock out one pillbox using [[grenade]]s or a [[flamethrower]], only to have it begin shooting again a few minutes later after more Japanese infantry slipped into the pillbox using a tunnel. The American effort concentrated on isolating and capturing Suribachi first, a goal that was achieved on February 23, 1945, four days after the battle began. Despite capturing Suribachi, the battle continued to rage for many days, and the island would not be declared "secure" until 31 days later, on March 26.

The famous picture taken by Rosenthal actually captured the second flag-raising event of the day. A U.S. flag was first raised atop Suribachi soon after it was captured early in the morning (around 10:20) of February 23, 1945. [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Dave E. Severance]] was ordered by 2nd Battalion Commander Chandler Johnson to send a platoon to go take the mountain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bradley| first = James| authorlink = James Bradley (author)| title = ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''|pages=306. | year = 2006| publisher = Bantam; Reissue edition| isbn= 0553384155}}</ref> Severance, the commander of Easy Company ([[2nd Battalion, 28th Marines]], [[5th Marine Division]]), ordered [[First Lieutenant]] [[Harold G.

Their boat touched the beach just after the flag went up, and the mood among the high command turned jubilant. Gazing upward, at the red, white, and blue speck, Forrestal remarked to Smith: "Holland, the raising of that flag on Suribachi means a Marine Corps for the next five hundred years."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Forrestal was so taken with fervor of the moment that he decided he wanted the Suribachi flag as a souvenir. The news of this wish did not sit well with [[2nd Battalion 3rd Marines|2nd Battalion]] Commander Chandler Johnson, whose temperament was every bit as fiery as Howlin Mad's. 'To hell with that!' the colonel spat when the message reached him. The flag belonged to the battalion, as far as Johnson was concerned.

The roar of the Marines on the islands and ship horns blasting away alerted the Japanese who up to this point had stayed in their cave bunkers.

On orders from [[Colonel]] Chandler Johnson, passed on by Captain Severance, Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon H. Block, Private First Class Franklin R. Sousley and Private First Class Ira H. Hayes spent the morning of the 23rd laying a [[telephone]] wire to the top of Suribachi. Severance also dispatched Private First Class Rene A. Gagnon, a runner, to the command post for fresh [[SCR-300]] walkie-talkie batteries.

Meanwhile, according to the official Marine Corps history, Tuttle had found a larger (96-by-56&nbsp;inch) flag in nearby [[Tank landing ship|Tank Landing Ship]] LST 779, made his way back to the command post, and given it to Johnson. Johnson, in turn, gave it to Gagnon with orders to take it back up Suribachi and raise it.<ref>[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', p. 210.</ref> The official Marine Corps history of the event is that Tuttle received the flag from Ensign Alan Wood of LST 779, who in turn had received the flag from a supply depot in [[Pearl Harbor]]. However, the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Historian's Office supports claims made by Robert Resnick, who served aboard LST 758. "Before he died in November 2004, Resnick said Gagnon came aboard LST-758 the morning of February 23 looking for a flag. Resnick said he grabbed one from a bunting box and asked permission from commanding officer Lt. Felix Molenda to donate it. Resnick kept quiet about his participation until 2001."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armytimes.com/story.php?f=1-292308-1408901.php |title=Iwo Jima flag legend puts services at odds |publisher=Armytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> The flag itself was sewn by Mabel Sauvageau, a worker at the "flag loft" of the [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]].<ref>Fame Eludes Creator Of Iwo Jima banner.

The Marines reached the top of the mountain around noon, where Gagnon joined them. Despite the large numbers of Japanese troops in the immediate vicinity, the 40-man patrol made it to the top of the mountain without being fired on once, as the Japanese were under bombardment at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq87-3l.htm |title=U.S. Naval Historical Center <U+2014> Recollections of the flag raising on Mount Suribachi by John Bradley |publisher=History.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref>

Rosenthal, along with Marine photographers [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]] and [[William Genaust|Bill Genaust]] (who was killed in action nine days after the flag raising)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ca4/gunnyg/themanweleftbehind.html |title=The Man We Left Behind <U+2014> Sgt Bill Genaust USMC-Iwo Jima 1945 |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> was climbing Suribachi at this time. On the way up, the trio met Lowery (the man who photographed the first flag raising). They had been considering turning around, but Lowery told them that the summit was an excellent vantage point from which to take pictures.<ref name="MarineCrops"/>

Rosenthal's trio reached the summit as the Marines were attaching the flag to an old Japanese water pipe. Rosenthal put down his [[Speed Graphic]] camera (which was set to 1/400th of a second [[shutter speed]], with the [[f-stop]] between 8 and 16) on the ground so he could pile rocks to stand on for a better vantage point. In doing so, he nearly missed the shot. Along with Navy Pharmacist's Mate Second Class John H. Bradley, the five Marines began raising the U. S. flag. Realizing he was about to miss it, Rosenthal quickly swung his camera up and snapped the photograph without using the [[viewfinder]].<ref name = "bradley209<U+2013>11">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', p. 209<U+2013>211.</ref> Ten years after the flag-raising, Rosenthal wrote:<blockquote>Out of the corner of my eye, I had seen the men start the flag up. I swung my camera and shot the scene. That is how the picture was taken, and when you take a picture like that, you don't come away saying you got a great shot. You don't know.</blockquote>

Bill Genaust, who was standing almost shoulder-to-shoulder with Rosenthal about thirty yards from the flag raising, was shooting motion-picture film during the flag-raising. His film captures the flag raising at an almost-identical angle to Rosenthal's famous shot.

Of the six men pictured <U+2014> [[Michael Strank]], [[Rene Gagnon]], [[Ira Hayes]], [[Franklin Sousley]], [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]], and [[Harlon Block]] <U+2014> only three (Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley) survived the battle. Strank was killed six days after the flag raising when a shell, likely fired from an offshore American destroyer, tore his heart out; Block was killed by a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] a few hours after Strank; Sousley &mdash; the last of the flag-raisers to succumb in the battle <U+2014> was shot and killed by a sniper on March 21, a few days before the island was declared secure.<ref name="Arlington">{{cite web|accessdate=

==Publication and staging controversy==

Following the flag raising, Rosenthal sent his film to [[Guam]] to be developed and printed.<ref name = "Many Things">[http://www.manythings.org/voa/03/030811ta_t.htm This Is America <U+2014> The Iwo Jima Statue]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> George Tjaden of [[Hendricks, Minnesota|Hendricks]], [[Minnesota]], was likely the technician who printed it.<ref name="Keloland">[http://www.keloland.com/News/NewsDetail5444.cfm?Id=0,43877 Hemmingsen: A Developing Story]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref> Upon seeing it, [[Associated Press|AP]] photo editor John Bodkin exclaimed "Here's one for all time!" and immediately [[radiofax|radiophotoed]] the image to the AP headquarters in [[New York]] at 7:00 a.m., [[Eastern War Time]].<ref name="bradley220">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', p. 220.</ref> The photograph was picked up off the wire very quickly by hundreds of newspapers.

However, the photo was not without controversy. Following the second flag raising, Rosenthal had the Marines of Easy Company pose for a group shot, the "[[gung-ho]]" shot.<ref name = "Rosenthal">Rosenthal, Joe. [http://www.iwojima.com/raising/l721flag.gif Posed "gung-ho" shot]. February 23, 1945.</ref> This was also documented by Bill Genaust.<ref name = "Genaust">Genaust, Bill. [http://www.iwojima.com/raising/lflagj.gif Picture of Rosenthal taking the 'Gung-ho' shot]. February 23, 1945.</ref> A few days after the picture was taken, back on Guam, Rosenthal was asked if he had posed the photo. Thinking the questioner was referring to the 'gung-ho' picture, he replied "Sure." After that, [[Robert Sherrod]], a ''[[Time-Life]]'' correspondent, told his editors in New York that Rosenthal had staged the flag-raising photo. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s radio show, 'Time Views the News', broadcast a report, charging that "Rosenthal climbed Suribachi after the flag had already been planted... Like most photographers [he] could not resist reposing his characters in historic fashion."<ref name="ap"/>

As a result of this report, Rosenthal was repeatedly accused of staging the picture, or covering up the first flag raising. One ''New York Times'' book reviewer even went so far as to suggest revoking his Pulitzer Prize.<ref name="ap"/> For the decades that have followed, Rosenthal repeatedly and vociferously denied claims that the flag raising was staged. "I don't think it is in me to do much more of this sort of thing... I don't know how to get across to anybody what 50 years of constant repetition means."<ref name="ap"/> Genaust's film also shows the claim that the flag-raising was staged to be erroneous.

Upon seeing the photo, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] realized the picture would make an excellent symbol for the upcoming 7th [[war bond]] drive, and ordered the Marines identified and brought home. The Marines were brought home at the conclusion of the battle. Using a photo enlargement, Rene Gagnon identified the others in the photograph, but refused to identify the sixth man (Hayes), insisting he had promised to keep the man's name a secret.<ref name="History">{{cite web|author=Frederick C.

''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.268</ref> After being brought to Marine Corps headquarters and informed that he was being ordered by the President to reveal the information, and that refusing an order to reveal the name would be a serious crime, Gagnon finally revealed Hayes's name.

Gagnon also misidentified Harlon Block as Sergeant [[Hank Hansen|Henry O. "Hank" Hansen]], who had not survived the battle (but who had, incidentally, participated in the first flag raising). Initially, John Bradley concurred with all of Gagnon's identifications. On April 8, 1945, the Marine Corps released the identification of five of the flag raisers (including Hansen)&mdash;Sousley's identity was withheld pending notification of his family of his death during the battle.

The three survivors went on a whirlwind bond tour. The tour was a success, raising $26.3 billion, twice the tour's goal.<ref name="bradley294">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.294</ref>

[[File:Ira Hayes.jpg|thumbnail|upright|In late 1946, [[Ira Hayes]] broke his silence and revealed that [[Harlon Block]] had been misidentified as [[Hank Hansen]].]]

Questions lingered about the misidentification of Harlon Block. His mother, Belle Block, refused to accept the official identification, noting that she had "changed so many [[diaper]]s on that boy's butt, I know it's my boy."<ref name="lecture">[http://www.webb-institute.edu/Alumni/bradley_lecture.php James J. Bradley lecture at the Webb Institute]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}</ref> Immediately on arrival in [[Washington, D.C.]] on April 19, Hayes noticed the misidentification in the photo, and informed the Marine [[public relations]] officer who had been assigned to him. The public relations officer told Hayes that the identifications had already been officially released, and ordered Hayes to keep silent about it.<ref name="bradley275">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.275</ref>

Over a year and a half later, amidst the [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]] that would characterize the rest of his life following the war, Ira Hayes [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] to [[Texas]] to inform Block's family that Block had, in fact, been the sixth flag raiser.<ref name="bradley312">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.312</ref> <blockquote>Ira remembered what Rene Gagnon and John Bradley could not have remembered, because they did not join the little cluster until the last moment: that it was Harlon [Block], Mike [Strank], Franklin [Sousley] and himself [Hayes] who had ascended Suribachi midmorning to lay telephone wire; it was Rene [Gagnon] who had come along with the replacement flag. Hansen had not been part of this action.<ref name="bradley274">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.274</ref></blockquote>
Block's mother, Belle, immediately composed a letter to her [[United States Congress|congressional]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]] [[Milton West]]. West, in turn, forwarded the letter to [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Marine Corps Commandant]] [[Alexander Vandegrift]], who ordered an investigation.

Rosenthal's photo won the 1945 [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]], the only photograph to win the prize in the same year it was taken. Following publication of the photograph,<blockquote>News pros were not the only ones bedazzled by the photo. Navy Captain T.B. Clark was on duty at [[Naval Air Station Patuxent River|Patuxent Air Station]] in [[Maryland]] that Saturday when it came humming off the wire. He studied it for a minute, and then thrust it under the gaze of Navy [[Petty Officer]] [[Felix de Weldon]]. De Weldon was an Austrian immigrant schooled in European painting and sculpture. De Weldon could not take his eyes off the photo. In its classic [[triangular lines]] he recognized similarities with the ancient statues he had studied. He reflexively reached for some [[sculptor's clay]] and tools. With the photograph before him he labored through the night. By dawn, he had replicated the six boys pushing a pole, raising a flag.<ref name="bradley220"/></blockquote>

Starting in 1951, de Weldon was commissioned to design a memorial to the Marine Corps. It took de Weldon and hundreds of his assistants three years to finish it. The three survivors posed for de Weldon, who used their faces as a model. The other three who did not survive were sculpted from pictures.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=

Following the war, plagued with depression brought on by [[survivor guilt]], Hayes became an alcoholic. His tragic life was memorialized in the [[folk song]] "The Ballad of Ira Hayes", written by [[Peter LaFarge]] and recorded by [[Johnny Cash]] in 1964. [[Bob Dylan]] later [[cover version|covered]] the song, as did [[Kinky Friedman]]. According to the song, after the war,

<blockquote>
:Then Ira started drinkin' hard
:Jail was often his home
:They'd let him raise the flag and lower it

Likewise [[Rene Gagnon]]'s last years were bitter and alcoholic before his death in 1979 at 54.
Following the war, [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|Bradley]] was staunchly tight-lipped about his experiences, often deflecting questions by claiming he had forgotten.<ref name="bradley343">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', p. 343.</ref> During his 47-year marriage, he only talked about it with his wife Betty once, on their first date, and never again afterwards.<ref name="lecture"/> Within the family, it was considered a [[taboo]] subject. He gave exactly one interview, in 1985, at the urging of his wife, who had told him to do it for the sake of their grandchildren.<ref name="bradley352">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', p. 352.</ref> Following Bradley's death in 1994, his family went to Suribachi in 1997 and placed a plaque (made of [[Wisconsin]] [[granite]] and shaped like that state) on the spot where the flag raising took place.<ref>[http://jamesbradley.com/author.asp James Bradley Biography] - "The plaque marks the spot where the flag was raised."</ref> At the time of his death, Bradley's son, [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] knew almost nothing of his father's wartime experiences.<ref name="lecture"/> As a [[catharsis]], James Bradley spent four years interviewing the families of all the flag raisers, and published ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', a definitive book on the flag raising and its participants.<ref name="bradley5">[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', p. 5.</ref> This book inspired a [[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|2006 movie of the same name]], directed by [[Clint Eastwood]].

Rosenthal's photograph has been reproduced in a number of other formats. It appeared on 3.5 million posters for the 7th war bond drive.<ref name="ap"/>

The Iwo Jima flag raising has been depicted in other films including 1949's ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (in which the three surviving flag raisers make a [[cameo appearance]] at the end of the film) and 1961's ''[[The Outsider (1961 film)|The Outsider]]'', a biography of Ira Hayes starring [[Tony Curtis]].

In July 1945, the [[United States Postal Service]] released a [[postage stamp]] bearing the image.<ref name = "1847 USA">{{cite web|url=http://www.1847usa.com/identify/YearSets/1945.htm |title=1945 Iwo Jima Stamp |publisher=1847usa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080428184536/http://www.1847usa.com/identify/YearSets/1945.htm| archivedate = April 28, 2008}}</ref> The US issued another stamp in 1995 showing the flag raising as part of its 10-stamp series marking the 50th anniversary of World War II.<ref name = "USPS">{{cite web|url=http://www.usps.com/images/stamps/95/iwojima.gif |title=1995 Iwo Jima Stamp |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> In 2005, the [[United States Mint]] released a [[Marine Corps 230th Anniversary Silver Dollar|commemorative silver dollar]] bearing the image in this photograph.

A similar photograph was taken by [[Thomas E. Franklin]] of the ''[[The Record (Bergen County)|Bergen Record]]'' in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Officially known as "Ground Zero Spirit", the photograph is perhaps better known as "[[Raising the Flag at Ground Zero]]", and shows three [[firefighter]]s raising a U.S. flag in the ruins of the [[World Trade Center]] shortly after 5pm.<ref name = "Ground Zero">{{cite web|url=http://www.groundzerospirit.org/ |title=Official Bergen Record page on "Ground Zero Spirit" |publisher=Groundzerospirit.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref><ref name = "Sept Terror">{{cite web|url=http://septterror.tripod.com/firephoto.html |title=Story of the photo |publisher=Septterror.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> Painter [[Jamie Wyeth]] also painted a related image titled "September 11th" based on this scene. It illustrates rescue workers raising a flag at Ground Zero.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allposters.com/-sp/September-11th-Posters_i378938_.htm |title=Jamie Wyeth September 11th print |publisher=Allposters.com |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref> Other iconic photos frequently compared include ''[[V<U+2013>J day in Times Square]]'', ''[[Into the Jaws of Death]]'', ''[[Raising a flag over the Reichstag]]'', and the raising of the Israeli [[Ink Flag]].

The highly recognizable image has been parodied several times. [[Anti-war]] [[activism|activist]]s in the 1960s altered the flag to bear a [[peace symbols|peace symbol]], as well as several [[anti-establishment]] artworks.<ref name="parodies MCT">{{cite news|title=BASSA-ckward: British labor group alters iconic Marine image|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=March 15, 2010|publisher=[[Marine Corps Times]]|page=6|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref> [[Edward Kienholz]]'s ''Portable War Memorial'' in 1968 depicted faceless Marines raising the flag on an outdoor [[picnic table]] in a typical American [[consumerism|consumerist]] environment of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/K/kienholz/war_memorial.jpg.html |title=Keiholz: The Portable War Memorial |publisher=Artchive.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-traonline.org/past_articles.php?articleID=48 |title=Contemporary Art Quarterly |publisher=X-traonline.org |date=1996-05-06 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}</ref><ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n10_v84/ai_18749036 Scavenger's parade Art in America]{{dead link|date=March 2010}}</ref> It was parodied again during the [[Iran hostage crisis]] of 1979 to depict the flag being planted into Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]<U+2019>s behind.<ref name="parodies MCT"/> The logo of the [[NetBSD]] operating system from 1994 to 2004 was a parody of the photograph, and an altered version appeared on the cover of [[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'' in 2003. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] came under fire in 2008 after altering the image for use on its cover, replacing the American flag with a tree for an issue focused on [[global warming]].<ref name="parodies MCT"/> The [[British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association]] likewise came under criticism in 2010 for a poster depicting employees raising a flag marked "BASSA" at the edge of a runway.<ref name="parodies MCT"/>
