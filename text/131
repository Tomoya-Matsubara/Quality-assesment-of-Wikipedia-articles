'''Alice Ann Bailey''' (June 16, 1880&nbsp;<U+2013> December 15, 1949), known as '''Alice A. Bailey''' or '''AAB''' to her followers, was a writer and [[Theosophy|theosophist]] in what she termed "Ageless Wisdom".  This included [[occult]] teachings, "esoteric" psychology and healing, [[astrology|astrological]] and other philosophic and religious themes. Alice Bailey was born as '''Alice LaTrobe Bateman''', in [[Manchester]], England.<ref>''American Astrology'' Magazine, September 1937</ref> She moved to the United States in 1907, where she spent most of her life as a writer and teacher.

Her works, written between 1919 and 1949, describe a wide-ranging system of [[esotericism|esoteric]] thought covering such topics as how spirituality relates to the solar system, meditation, healing, spiritual psychology, the destiny of nations, and prescriptions for society in general. She described the majority of her work as having been [[telepathy|telepathically]] dictated to her by a Master of Wisdom, initially referred to only as "the Tibetan", or by the initials "D.K.", later identified as Djwal Khul.<ref name="Bailey, Alice 1951 p 1">Bailey, Alice A.

Her writings were influenced by the works of [[Madame Blavatsky]]. Though Bailey's writings differ from the orthodox Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky, they also have much in common with it. She wrote about religious themes, including [[Christianity]], though her writings are fundamentally different from many aspects of Christianity and of other orthodox religions. Her vision of a unified society includes a global "spirit of religion" different from traditional religious forms and including the concept of the [[Astrological age|Age of Aquarius]].<ref>{{cite book

Controversy has arisen around some of Bailey's statements on [[nationalism]], [[American isolationism]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet totalitarianism]], [[Fascism]], [[Zionism]], [[Nazism]], [[race relations]], Africans, Jews, and the religions of [[Judaism]] and Christianity.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
Alice Bailey was born to a wealthy aristocratic British family, and as a member of the [[Church of England|Anglican Church]], received a thorough Christian education. She described a lonely and "over-sheltered" childhood and was unhappy despite the luxury of her physical circumstances.<ref>{{cite book

In her autobiography she related that as a child she was unhappy and did not find life worth living, and because of this attempted suicide three times: the first at the age of five, the second at age 11, and the third at an unspecified time prior to age 15. She wrote that after her third attempt, she lost interest in the idea, but that she "always understood the impulse." <ref>{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Autobiography of Alice A. Bailey|last=Bailey|first=Alice A|publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1951 |page=21 |isbn=0-85330-024-0}}</ref>

At age 15, on June 30, 1895, Bailey was visited by a stranger, "...a tall man, dressed in European clothes and wearing a turban" who told her she needed to develop self-control to prepare for certain work planned for her to do.<ref name=Keller763>{{cite book |last=Keller |first=Rosemary Skinner |coauthors=Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon |title=Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2006 |page=763 |isbn=0-253-34688-6}}</ref> She supposed this individual was Jesus, but later she identified him as Master Koot Hoomi.<ref name=hammer65>{{cite book |last=Hammer |first=Olav |title=Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age |publisher=BRILL |year=2004 |page=65 |isbn=90-04-13638-X}}</ref>

Bailey's break was not only with her Christian husband, but with Christianity in general. In her autobiography she wrote that "a rabid, orthodox Christian worker [had] become a well-known occult teacher."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Autobiography of Alice A. Bailey|last=Bailey|first=Alice A|publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1951 |page=1 |isbn=0-85330-024-0}}</ref>

===With the Theosophical Society===
In 1915 Bailey discovered the [[Theosophical Society]] and the work of [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (Bailey, pp 134<U+2013>136). Theosophical Society states that Bailey became involved in 1917.<ref>Mills, Joy, ''100 Years of Theosophy, A History of the Theosophical Society in America,'' 1987, p. 62</ref> Theosophist Joy Mills states that in 1918 she became a member of the Esoteric Section of the society.<ref>Meade, Marion, ''Madame Blavatsky, the Woman Behind the Myth,'' [[Music Corporation of America|Putnam]], 1980, p. 468</ref> Theosophist Bruce F. Campbell notes, "She quickly rose to a position of influence in the American Section of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]] society, moving to its headquarters at Krotona in Hollywood. She became editor of its magazine, ''The Messenger,'' and member of the committee responsible for Krotona."<ref>Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1980, p. 151</ref>

Bailey claimed to recognize Koot Hoomi, the master who had visited her in her childhood, from a portrait she saw in the Shrine Room of the Theosophical Society. (Bailey, pp 156).<ref>Ross, Joseph E., ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, Vol. II'' Joseph Ross, 2004, p. 340</ref> Bailey wrote much about those she called the "Masters of the Ancient Wisdom", which she believed to be a brotherhood of enlightened sages working under the guidance of "Maitreya." In part, she stated her writings were an effort to clarify the nature of these Masters, and their work.<ref name=auto-1>{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Autobiography of Alice A. Bailey|last=Bailey|first=Alice A|publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1951 |pages=1 (introduction) |isbn=0-85330-024-0}}</ref>

==="The Tibetan", split from Theosophy, and second marriage===
Bailey wrote that, in 1919, she was contacted by a Master known as The Tibetan (later associated with the initials ''D.K.'', and eventually the name Djwhal Khul). Bailey stated that after initial resistance, she was eventually persuaded to write down the communications from this source. She wrote for 30 years, from 1919 to 1949.<ref name="Bailey, Alice 1951 p 1" /> The result was 24 published books on ancient wisdom, philosophy, religion, contemporary events, science, psychology, nations, astrology, and healing. Also in 1919, 32nd degree [[Freemason]] Foster Bailey (1888<U+2013>1977), who was to be her second husband, became National Secretary of the Theosophical Society. (Bailey, p.&nbsp;157)<ref name="York, Michael 1995 p. 63">York, Michael, ''The Emerging Network: A Sociology of the New Age and Neo-Pagan Movements,'' [[Rowman & Littlefield]], 1995, p. 63</ref> They married in 1921.<ref name=penn2>{{cite book |last=Penn |first=Lee |title=False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One World Religion |publisher=Sophia Perennis |year=2004 |page=20 |isbn=1-59731-000-X}}</ref>

The Theosophist published the first few chapters of her first work, ''Initiation, Human and Solar,'' but then stopped for reasons Bailey called "theosophical jealousy and reactionary attitude."<ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 151">Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement, [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1980, p. 151</ref> Bailey "objected to the 'neo-Theosophy' of Annie Besant" and worked with Foster Bailey to gain more power in the American Section.<ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 151" /> According to Theosophist [[Josephine Maria Davies Ransom]], she became part of a progressive "Back to Blavatsky movement, led mainly by Mr. and Mrs. Foster Bailey".<ref>Ransom, Josephine, ''A Short History of the Theosophical Society, Adyar, 1938, p. 452</ref> She outlined her vision for the Esoteric Section of the Theosophical Society and announced ideals of tolerance and brotherhood.<ref>"Bailey, Alice, ''A Vision of Krotona's Future,'' in ''The Messenger,'' p. 259</ref><ref>Ross, Joseph E., ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, Vol. II'' Joseph Ross, 2004, p. 410</ref> However, her efforts to influence the society failed, and she and her husband were dismissed from their positions.<ref>Ross, Joseph E., ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, Vol. II'' Joseph Ross, 2004, p. 346</ref>

According to historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]], Bailey's early writings of communications with the Tibetan were well received within the society, but society president [[Annie Besant]] questioned Bailey's claims of communications with "the Tibetan" and allowed the Baileys to be expelled from the organization.<ref name=hammer65/> According to Bailey, she had come to see the society as authoritarian and involved with "lower psychic phenomena.".<ref name=Keller763/> In her writings, however, she continued to acknowledge the importance of Madame Blavatsky's works, and saw her own task as the continuation and further development of Blavatsky's teachings. (Bailey, pp.&nbsp;168<U+2013>177)

===The Arcane School and the Lucis Trust===
{{Main|Lucis Trust}}
According to the Lucis Trust website, the Baileys founded a quarterly magazine of esoteric philosophy entitled ''The Beacon'' in 1922.<ref name=beacon>{{cite web|url=http://www1.lucistrust.org/beacon/|title=About the Beacon}}</ref>

In 1923, with the help of Foster Bailey, Alice Bailey also founded the Arcane School (also part of Lucis Trust), which gave (and still gives) a series of correspondence courses based on her heterodox version of Theosophy, which accepted the basic Theosophical views on ''karma'', reincarnation, masters, a divine plan, and humanity's achievement of their original divine status (Bailey, pp.&nbsp;192<U+2013>193).<ref name="York, Michael 1995 p. 63" />

The Lucis Trust website and Alice Bailey's autobiography also state that, together with Foster Bailey, she created the "World Goodwill" organization to promote what she called "Love in Action".<ref>[http://www.lucistrust.org/en/service_activities/world_goodwill__1 About World Goodwill], Lucis trust Website</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography.'' Lucis Trust. 1951. p 2</ref> The stated purposes of World Goodwill, according to its sponsoring organization, the Lucis Trust, are: "To help mobilise the energy of goodwill; To cooperate in the work of preparation for the reappearance of the Christ; To educate public opinion on the causes of the major world problems and to help create the thoughtform of solution."<ref>[http://www.lucistrust.org/en/service_activities/world_goodwill__1/purposes_objectives World Goodwill&nbsp;<U+2013> Purposes and Objectives], Lucis trust Website</ref>

==Writing==

===Comparison with Theosophy===
{{Theosophy}}

Theosophists are divided on their assessment of Alice Bailey's writings. For instance, the noted contemporary Theosophical writer [[Geoffrey Hodson]] wrote a highly favorable review of one her books, saying, "Once more Alice Bailey has placed occult students in her debt."<ref>Hodson, Geoffrey, ''World Theosophy Magazine,' February 1931&nbsp;<U+2013> June 1931, The Theosophical Society, 1931</ref> Olav Hammer writes, "Her first book, ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' was at first favorably received by her fellow theosophists. Soon, however, her claims to be recipient of ageless wisdom from the Masters met with opposition."<ref>[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]], ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of epistemology from theosophy to the new age." BRILL, 2001, p. 65</ref> The conflict is understandable since her works contain some criticisms of Theosophy, and at the time of the break she voiced her criticism of what she saw as dogmatic structures within the society, while questioning the pledges of loyalty to Theosophical leaders that were required. "During the annual convention of 1920 in Chicago, there was a power struggle between forces loyal to Besant and the Esoteric Section and others who believed that the ES had become too powerful. Below the surface was a hidden controversy regarding Alice's work with the Tibetan."<ref name="Keller, Rosemary 2006 p 762" /> For a more recent example of Bailey/Theosophy division, see [[Theosophy in Scandinavia]].

Campbell writes that Bailey's books are a reworking of major Theosophical themes, with some distinctive emphases, and that they present a comprehensive system of esoteric science and occult philosophy, cognizant of contemporary social and political developments.<ref>Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement, [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1980, p. 152</ref> Steven J. Sutcliffe points out that both Bailey and Blavatsky's work evoke a picture of Tibet as the spiritual home of the Masters and that Bailey claimed a more-or-less direct lineage to Blavatsky. He describes Bailey as a 'post-Theosophical' theorist, reporting that Bailey received instruction from "former personal pupils of Blavatsky", and notes that her third book (''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'') not only reproduces Blavatsky's apocryphal [[Stanzas of Dzyan]], but is dedicated to Blavatsky, as well.<ref>Sutcliffe, Steven J, ''Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices.'' Routledge, 2003, p 48</ref>

Jon Klimo, in ''Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources,'' writes, "As with Blavatsky/Theosophical material, and more recent contemporary channeled material from other sources, we find in the Bailey work the same occult cosmological hierarchy: physical, etheric, astral, mental, causal, and higher inhabited levels of existence."<ref>Klimo, Jon, Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources, J. Tarcher, Inc, 1987, p 118.</ref> [[Olav Hammer]], in the book ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age,'' highlights Bailey's Theosophical similarities as well as noting what he thinks are some differences between them: "To a large extent, Bailey's teachings are a restatement and amplification of theosophy of the ''Secret Doctrine.'' Bailey inherited from Blavatsky and Leadbeater a predilection for profuse details and complex classificatory schemes. ... Her books have also introduced shifts in emphasis as well as new doctrinal elements."<ref>Hammer, Olav, ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of epistemology from theosophy to the new age." BRILL, 2001, p. 65</ref>

In contrast to the above, some Theosophical critics have contended that there are major differences between Bailey's ideas and the Theosophy of Blavatsky, such as Bailey's embrace of some mystical Christian terms and concepts<!-- Which? --> and her acceptance of [[C.W. Leadbeater]].<ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 153">Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement, University of California Press, Berkeley, 1980, p. 153</ref><ref name=blava_arc>{{cite web |url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/baileyal.htm|title=Theosophy's Shadow: A Critical Look at the Claims and Teachings of Alice A. Bailey|author=Weeks, Nicholas|publisher=blavatskyarchives.com}}</ref>

Nicholas Weeks, writing for the Theosophical magazine ''Fohat'' in 1997, felt Bailey's assertion that "... her teachings are grounded in and do not oppose in any fundamental way Theosophy as lived and taught by HPB and her Gurus" was false, claiming her books are in fact "rooted in the [[Neo-Theosophy|pseudo-theosophy]] pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater." He claimed Bailey accepted Leadbeater's "fantasy" of the return of [[Maitreya]], and disparaged Bailey's ''[[Great Invocation]]'', a prayer supposed to "induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [and] enter into major cities" to lead the [[Aquarian Age]]. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on "the [[Christos]] principle within each person".<ref name=blava_arc/></blockquote>

The Blavatskian theosophists.
<br />
Some critics and often followers of the so-called Blavatskian theosophy on Atma-Vidya refer to the following quotes. The theosophical Master K.H. was given by H. P. Blavatsky to say: "the Salvation Army by hypnotizing people and making them psychically drunk with excitement, is Black Magic".<ref name="Blavatskyarchives">Some Commentaries on [H.P.B.'s Esoteric] Instructions I and II&nbsp;<U+2013> The Inner Group Teachings of H.P. Blavatsky, 2nd revised and enlarged edition, pp. xxiv and 197, compiled and annotated by Henk J. Spierenburg, San Diego, California, Point Loma Publications, 1995</ref> And H. P. Blavatsky stated in contrast with Alice A. Bailey's promotion of a Great Invocation arrival of a Maitreya Saviour in the flesh that: "(a) "the coming of Christ," means the presence of CHRISTOS in a regenerated world, and not at all the actual coming in body of "Christ" Jesus; (b) this Christ is to be sought neither in the wilderness nor "in the inner chambers," nor in the sanctuary of any temple or church built by man; for Christ<U+2014>the true esoteric SAVIOUR<U+2014>is no man, but the DIVINE PRINCIPLE in every human being. "<ref name="H. P. Blavatsky">The article named THE ESOTERIC CHARACTER OF THE GOSPELS by H. P. Blavatsky, Lucifer Magazine, 1887, 1888</ref> This can be compared with Alice A. Bailey.s "The Externalization of the Hierarchy", p.&nbsp;590.
<br />
H. P. Blavatsky also said in a letter to the honourable Abb<U+00E9> Roca: ''"In carnalizing the central figure of the New Testament, in imposing the dogma of the Word made flesh, the Latin Church sets up a doctrine diametrically opposed to the tenets of Buddhist and Hindu Esotericism and the Greek Gnosis. Therefore, there will always be an abyss between the East and the West, as long as neither of these dogmas yields."'' And further on she said, that a ''"true Theosophists will never accept either a Christ made Flesh, according to the Roman dogma, or an anthropomorphic God, still less a <U+201C>Shepherd<U+201D> in the person of a Pope"''.<ref name="Letters to Abb<U+00E9> Roca">Blavatsky Collected Writings, Vol. VII, pp. 372<U+2013>391&nbsp;<U+2013> NOTES ON ABB<U+00C9> ROCA<U+2019>S <U+201C>ESOTERICISM OF CHRISTIAN DOGMA<U+201D></ref> Alice A. Bailey wrote: ''"We have fought over the historical Christ, and thus fighting, have lost sight of His message of love to all beings. Fanatics quarrel over His words, and fail to remember that He was  'the Word made flesh.'"''<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''From Bethlehem to Calvary'', Lucis Trust. 1937, p. 7</ref> Alice A.

Another principle of Theosophy, the [[Law of Attraction]] was discussed in esoteric writings by Blavatsky,<ref>{{cite book|last=Blavatsky |first=Helena Petrovna |title=Isis Unveiled: Secrets of the Ancient Wisdom Tradition|coauthors=Michael Gomes |publisher=Quest Books |year=1997 |page=83 |isbn=0-8356-0729-1}}</ref> [[Annie Besant]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Besant |first=Annie Wood |title=Popular Lectures on Theosophy |publisher=Theosophical Publishing House |year=1919 |page=79}}</ref> [[William Quan Judge]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Judge |first=William Quan |title=The Ocean of Theosophy |publisher=United Lodge of Theosophists |year=1915 |page=103}}</ref> and others;<ref>{{cite book|last=Kumar |first=Sri K.

===The Seven Rays of energy===
Underlying her writings is the idea that [[Spiritual energy|all is energy]] and that spirit, matter, and the psychic forces intermediate between them are forms of energy.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 3: Esoteric Astrology''. Lucis Trust. 1951. p 353</ref> This energy is life itself.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Psychology I .'' Lucis Trust. 1936 p 194</ref> From one essential energy, divinity, proceed [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|seven rays]] that underlie and shape the evolution of human life and the entire phenomenal world.<ref>Jurriaance, Aart, ''Bridges, " Bridges Trust, South Africa, c. 1978, p. 35 & 73</ref> On a [[cosmos|cosmic]] level these seven rays of energy are the creative forces of [[planet]]s and [[star]]s. On a microcosmic level they are the creative forces conditioning the physical, psychic, and spiritual constitution of man. (Jurriaance, p.&nbsp;73<U+2013>152)

In ''Esoteric Psychology I'', the first book of ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays'', Bailey writes that the "one Life sought expansion" resulting in seven aeons, or emanations, manifesting in the expression of life, becoming the "seven Rishis of all the ancient scriptures."<ref name="Bailey, Alice 1936 pp 22-23">Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Psychology I .'' Lucis Trust. 1936 pp 22<U+2013>23</ref>

She enumerates these seven as:<ref>Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three&nbsp;<U+2013> Division A&nbsp;<U+2013> Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237</ref>

# [[Morya (Theosophy)|The Lord of Power or Will]]
# [[Kuthumi|The Lord of Love-Wisdom]]
# [[Paul the Venetian|The Lord of Active Intelligence]]
# [[Serapis Bey|The Lord of Harmony, Beauty and Art]]
# [[Master Hilarion|The Lord of Concrete Knowledge and Science]]
# [[Master Jesus|The Lord of Devotion and Idealism]]
# [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|The Lord of Ceremonial Order or Magic]]

Although described as "Lords" and "persons", Bailey states that these "great forces" are not to be understood in terms of human personality. She also cautions that any description of such things must be couched in terms of our particular planet, such that humanity can understand it, but that these "pure Being[s] ... have purposes and activities in which our Earth plays only a minor part."<ref name="Bailey, Alice 1936 pp 22-23" />

In Bailey's concept the rays and all things manifest in centers of energy and their relationships.<ref>Bailey, Alice A., ''The Destiny of the Nations, Lucis Trust, 1949, p 129</ref> All rays and centers are focuses of some type of evolving life or consciousness. (Jurriaance, p.&nbsp;35<U+2013>52) This includes everything from atoms to centers or chakras in the human constitution, and upwards through the human aura to groups of humans as centers, and cities and nations as centers. (Jurriaance, pp.&nbsp;79<U+2013>90 ) Humanity as a whole is conceived as a center of energy as are the masters of wisdom of which she writes.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 3: Esoteric Astrology''. Lucis Trust. 1951. p 22</ref> Likewise, planet Earth as a whole, with all its subsidiary centers of life, is viewed as a center of life within the large life or divinity of our [[solar system]].

The concept of the [[Seven Rays#In Theosophy|seven rays]] can also be found in Theosophical works.<ref>Wood, Ernest, ''The Seven Rays,'' Theosophical Publishing House, Wheaton, Illinois, 1925</ref> Campbell writes that Bailey, "...was the first to develop the idea of the seven rays, although it can be found in germ in earlier Theosophical writings."<ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 153" /> The seven rays also appear in Hindu religious philosophy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Colebrooke |first=Henry Thomas|title=Essays on the Religion and Philosophy of the Hindus |publisher=Williams and Norgate |year=1858 |pages=79, 83, 119 |quote=Reprinted from 'Asiatic researches' and from the 'Transactions of the Royal Asiatic society.'

===Esoteric astrology===

Esoteric astrology is based on Alice Bailey's "Ageless Wisdom" teachings, which she said were relayed by her Tibetan [[Ascended Master]], Djwhal Khul.<ref name="Leo 1978 318">{{cite book|title=Esoteric Astrology|last=Leo|first=Alan|year=1978|publisher=Destiny Books|isbn=0-89281-181-1|page=318}}</ref><ref name="Leo 2005 88">{{cite book|title=Symbolism and Astrology: An Introduction to Esoteric Astrology|last=Leo|first=Alan|year=2005|publisher=Cosimo Classics|isbn=1-59605-614-2|page=88}}</ref> "The Tibetan Master, Djwhal Khul, has provided a significant foundation for a more Soul-oriented approach to astrology and to the Life it seeks to symbolize and interpret."<ref name="The Crossing Press p. 14">{{cite book|title=Soul-Centered Astrology|last=Oken|first=Alan|year=1990|publisher=The Crossing Press, p. 14}}</ref>

Esoteric astrologers typically base their work on Bailey's five-volume series, ''Treatise on the Seven Rays.''  The third book in the series, ''Esoteric Astrology,''<ref>Bailey, Alice A. A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 3: Esoteric Astrology. Lucis Trust. 1951</ref> is considered to be the foundation for esoteric astrologers world wide."<ref name="Oken 1990"/>

Esoteric astrology's system of [[planet]]ary rulerships differs from that of conventional astrology, involves planets not conventionally used, and replaces the house system with a system of crosses with highly individualized meanings and multiple levels of interpretation. Esoteric astrology incorporates various elements of [[esotericism]] related to [[astrology]] and theory of [[Seven Rays]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Esoteric Astrology |author=[[Alan Leo]]|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear & Company |year= 1989|isbn= 0-89281-181-1 |page=13}}</ref>

According to Bailey, the following are the houses and their planetary rulers:<ref name="ReferenceA">Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 3: Esoteric Astrology''. Lucis Trust. 1951</ref>

===The constitution of man===
In line with previous Theosophical teachings,<ref>Leadbeater, C. W., ''A Textbook Of Theosophy,'' The Theosophical Publishing House, India, 1914, chapter I</ref> Bailey taught that man consists of a ''soul'' of abstract mental material, working through a ''personality''<U+2014>a technical term for the physical, emotional, and less-abstract mental ''bodies'' considered holistically.<ref name="Bailey, Alice 1953 p 564">Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing.'' Lucis Trust. 1953 p 564</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' Lucis Trust. 1922 p IV, chart III</ref> She uses traditional terms for these lower three "vehicles" or "sheaths": ''physical'' body, ''astral'' body and ''mental'' body. There is also the ''etheric'' body which directly corresponds to the physical but is the vital energizing agent for the whole of a man in all his forms of expression.  These auric aspects of the human being are defined as partial emanations or expressions of the soul, which is itself synonymous with the evolving human consciousness. The mind is not conceived to be simply an ephemeral brain effect, but as the motivating energy responsible for the inner constitution of individuals, and which also manifest as the [[aura (paranormal)|aura]].<ref>Jurriaance, Aart, ''Bridges, " Bridges Trust, South Africa, c. 1978, p. 130, 77, 91, 105</ref>

In Bailey's writings, ''evolution'' is defined as the process of bringing the "lower nature" his physical, emotional, and mental selves into integration and alignment with the ''will'' of the soul<U+2014>the "at-one-ment" of the personality.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 3: Esoteric Astrology''. Lucis Trust. 1951. p 364</ref> It is this transformation that leads to "right human relations" and spiritual revelation or awakening. Discrete steps on the spiritual path are called ''initiations'', which is to say that the evolving consciousness is entering into new and wider fields of awareness, relationships, responsibilities, and power.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' Lucis Trust. 1922 p16</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A., ''From Bethlehem to Calvary'' Lucis Trust. 1953, p 204</ref> In terms of her ray concept, the note of the soul is imposed (or superimposed) on the note of the personality.<ref name="Bailey, Alice 1953 p 564" /><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' Lucis Trust. 1922 p 132</ref>

===The Spiritual Hierarchy, Shamballa, Venus, and Sirius===
Bailey wrote that behind all human evolution stands a brotherhood of enlightened souls who have guided and aided humanity throughout history.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p 260</ref> For Bailey, the evolution of humanity was intimately bound up with its relationship to this Spiritual Hierarchy. She believed that the stimulating and uplifting influences of religions, philosophies, sciences, educational movements, and human culture in general are the result of this relationship,<ref>Jurriaance, Aart, ''Bridges, " Bridges Trust, South Africa, c. 1978, p. 209, 261, 268</ref> and though in time humanity debases all these developments, they are all in their original impetus conceived as the result of the Spiritual Hierarchy working in concert with evolving human potentials.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 275</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A, ''From Intellect to Intuition'' 1932 Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 132</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Discipleship in the New Age, Volume 1''. Lucis Trust. 1944. p 163</ref>

Bailey associated the spiritual hierarchy and its branches with the system of [[Sirius]], the planet [[Venus]], and the mythical land of [[Shambhala]] (which she spelled "Shamballa"), the residence of [[Sanat Kumara]], "Lord of the World". Bailey wrote, "The energy of Sirius by-passes (to use a modern word) Shamballa and is focused in the Hierarchy. [...] The entire work of the Great White Lodge is controlled from Sirius...."<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Rays and the Initiations''. Lucis Trust. pp 69,98,142,397,406,415,735</ref> [[Monica Sjoo]], in an essay about the [[New Age]] movement, explained her interpretation that "Bailey taught that the Hierarchy of Masters exists in Shambhala and that [[Venusians]] founded this fabled city some 18 million years ago on the sacred Gobi island, which is now in the Mongolian desert."<ref>[http://www.monicasjoo.org/books/naessay/newageessay4.htm retrieved October 22, 2007.]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}</ref> It may be noted here that, in Bailey's concept, "city" is figurative since she states that Shamballa is not physical in the common usage of that word but is rather located in "higher ethers."<ref>Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' 1932 Lucis Trust. 1925, p 753</ref>

===Teachings regarding Maitreya===

In the [[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]], she asserts that [[World War II]] was a cosmic conflict between [[good and evil]]. The Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, representing the ''[[Left-hand path and right-hand path|Forces of Light]]'', were on the side of the [[Allies]]; the ''[[Black magic|Dark Forces]]'' were on the side of the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  According to Bailey, [[Adolf Hitler]] was [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by the Dark Forces.<ref>Bailey, Alice A.(1957). ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy''. New York: Lucis. p. 425.</ref> With the defeat of the axis by the allies in 1945, the stage was set for the appearance of the being traditional Theosophists call [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], but whom Alice A. Bailey refers to simply as [[Christ]], to inaugurate the [[New Age]].

In January 1946, Bailey prophesied that since, according to her view, Christ (the name she used in her writings to refer to Maitreya) would return himself by manifesting a physical body of his own on the [[physical plane]],<ref>Bailey, Alice A. (1957). ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy''. New York: Lucis. ISBN 978-0-85330-106-6. p. 530</ref> Bailey in her books wrote that this would be the [[New Age]] equivalent of the Christian concept of the ''[[Second Coming of Christ]]''.<ref name="BaileyAlice">Bailey, Alice A. (1948). ''The Reappearance of the Christ''. New York: Lucis. ISBN 978-0-85330-114-1</ref>

She further stated that [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] (referred to as the ''Master Rakoczi'' or the ''Master R.'' in her books) is the manager of the executive council of Christ.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. (1957). ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy''. New York: Lucis. ISBN 978-0-85330-106-6. p. 508. Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey. Like C.W. Leadbeater, Bailey refers to St. Germain as the ''Master Rakoczi'' or the ''Master R.'' in her books.</ref> This executive council is a specific group of [[Ascended master]] charged with preparing the way for the Christ and the consequent inauguration of the [[Age of Aquarius]]. According to Bailey, when Christ returns, he will stay the entire approximately 2,150 year period of the Age of Aquarius, and thus the New Age equivalent of the [[Millennial Age]] will not be just a single  [[millennium]] but will be the Aquarian ''bimillennium''. During this era, said Bailey, Christ (Maitreya) will reign as the spiritual leader of Earth, the [[Messiah]] who will bring [[World Peace]].<ref name="BaileyAlice" />

In August 1946, DK through Bailey stated that Christ would return in an [[airplane, and thus fulfill the Christian prophesy of coming out of the clouds]] from "''the place on Earth where He has been for many generations''" and that after doing so, he would appear on worldwide [[television]].<ref>Bailey, Alice A. (1957). ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy''. New York: Lucis. ISBN 978-0-85330-106-6. pp. 575<U+2013>576. Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey.</ref>

===The Great Invocation===
The ''Great Invocation'' is a mantra given in 1937 to Bailey by Djwhal Khul. The mantra begins with "From the point of Light within the Mind of God, let light stream forth into the minds of men." with the rest of the passage reinforcing this idea of men acting in accordance with the plan of God. It is well known by some followers of the New Age movement, where it is used as part of meditation, particularly in groups.<ref name=melton57>{{cite book |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |title=New Age Encyclopedia |coauthors=Jerome Clark, Aidan A. Kelly |publisher=Gale Research Inc |year=1990 |page=57 |isbn=0-8103-7159-6}}</ref>

The invocation has been used in the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community since the 1970s. In response to the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]], the Great Invocation was used as a central element of a new daily program at Findhorn known as the "Network of Light meditations for peace".<ref name=sutcliffe138>{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Steven J, |title=Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |pages=138<U+2013>139 |isbn=0-415-24299-1}}</ref> Findhorn's use of the Great Invocation later spun off to various other groups they had influenced, including groups interested in [[Paranormal and occult hypotheses about UFOs|new age UFO philosophies]].<ref name=sutcliffe85>{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Steven J, |title=Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |page=85|isbn=0-415-24299-1}}</ref><ref name=Woodhead250>{{cite book |title=Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations|last=Woodhead |first=Linda |publisher=Routledge|page=250 |year=2002|isbn=0-415-21784-9}}</ref>

Rosemary Keller described the Great Invocation as a call for "the [[Christ]] to return to Earth" and wrote that Bailey-related groups purchased radio and television time to broadcast the invocation as part of their mission, and that often the invocation was recited in what Keller called "light groups", to accomplish what Bailey's disciples considered to be attracting and focusing "spiritual energies to benefit the planet".<ref name=Keller763/> Researcher Hannah Newman described what she found to be an antisemitic element in the Great Invocation. According to Newman, "the Plan" named in the invocation refers to the plan authored by "the Hierarchy", that Newman states places "high priority on removing all Jewish presence and influence from human consciousness, a goal to be achieved by eliminating Judaism."<ref name=levy351>{{cite book|title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |first=Richard S. |last=Levy |coauthors=Hannah Newman|year=2005 |pages=351<U+2013>352|publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1-85109-439-3}}</ref>

===Discipleship and service===
Bailey elaborated the relation of humanity to the Hierarchy in her teaching on ''Discipleship in the New Age''. A ''disciple'' is an accepted student, or [[wikt:chela#Etymology 2|chela]], in the spiritual [[ashram]] of a Master. In this scheme, all awakening souls stand in some relationship<U+2014>for a long time unconsciously, but eventually in full conscious awareness<U+2014>to some particular Master.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p 307</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire,'' Lucis Trust. 1925, p. 465</ref> The integrated personality, coming under the influence of the soul, is simultaneously coming under the influence of this Master.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Discipleship in the New Age, Volume 1''. Lucis Trust. 1944. p 688</ref> This relationship is determined by [[karma]], by evolutionary status, and (most importantly) by the aspirant's capacity for work to be done on behalf of humanity.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Discipleship in the New Age, Volume 1''. Lucis Trust. 1944. p 103</ref> This ''service'' aspect is strongly emphasized throughout Bailey's writings.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 37</ref> In her concept, the greatly increased ("stepped-up") evolution of consciousness that results from this Master<U+2013>pupil relationship is made possible ''only'' in and through service to humanity.

Bailey's writing downplayed the traditional devotional and aspirational aspects of the spiritual life, in favor of serving "the Plan of the Hierarchy" by serving humanity.<ref name=Lane132>{{cite book|title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age|last=Lane |first=David H.|page=132|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1996 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}} "One of the three fundamental requirements of the training in the School is "occult meditation" and disciples are taught to "cooperate with the Plan of Hierarchy" elaborated in the writings of Alice Bailey. Serving "the Plan" by serving humanity is central to the esotericism which forms a practical way of life for disciples and prepares them for "service in the Aquarian age". (''[footnote in situ]'' from the Arcane School brochure supplied by the Triangle Center, Wllington NZ. The Aquarian Age is the "New Age" issued in under the astrological sign Aquarius.)"</ref> According to her, this is primary, and everything hinges upon it.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 267</ref> For Bailey, ''discipleship'' means work<U+2014>''service''<U+2014>and the evolution of those sensitivities and powers that enhance that labor. Disciples will never gain such powers or awareness unless and until they will be used solely for unselfish service. (Bailey, p.&nbsp;38)

===Unity and divinity of nations and groups===
Underlying Alice Bailey's writing is the central concepts of unity and divinity.<ref>Bailey, Alice A., ''From Bethlehem to Calvary'' Lucis Trust. 1953, pp 69<U+2013>70, 80<U+2013>81, & 94</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 3: Esoteric Astrology''. Lucis Trust. 1951. p 561</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p 288</ref><ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Astrology,'' Lucis Trust. 1951. p 7</ref>

Although she often identified groups of people by their race, nationality, or religion, she said the key matter was not race or religion per se, but the evolution of consciousness that transcends these labels.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Rays and the Initiations,'' Lucis Trust. 19607. p. 593-594</ref></blockquote> In her writings about the races, she focused on the humanitarian concept of unity and stated that the source of human problems is the spirit of separation that causes individuals and groups to set themselves apart from the rest of humanity. (Bailey, p.&nbsp;375)

Ross describes Bailey's teachings as emphasizing the "underlying unity of all forms of life", and the "essential oneness of all religions, of all departments of science, and of all the philosophies."<ref>Ross, Joseph E., ''Krotona of Old Hollywood, Vol. II'' Joseph Ross, 2004, p. 398</ref> Campbell notes that the New Group of World Servers was established for "... promotion of international understanding, economic sharing, and religious unity."<ref name="Campbell, Bruce 1980 p. 153" />

===On fanaticism and intolerance===
Alice Bailey wrote strongly against all forms of fanaticism and intolerance.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. pp 17, 384</ref> She saw this fanaticism in churches, in nationalism, and in competing esoteric schools. (Bailey pp.&nbsp;15 & 453)<ref>{{harv|Bailey|1944}} p. 120</ref> She associated this fanaticism with unintelligent devotion and holding on to old ways and ancient theologies. Bailey indicated that these problems were found mostly in the older generations, that their fanaticism would limit their personal growth and that they would mostly find a solution for that limitation through devotion, and the forward movement of spiritual evolution.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on White Magic,'' Lucis Trust. 1934. p. 328</ref>

===Racial theories===
Bailey upheld theories of racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a "ladder of evolution". These 'races' do not represent a national or physical type, but a state of evolution. For example, she states that the Aryan [[Root race]] (or '5th race'), as an "emerging new race", are the most recently evolved people on Earth, although the term '[[Aryan]]' as used by her has a quite distinct meaning from the separative and racist use of the word. It refers not only to Caucasian peoples, but to origins in Indo-Persia, and indicates a culture where thought and intellect is dominant. In her book ''Education in the New Age'', Bailey made predictions about the use of occult racial theories in the schools of the future, which she said would be based on the idea of '[[root race]]s' (originally vast prehistoric spans of time covering thousands of years when a particular human facet was being developed) such as ''Lemurians'' (physically adept), ''Atlanteans'' (emotionally adept), Aryans (mentally adept), and the ''New Race'' with "group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision.".<ref>Bailey, ''Education in the New Age'', p.69-71</ref> However, she holds that the forthcoming 'sixth sub-race' (evolving from various facets of current 'fifth race' intellectual culture) cannot reach its peak until the 'sixth race' proper (due many thousands of years hence), and may therefore not be the advance some of her [[New Age]] followers wish for. In her ''The Destiny of the Nations'', Bailey described a process by which this "new race" will evolve, after which "low grade human bodies will disappear, causing a general shift in the racial types toward a higher standard."<ref name=Penn>Penn, Lee, ''False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One-World Religion'', p.264, Sophia Perennis, ISBN 1-59731-000-X</ref>

Her writings were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a [[cultural anthropologist]] and [[ethnographer]], who in a survey of modern [[Neopaganism]] in Russia, drew particular attention to "... groups [that] take an extremely negative view of multi-culturalism, object to the 'mixture' of kinds, [and] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration." He noted that a number of Bailey's books, as well as those of her contemporary [[Julius Evola]], had been recently translated into Russian, and said that "... racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its 'Jewish inheritance' and reject the 'Jewish Bible' as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius.".<ref name=Shnirelman>[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/13shnir.html Shnirelman, Victor A.

[[Monica Sj<U+00F6><U+00F6>]], a Swedish-born British artist, writer, and supporter of the [[Goddess movement]], wrote that Bailey, through her published teachings, had a "reactionary and racist influence on the whole [[New Age]] movement."<ref name=Sjoo>[[Monica Sj<U+00F6><U+00F6>|Sj<U+00F6><U+00F6>, Monica]] of the 1960s onward.

====On the Negro race====
Bailey stated that the [[Negro]] race contains a large number of "child souls", leading lives of "physical activity motivated by the desire for satisfaction of some kind, and by a shallow "wish-life" or desire nature, and almost entirely oriented towards the physical life."<ref name=esotericII-205>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=Esoteric Psychology II |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1942 |pages=204<U+2013>205 |isbn=0-85330-119-0}}</ref> She also wrote of the need for the white races to train the Negroes of Africa so that they will be fitted for true self-government.<ref name=problems108>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p= 108}}</ref>

She described Negro people as "creative, artistic and capable of the highest mental development when taught and trained&nbsp;<U+2013> as capable as is the white man;" and she emphasized the need for the white races to accord the Negro "the respect and the opportunity which is due him", stating that "The future peace of the world depends today upon enlightened, farseeing statesmanship and an appreciation of the fact that God has made all men free."<ref name=problems107-109>{{harv|Bailey|1944|pp= 107<U+2013>109}}</ref>

She wrote that what she described as "the Negro Problem" is divided into two areas: "the problem of the future of the African Negro and the problem of the future of the Negro in the western hemisphere."<ref name=problems106/>

=====On "the Negro problem" in Africa=====
Bailey considered the indigenous people of Africa to be in the "embryonic stage" of evolutionary development, and wrote that, "Behind the many separative religious cults of that dark land, there emerges a fundamental and pure mysticism, ranging all the way from nature worship and a primitive animism to a deep occult knowledge and an esoteric understanding which may some day make Africa the seat of the purest form of occult teaching and living."<ref name=problems106/> She said that "Right human relations must be firmly established between the emerging Negro empire and the rest of the world; the new ideals and the new world trends must be fostered in the receptive Negro consciousness and in this way darkest Africa will become a radiant center of light, ready for self-government and expressing true freedom."

=====On "the Negro problem" in the Americas=====
Regarding the relations between the Negro race and other races in the Western Hemisphere, Bailey wrote that it "constitutes a very ugly story, seriously implicates the white man and provides an outstanding disgrace", and that "The white people face a grave responsibility and it lies in their hands to change conditions."<ref name=problems113/> She was a vocal advocate of humane treatment and equal rights for the [[Negro]] race, acknowledged that they had been subject to much cruelty and exploitation by the white race, but also said that good had come of this for Negroes, and described reason for optimism regarding their future prospects.<ref name=problems106>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p= 106}}</ref></blockquote> She advocated improvement in the situation of the Negro in the United States, calling for the people of America to end discrimination, to accept the Negro population as brothers and friends and thereby bring about positive change.<ref name=problems113>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p=113}}</ref> She also wrote that in the black peoples' attempt to resolve their problem of separation in society, "the spiritual forces of the world are on the side of the Negro."<ref>{{harv|Bailey|1944}} p. 96, 85 & 110</ref>

====On the Jewish people====

Bailey wrote much about the [[Jewish people]], referring to them collectively as a race, with group [[karma]], characteristics, and behaviors. Specifically, she was of the opinion that Jews embody the characteristics of "materialism, cruelty and a spiritual conservatism" and the "separative, selfish, lower concrete mind."<ref name=extern77-79/><ref name=rays707>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Rays and the Initiations |publisher=Lucis Press |year=1972 |page=707 |isbn=0-85330-122-0}}</ref>

=====On the social characteristics of the Jews=====
Bailey described Jews as "the most reactionary and conservative race in the world", explaining this as a result of their need to preserve their cultural identity as a wandering people under persecution. She wrote that, "People complain (and it is frequently true) the Jews lower the atmosphere of any district in which they reside. They hang their bedding and their clothing out of the windows. They live on the streets, sitting in groups on the sidewalks."<ref name=auto-120>{{cite book|title=The Unfinished Autobiography of Alice A. Bailey|last=Bailey|first=Alice A|publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1951 |page=120 |isbn=0-85330-024-0}}</ref>

She wrote that Jews "take what they want, to see to it that their children get the best of everything available, no matter what the cost to others"; they "blame the non-Jewish nations for their miseries"; and, "The Jew needs to recognize his share in bringing about the dislike which hounds him everywhere."<ref name=problems103-105>{{harv|Bailey|1944|pp= 103<U+2013>105}}</ref>

She stated that even though the Jews are "possessed of great wealth and influence", they create "dissension among the nations" and "almost abusive, demands for the [[Gentile]] to shoulder the entire blame and end the difficulty."<ref name=problems103-105/>

=====On "the Jewish Problem"=====
Bailey said that what she called the "Jewish problem"<ref name=problems97-105>{{harv|Bailey|1944|pp=97<U+2013>105, Section 1. "The Jewish Problem"}}</ref><ref name=esotericI-393>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=Esoteric Psychology I |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1936 |pages=393, section 2<U+2013>III-b. "The Jewish Problem"}}</ref> was the result of negative [[karma]] accumulated by the Jews due to "acts and deeds there claimed by him as his racial acts and deeds (conquest, terrorism and cruelty)..." and wrote that the solution to this "problem" will come "...when the races regard the Jewish problem as a humanitarian problem but also when the Jew does his share of understanding, love and right action. This he [the Jew] does not yet do, speaking racially."<ref name=extern77-79>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Externalization of the Hierarchy |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1957 |pages=77<U+2013>79 |isbn=0-85330-106-9}}</ref>

Before World War II, she wrote: "The major racial problem has, for many centuries, been the Jewish, which has been brought to a critical point by Germany...";<ref name=extern195>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Externalization of the Hierarchy |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1957 |page=195 |isbn=0-85330-106-9}}</ref> that the Jews "constitute an international minority of great aggressiveness, exceedingly vocal";<ref name=problems95>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p= 95}}</ref> and that while they are an ancient, civilized and cultured people, their problems as a "struggling minority" are the result of "certain inherent characteristics", and the "untidy effect they have on any community".<ref name=problems86-97>{{harv|Bailey|1944|pp= 86, 97}}</ref>

In 1939, as World War II began, Bailey wrote that "the Jewish problem, is definitely producing cleavage as a part of the divine plan... to bring humanity to certain realizations and decisions."<ref name=extern88>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Externalization of the Hierarchy |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1957 |pages=88<U+2013>89 |isbn=0-85330-106-9}}</ref>

In 1948, after the war and the [[Holocaust]], she wrote that "there are eighty percent of other people in the concentration camps, only twenty percent Jews", and that Jews have not only repudiated the [[Messiah]], but they have forgotten their unique relation to humanity.<ref name=Penn/><ref>Bailey, ''The Rays and the Initiation, p.635</ref>

Bailey also wrote critically about hatred of the Jews and predicted a future in which Jews would "fuse and blend with the rest of mankind."<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Psychology I .'' Lucis Trust. 1936 p 401</ref> In her autobiography, she stated that she had been on Hitler's "blacklist", and she believed this had been because of her defense of the Jews during her lectures throughout Europe.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. p 119</ref> She criticized the cruelty of "the Gentile" (non-Jewish people) for their treatment of the Jews, stating "great is his responsibility for wrong doing and cruel action."<ref name=problems102>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p= 102}}</ref>

Bailey further stated that the Jews were themselves responsible for the bad treatment they received, "Changed inner attitudes are needed on both sides, but very largely on the side of the Jews." She was aware of and accepted the controversial nature of her comments in this regard.<ref name=problems103-105/>

====On interracial marriage====
Bailey wrote regarding [[interracial marriage]] that "the best and soundest thinkers in both the white and black races at this time deplore mixed marriages. They mean no happiness for either party." She also advised against intermarriage between [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and [[Asian people|Asians]] but said that children of interracial unions would be unavoidable following World War II due to the actions of what she called the "inevitable promiscuity" of the armies during that period. She wrote that "children of [[mixed race]], as well as the half-castes and the [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] may be the answer to a large part of the problem. There will be hundreds of thousands of these children of mixed parentage, forming part of the world population in the next generation and immediate cycle and they are a group with which we will have to reckon."<ref name=problems114>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p= 114}}</ref>

While she believed that intermarriage would not solve what she called "the Negro problem,"<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Healing.'' Lucis Trust. 1953 p 267</ref> she implied this might change and on this issue, "I make no prophecy about the future."<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Unfinished Autobiography''. Lucis Trust. 1951. pp 107</ref>

Her comments on the topic of interracial marriage are conflicting: On the one hand she suggested that mixed marriages have unhappy effects, on the other hand she seemed to view them as positive and contributing to the solution of racial tensions.<ref>{{harv|Bailey|1944}} pp 113<U+2013>114</ref> Elsewhere she wrote that marriages are rooted in soul relationships,<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire,'' Lucis Trust. 1925, p. 797</ref> and that intermarriage in general is not a solution to racial problems, but that the solution lies in appreciation of the good qualities found in groups other than one's own.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p 195</ref> Her contrary statements thus reflect the mixed and emerging views of the time in which she was writing.

===On nationalism and nations===
Bailey criticized national groups, based on what she believed were their violations of the spirit of unity and brotherhood. She believed that an individual's primary allegiance is to humanity and not to any subgroup within it: "I call you to no organizational loyalties, but only to love your fellowmen, be they German, American, Jewish, British, French, Negro or Asiatic."<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p 208</ref>

====On the United States and France====
While praising the United States and France in some respects, Bailey saw in them political corruption.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. '' Esoteric Astrology.'' Lucis Trust. 1947 p 526</ref><ref>{{harv|Bailey|1944}} p 16</ref> She regarded the talk about a free press as largely an illusory ideal and stated, "... particularly is it absent in the United States, where parties and publishers dictate newspaper policies."<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy .'' Lucis Trust. 1947 p 452</ref>

====On Israel, Zionism, and the U.S.S.R.====
Regarding the foundation of the modern nation of [[Israel]] after World War II, Bailey said that "The Jews, by their illegal and terrorist activities, have laid a foundation of great difficulty for those who are seeking to promote world peace."<ref name=rays429>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Rays and the Initiations |publisher=Lucis Press |year=1972 |page=429 |isbn=0-85330-122-0}}</ref>

Bailey criticized [[Zionism]], comparing it with the [[Stalinist]] regime: "Zionism today stands for aggression and for the use of force, and the keynote is permission to take what you want irrespective of other people or of their inalienable rights. These points of view are against the position of the spiritual leaders of humanity, and therefore the leaders of the Zionist movement, and the group of men who direct and control the policies of Russia, are against the policies of the spiritual Hierarchy and are contrary to the lasting good of mankind. ... The menace to world freedom today lies in the known policies of the rulers of the U.S.S.R. and in the devious and lying machinations of the Zionists."<ref name=rays680>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=The Rays and the Initiations |publisher=Lucis Press |year=1972 |page=680 |isbn=0-85330-122-0}}</ref>

====On the "present world crisis"====
Bailey said, "We could take the nations, one by one, and observe how this nationalistic, separative or isolationist spirit, emerging out of an historical past, out of racial complexes, out of territorial position, out of revolt and out of possession of material resources, has brought about the present world crisis and cleavage and this global clash of interests and ideals."<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p. 375</ref> In 1947, in listing the causes of world conflict, she cited the fight for oil, and the fight over Palestine, "[...] a fight which has greed and not any love of Palestine behind it, and which is governed by financial interests and not by the humanitarian spirit which the Zionists claim [...]".<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalization of the Hierarchy,'' Lucis Trust. 1957. p 615</ref>

===On organized religions===
Bailey taught a form of universal spirituality that transcended denominational identification, believing that, "Every class of human beings is a group of brothers. Catholics, Jews, Gentiles, occidentals and orientals are all the sons of God." She stated that all religions originate from the same spiritual source, and that humanity will eventually come to realize this, and as they do so, the result will be the emergence of a universal world religion and a "new world order."<ref name=Lane139>{{cite book|title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age|last=Lane |first=David H.|page=139|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1996 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}}</ref><ref name=Hick155>{{cite book|title=Dialogues in the Philosophy of Religion |last=Hick |first=John |page=155|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2001 |isbn=0-333-76103-0}}</ref> Bailey described a world where there would be no separate religions but rather "one great body of believers." She predicted that these believers would accept unified truths based on brotherhood and "divine sonship", and would "cooperate with the divine Plan, revealed to them by the spiritual leaders of the race." She wrote that this was not a distant dream but a change that was actually occurring during the time of her writing. (Bailey, p 140)</blockquote>

Despite her focus on unity of religion, Bromley and Hammond point out that Bailey and other "occultists" "...hammered home the central idea, 'The East is the true home of spiritual knowledge and occult wisdom.'"<ref name=bromley1>{{cite book |last=Bromley |first=David G.|coauthors=Phillip E. Hammond |title=The Future of New Religious Movements |publisher=Mercer University Press |year=1987 |page=15 |isbn=0-86554-238-4}}</ref>

Author Steven Sutcliffe wrote that Bailey's "World Goodwill" organization was promoting groups of "world servers" to, as he quotes Bailey, "serve the Plan, Humanity, the Hierarchy and the Christ."<ref name=sutcliffe51>{{cite book |last=Sutcliffe |first=Steven J, |title=Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |page=51 |isbn=0-415-24299-1}}</ref>

====On Judaism====
Bailey was highly critical of Judaism. She wrote: "The word 'love' as it concerns relation to other people is lacking in their religious presentation, though love of [[Jehovah]] is taught with due threats; the concept of a future life, dependent upon conduct and behavior to others and on right action in the world of men, is almost entirely lacking in The [[Tanach|Old Testament]] and teaching on immortality is nowhere emphasized; salvation is apparently dependent upon the keeping of numerous physical laws and rules related to physical cleanliness; they go so far as to establish retail shops where these rules are kept&nbsp;<U+2013> in a modern world where scientific methods are applied to purity in food. All these and other factors of less importance set the Jew apart, and these he enforces no matter how obsolete they are or inconvenient to others."<ref name=problems100>{{harv|Bailey|1944|p= 100, Section 1. "The Jewish Problem"}}</ref>

Because of writings like these, the American [[Chassidic]] author Rabbi [[Yonassan Gershom]] wrote that Bailey's plan for a [[New World Order (conspiracy)|New World Order]] and her call for "the gradual dissolution<U+2014>again if in any way possible<U+2014>of the [[Orthodox Jewish]] faith" revealed that "her goal is nothing less than the destruction of [[Judaism]] itself." Gershom also wrote that "This stereotyped portrayal of Jews is followed by a hackneyed diatribe against the Biblical Hebrews, based upon the "angry Jehovah" theology of nineteenth-century Protestantism. Jews do not, and never have, worshipped an angry vengeful god, and we Jews never, ever call God "Jehovah."<ref name=Gershom>Gershom. Yonasan. [http://www.pinenet.com/rooster/bailey.html ''Antisemitic Stereotypes in Alice Bailey's Writings'']. 1997, revised 2005. Retrieved 2007-08-22.</ref>

====On Christianity====
Bailey wrote of "the return of the Christ", but her concept had little in common with that of mainstream Christian churches. Bailey almost always used the phrase "''the'' Christ" when not referring specifically to the Christian idea. For her, the leadership of the Hierarchy is an "office" (so to speak), to be occupied by various Masters in the course of Their unfolding evolution. She saw the Christ as a great "Person", embodying the energy of love, and His return as the awakening of that energy in human consciousness.<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''Esoteric Astrology,'' Lucis Trust. 1951. p. 471</ref> She also introduced the ideas that the new Christ might be "of no particular faith at all", that he may be from any nation, race, or religion, and wrote that his purpose of returning will be to "restore man's faith in the Father's love" in a close personal relationship with "all men everywhere".<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Reappearance of the Christ,'' p 190</ref>

She stated that no one particular group can claim Him<U+2014>that the New Age Christ belongs to whole world, and not to Christians alone, or to any nation or group. (Bailey, p 109) Bailey was highly critical of mainstream Christianity; she wrote that much of the Church's teaching about Christ's return is directly opposed to His own intentions and that "The history of the Christian nations and of the Christian church has been one of an aggressive militancy" (Bailey, p 110)

==Influence==
Alice Bailey's influence can be seen on the groups she founded, on a variety of religious and spiritual authors, and on groups that have utilized her writings in their own teachings.

===Groups founded by Bailey or her followers===
The Arcane School, founded by Alice and Foster Bailey to disseminate spiritual teachings, organizes a worldwide "Triangles" program to bring people together in groups of three, for daily meditation and study. Their belief is that they receive divine energy through meditation; this energy is transmitted to humanity, so raising spiritual awareness.<ref>"New Age Movement", subsection "Origins", in ''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica.'' 2003</ref> John Michael Greer's ''New Encyclopedia of the Occult'' states that the school "seeks to develop a New Group of World Servers to accomplish the work of the Hierarchy of Masters, under the guidance of its head, the Christ."<ref name=greer31>{{cite book |last=Greer |first=John Michael |title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide |year=2003 |page=31 |isbn=1-56718-336-0}}</ref>

James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton, in ''Perspectives on the New Age'' wrote, "The most important<U+2014>though certainly not the only<U+2014>source of this transformative metaphor, as well as the term "New Age", was Theosophy, particularly as the Theosophical perspective was mediated to the movement by the works of Alice Bailey."<ref>Lewis, James R. and J.

===Influence on neopaganism===
Several writers have mentioned the affinity of some of Bailey's concepts with modern expressions of [[paganism]].<ref>Roberts, Richard H., & Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: paganism in the modern world'', Edinburgh University Press, 1998,pp 34, 41<U+2013>43, 203, 219</ref><ref>Kemp, Daren, ''New Age: A Guide,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2004, p. 57</ref>

During the 1960s and 1970s, the [[neopagan]] author and [[ceremonial magic]] ritualist Caroll Poke Runyon published a magazine called ''The Seventh Ray,'' its name taken from the writings of Alice Bailey. In the 1990s, two volumes of collected articles from the magazine were published as ''The Seventh Ray Book I, The Blue Ray'' and ''The Seventh Ray Book II, the Red Ray.''

===Influence on women in religion===
Author [[Catherine Wessinger]] wrote that Bailey was a liberated woman "... sixty years before it became popular"; that Bailey's books expressed a similar "millennial view" to the works of Annie Besant; and that they were "an important source of the contemporary New Age movement."<ref>Wessinger, Catherine Lowman, ''Women's Leadership in Marginal Religions: Explorations Outside The Mainstream.'' University of Illinois, Press, 1993, p. 80</ref>

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America'', several leaders of New Age philosophy have further developed Bailey's teachings, including the well-known personalities [[JZ Knight]] (who channels the entity known by the name [[Ramtha]]), [[Helen Schucman]] (author of [[A Course in Miracles]] through the process of telepathic dictation she called "scribing"),and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (who published what she referred to as "dictations from Ascended Masters").

The "Tibetan" teacher, Djwal Khul, whom Bailey claimed was the co-author of many of her books, has also been claimed as co-author by two new female channelers, Violet Starre and Moriah Marston. Starre claims to have channeled Bailey's old teacher twice: the title of her first book, ''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More'', owes an obvious debt to Bailey's writings, and is sometimes listed in book catalogues under the full title "''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A. Bailey)'' by Djwhal (channeled Through Violet Starre) Khul.".<ref>Djwhal (channeled Through Violet Starre) Khul ''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A. Bailey)'' Light Technology Publishing (2000)</ref> The same influence can also be seen in Starre's ''The Amethyst Light: Djwhal Khul Through Violet Starre'', published in 2004. Marston's ''Soul Searching with Djwahl Khul, the Tibetan'', was published in 2006, and according to her publisher, Airleaf Books, "She has been a conscious channel for Ascended Master Djwhal Khul since 1986."

===Influence on psychotherapy and healing===
In 1930, with the patronage of English-Dutch spiritualist, theosophist and scholar [[Olga Froebe-Kapteyn]], Bailey established the short-lived "School of Spiritual Research" located on Froebe-Kapteyn's estate, Casa Gabriella, in Switzerland. (In 1932 the school was closed due to personal conflict between Bailey and Froebe-Kapteyn, at which time Froebe-Kapteyn replaced it with the [[Eranos]] group.) [[Roberto Assagioli]], founder of [[Psychosynthesis]], was a lecturer at School of Spiritual Research.<ref>McGuire, William. ''An Adventure in Collecting the Past''. Princeton University Press. 1989, p 23</ref> He continued a close association with Bailey during the 1930s; some of his writings were published in Bailey's magazine ''The Beacon''; and he was a trustee of Bailey's organization, the Lucis Trust.<ref>Roberts, Richard H., & Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World,'' p.44</ref> He had developed his approach to psychology, called Psychosynthesis, beginning in 1910; his methods were later influenced by some elements of Bailey's work.<ref>Grof, Stanislav, ''The Adventure of Self-Discovery,'' SUNY Press, 1988 p. 123</ref><ref>Bromley, David G. & Phillip E. Hammond, ''The Future of New Religious Movements,'' Mercer University Press, 1987,</ref><ref>Steichen, Donna M., ''Ungodly Rage: Hidden Face of Catholic Feminism,'' Ignatius Press, 1991, p.</ref><ref>Rossman, Martin L.; Contributor Dean Ornish ''Guided Imagery for Self-Healing,'' H.

Kramer, 2000, page 213</ref><ref>Visser, Frank; Contributor Ken Wilber, ''Ken Wilber: Thought As Passion,'' SUNY Press, 20093 p. 307</ref> However, authors John Firman and Ann Gila write that Assagioli kept what he referred to as a "wall of silence" between the areas of psychosynthesis and religion or metaphysics, insisting that they not be confused with each other.<ref>{{cite book|title=Psychosynthesis: A Psychology of the Spirit |last=Firman|first=John|coauthors=Ann Gila|year=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0-7914-5533-5|pages=16}}</ref>

Roger J. Woolger said, in a paper presented to the "Beyond the Brain" Conference held at [[Cambridge University]] in 1999, "In [[David Tansley|Tansley]] as in [[Barbara Brennan|Brennan]] you will find descriptions of a hierarchy of subtle bodies called the etheric, emotional, mental and spiritual that surround the physical body. (Interestingly Tansley attributed the source of his model to Alice Bailey's theosophical commentary on The [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], the ''locus classicus'' of Hindu teaching.)"<ref>Woolger, Roger J., [http://www.rogerwoolger.com/images/Beyond_the_Brain.pdf ''The Presence of Other Worlds In Psychotherapy and Healing''] from a paper delivered at the Beyond the Brain Conference held at St. John's College, Cambridge University, England, 1999.</ref>

Bailey's influence can be found in therapeutic communities with which she was never directly involved, such as the [[Human Potential Movement]].<ref name=Keller763/>

===Influence on UFO groups===
Christopher Partridge wrote that the works of Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, and Theosophy in general all influenced what he called the "[[UFO religion]]s".<ref name="Partridge 2003">{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Christopher H. |title=UFO Religions |publisher=Routledge |year=2003}} Pages 8&nbsp;<U+2013> 9</ref> He explained that "...Theosophy has several prominent branches, and, strictly speaking, the branch which has had the most important influence on the UFO religion is that developed by Alice Bailey.".<ref>Partridge, Christopher H. ''The Re-enchantment of the West'' p. 175 [http://books.google.com/books?id=mPKeVWeLq1UC&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=alice+bailey+hierarchy+of+masters+from+venus&source=web&ots=Q9dC4ssjeA&sig=PT4d0yuNm8REHtzO9kvtsKDTDEo]
Retrieved October 22, 2007</ref> Partridge also quoted Gordon Melton, who suggested that the first UFO religion was [[Guy Ballard]]'s [["I Am" Activity]],<ref name="Partridge 2003"/> which Bailey described as a "cheap comedy."<ref>{{cite book |last=Bailey |first=Alice A. |title=The Externalization of the Hierarchy |publisher=Lucis Trust |year=1957}} Page 16.</ref>

Professor Robert S. Ellwood of the University of Southern California investigated a wide range of religious and spiritual groups in the United States during the 1970s, including a nationwide group of UFO believers called Understanding, Inc., which had been founded by a [[contactee]] named [[Daniel Fry]]. He reported that, "There is no particular religious practice connected with the meeting, although interestingly the New Age Prayer derived from the Alice Bailey writings is used as an invocation."<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellwood |first=Robert S. |title=Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1973|isbn=0-13-773317-8}} Pages 143&nbsp;<U+2013> 145: "Understanding, Inc." and "Reading Selection: Understanding, Inc."</ref>

[[George D. Chryssides]] of the [[University of Wolverhampton]], cited Bailey's influence on the ideas of the [[Order of the Solar Temple]] and related UFO organisations.<ref>[http://www.cesnur.org/2005/pa_chryssides.htm Chryssides, George D. An untitled paper] presented at the [[CESNUR]] Conference held in Palermo, Sicily, 2005.</ref>

[[Benjamin Creme]], formerly a member of the UFO religion the [[Aetherius Society]], became a follower of Alice A. Bailey and then proclaimed in 1975 that he had been contacted by [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] to prepare for the return of Maitreya to Earth that had been prophesied by Alice A. Bailey in 1946. Alice A. Bailey prophesied in January 1946 that (since [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] had repudiated the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)#Jiddu_Krishnamurti|''"World Teacher Project"'']]) [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Christ]] (in her books she refers to Maitreya as ''The Christ'' or ''The World Teacher'', not as ''Maitreya'') would return himself by manifesting a physical body of his own on the [[physical plane]] "sometime after AD 2025"<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Externalisation of the Hierarchy'' New York:1957 Lucis Publishing Co. Page 530</ref> and that this would be the New Age equivalent of the Christian concept of the ''[[Second Coming of Christ]]''<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''The Reappearance of the Christ'' New York:1948 Lucis Publishing Co.</ref> (See [[Maitreya (Benjamin Creme)]]).

==Esoteric astrology==
Whereas most astrology focuses on the personality, the [[esoteric astrology]] of Alice Bailey seeks to explain the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and its desire for [[spiritual evolution]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Esoteric Astrology: A New Astrology for a New Millennium, Vol. 1 (Seven Pillars of Ancient Wisdom)|last=Baker|first=Douglas|year=1998|publisher=Dr D M Baker|page=314|isbn=0-906006-01-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Esoteric Astrology, Part VIII The Soul's Purpose|last=Baker|first=Douglas|year=1982|publisher=Dr D M Baker|page=178|isbn=0-906006-67-8}}</ref> Esoteric astrology is grounded in Bailey's (Djwhal's) Ageless Wisdom teachings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Esoteric Astrology]|last=Leo|first=Alan|year=1978|publisher=Destiny Books|page=318|isbn=0-89281-181-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Symbolism and Astrology: An Introduction to Esoteric Astrology|last=Leo|first=Alan|year=2005|publisher=Cosimo Classics|page=88|isbn=1-59605-614-2}}</ref> According to one writer, "The Tibetan Master, Djwhal Khul, has provided a significant foundation for a more Soul-oriented approach to astrology and to the Life it seeks to symbolize and interpret."<ref name="The Crossing Press p. 14"/>

The esoteric astrologers who follow the teachings of Bailey typically base their work on her five-volume ''Treatise on the Seven Rays, particularly volume three which focuses on astrology.<ref name="Oken 1990">{{cite book|title=Soul-Centered Astrology|last=Oken|first=Alan|year=1990|publisher=The Crossing Press}}</ref>

In esoteric astrology the [[seven rays]] are applied to the [[astrological]] signs and planets, with a corresponding "soul urge", in the following manner (taken from Oken<ref name="Oken 1990"/>).
* The First Ray: ''Will/Power'' --- Signs: ''[[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]'' --- Planets: ''[[Vulcan (hypothetical planet)|Vulcan]], [[Pluto]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"The use of spiritual will for the benefit of the collective; power utilized for the purpose of enhancing unity and beauty; the expression of will for the purposes and being of the group."'' (p. 105)
* The Second Ray: ''Love/Wisdom'' --- Signs: ''[[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]'' --- Planets: ''[[Jupiter]], [[Sun]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"The urge to bring about a sustaining, loving wholeness to any group or life situation; the ability, through magnetic attraction, to bring about healing; the focus for the stimulation of consciousness, and hence for greater love/wisdom; the ability to see beyond differences into unifying principles."'' (p. 110)
* The Third Ray: ''Active Intelligence'' --- Signs: ''[[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]'' --- Planets: ''Earth, [[Saturn]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"The birthing of ideas to benefit humanity; the structuring of time and activities to allow for group energies to flourish; inherent, objective intelligence ready to be used in service to humanity in all ways."'' (p. 114)
* The Fourth Ray: ''Harmony through Conflict'' --- Signs: ''[[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]'' --- Planets: ''[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Moon]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"The 'Divine Artist'&nbsp;<U+2013> one who seeks to raise humanity's consciousness through the realization of the beauty and harmony existing in nature and in the world of forms; the mediator between heaven and earth, God and man; the Priest."'' (p. 122)
* The Fifth Ray: ''Concrete Knowledge'' --- Signs: ''[[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]'' --- Planet: ''[[Venus]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"Those who work to be connecting links of intelligence between the abstract world of pure ideation and the concrete world of practical application; precision and exactitude in creating those forms and inventions which allow for the outpouring of Higher-Mind Intelligence."'' (p. 127)
* The Sixth Ray: ''Devotion and Idealism'' --- Signs: ''[[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]'' --- Planet: ''[[Mars]], [[Neptune]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"The urge to transform selfish and personal motivation into selfless, impersonal devotion for the good of all; the bringing about of circumstances which reorient the exclusive to the inclusive for the greater expression of Love/Wisdom."'' (p. 133)
* The Seventh Ray: ''Ceremonial Order and Magic'' --- Signs: ''[[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]'' --- Planet: ''[[Uranus]]''
:Soul Urge: ''"The urge to gather, formulate, and harmonize various aspects of a given set of life circumstances into an ordered expression for the Will of God; the urge to make 'heaven on earth.'"'' (p. 139)

The planetary and house rulers differ in esoteric astrology as compared to exoteric astrology. The esoteric planetary and house rulers are to be used when a person is analyzing the soul's purpose or journey through life. According to Djwhal Khul (Alice Bailey), here are the rulers.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Alice Bailey wrote in ''Esoteric Astrology,'' "The human being in his eventual recognized group relationships is of more importance than appears in his individual life, which the orthodox horoscope seeks to elucidate. It only determines his little destiny and unimportant fate. Esoteric astrology indicates his group usefulness and the scope of his potential consciousness."

==Esoteric Healing==
Esoteric healing is a major subject in the philosophical writings of Alice Bailey. It is contained in the fourth volume of "The Treatise on the Seven Rays".<ref>Bailey, Alice A. ''A Treatise on the Seven Rays, Vol 4: Esoteric Healing''. Lucis Trust. 1953</ref> The primary emphasis of esoteric healing is not on the physical body or any of the three personality bodies of the human being (physical, emotional, mental), but on the soul. It is the soul that heals. This is stated in the "Law One of Esoteric Healing": "All disease is the result of inhibited soul life. This is true of all forms in all kingdoms. The art of the healer consists in releasing the soul so that its life can flow through the aggregate of organisms which constitute any particular form." The primary healing ray is ray two. More advanced esoteric healing allows the practitioner to work with their own soul ray and the soul ray of the patient. Volume IV (''Esoteric Healing'') was first published in 1953. It took until the 1970s for a group to adequately assimilate the teachings and begin to put it into practice. Brenda Johnston founded the International Health Research Network in 1971. In 1984 the group became a registered charity in UK, with its name changed to the International Network of Esoteric Healing (INEH). The international group remains small but it has spread to about 20 countries with training of students by trained teachers of esoteric healing, esoteric healing clinics, national and international conferences annually. They also have a biannual Journal. Although INEH requires membership of its organization, esoteric healing remains open to anyone wishing to practice the art.

==Alice A. Bailey in popular culture==
'''[[Music]]'''
* In 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called "Initiation" on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Initiation]], taught by Alice A. Bailey and C.W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called "A Treatise on Cosmic Fire"; the three parts of the song are listed as: "I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire." The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''. Also in 1975, Rundgren released an album by his side-project [[Utopia (band)|Utopia]] titled "[[Another Live]]."  This album contained a song titled "The Seven Rays" (see reference above).  Finally, in 1977, Rundgren followed up with another Bailey reference with a song entitled "Love in Action" from the Utopia album [[Oops! Wrong Planet]]. Love in Action was the concept promoted by Bailey's and Foster Bailey's "World Goodwill" organization.
* In 1982, Bailey's influence appeared in [[pop culture]], with the release of [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Beautiful Vision]]'', in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs "[[Dweller on the Threshold (song)|Dweller on the Threshold]]" and "Aryan Mist".<ref>{{cite book|title=Music for Inner Space|last=Drury|first=Nevill|year=1985|publisher=Prism Press|page=60|isbn=0-9589759-0-6}}</ref> Morrison also used the phrase "world of glamour", reminiscent of Bailey's ''Glamour: A World Problem'', in the songs "[[Ivory Tower (Van Morrison song)|Ivory Tower]]" and "Green Mansions". The song [[Ancient of Days (song)|Ancient of Days]] from the 1984 [[Sense of Wonder]] album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as ''[[The Externalization of the Hierarchy]]''. Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan's ''Glamour: A World Problem'' is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison's album ''[[Inarticulate Speech of the Heart]]''.
