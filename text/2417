==Professional football==
===Return specialist: 1996-1998===
Toomer was selected by the [[New York Giants]] in the second round (34th overall pick) of the [[1996 NFL Draft]].<ref name=PFR/>  In July 1996, he signed a three-year contract with the Giants providing a $670,000 signing bonus and salaries of $269,000 in 1996, $336,000 in 1997, and $403,000 in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=Giants Sign Second Pick|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 22, 1996|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/22/sports/pro-football-giants-sign-second-pick.html}}</ref>

In his first three seasons with the Giants, Toomer was principally used as a [[punt returner|punt]] and [[kickoff returner]]. In his first NFL game, the opening game of the [[1996 New York Giants season|1996 season]], Toomer set a Giants' record with an 87-yard punt return for a touchdown against the [[Buffalo Bills]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Toomer Shakes Jitters And Catches On Fast|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 7, 1996|url=}}</ref>  He returned a second punt for a touchdown that season against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], before injuring his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) and spending the rest of the season on [[injured reserve]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Giants Are Still Feeling Toomer's Injury Exit|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 6, 1996|url=}}</ref>  Toomer led the NFL in 1996 with an average of 16.1 yards on 19 punt returns.<ref name=PFR/>

He also began to see increased playing time as a receiver, registering 27 catches for 360 yards and five touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/>  In Week 14, in a come-from-behind victory over the previously-undefeated [[Denver Broncos]], Toomer caught a 37-yard touchdown pass from [[Kent Graham]] with 48 seconds left in the game as the Giants ruined the Broncos' dream of a perfect season by winning 20-16.<ref>{{cite news|title=Broncos Perfect No Longer; Giants Win|newspaper=Lakeland Ledger (AP story)|date=December 14, 1998|page=C1|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19981214&id=Qr0wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z_wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6281,4993707&hl=en}}</ref> Toomer later publicly acknowledged that his slow start as an NFL receiver was the result of exercise-induced asthma which he had hidden for years.  After seeking treatment for the condition, his receiving career blossomed in 1999 and 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL's Amani Toomer wins big against asthma|date=October 22, 2001|newspaper=USA Today|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlight/2001-10-22-toomer-asthma.htm}}</ref>

===Prime years: 1999-2003===
During the [[1999 New York Giants season]], Toomer became a starting wide receiver in all 16 games. That year, he broke the team record for receptions in a season (79), and his 1,183 receiving yards were the second highest in team history behind [[Homer Jones (football player)|Homer Jones]].  

In 2000, Toomer appeared in all 16 regular season games (14 as a starter) for the Giants and posted solid totals with 78 receptions for 1,094 yards and seven touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/> With [[Kerry Collins]] at [[quarterback]], the [[2000 New York Giants season|2000 Giants team]] advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXV]] (a loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]]), and Toomer started all three postseason games for the team.  He totaled 10 catches for 135 yards and a touchdown in the [[2000<U+2013>01 NFL playoffs]].<ref name=PFR/>

During the [[2001 New York Giants season]], Toomer appeared in all 16 regular season games, caught more than 70 passes, and gained over 1,000 receiving yards for the third consecutive year.<ref name=PFR/> 

Toomer had the best year of his NFL career in [[2002 New York Giants season|2002]].  He set Giants' single-season records with 82 receptions and 1,343 receiving yards.  His eight receiving touchdowns in 2002 was also a career high. His total of 204 receiving yards against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] was also the highest total for a Giants wide receiver in a 60-minute game (two players had higher receiving totals, but both of those games went to [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]]).

In [[2003 New York Giants season|2003]], Toomer started all 16 games and had his fifth consecutive season with at least 1,000 receiving yards.  He totaled 63 catches for 1,057 yards and five touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/>  In the second game of the season, a Monday night game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Toomer broke [[Frank Gifford]]'s club record for receiving yardage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Homecoming sweet for Parcells|newspaper=McCook Daily Gazette|date=September 16, 2003|page=12|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1933&dat=20030910&id=2qggAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZmkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1480,2153490&hl=en}}</ref>

===2004 to 2006 seasons===
The [[2004 New York Giants season|2004 season]] marked the first time since Toomer's rookie year in which he did not score a touchdown.  Toomer appeared in 15 games and had 51 catches for 747 yards, the sixth consecutive season in which he topped 50 catches and 700 yards.<ref name=PFR/>

During the [[2005 New York Giants season|2005 season]], the Giants had a new starting quarterback, [[Eli Manning]], who threw for almost 3,800 yards. [[Plaxico Burress]] took over as the Giants' #1 receiver, but Toomer still started all 16 games and had 60 receptions for 684 yards and seven touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/>  Toomer's 2005 highlights included a last second touchdown reception against the Denver Broncos, a late game-tying touchdown at Seattle, and a fourth-and-goal touchdown catch against the Rams.

Toomer started strongly in the [[2006 New York Giants season|2006 season]].  In a Week 2 game against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], he  tallied a career-high 12 receptions and scored two touchdowns to help spark a 17-point comeback.  Physically exhausted by game's end, he had to be carried off the field by trainers.<ref name=Quiet/> Toomer's season came to an end after eight games when he suffered a partially torn [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL]] in his left knee.<ref>{{cite news|title=Setbacks for Giants Spread as Toomer Is Out for Season|date=November 9, 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/09/sports/football/09giants.html}}</ref> In eight games during the 2006 season, Toomer had 32 receptions for 360 yards and three touchdowns.<ref name=PFR/>  The Giants compiled a 6-2 record in the first half of the season with Toomer in the lineup, but fell to 2-6 in the second half without Toomer.  Giants head coach [[Tom Coughlin]] noted, "There's no question Amani has a very positive effect on Eli."<ref name=NYT07/>  Quarterack [[Eli Manning]] also praised Toomer: "He has a way of being in the right place at the right time."<ref name=NYT07>{{cite news|title=Toomer Thrives in Right Place at Right Time|date=August 19, 2007|newspaper=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/sports/football/19giants.html}}</ref>

The [[2007 New York Giants season|2007 Giants]] advanced through the playoffs and won [[Super Bowl XLII]] over the previously undefeated [[2007 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]].

This catch broke the club record for most postseason receptions. Toomer had two touchdown catches in the Giants' 21-17 upset over the [[2007 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]]. His first touchdown gave the Giants a 7-0 lead after he caught an 11-yard pass, eluded three tacklers and ran 50 yards for the score.
