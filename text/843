'''Polish decrees''', '''Polish directives''' or '''decrees on Poles''' ({{lang-de|Polenerlasse}}) refer to the decrees of the [[Nazi Germany]] government announced on the 8th March 1940 during [[World War II]].<ref name=HerbertTempler71>Ulrich Herbert, William Templer, ''Hitler's foreign workers: enforced foreign labor in Germany under the Third Reich'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0521470005,[https://sslvpn.pitt.edu/,DanaInfo=books.google.com+books?hl=en&lr=&id=uifw3BgBDU4C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Polenerlasse+&ots=tudl0NntfL&sig=6vSH_hgWPsJU7bmtFLy8XTWFyHw Google Print, p.71]</ref> They concerned the [[Poles|Polish]] laborers (''[[Zivilarbeiter]]'') [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|used during WWII as forced laborers in Germany]], regulating their working and living conditions.<ref name=HerbertTempler71/> The regulation intentionally supported and even created [[discrimination]] on the grounds of ethnicity.<ref name=HerbertTempler71/><ref name=HerbertTempler72>Ulrich Herbert, William Templer, ''Hitler's foreign workers: enforced foreign labor in Germany under the Third Reich'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0521470005,[https://sslvpn.pitt.edu/,DanaInfo=books.google.com+books?hl=en&lr=&id=uifw3BgBDU4C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Polenerlasse+&ots=tudl0NntfL&sig=6vSH_hgWPsJU7bmtFLy8XTWFyHw Google Print, p.72]</ref>

==Purpose==
The decrees were an important step on [[Codification|codifying]] Nazi Germany policies and laws on foreign forced labor.<ref name=HerbertTempler71/> They were meant to provide a legal basis for discriminating against Poles, fulfilling at the same time Nazi ideology and [[Nazi economy]] needs.<ref name=HerbertTempler71/> The racially-founded notion of the inferiority of the forced laborers and prisoners of war from Poland when compared with the German [[master race]] was a prominent feature of the orders.<ref name=HerbertTempler72/> The decrees, which recommended that examples of severe punishment be demonstrated to workers early on, were also aiming at clearly distinguishing the new conditions from pre-war voluntary [[seasonal labor]].<ref name=HerbertTempler74>Ulrich Herbert, William Templer, ''Hitler's foreign workers: enforced foreign labor in Germany under the Third Reich'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0521470005,[https://sslvpn.pitt.edu/,DanaInfo=books.google.com+books?hl=en&lr=&id=uifw3BgBDU4C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Polenerlasse+&ots=tudl0NntfL&sig=6vSH_hgWPsJU7bmtFLy8XTWFyHw Google Print, p.74]</ref>

==Specific content==
Polish workers were required to wear a clearly visible badge, in addition to a work permit with a photo.<ref name=HerbertTempler72/> They should be kept away from German "cultural life" and "places of amusement" (this would include churches and restaurants).<ref name=HerbertTempler72/> Sexual contact between Polish males and German women was prohibited, and to that end, it was recommended to recruit either the same amount of Polish males or females, or set up [[brothel]]s.<ref name=HerbertTempler72/><ref name=HerbertTempler73>Ulrich Herbert, William Templer, ''Hitler's foreign workers: enforced foreign labor in Germany under the Third Reich'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0521470005,[https://sslvpn.pitt.edu/,DanaInfo=books.google.com+books?hl=en&lr=&id=uifw3BgBDU4C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Polenerlasse+&ots=tudl0NntfL&sig=6vSH_hgWPsJU7bmtFLy8XTWFyHw Google Print, p.73]</ref> Mobility of workers, housed as far away as possible from Germans, was to be restricted, hence they were barred from using public transportation.<ref name=HerbertTempler72/> They were also affected by after dark [[curfew]].<ref name=HerbertTempler72/> Wages paid to Polish workers were to be lower than those paid to the German workers.<ref name=HerbertTempler73/> Polish workers were also to receive substandard nutrition. They were not allowed certain types of possessions (bicycles, cameras). They often were denied holidays and had to work seven days a week. They could not enter a marriage without permission Births were discouraged, children were sometimes taken away from their families (see [[kidnapping of Polish children by Nazi Germany]]).

Punishments for disobeying, for Polish workers, included being sent to a [[concentration camp]] and death penalty.<ref name=HerbertTempler73/><ref name=HerbertTempler74/> Germans who disobeyed those laws by helping or sympathizing with the workers were to be punished as well, in extreme cases, by being sent to concentration camps as well.<ref name=HerbertTempler74/>

==Application==

In 1939 there were about 300,000 prisoners from Poland working in Germany;<ref name="BeyerSchneider">{{citeweb|author=John C. Beyer|coauthors=Stephen A.

Forced laborers worked in agriculture, but also manufacturing. For example, some Polish forced laborers were employed by German arm of [[Ford]].<ref>Reinhold Billstein, Karola Fings, Anita Kugler, Nicholas Levis, Billstein Levis, ''Working for the enemy: Ford, General Motors, and forced labor in Germany during the Second World War'', Berghahn Books, 2004, ISBN 1845450132, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fHYh1QxFnFwC&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=Polenerlasse+-wikipedia&source=bl&ots=Q7ina-Rgpi&sig=PZM_dqW-KhpuB4l0lPl6HqjvtQc&hl=en&ei=O7BgSubjH8fSlAffprzZCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3 Google Print, p.144]</ref>

Were voluntary recruitment failed to yield a required number of workers, penalties were issued on communities that failed to provide workers (confiscation of property, fines); later, manhunts were organized (see [[<U+0142>apanka]]).<ref>M. L.

Worker's life was almost totally regimented.<ref name=HerbertTempler74/> 

In December 1941 the decrees were supplemented by Polish Criminal Regulation (''Polenstrafrechtsverordnung''), which introduced [[kangaroo court|shortened trials]] for Poles in criminal cases. In February 1942 Eastern decrees (''Ostarbeitererlasse'') were issued concerning the [[OST-Arbeiter]] (workers from territories taken from Soviet Union); based on the Polish decrees.<ref>Ulrich Herbert, William Templer, ''Hitler's foreign workers: enforced foreign labor in Germany under the Third Reich'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 0521470005, [https://sslvpn.pitt.edu/,DanaInfo=books.google.com+books?hl=en&lr=&id=uifw3BgBDU4C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=Polenerlasse+&ots=tudl0NntfL&sig=6vSH_hgWPsJU7bmtFLy8XTWFyHw Google Print, p.xvii]</ref>
