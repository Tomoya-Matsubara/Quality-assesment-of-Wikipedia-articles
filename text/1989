'''''The Man''''' is a [[graphic novel]]la for children, written and illustrated by [[Raymond Briggs]] and published by Julia MacRae Books in 1992. The duologue tells the humorous story of a boy, John, who is visited by the titular Man, a minuscule human ([[homunculus]]) who arrives in the boy's bedroom [[Nudity|unclothed]] and [[Hunger|hungry]]. After getting over his initial shock, the boy starts to take care of him.  The story follows their relationship over the next few days between John and 'Man', with the Man showing himself to be demanding, bossy and messy, but nevertheless a bond forms between the pair. Their time together involves many funny and peculiar moments, such as an odd obsession with "Frank Cooper's Oxford marmalade", using socks for jumpers, and a near-death collision with a marmalade jar.

Unlike the boy and Snowman in Briggs' famous wordless picture book ''[[The Snowman]]'', both characters have full dialogue throughout, with each character's lines formatted differently so that they can be distinguished. Occasionally the dialogue and drawings are interspersed so that speech bubbles surround certain lines of text.

Dutch and Danish-language editions were published in 1993 and the first U.S. edition in 1995.<ref name=worldcat/> Later there was an [[audiobook]] edition, with [[Micheal palin|Micheal Palin]] voicing the Man.

For both writing and illustrating ''The Man'' Briggs won the 1992 [[Kurt Maschler Award]], or "the Emil". The award from Maschler Publications and [[Booktrust]]<!--all years?--> annually (1982 to 1999) recognised one British "work of imagination for children, in which text and illustration are integrated so that each enhances and balances the other."<ref name=bizland/>

== Plot ==

John awakes one morning to find a tiny man standing next to his bed, demanding to be clothed. Initially assuming he is dreaming, the boy gets up and finds a fur mitten to be used as a sleeping bed, before cutting up a sock for the Man to wear as clothes. He then makes some breakfast, being corrected on the brand of food he should have in future, such as Frank Cooper<U+2019>s Oxford Marmalade and Channel Island milk. John then questions where his guest has come from, and assumes he is a Borrower, E.T., fairy, or gnome (and later Nazi refugee), much to the Man<U+2019>s annoyance. John then decides to use his <U+2018>secrets cupboard<U+2019> as a space for him to sleep in.

Later John bathes the Man, before drying and cutting his hair. Before he leaves to shop, the Man then makes him swear that he won<U+2019>t tell anyone about him, including the authorities, and then pricks their fingers as an oath. The boy returns later with his shopping and uses his Dad<U+2019>s record cassette brush as a  toothbrush (later making a tiny flannel and basin), before the Man climbs up the house and uses the drainpipe to urinate, citing Job 38 atop the roof.

The next day, the two awake and start talking about names, with the Man stating he has never had one, also commenting on his lack of proper education. Later he explains there are not many of his <U+2018>people<U+2019>, and John states that he is undiscovered and could be looked after and studied by the government; exasperated, the Man disagrees with this idea. Downstairs, John<U+2019>s mother asks why he has bought Oxford marmalade (and later the Gold Top milk), and John hides the real reason. Likewise, the Man also requests for John to get him some beer, and subsequently he finds some old Guinness in the garage. The Man also uses John<U+2019>s Walkman with his permission, and whilst listening to the radio<U+2019>s Sunday morning service, starts to sing the hymns aloud. Afterwards, he notes all of the boy<U+2019>s useful possessions, contemplating why he has nothing, unlike most other people.

As the evenings draws in, the Man asks for a Bible and begins reciting Job 14 aloud, much to John<U+2019>s infuriation. Later, John is angered again when he is blamed for getting marmalade on the phone; the Man owns up and clarifies he tried to ring someone regarding the loss of his clothes, before going out onto the roof and praying a little, despite stressing he is not religious.

In the morning, John makes a boiled egg for the Man, and later queries what he is going to do with him. Angrily, the Man retorts that he is able to live his life as he wishes, staying in residences, and eventually John confesses he enjoys his company. Sometime later, the man asks for more needed supplies and John complains he has spent too much on his guest, who has also become very demanding. The Man then explains that he is expecting a call, despite being engaged when he tried before, and that he had told them John<U+2019>s address before the day he arrived at the house. He goes on to clarify that he had studied the day-to-day life of John<U+2019>s home, (at one point even spending Christmas there), and that a sudden emergency at his past settlement had forced him to leave immediately and make for the house.

Later that day, the Man asks for some beef, despite the boy<U+2019>s parents being vegetarians, and subsequently they cook them in his bedroom fire much to the Man<U+2019>s pleasure. However, his mum discovers more Marmalade everywhere and blames John. Later he is forced to eat in his room, wondering why he bothered to take the Man in, to which the Man deduces that it was because of his fascinating size and that he could be easily hidden away, much like a pet, not because John was being kind. Later John apologizes and the Man forgives him, much to their disbelief.

That night, the Man asks to sleep John<U+2019>s hand and shares a tender moment explaining his species<U+2019> lack of ability to lead a human life and how dangerous the world is for them. Later, upon a realisation, the boy notes the Man<U+2019>s brown and hairy appearance and deduces he is foreign. The man states he can<U+2019>t stand foreigners as well as all 'barging about' humans, resulting in John almost throwing him out. Meanwhile, in bed, John<U+2019>s parents contemplate about how strange John<U+2019>s behaviour has been lately.

The next day when his parents are out, John agrees to let the man make his own cup of tea. The man manages this, but upon attempting to open the jar of marmalade, accidentally smashes it and almost kills himself in the process. John saves him and later as he cleans up the mess, complains to himself about his role as a servant to the Man. Once they start their meal, he states he likes watching the Man eat. Infuriated, the Man tells him that he doesn<U+2019>t want his life being a performance and that the boy only helps him since he is a <U+2018>toy<U+2019> and <U+2018>novelty<U+2019> due to his size, whilst John argues that the Man uses his own size to order him around and disguise his true personality. After their argument ends, John<U+2019>s father tells him off downstairs regarding the mess around the house, and later John returns to voice his annoyance to the Man.

That evening, the boy explains that he heard people on the radio who are in need of care, like the Man, and that he wishes to hand him over to the authorities. After almost phoning a care home, in retaliation, knowing he would die, the Man threatens to commit arson on the house. John then realises he could kill them all, and decides to talk a walk outside, with the Man doing the same.

In the morning, John wakes up to find the Man gone and a note left for him, outlining the Man had to leave as a result of a <U+2018>three day<U+2019> rule, and that the boy was more kind to him than anyone in his life. He also adds that he managed to receive his clothes. The story ends with John sobbing for the departure of his friend.
