'''''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas''''' is a [[1993 in film|1993]] [[stop motion]] [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Henry Selick]] and produced/co-written by [[Tim Burton]]. It tells the story of [[Jack Skellington]], a being from "[[Halloween]] Town" who opens a [[portal (fiction)|portal]] to "[[Christmas]] Town". [[Danny Elfman]] wrote the [[film score]] and provided the singing voice of Jack, as well as other minor characters. The remaining principal voice cast includes [[Chris Sarandon]], [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]], [[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]] and [[Glen Shadix]].

The genesis of the [[Neo-gothic_surrealism|neo-gothic surrealistic]] film known as ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' started with a poem by Tim Burton as a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney animator]] in the early-1980s. With the success of ''[[Vincent (film)|Vincent]]'' in 1982, Disney started to consider ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' as either a [[short subject]] or 30-minute [[television special]]. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990, Burton and Disney made a development deal. Production started in July 1991 in [[San Francisco]]. [[Walt Disney Pictures]] decided to release the film under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner because they thought ''Nightmare'' would be "too dark and scary for kids".<ref name=IGN/> ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' has been viewed with critical and financial success. Disney has [[reissue]]d the film annually under their [[Disney Digital 3-D]] format since 2006.

==Plot==
"[[Halloween]] Town" is a [[dream world (plot device)|dream world]] filled with citizens such as [[deformity|deformed]] [[monster]]s, [[ghost]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[werewolf|werewolves]] and [[witchcraft|witches]]. [[Jack Skellington]] ("The Pumpkin King") leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween ("This is Halloween"), but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year ("Jack's Lament"). Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a [[portal (fiction)|portal]] to "[[Christmas]] Town" ("What's This?"). Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his (somewhat limited) understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas ("Town Meeting Song").

Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of [[Santa Claus]] ("Jack's Obsession"). [[Sally (The Nightmare Before Christmas)|Sally]], a [[rag doll]] woman who is created by the town's [[mad scientist]], [[Dr. Finklestein]], begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack. However, she receives a [[premonition]] that his plans will end in disaster and attempts in vain to warn him, however Jack is blinded by his enthusiasm for Christmas to her warnings. Jack assigns every resident in Halloween Town a task to help with Christmas ("Making Christmas"). Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town ("Kidnap the Sandy Claws"). Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio deliver Santa to [[Oogie Boogie]], a gambling-addict [[bogeyman]] who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake ("Oogie Boogie's Song").

[[Christmas Eve]] arrives and Sally attempts to stop Jack, but he embarks into the sky on a coffin-like sleigh pulled by skeletal [[reindeer]], guided by the glowing nose of his ghost dog Zero, much to Sally's dismay ("Sally's Song"). He begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the gifts (shrunken heads, Christmas tree-eating snakes, etc.) only terrify the recipients. Jack is believed to be an impostor attempting to imitate Santa, and the military goes on alert to blast him out of the sky. The sleigh is shot down and he is presumed dead by Halloween Town's citizens, but in fact he has survived the crash. Although he is depressed by the failure of his plan, he quickly regains his old spirit and appreciation for former role as the Pumpkin King, having come up with new ideas for next Halloween ("Poor Jack"). He then rushes back home to rescue Santa and put things right.

Meanwhile, Sally attempts to free Santa, but is captured by Oogie. Jack slips into the lair and frees them, then defeats Oogie by unraveling his outer covering to spill out all the bugs that comprise him. With Oogie gone, Santa reprimands Jack before setting off to deliver the right presents to the world's children. He makes [[snow]] fall over Halloween Town to show that there are no hard feelings between himself and Jack; the townspeople are confused by the snow at first, but soon begin to play happily in it. Jack reveals that he is attracted to Sally just as she is to him, and they kiss under the full moon in the cemetery ("Finale/Reprise").

==Production==
Burton wrote a three-page poem titled ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' when he was a [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney animator]] in the early-1980s. Burton took inspiration from [[television special]]s of ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' and the poem ''[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]''.<ref>[[Tim Burton]], [[Henry Selick]], [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028555/ ''The Making of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas''], 2000, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]</ref> With the success of ''[[Vincent (film)|Vincent]]'' in 1982, Disney started to consider ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' as either a [[short subject]] or 30-minute Holiday television special. [[Rick Heinrichs]] and Burton created [[concept art]] and [[storyboard]]s, with Heinrichs also [[sculpture|sculpting]] character models.<ref name=Gems>Mimi Avins (November 1993). "Ghoul World", ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'', pp. 24<U+2013>30. Retrieved on 2008-09-26.</ref> "Back then, I would have done anything to get the project off ground", Burton explained. "There was a lot of talk of either a short film, like ''Vincent'' or a TV special, but it went nowhere. I also wanted to have [[Vincent Price]] as narrator." Burton showed [[Henry Selick]], who was also a Disney animator in the early-1980s, the material he and Heinrichs developed.<ref name=Tim/> 

Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project. In 1990, Burton found out that Disney still owned the [[film rights]], and the two committed to produce a full-length film with Selick as director.<ref name=Tim/> Disney was looking forward to ''Nightmare'' "to show capabilities of technical and storytelling achievements that were present in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR104069 | title = BV toons up down under | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = [[1993-02-18]] | accessdate = 2008-09-26}}</ref> ''Nightmare'' marked Burton's third film in a row to have a Christmas setting. Burton could not direct because of his commitment to ''[[Batman Returns]]'' and he did not want to be involved with "the painstakingly slow process of [[stop-motion]]".<ref name=Tim/> To adapt his poem into a screenplay, Burton approached [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]], his collaborator on ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. McDowell and Burton experienced creative differences, which convinced Burton to make the film as a [[musical film|musical]] with lyrics and compositions by frequent collaborator [[Danny Elfman]]. Elfman and Burton created a rough storyline and two-thirds of the film's songs,<ref name=Elfman/> while Selick and his team of animators began production in July 1991 in [[San Francisco, California]]<ref name=Tim/> with a crew of 200 workers.<ref>{{cite news | author = Brian Gallagher | title = Henry Selick Talks ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' | url = http://www.movieweb.com/news/NE8qtf98rxaQb8 | work = Movie Web | date = [[2008-08-22]] | accessdate = 2008-09-27}}</ref> [[Joe Ranft]] worked as a storyboard artist, while [[Paul Berry (animator)|Paul Berry]] was hired as an animation supervisor.<ref name=IGN/>

[[File:Burtonandselick.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Selick (left) and Tim Burton (right)]]

Elfman found writing ''Nightmare'''s 10 songs as "one of the easiest jobs I've ever had. I had a lot in common with [[Jack Skellington]]."<ref name=Gems/> [[Caroline Thompson]] still had yet to be hired to write the screenplay.<ref name=Elfman/> With Thompson's screenplay, Selick stated, "there are very few lines of dialogue that are Caroline's. She became busy on other films and we were constantly rewriting, reconfiguring and developing the film visually."<ref name=dreams/> The work of [[Ray Harryhausen]], [[Ladislas Starevich]], [[Edward Gorey]], [[Charles Addams]], [[Jan Lenica]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]] influenced the filmmakers. Selick described the [[production design]] as akin to a [[pop-up book]].<ref name=Gems/><ref name=dreams/> In addition, Selick stated, "When we reach Halloween Town, it's entirely [[German Expressionism]]. When Jack enters Christmas Town, it's an outrageous [[Dr. Seuss]] setpiece. Finally, when Jack is delivering presents in the "Real World", everything is plain, simple, and perfectly aligned."<ref>[[Henry Selick]], [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468757/ Pete Kozachik], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2000, [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]</ref> 

On the direction of the film, Selick reflected, "It's as though he [Burton] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job to make it look like "a Tim Burton film", which is not so different from my own films."<ref name=dreams>David Helpern (December 1994). "Animated Dreams", ''[[Sight & Sound]]'', pp. 33&mdash;37. Retrieved on 2008-09-26.</ref> When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when we made it. He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total."<ref name=dreams/> [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] contributed with some use of second-layering [[traditional animation]].<ref name=Tim>Salisbury, Burton, p.115&mdash;120</ref> Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing ''Batman Returns'' and in [[pre-production]] of ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.<ref name=Elfman/>

===Character design===
The filmmakers constructed 227 puppets to represent the characters in the movie, with Jack Skellington having "around four hundred heads", allowing the expression of every possible emotion.<ref>Richard Rickitt, ''Special Effects: The History and Technique'' (Watson-Guptill, 2000), 159-[http://books.google.com/books?id=U3hH9z24c80C&pg=PA160&dq=%22Jack+Skellington%22+%22character%22&lr=&ei=iaEbScyWL4HWMJfy2aYM#PPA160,M1 160].</ref>  Sally's mouth movements "were animated through the replacement method.  During the animation process,...only Sally's face 'mask' was removed in order to preserve the order of her long red hair.  Sally had ten types of faces, each made with a series of eleven expressions (e.g. eyes open and closed, and various facial poses) and synchronised mouth movements."<ref>Maureen Furniss, ''Art in motion: animation aesthetics'' (1998), [http://books.google.com/books?id=aQ4mrirF5nkC&pg=RA1-PA168&dq=Sally+%22Nightmare+Before+Christmas%22+greatest+characters#v=onepage&q=&f=false 168].</ref>

===Marketing===
The owners of the franchise have undertaken an extensive marketing campaign of these characters across many media.  In addition to the "Haunted Mansion Holiday at Disneyland" featuring "Tim Burton's ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' characters,"<ref>Ramin Setoodeh, "HAUNTED PARKS", ''Newsweek'' 144.16 (10/18/2004): 73.</ref> Jack Skellington, Sally, Pajama Jack, and the mayor have been made into Bendies figures,<ref>Frederick J.

Oddly enough, Jim Edwards actually contends that "Tim Burton's animated movie ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' is really a movie about the marketing business. The movie's lead character, Jack Skellington, the chief marketing officer (CMO) for a successful company decides that his success is boring and he wants the company to have a different business plan. Some have wondered which real-life company failure the movie is based on: Sergio Zyman's New Coke or Merck's launch and subsequent withdrawal of Vioxx."<ref>Jim Edwards, "Jack Skellington, Brand Manager", ''Brandweek'' 47.40 (10/30/2006): 21.</ref>

==Soundtrack==

The film's [[The Nightmare Before Christmas (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] was released in 1993 on [[Walt Disney Records]]. For the film's 2006 re-release in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], a special edition of the soundtrack was released, featuring a bonus disc which contained covers of several of the film's songs by [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Panic! at the Disco]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Fiona Apple]] and [[She Wants Revenge]].

==Release==
[[Walt Disney Pictures]] decided to release the film under their [[Touchstone Pictures]] banner because they thought ''Nightmare'' would be "too dark and scary for kids". Selick remembered, "Their biggest fear, and why it was kind of a stepchild project, [was] they were afraid of their core audience hating the film and not coming. It wasn't too dark, too scary. Kids love to get scared. In fact, I don't think it's too scary at all. Even little, little kids, as young as three, a lot of them love that film and respond well to it."<ref name=IGN>{{cite news | author = Scott Collura | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/740/740769p1.html | title = ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' 3-D: 13 Years and Three Dimensions Later | work = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-10-20]] | accessdate = 2008-09-27}}</ref> To help market the film "it was released as ''Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas''," Burton explained. "But it turned more into more of a [[brand#brand name|brand-name]] thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not quite sure about."<ref name=Elfman/>

Around the release of the film, Touchstone president David Hoberman quoted, "I hope ''Nightmare'' goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] so it doesn't have to earn ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]''-sized grosses to satisfy us."<ref name=Gems/> The film [[premier]]ed at the [[New York Film Festival]] on October 9.<ref>{{cite news | author = John Evan Prook | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR109733 | title = ''Christmas'' comes to N.Y.

[[Danny Elfman]] was worried the characterization of [[Oogie Boogie]] would be considered [[racism|racist]] by [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).<ref>{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | date =1999 | pages =137<U+2013>148 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Burtonland}}</ref> Elfman's predictions came true; however, director Henry Selick stated the character was inspired by the [[Betty Boop]] cartoon ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (film)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]''. "[[Cab Calloway]] would dance his inimitable jazz dance and sing "[[Minnie the Moocher]]" or "Old Man of the Mountain", and they would [[rotoscoping|rotoscope]] him, trace him, turn him into a cartoon character, often transforming him into an animal, like a walrus," Selick continued. "I think those are some of the most inventive moments in cartoon history, in no way racist, even though he was sometimes a villain. We went with [[Ken Page (actor)|Ken Page]], who is a black singer and he had no problem with it".<ref name=dreams/> The film was nominated for both the [[Academy Award for Visual Effects]] and the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], but lost both categories to ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1994 | title = 66th Academy Awards | accessdate = 2008-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | work = [[Internet Movie Database]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Hugo_Awards/1994 | title = Hugo Awards: 1994 | accessdate = 2008-09-26}}</ref> ''Nightmare'' won the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]], while Elfman won [[Saturn Award for Best Music|Best Music]].

Jamie Frater ranks the film first on a list of Top 10 Kids' Movies Adults Will Love, calling the film,  "One of the most memorable and wonderful family films ever.  Christmas, Halloween, and Tim Burton, how can it miss?  The soundtrack from Danny Elfman is amazing, with witty, beautiful tunes and lyrics.  Jack is perfectly realized as the 'town hero' who seeks more in his life (or death, as it may be), a place we all find ourselves time to time.  Sally is loverlorn and pines for Jack to not only love her, but to just notice her.  Incredibly animated by Henry Selick, based on Tim Burton's original story, NBX has become a cult classic that...is a true masterpiece."<ref>Jamie Frater, "Top Ten Kids' Movies Adults Will Love," ''The Ultimate Book of Top 10 Lists: A Mind-Boggling Collection of Fun, Fascinating and Bizarre Facts on Movies, Music, Sports, Crime, Celebrities, History, Trivia and More'' (Berkeley: Ulysses Press, 2010), 380.</ref>

==Abandoned sequel==
In 2001, Walt Disney Pictures began to consider producing a sequel, but rather than using [[stop motion]], Disney wanted to use [[computer animation]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Fred Topel | title = Director Henry Selick Interview <U+2013> ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' | date = [[2008-08-25]] | work = [[About.com]] | url = http://movies.about.com/od/nightmarebeforechristmas/a/nightmare082508.htm | accessdate = 2008-09-27}}</ref> Burton convinced Disney to drop the idea. "I was always very protective of [''Nightmare''] not to do sequels or things of that kind", Burton explained. "You know, 'Jack visits [[Thanksgiving]] world' or other kinds of things just because I felt the movie had a purity to it and the people that like it", Burton said. "Because it's a mass-market kind of thing, it was important to kind of keep that purity of it. I try to respect people and keep the purity of the project as much as possible."<ref name=MTV/>
