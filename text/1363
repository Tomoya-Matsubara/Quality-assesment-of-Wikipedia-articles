Dmitri Malyanov is a young astronomer, working on stellar astronomy. As he tries to resolve his equations, he feels that he is on the edge of a revolutionnary discovery.

But as he approaches the solution, strange phenomena start occurring all around him, preventing him from finishing his work: telephone ringing all the time, a beautiful girl claiming to be his wife's friend appearing on his doorstep and so on. Coincidence? Malyanov's friends, also researchers experimenting similar disturbances, don't think so...
