"'''The Otto Show'''" is the twenty-second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on April 23, 1992. In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] decides that he wants to become a rock star after attending a [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] concert. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] buy him a guitar, which he shows to [[Otto Mann|Otto]] the bus driver. Otto crashes his school bus and is suspended until he can get his license back. Bart, who respects Otto, invites him to move in with the Simpson family. 

The episode was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] and directed by [[Wes Archer]]. It was the first episode of the show to feature Otto Mann in a prominent role. "The Otto Show" features an appearance from [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]], a parody band that first appeared in the 1984 [[mockumentary]] film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. The episode guest stars [[Michael McKean]] as [[David St. Hubbins]] and [[Christopher Guest]] as [[Nigel Tufnel]]. [[Harry Shearer]], who is a regular ''Simpsons'' cast member, also starred in ''This Is Spinal Tap'' and reprises his role as [[Derek Smalls]].

In its original airing on the Fox Network, the episode had an 11.5 [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] and finished the week ranked 41st. The episode received positive reviews and Spinal Tap was ranked as the 18th best guest appearance on the show by [[IGN]].

==Plot==
Bart, Homer and [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] attend a Spinal Tap concert, but it turns into a comedy of errors and degenerates into a [[riot]] started by [[List of recurring characters in The Simpsons#Snake Jailbird|Snake]]. Nonetheless, Bart is impressed by the aging heavy metal band and wants to become a rock guitarist. Homer and Marge decide to buy Bart his own electric guitar, but Bart struggles to learn how to play it. The next morning on the school bus, Bart tells [[Otto Mann|Otto]] he thinks his guitar is broken, and Otto with the bus still stopped in traffic wows his passengers with an impromptu concert, to which he thoughtlessly clogs up traffic by not moving the bus. However, Otto loses track of time and is forced to drive recklessly to school. The bus runs Spinal Taps bus off the road (causing it to crash and burst into flames, presumably killing Spinal Tap), and causes other chaos before turning over onto its side in the town square. Thankfully, no one else is hurt.

Numerous people call [[Springfield Elementary School]] to report the incident, earning Otto a reprimand from [[Principal Skinner]]. However, when Officer Lou asks for his [[driver's license]] to complete his report, he is forced to admit he doesn't have a license (or wear his own underwear). Otto is suspended without pay, and Skinner takes over his route. Skinner finds driving the bus hard going, being a less aggressive driver than Otto, and ends up being trapped at a busy intersection for an entire day. At first he takes an insulting song the children sing (called "Hail to the Bus Driver", to the tune of Oh du lieber Augustin) with good humour and even sings along, but after being stuck at the intersection, he becomes irritated and snaps at Ralph Wiggum when he tries to continue singing.

Meanwhile, things quickly go downhill for Otto. He fails his driver's test at the Springfield [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]] (not helped when he asks his examiner, [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty]] if she was born a man). He is also unable to find a new job, and therefore cannot pay his rent and is evicted from his apartment. Bart finds him living in a Trash Co. Waste Disposal Unit (since Dumpsters are too top-of-the-line for Otto), and agrees to let him live in the Simpsons' garage. Homer and Marge disapprove of this, and Bart tries to convince them that Marge in fact has agreed to let Otto stay, presenting a tape recording where she did so; in reality though, it features Bart doing a poor impression of his mother. Homer and Marge aren't fooled by this, but reluctantly agrees to let him stay.

Otto quickly makes a nuisance of himself. He becomes comfortable lying around watching game shows, playing Bart's guitar at high volume, and hogging the bathroom. When he clogs up a sink with hair while washing in it, Homer begins to lose patience with him. However, Marge convinces him that at least Otto is good with the kids. At that moment, Otto terrifies Lisa with a scary story, and her scream startles everyone. This is the final straw for Homer, that he makes his demands clear to Bart that Otto either leaves or he'll throw him out and calls him a sponge. Otto is now uncertain about his future, even considering faking his own death. However, Marge and Bart encourage him to give the driving test one last try.

Outside the DMV, an underconfident, Otto mentions that Homer's right about him, he's a bum. Bart corrects him by telling him that his father called him a sponge, not a bum and his favorite bus driver is upset. With renewed confidence, determination and hatred for Homer, Otto quickly marches into the DMV to take the test again. Unfortunately, Patty refuses to let him retake the test for his license because of an earlier comment he made about her being born a man(a question he didn't need to ask). However, Otto refuses to give up by telling her that he has something to prove to Homer: that when he gets his driver's license, he wants to have it stapled to his bald, fat head. This immediately changes Patty's demeanor because she realizes that they have something in common with each other: their hatred for Homer. Right away, she gets Otto started on his writing test and even gives him the answers to it.

During his second driving test: in the parking lot, Otto runs over every single cone, but she doesn't care about that. Patty actually laughs while he continues bad-mouthing about Homer and things he does whenever he's alone, with his family and around people. However, he runs over cardboard cut-outs of pedestrians, but she takes no notice and even offers to buy him a margarita. Despite performing even worse in his second test, Patty grants Otto his license anyway, allowing him to regain his job. Otto proudly shows off his license to Bart, which has a big red stamp of "PROBATIONARY". As Otto drives off into the sunset running two stop signs, with the children singing "Hail to the Bus Driver", Skinner proudly remarks, "Yes, hail to the bus driver, bus driver man."

Actually, it regresses somewhat from the high quality of its predecessors.
