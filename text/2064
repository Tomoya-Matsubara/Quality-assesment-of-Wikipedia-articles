The Cervara or Alfonso class were three light cruisers built for the Spanish Navy in the 1920's. The ships were built by [[Sociedad Espa<U+00F1>ola de Construcci<U+00F3>n Naval]] in [[Ferrol]] which had strong British links and were designed by [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Sir Philip Watts]]. The design was based on the British [[Emerald class cruiser]], but had all boilers grouped together reducing the number of funnels to two. The main armament comprised Vickers pattern 6 inch guns with single mountings in A and Y positions and Twin turrets in B,Q and X positions. The programme was initially authorised in 1915 but was delayed by World War I with construction of the first ship starting in 1917

The Galicia and Cervantes had substantial refits in the 1940's. The 6 inch turret in Q position ws replaced by a catapult for a seaplane and the single 6 inch mountings were replaced by twins to retain an 8 gun broadside. Extra AA guns were fitted in all three ships.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]] she served in the Republican Navy and was interned in Bizerte at the end of the conflict. Returned to Spain in 1938 and renamed ''Galicia''.
* The ''Miguel de Cervantes'' (named after poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]]) was also part the the Republican fleet during the cvil war and was torpedoed by the [[Archimede class submarine|nationalist submarine ''General Mola'']] in 1936. The ship was interned in Bizerte and returned to Spain. She was badly damaged by fire in 1943 and repaired. Represented Spain in the [[Coronation Fleet Review]] in 1953.
*The ''Almirante Cervera'' (named after Admiral [[Pascual Cervera y Topete]]) served on the Nationalist side in the civil war and was present in most of the major battles.
