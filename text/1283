'''Burebista''' ({{lang-grc|<U+0392><U+03C5><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03AF><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C2>, <U+0392><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03C1><U+03B5><U+03B2><U+03AF><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C2>}}) was a king of the [[Getae]] and [[Dacians]], who unified their tribes  for the first time and ruled them between 82 BC and 44 BC. He led plunder and conquest raids across Central and [[Southeastern Europe]], subjugating most of the neighbouring tribes. After his assassination in an inside plot, the empire was divided into smaller states.

== Early references ==
Only three ancient sources on Burebista survive: [[Strabo]]: Geographica 7.3.5, 7.3.11 and 16.2.39 (who spells his name Byrebistas and Boirebistas); [[Jordanes]]: Getica 67 (spells his name Buruista); and a marble inscription found in [[Balchik]], [[Bulgaria]] (now found at the [[National Museum in Sofia]]) which represents a [[Decree of Dionysopolis|decree]] by the citizens of [[Dionysopolis]] about [[Akornion]].<ref>W. S. Hanson, Ian Haynes, ''Roman Dacia: the making of a provincial society'', 2004, Journal of Roman Archaeology, ISBN 1-887829-56-3, p. 34</ref>

==Development of Burebista's polity==
The development of a [[La T<U+00E8>ne culture|La T<U+00E8>ne]]-based economy in 3rd-2nd century BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found both among the Transylvanian Dacians (under the rule of [[Rubobostes]]) and the Moldavian and Wallachian Getae (with a center of power in [[Argedava]]). Burebista was the first to create a union of tribes of both Dacians and the Getae.{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}}
[[File:Burebista statue in Calarasi.jpg|thumb|left|''Burebista'' statue in the Municipal Park of [[C<U+0103>l<U+0103>ra<U+015F>i]]]]
This alliance was probably a weakly centralized state, with a military organization similar to the one of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Kingdoms]].{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} The exact degree of centralization is under debate, with archaeologists, such as [[K. Lockyear]], denying the existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows much regional diversity, with only a few region-wide trends. Others, such as [[A. Diaconescu]], dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.<ref>Jinyu Liu, "[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-03-12.html Review of Roman Dacia. The Making of a Provincial Society]", ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'', March 12, 2005</ref>

During Burebista's rule, the society is sometimes considered to have started developing a [[Slavery in antiquity|system of slavery]] similar to Rome and Ancient Greece, but probably most production was by free people.{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}}

[[Strabo]] wrote that Burebista was able to obtain the complete obedience of his tribe with the help of [[Decaeneus]], a [[Wizard (paranormal)|wizard]] and a [[Divination|diviner]] who learned his craft in Egypt. The people's obedience to Burebista was so complete that they were even persuaded to cut their vines and give up drinking wine.<ref name="StraboVII.3.11">Strabo, ''Geography'', VII:3.11</ref> [[Jordanes]] further claims that the high priest held "almost royal powers" and taught the "Goths" a [[code of laws]] called the "belagines laws", but also ethics, philosophy and sciences, including physics and astronomy.<ref>Jordanes, XI</ref>

In the heart of Burebista's empire, in the [[Or<U+0103><U+015F>tie Mountains]], he built a [[Dacian Fortresses of the Or<U+0103><U+015F>tie Mountains|system of stone fortifications]] on higher ground; the most important of such [[hill fort]]s are located today in the villages of [[Or<U+0103><U+015F>tioara de Sus|Coste<U+015F>ti]], [[Blidaru]], [[Piatra Ro<U+015F>ie]] and [[B<U+0103>ni<U+0163>a]].{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}}

==Conquests and external policy==
Burebista led a policy of conquest of new territories: in 60/59 BC, he attacked and vanquished the [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes of [[Boii]] and [[Taurisci]], who dwelt along the [[Middle Danube]] and in what is now [[Slovakia]]. After 55 BC and probably before 48 BC, Burebista conquered the [[Black Sea]] shore, subjugating the Greek fortresses from [[Olbia]] to [[Apollonia, Thrace|Apollonia]], as well as the [[Pannonian plain|Danubian Plain]] all the way to the [[Balkans]].{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} Strabo also mentions the expeditions against a group of Celts who lived among the Thracians and Illyrians (probably the [[Scordisci]]).<ref name="koch">John T. Koch, ''Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia'', p.550, ABC-CLIO, 2006 ISBN 1-85109-440-7</ref>

The only Greek [[polis]] with which Burebista had good relations was [[Dionysopolis]].{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} According to an [[Decree of Dionysopolis|inscription]] found in this city, [[Akornion]], a citizen of the city was a chief adviser (<U+03C0><U+03C1><U+1FF6><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03C6><U+03AF><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>, literally "first friend") of Burebista.<ref>H. Daicoviciu, p. 127</ref>

At its peak of power, Burebista's empire stretched from modern Slovakian Carpathians to the Balkans and from the Middle Danube to the Black Sea. [[Strabo]] claims that the Getae could raise up to 200,000 soldiers in wartime,{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} a rather improbable number,<ref>Boia, p.184</ref> but which could represent the total number of able males, not the number of any army.{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} Burebista was a worthy adversary for the Romans, as his army would cross the Danube and plunder the Roman towns as far as in [[Thrace]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Illyria]].<ref name="StraboVII.3.11"/>

In 48 BC, Burebista sided with [[Pompey]] during his struggle against [[Julius Caesar]] in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] civil war,{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} sending Akornion as an ambassador and a military adviser. After Caesar emerged as victor, he planned on sending legions to punish Burebista,<ref name="StraboVII.3.5">Strabo, ''Geography'', VII:3.5</ref> but he was assassinated in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] before he could do so, on March 15, 44 BC.

==Death==
Burebista was assassinated in a plot by the tribal aristocracy, who felt that a centralized state would reduce their power. After his death, the empire dissolved, with the exception of the nucleus around the Or<U+0103><U+015F>tie Mountains,{{sfn|Pippidi|1976|p=116-117}} while the rest divided into various kingdoms.<ref name="StraboVII.3.11"/> When [[Augustus Caesar]] sent an army against the Getae, the former state of Burebista was divided into four states.<ref name="StraboVII.3.5"/>

== Legacy ==
In Romania, starting in the 1970s, the [[Nicolae Ceau<U+015F>escu]] regime used a nationalistic and questionable interpretation of ancient history ([[Protochronism]]) as a way to legitimize its own rule.<ref name="Boia221"/> For instance, Burebista, a great conqueror, was seen as merely a "unifier" of the Dacian tribes.<ref>Boia, 177</ref>

As part of this tendency, in 1980 the Romanian government declared the celebration of the 2050th anniversary of the founding of the "unified and centralized" Dacian state of Burebista, drawing comparisons with Ceau<U+015F>escu's Romania and claiming an uninterrupted existence of the state from Burebista to Ceau<U+015F>escu.<ref>Boia, p. 78; 125</ref>

This commemoration led the press to note "similarities" between Burebista and Ceau<U+015F>escu, and even professional historians such as [[Ion Hora<U+0163>iu Cri<U+015F>an]] spoke about Burebista in ways similar to the ways party activists spoke about Ceau<U+015F>escu.<ref name="Boia221">Boia, p. 221</ref>

In 1980, a movie based on Burebista's life was made.<ref name="Boia221"/>
