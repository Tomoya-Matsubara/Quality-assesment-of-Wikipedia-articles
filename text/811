'''''The Garrick Gaieties''''' is a revue with music by [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]], first of a long line of musicals by this [[Rodgers and Hart|songwriting team]]. It was the first of four ''Garrick Gaiety'' revues, which were subsquently produced in 1926 and 1930.  The show parodied current subjects, such as the New York subway system and the [[Theatre Guild]] (producer of the show). The ''Garrick Gaieties'' is remembered as "bringing Rodgers and Hart their first major recognition." Their major hit song "[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]" was introduced in this revue.<ref>Hischak, Thomas S.

==Production==
The revue first opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the Garrick Theatre on [[May 17]], [[1925]], as a 2-performance benefit for the [[Theatre Guild]]. The reviews were favorable, and Rodgers and others persuaded the Theatre Guild to continue the revue, which re-opened on June 8, 1925 and ran until November 28, for 211 performances.<ref name=hyland>Hyland, William. ''Richard Rodgers'' (1998), Yale University Press, ISBN 0300071159, pp. 29- 33</ref>  Several writers contributed the material for the sketches, including Edith Meiser, [[Sam Jaffe]], Benjamin Kaye and [[Morrie Ryskind]].  

Directed by [[Philip Loeb]] with musical staging by [[Herbert Fields]], the cast included [[Romney Brent]], June Cochrane, [[Sterling Holloway]], [[Libby Holman]], Philip Loeb, Edith Meiser, [[Sanford Meisner]], Betty Starbuck, and [[Lee Strasberg]]. 

==Sketches and musical numbers==
The opening number, "Soliciting Subscriptions" was a spoof of the Theatre Guild's "serious pretensions", along with the following song, "Gilding the Guild".  Ryskind wrote skits including a satire of President and Mrs. [[Calvin Coolidge]], and a parody of the [[Scopes Trial]], which was dropped from the show after [[William Jennings Bryan]] died. Libby Holman's solo, "Black and White" was later dropped. Sterling Holloway and June Cochrane introduced the song "Manhattan", as its "easygoing strolling melody and ingeniously rhymed lyric related all of the everyday pleasures to be found in New York..."<ref name=hyland/>
