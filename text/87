'''Gu, Prince of Korea''' (aka '''Yi Ku''', '''I Gu''', '''Lee Gu''') ([[29 December]] [[1931]] &ndash; [[16 July]] [[2005]]) was a claimant to the throne of [[Korea]], contested twenty-ninth head of the [[Korean Imperial Household]], and the grandson of [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] of the Korean [[Joseon Dynasty]].

Gu was born in Kitashirakawa Palace (now [[Akasaka Prince Hotel]]), Kioicho, Kojimachiku, [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]; his father was [[Eun, Crown Prince of Korea|Crown Prince Eun]] of Korea, and his mother was Princess [[Masako Nashimoto|Bangja]], born Masako Nashimoto, a Japanese princess. If his claim had been accepted, and Korea were still a monarchy, his title would have been "His Imperial Highness the Crown Prince of Korea".

Gu attended the [[Gakushuin|Gakushuin Peers' School]] in Tokyo. He later attended [[Centre College]], [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]], [[Kentucky]] and studied architecture at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] both in the [[United States|U.S.]]. He was employed as an architect with I.M. Pei &amp; Assocs, [[Manhattan]], [[New York]] on [[1960]] to [[1964]]. Made stateless by [[Japan]] in [[1947]], Gu acquired [[United States|U.S.]] citizenship in [[1959]], and [[Korea]]n citizenship in [[1964]]. He married [[Julia Mullock]] (b.1928) on [[25 October]][[1959]] at St George's Church in New York, and they adopted a daughter, Eugenia Unsuk.

After the fall of [[Syngman Rhee]], he returned to Korea in [[1963]] with the help of the new president [[Park Chung-hee]], moving into the new building in Nakseon Hall, Changdeok Palace with his mother and wife. He lectured on architecture at [[Seoul National University]] and [[Yonsei University]] and also managed his own airline, [[Shinhan]]. When that went bankrupt in [[1979]], he went to Japan to earn money. In [[1982]], his family forced him to divorce his wife because she was sterile; his mother died in [[1989]]. He started living with a Japanese astrologer, Mrs. Arita. 

In November [[1996]], he made what he hoped would be his permanent return to Korea but, showing signs of a nervous breakdown, he was unable to adjust to life in the motherland. Restlessly going back and forth between Japan and Korea, he eventually died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-four, on [[16 July]] [[2005]] at the Akasaka Prince Hotel, the former residence of his parents in Tokyo, Japan. His funeral was held on [[24 July]] [[2005]] and his posthumous title decided as "Prince Imperial Hoeun of Korea" by the Lee Family Council.
