As the surface continually reshaped itself, over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke up.  The continents migrated across the surface, occasionally combining to form a [[supercontinent]]. Roughly 750&nbsp; [[annum|Ma]] (million years ago) ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004), the earliest known supercontinent [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]], 600<U+2013>540&nbsp; Ma (ICS 2004), then finally [[Pangaea]], which broke apart 180&nbsp;Ma (ICS 2004).<ref>{{cite journal | author=Murphy, J.

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about 40&nbsp;Ma (ICS 2004), then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about 3&nbsp;Ma (ICS 2004).

The geological history of the [[Earth]] can be broadly classified into two periods: the [[Precambrian]] supereon and the [[Phanerozoic]] eon.

== Precambrian ==
{{Main|Precambrian}}
Precambrian includes approximately 90% of geologic time. It extends from 4.6 billion years ago to the beginning of the Cambrian Period (about 570 [[annum|Ma]]). 
It includes 3 eons namely: 

=== Hadean Eon ===
{{Main|Hadean}}
[[Image:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|400px|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
During [[Hadean]] time (4.6 - 3.8 bya), the [[Solar System]] was forming, probably within a large cloud of gas and dust around the sun, called an [[accretion disc]]. The Hadean Eon isn't formally recognized, but it essentially marks the era before there were any rocks. The oldest dated zircons date from about 4400 Ma (ICS 2004)<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6817/abs/409175A0.html Wilde, S. A.; Valley, J.W.; Peck, W.H. and Graham, C.M. (2001) "Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4 Gyr ago" ''Nature'' 409: pp. 175-178] Abstract</ref> - very close to the hypothesized time of the [[History of Earth#Origin|Earth's formation]]. 

During the Hadean period the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] occurred (approximately 3800 to 4100 Ma) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the [[Moon]], and by inference on [[Earth]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus (planet)|Venus]], and [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] as well.

=== Archean Eon ===
{{Main|Archean}}
The Earth of the early [[Archean]] (3.8-2.5 bya) may have had a different tectonic style.  During this time, the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] cooled enough that rocks and continental plates began to form. Some scientists think because the Earth was hotter, that plate tectonic activity was more vigorous than it is today, resulting in a much greater rate of recycling of crustal material. This may have prevented cratonisation and continent formation until the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] cooled and convection slowed down. Others argue that the sub continental lithospheric mantle is too buoyant to [[Subduction|subduct]] and that the lack of Archean rocks is a function of [[erosion]] and subsequent [[tectonic]] events.

In contrast to the [[Proterozoic]], Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as [[graywacke]]s, [[mudstone]]s, volcanic sediments, and [[banded iron formation]]s. [[Carbonate]] rocks are rare, indicating that the oceans were more acidic due to dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] than during the Proterozoic.<ref>John D. Cooper, Richard H. Miller, and Jacqueline Patterson, ''A Trip Through Time: Principles of Historical Geology'', (Columbus: Merrill Publishing Company, 1986), p. 180.</ref> [[Greenstone belt]]s are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating high and low-grade metamorphic rocks.  The high-grade rocks were derived from volcanic [[island arc]]s, while the low-grade metamorphic rocks represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a [[forearc|forearc basin]]. In short, greenstone belts represent sutured protocontinents.<ref>Stanley, pp. 302-3</ref>

=== Proterozoic Eon ===
{{Main|Proterozoic}}

The geologic record of the '''Proterozoic''' (2.5-0.57 bya) is much better than that for the preceding [[Archean]]. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many [[stratum|strata]] that were laid down in extensive shallow [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental seas]]; furthermore, many of these rocks are less [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]] than Archean-age ones, and plenty are unaltered.<ref>{{cite book| last=Stanley| first=Steven M.| title=Earth System History| location=New York| publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company| year=1999| id=ISBN 0-7167-2882-6 | pages= 315}}</ref> Study of these rocks show that the eon featured massive, rapid [[continent]]al accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), [[supercontinent cycle]]s, and wholly-modern [[orogeny|orogenic]] activity.<ref>Stanley, 315-18, 329-32</ref>

The first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic, one began shortly after the beginning of the eon, while there were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the [[Snowball Earth]] of the Varangian glaciation.<ref>Stanley, 320-1, 325</ref>

== Phanerozoic Eon ==
{{Main|Phanerozoic}}
The '''Phanerozoic''' Eon is the current eon in the geologic timescale. It covers roughly 545 million years. During the period covered, continents drifted about, eventually collected into a single landmass known as [[Pangea]] and then split up into the current continental landmasses.
The Phanerozoic is divided into three eras <U+2014> the [[Paleozoic]], the [[Mesozoic]], and the [[Cenozoic]].

=== Paleozoic Era ===
{{Main|Paleozoic}}
The '''Paleozoic''' spanned from roughly 542 Ma (ICS 2004) to roughly 251 Ma (ICS 2004), and is subdivided into six [[period (geology)|geologic periods]]; from oldest to youngest they are: the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]], [[Devonian period|Devonian]], [[Carboniferous]], and [[Permian]]. Geologically, the [[Paleozoic]] starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called [[Pannotia]] and at the end of a global ice age. Throughout the early Palaeozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era, the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called [[Pangaea]], which included most of the Earth's land area.

==== Cambrian Period ====
{{Main|Cambrian}}
The '''Cambrian''' is a major division of the  [[geologic timescale]] that begins about 542 <U+00B1> 1.0 Ma (ICS 2004). [[Cambrian]] continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a [[Neoproterozoic]] supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]] and [[Siberia]] remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. [[Gondwana]] started to drift towards the South Pole. [[Panthalassa]] covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], [[Iapetus Ocean]], and [[Khanty Ocean]].

==== Ordovician Period ====
{{Main|Ordovician}}
The '''Ordovician''' period started at a major extinction event called the [[Cambrian-Ordovician extinction events]] some time about 488.3 <U+00B1> 1.7 Ma (ICS 2004). During the [[Ordovician]], the southern continents were collected into a single continent called Gondwana. Gondwana started the period in the equatorial latitudes and, as the period progressed, drifted toward the South Pole. Early in the Ordovician, the continents Laurentia, Siberia, and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but [[Baltica]] began to move towards Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, [[Avalonia]] broke free from Gondwana and began to head north towards Laurentia. The [[Rheic Ocean]] was formed as a result of this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.

The Ordovician came to a close in a series of [[extinction event]]s that, taken together, comprise  the second largest of the five major extinction events in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] in terms of percentage of [[genus|genera]] that went extinct. The only larger one was the Permian-Triassic extinction event. The extinctions occurred approximately 444-447 Ma (ICS 2004) and mark the boundary between the Ordovician and the following [[Silurian]] Period.
The most commonly accepted theory is that these events were triggered by the onset of an [[ice age]], in the Hirnantian faunal stage that ended the long, stable [[greenhouse]] conditions typical of the Ordovician. The ice age was probably not as long-lasting as once thought; study of oxygen [[isotopes]] in fossil brachiopods shows that it was probably no longer than 0.5 to 1.5 million years.<ref>Steven M. Stanley, ''Earth System History'', (New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999), 358.</ref>  The event was preceded by a fall in atmospheric carbon dioxide (from 7000ppm to 4400ppm) which selectively affected the shallow seas where most organisms lived. As the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]] drifted over the South Pole, ice caps formed on it, which have been detected in Upper Ordovician rock strata of [[North Africa]] and then-adjacent northeastern South America, which were south-polar locations at the time.

==== Silurian Period ====
{{Main|Silurian}}
The '''Silurian''' is a major division of the [[geologic timescale]] that started about 443.7 <U+00B1> 1.5 Ma (ICS 2004). During the [[Silurian]], Gondwana continued a slow southward drift to high southern latitudes, but there is evidence that the Silurian icecaps were less extensive than those of the late Ordovician glaciation. The melting of icecaps and glaciers contributed to a rise in [[sea level]], recognizable from the fact that Silurian sediments overlie eroded Ordovician sediments, forming an [[unconformity]]. Other [[craton]]s and continent fragments drifted together near the equator, starting the formation of a second supercontinent known as [[Euramerica]]. The vast ocean of Panthalassa covered most of the northern hemisphere. Other minor oceans include, Proto-Tethys, Paleo-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, a seaway of Iapetus Ocean (now in between Avalonia and Laurentia), and newly formed [[Ural Ocean]].

==== Devonian Period ====
{{Main|Devonian}}
The '''Devonian''' spanned roughly from 416 to 359 Ma (ICS 2004). The period was a time of great tectonic activity, as [[Laurasia]] and Gondwanaland drew closer together. The continent Euramerica (or Laurussia) was created in the early Devonian by the collision of Laurentia and Baltica, which rotated into the natural dry zone along the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. In these near-deserts, the [[Old Red Sandstone]] sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidized iron ([[hematite]]) characteristic of drought conditions. Near the equator, Pangaea began to consolidate from the plates containing North America and Europe, further raising the northern [[Appalachian Mountains]] and forming the [[Caledonian Mountains]] in [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]]. The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. The remainder of modern Eurasia lay in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay submerged under shallow seas. The deep, enormous Panthalassa (the "universal ocean") covered the rest of the planet. Other minor oceans were Paleo-Tethys, Proto-Tethys, Rheic Ocean, and Ural Ocean (which was closed during the collision with Siberia and Baltica).

==== Carboniferous Period ====
{{Main|Carboniferous}}
The '''Carboniferous''' extends from about 359.2 <U+00B1> 2.5 Ma (ICS 2004), to about 299.0 <U+00B1> 0.8 Ma (ICS 2004).
A global drop in sea level at the end of the Devonian reversed early in the [[Carboniferous]]; this created the widespread epicontinental seas and carbonate deposition of the [[Mississippian]].<ref>Steven M. Stanley, ''Earth System History.'' (New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999), 414.</ref>  There was also a drop in south polar temperatures; southern Gondwanaland was glaciated throughout the period, though it is uncertain if the ice sheets were a holdover from the Devonian or not.<ref>Stanley, 414.</ref>  These conditions apparently had little effect in the deep tropics, where lush [[coal]] swamps flourished within 30 degrees of the northernmost glaciers.<ref>Stanley, 416.</ref> A mid-Carboniferous drop in sea-level precipitated a major marine extinction, one that hit [[crinoid]]s and [[ammonite]]s especially hard.<ref>Stanley, 414.</ref> This sea-level drop and the associated unconformity in North America separate the [[Mississippian period]] from the [[Pennsylvanian period]].<ref>Stanley, 414.</ref> The Carboniferous was a time of active mountain-building, as the supercontinent Pangea came together.  The southern continents remained tied together in the supercontinent Gondwana, which collided with North America-Europe ([[Laurussia]]) along the present line of eastern [[North America]].  This continental collision resulted in the [[Hercynian orogeny]] in Europe, and the [[Alleghenian orogeny]] in North America; it also extended the newly-uplifted Appalachians southwestward as the [[Ouachita Mountains]].<ref>Stanley, 414-6.</ref>  In the same time frame, much of present eastern [[Eurasian]] plate welded itself to Europe along the line of the [[Ural mountains]]. During the Late Carboniferous Pangaea was shaped like an "O". There were two major oceans in the Carboniferous - Panthalassa and Paleo-Tethys, which was inside the "O" in the Carboniferous Pangaea. Other minor oceans were shrinking and eventually closed - the [[Rheic Ocean]] (closed by the assembly of South and North America), the small, shallow [[Ural Ocean]] (which was closed by the collision of [[Baltica]] and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]] continents, creating the Ural Mountains) and Proto-Tethys Ocean.

==== Permian Period ====
{{Main|Permian}}
The '''Permian''' extends from about 299.0 <U+00B1> 0.8 Ma (ICS 2004) to 251.0 <U+00B1> 0.4 Ma (ICS 2004).
During the [[Permian]], all the Earth's major land masses except portions of East Asia were collected into a single supercontinent known as [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea straddled the equator and extended toward the poles, with a corresponding effect on ocean currents in the single great ocean (''[[Panthalassa]]'', the ''universal sea''), and the Paleo-[[Tethys]] Ocean, a large ocean that was between Asia and Gondwana. The Cimmeria continent rifted away from Gondwana and drifted north to Laurasia, causing the Paleo-Tethys to shrink. A new ocean was growing on its southern end, the Tethys Ocean, an ocean that would dominate much of the Mesozoic Era. Large continental landmasses create climates with extreme variations of heat and cold ("continental climate") and monsoon conditions with highly seasonal rainfall patterns. [[Desert]]s seem to have been widespread on Pangaea.

=== Mesozoic Era ===
{{Main|Mesozoic}}
[[Image:249 global.gif|thumb|Plate tectonics- 249 [[annum|MA]] (million years ago)]]
[[Image:290 global.gif|thumb|Plate tectonics- 290 [[annum|MA]] (million years ago)]]
The '''Mesozoic''' extended roughly from 251 Ma (ICS 2004) to 65 Ma (ICS 2004). 
After the vigorous convergent plate mountain-building of the late [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] tectonic deformation was comparatively mild. Nevertheless, the era featured the dramatic rifting of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]]. Pangaea gradually split into a northern continent, [[Laurasia]], and a southern continent, [[Gondwana]]. This created the [[passive continental margin]] that characterizes most of the [[Atlantic]] coastline (such as along the U.S. East Coast) today.

==== Triassic Period ====
{{Main|Triassic}}
The '''Triassic''' period extends from about 251 <U+00B1> 0.4 to 199.6 <U+00B1> 0.6 Ma (ICS 2004). During the [[Triassic]], almost all the Earth's land mass was concentrated into a single [[supercontinent]] centered more or less on the equator, called [[Pangaea]] ("all the land").  This took the form of a giant "[[Pac-Man]]" with an east-facing "mouth"  constituting the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys sea]], a vast gulf that opened farther westward in the mid-Triassic, at the expense of the shrinking [[Paleo-Tethys Ocean]], an ocean that existed during the [[Paleozoic]]. The remainder was the world-ocean known as [[Panthalassa]] ("all the sea"). All the deep-ocean sediments laid down during the Triassic have disappeared through [[subduction]] of oceanic plates; thus, very little is known of the Triassic open ocean. The supercontinent Pangaea was rifting during the Triassic&mdash;especially late in the period&mdash;but had not yet separated.  The first nonmarine sediments in the [[rift]] that marks the initial break-up of Pangea&mdash;which separated [[New Jersey]] from [[Morocco]]&mdash;are of Late Triassic age; in the U.S., these thick sediments comprise the [[Newark Group]].

Because of the limited shoreline of one super-continental mass, Triassic marine deposits are globally relatively rare, despite their prominence in [[Western Europe]], where the Triassic was first studied. In [[North America]], for example, marine deposits are limited to a few exposures in the west.  Thus Triassic [[stratigraphy]] is mostly based on organisms living in lagoons and hypersaline environments, such as ''Estheria'' crustaceans.<ref>Sereno, P. C., 1993, The pectoral girdle and forelimb of the basal theropod Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, v. 13, no. 4, p. 425-450.

==== Jurassic Period ====
{{Main|Jurassic}}
The '''Jurassic''' period extends from about 199.6 <U+00B1> 0.6 Ma (ICS 2004) to 145.4 <U+00B1> 4.0 Ma (ICS 2004).
During the early [[Jurassic]], the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] broke up into the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] and the southern supercontinent [[Gondwana]]; the [[Gulf of Mexico]] opened in the new rift between North America and what is now [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan Peninsula]].  The Jurassic North [[Atlantic Ocean]] was relatively narrow, while the South Atlantic did not open until the following Cretaceous Period, when Gondwana itself rifted apart.

The [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys Sea]] closed, and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Neotethys]] basin appeared. Climates were warm, with no evidence of [[glacier|glaciation]]. As in the Triassic, there was apparently no land near either pole, and no extensive ice caps existed. The Jurassic geological record is good in western [[Europe]], where extensive marine sequences indicate a time when much of the continent was submerged under shallow tropical seas; famous locales include the [[Jurassic Coast]] [[World Heritage Site]] and the renowned late Jurassic ''[[lagerst<U+00E4>tte]]n'' of [[Holzmaden]] and [[Solnhofen limestone|Solnhofen]].<ref name=lasdjur>{{cite web

In contrast, the North American Jurassic record is the poorest of the Mesozoic, with few outcrops at the surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/geology/legend/ages/jurassic.html |title=Jurassic Rocks - 208 to 146 million years ago |accessdate=2007-07-19 |work=nationalatlas.gov |publisher= United States Department of the Interior  }}</ref>  Though the [[Epeiric Sea|epicontinental]] [[Sundance Sea]] left marine deposits in parts of the northern plains of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] during the late Jurassic, most exposed sediments from this period are continental, such as the [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits of the [[Morrison Formation]]. The first of several massive [[batholith]]s were emplaced in the northern [[American cordillera|Cordillera]] beginning in the mid-Jurassic, marking the [[Nevadan orogeny]].<ref>Monroe and Wicander, 607.</ref>  Important Jurassic exposures are also found in [[Russia]], [[India]], [[South America]], [[Japan]], [[Australasia]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

==== Cretaceous Period ====
{{Main|Cretaceous}}
[[Image:100 global.gif|thumb|Plate tectonics- 100 Ma (ICS 2004), [[Cretaceous]] period]]
The '''Cretaceous''' period extends from about 145.5 <U+00B1> 4.0 Ma (ICS 2004) to about 65.5 <U+00B1> 0.3 Ma (ICS 2004).
During the [[Cretaceous]], the late [[Paleozoic]] - early Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its breakup into present day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time.  As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin [[orogeny|orogenies]] that had begun during the Jurassic continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]]. Though Gondwana was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, [[Gondwana]] itself broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and  [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[sea level|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide.  To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds.  At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.<ref>Dougal Dixon et al., ''Atlas of Life on Earth'', (New York: Barnes & Noble Books, 2001), p. 215.</ref> The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].<ref>Stanley, Steven M. ''Earth System History.'' New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999. ISBN 0-7167-2882-6 p. 280</ref>  [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity--or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges--enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nannoplankton]].<ref>Stanley, pp. 279-81</ref>  These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine.  Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] and [[China]]. In the area that is now India, massive [[lava]] beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

=== Cenozoic Era ===
{{Main|Cenozoic}}
The '''Cenozoic''' era covers the 65.5 million years since the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]]. The [[Cenozoic]] era is ongoing. 
By the end of the [[Mesozoic]] era, the continents had rifted into nearly their present form. [[Laurasia]] became [[North America]] and [[Eurasia]], while [[Gondwana]] split into [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Antarctica]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], which collided with the Asian plate. This impact also gave rise to the Himalayas. The Tethys Sea, which had separated the northern continents from Africa and India, began to close up, forming the [[Mediterranean sea]].

==== Paleogene Period ====
{{Main|Paleogene}}
The '''Paleogene''' (alternatively '''Palaeogene''') [[geologic period|period]] is a unit of [[geologic time]] that began 65.5 <U+00B1> 0.3 and ended 23.03 <U+00B1> 0.05 Ma (ICS 2004) and comprises the first part of the [[Cenozoic]] era.
This period consists of the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]], and [[Oligocene]] Epochs.

===== Paleocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Paleocene}}
The '''Paleocene''', lasted from 65.5 <U+00B1> 0.3 Ma (ICS 2004) to 55.8 <U+00B1> 0.2 Ma (ICS 2004).
In many ways, the [[Paleocene]] continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the [[continent]]s continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent [[Laurasia]] had not yet separated into three continents - [[Europe]] and [[Greenland]] were still connected [[North America]] and [[Asia]] were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. <ref name="Hooker"> Hooker, J.J., "Tertiary to Present: Paleocene", pp. 459-465, Vol. 5. of Selley, Richard C., L. Robin McCocks, and Ian R. Plimer, Encyclopedia of Geology, Oxford: Elsevier Limited, 2005. ISBN 0-12-636380-3</ref>  The [[Laramide orogeny]] of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the [[Neogene]]); the components of the former southern supercontinent [[Gondwanaland]] continued to split apart, with [[Africa]], South America, [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north towards [[Europe]], slowly closing the [[Tethys Ocean]], and [[India]] began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the [[Himalayas]].

===== Eocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Eocene}}
During the '''[[Eocene]]''' (55.8 <U+00B1> 0.2 - 33.9 <U+00B1> 0.1 Ma (ICS 2004)), the [[continent]]s continued to [[plate tectonics|drift]] toward their present positions. At the beginning of the period, [[Australia]] and Antarctica remained connected, and warm [[equator]]ial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 mya, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and icefloes north, reinforcing the cooling. The northern [[supercontinent]] of [[Laurasia]] began to break up, as [[Europe]], [[Greenland]] and [[North America]] drifted apart. In western North America, [[Orogeny|mountain building]] started in the Eocene, and huge lakes formed in the high flat basins among uplifts. In Europe, the [[Tethys Sea]] finally vanished, while the uplift of the [[Alps]] isolated its final remnant, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and created another shallow sea with island [[archipelago]]s to the north. Though the North [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] was opening, a land connection appears to have remained between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. [[India]] continued its journey away from [[Africa]] and began its collision with [[Asia]], folding the [[Himalaya]]s into existence.

===== Oligocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Oligocene}}
The '''Oligocene''' epoch extends from about 34 Ma (ICS 2004) to 23 Ma (ICS 2004).
During the [[Oligocene]] the continents continued to [[continental drift|drift]] toward their present positions. [[Antarctica]] continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent [[ice cap]]. [[Orogeny|Mountain building]] in western [[North America]] continued, and the [[Alps]] started to rise in [[Europe]] as the [[African Plate|African plate]] continued to push north into the [[Eurasian plate]], isolating the remnants of [[Tethys Sea]]. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] since the [[Fauna (animals)|faunas]] of the two regions are very similar. During sometime in the Oligocene, [[South America]] was finally detached from [[Antarctica]] and drifted north towards [[North America]]. It also allowed the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.

==== Neogene Period ====
{{Main|Neogene}}
'''Neogene''' Period is a unit of [[geologic timescale|geologic time]] starting 23.03 <U+00B1> 0.05 Ma (ICS 2004). The Neogene Period follows the [[Paleogene]] Period.  Under the current proposal of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS), the Neogene would consist of the [[Miocene]], [[Pliocene]], [[Pleistocene]], and [[Holocene]] epochs and continue until the present.<ref>Lourens, L., Hilgen, F., Shackleton, N.J., Laskar, J., Wilson, D., (2004) <U+201C>The Neogene Period<U+201D>. In: Gradstein, F., Ogg, J., Smith, A.G. (Eds.), ''Geologic Time Scale'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.</ref> 

===== Miocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Miocene}}
The '''Miocene''' extends from about 23.03 to 5.332 Ma (ICS 2004).
During the [[Miocene]] continents continued to [[Continental drift|drift]] toward their present positions. Of the modern geologic features, only the land bridge between [[South America]] and [[North America]] was absent, although South America was approaching the western subduction zone in the [[Pacific Ocean]], causing both the rise of the [[Andes]] and a southward extension of the [[Meso-American]] peninsula. [[India]] continued to collide with [[Asia]], creating more mountain ranges. The Tethys Seaway continued to shrink and then disappeared as [[Africa]] collided with [[Eurasia]] in the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-[[Arabia]]n region between 19 and 12 [[annum|Ma]] ([[International Commission on Stratigraphy|ICS]] 2004) . Subsequent uplift of mountains in the western [[Mediterranean]] region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the Mediterranean Sea (known as the [[Messinian salinity crisis]]) near the end of the Miocene.

===== Pliocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pliocene}}
The '''Pliocene''' extends from 5.332 Ma (ICS 2004) to 1.806 Ma (ICS 2004).
During the [[Pliocene]] continents continued to drift toward their present positions, moving from positions possibly as far as {{convert|250|km|mi|0|lk=on}} from their present locations to positions only 70 km from their current locations. [[South America]] became linked to North America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Pliocene, bringing a nearly complete end to South America's distinctive [[Marsupialia|marsupial]] faunas. The formation of the Isthmus had major consequences on global temperatures, since warm equatorial ocean currents were cut off and an Atlantic cooling cycle began, with cold Arctic and Antarctic waters dropping temperatures in the now-isolated Atlantic Ocean. [[Africa]]'s collision with [[Europe]] formed the [[Mediterranean Sea]], cutting off the remnants of the [[Tethys Ocean]]. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between [[Alaska]] and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 Ma (the start the of the [[Quaternary]] Period), the [[Quaternary glaciation|current ice age]] began.

===== Pleistocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Pleistocene}}
The '''Pleistocene''' extends from 1,808,000 to 11,550 years before present (ICS 2004). 
The modern [[continent]]s were essentially at their present positions during the [[Pleistocene]], the [[tectonic plate|plates]] upon which they sit probably having moved no more than {{convert|100|km|mi|0|lk=on}} relative to each other since the beginning of the period.

The sum of transient factors acting at the Earth's surface is cyclical: climate, ocean currents and other movements, wind currents, [[temperature]], etc. The waveform response comes from the underlying cyclical motions of the planet, which eventually drag all the transients into harmony with them. The repeated [[glacial period|glacial advances]] of the Pleistocene were caused by the same factors.

===== Holocene Epoch =====
{{Main|Holocene}}
The '''Holocene''' epoch began approximately 11,550 calendar years before present (ICS 2004) and continues to the present.
During the [[Holocene]], continental motions have been less than a kilometer. However, ice melt caused world [[Sea level rise|sea levels to rise]] about {{convert|35|m|ft|0|lk=on}} in the early part of the Holocene. In addition, many areas above about 40 degrees north latitude had been depressed by the weight of the Pleistocene [[glacier]]s and rose as much as {{convert|180|m|ft|0|lk=on}} over the late Pleistocene and Holocene, and are still rising today. The sea level rise and temporary land depression allowed temporary marine incursions into areas that are now far from the sea. Holocene marine fossils are known from [[Vermont]], [[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], and [[Michigan]]. Other than higher latitude temporary marine incursions associated with glacial depression, Holocene fossils are found primarily in lakebed, floodplain, and cave deposits. Holocene marine deposits along low-latitude coastlines are rare because the rise in sea levels during the period exceeds any likely upthrusting of non-glacial origin. [[Post-glacial rebound]] in the [[Scandinavia]] region resulted in the formation of the [[Baltic Sea]]. The region continues to rise, still causing weak [[earthquake]]s across [[Northern Europe]].  The equivalent event in North America was the rebound of [[Hudson Bay]], as it shrank from its larger, immediate post-glacial [[Tyrrell Sea]] phase, to near its present boundaries.
