'''Poet in the City''' is a prominent London-based poetry [[Charitable organization|charity]], specialising in large-scale live events aimed at new audiences for poetry. Founded in 1998 as a project of the [[Poetry Society]],<ref name="Learning"/> it became an independent charity in 2006.<ref name="Charity">{{cite web | url=http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ | title=1117354 <U+2013>  Poet in the City: Charity overview | publisher=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] | accessdate=30 August 2014}}</ref> Open to anyone, and free to join, it has a current membership of over 4,000 people and runs about 25 poetry events a year, mainly in central London, including about 12 events a year at [[Kings Place]], an arts venue situated just north of [[London King's Cross railway station|King<U+2019>s Cross station]].  

Poet in the City is a [[venture philanthropy]] charity, building a bridge between the worlds of business and the world of the arts. It has developed a streamlined funding model in which most of the funds it raises are used to support its artistic outputs. Keeping its core costs very low by means of in-kind sponsorships and the use of new technology, the charity also benefits from the support of over 125 active volunteers. In April 2011, Poet in the City was offered National Portfolio Funding by [[Arts Council England]], meaning that it will receive regular funding for a period of four years from 2012. 

==History==

Poet in the City was founded in 1998 as a project of the [[Poetry Society]],<ref name="Learning">{{cite web | url=http://www.poetinthecity.co.uk/learning/ | title=Learning | publisher=Poet in the City | accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref> by [[Rosamund McCarthy]], a lawyer at [[Bates, Wells & Braithwaite LLP]], It involved a number of [[City of London]]-based organisations, mainly law firms, in an annual fund-raising effort. Monies raised were used to deliver schools visits, placing poets in the classroom, and encouraging pupils to read and write poetry.  Early successes included a John Donne event at the Chapter House of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul<U+2019>s]] and an open-air event on the steps of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] on [[National Poetry Day]].

==Rimbaud and Verlaine house==

Poet in the City  inherited a campaign to create an Anglo-French cultural centre at 8 Royal College Street in Camden, the house occupied by the French poets [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[Paul Verlaine]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/chasing-rimbaud/ | title=3AM Magazine <U+2013> Chasing Rimbaud | accessdate=January 2011}}</ref> during their celebrated and stormy sojourn in London in 1873. It played a leading role in the setting up of a new charity, the [[Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation]], to take this initiative forward.
