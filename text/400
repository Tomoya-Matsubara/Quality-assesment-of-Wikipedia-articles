'''Graham Windeatt''' (born [[August 5]] [[1954]]) was an [[Australia|Australian]] long-distance freestyle swimmer of the 1970s, who won a silver medal in the 1500 m freestyle at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Munich Olympics]].

Windeatt made his debut at the [[1970 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edinburgh]], where he claimed gold in the 1500 m. In Munich, he was involved in an epic battle with the reigning 1500 m Olympic champion from [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], the [[United States]]' [[Mike Burton]]. After leading for 600 m, Burton was passed by Windeatt, before reclaiming the lead in the last 300 m. Later in the Olympics, Windeatt came fourth in the 400 m freestyle, which was notable for the victory of teammate [[Brad Cooper]] after the controversial disqualification of American [[Rick deMont]]. Windeatt also placed seventh in the 400 m individual medley and fifth in the 4x200 m freestyle relay. Windeatt was also selected for the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], but he disappointed along with the rest of the team, being eliminated in the heats of the 200 m, 400 m and 4x200 m freestyle events.
